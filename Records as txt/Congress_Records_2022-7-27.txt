PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, our redeemer, we look to 
You, ‘‘the rock from which Your people 
have been cut, the quarry from which 
we have been hewn.’’ You are our foun-
dation, the source of our lives, and the 
inspiration of our breath. 
Lord, 5 months have passed since 
your people in Ukraine have been be-
sieged by the enemy of your desire for 
creation. Deliver Ukraine from the 
hands of tyranny. Speedily may Your 
righteousness draw near. With Your 
strong arm, bring justice to the na-
tions. Grant salvation to those whose 
faithfulness has remained steadfast in 
the face of extreme hardship. 
Respond to their abiding hope, with 
the comfort You surely offer. Look 
with compassion on her ruins, make 
her deserts like Eden, her wastelands 
Your own garden. Free the bounty of 
her fields from the devastation of des-
potism. Allow the produce of her rich 
land to provide for those across the 
globe who desperately depend on the 
yield of her harvest. 
Then may joy and gladness be once 
again found in Ukraine’s cities. May 
the songs of thanksgiving rise up from 
the hearts of her people. 
In the saving power of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
TORRES) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. TORRES of California led the

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ROMAY CATHERINE JOHNSON 
DAVIS 
(Ms. SEWELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the extraordinary life 
and legacy of Mrs. Romay Catherine 
Johnson Davis, who was awarded the 
Congressional Gold Medal for her ex-
traordinary service to our Nation as 
one of the women of the ‘‘Six Triple 
Eight’’ postal battalion during World 
War II. 
At the age of 102, Mrs. Davis is the 
oldest living member of the 6888th Cen-
tral Postal Directory Battalion of the 
United 
States 
Army. 
Throughout 
World War II, this dedicated group of 
African-American women sorted mail 
and care packages to maintain the mo-
rale of American soldiers stationed 
abroad. 
Helping to sort 65,000 pieces of mail 
every shift, Mrs. Davis and her col-
leagues worked tirelessly to uphold the 
battalion’s motto: ‘‘No mail, low mo-
rale.’’ 
Mrs. Davis is a trailblazer for Afri-
can-American women everywhere, and 
it is befitting that her award comes on 
the 74th anniversary of the integration 
of the armed services. 
I was proud to vote in favor of the 
bill to award the Six Triple Eight post-
al battalion to receive the Congres-
sional Gold Medal, the highest civilian 
honor Congress can bestow. 
I ask my colleagues to join me and 
the Montgomery community in cele-
brating the extraordinary life and leg-
acy of Mrs. Romay Catherine Johnson 
Davis. 
f 
VIOLENT CRIME CRISIS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address the violence plaguing so 
many American communities. 
2021 was a historic year for crime in 
major cities like New York City, Los 
Angeles, and even Washington, D.C. 
This year is on track to be even worse. 
Homicides alone are up nearly 50 per-
cent nationwide from 2020. 
We have seen more than 80 inexcus-
able acts of violence against pro-life 
pregnancy centers and churches in re-
cent months. 178 police officers have

tragically been shot so far this year, 
with 33 of them losing their lives. It is 
no wonder so many are retiring or re-
signing; 1,500 men and women in blue 
have stepped down just from the New 
York City Police Department this 
year. 
Congressional 
Democrats need to 
take a stand against those in their 
party who push radical soft-on-crime 
policies, such as defunding the police, 
and, instead, leave wokeness behind to 
support our men and women of law en-
forcement to the fullest extent pos-
sible. 
f 
EVERY AMERICAN NEEDS A 
STABLE WATER SUPPLY 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise as the water level in Lake Mead 
sits at yet another all-time low. Today, 
Lake Mead, which provides water for 25 
million Americans, holds just 27 per-
cent of its capacity. 
Just 40 years ago, as you can see 
here, Lake Mead was actually above 
full capacity. But now we face the 
threat of the worst megadrought in 12 
centuries. 
The clock is ticking, and we must act 
now. 
That is why I am supporting the 
Wildfire Response and Drought Resil-
iency Act. This package includes three 
of my bills to tackle our drought, con-
serve water, enhance our research ca-
pabilities, and keep more water in 
Lake Mead for Nevadans. 
We cannot let politics get in the way 
of this. Water is not a partisan issue. 
Every 
Nevadan, 
every 
American, 
whether 
Democrat, 
Republican, 
or 
Independent, needs a stable water sup-
ply. 
Let’s pass this package and help se-
cure our future. 
f 
WHERE IS YOUR MONEY 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the Biden 
administration is canceling massive 
amounts of student debt. Many bor-
rowers have seen thousands of dollars 
of debt canceled through Biden’s ac-
tions, and that is just the start. The 
administration is getting ready to 
hand out more money courtesy of tax-
payers. 
So, for the two-thirds of Americans 
who never earned a degree, where is 
your money? Where is the money for 
the construction worker in North Caro-
lina or the stay-at-home mom in Ten-
nessee? Why should these Americans 
pay for someone else’s degree when 
they never went to college? 
You know who is getting the money, 
though? Doctors, lawyers, and graduate 
students. Many of these borrowers will 
receive $100,000 or more. 
It is unfair for taxpayers to pay the 
debts of lawyers and doctors who earn 
six figures. 
By appeasing the progressives, Presi-
dent Biden is throwing the middle class 
under the bus. 
f 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST LEAD TO 
A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, conflicts 
of interest lead to a crisis of con-
fidence. 
Government officials shouldn’t be 
able to use their Federal contracting 
authority to line their own pockets. 
Pentagon officials owning stock in big 
defense contractors not only invites 
waste and abuse, it causes Americans 
to doubt whether the Department of 
Defense always spends taxpayer dollars 
in the public interest. 
I am proud that the House passed my 
proposal to ban Pentagon officials from 
owning stock in companies that receive 
over $1 billion in defense contracts. 
This safeguard will better protect the 
hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars 
we send to the Pentagon each year. It 
will help prevent sweetheart deals for 
big defense contractors, and it will re-
duce the self-dealing that erodes trust 
in our government and undermines na-
tional security. 
Americans deserve confidence that 
their government is working for them. 
f 
HONORING BUCK O’NEIL 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the newest Baseball Hall of 
Fame inductee, Buck O’Neil. 
John Jordan ‘‘Buck’’ O’Neil is a na-
tive of Carrabelle, Florida, and signed 
with the Memphis Red Socks in 1937, 
then with the Kansas City Monarchs 
the next year. 
O’Neil was a three-time all-star and 
became a Negro World Series champion 
in 1942. 
O’Neil later served as manager of the 
Monarchs and a scout for the Chicago 
Cubs. 
Buck made history as the first Black 
National League coaching staff mem-
ber and was determined to keep the 
memory of the Negro Leagues alive and 
helped establish the Negro Leagues 
Baseball Museum. 
Last Sunday, Buck was inducted 
posthumously into the National Base-
ball Hall of Fame, a well-deserved and 
long-overdue honor. 
Because of legends like Buck O’Neil, 
America’s favorite pastime is what it is 
today. 
f 
CELEBRATING BYRON BUXTON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate Byron 
Buxton being named to the Major 
League Baseball All-Star roster this 
season. 
This great accomplishment is the 
culmination of a life dedicated to the 
perfection of his craft. 
Byron is a great example of hard 
work paying off. At Appling County 
High School, Byron was a top player on 
his team, and was considered by many 
to be the top prospect entering the 2012 
Major League Baseball draft. 
While 
at 
Appling 
County 
High 
School, Byron played baseball, basket-
ball, and football. 
He eventually committed to play 
baseball at the University of Georgia 
with the intention of playing both 
baseball and football. 
The Minnesota Twins selected Byron 
with the second overall pick of the 2012 
Major League Baseball draft. 
Byron is having an excellent season 
this year in which he was selected to 
participate in the Major League Base-
ball All-Star Game. 
We are so proud of everything Byron 
has accomplished and will continue to 
accomplish. It has been a blast fol-
lowing your career, Byron. We are 
looking forward to big things to come. 
f 
AMERICA IS AT A CROSSROADS 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
our Nation is at a crossroads. 
After 11⁄2 years of one-party Demo-
crat rule, America is on the brink of a 
recession, violent crime is on the rise, 
and our freedoms are under attack like 
never before. 
Homicide rates across the Nation are 
up nearly 50 percent compared to 2020. 
There have been at least 80 incidents of 
pro-abortion vandalism, intimidation, 
and violence since May. 
At a time when 85 percent of Ameri-
cans are concerned about rising crime 
rates, the left is pushing to ban one of 
the most popular firearms in America. 
Not only is this reckless, it is a viola-
tion of America’s Second Amendment 
rights. 
Our country needs leadership. When 
the left is in charge, the only thing 
Americans get is an attack on our free-
doms. 
I will never stop fighting for Missou-
rians and our conservative values.

CHILDREN MUST BE PROTECTED 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, as a former 
prosecutor, I saw many different types 
of crimes committed and many dif-
ferent criminals through court, but

none so heinous as the targeting and 
abuse of our Nation’s children. 
That is why I urge the House to con-
sider legislation that I introduced last 
year, the Child Rescue Act, which is 
currently in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
This bipartisan bill, which I intro-
duced 
with 
Congresswoman 
SPANBERGER, requires the Department 
of Justice to convene with experts to 
focus on protecting children who are 
suffering abusive situations, whether 
this be trafficking, sexual abuse by 
family and trusted adults, or pornog-
raphy. 
Technology companies report more 
than 45 million photos and videos on-
line of children being sexually abused 
in 2018, and the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission also released a report last year 
which studied child sexual abuse image 
producers and found that these crimes 
had increased by 422 percent over the 
last 15 years. 
I am proud to join this bipartisan ef-
fort to develop proactive solutions to 
protect our Nation’s youth and safe-
guard them from heinous predators. 
The Child Rescue Act is a targeted so-
lution supported by child protection 
advocacy organizations, and I urge 
Chairman NADLER and the Judiciary 
Committee to act on this legislation as 
quickly as possible.

RECOGNIZING DR. JON PAUL 
RODRIGUEZ 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, the 
American Humane Association, the 
country’s first national humane orga-
nization, is saving, sheltering, feeding, 
and protecting more than 1 billion ani-
mals around the world each year. 
In honor of noted conservationist 
Wolfgang Kiessling, the American Hu-
mane Association created the Wolfgang 
Kiessling International Prize for Spe-
cies Conservation, recognizing and sup-
porting the work of those who achieve 
significant positive change in the field 
of conservation practice, theory, and 
research. 
After considering the achievements 
of extraordinary candidates from 16 
countries, Dr. Paul Rodriguez, chair-
man of the International Union of the 
Conservation of Nature Species Sur-
vival Commission, was selected as the 
inaugural honoree of the Wolfgang 
Kiessling International Prize for Spe-
cies Conservation. 
I recognize and commend the efforts 
of the American Humane Association, 
Wolfgang Kiessling, and the 2022 award 
winner, Dr. Jon Paul Rodriguez, for 
their outstanding work on behalf of the 
endangered animals which enrich our 
world. 
AMERICANS 
DETAINED 
IN 
FOR-
EIGN COUNTRIES DESERVE AN-
SWERS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, dozens 
of Americans are being detained in for-
eign countries, and this has been 
brought to everybody’s attention by 
the latest deal in Russia. These fami-
lies deserve answers from our State De-
partment about what is being done for 
their cases. 
One of these folks is an east Ten-
nessean, a marine named Matthew 
Heath, who is being held in communist 
Venezuela. Right now, his family is 
back in Tennessee, wondering when 
their boy will come home and what will 
happen to him in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, they deserve real an-
swers from the State Department, not 
just some bureaucratic nonsense. When 
it comes to cases like this, the Federal 
Government needs to be totally trans-
parent, at least with folks’ families. 
On the poster beside me, you can see 
a picture of a mural placed here in 
Washington, 
D.C., 
by 
artist 
Isaac 
Campbell. I spoke with Isaac this week. 
The mural is meant to draw attention 
to the dire situation. It depicts 18 of 
the 64 detained Americans, including 
Matthew Heath. 
The mural isn’t permanent. It will 
wash away with the rain and with nor-
mal wear and tear. That is what it is 
meant to do. As we watch the mural 
deteriorate, we are left to wonder what 
is going to happen to these individuals 
by the time it disappears. Are they 
going to come home, or will they be 
abandoned by our government? 
Their moms and dads, brothers and 
sisters, loved ones and kids deserve an-
swers from our State Department 
about what is really happening to their 
loved ones. 
f 
CHINA NOT KEEPING TRADE 
AGREEMENTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, in Jan-
uary 2020, the United States signed a 
Phase 1 trade agreement with China in 
which China agreed to purchase at 
least $80 billion worth of U.S. agricul-
tural products through 2020 and 2021. In 
2020, the U.S. exported over $27 billion 
worth of ag products to China, includ-
ing soybeans, corn, pork, and wheat. 
America’s farmers and ranchers were 
eager to get back to business globally, 
and restoring our ability to be com-
petitive in China was key to that. Un-
fortunately, China has deflected on 
their part of the agreement, thanks in 
part to President Biden’s softness on 
the world stage. 
Now, President Biden is considering 
rolling back tariffs on cheap Chinese- 
made import products. Let’s be clear. 
Rolling back these tariffs won’t reduce 
inflation; it will only reward bad pol-
icy. 
Instead, the Biden administration 
should be rolling back the regulatory 
assault on American manufacturing 
and production to encourage innova-
tion here on U.S. soil, as well as mov-
ing forward on energy production do-
mestically. 
In the meantime, China should start 
pulling their weight and import the 
American products that they agreed to. 
Otherwise, why do we import so much 
stuff from China? 
We need to send the signal to China 
and others that we will not stand for 
the predatory economic policies that 
we are enduring and that are hurting 
American jobs and hurting the Amer-
ican economy.

July 27, 2022 
Print 117–59, modified by the amendment 
printed in part B of the report of the Com-
mittee on Rules accompanying this resolu-
tion, shall be considered as adopted. The bill,

SEC. 3. House Resolution 517 is hereby 
adopted. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, for the purpose of debate 
only, I yield the customary 30 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Minnesota 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent 
that all Members be given 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1256, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 263, 
the Big Cat Public Safety Act, under a 
structured rule. 
It provides 1 hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources, makes in 
order one amendment, and provides one 
motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 4040, the Advancing Tele-
health Beyond COVID–19 Act, under a 
closed rule. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment from Chairman PALLONE, 
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule deems as passed H. 
Res. 517. 
First, the Advancing Telehealth Be-
yond COVID–19 Act, led by Representa-
tive CHENEY, and I am a proud cospon-
sor, will extend critical telehealth poli-
cies implemented during the pandemic 
while making it easier for seniors to 
access telehealth services. 
We know that because of the pan-
demic, healthcare visits to the doctor 
drastically changed, and these health 
services have become critical to pa-
tients in accessing care. The pandemic 
made access to healthcare difficult, but 
telehealth turned this negative into a 
positive. 
To avoid exposure, many patients, in-
cluding high-risk, vulnerable people, 
choose to visit their doctor by video or 
telephone to receive care. In response 
to the COVID–19 public health emer-
gency, we in Congress authorized bipar-
tisan legislation expanding telehealth 
services for Medicare beneficiaries in 
March 2020. This was especially impor-
tant for our seniors and underserved 
areas, where it is already significantly 
more challenging to access in-person 
care. 
Telehealth is a very popular program 
among populations living in both re-
mote and rural areas and in highly pop-
ulated areas. According to a recent 
study, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults 
over 65 had a video doctor’s visit dur-
ing the pandemic. 
In November 2021, Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services announced 
that it would extend some telehealth 
coverage through 2023. However, cer-
tain telehealth services are scheduled 
to end when the declared public health 
emergency expires. 
Why should we end something, a pro-
gram, that is helping vulnerable people 
access medical care? 
Telehealth is no longer an innovative 
option for accessing healthcare serv-
ices. For many, these services are a 
lifeline. 
H.R. 4040 would extend critical tele-
health policies under Medicare that 
were initially authorized at the start of 
the COVID–19 pandemic through 2024. 
Specifically, H.R. 4040 would provide 
patients with better access to tele-
health regardless of where they are by 
removing geographic barriers. 
It would expand the availability of 
telehealth services for patients by in-
creasing the number of health clinics’ 
eligibility, including federally quali-
fied health centers and rural health 
clinics. 
It will allow flexibility for Medicare 
beneficiaries to access mental health 
telehealth and ensure audio-only tele-
health services under Medicare con-
tinue to be covered. 
These provisions will help increase 
access to care and allow Medicare to 
adapt to innovations in medical tech-
nology, all while reducing healthcare 
costs and significantly reducing wait 
times for patient care. 
H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety 
Act, will improve public safety and 
protect wild animals by prohibiting the 
private possession of lions, tigers, leop-
ards, cheetahs, jaguars, cougars, or any 
hybrid of these species. 
In short, this bill prevents people 
from keeping big cats as pets and helps 
ensure that these animals are not kept 
in inhumane conditions. Many law en-
forcement and first responder groups 
are supportive of this legislation and 
are asking Congress to pass this bipar-
tisan bill to protect themselves and the 
general public. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these two bipartisan bills, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1030 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Cali-
fornia and my colleague on the Rules 
Committee for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Today, we are here to discuss the 
rule providing for consideration of H.R. 
4040, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond 
COVID–19 Act, and H.R. 263, the Big 
Cat Public Safety Act. 
First, H.R. 4040 will extend several 
Medicare telehealth flexibilities that 
were initially utilized during the pan-
demic. 
Telehealth has allowed many Ameri-
cans 
to 
receive 
needed 
healthcare 
across the Nation. While my Repub-
lican colleagues and I appreciate the 
extension of these important programs, 
we believe that permanently author-
izing them is the better option. 
Once again, the Democrats have de-
cided to skip the committee process 
and refuse Republican input or look at 
any possible improvements to the bill. 
I know that many Members will be sup-
porting this bill, but I still must men-
tion 
this 
missed 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen healthcare and telehealth, 
especially for rural Minnesota and 
rural America. 
Second, H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public 
Safety Act, would make it illegal for 
any person to trade, breed, or possess 
any prohibited wildlife species, specifi-
cally exotic big cat species like lions, 
tigers, snow leopards, et cetera. The 
bill would impose civil and criminal 
penalties for violators and grant the 
Federal Government the authority to 
order forfeiture of big cats held in pri-
vate captivity. Many of the provisions 
of this legislation already exist under 
the USDA regulatory scheme. 
More than anything, Mr. Speaker, I 
am wholeheartedly disappointed in how 
my colleagues are managing the re-
maining time left in this Congress. The 
absence of any sense of urgency to fix 
the real problems facing this country is 
incredibly frustrating. 
This country is at the doorstep of a 
recession, but instead of addressing it, 
the U.S. House of Representatives is 
spending time on the regulation of big 
cats. My constituents are calling my 
office because their families are strug-
gling to pay for basic needs like food 
and gas. They are calling because they 
want us to secure national borders and 
address the fentanyl epidemic. They 
are calling because they want to know 
what Congress is doing about rampant 
crime in cities across the country. 
These are the issues facing our con-
stituents. These are the issues they are 
calling about because they are the 
issues affecting their everyday lives 
and the ones we should be focusing on. 
It is because of the irresponsible poli-
cies by Democrats that we have such a 
big hole to dig ourselves out of, and 
now they want to ignore these prob-
lems altogether and take up our pre-
cious time left in Congress to consider 
legislation built off reality TV.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7179 
July 27, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, I ask 
Members to do the same, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, tele-
health is good. Telehealth fraud is not. 
The Cheney bill is remarkably similar 
to a bipartisan measure that I worked 
on last year and got the support of 22 
health-related stakeholders after hold-
ing a productive bipartisan hearing. 
I applaud Representative CHENEY’s 
support for telehealth and her valued 
service to our Nation in general. 
Through no fault of hers, this bill con-
tains a glaring omission. 
Whenever billions of Federal dollars 
are available anywhere, some will try 
to steal it. That is what has happened 
with telehealth. The Justice Depart-
ment has brought one charge after an-
other against hundreds of defendants 
for stealing through fraud billions of 
taxpayer dollars, including charges 
that they brought last week. 
What happens is that someone using 
the telehealth mechanism is ordering 
expensive genetic tests, allergy tests, 
and medical equipment that the pa-
tient does not need and billing the tax-
payer through Medicare. 
My effort to address this is not just 
to see a prosecution of theft after it 
has occurred, but to prevent it and to 
protect taxpayers with an amendment 
that was designed to employ the rec-
ommendations of a nonpartisan com-
mission to prevent and reduce this 
kind of fraud. 
It enjoyed bipartisan support. I saw 
that it was not included under this 
rule. I think that is unfortunate. Ac-
cordingly, Mr. Speaker, I do not sup-
port the rule or the bill. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, if we 
defeat the previous question, I will 
offer an amendment to the rule to im-
mediately consider H.R. 8488, a bill to 
prohibit the Secretary of Energy from 
sending petroleum products from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, 
is an important national security tool 
and safety net for this country. The 
United States has already been improp-
erly depleting the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve 
under 
this 
administration 
since it is refusing to increase domestic 
production during an energy crisis. 
We most certainly should not be sell-
ing our emergency supply to an adver-
sary like China. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
DUNCAN) to speak further on the 
amendment. 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota for 
yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the previous question so that we can 
amend the rule to immediately con-
sider the Protecting America’s Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve from China 
Act. 
H.R. 8488 is a bill introduced by 
Ranking Member RODGERS and me, and 
it is simple. It would prohibit the De-
partment 
of 
Energy 
from 
sending 
America’s 
emergency 
oil 
reserves, 
known as the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve, to China. 
Now the Democrats are in denial 
about why their constituents are pay-
ing so much at the pump for gas and 
diesel fuel. It is directly a result of the 
Biden administration and Democrat 
policies that began the day that Joe 
Biden was sworn in as the President of 
the United States. Because of his war 
on the oil and gas industry, our domes-
tic production and our refining capac-
ity has declined by more than 1 million 
barrels per day since President Trump 
was in office. 
Americans know what they were pay-
ing for gas in January of 2021. They 
know what they are paying for gas 
today. They know they had more 
money in their pocket to spend on 
things for their family. They know 
they are having to make decisions now 
about their travel. It is affecting their 
cost to go to work, to take their kids 
to school, or to go to their place of 
worship. 
Energy prices have surged past his-
toric records. People have been forced 
to pay more than $6 per gallon in some 
regions of the country. Now President 
Biden and the Democrats are looking 
for cover. He is looking to distract the 
American voters from the painful reali-
ties of his anti-fossil fuel agenda by re-
leasing an unprecedented 260 million 
barrels of oil from the SPR, or the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Releas-
ing this oil is going to be no more than 
a blip for gasoline prices. 
It seems as if the White House and 
Democrats are taking victory laps over 
a temporary decrease in the price of 
gasoline. It is because Americans are 
on vacation, they are not driving as 
much, 
they 
are 
staying 
home— 
staycations—and they are not using as 
much. It is a supply and demand issue. 
But it is also a cause and effect issue. 
The cause is the Biden administra-
tion’s Democrat policies against fossil 
fuels because they have some sort of 
utopian ideal that Americans are just 
going to—let’s see, in the words of Sec-
retary Granholm: transition to electric 
vehicles. 
Let me be clear: I like electric vehi-
cles. I think they ought to be a part of 
the mix. In fact, more electric vehicles 
on the road means less emissions and 
better air quality. 
But instead of forcing it, why not let 
the free market work? 
Why not let the free market come up 
with alternatives and more cost-effec-
tive modes of transportation for Amer-
icans versus government policies try-
ing to push this utopian ideal? 
It is not the solution to the energy 
crisis Americans are facing today. Re-
leasing oil from the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve is not the answer either. 
In fact, the Biden administration is re-
leasing more than 1 million barrels per 
day, but it really has nowhere to go be-
cause our refineries are at capacity and 
our pipelines are full. As a result, 
America’s 
emergency 
reserves 
are 
being sent to China which is using it to 
build up its own strategic reserves. 
The irony is that when prices plum-
meted at the onset of COVID, President 
Trump’s Department of Energy wanted 
to buy oil and fill up the SPR. Demo-
crats opposed that. Let’s see, buy low, 
sell high. Oil was really cheap. Presi-
dent Trump wanted to fill up the SPR. 
Now that oil is really high, this Presi-
dent wants to release it and give it to 
China. 
We are going to have to replace it. 
Are we going to replace it at a high 
price? 
The other irony is that this isn’t 
about fossil fuels because President 
Biden traveled 11,000 miles roundtrip to 
Saudi Arabia to beg the Saudis for oil. 
He didn’t beg them for batteries for 
electric cars. He begged them for oil 
which is going to be refined into the 
transportation fuels that we use. 
I have got an idea for President 
Biden and for Democrats: How about 
embrace American energy production? 
How about President Biden travel 
down to Port Fourchon, Louisiana, or 
to Midland, Texas, and talk to Amer-
ican energy producers and ask them 
the question: How can we meet the do-
mestic demand that we have here in 
this country? 
How can we, with American energy 
production, lower the costs for moms 
and dads, American families, here at 
home by American production, pro-
viding American jobs, and producing 
American resources? 
We have been blessed in this country 
with abundant resources in oil and gas. 
Unfortunately, we have been cursed by 
liberal politicians. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from South Carolina. 
Mr. DUNCAN. We have been cursed 
by liberal politicians who want to take 
those abundant resources off the table 
and continue to hurt American fami-
lies who are trying to fill up their car 
just to travel to work, to school, and to 
church. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to defeat the 
previous question, we need to stop sell-
ing or giving, or whatever, oil to 
China—an adversary—and we need to 
focus on domestic energy production. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question so that the 
House can immediately consider this 
important bill. I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this previous question and 
for the replacement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7180 
July 27, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, today Democrats are talking 
about expanding access to healthcare 
and 
helping 
our 
constituents 
live 
healthy lives. That is what Democrats 
are bringing to the floor today in a bi-
partisan way. 
But yet here we are with some Re-
publican colleagues across the aisle 
continuing to insert divisive politics 
into a debate about healthcare, about 
being able to see your doctor, and 
about being able to live a healthy life. 
Perhaps it is because there are billions 
to be made in gun sales or oil sales. 
But Democrats will continue to try to 
find Republicans on the other side to 
save American lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
also thank Mrs. TORRES for being very 
generous with the time of the Rules 
Committee. 
I support all aspects of what I con-
sider to be historic legislation. I would 
like to also thank Mr. HOYER who has 
worked tirelessly to help us to bring 
this legislation to the floor. It will 
mean a lot to many people. It will 
mean an awful lot to me. 
I appreciate anyone who is going to 
vote for it, and I encourage everyone to 
vote for it. 
Today is a unique day in history, and 
I trust that this bipartisan legislation 
will prove such to be the case. 
I am not going to prolong my time. I 
just want to be grateful to all Members 
of the House, including the Speaker, 
the whip, the caucus chair, persons on 
both sides, and the minority leader— 
everyone. I am grateful. I trust that we 
will vote to pass the legislation. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remind my colleague 
from the Rules Committee that, as I 
mentioned before, many of the Repub-
licans plan on supporting the tele-
health bill, although I think we missed 
the opportunity to have Republican 
input and have an improved bill. But 
we are able to do more than one thing. 
My colleague mentioned that this is 
very partisan. Gas and oil prices are a 
serious, serious issue for our constitu-
ents. As I mentioned before, it is about 
their getting to work, it is about their 
getting to school, and it is about their 
getting to church. They need us to ad-
dress the cost of oil and gas. 
The Democrats have really just sim-
ply tried to distract from this issue and 
tried to distract us with all kinds of 
other things and not really talk about 
the issues facing our constituents. 
b 1045 
And like I said earlier, we certainly 
do have Republican support for the 
telehealth bill. As a matter of fact, I 
believe that there are Republican spon-
sors of that bill. 
But I think that what is happening 
now is the Democrats are truly trying 
to distract from the issues that are 
really facing our constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I absolutely agree that we can do 
more than one thing at a time. But un-
fortunately, today should be a day that 
we are working together in a bipar-
tisan way, again, to expand access to 
healthcare for fragile Americans that 
want to have an opportunity and de-
serve to have an opportunity to see 
their doctor. 
So, while my colleagues continue to 
talk about the millions and billions of 
dollars that gun manufacturers and oil 
folks are making, we want to talk 
about expanding healthcare. 
But let me remind my colleagues, 
too, that it is easy to come to the floor 
and rant and rave when you have no 
real ideas to offer or solutions. 
But let’s take a look at the facts. 
The current drop in gas prices is one of 
the fastest declines in over a decade. 
Gas prices have declined by an average 
of 50 cents per gallon over the past 34 
days. The most common price at gas 
stations across the country is now 
$3.99, with around 20,000 gas stations 
across over 30 States. 
But, you see, it is not just about gas-
oline. We are also increasing avail-
ability and options for Americans to 
drive electric vehicles. So we can do 
more than one thing. 
But I urge my colleagues across the 
aisle, if they truly care about tele-
health, if they truly care about im-
proving healthcare options for Ameri-
cans, that we focus on the two bills, 
the rule that we have in front of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just have to say that the calls for 
working together ring hollow to me be-
cause working together should be hap-
pening in markup. Working together 
should be happening in committee 
meetings. But the Democrats have re-
peatedly and consistently chosen to 
skip the committee process and bring 
things directly to the Rules Committee 
and directly to the floor. And so when 
they call for working together, I think 
that that starts at the committee proc-
ess. 
And as for bringing solutions to the 
floor, the Westerman-McMorris Rod-
gers bill that would address the energy 
costs has been brought repeatedly as a 
PQ to the floor. The Democrats had the 
opportunity to take a look at that and 
to vote on it. 
With a more exact answer, I yield 1 
minute to my colleague from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, you 
know, there are some bipartisan issues 
in this bill. There is no doubt about 
that, if the Democrats were to reach 
across the aisle and actually work with 
us. Issues like telehealth are impor-
tant. 
But we are getting ready to break for 
the August recess, and American fami-
lies are hurting because of what they 
are paying at the pump for the price of 
gas. We have the opportunity to stop 
the sale of oil to China and help Ameri-
cans maintain their strategic national 
resource and not give it to China. That 
is what we are asking for. 
Unless we are focused on energy poli-
cies before we go home for recess, there 
are a lot of other things we could do to 
address the pain that Americans are 
feeling right now, this week, before we 
break for the August recess. 
Instead, we are going to have some 
feel-good legislation that won’t even 
pass the Senate. 
We could help American families 
today, yet the Democrats continue 
wanting to try to hoodwink the Amer-
ican people; place blame on Putin and 
others for energy prices, when we know 
what is causing the price at the pump; 
and that is the Biden administration’s 
policies on energy. 
Let’s quit giving oil to China, let’s 
hold that strategic asset, and let’s less-
en the price at the pump by passing 
good energy policy in this country. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Working together means meeting 
each other in the middle when we agree 
or disagree on an issue, finding middle 
ground. That is what this bill does be-
cause some Republicans and Democrats 
agree that the healthcare of the Amer-
ican people is worth so much more 
than nonsense political headlines. 
So today, once again, we come to-
gether, some of us, to help continue to 
save lives by passing this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to 
mention that finding middle ground ac-
tually starts with allowing the minor-
ity input into bills, whether that be in 
committee or offering amendments on 
the floor. But that is where finding 
middle ground and that is where find-
ing bipartisan solutions starts. 
I would also like to remind my col-
league from the Rules Committee that 
this PQ would not stop consideration of 
the bills in the rule. It would simply 
allow consideration of the amendment 
that was proposed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
It is unfortunate that we fail—some 
of us on this floor—to recognize that 
the lead author of this bill is a Repub-
lican member of their caucus. Unfortu-
nately, it is a Republican member of 
their caucus that they no longer find 
conveniently friendly to their agenda 
of hate and division. 
Today, we stand together, and I urge 
my Republican colleagues to support 
this bill, to, again, help Americans find 
the doctor and the healthcare that 
they need in order to live a better life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7181 
July 27, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I have to just mention again, because 
I am confused, and I want it stated 
very clearly what I have said repeat-
edly. There are many Republicans who 
will be supporting the telehealth bill. 
Mr. Speaker, there are many Repub-
licans that will be supporting the tele-
health bill. That is not where I am con-
cerned that we are not addressing con-
stituents’ issues with. 
Where I am concerned about our con-
stituents is the price of gas and the in-
flation that they are facing, and that 
we need to be addressing those issues; 
and that is why we offered the PQ that 
we did. And that is why we have offered 
repeated solutions to the cost of gas 
and the inflation facing our constitu-
ents. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I do continue to be dis-
appointed in my colleagues. It is pos-
sible that they are really this out of 
touch. 
The typical family is now spending 
almost $500 per month. Across the 
country, people are making changes 
like skipping meals, changing driving 
patterns, and even delaying retirement 
to adjust their lives to cope with the 
accelerating inflation; inflation caused 
by out-of-control government spending 
and regulation. 
Cities across the country are experi-
encing record crime waves. We have a 
serious immigration crisis leading to 
the deaths of countless people at our 
southern border and in our hometowns 
because of the fentanyl drug crisis 
crossing along with them. 
I know that, like mine, your offices 
are getting daily calls about all of 
these. Why are we spending time on 
anything that does not work directly 
to solve those devastating problems in 
our country? 
Maybe it is because Democrats want 
to distract us from the fact that their 
policies got us here, rather than fix 
them. We could be discussing genuine 
efforts to stop crime or increase do-
mestic energy production or alleviate 
pressure points to the supply chain. 
But, for the sake of the Green New 
Deal and rampant government spend-
ing, Americans are going to have to 
suffer through inaction on real issues 
facing Americans by this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I 
ask Members to do the same. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
The two bills before us for consider-
ation, H.R. 263 and H.R. 4040, will in-
crease access to critical healthcare 
services and improve public safety. I 
am proud of Representative LIZ CHE-
NEY. 
And while my colleagues continue to 
argue and work against the healthcare 
of the American people, we will stand 
together with those Republicans that 
have the courage to stand up for 
healthcare and healthcare options. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1256 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
8488) to prohibit the Secretary of Energy 
from sending petroleum products from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China, and 
for other purposes. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Energy & Commerce; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8488. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time, and I move the previous ques-
tion on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair 
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum 
time for any electronic vote on the 
question of adoption of the resolution. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 218, nays 
208, not voting 4, as follows:

Whereas we posthumously recognize the

of Congress from 1893 to 1895 and 1896 to 1897, 
and George Henry White (NC–02), Member of 
Congress from 1897 to 1901; 
Whereas, on August 20, 1619, the first 20 
enslaved Africans were brought to what is 
now Fort Monroe, then Point Comfort, in 
Hampton, Virginia against their will; 
Whereas the House of Representatives rec-
ognizes August 20, 2021, as ‘‘Slavery Remem-
brance Day’’ and commemorates the lives of 
all enslaved people while also condemning 
the act and perpetuation of slavery in the 
United States of America and across the 
world; 
Whereas African tribal chiefs captured, 
enslaved, and sold their captives to trans-
atlantic slave traders; 
Whereas, over the period of the Atlantic 
slave trade, from approximately 1526 to 1867, 
millions of humans were abducted and 
shipped from Africa, and 10,700,000 arrived in 
the Americas as personal property; 
Whereas the majority of enslaved Africans 
brought to British North America arrived be-
tween 1720 and 1780; 
Whereas about 6 percent of African cap-
tives were sent directly to British North 
America; 
Whereas, by 1825, the population of the 
United States included about one quarter of 
the people of African descent in what has 
been called the New World; 
Whereas the Middle Passage from West Af-
rica to the West Indies was dangerous and 
horrific for enslaved people; 
Whereas the Middle Passage carried moth-
ers, 
fathers, 
children, 
sisters, 
brothers, 
aunts, uncles, cousins, and individuals from 
all walks of life to slavery in the Americas; 
Whereas, although the sexes were sepa-
rated, men, women, and children were kept 
naked, packed close together, and the men 
were chained for long periods; 
Whereas, according to some historians, 
about 12 percent of those who embarked did 
not survive the voyage; 
Whereas sharks followed the slave ships to 
feed on bodies of slaves thrown overboard; 
Whereas enslaved people suffered a variety 
of miserable and often fatal maladies due to 
the Atlantic slave trade, and to inhumane 
living and working conditions; 
Whereas infant and child mortality rates 
were twice as high among slave children as 
among Southern White children; 
Whereas enslaved people often worked 
from before sunup to after sundown, 6 to 7 
days a week often without food for long peri-
ods of time; 
Whereas enslaved Black families lived with 
the 
perpetual 
possibility 
of 
separation 
caused by the sale of one or more family 
members; 
Whereas it is estimated that approxi-
mately one third of enslaved children in the 
upper South States of Maryland and Virginia 
experienced family separation in one of three 
possible scenarios: sale away from parents, 
sale with mother away from father, or sale of 
mother or father away from child; 
Whereas Nat Turner was born into slavery 
in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1800; 
Whereas Southampton County was home 
to many plantations, and enslaved people 
outnumbered free Whites; 
Whereas Turner learned to read and write 
at a young age, becoming deeply religious; 
Whereas Turner was sold to several dif-
ferent masters over the course of his life, the 
last time in 1830; 
Whereas Turner preached to his fellow 
enslaved people, developing a loyal fol-
lowing; 
Whereas Turner began planning a revolt 
with a few trusted fellow enslaved men from 
neighboring plantations; 
Whereas Turner’s rebellion began in Au-
gust 1831, quickly growing from a small 
handful of enslaved individuals to more than 
70 enslaved and free Blacks; 
Whereas the rebels went from house to 
house 
in 
Southampton 
County, 
freeing 
enslaved people; 
Whereas the rebels were ultimately de-
feated by a State militia that had over twice 
the manpower of the rebels, with three artil-
lery companies reinforcing it; 
Whereas Turner was captured 6 weeks after 
the rebellion was put down, whereupon he 
was promptly convicted and sentenced to 
death; 
Whereas, in retaliation for the uprising, 
Virginia officially executed 56 Black people, 
with at least 100 more killed by militias 
through extrajudicial violence; 
Whereas the rebellion caused widespread 
panic among slaveholders throughout the 
South, resulting in widespread violence 
against enslaved people; 
Whereas, in the wake of the rebellion, the 
Virginia General Assembly passed legisla-
tion making it illegal to teach enslaved or 
free Blacks to read and write; 
Whereas the Underground Railroad was a 
network of individuals who helped around 
100,000 slaves escape North; 
Whereas the railroad began when a ‘‘con-
ductor’’ often posing as a slave would enter 
a plantation and attempt to guide runaways; 
Whereas escapees would travel 10 to 20 
miles each night between safe houses or 
‘‘stations’’ to avoid detection, waiting in 
safe houses for the next along the line to be 
alerted to their presence; 
Whereas individuals running each station, 
many of whom were White, knew only of 
local efforts and not the entire operation; 
Whereas Harriet Tubman, born Araminta 
Ross, lived as an enslaved person through 
her young life where she endured regular 
whippings and suffered a traumatic head in-
jury at the hands of an overseer, causing her 
narcoleptic episodes and migraines through-
out her life; 
Whereas Ms. Tubman escaped from slavery 
along the Underground Railroad, a network 
of abolitionists who guided escaped slaves to 
the North traveling primarily at night to 
avoid bounty hunters; 
Whereas Ms. Tubman returned to the 
South no less than 13 times to free 70 
enslaved persons, including much of her fam-
ily, for which she would be given the name 
‘‘Moses’’; 
Whereas Ms. Tubman deftly led those she 
saved North during the fall and winter when 
their would-be captors stayed inside to avoid 
the cold; 
Whereas, in Ms. Tubman’s own words, ‘‘I 
never ran my train off the track and I never 
lost a passenger’’; 
Whereas, during the Civil War, Ms. Tub-
man served as a nurse, scout, and spy in the 
Union army, becoming the first woman to 
plan and lead a military operation in the 
United States, liberating 700 enslaved people 
in South Carolina; 
Whereas, later in life, Ms. Tubman contin-
ued working to improve the lives of op-
pressed people, raising funds for and building 
schools as well as a hospital in the name of 
formerly enslaved people while participating 
in the women’s suffrage movement; 
Whereas John Brown, an abolitionist who 
ran an important stop on the Underground 
Railroad, dedicated his life to ending slav-
ery; 
Whereas Brown lead a militia in guerrilla 
attacks on proslavery towns in Kansas, los-
ing one of his sons in the struggle; 
Whereas Brown, with the help of Harriet 
Tubman, planned and organized an invasion 
of the South to free all slaves; 
Whereas Brown began his invasion at Harp-
ers Ferry, West Virginia, but was surrounded 
and captured by Federal troops led by Robert 
E. Lee, losing two more sons in the fighting; 
Whereas the 13th Amendment was passed 
by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified 
on December 6, 1865, and provides that ‘‘Nei-
ther slavery nor involuntary servitude, ex-
cept as a punishment for crime whereof the 
party shall have been duly convicted, shall 
exist within the United States, or any place 
subject to their jurisdiction.’’; 
Whereas, beginning in the 20th century, Af-
rican Americans began to relocate from 
Southern farms to Southern cities, from the 
South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West, 
in a movement known as the ‘‘Great Migra-
tion’’; 
Whereas 
the 
relocation 
of 
formerly 
enslaved individuals and their descendants 
also included unfavorable and at times un-
just interactions with law enforcement that 
often resulted in imprisonment and convict 
leasing; 
Whereas convict leasing, also known as 
slavery by another name, was a system that 
allowed prisons to lease imprisoned individ-
uals to private entities, often corporations 
and plantations; 
Whereas the remains of 95 persons, thought 
to be of African ancestry, who were sub-
jected to the State of Texas’ convict leasing 
system were discovered in 2018 at the con-
struction site of Fort Bend Independent 
School District’s James Reese Career and 
Technical Center in Sugar Land, Texas; 
Whereas, while slavery was abolished, de-
scendants of the enslaved continue to live 
with the effects of slavery’s progenies: Jim 
Crow, mass lynching, segregation, police 
brutality, mass incarceration, and institu-
tionalized racism; and 
Whereas, despite the horrors of slavery and 
against all odds, enslaved people became 
thought leaders and revolutionaries and

INSTITUTE 
FOR 
TELECOMMUNI-
CATION SCIENCES CODIFICATION 
ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4990) to codify the Institute 
for Telecommunication Sciences and to 
direct the Assistant Secretary of Com-
merce for Communications and Infor-
mation to establish an initiative to 
support the development of emergency 
communication 
and 
tracking 
tech-
nologies, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4990 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Institute for 
Telecommunication 
Sciences 
Codification 
Act’’ or the ‘‘ITS Codification Act’’. 
SEC. 2. INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION 
SCIENCES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The test center within National Tele-
communications and Information Adminis-
tration (in this subsection referred to as the 
‘‘NTIA’’) represents executive branch agen-
cies on spectrum issues before the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
(2) Understanding radio frequency propaga-
tion characteristics and modeling is a crit-
ical component of making spectrum deci-
sions. 
(3) Federal agencies rely on expert engi-
neering studies, simulations, and analyses to 
make determinations about how to make 
spectrum available for commercial use, in-
cluding through system relocations and iden-
tifying 
spectrum 
sharing 
opportunities 
through the NTIA. 
(4) Clearing of Federal spectrum, when fea-
sible, is the priority action to take to make 
Federal spectrum available for commercial 
uses as required by section 113(j)(1) of the 
National Telecommunications and Informa-
tion Administration Organization Act (47 
U.S.C. 923(j)(1)). 
(5) Sharing of Federal spectrum between 
Federal entities and commercial entities 
provides access to Federal spectrum for com-
mercial uses in circumstances where clear-
ing is not feasible. 
(6) The test center within NTIA, is the 
Government’s premier expert laboratory for 
spectrum research activities, spectrum shar-
ing innovation and testing, spectrum inter-
ference studies, and all activities related to 
advancing next generation wireless tech-
nologies. 
(7) The test center within NTIA is critical 
for undertaking engineering studies and 
analyses that inform clearing or sharing op-
portunities and facilitate policy decisions to 
maximize the efficient use of spectrum re-
sources. 
(b) OPERATION OF TEST CENTER.—Part A of 
the National Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration Organization Act (47 
U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended by adding at 
the end the following:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4990. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4990, the ITS Codification 
Act. 
The Institute for Telecommunication 
Sciences, or ITS, is the premier engi-
neering laboratory of the National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration, or NTIA. Amongst its 
many responsibilities, ITS manages 
various technology development pro-
grams for NTIA and the Department of 
Commerce and oversees cutting-edge 
studies concerning the use of our coun-
try’s airwaves. ITS has played a sig-
nificant 
role 
in 
furthering 
tele-
communication advancements for our 
country’s benefit. 
H.R. 4990 recognizes the numerous 
contributions of ITS by providing it 
with additional statutory authority. 
Specifically, under this legislation, ITS 
will serve as the primary laboratory 
for the executive branch of the Federal 
Government. It will be charged with 
studying the use of innovative sharing 
technologies for our airwaves and im-
proving the interference tolerance of 
Federal systems operating with, or 
using, Federal spectrum. The legisla-
tion also will allow the Assistant Sec-
retary of Commerce for Communica-
tions and Information, acting through 
the head of ITS, to enter into agree-
ments needed to carry out the func-
tions of ITS. 
This bill also requires the Assistant 
Secretary to establish an initiative to 
support the development of emergency 
communication 
and 
tracking 
tech-
nologies. 
These 
technologies 
would 
then be used to locate individuals

trapped 
in 
areas 
where 
mobile 
connectivity may not be available due 
to natural disasters or other dev-
astating events. 
I 
commend 
Representatives 
O’HALLERAN and CARTER for their bi-
partisan work on this bill. This is a 
good bill as it ensures that one of our 
Nation’s key telecommunications fa-
cilities has the necessary tools and re-
sources to not only continue to do its 
work but also expand its activities, in-
cluding by enhancing rescue efforts for 
Americans trapped in disaster areas. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I look 
forward to its consideration in the Sen-
ate. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 4990, the ITS Codi-
fication Act. 
As demand for wireless technology 
continues to grow, we must continue to 
focus on identifying potential opportu-
nities to make more spectrum avail-
able for commercial use, including re-
allocating and sharing spectrum from 
Federal users. 
In order to protect Federal missions, 
these reallocation decisions rely on 
complex technical testing and analysis 
that experts at the Federal Commu-
nications Commission and National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration evaluate. As policy-
makers consider reallocating Federal 
spectrum for commercial use, it is crit-
ical that the FCC and NTIA have the 
information they need to make these 
decisions. 
The Institute for Telecommunication 
Sciences, or ITS, within NTIA plays an 
essential role in conducting the radio-
frequency tests that provide this tech-
nical information. The work ITS per-
forms has led to innovative advance-
ments in the way we manage our air-
waves. 
These airwaves power faster mobile 
connectivity for Americans, and mak-
ing more spectrum available in the fu-
ture is critical to beating China and 
others in wireless and technological in-
novation. 
The 
ITS 
Codification 
Act 
will 
strengthen statutory authority for ITS 
and ensure that the work they do to 
advance United States wireless leader-
ship remains a critical ingredient to 
our success. 
Furthermore, I am proud that H.R. 
4990 went through regular order and en-
joyed unanimous support in both the 
subcommittee 
and 
full 
committee 
markups of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would do the same. This is a significant 
bill. I urge everyone to support it on a 
bipartisan basis, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4990, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CHU). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1254, in lieu of the amendment in the 
nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce printed in the bill, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee

July 27, 2022 
JAYAPAL and the bill’s bipartisan spon-
sors for their work on this important 
piece of legislation. 
Heart 
disease, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
claims a life in the United States every 
34 seconds. In 2020 alone, heart disease 
resulted in the deaths of 697,000 Ameri-
cans. These statistics, which are trou-
bling by themselves, are further shaped 
by systemic health disparities. Black 
men have a 70 percent higher risk of 
heart failure compared to White men, 
and Black women have a 50 percent 
higher risk compared to White women. 
Heart disease is the leading cause of 
death among Hispanic men, and for 
Hispanic women, heart disease is sec-
ond only to cancer. 
The South Asian community is also 
disproportionately impacted by this 
deadly disease. While South Asians 
comprise 23 percent of the world’s pop-
ulation as of 2020, they carry approxi-
mately 60 percent of the world’s global 
burden of heart disease. The increased 
risk and disproportionate impact that 
heart disease has on the South Asian- 
American community in this country 
is often obscured by the lack of data 
specificity, as South Asian Americans 
are often grouped with other Asian 
Americans. 
So H.R. 3771 takes a multipronged ap-
proach to address these trends. The 
legislation allows States to direct cul-
turally appropriate resources to com-
munities that are disproportionately 
impacted by heart disease through 
grants, with the goal of increasing 
awareness and promoting prevention. 
The legislation also supports research 
efforts on cardiovascular disease, type 
2 diabetes, and other heart-related ail-
ments among at-risk populations. 
H.R. 3771 is a bipartisan, common-
sense approach to an undeniable heart 
health and research gap for the South 
Asian-American community. These im-
portant investments will ensure a 
greater understanding with respect to 
individuals disproportionately at risk 
for heart-related disease and will help 
in our efforts to address disparities in 
heart health currently experienced by 
many Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation. 
I just want to thank Representative 
JAYAPAL, again, because, as you know, 
Madam Speaker, I have a very large 
Asian-American community, and many 
of them, particularly the healthcare 
providers, have pointed to the problems 
disproportionately with heart disease. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my concerns with H.R. 3771, the 
South Asian Heart Health Awareness 
and Research Act of 2022. 
Investing in the health of all Ameri-
cans through innovative and targeted 
programming has been a priority for 
House 
Republicans. 
We 
have 
been 
steadfast in our support for heart 
health promotion and cardiovascular 
research through consistent and robust 
funding of the National Institutes of 
Health and most recently through pas-
sage of Congressman BARR’s H.R. 1193, 
the Cardiovascular Advances in Re-
search and Opportunities Legacy Act. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 3771, the South 
Asian Heart Health Awareness and Re-
search Act of 2022, that we are dis-
cussing today will do nothing to mean-
ingfully improve cardiovascular health 
of Americans. 
Energy and Commerce Committee 
Republicans have repeatedly expressed 
concerns throughout the entire legisla-
tive process. There are already numer-
ous Federal initiatives at the CDC, the 
NIH, and the Patient-Centered Out-
comes Research Institute which are al-
ready 
dedicated 
to 
cardiovascular 
health. What the CDC really needs to 
do is refocus on its original mission of 
controlling and responding to infec-
tious diseases. 
After extending itself in so many di-
rections in their interest of prevention 
and public health, the CDC has become 
nearly incapable of adequately address-
ing serious threats posed by infectious 
diseases, especially novel ones for 
which there is little information about 
risks, spread, and treatment. Now is 
not the time to create duplicative pro-
grams when the CDC’s management of 
an ongoing pandemic and the current 
monkeypox 
outbreak 
has 
arguably 
been abysmal. 
Former FDA Commissioner Scott 
Gotttlieb was recently quoted as say-
ing that it may be too late to control 
and contain the monkeypox and com-
pared CDC’s response to the start of 
the COVID–19 pandemic saying that 
the U.S. is making a lot of the same 
mistakes, such as a lack of testing and 
not enough vaccines. 
I couldn’t agree more. 
The window to getting this under 
control is closing fast. There are other 
concerning infectious diseases that 
need to be addressed. Ghana just re-
cently 
declared 
an 
outbreak 
of 
Marburg virus, an incredibly infectious 
and deadly virus that needs to be ad-
dressed by the global health commu-
nity immediately before it gets out of 
hand. 
Addressing and preventing heart dis-
ease is important. Make no mistake 
about that. But the ever-expanding 
portfolio of public health issues is sim-
ply not sustainable. We don’t need an-
other duplicative public health preven-
tion initiative that further erodes the 
CDC’s focus. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL), who is the bill’s spon-
sor. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman PALLONE for all the 
work he has done. I know he has a big 
API community in his district, so we 
appreciate 
his 
attention 
to 
these 
issues. 
I am very proud to rise in support of 
my bipartisan bill, the South Asian 
Heart Health Awareness and Research 
Act, and I thank my colleague from the 
other side of the aisle, Representative 
JOE WILSON, as well as several other 
Republicans who have cosponsored this 
bill and for leading on this issue with 
me. 
Every 38 seconds, a person in the 
United States dies from cardiovascular 
disease. It is the leading cause of 
death, regardless of gender, for most 
racial and ethnic groups in America. 
But within those groups, South Asian 
Americans have the highest death rate 
from heart disease nationwide. 
Now, one of the things I love about 
Congress is that when we have rep-
resentation of various diverse commu-
nities, we are able to bring up issues 
that our constituents raise to us or 
that we feel very viscerally. I first in-
troduced this bill in 2017 after the 
mother of Ven Neralla, my then-legis-
lative director and who is still a staff 
member here in Congress, tragically 
died suddenly of heart disease. As we 
started researching the issue what we 
learned is that South Asian Americans 
are four times more likely to develop 
heart disease than the general popu-
lation. 
As the first South Asian-American 
woman in the House of Representa-
tives, I am aware of the barriers that 
our communities experience to address 
this epidemic. Much of our knowledge 
about the risks within this community 
is actually thanks to relatively new re-
search and personal experience. We just 
don’t exhibit the typical risk factors 
for heart disease, which hinders early 
diagnosis and prevention measures, not 
only within our own community but 
within the broader group of people who 
have heart disease. 
So while my bill does focus on the 
South Asian community, it benefits all 
Americans, and it is careful in the 
bill—in working through language with 
Republicans last year and in this Con-
gress—to make sure that we have that 
multipronged approach. It is even more 
important as we continue to grapple 
with the lasting impacts of COVID–19. 
The American Heart Association says 
that heart disease will likely continue 
to kill more Americans than any other 
cause as ‘‘ . . . the influence of COVID– 
19 will directly and indirectly impact 
rates of cardiovascular disease preva-
lence and deaths for years to come. 
. . .’’ 
Ven’s mom would have turned 80 this 
year. His family is just one of millions 
who have lost a loved one because of 
heart disease. But her death will not be 
in vain. This bill will help prevent 
other families from undergoing this 
same tragedy. By passing this bill, not 
only will we prevent deaths within the 
South Asian community, but we will 
also increase awareness and under-
standing of cardiovascular disease that

will benefit the health and well-being 
of every American. 
Again, I am grateful to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who understand the importance of this 
bill and have really stepped up to help 
me pass this legislation on the floor 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on passing this 
bill and saving lives. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS). 
Dr. 
MARIANNETTE
MILLER- 
MEEKS is someone who is no less than 
an expert in public health. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative CAR-
TER for yielding me time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Republican motion to re-
commit H.R. 3771. 
We can all agree that preventing 
myocardial events in Asian Americans 
and all populations is important, but 
the health of our children coming 
through the pandemic is critical. 
The Republican motion to recommit 
would 
require 
the 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services to submit 
a report to Congress on the education 
crisis in K–12 public schools as a result 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. This report 
would include the total number of days 
schools were closed, the impact that 
school closures had on our most vul-
nerable 
population—which 
includes 
both academic achievement and men-
tal health—and the amount of class-
room instruction time that was lost. 
As a mother of two children, I under-
stand how important it is for all kids 
to be in school and learning among 
their peers. Unfortunately, throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic, many schools 
had vaccine mandates, masking re-
quirements, and virtual-only learning 
which has resulted in students paying 
the price through learning loss. The re-
port to Congress this motion to recom-
mit authorizes will provide us with the 
data that will help us move forward 
from this pandemic. 
Early in the pandemic there was a lot 
of focus on limiting people’s inter-
actions with others. However, by sum-
mer of 2020, I would argue that the risk 
of keeping schools closed and how to 
reopen them as safely as possible was 
known. In fact, this was widely the 
practice in Europe. 
As a physician and former Iowa di-
rector of public health, I recognize that 
children are at infinitesimally low risk 
of severe illness with COVID. In fact, in 
February of 2021, The New York Times 
reported that 86 percent of pediatric 
disease experts recommended in-person 
schooling regardless of vaccination sta-
tus. In addition, a recent study found 
that grade-schoolers are at a lower risk 
than vaccinated adults. 
By using transparent data from the 
CDC, we can make the best decisions 
for students when it comes to in-person 
instruction, vaccine and masking man-
dates, and their mental health, given 
the startling rise in youth suicide. 
I believe that it is imperative for stu-
dents to go to school and have in-per-
son instruction. Our future leaders de-
pend on the best education possible, 
which starts in the classroom. Let me 
repeat that: in the classroom. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of the Re-
publican motion to recommit. As we 
are entering a new school year after 2 
years of a pandemic, our students de-
serve to be back in the classroom 
among their peers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BUSTOS). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may to consume 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 3771, 
the 
bipartisan 
South 
Asian 
Heart 
Health Awareness and Research Act, 
which will not only raise awareness 
about the prevalence of heart disease 
in the South Asian community but 
save lives across our country. 
I thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL for 
introducing this very important bill. 
Language barriers, stigma, a lack of 
data surrounding AANHPI health, and 
the rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and vio-
lence are just some of the challenges 
communities of color face in accessing 
healthcare. South Asian Americans, in 
particular, have four times the risk of 
heart disease compared to the general 
population. 
The factors behind this epidemic of 
heart disease among this community 
are not understood, and, more impor-
tantly, preventative measures are rare-
ly shared. This bill before us today will 
tackle these issues and help to reverse 
these frightening trends and better 
protect South Asian-American commu-
nities nationwide, as well as patients of 
all races and ethnicities. 
Specifically, this bill will create 
heart health promotion grants at the 
Centers for Disease Control to develop 
culturally appropriate materials to 
promote heart health, so that no one 
loses out on lifesaving information just 
because of the language they speak. It 
would also establish a clearinghouse of 
information on heart health through 
the NIH and conduct research on car-
diovascular disease and other heart ail-
ments among communities dispropor-
tionately affected by heart disease, 
such as South Asian Americans. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of this 
legislation and have been proud to sup-
port its endorsement by the Congres-
sional Asian Pacific American Caucus 
which I chair. This bill is going to save 
lives, and we must pass it today.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Let 
me 
just 
thank, 
again, 
Ms. 
JAYAPAL and others on a bipartisan 
basis. This is a very important bill for 
my district in many areas where we 
have a large South Asian community. 
And one of the things that Ms. CHU 
mentioned was the data. Oftentimes, 
we don’t have the data, and just get-
ting the information, in itself, is going 
to be significant as a result of this bill. 
I ask for support on both sides, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3771, known as the South 
Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research 
Act of 2021. 
This bill establishes programs that support 
heart-disease research and awareness among 
communities disproportionately affected by 
heart disease, like the South Asian community 
within the United States. 
The South Asian American community 
across the United States grew by nearly 40 
percent between 2010 and 2017. Today, there 
are over 5 million South Asian Americans in 
the United States. 
South Asian Americans are four times more 
likely to suffer from heart disease than other 
ethnic groups, and experience heart problems 
nearly a decade earlier on average. 
Globally, South Asians have emerged as 
the ethnic group with the highest prevalence 
of Type 2 diabetes, which is a leading cause 
of heart disease. 
Type 2 diabetes often occurs due to a com-
bination of a patient’s genetics, and environ-
ment. Those with South Asian heritage contain 
a genetic predisposition that places them at an 
even greater risk for Type 2 diabetes, and by 
extension, heart disease. 
Studies have shown that South Asians in 
the United States—people who immigrated 
from or whose families immigrated from coun-
tries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri 
Lanka and Nepal—are experiencing dramatic 
rises in rates of heart disease when compared 
to other immigrant groups within the United 
States. 
As a co-chair of the Congressional Pakistan 
Caucus and a member of the Congressional 
India Caucus, I’ve had the pleasure of engag-
ing with members of the South Asian commu-
nity, especially within my hometown of Hous-
ton. Texas has one of the highest populations 
of South Asian Americans, along with Cali-
fornia and New Jersey. 
This bill would direct the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary 
to create grants to provide funding for commu-
nity groups involved in South Asian heart 
health advocacy, while also developing cul-
turally appropriate materials to promote heart 
health in the South Asian community. 
These culturally appropriate materials to 
promote heart health would be tailored by 
health care providers who best understand the 
specific needs of the South Asian community 
within the United States. 
It would also direct the HHS Secretary to 
fund grants through the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) to conduct research on cardio-
vascular disease and other heart ailments. 
Organizations like the South Asian Heart 
Center and the South Asian Health Initiative 
would be eligible for these opportunities. 
These organizations work to educate mem-
bers of the South Asian American community

about their increased risk for heart disease, 
lead prevention efforts through programs that 
promote healthy lifestyles, and work on re-
search towards understanding why South 
Asian Americans are at an increased risk for 
heart disease. 
This legislation would be instrumental in im-
proving the health and wellbeing of millions of 
Americans. It is endorsed by a number of 
health organizations such as: 
the American College of Cardiology, 
American Heart Association, 
American Medical Association, 
American Stroke Association, 
WomenHeart: The National Coalition for 
Women with Heart Disease, 
American Association of Physicians of In-

South Asian Public Health Association, 
Hindu American Foundation, 
Hindu American Physicians in Seva, 
South Asian Health Lifestyle Intervention, 
Bangladsh Medical Association of North

South Asian Heart Center. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3771. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 3771, the ‘‘South Asian Heart 
Health Awareness and Research Act of 2022.’’ 
As Chairwoman of the House Health Sub-
committee, I’m proud to have advanced this 
bipartisan bill and I’m pleased to support it on 
the Floor today. 
‘‘The South Asian Heart Health Awareness 
and Research Act of 2022’’ sponsored by 
Representatives JAYAPAL and FITZPATRICK pro-
motes research and awareness of heart health 
for communities that are disproportionately af-
fected by heart disease. 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause 
of death in the U.S., but it is a dispropor-
tionate killer. According to the American Col-
lege of Cardiology, South Asian Americans 
are four times more likely to die from cardio-
vascular disease than any other ethnic group 
in the U.S. Despite these alarming statistics, 
researchers still do not fully understand why it 
is such a targeted threat. 
This legislation provides $1 million annually 
for the next five years to advance research 
and awareness of heart health for the most 
vulnerable American communities. 
‘‘The South Asian Heart Health Awareness 
and Research Act’’ was introduced in the 
115th Congress, passed the House in 116th 
Congress, and is past-due to become law in 
the 117th Congress. I urge my colleagues to 
help close this health disparity gap in our 
country and support this important bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate on the bill has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. PALLONE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
432. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk that 
was made in order by the rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman from New Jersey rise as the 
designee for the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey? 
Mr. PALLONE. Yes, I will be the des-
ignee in lieu of Ms. SHERRILL. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 2, strike lines 15 through 22 and insert 
the following: 
‘‘(c) REPORTS TO CONGRESS.— 
‘‘(1) STUDY ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CER-
TAIN RATES OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AS A 
RESULT OF HEART DISEASE IN AT-RISK POPU-
LATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days 
after the date of enactment of this section, 
the Secretary shall seek to enter into an 
agreement with the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (or, if 
the National Academies decline to enter into 
the agreement, another appropriate entity) 
under which the National Academies (or 
other appropriate entity) will conduct a 
study of the relationship between COVID–19 
and rates of morbidity and mortality as a re-
sult of heart disease in at-risk populations, 
such as South Asian communities in the 
United States. 
‘‘(B) REPORT.—Not later than 5 years after 
the date of enactment of this section, the 
Secretary shall submit to the Congress a re-
port on the results of the study under sub-
section (a). 
‘‘(2) REPORT ON OUTREACH.—Not later than 
180 days after the date of the enactment of 
this section, and annually thereafter, the 
Secretary shall submit to Congress a report 
on outreach efforts and data relating to 
heart disease in communities disproportion-
ately affected by heart disease, such as 
South Asian communities in the United 
States.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1254, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the underlying 
bill, H.R. 3771, and to offer an amend-
ment that focuses on the impact of 
COVID–19 on rates of heart disease in 
at-risk communities. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taken an 
immeasurable toll on the American 
people. Over one million people have 
lost their lives, and countless more will 
suffer long-term health impacts as a 
result of the disease. 
There is an undeniable link between 
COVID–19 infections and ongoing heart 
complications. A study published in 
Nature Medicine in February of this 
year concluded the risk of heart prob-
lems 1 year after COVID–19 infection is 
substantial. 
COVID–19 can indirectly attack the 
heart through lack of oxygen, causing 
the heart to overwork and contributing 
to cell death and tissue damage in the 
heart and other organs. It can also in-
fect the heart’s muscle tissue, leading 
to tissue damage and inflammation, 
stress 
cardiomyopathy, 
and 
blood 
clots. 
And as a result, COVID–19 has only 
widened 
heart 
health 
disparities 
around the country. During the pan-
demic, Black, Hispanic, and Asian pop-
ulations in the U.S. experienced a dis-
proportionate rise in deaths caused by 
heart disease. 
This amendment directs the Sec-
retary of HHS to enter into an agree-
ment with the National Academies of 
Science, Engineering, and Medicine, or 
another appropriate entity, to conduct 
a study on the relationship between 
COVID–19 and rates of morbidity and 
mortality as a result of heart disease 
in at-risk communities. 
We must take steps now to under-
stand the scope of the relationship be-
tween COVID–19 and heart disease in 
our most vulnerable populations. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to express my concerns 
with the amendment offered by Rep-
resentative SHERRILL to H.R. 3771, the 
South Asian Heart Health Awareness 
and Research Act of 2022. 
The amendment requires the Sec-
retary to enter into an agreement with 
the National Academies of Science, En-
gineering, and Medicine, to study the 
relationship between COVID–19 and 
rates of morbidity and mortality as a 
result of heart disease in at-risk popu-
lations. 
This amendment is highly duplica-
tive of ongoing work at the National 
Institutes of Health. A basic web 
search for research on this issue on the 
National Library of Medicine’s PubMed 
yields over 13,000 publications, reviews, 
and clinical trial data. 
Furthermore, the NIH has an entire 
resource 
page 
titled 
‘‘How 
Does 
COVID–19 Affect the Heart.’’ That page 
links to several studies funded by the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute. 
This duplicative amendment will add 
additional costs to the bill, as author-
izing the National Academies generally 
requires about $1 to $2 million to con-
duct studies. What a waste of precious 
taxpayer dollars. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Ms. JAYAPAL), the sponsor of 
the bill. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of Representatives 
SHERRILL’s amendment to study the re-
lationship between COVID–19 and rates 
of morbidity and mortality due to 
heart disease. 
And while it is true the gentleman is 
correct, that there is research out 
there, the reality is also that there 
needs to be more, and that the studies 
that are out there right now prove 
some elements, but not the entire caus-
al relationship. 
In a large study of COVID–19 sur-
vivors conducted by the VA, research-
ers found increased frequency of abnor-
mal heart rhythms, heart muscle in-
flammation, blood clots, strokes, heart 
attacks, and heart failure in patients 
who had COVID–19. The cardiac effects 
of COVID–19, however, are extremely 
widespread, and not broadly under-
stood.

I am just going to say, I also have 
personal experience with this. After my 
husband contracted COVID–19 from me, 
after I got it when some colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle did not want 
to wear masks on January 6 in the safe 
room, he, unfortunately had a series of 
heart attacks and had to have a series 
of heart operations last year. 
Every single doctor said to us, we 
need more research on exactly what 
the causal relationship is. And this is 
the reality of where we are today; and 
I think that this amendment by Rep-
resentative SHERRILL is a very good ad-
dition to the bill. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I oppose this amendment. I 
think it is duplicative, and I think it is 
a waste of taxpayers’ money. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I

mittee, provided that such statement has been 
submitted prior to the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1

the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce or their respective des-
ignees. 
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) and the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) each will control 
30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and add extraneous material on 
H.R. 4040. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4040, the Ad-
vancing Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 
Act, bipartisan legislation, introduced 
by Representatives CHENEY and DIN-
GELL. 
Over the course of this pandemic, 
telehealth has served as an important 
tool for staying connected to care 
without increasing the risk of exposure 
to COVID–19. And in the Medicare pro-
gram, millions have utilized telehealth 
for the first time during the pandemic, 
thanks to actions taken early on by 
Congress and the administration. 
When the pandemic was beginning to 
take hold in America, Congress moved 
quickly to significantly expand access 
to 
telehealth 
for 
Medicaid 
bene-
ficiaries. And this was critically impor-
tant because Medicare beneficiaries are 
some of the most vulnerable to COVID– 
19. 
The waiver of Medicare’s originating 
site and geographic restrictions during 
the public health emergency has al-
lowed 
millions 
of 
Medicare 
bene-
ficiaries nationwide to receive tele-
health services, including audio-only 
services, without ever having to leave 
their homes. 
Now, the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has a long history of working to 
expand access to telehealth services in 
the Medicare program. For example, 
the SUPPORT Act expanded access to 
substance use disorder services deliv-
ered via telehealth. 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2021 permanently expanded access to 
telemental health services and Medi-
care. And most recently, the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act of 2020 ex-
tended key telehealth flexibilities for 
an additional 5 months after the end of 
the public health emergency. 
So H.R. 4040 builds on the bipartisan 
telehealth extension included in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2022. The bill extends the same key 
telehealth flexibilities as the previous 
legislation, but now would extend them 
until December 31, 2024, essentially 2 
more years. And this longer-term ex-
tension will provide beneficiaries and 
stakeholders with more certainty. 
It will also give policymakers time 
to assess the impact expanded tele-
health services have had on the Medi-
care program and on beneficiaries’ 
health and well-being, and the quality 
of care that they are receiving. 
So I thank the many Energy and 
Commerce Committee members who 
have been leaders on this issue over the 
years, such as Representatives DIN-
GELL, ESHOO, MATSUI, WELCH, BLUNT- 
ROCHESTER, KELLY, and many more. 
And I also commend Representative 
CHENEY and DINGELL for their bipar-
tisan leadership on this legislation 
today. 
I look forward to working with all 
Members on a permanent solution to 
address 
telehealth 
coverage 
under 
Medicare but, in the meantime, this 
multi-year extension is critical for pre-
serving access to telehealth services. 
The language included in the bill is 
the same bipartisan language pre-
viously negotiated by the House and 
Senate committees and the bill—and I 
stress, Madam Speaker, that the bill is 
fully paid for. 
So I hope we can, once again, extend 
these flexibilities with strong bipar-
tisan support. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, one of my top prior-
ities since I have been a Member of 
Congress has been to make sure that 
healthcare is accessible and available 
for 
all 
Americans. 
Telehealth 
has 
played a critical role for patients to ac-
cess the care they desperately need. 
b 1245 
On the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, we have been discussing the 
importance of telehealth flexibilities 
for years. It is bringing doctors right 
into families’ living rooms and is an 
example of how innovation can im-
prove and save people’s lives. 
As the coronavirus spread and pro-
viders closed their doors, patients and 
providers were forced to adapt and uti-
lize telehealth services. Just months 
into the public health emergency, 
Medicare was receiving over a million 
telehealth visits a week, an almost 
3,000 percent increase. Those without 
adequate transportation or in rural 
areas were still able to visit with their 
doctor. 
While we have made great strides in 
making telehealth more broadly avail-
able, we know that Congress can do 
more. Increasing access to telehealth 
means increasing access to quality care 
for all patients. 
I often discuss how, before the pan-
demic, we had a lot of regulations and 
red tape that piled up over the years. 
So while I will support this legislation, 
it is a shame that we did not take 
something 
as 
important 
as 
this 
through committee to make sure it 
could be the best possible product. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this legislation, 
which would provide critical extensions 
of existing telehealth flexibilities that 
have been in place during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
The Advancing Telehealth Beyond 
COVID–19 Act of 2021, which I co-led 
with my colleague, Congresswoman 
CHENEY, will do just that. It will ex-
tend a broad range of telehealth flexi-
bilities that are central to enabling ac-
cess to care via telehealth from any lo-
cation through December 31, 2024. 
This includes allowing any site in the 
United States, including a patient’s 
home, to be considered an eligible orig-
inating site for the delivery of tele-
health services. It also extends other 
vital services, including coverage of 
certain telehealth services delivered 
via audio-only format. 
Collectively, these changes will build 
on what has worked during the pan-
demic. It will expand access to quality, 
affordable healthcare across the coun-
try, particularly in rural and under-
served communities. 
It will also, Madam Speaker, allow 
those who have been afraid to go to the 
doctor, who haven’t been able to get in, 
to be able to consult with medical pro-
fessionals as they need it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7191 
July 27, 2022 
I thank my colleague, Congress-
woman CHENEY, for partnering with me 
on this effort, as well as Chairman 
PALLONE for his thoughtful leadership 
and input on the legislation before us 
today. 
It is also important to recognize 
other leading voices on the telehealth 
issue in the Congress, including Con-
gressman MIKE THOMPSON for his pio-
neering efforts on this issue. 
This legislation is a bipartisan win 
for 
the 
American 
people. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), the ranking member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gen-
tleman yielding. 
I grew up in a small town, Kettle 
Falls, and I have lived through the 
challenges that people face in rural 
communities. 
I have also visited hospitals and 
healthcare facilities all throughout my 
district. During the pandemic, Provi-
dence Health System scaled up their 
telehealth services with a 1,000 percent 
increase in volume. 
Telehealth visits by seniors on Medi-
care increased from 840,000 in 2019 to 
52.7 million in 2020 nationwide. Many of 
these visits were from seniors’ homes, 
which were not paid for by Medicare 
prior to the pandemic. 
Congress and the Trump administra-
tion, by action, required Medicare to 
pay for more telehealth services, re-
ducing out-of-pocket costs and expand-
ing the availability of telehealth serv-
ices and long-term care where people 
are especially vulnerable to COVID–19. 
This bill today makes some of those ac-
tions last beyond the public health 
emergency through 2024. 
While I support this legislation, I do 
think this is a missed opportunity to 
do more. Republicans on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee have many 
solutions to not just look at telehealth 
and Medicare for a couple of years but 
to look also at how we incentivize em-
ployers to provide access to telehealth 
for an estimated 156 million people 
with employer health insurance. 
We have examined and worked on so-
lutions to address both where tele-
health may not be appropriate and 
where it drives better outcomes for pa-
tients. 
Healthcare providers and patients 
need certainty. The pandemic has made 
it clear that telehealth can and should 
be a part of modernizing healthcare. 
I plan to support this legislation and 
hope to continue to work to unwind 
the public health emergency in a way 
that 
provides 
patients 
and 
our 
healthcare providers the certainty that 
they need. I do think that we could 
have done more on this and hope that 
this process won’t be a model for the 
rest. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. MATSUI), a mem-
ber of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4040, the Ad-
vancing Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 
Act, legislation to further extend tele-
health policies that have been critical 
to providing care during the pandemic 
through the end of 2024. 
Since long before the COVID pan-
demic, I worked closely with my En-
ergy and Commerce Committee col-
league, Representative BILL JOHNSON, 
in crafting legislation to remove bar-
riers to telehealth and advancing poli-
cies that expand access and improve 
the quality of care for Medicare bene-
ficiaries. 
As a cosponsor of this bill, I am 
pleased to see some of that important 
work make progress today. This legis-
lation builds on Congress’ efforts to 
give patients and providers the cer-
tainty they need that telehealth is 
here to stay. 
While this bipartisan telehealth bill 
meets many of our shared objectives, 
we also must recognize that our work 
on telehealth is not done. There are 
vital telehealth priorities still demand-
ing our attention that will truly shape 
care delivery for the future, including 
the need to extend the DEA in-person 
waiver for remote prescribing of con-
trolled substances after the public 
health emergency ends. 
Likewise, while this bill continues a 
crucial delay of the in-person tele-
mental health requirement, we cannot 
allow an arbitrary and clinically un-
supported in-person requirement to act 
as a barrier to mental health care when 
the pandemic extensions run out. 
I look forward to continuing this 
work with my colleagues. This is a 
really good bill, but we want to ensure 
that permanent Medicare policy sup-
ports telehealth in ways that ensure 
beneficiaries can continue to get the 
right care in the right place at the 
right time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS), an im-
portant member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. CARTER for his support. 
I rise today in support of the Advanc-
ing Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 Act. 
There is no putting the genie back in 
the bottle. COVID–19 highlighted the 
importance of telehealth, especially in 
providing quality care for rural com-
munities. This bill would extend tele-
health 
offered 
through 
Medicare 
through the end of 2024. 
Like many of my colleagues, I would 
like to see that go longer. This bill in-
cludes a provision I have supported in 
my bill, the Protecting Mental Health 
Services Act, which extends mental 
health services delivered through tele-
health. 
While Utah has, for the most part, re-
turned to regular life, it is important 
that we keep in place those flexibilities 
that give Utahns control over their 
healthcare decisions. 
I support this bill and am pleased the 
Protecting Mental Health Services Act 
was included. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support its passage. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. 
CHENEY). 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. I ap-
preciate it. 
I am very pleased, Madam Speaker, 
that today the House will have the op-
portunity to vote on this important bi-
partisan legislation. It is an unusual 
circumstance to have a bill that has 
such broad bipartisan support. 
I know many of my colleagues have 
worked on many different aspects of 
the bill that we are going to consider 
and vote on today. I am honored to be 
an original cosponsor of this bill, along 
with my good friend from Michigan, 
Congresswoman DINGELL, who spoke 
earlier. 
All of us, I think, around the coun-
try, especially in rural America, saw 
the impact of COVID on the ability of 
our constituents to get the treatment 
that they need. We first began working 
on legislation to expand telehealth ca-
pabilities more than 2 years ago, fol-
lowing the onset of the pandemic. 
In Wyoming, we have long known 
how important it is for citizens to be 
able to take advantage of the tech-
nology that exists today, how crucial 
telehealth services are in allowing all 
of our citizens to interact with their 
doctors and their other healthcare pro-
viders, and we saw this, in particular, 
during the pandemic. 
We know it is vital that Medicare 
adapt to the ever-changing innovation 
in medical technology that allows tele-
health services, and this legislation 
really will expand freedom for patients 
by giving them more flexibility and 
more capability to use telehealth serv-
ices. 
Specifically, the legislation removes 
geographic requirements, and it ex-
pands originating sites so that Medi-
care beneficiaries can receive care at 
any site. It can expand the practi-
tioners who are able to furnish tele-
health services, and it also provides for 
audio-only telehealth. 
I am very pleased that this extension 
through 2024 was fully paid for using 
the Medicare Improvement Fund, and 
the CBO has shown that it will not in-
crease direct spending. 
Madam Speaker, in Wyoming, espe-
cially, we know how important this is, 
how important telehealth access is. 
Many of our citizens live hours away, 
hundreds of miles away, from their 
closest medical provider. I am very 
proud that this bill has the support of 
the Wyoming Hospital Association, in 
addition to the American Medical As-
sociation and a number of other crucial 
groups whose mission is to serve pa-
tients and provide quality care. 
While I know we in this body will 
continue to have legitimate and impor-
tant ongoing policy debates about

healthcare, there is, as I said, broad bi-
partisan agreement for expanding ac-
cess so that all of our citizens can re-
ceive high-quality care. That needs to 
continue to be a top priority. This bill 
does just that by allowing more Ameri-
cans to utilize telehealth services. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle for 
joining me in advancing our bill to this 
point, and I urge all Members to vote 
in favor of this legislation so more citi-
zens can connect and receive care from 
the 
medical 
professionals 
of 
their 
choice. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
One of the many lessons we learned 
during the pandemic is the ability to 
take care of patients who are safely in 
their own homes. It was truly a high-
light. 
Understanding that we will not be 
going back to the status quo of 2019, we 
must recognize how telehealth has al-
lowed our country to take a monu-
mental step forward toward digitally 
enabled care. 
Telehealth has allowed Americans to 
take care of immediate and necessary 
health needs from their homes without 
the costs and health risks that are 
often associated with an in-person 
visit. They don’t incur costs for park-
ing. They don’t have to take time off 
from work. They don’t have to hire a 
babysitter. 
While I am in support of this legisla-
tion, it does not go far enough. We do 
need to provide a permanent solution 
for Medicare providers and, most im-
portantly, their patients. 
It is important that providers are 
given long-term certainty when taking 
care of their Medicare patients and are 
technologically capable of delivering 
the best care possible. 
Yesterday, I introduced, along with 
Representatives 
GREG
MURPHY
and 
YVETTE HERRELL, H.R. 8506 to perma-
nently extend Medicare coverage of 
telehealth services for federally quali-
fied health centers and rural health 
clinics. 
This important permanent extension 
would ensure that following the pan-
demic, providers and patients continue 
to have access to telehealth flexibili-
ties, especially in rural and under-
served areas. These are arguably com-
munities that have benefited the most 
from an increase in telehealth access. 
We will continue to see innovation 
and technology that will further influ-
ence how we deliver care to American 
patients. We need to keep up with the 
times. This bill is an important step, 
but it is not the end of the discussion.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. 
DOGGETT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with 
telehealth 
helping 
so 
many 
throughout this pandemic, we should 
certainly continue its benefits, as I 
proposed in bipartisan legislation last 
year, and for which I secured the sup-
port of 22 health-related stakeholders. 
But we don’t have to accept billions of 
dollars of fraud, of theft of taxpayer 
funds as the price for maintaining tele-
health. 
Here is what has been happening: In-
formation for some patients who want-
ed a COVID–19 test was used fraudu-
lently to bill Medicare for expensive 
cancer genetic tests and allergy tests 
without any medical necessity or any 
knowledge of the patient. In other 
cases, expensive medical equipment in 
no way needed by the patient was or-
dered. 
The wrongdoing has been exposed by 
the General Accountability Office, the 
Health and Human Services inspector 
general, and is the subject of Justice 
Department prosecutions for literally 
billions of taxpayer dollars. Through 
no fault of the gentlewoman from Wyo-
ming (Ms. CHENEY) or Chairman PAL-
LONE, this bill fails to address this 
theft. I offered an amendment to the 
bill that was recommended by an inde-
pendent, 
nonpartisan 
commission 
called MedPAC, mandating reasonable 
steps to prevent or at least signifi-
cantly reduce this telehealth fraud. 
Outrageous interference with the con-
sideration of this bill is denying the 
House today any opportunity to con-
sider this antifraud amendment. 
My amendment would have required 
in-person visits within 6 months prior 
to ordering this high-cost lab testing 
or DME—medical equipment—as well 
as an audit of outlier clinicians whose 
orders for these very high-cost services 
and devices are largely made through a 
telehealth appointment. This has to 
stop, and we need to prevent the fraud, 
not just prosecute it and get back a few 
pennies for the taxpayer per dollar 
after it has occurred. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, this 
bill costs $132 million per month. With-
out these targeted provisions to pre-
vent Medicare from being looted, I 
must vote against it. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON), an-
other valuable member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, this should be a happy occa-
sion because major telehealth legisla-
tion is being brought to the floor on its 
own. Finally. 
As a co-chair of the bipartisan Con-
gressional Telehealth Caucus, my fel-
low caucus members and I have been 
pushing for telehealth to be recognized 
for its true value for years. Years. 
So here we are, and those of us who 
are leaders on the Congressional Tele-
health Caucus, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, Ways and Means, 
and are all longtime champions for 
telehealth reforms, we have been com-
pletely left out of the process. 
The product we have before us today 
is a small step in the right direction, 
but the American people deserve bet-
ter. This legislation, conceived in a 
last-minute deal, is, sadly, a missed op-
portunity. 
This legislation, well, frankly, it 
looks familiar. It removes geographic 
restrictions, enables telehealth access 
in 
the 
home, 
protects 
telemental 
health services—reforms we have been 
seeking for years now. 
But it is time to decouple important 
telehealth reforms from this never-end-
ing public health emergency. Kicking 
the can down the road another year- 
and-a-half, as this legislation does, just 
isn’t sufficient. 
During COVID–19, temporary tele-
health expansion was a real bright 
spot. It eased burdens on a strained 
medical system, protected at-risk pa-
tients, and in rural Appalachian dis-
tricts like mine, I heard from countless 
constituents who were very relieved 
that they could access care from their 
home instead of the common half hour 
or even longer to drive to the appoint-
ments they needed. 
Now, Madam Speaker, it is time for 
permanent reforms. I am proud to have 
introduced H.R. 8493 with my col-
leagues VERN BUCHANAN and MICHELLE 
STEEL to make real long-term reforms 
to telehealth. This, coupled with the 
additional alternative proposals my 
colleagues have offered today, would do 
just that. 
Clearly, as you can see, Madam 
Speaker, the Speaker of the House has 
the will to take on this challenge. But 
this bill on the floor today? Well, I am 
going to support it, but I am afraid it 
is just a start. We have more to do. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers at this 
time. We may have one more, but not 
at this time. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. VALADAO). 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on 
this. Telehealth is critical for rural and 
low-income communities like many in 
my district, and I absolutely support 
this bill. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
telehealth was widely used since we 
were not able to see our healthcare 
providers in person. Even before the 
pandemic, many of my constituents 
were not able to go to their health ap-
pointments because oftentimes the of-
fice was way too far, or they did not 
have the transportation to get to their 
provider. 
Through this legislation, the Advanc-
ing Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 Act, 
some of the healthcare flexibilities we 
have seen since 2020 would be extended 
for another 2 years. This action is very 
necessary, but I also believe it is in the

best interests of our constituents to 
take these flexibilities and make them 
permanent. 
I introduced a companion bill with 
my colleagues that would make perma-
nent the expanded list of practitioners 
eligible to provide telehealth services. 
Congresswoman CHENEY’s bill is a 
great starting point, but I encourage 
my colleagues to make these flexibili-
ties permanent so our constituents can 
have access to the care even after the 
public health emergency declaration 
has ended. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, but I think Repub-
licans may have additional speakers. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Again, let me be clear about my 
standing on this bill. I support this 
bill. We support telehealth. We are all 
in favor of telehealth, but we also sup-
port the fact that we have committees 
that this type of legislation needs to go 
through, and we missed an opportunity 
here to make this a better bill. That is 
simply what we are saying. 
No one is saying they are not in favor 
of telehealth. Telehealth has become 
an integral part of our healthcare sys-
tem during this pandemic. There is no 
question about that. All of us agree on 
that. It needs to be extended. 
But, again, the committee process is 
exceptionally important, and we need 
to make sure that we follow that, par-
ticularly when we are talking about 
subject matter as important as this be-
cause it is important. 
Again, since I have been a Member of 
Congress, I have been working to make 
healthcare accessible and available, 
and telehealth does just that. This is 
exactly what we want, but there are 
ways that we could have made this bet-
ter. 
One example is that we need to make 
sure there is no waste, fraud, and 
abuse. That is one thing that could 
have been tightened up in this legisla-
tion. 
Another example is to make sure 
that we are not having any informa-
tion that is inadvertently or inten-
tionally being released. That is ex-
tremely important as well. 
So again, there are ways that we 
could have made this legislation better 
if we had gone through the committee 
process, which is a process that is ex-
tremely important. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Nebraska is recognized 
and controls the time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 19 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
4040. This bill would extend telehealth 
flexibilities under Medicare until 2024. 
These flexibilities allow physicians to 
be more widely available to patients 
who no longer need to wait weeks for a 
visit or take hours off work to sit in a 
doctor’s office. 
While I support this bill, I am dis-
appointed that the majority did not 
follow the regular committee process, 
which could have further improved the 
bill in a bipartisan way. 
For example, the committee could 
have incorporated elements of the 
Greater Access to Telehealth Act, 
which I am proud to co-lead with the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) and the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). This bill would 
extend the telehealth flexibility until 
2026 and includes policies to support 
health savings accounts. But the ma-
jority did not follow regular order, and 
that is a great disservice to a common-
sense bill like H.R. 4040. 
Regardless, and despite the proce-
dural irregularities, I support the bill, 
and I encourage my colleagues to vote 
for H.R. 4040. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4040. There have been a few sil-
ver linings that we have seen in the 
pandemic, and definitely telehealth has 
been one of them. 
I will submit, I am personally thank-
ful for this bill because I will say, 
maybe, perhaps I am the only sitting 
Member of Congress who, as a physi-
cian, has actually used telehealth. 
In my surgical practice, I see pa-
tients from 2 hours north, 2 hours 
south, and sometimes 5 hours east out 
on the eastern North Carolina coast. 
So many of my patients who come 
from rural eastern North Carolina 
can’t even afford gas in the infla-
tionary environment we have to even 
travel these distances, much less some-
times across town. 
While this bill is a good start, it is a 
very, very good start, it does not go far 
enough, and that is why I, with Dr. 
BURGESS and Congresswoman HERRELL, 
introduced a bill to permanently ex-
tend telehealth for federally qualified 
health centers and rural health cen-
ters. These are the medical practices 
that take care of our poorest and the 
most at-risk patients. These individ-
uals need to be able to access tele-
health because they have to travel long 
distances and don’t have the resources 
that they need to be able to access phy-
sician care. 
I subsequently urge my colleagues to 
support this initiative and urge them 
that we can do much more. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I will be brief in my re-
marks here. 
I know that you have heard several 
concerns expressed about this entire 
process, and I would certainly share 
those concerns. 
I do think that this is a great oppor-
tunity to address a bipartisan issue 
that is important across America. But 
it appears this bill was negotiated 
quickly, in secret, and outside the com-
mittees of jurisdiction. Neither outside 
stakeholders nor Members who have 
worked extensively on telehealth pol-
icy were consulted, as far as I can tell, 
and the closed rule under which this is 
being considered has precluded any op-
portunity to improve or amend the bill. 
An issue this important deserves an 
open and transparent process that fol-
lows regular order, allowing Members 
to offer input and highlight important 
needs which might otherwise have been 
overlooked. We call this legislating. 
If we had worked together on the 
Ways and Means Committee with our 
Energy and Commerce friends and had 
included the various ideas and innova-
tions, this would have been a true and 
real bipartisan bill. I am confident that 
the telehealth extension we are consid-
ering today would be even better, as 
has been mentioned by my colleagues. 
In fact, back in May, I introduced a 
bipartisan bill almost identical to this 
one called the Connecting Rural Tele-
health to the Future Act. That bill ex-
tended all the provisions included in 
the FY22 omnibus through at least 2024 
and also included provisions to ensure 
critical access hospitals can continue 
to provide telehealth services to their 
patients. It also corrects a flaw in the 
CARES Act which shortchanges feder-
ally qualified health centers and rural 
health clinics which offer telehealth 
services. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD two letters from the National 
Rural Health Association and the Na-
tional Association of Rural Health 
Clinics expressing their support for 
both the aims of H.R. 4040 as well as 
the need to extend critical rural health 
provisions from the Connecting Rural 
Telehealth to the Future bill.

Act (CAA), 2022, until December 31, 2024. 
NRHA supports the extension of telehealth 
flexibilities to show providers that tele-
health is here to stay but urges rural friend-
ly tweaks to the legislation. 
NRHA is a non-profit membership organi-
zation with more than 21,000 members na-
tionwide that provides leadership on rural 
health issues. Our membership includes 
every component of rural America’s health 
care, including rural community hospitals, 
critical access hospitals, doctors, nurses, and 
patients. We provide leadership on rural 
health issues through advocacy, communica-
tions, education, and research. 
As the text is currently written, H.R. 4040 
includes the extension of distant-site status 
for 
Federally 
Qualified 
Health 
Centers 
(FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) at 
their current reimbursement level. While 
continuation of this flexibility is necessary, 
the reimbursement level for virtual services 
is significantly lower than in-person services 
under current statute. Should reimburse-
ment remain as it is currently written, by 
2028 there will be nearly a $100 discrepancy 
between services provided in-person and vir-
tually at RHCs. NRHA believes this will 
cause rural communities to utilize these im-
portant services less often than their urban 
and suburban counterparts moving forward 
and will cause harm to an already fragile 
rural safety net. 
To remedy this discrepancy, NRHA urges 
this text be amended to incorporate reim-
bursement updates as reflected in Section 9 
of H.R. 7876, the Connecting Rural Tele-
health into the Future Act, introduced by 
Representatives Adrian Smith (R–NE) and 
Terri Sewell (D–AL). Incorporating this leg-
islative text will bring payment parity be-
tween in-person and virtual care at RHCs 
and FQHCs and ensure that rural commu-
nities have access to the same health care 
delivery methods as their urban and subur-
ban counterparts. 
NRHA applauds the House of Representa-
tives for acting on telehealth to show pro-
viders long-term stability. However, to en-
sure that rural providers, and their patients, 
can properly utilize these services tweaks 
are needed. 
Sincerely, 
ALAN MORGAN, 
Chief Executive Officer. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
RURAL HEALTH CLINICS, 
July 26, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: The National Association of Rural 
Health Clinics (NARHC) is grateful that the 
House of Representatives is considering ex-
tending Medicare coverage of telehealth 
through 2024 but we are concerned that the 
current language in H.R. 4040 will perpetuate 
inequitable payment policies for safety-net 
providers. 
Presently, our peers in traditional office 
settings are able to bill for telehealth serv-
ices as if the service was provided physically 
in the office. In other words, they have cod-
ing and reimbursement parity between tele-
health services and in-person services. 
On the other hand, Rural Health Clinics 
(RHCs) and Federally Qualified Health Cen-
ters (FQHCs) do not use their normal coding 
and reimbursement rules for telehealth. 
RHCs and FQHCs instead have a ‘‘special 
payment rule’’ that requires them to bill a 
single code, G2025, for all telehealth services 
which is then reimbursed at a single nation-
wide rate (currently $97.24). 
We are concerned with this ‘‘special pay-
ment rule’’ methodology for a whole host of 
reasons. First and foremost, the payment is 
significantly less than what most RHCs and 
FQHCs would receive for providing the same 
service in person, disincentivizing safety-net 
providers from offering the service via tele-
health. Second, the current rules require 
RHCs and FQHCs to ‘‘carve-out’’ all tele-
health costs from their cost report, which 
adds significant administrative burden to 
the cost-reporting process. Third, the use of 
a single telehealth code, G2025, has prevented 
RHCs from tracking annual wellness visits 
and other services provided via telehealth se-
verely hindering their ability to properly 
participate in ACOs and other quality pro-
grams. 
Complicating matters is the fact that for 
mental health services provided via tele-
health, RHCs and FQHCs do use their normal 
coding and reimbursement mechanisms. This 
policy is working well, and we believe that is 
should work this way for all services, not 
just mental health services. 
NARHC strongly believes that the best way 
to encourage telehealth usage in underserved 
communities is to create parity between in- 
person and telehealth policies. We strongly 
encourage Congress to amend H.R. 4040 to in-
clude the payment policy enumerated in Sec-
tion 9 of H.R. 7876, the Connecting Rural 
Telehealth to the Future Act introduced by 
Representative Adrian Smith and Represent-
ative Terri Sewell. 
Please feel free to contact me if you would 
like to discuss this issue further. 
Sincerely, 
NATHAN BAUGH, 
Executive Director, 
National Association of Rural Health Clinics. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, these organizations fully un-
derstand the vital role that rural 
health clinics and FQHCs and critical 
access hospitals play in ensuring access 
to care for those in rural and under-
served areas. 
Even with the passage of this bill, 
the future of telehealth after the gov-
ernment-designated 
public 
health 
emergency is uncertain. More work 
needs to be done to assess what has 
worked well over the last 2 years, what 
can be improved, and what can safely 
be left behind. 
While I do encourage Members to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, I hope in the fu-
ture we can work in a true bipartisan 
fashion under regular order to address 
the gaps that we know exist in policy 
and set a long-term, sustainable course 
for telehealth well beyond 2024. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN), a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 4040, which will main-
tain seniors’ access to telehealth, or 
what should be more appropriately 
called virtual health. 
In 2020, the Trump administration 
eliminated bureaucratic red tape so 
seniors could access healthcare vir-
tually from the comfort of their homes. 
As a result, 52 million seniors sought 
their medical care virtually in 2020. 
I am proud to see my bill, the Pro-
tecting Mental Health Services Act, in-
cluded in this legislation to ensure sen-
iors have virtual access to mental 
health and substance abuse treatment. 
My bill ensures all Oklahomans can ac-
cess high-quality care, regardless of 
their physical location. 
While this legislation is a step for-
ward, it is unfortunate that it excludes 
employer-sponsored 
healthcare 
from 
the same low-cost access to telehealth. 
It is critical to provide folks on the job 
with the ability to seek flexible treat-
ment, and I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to pass this provision at a later 
date. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Advancing Tele-
health Beyond COVID–19 Act, which 
would extend vital telehealth flexibili-
ties through 2024. Expanding telehealth 
during the pandemic was a resounding 
success and has been recognized by 
many New Mexicans and rural Ameri-
cans as a lifesaver. 
Telehealth provided Americans con-
tinued access to healthcare services 
without being physically present and 
also allowed healthcare providers to re-
main in practice. 
While this bill is an important step 
in the right direction, my Republican 
colleagues and I wish to go one step 
further by offering another bill, which 
would make permanent the extension 
of telehealth services for federally 
qualified 
health 
clinics 
and 
rural 
health clinics. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill on the floor, 
as well as our subsequent bill to perma-
nently expand telehealth services to all 
Americans, regardless of ZIP Code. Ac-
cess to the care they deserve is crucial. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. STEEL). 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Advancing Telehealth 
Beyond COVID–19 Act. 
Telehealth has been life changing for 
so many, especially during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Increased access to tele-
health has benefited a wide range of 
Americans, from seniors to high-risk 
patients. 
We must ensure that the millions of 
Americans who have utilized flexibility 
provisions authorized during the pan-
demic do not lose their access to tele-
medicine. 
Right now, regardless of where you 
live, you have access to telehealth and 
virtual care. This bill ensures that this 
can continue for millions of Ameri-
cans, but we should ensure that this 
flexibility is permanent.

That is why I introduced legislation 
with Mr. BUCHANAN and Mr. JOHNSON to 
permanently remove any geographic 
restrictions on telehealth services. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support our legislation and 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on today’s bill so that we 
can continue to expand access to qual-
ity, affordable healthcare solutions. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
represent one of the largest geographic 
districts in the country. Access to 
healthcare is a very real problem for 
the people I represent because many of 
them live hours away and hundreds of 
miles 
away 
from 
specialized 
healthcare. 
For my constituents, one of the few 
positive developments that came out of 
COVID–19 was the expansion of the way 
that telehealth can be used to provide 
quality healthcare in districts like 
mine. 
This bill, H.R. 4040, would take a very 
meaningful step in making permanent 
the changes to law that enable the pro-
vision of that telehealth, and I strong-
ly urge its adoption. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT). 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
you hear everyone here all say some-
thing nice. We all like telehealth. I am 
frustrated because I can’t get my head 
around why we are not going further. 
Outside the internal political the-
ater, those of us who have worked on 
this legislation since the day we got 
here and then all of a sudden wake up 
one day and it is a different bill with 
someone who I have never even heard 
of working on it, God bless. The major-
ity gets to do things like that. 
We want a change in the price of 
healthcare. Can we come together and 
unleash 
technology? 
Telehealth 
is 
more than just looking at the phone 
and doing FaceTime or now talking. It 
is the wearable. It is the thing. It is the 
thing you lick. 
There is technology with which we 
could 
be 
crushing 
the 
price 
of 
healthcare, and instead, we are doing 
little incremental steps here. 
There are a couple of problems with 
the bill the Democrats decided to bring 
to the floor. It is for 2 years. We com-
promised to 4. If you want capital in-
vestments in the technology, you have 
to give us at least 4. It should be per-
manent. 
There is also something in here that 
is just frustrating. You missed the lan-
guage on health savings accounts. You 
have 32 million people now who func-
tionally are not going to have access to 
be able to use those accounts for their 
telehealth. 
Madam Speaker, there is just a frus-
tration here because we all talk pretty 
about this, and then we are unwilling 
to do the things that could potentially 
help us all by disrupting the price of 
healthcare 
and 
increasing 
access, 
maybe making people’s lives better. In-
stead, it just became more political 
theater. We should be ashamed of our-
selves. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
if I came to the body and said the bill 
we had all been working on, H.R. 8489— 
when you have someone like LLOYD 
DOGGETT and someone like me, and we 
are actually working together, we are 
working on some of the antifraud pro-
visions, program integrity provisions, 
you actually had something this body 
was doing where we weren’t beating 
the crap out of each other. It was 
something that actually might be good 
for people in the country. Instead, we 
turned it back into another oppor-
tunity for political gamesmanship. 
It is my intense disappointment be-
cause it is our language, substantially 
something I have worked on for years, 
that was grabbed for the pandemic. We 
all know it expires the day the pan-
demic is declared over. It is time to 
take this opportunity—I know there is 
an army of lobbyists out there that de-
spise telehealth because it changes the 
populations that walk in the threshold. 
To hell with them. Let’s finally do 
what is right. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I think we have had a good discussion 
here today. I think we have laid out 
that we are acting in good faith, sup-
porting an issue, moving it forward, 
but also posing the scenario that there 
are so many other things we can do to 
address the very matter that we are 
taking up here today. 
The surrounding details about how 
this bill came up and everything, I 
think it is problematic for the institu-
tion. But the fact of the matter is, we 
have an issue here that we need to ad-
dress. I hope that we can work to con-
tinue to make it permanent in the fu-
ture so that we can encourage invest-
ment, as was outlined previously, and 
encourage bending of the cost curve, 
ultimately, on healthcare, which is 
lacking at this point in time. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this bill, and I urge a different kind 
of cooperation moving forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Since I heard every Republican who 
spoke say that they support the bill, I 
was certainly reluctant to suggest that 
we would have any kind of significant 
debate about the bill. I generally feel 
that if I have both sides of the aisle 
saying it is a good bill, I should leave 
well enough alone. 
But I do want to say this in response 
to some of the comments that were 
made by the Republican Members. We 
were reluctant in the committee to 
move to have permanent authorization 
of the telehealth flexibility expansion 
for several reasons. 
First of all, it is expensive. In other 
words, the Congressional Budget Office 
scored this bill. As I said, the bill for 
the 2 years is paid for. If you wanted to 
go permanent, I think they would have 
said that we needed another $20 billion. 
I feel very strongly that the bill should 
be paid for. That is part of what we be-
lieve as Democrats. We were able to get 
agreement with the Republicans on a 
pay-for for the 2 years, so that was a 
factor as to why it is for 2 years in-
stead of permanent. 
Beyond that, and more importantly, 
really, is the fact that a permanent ex-
pansion is a major change. I think it 
needs a lot of study, a lot of oversight 
and investigation. One of the things 
that I mentioned in Rules is that both 
HHS and the inspector general have 
been tasked to report back to us this 
spring with a report on a lot of the 
things that were mentioned here today, 
integrity issues, in terms of fraud and 
abuse, that were mentioned by both 
sides of the aisle. 
I think the feeling of the committee 
was that this was something that need-
ed more study before we went ahead 
and made this permanent. That is what 
we do. In other words, right now, the 
concern is that because the omnibus 
appropriations bill basically expanded 
the telehealth program until 5 months 
after the public health emergency for 
COVID ends, that would take us to the 
end of this year. But we don’t have a 
lot of legislative days left. We figured 
the best thing was to at least extend it 
for another 2 years. We can pay for it, 
as was mentioned by Ms. CHENEY. 
This, I think, is the best way to re-
solve this: Do a 2-year extend, pay for 
it, and let’s spend the time between 
now and next spring having some more 
hearings and opportunities to talk 
about a further extension or possibly 
making it permanent. 
Again, I appreciate the fact that ev-
eryone on the Republican side supports 
the bill, but I do want to address some 
of the things that you mentioned. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4040 the Advancing Tele-
health Beyond COVID–19 Act of 2021, which 
would make permanent several telehealth 
flexibilities under Medicare that were initially 
authorized during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency. 
This bill would extend the life-saving meas-
ures put in place by Congress during the

July 27, 2022 
COVID–19 pandemic that allowed millions of 
American people to access telehealth-care. 
Specifically, H.R. 4040 would: 
permanently remove originating site and 
geographical restrictions that limited telehealth 
services to designated clinics in the event of 
a physician shortage, 
give rural providers the ability to serve pa-
tients remotely while being properly com-
pensated for their work, 
empower providers to provide access to 
smart devices and innovative digital tech-
nology to their patients for monitoring pur-
poses, and 
provide coverage for audio-only evaluation, 
management, and behavioral health services. 
H.R. 4040 would codify critical telehealth 
policies implemented during the pandemic for 
the continued benefit of all, but especially 
those in isolated communities, people with dis-
abilities, and seniors. 
Telehealth has dramatically improved the 
medical industry by making healthcare more 
accessible to people in rural areas, those with 
mobility concerns, and individuals whose work 
or family schedules may not accommodate an 
appointment at a physical location. 
During the height of the pandemic, while 
more than 3,000 people were dying per day of 
the virus, telehealth served as an invaluable 
weapon against the spread of infectious dis-
ease. 
Remote screening and care prevented 
undue burden on our already exhausted med-
ical professionals and allowed patients to get 
the care they needed without putting them-
selves or their families at risk. 
What began as emergency protocol then, 
has now emerged as best practice. 
Currently, 76 percent of hospitals in the U.S. 
connect doctors and patients remotely via tele-
health. 
This is up from 35 percent a decade ago. 
Remote healthcare allows for greater flexi-
bility for patients, enables certain physicians 
like allergists or occupational therapists to ac-
cess an individual’s environmental needs, and 
streamlines the scheduling process to prevent 
long wait times and wasted time. 
Telehealth has allowed doctors to monitor 
their patients’ chronic conditions more closely, 
like heart or lung disease. 
Better monitoring can improve patients’ 
quality-of life and reduce hospital admissions 
and deaths from chronic diseases. 
Additionally, telehealth is a good way to de-
liver care quickly in an emergency, such as a 
stroke or heart attack. 
Telehealth has also played a significant role 
in expanding pediatric mental healthcare ac-
cess. 
As of April 2019, there were only 8,300 
practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists in 
the U.S. 
This number is dwarfed by the more than 15 
million kids and teens in need of a psychiatric 
provider. 
For over a decade, The University of Texas 
Medical Branch has offered telehealth services 
for rural patients. 
After initially partnering with community 
mental health clinics in fringe counties, the 
program has since been able to expand ado-
lescent mental health services directly to 
school districts. 
This means children without access to a 
local psychiatrist can receive the care they 
need without being pulled from school or trav-
eling long distances. 
It also means psychiatrists can observe chil-
dren in their natural setting at home or in 
school, rather than in an inorganic hospital en-
vironment. 
Telehealth allows children to be where they 
ought to be—in the classroom getting an edu-
cation. 
These are just some of the many examples 
of how telehealth has aided our healthcare 
system in providing the quality medical serv-
ices that our constituents deserve. 
The passage of H.R. 4040, the Advancing 
Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 Act of 2021, 
would ensure that these positive develop-
ments continue to benefit communities across 
the country. 
It is important to note, however, that tele-
health has not always served all people equal-
ly. 
Historical data shows that People of Color 
have long faced obstacles to getting the crit-
ical health care services they need. 
Unfortunately, the rapid implementation of 
telemedicine hasn’t bridged the equality divide 
as much as one would have hoped. 
A study led by the University of Houston 
College of Medicine found that African Ameri-
cans were 35 percent less likely to use tele-
medicine compared to White Americans, and 
those in Hispanic communities were 51 per-
cent less likely to use it. 
Only 66 percent of African American and 61 
percent of Hispanic households have access 
to broadband internet compared to 79 percent 
of white households. 
Additionally, only a quarter of families earn-
ing $30,000 or less have smart devices, such 
as a phone, tablet, or laptop at home, limiting 
their access to telehealth services. 
So, while telehealth has reduced many bar-
riers to adequate healthcare, we must stay 
vigilant to the needs of our most disadvan-
taged community members. 
We are a long way from full medical equality 
in this country, however, I believe that the Ad-
vancing Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 Act of 
2021 is an important step in bringing us closer 
to that goal. 
H.R. 4040 is an opportunity to connect our 
healthcare providers with patients who might 
otherwise go without the medical care they so 
desperately need. 
It is an opportunity to lift our nation’s 
healthcare into the 21st century and to utilize 
technology as a medical equalizer. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
4040 
the 
Advancing 
Telehealth 
Beyond 
COVID–19 Act of 2021. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, as the Chair-
woman of the Health Subcommittee and a 
senior member of the Communications and 
Technology Subcommittee, I’ve advanced the 
importance of telehealth for years. 
Over the last several months, as I’ve talked 
to health care professionals and providers in 
my district, I’ve heard how the wide adoption 
of telehealth has been the bright spot during 
the pandemic. 
One reason for that bright spot is that HHS 
waived many rules and payment policies sur-
rounding telehealth coverage in traditional 
Medicare during the public health emergency. 
A recent HHS Office of the Inspector General 
report found that over 28 million Medicare 
beneficiaries used telehealth during the first 
year of the pandemic, demonstrating the long- 
term potential of telehealth to increase access 
to health care for beneficiaries. 
Now that beneficiaries have received this 
important benefit, they fully appreciate what 
telehealth does for them. We must find a way 
to continue telehealth access for seniors and 
all Americans. That’s why I’m proud to support 
Representatives LIZ CHENEY and DEBBIE DIN-
GELL’s bipartisan H.R. 4040, the ‘‘Advancing 
Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 Act of 2022.’’ 
The bill will allow Medicare beneficiaries to 
use telehealth services after the public health 
emergency ends by eliminating geographical 
restrictions on Medicare coverage for tele-
health services and expand Medicare cov-
erage to include audio-only telehealth. I urge 
my colleagues to support this important, bipar-
tisan bill. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legisla-
tion. 
I have been working on telehealth and tele-
medicine for nearly three decades, since my 
time in the California State Senate. 
As founder and Co-Chair of the Congres-
sional Telehealth Caucus, I have repeatedly 
introduced multiple bipartisan bills expanding 
access to telehealth, and have worked with 
my colleagues on the caucus—including Ms. 
Matsui, Mr. Welch, Mr. Schweikert, and Mr. 
Johnson of Ohio—to ensure that access to 
telehealth services does not disappear at the 
conclusion of the COVID–19 Public Health 
Emergency. 
I was proud to author legislation two years 
ago expanding telehealth in Medicare for the 
duration of the COVID–19 pandemic. That leg-
islation—which was included in the very first 
COVID–19 relief measure advanced by Con-
gress—has allowed millions of seniors on 
Medicare to see their doctors over the past 
two years without leaving their homes. 
By allowing these patients to receive the 
care they need remotely, we’ve been able to 
minimize transmission risk while maximizing 
safety for both patients and providers. 
In my view, the expansion and widespread 
adoption of telehealth services is one of the 
few silver linings of COVID–19. 
Americans across our country now know 
firsthand that by integrating technology with 
health care, we can bring care to underserved 
areas, reduce burdens on parents and care-
givers, increase the efficiency of our health 
care system and, in many cases, save money: 
by ensuring that patients receive care swiftly, 
we can treat medical conditions early on— 
thereby warding off worse (and more expen-
sive) complications down the road. 
However, while the value of telehealth is 
particularly evident amidst a pandemic, its util-
ity is not limited to the present circumstances. 
It is critical that Congress extend telehealth 
flexibilities in Medicare beyond the COVID–19 
public health emergency. 
And that’s what this bill does. 
This bill includes numerous provisions of 
mine ensuring that seniors can continue to 
visit providers remotely, regardless of zip 
code, for two more years. It allows us to con-
tinue amassing and analyzing data, and sets 
the stage for telehealth to become a perma-
nent part of the Medicare program—a goal 
I’ve long sought. 
I want to thank the many, many colleagues 
of mine who have worked with me on this crit-
ical issue. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired.

a notary public to meet a requirement under sec-
tion 3 or 4 in the performance of a notarization, 
or the failure of a notarization to conform to a 
requirement under section 3 or 4, shall not in-
validate or impair the validity or recognition of 
the notarization. 
(b) RIGHTS OF AGGRIEVED PERSONS.—The va-
lidity and recognition of a notarization under 
this Act may not be construed to prevent an ag-
grieved person from seeking to invalidate a 
record or transaction that is the subject of a no-
tarization or from seeking other remedies based 
on State or Federal law other than this Act for 
any reason not specified in this Act, including 
on the basis— 
(1) that a person did not, with present intent 
to authenticate or adopt a record, execute a sig-
nature on the record; 
(2) that an individual was incompetent, 
lacked authority or capacity to authenticate or 
adopt a record, or did not knowingly and volun-
tarily authenticate or adopt a record; or 
(3) of fraud, forgery, mistake, misrepresenta-
tion, impersonation, duress, undue influence, or 
other invalidating cause. 
(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
Act may be construed to affect a State law gov-
erning, authorizing, or prohibiting the practice 
of law. 
SEC. 9. EXCEPTION TO PREEMPTION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—A State law may modify, 
limit, or supersede the provisions of section 3, or 
subsection (a) or (b) of section 4, with respect to 
State law only if that State law— 
(1) either— 
(A) constitutes an enactment or adoption of 
the Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, as 
approved and recommended for enactment in all 
the States by the National Conference of Com-
missioners on Uniform State Laws in 2018 or the 
Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, as ap-
proved and recommended for enactment in all 
the States by the National Conference of Com-
missioners on Uniform State Laws in 2021, ex-
cept that a modification to such Law enacted or 
adopted by a State shall be preempted to the ex-
tent such modification— 
(i) is inconsistent with a provision of section 
3 or subsection (a) or (b) of section 4, as applica-
ble; or 
(ii) would not be permitted under subpara-
graph (B); or 
(B) specifies additional or alternative proce-
dures or requirements for the performance of 
notarizations with respect to electronic records 
or for remotely located individuals, if those ad-
ditional or alternative procedures or require-
ments— 
(i) are consistent with section 3 and sub-
sections (a) and (b) of section 4; and 
(ii) do not accord greater legal effect to the 
implementation or application of a specific tech-
nology or technical specification for performing 
those notarizations; and 
(2) requires the retention of an audio and vis-
ual recording of the performance of a notariza-
tion for a remotely located individual for a pe-
riod of not less than 5 years after the recording 
is created. 
(b) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in sec-
tion 5 or 6 may be construed to preclude the rec-
ognition of a notarization under applicable 
State law, regardless of whether such State law 
is consistent with section 5 or 6. 
SEC. 10. STANDARD OF CARE; SPECIAL NOTARIAL 
COMMISSIONS. 
(a) STATE STANDARDS OF CARE; AUTHORITY OF 
STATE REGULATORY OFFICIALS.—Nothing in this 
Act may be construed to prevent a State, or a 
notarial regulatory official of a State, from— 
(1) adopting a requirement in this Act as a 
duty or standard of care under the laws of that 
State or sanctioning a notary public for breach 
of such a duty or standard of care;

tions for, or denying, refusing to renew, revok-
ing, suspending, or imposing a condition on, a 
commission or appointment as a notary public;

viduals; or

forming a notarization under section 3 or 4 as a

care or for official misconduct. 
(b) SPECIAL COMMISSIONS OR AUTHORIZATIONS 
CREATED BY A STATE; SANCTION FOR BREACH OR 
OFFICIAL MISCONDUCT.—A notary public may 
not perform a notarization under section 3 or 4 
if— 
(1)(A) the notary public’s State has enacted a 
law that creates or designates a class or type of 
commission or appointment, or requires an en-
dorsement or other authorization to be received 
by a notary public, as a condition on the au-
thority to perform notarizations with respect to 
electronic records or for remotely located indi-
viduals; and 
(B) the commission or appointment of the no-
tary public is not of the class or type or the no-
tary public has not received the endorsement or 
other authorization; or

tary public’s State has prohibited the notary 
public from performing the notarization as a 
sanction for a breach of duty or standard of 
care or for official misconduct.

of such provision to any person or circumstance 
is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the re-
mainder of this Act and the application of the

in place of the prior version, unless, within 90 
days after receiving the notice, the Commission 
notifies the organization that the revised vol-

improve the safety of the consumer product cov-

Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cost-Share

SAFE CONNECTIONS ACT OF 2022 
H.R. 7132 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Connec-
tions Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, 
terms used in this Act that are defined in 
section 345(a) of the Communications Act of 
1934, as added by section 4 of this Act, have 
the meanings given those terms in such sec-
tion 345(a). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Domestic violence, dating violence, 
stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, 
and 
related 
crimes 
are 
life-threatening 
issues and have lasting and harmful effects 
on individuals, families, and entire commu-
nities. 
(2) Survivors often lack meaningful sup-
port and options when establishing independ-
ence from an abuser, including barriers such 
as financial insecurity and limited access to 
reliable communications tools to maintain 
essential connections with family, social 
safety networks, employers, and support 
services. 
(3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse de-
scribed in paragraph (1) increasingly use 
technological and communications tools to 
exercise control over, monitor, and abuse 
their victims. 
(4) Communications law can play a public 
interest role in the promotion of safety, life, 
and property with respect to the types of vi-
olence and abuse described in paragraph (1). 
For example, independent access to a wire-
less phone plan can assist survivors in estab-
lishing security and autonomy. 
(5) 
Safeguards 
within 
communications 
services can serve a role in preventing abuse 
and narrowing the digital divide experienced 
by survivors of abuse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7213 
July 27, 2022 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6929, the Susan 
Muffley Act of 2022, will restore the 
hard-earned pensions of more than 
20,000 Delphi salaried retirees, includ-
ing 5,000 in my home State of Michi-
gan. 
The Susan Muffley Act is a bipar-
tisan bill supported by Republicans and 
Democrats in both the House and the 
Senate. I worked most particularly 
with Mr. RYAN of Ohio and Mr. TURNER 
of Ohio on this legislation along with 
the other cosponsors. It is endorsed by 
the AARP, the AFL–CIO, and the UAW. 
I am glad we can come together finally 
to do what is right for these workers. 
These are workers who lost their pen-
sions through no fault of their own. 
In this country, Madam Speaker, if 
you work hard and play by the rules, 
you should be able to retire with dig-
nity and with peace of mind. Instead, 
these workers had the rug ripped out 
from underneath them and lost their 
hard-earned benefits. When General 
Motors filed for bankruptcy during the 
Great Recession the Federal Govern-
ment—I repeat, the Federal Govern-
ment—made the unprecedented step to 
move in and save the auto industry. At 
the direction of the Federal Govern-
ment, however, the U.S. Pension Ben-
efit Guaranty Corporation, the PBGC, 
assumed responsibility for the Delphi 
salaried retiree pensions. After nego-
tiations with the Federal Government, 
the PBGC cut those hard-earned bene-
fits by as much as 70 percent for 20,000 
Delphi salaried retirees. 
These 
retirees 
were 
treated 
dif-
ferently than other retirees impacted 
by the GM bankruptcy. They suffered 
significant cuts to their benefits, up-
ending the lives of thousands and thou-
sands of families. 
In September of 2019, the Delphi Sal-
aried Retirees Association filed suit 
against the PBGC to have their pension 
benefits restored. It went all the way 
to the Supreme Court until the Court 
declined to hear the case, making it 
clear that only congressional action 
could restore these earned pension ben-
efits. 
Our legislation would make this 
unique group of retirees who had their 
pensions unfairly and disproportion-
ately cut will make them whole again. 
This means that beneficiaries will re-
ceive a payment of the difference of 
what was actually paid to them by the 
PBGC and what they would have 
earned had they been able to keep their 
pensions like everyone else did. Moving 
forward, beneficiaries will receive their 
full earned pension. 
This bill is fully paid for and will not 
add to the deficit. 
Delphi salaried retirees deserve to 
have their pensions made whole be-
cause it was the Federal Government 
that singled these workers out. It was 
the Federal Government who stepped 
in to rescue General Motors but de-
cided to treat these workers differently 
and cut their earned pensions. It was 
the Federal Government, not General 
Motors, who directly negotiated with 
the PBGC. 
What happened to these hardworking 
retirees was wrong, and now it is the 
Federal Government who has the re-
sponsibility to fix the mess that itself 
created. 
We need to get this legislation done 
for people like Susan Muffley for whom 
this bill is named. David Muffley, Su-
san’s husband, worked at Delphi as an 
electronics technician for 31 years but 
lost the full value of his pension in 
2009. His wife, Susan Muffley, was a 
core part of the Delphi Salaried Retir-
ees 
Association’s 
leadership 
team 
fighting to restore these pensions. 
Because of the financial difficulties 
of losing their pension, Susan avoided 
seeing her doctor because they couldn’t 
afford it. Sadly, she was ultimately di-
agnosed with pancreatic cancer and 
passed away. 
After working hard for 30 years to 
earn a pension to support your family 
through retirement, no worker and no 
family member should be forced to 
forgo medical treatment to make ends 
meet. These workers need the Susan 
Muffley Act. The last 13 years have 
been an absolute nightmare for these 
families. These are people I know. 
During the Obama Administration, 
the problem was created but never ad-
dressed. During the Trump administra-
tion, the former President talked about 
fixing the issue but never acted. He ran 
out of time before that moment could 
occur. But now, today, after lots of 
talk and not so much action, Congress 
can finally act to provide relief and 
justice for these workers, these Delphi 
salaried retirees. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, when it comes to 
bailouts, Congress just can’t seem to 
help itself. Under President Biden, tax-
payers have been forced to bankroll the 
so-called American Rescue Plan which 
included an uncapped bailout for fail-
ing and insolvent multi-employer pen-
sions. 
From footing the bill for this exces-
sive government spending to record- 
high gas prices, taxpayers can’t catch a 
break in Biden’s America, and today 
we are considering another bailout 
that will force taxpayers to cover the 
tab for failed, privately run pensions. 
What message does this send to the 
men and women who have their own re-
tirement accounts to worry about or 
have no retirement accounts at all? 
More pension bailouts set a damning 
precedent. In case anyone has forgot-
ten, we work for hardworking tax-
payers in this country. As Members of 
Congress we have an obligation to en-
sure that taxpayer dollars are being 
spent as efficiently and effectively as 
possible. Unfortunately, too many ig-
nore this important duty and are 
happy to mortgage the future of the 
next generation with reckless spend-
ing. 
On top of the price tag, there have 
been no hearings and no markups on 
H.R. 6929. 
Is this the standard the House wants 
to operate under—one where any piece 
of legislation can be fast-tracked to 
the floor without due consideration 
and scrutiny? 
Under Democrat control, good gov-
ernance has long been abandoned in the 
people’s House. 
In 2009, when Delphi Corporation 
completed its 4-year bankruptcy, its 
defined benefit pension plans were ter-
minated and taken over by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, 
a process that has been well-estab-
lished. At that time, the Delphi pen-
sion plans were collectively under-
funded by $7.2 billion. Delphi did not 
make required contributions to its pen-
sion plans in the 4 years it was moving 
through bankruptcy. The salaried em-
ployee plan, in particular, was only 48 
percent funded with $2.4 billion in as-
sets and liabilities of $5 billion. 
Fast forward to today, and we are 
considering a bill that would dole out 
money like candy. Under this bill, par-
ticipants would receive a retroactive 
lump-sum payment, or ‘‘top-up,’’ of the 
difference between what was paid by 
PBGC and what the plans would have 
paid had they not been terminated. 
But here is the kicker, Madam 
Speaker: this top-up would come with 
an additional 6 percent interest, and all 
participants would receive their origi-
nal monthly benefits moving forward. 
Let’s turn our attention to the prece-
dent that this bill sets for the entire 
single-employer pension system. Cur-
rently, PBGC’s single-employer insur-
ance program is funded exclusively by 
premiums paid by employer plan spon-
sors and does not—does not—receive 
taxpayer dollars. PBGC is the trustee 
of over 5,000 terminated single-em-
ployer plans. 
Madam Speaker, please pay attention 
to this next part. By topping up one 
plan, Congress will be pressured and ex-
pected to top up the remaining 5,000 
terminated plans and every future ter-
minated plan. 
How many plans does PBGC cur-
rently insure? 
More than 23,000 active, single-em-
ployer plans are currently insured. 
So, Madam Speaker, what is next on 
the docket? 
Should Congress roll up its sleeves 
and make whole every American’s 
401(k) plan that took a few hits? 
Again, how about Americans who do 
not have a pension plan? 
There are many of those. Imagine the 
harebrained schemes that Congress 
could start pulling out of its hat if 
given this encouragement. We should 
be protecting taxpayers, not feeding 
them to the wolves. 
This bill is a slap in the face to fiscal 
responsibility. H.R. 6929’s cash give-
away will force taxpayers to shoulder a

cost of $800 million over the next dec-
ade and $1.3 billion in all to bail out 
underfunded, 
privately 
run 
pension 
plans. 
Another bailout of failing pension 
plans does nothing but stick it to hard-
working taxpayers. This bill simply un-
derscores the fact that Congress is too 
misguided to focus on real issues. 
Madam Speaker, hardworking tax-
payers cannot afford more senseless 
bailouts. Enough is enough. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of my colleague. I disagree 
with the conclusions that she makes, 
and I would only challenge a couple of 
things. 
One is on the issue of precedent. 
There is no precedent, unless the prece-
dent is when the Federal Government 
intervenes and takes control of a com-
pany, takes ownership of a company, it 
buys the problem. It then owns the so-
lution. It owns responsibility for the 
solution. 
So the only precedent that I think 
this sets is one that I learned a long 
time ago: if you broke it, you bought 
it. The Federal Government intervened 
and made these decisions dispropor-
tionately affecting these particular 
employees. 
The rest of the employees got their 
pensions topped up, why wouldn’t this 
particular set? 
Secondly, I disagree with the ref-
erence that this is candy. For these 
taxpayers, these families, this is rent, 
this is food on the table, it is their 
mortgage payment, it is a car pay-
ment, and it is medicine—medicines 
that, sadly, Susan Muffley didn’t have 
the ability to get to because her pen-
sion was cut. This is about justice. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
LAWRENCE), 
who 
unfortunately 
is 
spending her last months in Congress. I 
wish that weren’t the case. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Susan 
Muffley Act. This bill would restore 
pension benefits to over 20,000 Delphi 
salaried retirees, including over 5,000 
Michiganders. 
When GM filed for bankruptcy during 
the Great Recession, these families lost 
up to 70 percent of their earned bene-
fits. They need and deserve the atten-
tion and action of this body. 
This 
bill 
is 
named 
after 
Susan 
Muffley, whose husband worked at Del-
phi for 31 years and could not seek 
medical treatment when their family 
lost the pension. 
Mrs. Muffley spent years fighting to 
have all these pensions restored. 
Let 
me 
be 
absolutely 
clear: 
Michiganders and all Americans who 
have worked hard their entire lives to 
support their families deserve the right 
to retire with dignity and financial se-
curity. This is simply the right thing 
to do. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Congressman KILDEE, for intro-
ducing this bipartisan bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ In Amer-
ica we are better than this, and we 
need to pass this bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member, Dr. Foxx, 
of North Carolina for yielding. 
Unlike the multi-employer pension 
program, which was recently injected 
with billions of taxpayer dollars, the 
single-employer insurance program is 
self-sufficient. It is funded by pre-
miums paid by employer sponsors to 
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpora-
tion. By most accounts, PBGC’s single- 
employer insurance system is healthy 
and not in need of bailouts. Yet a bail-
out is exactly what H.R. 6929 is. You 
cannot give public money out to one 
person without first taking it from an-
other. 
This bill does not help Pennsylva-
nians without a pension plan or with 
losses in their personal retirement ac-
counts. On the contrary, this bill is an 
irresponsible giveaway that sets a dan-
gerous precedent for the Federal Gov-
ernment’s 
involvement 
in 
pension 
plans going forward. 
b 1600 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that this bailout will cost tax-
payers nearly $800 million over 10 
years; not including the lifetime cost 
of the bill, which could reach $1.3 bil-
lion. I wonder how the people that have 
to pay that in the next generation are 
going to pay their rent, afford their 
college, and afford their groceries. 
Congressional Democrats and the 
Biden 
administration 
have 
already 
spent tens of billions on insolvent and 
failing multi-employer plans, without 
holding trustees accountable for failing 
workers or retirees, or meaningfully 
reforming the pension system to pre-
vent future insolvency. 
Once again, the Federal Government 
is offering a pension bailout. 
Hardworking taxpayers who have 
their own retirements to worry about 
cannot continue to shoulder this bur-
den. We cannot set this kind of prece-
dent for a single-employer system. If 
Congress gives special treatment to 
this plan covered by today’s bill, the 
other 5,000 single-employer plans also 
managed by PBGC will pressure Con-
gress to do the same for all. 
Is Congress then expected to top up 
or provide a lump sum to every future 
terminated plan? These are serious im-
plications that cannot be ignored. 
The vast majority of participants in 
terminated plans receive their full ben-
efits. The Delphi plans are no excep-
tion. Nearly three-fourths of partici-
pants were not subject to the PBGC’s 
statutory guarantee limits. 
This body must remember it works 
for the taxpayers, not political interest 
groups. Americans don’t work hard 
each and every day to fund irrespon-
sible pet projects. We need more fiscal 
sanity, not more pension bailouts. 
On top of all these issues, the man-
ager’s amendment is simply a budget 
gimmick to make the bill appear to 
cost nothing. 
In reality, it accelerates the time pe-
riod in which single-employer plans are 
required to pay their variable rate pre-
miums to the PBGC to fit within the 
budget window, and it adds nothing to 
the PBGC’s bottom line. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. KELLER. PBGC is going to re-
ceive the same amount of money with 
or without the manager’s amendment. 
I encourage my colleagues to oppose 
this legislation and the dangerous, fis-
cally irresponsible precedent it sets. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS), my colleague on 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. I rise 
today in support of H.R. 6929, the Susan 
Muffley Act. 
Madam Speaker, this House has been 
one of the strongest advocates for 
workers and worker families in recent 
history. 
We passed legislation to increase the 
minimum wage; to support the right to 
organize; to decrease the cost of drugs 
and health insurance. And we protected 
and restored pensions. But as this bill 
shows, our work is not complete. 
My community in Buffalo and West-
ern New York has a long history of 
auto-making. When the recession hit in 
2009, families across my district saw 
their pensions evaporate. 
And while we stabilized the auto sec-
tor, and the loans have been repaid, 
thousands of former auto company em-
ployees have been left behind, includ-
ing hundreds of Delphi workers in 
Lockport who, due to no fault of their 
own, had their pensions arbitrarily cut. 
This legislation will fix that long-
standing error and will provide cer-
tainty so that these families can retire 
with the benefits they earned. 
I thank Mr. KILDEE from Michigan, 
Mr. RYAN and Mr. TURNER from Ohio, 
for being champions of this bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to support its pas-
sage. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in strong opposition to 
H.R. 6929, another Democrat bailout 
bill by the sponsors of the nanny state. 
It is clear that ‘‘Bidenflation’’ is 
crushing the American people with the 
Biden price hike that is causing sky- 
high gas prices, and Americans are 
struggling to stay afloat as the econ-
omy limps toward recession. 
Not surprisingly though, Democrats 
are trying to redefine the term ‘‘reces-
sion’’ to avoid recognizing the failures 
of their damaging policies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7215 
July 27, 2022 
Let me help them out by quoting, 
paraphrasing from the former Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan: A recession is 
when your neighbor loses his job. A de-
pression is when you lose your job. But 
a recovery is when Democrat Members 
of Congress lose their jobs. 
This legislation would make hard-
working middle-class taxpayers reim-
burse pension plan participants who 
were employed by the now-defunct Del-
phi Corporation and add 6 percent in-
terest. The Democrats insist that this 
is just an attempt to rightfully recover 
losses suffered by these former employ-
ees. 
But early in my own career, I actu-
ally experienced this kind of unfortu-
nate situation firsthand. In fact, my 
first employer after college ended their 
cash balance pension plan just a couple 
of years after I started with the com-
pany. But it never occurred to me that 
other hardworking taxpayers should 
have to pay me for the benefits and 
earnings that I missed out on. 
My next employer sold my division 
to a competitor, and then the former 
parent company went under, and the 
value of their stock that made up a sig-
nificant portion of my retirement ac-
count went to zero. But, again, it never 
occurred to me that other, hard-
working taxpayers should have to pay 
me to restore my lost investment 
value. 
In both cases, recognizing the risks 
and rewards associated with our non-
socialist, free enterprise economic sys-
tem, I just kept working hard, saving 
money for retirement, with no help 
from Congress or confiscation of re-
sources from other hardworking tax-
payers. 
To my benevolent colleagues on the 
other side, I have one question for you: 
Where does this end? And we know 
where it ends, with these policies car-
ried to its logical conclusion, with the 
physical ruin of America. 
But I should say benevolent with 
other people’s money and with our 
children’s financial and economic fu-
ture. 
Should 
Congress 
reimburse 
every 
American’s 
investment 
retirement 
plan when it suffers a loss? 
What if all Americans seek repay-
ment for their losses in this failed 
Biden economy, because it does affect 
everyone. 
But hardworking Americans have 
had enough. Why should the constitu-
ents of my Virginia Fifth District pay 
for someone else’s retirement plan? 
Enough with the stimulus checks; 
enough with the bailouts; enough with 
paying people not to work; enough 
with growing the welfare state; enough 
with incentivizing and rewarding the 
wrong behavior, while punishing those 
who do the right thing. 
Let’s get back to the Trump policies, 
1 percent inflation, $2 gas prices, and 
put Americans back to work. I urge all 
of my colleagues to vote against this 
Democrat bailout bill. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciated the gentleman’s com-
ments. I will point out, since the gen-
tleman did refer to the former Presi-
dent, Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump saw 
this as an injustice and directed his ad-
ministration to address it as well. 
And I also think there is enough par-
tisanship in Washington, more than 
enough, so let’s not make something 
that is bipartisan just for the point of 
rhetorical value into something that is 
claimed to be partisan. 
This is not a partisan piece of legisla-
tion. I see Mr. TURNER on the other 
side of the aisle. We have worked to-
gether on this for years; 17 of the 37 co-
sponsors of this legislation are Repub-
licans, including Members with whom I 
don’t think I have ever shared sponsor-
ship. I don’t recall, for example, being 
a cosponsor of any piece of legislation 
with Mr. MO BROOKS. We are on this 
one. 
This is not a partisan bill, so let’s not 
call it that. You can disagree with it. 
You can vote against people getting 
their hard-earned pensions, but let’s 
not make it into something that it 
isn’t. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL), a friend that I have known 
for a very long time, a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
6929, the Susan Muffley Act of 2022. 
Every worker deserves a secure and 
dignified retirement. That shouldn’t be 
negotiable, especially when they were 
promised a pension as part of their in-
come and put into it. 
This legislation restores the pension 
benefits of Delphi salaried retirees that 
were impacted by the Great Recession, 
some of whom saw their pensions cut 
by as much as 70 percent as a result of 
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpora-
tion’s termination of their benefits un-
fairly. 
My State of Michigan was particu-
larly impacted, as I know the State of 
Ohio was—it was a good midwest com-
pany—by the termination of these 
plans, with thousands of retirees losing 
pension benefits they earned, they were 
promised. They deserve the full value 
of what they earned and were prom-
ised. 
These retirees have been fighting for 
over a decade to receive these benefits, 
and it is time to make them whole. 
I strongly urge all of my colleagues 
to support this important bipartisan 
bill. 
I thank my colleague for his leader-
ship. When we are home, we listen to 
these people who are just in total 
tears. They don’t know what to do. And 
my colleague has never stopped leading 
the charge for them. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. TURNER). 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member FOXX for yield-
ing me time. 
I am an original cosponsor of this 
bill, H.R. 6929. This legislation restores 
the pensions of the Delphi Salaried Re-
tirees. 
I am very proud to speak on behalf of 
this bipartisan bill. During the Obama 
administration’s 2009 taxpayer-funded 
General Motors bankruptcy bailout, 
President Obama’s Auto Task Force di-
rected the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation to terminate the fully 
funded pensions of more than 20,000 
Delphi Automotive salaried retirees. 
Even worse is that the pensions of 
the salaried retirees were terminated 
while the Obama Auto Task Force used 
the taxpayer-funded bankruptcy to top 
up the pensions of the Delphi union 
employees. The Obama administration 
choose winners and losers, with tax-
payers’ dollars. 
A 2013 report published by the Spe-
cial Inspector General for TARP said: 
‘‘Treasury did not view the non-UAW 
Delphi hourly employees or the Delphi 
salaried employees as having leverage 
because they could not hold up GM’s 
bankruptcy.’’ 
These pensions did not fail. These 
pensioners were robbed of their pen-
sions by the people who were supposed 
to protect them. 
For over 13 years now, I have worked 
with my colleagues to try to restore 
these pensions. President Trump issued 
a 
Presidential 
directive, 
a 
memo-
randum directing the PBGC to provide 
options for restoring through the agen-
cy calling ‘‘the plight of Delphi’s sala-
ried and non-unionized workforce a 
great concern to my administration.’’ 
President Biden also supports this 
legislation. Now, Congress must re-
store these pensions. There is no prece-
dent for this bill. No one else has had 
the White House pick winners and los-
ers and take away their pensions. 
It is our responsibility, as Members 
of Congress, to address this injustice. 
We finally have the chance to rectify 
this wrong. Stand up for the 20,000 
hardworking 
Americans 
who 
want 
what is rightfully theirs. I ask my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. RYAN), a gentleman that I have 
been working with on this issue for as 
long as I have been in Congress. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, 13 years; 
13 years. I have been in Congress now 
for a little while, and I cannot begin to 
tell you what an example that the Del-
phi salaried retirees have set. It is the 
absolute gold standard for activism and 
lobbying their government. 
And I, you know, normally get up 
here and get pretty upset; but I have 
got to kind of laugh because when I 
hear our friends on the other side talk 
about irresponsibility and gimmicks 
and nanny states and socialists, I think 
of all my friends in the Delphi salaried 
retirement. 
These are the most hardworking citi-
zens that I have in my district. And 
they show up for work. They coach the 
baseball teams. They work at the 
church. They are veterans. They give 
back. They are great parents. They are

Our job here is pretty simple. We 
look at the field, see what is happening 
in the country, and if some person or 
group of people are being wronged un-
fairly, it is our job to fix it. It is not a 
Democrat thing. It is not a Republican 
thing. It is not a left-right thing, not a 
free market thing, or a socialist thing. 
It is about people. It is about Amer-
ican citizens who did everything right. 
They showed up one day in the middle 
of a bankruptcy that, as Mr. KILDEE 
has articulated here, the government 
was organizing, and reorganizing, the 
American auto industry. This isn’t 
some private-sector bankruptcy. The 
government was in there manipulating 
everything, and they screwed up. 
There was no one screaming louder 
than I was at the Obama administra-
tion, SHERROD BROWN and I, in meet-
ings with Tim Geithner and all the rest 
over the last 13 years. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. I thank Congressman KIL-
DEE from the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, Chairman of the Ways and 
Means 
Committee 
RICHIE
NEAL, 
SHERROD BROWN, ROB PORTMAN, MIKE 
TURNER. The Members of Congress and 
Senators who are on the ground with 
these families came together and have 
been fighting. 
Here we are, 13 years later, where we 
are going to vote this out of the House, 
and we are going to send it to the Sen-
ate. We are going to try to help people 
because that is our job. 
What I really appreciate about this is 
that during the rescue package, we 
were able to save hundreds and hun-
dreds of thousands of pensions for peo-
ple, about 100,000 in Ohio, because there 
was a problem, and we tried to fix it. 
That happened to be unions. 
This group happens to not be union, 
but they deserve help all the same. 
That is what we are doing here. I was 
proud that the Auto Workers and the 
AFL–CIO are helping to support this. 
We need more of this. I think this is 
an example of how to try to influence 
your government, try to get help, try 
to right a wrong, and not talk about 
Democrat and Republican and red and 
blue and all that nonsense that we are 
all sick of. 
We are ready to move forward. If you 
need help, if you have been wronged, 
we are going to stand up and fight for 
you. 
Again, I thank Mr. KILDEE for his 
leadership here. We are going to send 
this over to the Senate. 
I know there are a lot of people, 
again, living and working and talking 
to these families over the last 13 years. 
How many people have passed away? 
How many families have been harmed? 
How many other people have not got-
ten the healthcare that they needed be-
cause they couldn’t afford it, or they 
had situations in their family, and 
they 
didn’t 
have 
enough 
money, 
maybe, to help their kids or help their 
grandkids? 
This is the right thing to do. This is 
the absolute right thing to do. I am 
glad it is bipartisan, and I am glad we 
finally got it done after 13 years. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, my col-
leagues say we are here to help people. 
Our first job is like the doctor’s oath: 
First, do no harm. This bill does harm. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVID-
SON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my colleague, Congress-
woman FOXX, for yielding. We disagree 
from time to time, and this is one of 
those. 
I do agree that it shouldn’t be seen as 
a partisan issue. The Democrats may 
see this as precedent-setting in a way 
that Republicans who support it don’t. 
The precedent here isn’t that every vic-
tim of fraud, and there are many when 
it comes to pensions, is going to some-
how be made whole. Otherwise, you 
would create an incentive for people to 
commit fraud. One person takes the 
fall, and everyone else gets bailed out. 
That is not what this is. 
When I listen to my colleague, Con-
gressman BOB GOOD from Virginia, I 
might feel the same way if I didn’t un-
derstand the facts of this situation. 
What this really amounts to is pension 
holders who were effectively the vic-
tims of civil asset forfeiture, which is 
an unjust and, in my opinion, unconsti-
tutional practice that, sadly, is still 
tolerated. 
This wasn’t an underfunded pension. 
They weren’t victims of fraud. Their 
pension was funded, and the govern-
ment seized the assets. They seized 
what they said was the property of Del-
phi, a company in bankruptcy, but the 
reality is this is property of the pen-
sion holders. This is their retirement 
savings that was seized 13 years ago. 
Thankfully, when Vice President Joe 
Biden said there is nothing we can do, 
in the intervening years, we found a 
way. I want to say thanks to Congress-
man KILDEE from Michigan. I want to 
say thanks to my colleague, MIKE TUR-
NER. 
I was on Air Force One with him as 
we were flying from Andrews Air Force 
base to Dayton, Ohio. Congressman 
TURNER took the lead, shared the mes-
sage. We continued to work with Presi-
dent Trump at the time. He got it. He 
took action, and I think that this is 
one of the things where we have seen 
continuity. 
I wish it would become a trend and 
that President Biden would carry many 
more policies with continuation. I 
think we would see great results be-
cause we are going to see great results 
out of this. 
It sets the right precedent. I hope the 
precedent it sets is this government 
stops civil asset forfeiture altogether. 
It was unjust to do that to these pen-
sion holders, and I am glad that justice 
is finally going to come as a result of 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues, even those who thought 
they were opposed to it, once you un-
derstand what is really going on here, 
to get on board and support this just 
bill. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the longest-serving 
woman in the history of the United 
States Congress. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman KILDEE for yielding 
time. 
Madam Speaker, a miracle is hap-
pening here. Michigan Wolverines and 
Ohio Buckeyes, on a bipartisan basis, 
are agreeing. Wow. Everybody should 
vote for this act, for America’s sake. 
I am so proud to help celebrate the 
passage day of the Susan Muffley Act 
that will restore retirement benefits 
for thousands of Delphi retirees. Hard 
work should be rewarded. 
The men and women who built up 
Delphi were made a promise in return 
for their years of hard work, and they 
were promised a stable and secure re-
tirement during their golden years. 
Over the years, the American worker 
has time and again seen promises bro-
ken, and they have seen the financial 
security they earned and is rightfully 
theirs thrown away. Now, the Susan 
Muffley Act makes good on Delphi’s 
original promise. 
Workers in Defiance, Ohio, and San-
dusky, Ohio, and throughout Michigan 
and the Midwest will see, by restoring 
their benefits, the retirees who worked 
hard and built America will have the 
future they paid for and earned. 
We know that the Susan Muffley Act 
is a giant step forward in justice, jus-
tice for Americans who worked hard 
and were cast aside until now. 
I thank Congressman KILDEE for his 
absolutely tireless and relentless ef-
forts to bring this to the floor. To get 
anything out of the Ways and Means 
Committee is a miracle anyway. 
For Ohio, this means 5,000 families— 
believe me, many who can’t afford 
their medicine, many who worry about 
tomorrow—will be celebrating. There 
will be a sense of being made whole 
again because of what they gave to this 
country, what they gave to their em-
ployers, and that bargain should be 
kept. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Con-
gressman KILDEE. The Wolverine State 
has sent a highly capable American to 
Congress. I thank Congressman TUR-
NER
of the great Buckeye State of 
Ohio, from the Dayton region, for this 
great partnership to help thousands 
and thousands of America’s retirees. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing.

tlewoman from North Carolina has 13

minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Michigan has 121⁄2
minutes re-
maining. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, pro-
ponents of H.R. 6929 continue to cite 
the statistics that the salaried em-
ployee pension plan was 86 percent 
funded in 2009 and, therefore, should 
not have been terminated. This is mis-
leading and simply not the case. 
When the salaried employee plan was 
terminated in 2009, it was roughly 50 
percent funded with $2.4 billion in as-
sets and $5 billion in liabilities. Delphi 
had not made required contributions to 
the plan in the previous 4 years. 
Further, Delphi was moving through 
bankruptcy proceedings, and the com-
pany stated publicly it was unable to 
fund its pension plans before reaching 
an agreement with PBGC to terminate 
the plans. 
Delphi had not made required con-
tributions to the pension plans in the 4 
years 
it 
was 
in 
bankruptcy 
pro-
ceedings. Delphi was liquidating assets 
in bankruptcy, and the plan had only 
enough assets to pay for half of its ben-
efit obligations. 
Finally, if the Delphi salaried em-
ployee plan was truly as well funded as 
proponents suggest, then why did it not 
have enough assets to cover the bene-
fits owed to workers and retirees? 
Madam Speaker, this is a big problem 
for the taxpayers of this country when 
we start bailing out pension plans in 
this way. We have a process through 
the PBGC, and that process should be 
followed. 
Madam Speaker, it is important, 
really important, to make sure the 
Record is accurate. Most Delphi sala-
ried pension plan participants who are 
being discussed today either received 
no cuts in their pensions or saw cuts of 
less than 10 percent. 
PBGC typically becomes a trustee of 
a single-employer plan when the em-
ployer that sponsors the plan declares 
bankruptcy and the plan has insuffi-
cient assets from which to pay all 
promised benefits. When PBGC be-
comes a trustee of a single-employer 
pension plan, plan participants receive 
their full benefits up to a statutory 
maximum benefit, a benefit set by Con-
gress. 
The maximum guarantee in 2009, the 
year of Delphi’s bankruptcy, was $4,500 
per month or $54,000 per year for retir-
ees who began receiving benefits at age 
65. That is a very high amount of 
money that many Americans will never 
earn per year, let alone have for retire-
ment. 
PBGC reported in 2019 that 84 percent 
of retirees who receive benefits from 
PBGC are paid the full benefit amounts 
they earned under their retirement 
plans, meaning they do not have their 
benefits reduced. 
In the case of the Delphi salaried em-
ployee plan, 72 percent of participants 
were not affected by PBGC’s statutory 
benefit limit. Of the remaining 28 per-
cent, 36 percent saw less than a 10 per-
cent reduction. 
Madam Speaker, again, I am speak-
ing for the Americans who will never 
get a pension benefit because they have 
worked so hard but never made enough 
money to have a pension or don’t have 
employers that pay pension benefits. 
We are bailing out people who are mak-
ing a lot of money. 
Madam Speaker, wages aren’t keep-
ing up with inflation. A Washington 
Post 
economic 
columnist 
recently 
pointed out that workers are experi-
encing the biggest decline in years in 
inflation-adjusted pay. According to a 
new report, 75 percent of middle-in-
come families say their ‘‘income is fall-
ing behind the cost of living.’’ 
Given persistent and rising inflation, 
H.R. 6929 is the last thing we should be 
considering. It will cost taxpayers 
nearly $800 million over 10 years and 
$1.3 billion in all to bail out Delphi’s 
underfunded, 
privately 
run 
pension 
plan. 
Americans across the country do not 
want to fork over their hard-earned 
dollars to fund a costly project that 
was cooked up in Congress, especially 
when many have their own retirement 
accounts to consider or have none at 
all. 
By doubling down on an already 
failed 
strategy, 
taxpayers 
will 
be 
forced to cover the cost of this cash 
giveaway. This sets a terrible and trou-
bling precedent that will embolden the 
Federal Government to bail out thou-
sands of other privately run pensions. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to oppose this fiscally irrespon-
sible catastrophe of a bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
b 1630 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
I do believe, and I agree with my col-
league, that the facts ought to be cor-
rect and that the RECORD ought to be 
clear. That is why I want to clarify a 
couple of things. 
Number one, I continue to hear oppo-
nents of this legislation depict it as a 
Democratic bill, a partisan bill. That is 
just not true. It is amazing to me in 
this body that we can still have people 
say things that just are patently un-
true. That is not true. 
Just look at the list of Republican 
cosponsors of this legislation. If you 
don’t want to look at that list, don’t 
look at that list. Just look back a cou-
ple of years when then-Republican 
President Donald Trump saw this as an 
injustice and directed his administra-
tion to solve this problem. 
This is not a partisan piece of legisla-
tion. I understand the game; I get it. 
Everything around here somehow has 
to be turned into Democrats versus Re-
publicans. 
I am going to tell you something 
about the Delphi salaried retirees. 
Some are Democrats. Some are Repub-
licans. Some are Independents. They 
live in every part of this country. They 
are people who worked really hard and 
did nothing wrong and lost everything 
that they had worked for in some 
cases. 
Two, the other fact that I want to 
correct, it is true that only the losses 
that these pension recipients received, 
the losses that they experienced would 
be made up for. So when my colleague 
points out the fact that some did not 
receive a 70 percent cut, that is true. 
People will only receive what was 
promised to them. That is kind of an 
American ideal, isn’t it? We keep our 
promises. 
As to the point that this is a private 
pension that was mismanaged and 
failed and the government shouldn’t 
become involved, that ship sailed a 
long time ago when the government 
got involved. The government took 
control of the company, took control of 
its assets, made these decisions. 
So if there is a precedent to be set, 
the precedent is this: The Federal Gov-
ernment makes a mistake, the Federal 
Government has the obligation to fix 
it. I don’t know what is wrong with 
that. I don’t know what is wrong with 
that. I mean, that is the way I was 
raised. 
I don’t know who is watching today. 
I don’t know how many Americans are 
watching, but I hope they are paying 
attention. I know a lot of those Delphi 
salaried retirees are watching. Despite 
some of what you heard today—because 
this place becomes very political, un-
fortunately—despite some of what you 
heard, what you saw and what you are 
about to see in a little while, we are 
Democrats and Republicans who dis-
agree on a lot of things and we are 
coming together to fix a problem that 
has lasted for 13 years, a problem that 
occurred on the watch of a Democratic 
President, a problem that a Republican 
President was attempting to address, 
but who didn’t get it done, and now in 
this moment Members of Congress— 
with whom I have very little in com-
mon—share one thing for sure, we rep-
resent many of the same people, people 
who have suffered an injustice and are 
looking to the Congress of the United 
States as the last chance they have to 
have that mistake made right. 
That is a precedent I don’t mind see-
ing us set. If the Federal Government 
makes a mistake, we fix it. That is 
what we are about to do here today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 6929, the ‘‘Susan 
Muffley Act of 2022.’’ 
H.R. 6929 is a bipartisan, bicameral effort to 
restore the retirement benefits for over 20,000 
Delphi salaried retirees. 
This legislation will lay out a formal proce-
dure to pay the difference between the pen-
sion benefits earned by Delphi salaried retir-
ees and what they received following the Gen-
eral Motors (GM) bankruptcy in 2009. 
Moreover, it will ensure that beneficiaries 
who have already begun receiving benefits will 
receive a separate payment of the difference 
between what was actually paid by the U.S.

(PBGC) and what would have been paid with-
out the limitations plus interest. 
Under H.R. 6929, retirees from this auto 
parts manufacturing company will be eligible 
for increased benefits in connection with the 
following pension plans: 
The Delphi Hourly-Rate Employees Pension 
Plan. 
The Delphi Retirement Program for Salaried 
Employees. 
The PHI Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan. 
The ASEC Manufacturing Retirement Pro-
gram. 
The PHI Bargaining Retirement Plan. 
The Delphi Mechatronic Systems Retire-
ment Program. 
During the Great Recession of 2009, sev-
eral major auto manufactuers including GM 
filed for bankruptcy. 
As a result, the PBGC recklessly cut retire-
ment benefits by as much as 70 percent for 
more than 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees, in-
cluding over 500 retirees in Texas. 
This is unacceptable. Social Security, pen-
sions, and personal savings have long en-
sured that workers could retire with dignity. 
Now, majority of these retirees are strug-
gling to stay afloat especially those with climb-
ing medical bills. 
Therefore, I applaud the efforts of my col-
leagues in both the House and Senate for 
bringing this issue into greater focus. 
Those who have worked hard their entire 
lives and played by the rules deserve the ben-
efits they earned. 
That is why I am proud to support this legis-
lation that will restore the benefits that hun-
dreds of Texans were promised. 
This legislation will relieve the suffering of 
thousands of salaried and hourly workers who 
were left behind after GM’s filing for bank-
ruptcy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 6929 to finally cor-
rect the mistreatment of these union members 
and allow them to live out the rest of days with 
dignity.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. SCOTT OF 
VIRGINIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part E of House Report 117– 
432. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have an amendment at the 
desk made in order under the rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of the bill the following: 
SEC. 3. PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORA-
TION REPORT. 
(a) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.—Not later 
than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Director of the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation shall issue a request 
for information to the public regarding ways 
to ensure the long-term solvency of the Pen-
sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s insur-
ance programs. 
(b) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 2 
years after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Director of the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation shall, taking into con-
sideration the information received in the 
request for information described in sub-
section (a), submit a report, which shall in-
clude recommendations on how to ensure the 
long-term solvency of the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation’s insurance programs, 
to the Committee on Education and Labor 
and the Committee on Ways and Means of 
the House of Representatives and the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions and the Committee on Finance of 
the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1254, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment is 
simple and straightforward. It requires 
the Director of the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation within 1 year 
after the date of enactment to issue a 
public request for information regard-
ing ways to ensure the long-term sol-
vency of the PBGC’s insurance pro-
grams, and then within 2 years after 
the date of enactment, the Director 
shall issue a report to congressional 
committees with recommendations on 
how to ensure the long-term solvency 
of the insurance programs. 
As my colleagues know, the PBGC 
administers two insurance programs, 
one for multiemployer pensions and 
the other for single-employer pensions. 
PBGC’s multiemployer program has 
been on the brink of insolvency. It was 
projected to run out of money in just a 
few years, but thanks to the Biden ad-
ministration and congressional Demo-
crats stepping up and passing the 
American Rescue Plan last year, mil-
lions of Americans’ pensions have been 
saved. 
Because the law requires partici-
pating businesses to pay into those 
failing plans until the businesses go 
broke, tens of thousands of businesses 
have been saved, and the solvency of 
the PBGC’s multiemployer program 
has been extended for at least 30 more 
years. 
For the single-employer program, the 
PBGC’s most recent annual report indi-
cates that it is financially healthy, 
with a positive net position of over $30 
billion at the end of fiscal year 2021 
compared to just over $15 billion at the 
end of fiscal year 2020. So, fortunately, 
it is not at the near-term risk of be-
coming insolvent. 
A few years ago, I had the honor of 
being one of the four House Democrats 
selected 
for 
a 
special 
committee 
charged with addressing the multiem-
ployer pension crisis. We tried to ad-
dress the immediate crisis facing mul-
tiemployer pension plans with their 
participants and employers while also 
considering other long-term reforms to 
pension programs, but unfortunately 
we could not reach any agreement be-
fore the clock ran out. 
Now that congressional Democrats 
and the Biden administration have 
solved the immediate crisis, and it 
looks like we can solve this crisis, we 
should take action to ensure that this 
doesn’t happen again. We will do this 
by getting policy recommendations 
from the PBGC on how we can ensure 
long-term solvency of both insurance 
programs and avoid the possibility that 
20 years from now pension plans would 
again be on the brink of insolvency. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The first thing I will say, I never said 
that the bill was a partisan bill, and I 
would like to clarify the record on that 
point. 
This amendment directs the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation to issue 
a public request for information re-
garding the long-term solvency of the 
agency’s single- and multiemployer in-
surance programs, and to submit legis-
lative recommendations to Congress 
within 2 years. 
I don’t question the sincerity with 
which my colleague from Virginia of-
fers this amendment. However, if H.R. 
6929 is signed into law, this report will 
be a day late and a dollar short. 
Last year, under the guise of COVID 
relief, congressional Democrats and 
President Biden enacted an uncapped 
taxpayer-funded bailout of failing and 
insolvent multiemployer pension plans. 
While the most recent estimate of the 
bailout indicates taxpayers are on the 
hook for $90 billion, without a cap on 
the total amount of spending, the bail-
out could cost much more. 
Worse yet, Democrats refused to ad-
dress the structural failures of the sys-
tem, refused to hold plan trustees ac-
countable, and encouraged further plan 
underfunding. 
The Education and Labor Committee 
has been wrestling with the problems 
facing the multiemployer pension sys-
tem and the looming insolvency of 
PBGC’s insurance program for decades. 
The committee has held countless 
hearings on the topic. Congress even 
established a Joint Select Committee 
on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension 
Plans, of which Chairman SCOTT and I 
were members. 
We already know the problems with 
the system, and we don’t need to wait 
another 2 years for PBGC to issue a re-
port with recommendations. Plans do 
not adequately fund their promises. A 
comment was made about keeping 
promises. Well, we need to fund the 
plans. They overpromise, undercon-
tribute, and refuse to make responsible 
adjustments, ultimately, digging them-
selves into deeper holes. 
Further, PBGC has submitted legisla-
tive recommendations regarding multi-
employer 
pensions 
that 
Democrats 
have routinely ignored. For years, 
under both the Obama and Trump ad-
ministrations, 
PBGC 
recommended

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7219 
July 27, 2022 
Congress establish a variable rate pre-
mium for multiemployer plans to align 
premiums better with the risk these 
plans pose to PBGC. 
Single-employer plans pay a much 
higher flat rate premium as well as a 
variable-rate premium. Multiemployer 
plans should do the same. Single-em-
ployer plans are also subject to much 
stricter funding requirements that bet-
ter protect the benefits of workers and 
retirees. 
Meanwhile, poorly managed multi-
employer plans fail to collect adequate 
contributions for the benefits they 
promise and bet on risky investments 
in hopes of making up the difference. 
While I appreciate the amendment’s 
implicit admission that throwing bil-
lions of dollars at multiemployer plans 
has not solved the problem, this fig leaf 
amendment does nothing to address 
the fundamental flaws of the under-
lying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume to close. 
Madam Speaker, the distinguished 
ranking member pointed out that the 
saving of the multiemployer pension 
fund would cost about $90 billion. That 
is right. 
What she omitted was that estimates 
of doing nothing with the people losing 
their pension, they would pay less in 
income taxes, they would use more so-
cial services, and the Federal Govern-
ment was on the hook for $170 billion if 
we had done nothing. In other words, 
we would have to spend $80 billion 
more to help the people who lost their 
pensions and the businesses that went 
broke trying to save those pension 
plans. 
But in any case, Madam Speaker, the 
time to fix the roof is when the Sun is 
shining. We have gotten past the crisis. 
Let’s find out what we need to do to 
avoid the possibility that these pension 
funds might be back here 20 years from 
now in a state of failure. 
We need to make sure we fix it. Let’s 
get these recommendations. That is 
why this amendment is so important 
that it will guarantee getting the in-
formation so we can fix these plans 
once and for all. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, again, I don’t think 
we need another study. We don’t need 
to delay action on this 2 years. What 
we need to do is increase premiums and 
impose stronger funding requirements. 
The plans are underfunded. It doesn’t 
take an accountant or a rocket sci-
entist to figure that out. Pogo said, 
‘‘We have met the enemy, and he is 
us.’’ We, in Congress, are the problem. 
We need to do this. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

LISHED IN FEDERAL REGISTER.—Any determina-
tion made by the Commission under this sub-

determination under subsection (d) with respect 
to a voluntary standard, the requirements of 
such voluntary standard shall be treated as a

Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) beginning on the date de-
scribed in paragraph (2). 
(2) DATE DESCRIBED.—The date described in

sion is notified of a revised voluntary standard 
described in paragraph (1) (or such later date as

safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the 
Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), 
in place of the prior version, unless, within 90 
days after receiving the notice, the Commission 
notifies the organization that the revised vol-
untary standard, in whole or in part, does not 
improve the safety of the consumer product cov-
ered by the standard and that the Commission is 
retaining all or part of the existing consumer 
product safety standard.

the promulgation of a final consumer product 
safety standard under subsection (a), a vol-
untary standard is treated as a consumer prod-
uct safety rule under subsection (e), or a revised 
voluntary standard becomes enforceable as a 
consumer product safety rule under subsection 
(f), the Commission may initiate a rulemaking in 
accordance with section 553 of title 5, United 
States Code, to modify the requirements of the 
standard or revised standard. Any rule promul-

SAFE CONNECTIONS ACT OF 2022 
H.R. 7132 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Connec-
tions Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, 
terms used in this Act that are defined in 
section 345(a) of the Communications Act of 
1934, as added by section 4 of this Act, have 
the meanings given those terms in such sec-
tion 345(a). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Domestic violence, dating violence, 
stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, 
and 
related 
crimes 
are 
life-threatening 
issues and have lasting and harmful effects 
on individuals, families, and entire commu-
nities. 
(2) Survivors often lack meaningful sup-
port and options when establishing independ-
ence from an abuser, including barriers such 
as financial insecurity and limited access to 
reliable communications tools to maintain 
essential connections with family, social 
safety networks, employers, and support 
services. 
(3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse de-
scribed in paragraph (1) increasingly use 
technological and communications tools to 
exercise control over, monitor, and abuse 
their victims. 
(4) Communications law can play a public 
interest role in the promotion of safety, life, 
and property with respect to the types of vi-
olence and abuse described in paragraph (1). 
For example, independent access to a wire-
less phone plan can assist survivors in estab-
lishing security and autonomy. 
(5) 
Safeguards 
within 
communications 
services can serve a role in preventing abuse 
and narrowing the digital divide experienced 
by survivors of abuse.

TIONS SERVICES.

(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) 
Addressing 
cybersecurity

frastructure after an intrusion occurs is inef-
ficient, ineffective, and costly. 
(2) 
Integrating 
cybersecurity 
consider-
ations into the research, design, and develop-
ment of energy infrastructure represents a 
cost-effective approach to enhancing the se-
curity, resilience, and reliability of the elec-
tric grid, oil and natural gas pipelines, and 
other energy distribution, transmission, and 
generation systems. 
(3) Successfully employing the approach 
outlined in paragraph (2) as a guiding prin-
ciple for the Department’s energy infrastruc-
ture activities will require a diverse, inclu-
sive, and highly skilled workforce which pos-
sesses energy-specific cybersecurity exper-
tise and familiarity with associated re-
search, 
development, 
and 
demonstration 
needs. 
(4) A dedicated science scholarship pro-
gram at the Department for graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral researchers studying 
energy-specific 
cybersecurity 
disciplines 
could help address the challenges stated in 
paragraphs (1) through (3).

grates cybersecurity competencies within 
disciplines associated with energy infra-
structure needs; 
(B) 
provide 
graduate 
students 
and 
postdoctoral researchers supported under the 
Program with research traineeship experi-
ences at National Laboratories and utilities;

FIGHT FOR INCLUSION FAR FROM 
OVER 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday marked the 32nd anniversary 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
When I was 16 years old, an acci-
dental gunshot left me permanently 
paralyzed. That was 1980, 10 years be-
fore the ADA was enacted into law. 
Then on July 26, 1990, President 
George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into 
law, and my life and the lives of mil-
lions of others were transformed. 
For 32 years, the ADA has broken 
down barriers and helped millions of 
people with disabilities to reach places 
in society that were previously unat-
tainable. No longer do Americans with 
disabilities face legalized discrimina-
tion in places of public accommoda-
tion, employment, transportation, and 
so much more. 
In fact, without the ADA, I would not 
be here today proudly representing the 
Second Congressional District of Rhode 
Island as the first quadriplegic ever 
elected to Congress. Yet, our fight for 
universal accessibility and inclusion is 
far from over. 
Millions of Americans with disabil-
ities are counting on this body to do 
what is right and continue the battle 
for accessibility and inclusion. I hope 
to be a partner in that fight for many 
years to come. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER 
RICK LOPEZ 
(Mr. GOSAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Yavapai 
County Sheriff Sergeant Rick Lopez, 
who was shot and killed in the line of 
duty on June 28. 
R-Lo, as he was affectionately re-
ferred to by friends and family, was 
callously killed by a cold-blooded mur-
derer for simply doing his job, a job he 
loved and served for more than 14 years 
at the Yavapai County Sheriff’s office. 
The rise in violence against our brave 
law enforcement officers is both stag-
gering and deeply troubling. Sadly, 
shootings of police officers have in-
creased nearly 40 percent from one year 
ago. Thirty-seven officers, including 
Sergeant Lopez, have been killed this 
year. I pray to God there will be no 
more. 
Sergeant Lopez was not just a hero in 
our community, he was a husband and 
a father to two beautiful children. He 
was beloved by his family, his neigh-
bors, and his fellow officers. This brave 
man will be greatly missed. 
To his wife and family, I offer my 
deepest sympathy. Please know that 
Sergeant Lopez and you will continue 
to be in Maude and my prayers.

EASING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN

(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House

Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, our Nation thrives because of the 
strength of our families, and when our 
families succeed, our economy suc-
ceeds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7238 
July 27, 2022 
For this reason alone, Congress must 
continue to pass powerful bipartisan 
legislation like the CHIPS and Science 
Act. 
The act demonstrates our commit-
ment to putting money back in the 
pockets of Americans. It addresses crit-
ical issues like inflation and strength-
ening domestic supply chains in ways 
that could impact our economy and na-
tional 
security 
for 
generations 
to 
come. 
The stresses of the last 2 years took 
a huge toll on our country. However, 
recent progress, including a growing 
job market, and declining costs of 
some critical goods and services prove 
that we are on the right track. 
Voting for the CHIPS and Science 
Act will help ensure we ease the finan-
cial burden carried by American fami-
lies and boost our economy because a 
Nation’s backbone is its family. When 
they thrive, America thrives.

GERRY MAY AND HOMETOWN PA-
TRIOT SHARE VETERAN STORIES 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
express my admiration for my friend, 
Mr. Gerry May. He is the man behind 
the ‘‘Hometown Patriot’’ series on our 
locally owned ABC-TV affiliate in 
Shreveport, Louisiana, KTBS. 
‘‘Hometown Patriot’’ is a program 
that chronicles the stories of Louisi-
ana’s veteran community. To date, 
they have aired over 500 veteran sto-
ries, and many more are yet to come. 
These stories are critical because they 
preserve our historical record, and it is 
a tribute to all who have served this 
country so patriotically and so favor-
ably. 
‘‘Hometown Patriot’’ will ensure that 
future generations of Louisianians will 
be able to better understand the serv-
ice of these heroes, and it will keep 
their stories alive for many years to 
come. 
Mr. May himself has a long history of 
excellence in broadcast journalism, 
from covering Louisiana politics to the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, to the 
Saints during their triumphant Super 
Bowl win. This history of impactful 
journalism has even landed Mr. May in 
the occasional Hollywood movie bit 
role. 
I thank Gerry for running ‘‘Home-
town Patriot’’ and making sure our 
veteran community has an advocate in 
our local media. We can never thank 
them enough. 
Keep up the great work. 
f 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS TAKE ACTION 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
the American people are feeling the ef-
fects of rising costs. As these costs con-
tinue to put pressure on the pockets of 
America’s 
working 
families, 
House 
Democrats are working tirelessly to 
provide relief. 
When gas prices soared earlier this 
year, House Democrats took action to 
fight price gouging at the pump. 
House Democrats took action to 
lower insulin costs and ensure that 
lifesaving prescriptions do not send 
families into bankruptcy. 
As food prices rose, House Democrats 
took action to reduce prices for Amer-
ican farmers and lower prices for fami-
lies in the grocery aisles. 
But our work is far from over. 
We understand that prices are too 
high and Americans are struggling to 
make ends meet. Fighting inflation 
and lowering costs for families remains 
our top priority. 
Republicans have tried to obstruct 
bills to cut costs to earn political 
points at the expense of hardworking 
American families. It is time to put 
people before politics. 
House Democrats are working for 
America’s working families, and it is 
time my Republican colleagues do the 
same.

BELLEFONTE LITTLE HOUSE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the Bellefonte Little House. This 
celebration has been delayed because of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, but the com-
munity is finally able to gather and 
celebrate 60 years of a Girl Scout meet-
ing house as well as a space for the 
community to gather. 
The Bellefonte Little House is one of 
the last remaining Girl Scout Little 
Houses in the Nation. At one point in 
time, Little Houses existed around the 
country, in cities and towns, serving as 
a physical meeting place and a home 
for Scouting. 
The Bellefonte Little House provides 
a gathering place for troops in the 
Bellefonte area, and the local organiza-
tion supports approximately 20 troops 
in the school districts of Bellefonte 
area, Bald Eagle area, and Penns Val-
ley. 
In addition to celebrating 60 years of 
the Little House, the local Girl Scout 
organization is celebrating and hon-
oring volunteer efforts of many who 
mentor and guide girls in kindergarten 
through grade 12 in their Girl Scout 
journey. 
Madam Speaker, as someone who is 
actively involved in Scouting, I recog-
nize the importance of gathering places 
like the Bellefonte Little House to our 
communities. 
Congratulations to the Bellefonte 
Little House and all those who con-
tinue to volunteer in the Girl Scout 
community on this remarkable anni-
versary. May this continue to be a 
place for Scouts to gather for years to 
come.

FREE BRITTNEY GRINER AND 
PAUL WHELAN 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
last week, I viewed a wall that showed 
Brittney Griner and a list of hostages, 
American citizens, held around the 
world. 
A few weeks ago, the United States 
House went on record to demand the 
release of Brittney Griner and Paul 
Whelan. 
I have always argued that the sov-
ereignty of the United States should 
insist on the freedom of its citizens. 
Now, we find that it has been made 
public what we have known and what 
we have pressed for: The United States 
is 
actively 
negotiating 
to 
bring 
Brittney, BG, and Paul Whelan home. 
It is crucial to let it be known that 
we are negotiating with an entity that 
does not want to be fair. So, we de-
mand that Russia be fair and negotiate 
the freedom of Brittney Griner and 
Paul Whelan. 
She sits in a cage, a cage when they 
transport her and a cage when she is in 
trial. Obviously, the case is that this 
was a mistake, and there is no basis for 
her conviction. We know that everyone 
that goes to trial in Russia is con-
victed, found guilty. 
Free her now. Free Paul Whelan. 
As I close, I acknowledge the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act on its 32nd 
anniversary. It is an important law.

SUFFERING THROUGH BIDEN 
RECESSION 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, 
Americans 
are 
suffering 
through the Biden recession, struggling 
to afford gas and groceries, with infla-
tion at historic highs. 
The working families that Biden, 
PELOSI, and SCHUMER promised to rep-
resent have been hurt the worst by 
their leftist economic policies. Ameri-
cans have been gaslighted while the 
media 
serves 
as 
propagandists 
for 
Biden and the left. 
People remember the energy inde-
pendence, low gas prices, and booming 
economy we had during the Trump ad-
ministration. The media portrayed the 
prosperous Trump economy as doom 
and gloom, and they cover the Biden 
recession with rose-colored glasses. 
The left may be woke, but the Amer-
ican people are now awake, which is 
why 60 percent of the country dis-
approves of the job Biden is doing, and 
only 16 percent trust the media. 
The American people want economic 
policies that put the American people

HONORING REVEREND MARLENE 
FAYE WHITERABBIT HELGEMO 
(Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and 
honor the life of Reverend Marlene 
Faye Whiterabbit Helgemo. 
Marlene was a powerful Ho-Chunk 
woman and strong leader recognized 
nationally for her commitment to her 
faith and family and her mentorship 
for so many. 
When I was elected as one of the first 
two Native American women to serve 
in Congress, she was standing right be-
side me. 
I was proud to call her an inspiration 
and mentor. I am positive so many oth-
ers would say the same. 
Her impact on our world and our 
lands goes far beyond her recognitions, 
but I would be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion a few of them. 
Marlene was the first Native Amer-
ican woman to be ordained in the Lu-
theran Church. She was cofounder of 
the National Native American Board-
ing Schools Healing Coalition, which is 
working to understand and address the 
trauma created by the U.S. Indian 
boarding school policy. 
Marlene leaves behind a legacy filled 
with love, compassion, and service to 
our community. Our hearts are with 
her family: her husband, Harvey; two 
daughters; and her grandchildren. 
I am just one of many Ho-Chunks 
who will miss her sincerely, miss her 
wisdom, and we say thank you to Mar-
lene.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL 
LONG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentlewoman from New York 
(Ms. STEFANIK) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and submit extraneous material. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the Republican New York del-
egation, I rise today in recognition of 
and to honor our good friend, Mike 
Long, the longtime chairman of the 
Conservative Party of New York. Mike 
passed away this week with his beloved 
family at his side, leaving behind an 
extraordinary life and legacy. 
Mike Long was a man of integrity 
who lived a life of service above self. 
He was among the most, if not the 
most, respected and esteemed political 
leaders in New York politics by both 
his allies and his political opponents. 
Mike Long was proudly born in 
Brooklyn, New York, and was raised in 
southern Queens. 
In 1959, Mike enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps. He felt strongly 
that his duty was to our country, and 
as we know—and this was Mike—once a 
marine, always a marine. 
Mike then served in elected office on 
the New York City Council and then 
for decades as chair of the New York 
Conservative Party, where he got to 
know nearly every State and Federal 
Republican and Conservative candidate 
for public office. 
His chairmanship continued for more 
than 30 years, which is a testament to 
his character, his work ethic, his lead-
ership, and his determination to make 
a difference. 
In recognition of his strong defense 
of the rights of the unborn, Pope St. 
John Paul II named him a Knight of 
St. Gregory, one of the highest honors 
for a Catholic layman. 
Mike was a champion for hard-
working New Yorkers and a lifelong ad-
vocate for smaller government, lower 
taxes, and improving the lives of hard-
working New York families. 
My colleagues and I were all honored 
to call Mike a true friend. 
When I first ran for office, I had met 
Chairman LONG
at various Conserv-
ative Party events, but I set up a for-
mal meeting to seek his advice. It was 
in his office in Brooklyn. That is a long 
way for an upstate New York native 
running in the North Country. I will be 
honest. I got lost in the city driving 
and was hours late for that meeting. It 
is a pet peeve of mine to be late, and, 
certainly, you never want to be late for 
a marine. It is a matter of respect to be 
on time. 
Mike couldn’t have been more gra-
cious—I will never forget it—saying I 
will probably win my campaign be-
cause I know how to drive in upstate 
New York but clearly not in New York 
City. 
I was proud to earn his support and 
that of the Conservative Party. My 
family was honored to have Mike and 
his wife, Eileen, at our wedding years 
later. He is a true lifelong friend. 
Now, Mike is in Heaven among the 
angels, and our hearts are broken for 
this truly irreplaceable loss. 
As I honor him for his service and an 
extraordinary life well lived today, we 
join together in praying for his beloved 
family, thousands and thousands of 
friends, and a vast community of ad-
mirers. 
I am so honored to have my col-
leagues here today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO), 
my colleague from central New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Michael 
Long, who passed away on July 24, 2022. 
Mike was a beloved member of the 
New York Conservative Party, a men-
tor to many, including myself, a dear 
friend, and a champion for New York-
ers. A Brooklyn native, Mike developed 
a love for his home State and his coun-
try at a young age. 
Mike’s sense of public duty led him 
to serve his country in the United 
States Marine Corps. Following that 
service, he began his decades-long ca-
reer in politics. In 1981, he was elected 
to serve as a Brooklyn at-large rep-
resentative on the New York City 
Council. 
In 1988, Mike became the chair of the 
New York Conservative Party, a post 
that he retained until 2019. It was in 
this capacity that I got to know Mike 
and got to know Mike well. 
The overriding thing I got from Mike 
was his sense of fairness, his sense of 
decency, his commitment to the cause, 
and endeavoring to make sure that the 
Conservative Party had a big tent, not 
a small, restrictive one. 
The Conservative Party and all New 
York Republicans will miss Mike’s 
guidance and his integrity. 
Outside of politics, Mike was a de-
voted husband to his wife, Eileen, and 
father to their nine children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in hon-
oring the life and legacy of Michael 
Long. 
May he rest in peace. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. ZELDIN), our colleague from Long 
Island, who is proudly the Republican 
and the Conservative Party nominee 
for Governor of New York State. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for her leadership 
and all of my New York colleagues for 
being here today. 
Mike Long was such a special, prin-
cipled, faithful patriot. He loved his 
family. He loved his country. He was 
willing to lay down his life for it at any 
time, valuing our Constitution and our 
freedoms. Our State is better off be-
cause Mike Long lived this legendary 
life of service. 
Jerry Kassar, the new New York 
State Conservative Party chair, has 
these really big shoes to try to fill. For 
all of us collectively, trying to figure 
out how to fill these shoes will be a 
challenge for us, but we accept that 
challenge with Mike’s spirit and fight, 
his inspiration always living within 
each and every one of us. He was rock 
solid to his core, a genuine, great 
American. 
To his entire family—obviously, his 
wife of nearly 60 years, Eileen, but they 
also have nine children, 24 grand-
children, and five great-grandchildren. 
Everybody who knew and loved Mike 
Long is mourning the passing of a 
truly great public servant. 
May Mike Long rest in peace. I thank 
him for his friendship, guidance, and 
service. 
Now, it is left to the rest of us to 
carry on what was a legendary, inspira-
tional contribution to the greatest 
country in the history of the world be-
cause of great marines and patriots 
like him.

July 27, 2022 
May he rest in peace. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. ZELDIN for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JACOBS), 
our colleague from western New York. 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of Mike Long, one of our 
State’s greatest political leaders. 
Mr. Long served as chairman of the 
New York State Conservative Party for 
three decades. 
An article in the New York Post that 
was recently written called Mike a 
working-class champion, and that he 
was. From the beginning of his career 
in politics, he believed Conservatives 
and Republicans must focus on what 
matters for working-class Americans. 
Mike’s beliefs were as correct today as 
they were nearly 60 years ago when he 
began his career in public service. 
I remember speaking with Mike for 
the first time when I was going to run 
for a special election for the New York 
State Senate several decades ago now. 
At that time, we were talking about 
his family, and Mike’s son had just 
been in a near-fatal accident, run over 
by a New York City bus while he was 
riding a bicycle. His son Matt broke 
numerous bones and had countless sur-
geries as a result. But like his father, 
he had incredible grit and determina-
tion, and he not only recovered but 
continued to compete in triathlons and 
Ironman competitions. 
Mike lived out his conservative prin-
ciples. He was married to his wife, Ei-
leen, for 59 years and had nine children, 
as was mentioned, and countless num-
bers of grandchildren and great-grand-
children. 
Our State and Nation are a better 
place due to Mike Long’s service and 
commitment to his principles. 
May he rest in peace. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. JACOBS for his comments. 
This is fitting because my colleague 
from Staten Island, who represents 
Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, 
was the longtime representative at the 
State level and in Congress for Mike 
and Eileen Long. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my colleagues and everyone 
who spoke before me for recognizing 
the great achievements of a great man. 
Mike Long was somebody who I was 
proud to represent as a State assembly 
member and then in Congress. He is 
somebody who truly believed in faith, 
freedom, the American Dream, and 
family. 
As was mentioned, he had an amaz-
ing, beautiful family, who I am also 
very proud to serve, as I represent 
many of them. They are so dedicated to 
our community of Brooklyn, to our 
city of New York, to our State, and to 
our Nation. All the children contribute 
in one way or another to the commu-
nity that we are so proud to call home. 
Mike served and led by example for 
his family. He was not just a marine 
who served our country, willing to die 
for our country. He was also a member 
of the City Council of New York. He 
was a small business owner. He was 
also the chairman of the Conservative 
Party, which made such an impression 
and was so influential in our city and 
State politics for decades and still con-
tinues to be because of the leadership 
of Mike Long. 
When I first ran for the assembly, I 
was so proud to have the banner of the 
Conservative Party and to have the 
support of somebody like Mike Long, 
who had so much integrity and was so 
passionate about what we believed in: 
that our country needs to be preserved, 
that we must preserve our freedoms 
and our liberties, that we must make 
sure we respect the taxpayer, that we 
make it easier for small businesses, 
and that we support individual free-
doms and liberties. 
In fact, it was the Conservative 
Party that was the margin of victory 
in my very first race, and so I owe a lot 
of my success to Michael Long and his 
initial support of me. 
So, I thank Mike Long for all he has 
done for our community, for the dele-
gation, for our city, and for our coun-
try. He will be missed. 
I give my sincere condolences to his 
wife, Eileen, their nine children, their 
25 grandchildren, and their four great- 
grandchildren. That just shows you 
how truly dedicated he was to his fam-
ily. It is just a beautiful family. God 
bless them. 
b 1845 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, as 
you heard from all the New York Re-
publican Members of Congress, Mike’s 
influence cannot be over emphasized. 
He has touched tens of thousands of 
lives over his decades of service and 
really his lifetime of service. 
As many of our Members talked 
about, Mike Long was a man of prin-
ciple. Mike was a man of faith, of free-
dom, of family, and he was a proud 
American. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 
the remainder of the hour as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, for the remainder of this Spe-
cial Order we will have a number of Re-
publican Members from around the 
country who will come up and address 
the big issues of the day, the continued 
crises, not the least of which is our 
economic crisis here on the eve of the 
latest GDP numbers that we all antici-
pate will confirm that we have a reces-
sion, even though the administration 
apparently can’t even define what ‘‘re-
cession’’ is. Instead of trying to fix the 
problems, they are trying to work on 
the definition of words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield first to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
Madam Speaker, I am FRED KELLER. 
My pronouns are he and him, and I am 
a man standing at the podium wearing 
a blue suit, demanding that border 
czar, KAMALA HARRIS, get serious about 
securing our southern border, rather 
than playing identity politics. 
The number of illegal aliens crossing 
at our southern border has already sur-
passed last year’s record of 1.7 million 
encounters. The U.S. Border Patrol 
confirmed in its latest report that 
there were over 200,000 encounters in 
June alone, the fourth consecutive 
month that encounters have been this 
high. 
Border Patrol’s report also revealed 
that 15,000 unaccompanied children 
were apprehended and released to spon-
sors without verification or docu-
mentation to ensure those sponsors are 
legal residents or U.S. citizens. 
This loophole in the Biden adminis-
tration’s sponsor assessment process 
puts these children in danger by expos-
ing them to illegal activity, human 
trafficking, and other dangers. 
Yet, in the same month that this re-
port was released, Secretary Mayorkas 
said that the border was secure. Mean-
while in Congress, Democrats refuse to 
hold a hearing on securing the south-
ern border. In fact, Republicans on the 
Oversight Committee have requested a 
hearing on this issue, not just once, not 
just twice, but six times. Every request 
has been ignored by the Democrat ma-
jority on the committee. 
Beyond their blatant detachment 
from reality, the Biden administration 
and House Democrats have made it 
clear they are unwilling to take action 
to secure our border and protect Amer-
icans. 
With a new majority after the No-
vember elections, Republicans in Con-
gress will tackle this issue head-on. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend; that was 
so well said. As we told Secretary 
Mayorkas in a Judiciary Committee 
hearing just a few months ago, clearly 
what he is doing is intentional, and I 
believe that he needs to dust off his 
re´sume´ because we are going to have 
the majority soon, and there will be a 
reckoning for that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
live in northern Wisconsin over 1,000 
miles away from the southern border. 
Yet, the impacts of President Biden’s 
open border are being felt right in our 
backyard. 
A few weeks ago, I had the oppor-
tunity to meet with the Sawyer County 
Sheriff’s Office where they shared the 
local impacts that they are feeling 
from the Biden administration’s open 
border, especially from illegal drugs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7241 
July 27, 2022 
Madam Speaker, 1.5 pounds of meth 
with a cartel stamp was recovered in 
Radisson, Wisconsin, a tiny little burg. 
Madam Speaker, 1⁄4 pound of heroin 
with a cartel stamp was recovered in 
Sawyer County, and fentanyl drug 
busts have become a regular occur-
rence. There they are. Cartel stamps 
there. In many respects, they are run-
ning America at this point. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with Mayor 
Adams of New York City and Mayor 
Bowser right here in Washington, D.C., 
that every State is now a border State. 
Just look at those images. This is 
now all over the country poisoning 
Americans. These aren’t overdoses, 
they are poisonings. They are delib-
erate at this point. While you in the 
mainstream 
media 
keep 
deflecting 
from the Biden-orchestrated crisis at 
the southern border, cartels are getting 
richer, and Americans are losing loved 
ones. 
Last year, the U.S. saw a tsunami of 
overdose deaths, over 100,000 now dying 
annually. Fentanyl is now the leading 
cause of death of Americans from 18 to 
45. In fact, in my home county of Onei-
da County way up in northern Wis-
consin, the sheriff’s office noted more 
people died from fentanyl overdoses 
than anything else for the first time in 
the history of the county. 
Yet, despite the reality of these 
heartbreaking overdose facts, soft-on- 
crime States like California are releas-
ing drug traffickers busted with 150,000 
fentanyl pills on cashless bail. And to 
no one’s surprise, they aren’t showing 
up in court. 
I stand before you today to plead for 
this body to do something, anything, 
to secure our southern border. 
President 
Biden, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, 
and 
this 
Democrat-con-
trolled Congress has shattered the 
peace and quiet of too many American 
neighborhoods for far too long, leaving 
countless families who have lost a son 
or daughter as collateral damage. 
What President Biden is doing on the 
border—or more accurately what he 
isn’t doing—is not working. We do not 
have operational control of our south-
ern border. Look at these images. Look 
at those images. The only people who 
have operational control are cartels. 
It is time to finish the border wall 
and the failed policy of catch and re-
lease and designate the drug cartels as 
the terrorist organizations that they 
are. 
This shouldn’t be a political issue. 
This is a life-or-death situation for 
many Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Louisiana for this Special 
Order, as we continue to view the deg-
radation of society and the horrible im-
ages that we continue to see across 
America. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, the news is so staggering, and 
it is an incalculable amount of loss 
that Americans are experiencing. I love 
what the gentleman said: It is not 
overdoses now, it is poisoning. That is 
exactly right. It is the leading cause of 
death of Americans aged 18 to 49. 
Overdoses, these poisonings, are kill-
ing more people than cancer, car 
wrecks, and COVID, all of it. What are 
we going to do about it? 
Mr. TIFFANY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I yield 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, Sec-
retary Mayorkas has now been called a 
‘‘liar’’ by the Border Patrol. The Bor-
der Patrol has said: You are not telling 
the American people the truth. We 
have seen it in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Abso-
lutely. I cannot wait for us to get con-
trol of the gavel again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the vice chairman for yielding time in 
this Special Order tonight. 
Madam Speaker, June was the fourth 
consecutive month, as we have already 
heard, with more than 200,000 migrant 
encounters along our southern border. 
The total number of illegal immigrant 
apprehensions 
since 
this 
President 
took office now sits at more than 3.1 
million. That is on top of more than 
800,000 known got-aways. 
It is costing lives. More than 100,000 
Americans—many 
of 
them 
young 
Americans—died last year of drug 
overdoses. Those deaths were fueled by 
fentanyl that illegally came across our 
border. 
Since last October, Border Patrol has 
seized 
more 
than 
8,400 
pounds 
of 
fentanyl. These are not just statistics. 
They are people, our fellow Americans. 
Their families are forever shattered. 
Yet, this administration continues to 
fight to end policies like title 42 and 
remain in Mexico, sending a clear mes-
sage that our borders are open. 
This administration is putting our 
economic security at risk, our national 
security at risk, and exacerbating a hu-
manitarian crisis. A large and growing 
number of children with limited re-
sources are being exploited by the car-
tels to dangerously run the streets or 
forced into prostitution. 
Additionally, over 1,000 people have 
died along our border since President 
Biden took office—many while trying 
to enter our country illegally—at-
tracted by the policies of this adminis-
tration. Instead of taking bold action 
to combat this problem, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Secretary 
Mayorkas continues to claim our bor-
der is secure. 
Texas Department of Public Safety 
Sergeant Marc Couch sees the humani-
tarian crisis every day along the Rio 
Grande Valley. He recently told Fox 
News that to say the border is secure 
is: ‘‘a misnomer of a statement that 
has no truth in it.’’ 
I agree. But I would like to put it a 
different way. Secretary Mayorkas’ 
claim is grossly misleading. In fact, it 
is just flat wrong, so much so that it is 
difficult to understand how he could in 
good faith believe what he is saying to 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I usually end these 
speeches by urging the President to do 
better with regard to our border, but 
the reality is we know this administra-
tion has little or no appetite for secur-
ing our border and instead prefers to 
appeal to its far-left base. 
It falls on Congress to hold the exec-
utive branch accountable when it fails 
to uphold our laws. So, I will close 
today by urging congressional Demo-
crats to do their job, and as the House 
majority at least until January, join 
Republicans to hold this administra-
tion accountable. 
Let’s take a break from voting on 
messaging bills that have no chance of 
passing in the Senate. Let’s find ways 
to come together and finally secure our 
border. This should be a top priority 
for both parties because open borders 
make every State a border State and 
put America at risk. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, that was so well said. The 
gentleman is right; every single State 
is a border State, and I know the good 
people of Tennessee are just as con-
cerned as my friends in Louisiana and 
also in the State of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate Mr. JOHNSON’s leadership here 
during this Special Order hour. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since 
President 
Biden took office, his administration 
has purposely and without remorse 
started a war on fossil fuels and Amer-
ican energy independence. This is de-
stroying our economy, and it is cre-
ating a tremendous burden on the 
American people. 
Biden’s failed energy policies have 
led him to beg, of all places, Saudi Ara-
bia to increase their global energy sup-
ply instead of unleashing our domestic 
oil and gas production. 
This is insanity. 
Let me tell you, when I am in my dis-
trict, nobody asks me about climate 
change. But let me tell you, when I am 
filling up my car with gas, people come 
over to me who know me, and they say: 
‘‘What are you going to do about this?’’ 
That is when I remind them that when 
Republicans held the majority, we un-
leashed the American economy and the 
power of the American energy and en-
ergy independence, and we did this for 
the first time since 1957. 
And what happened? Gas was under 
$3 a gallon, and we actually exceeded 
the Paris Climate Agreement targets 
for reducing emissions without even 
being subject to that agreement. 
America wasn’t just energy inde-
pendent; we were energy dominant. We 
did it once; we can do it again. We 
don’t need to beg other countries to 
produce more oil. We should be doing it 
right here in the United States where 
we produce energy more cleanly and ef-
ficiently than any place else in the 
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7242 
July 27, 2022 
American oil and gas emits 30 per-
cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions 
than other countries, especially Rus-
sia. Here is the bottom line: Oil and 
natural gas remain essential in deliv-
ering the baseload power necessary to 
sustain American homes, businesses, 
and livelihoods. 
Madam Speaker, if we are serious 
about bringing energy prices down and 
delivering real relief to the American 
people, we must invest in American en-
ergy and reclaim our energy independ-
ence. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
comments, and he is right. The energy 
crisis is a direct result of policy 
choices. It could be reversed if Demo-
crats would simply acknowledge their 
error, but I am afraid they won’t. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
think we need a little more talk about 
inflation. I know when we get home it 
is always the number one issue that is 
out there. I don’t think there has been 
enough talk about how the inflation 
came about. 
The inflation came about because of 
excessive 
spending. 
Every 
middle 
school student should know that if the 
Federal 
Government 
spends 
wildly 
more on the amount going out than the 
amount going in, the Federal Reserve 
has to, in essence, print the dollars to 
make those payments, and when the 
Federal Reserve prints more dollars, 
the value of the dollar drops, which is 
why we have these huge spending in-
creases. 
b 1900 
Now, I will make a couple of com-
ments on them. 
First of all, I think the numbers that 
we are supposed to talk about, the 9.1 
increase in inflation, are woefully un-
derrated. Here is the graph that all of 
us politicos are supposed to talk about. 
Does anybody believe that the cost of 
shelter in the last 12 months has only 
gone up 5.6 percent? Where is the press? 
They ought to be making fun of that 
number. 
When I talk to my landlords, when I 
talk to my builders, nobody thinks 
things have gone up only 5.6 percent in 
the last year. I think the cost of a new 
house has gone up 20 to 25 percent. I 
think the cost of rentals has gone up 
by 10 or 15 percent. It is way more than 
the 5.6 percent on this chart. 
The same thing is true of auto-
mobiles. They tell us used automobiles 
have gone up by about 11.4 percent in 
the last year. Talk to your car dealers. 
They will laugh at the idea that used 
cars have only gone up by 11.4 percent 
in the last year. 
Things are much worse than the 
numbers that are put out there by the 
Biden administration. Therefore, the 
American public is suffering a lot more 
than even this so-called record infla-
tion increase of 9.1. It is much more 
than that. 
But once we get done looking at that, 
let’s look at the new spending bills 
that are coming out. Have people 
learned their lesson? All of a sudden, 
we are going to produce even on the 
relatively small part of the budget, 
this discretionary spending, which is 
the part we vote on around here? Are 
we going to do something to maybe 
have no increase there or 2 or 3 percent 
increase there? No. 
When we look at the bills, some of 
which we passed last week, and they 
break up what I think the people at 
home would call the budget into a vari-
ety of different bills, military con-
struction and veterans affairs, people 
want an 18 percent increase for the 
year beginning October 1; financial 
services and general government, 17 
percent increase; the Department of 
the Interior and the environment, up 18 
percent. 
In other words, even after the hor-
rific inflation, when we come back to 
the regular budget, this place has the 
pedal to the metal, trying to spend an-
other huge amount. 
I think the press ought to wake up 
and pay attention to both of these 
issues. I beg the press to talk to your 
local car dealers, to talk to your local 
landlords and see: Have we only had a 
5.6 percent increase in shelter? Have we 
only had a 7.1 percent increase in used 
cars? No way. They are giving us num-
bers that are much lower than the re-
ality. 
The press ought to look at this, and 
rather than just sleepwalk through 
these budgets that get passed around 
here, we ought to be paying a little bit 
more attention to the sizable increases 
in these budgets, line by line, or the 
amount of inflation we have seen so far 
would be a drop in the bucket. Wake 
up, American press corps. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I have never seen my friend so 
animated. 
It is time for that because it is an ex-
istential crisis to the country. Truly, 
when we asked the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff what the greatest 
threat to America is, they don’t say 
China first. They say the national debt. 
It is just out of control. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS). 
Mr. 
SESSIONS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Congressman 
JOHNSON
comes 
down 
here week in and week out and talks 
about not just the problems that face 
our great Nation but really the discus-
sions that I want to bring tonight 
about families who sit at home, fami-
lies who sit around before they perhaps 
watch TV or when they come home 
from church. They are talking about 
their lives, the lives of their children, 
and the things which concern them 
most. 
I remember well just a few years ago 
when America had the greatest of 
times that it has perhaps ever had: a 
stock market reaching the highest lev-
els; employment in America that was 
the highest level we had ever had; more 
African 
Americans, 
more 
Hispanic, 
more women, more people at work with 
a growing economy; housing aplenty. 
It was full of opportunity from an 
economic perspective that came as a 
result from what I think was dis-
cipline, discipline from Republicans 
who had been in the majority. Yes, I 
was one of those Republicans, and I had 
an opportunity to serve as chairman of 
the Committee on Rules for 6 years. 
During those 6 years, 2013 to 2019, we 
held a disciplined view of the budget 
and of spending. We held a disciplined 
view that meant that we did not spend 
one penny more in discretionary spend-
ing than we did in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2015, 
2016, 2017, and 2018. 
It allowed the free enterprise system 
to grow. It allowed Americans the op-
portunity to not have government 
grabbing at them or overburdening 
their jobs. It meant that the free enter-
prise system with gasoline, with cars 
being built, with opportunity, with 
economic success was on the rise. 
Madam Speaker, tonight, we will say 
to 
you 
that 
that 
changed. 
That 
changed on January 20, a year ago. 
This Trump boost that we had, this op-
portunity 
where 
Republicans 
were 
growing our economy, it all of a sudden 
changed on January 20, a full year and 
a half ago when President Biden came 
in and immediately did exactly what 
had been done by President Clinton, 
what had been done by President 
Obama, and that is a massive spending 
bill. None that was talked about during 
the election, but as soon as they got 
control, a massive spending bill. 
This is virtually the same kind of 
policy that President Biden’s favorite 
President, Jimmy Carter, had when I 
was in college that led to 18 percent in-
terest rates. A whole generation of peo-
ple that had to dig themselves out of 
paying too much for the day-to-day 
products that they needed. 
We are back to that. We are back to 
that because of excessive government 
spending that started here in the House 
of Representatives. The Democratic 
Party tonight was on record asking us 
to please come and vote with them on 
more Big Government, more spending. 
Well, the word is out that we are 
close to entering a recession. This is 
something that comes because Demo-
crats have made inflation their friend. 
They have done the things for inflation 
that would have it roaring back to rob 
the American people not only of any 
gains 
they 
made 
under 
President 
Trump, but to rob them as they face 
their future, as our children are at-
tempting to go to college, as they are 
planning for their future of retirement, 
but, more importantly, as they go to 
simply try to fill up their cars with 
gasoline, as they move forward to try 
to live their lives and make their fami-
lies more successful. 
Madam Speaker, this comes as a re-
sult of politics. It is politics, pure and 
simple. On the one hand, you had Re-
publicans and President Trump work-
ing diligently to give people an oppor-
tunity for not just a job but a career,

not just to fill up their gas tank but to 
prepare them and their children for 
getting out and getting their own ca-
reer. 
No wonder almost three in five chil-
dren are back living in their homes 
with their parents. They get through 
with college, and they come back. This 
is exactly, Congressman JOHNSON, what 
we saw when President Obama was 
President. 
Our message tonight is one of hope 
and opportunity. Republicans will offer 
a vision, as we do on the floor here 
every day, about spending and the op-
portunity to balance out what the 
American people want and need. They 
want and need to do away with infla-
tion. They want to go back to work. 
They don’t want to be incented by this 
administration to get money but stay 
at home. They recognize that the 
President pushing the Fed to dump $110 
billion into the economy every single 
month simply means that we have 
more that we have to pay on interest. 
Madam Speaker, I want you to know 
that Republicans are on the floor to-
night to offer opportunity, and the 
most important thing we would say is 
this: Don’t make friends with inflation. 
Don’t do the things that this adminis-
tration and this Secretary of the 
Treasury have done. Don’t have Big 
Government programs. Don’t incent 
people to come and break the law. By 
golly, don’t spend the $10 million on 
fake IDs that the Democratic Party 
calls secure IDs for people who come to 
this country so they could travel 
around. 
Madam Speaker, people are weary. 
They are around their tables and talk-
ing, and they know that November is 
around the corner. 
Congressman JOHNSON, I thank you 
for taking the time to come gather to-
gether every week with a message of 
hope and opportunity. Tonight, it is 
not just that. It is reality. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Great 
words, my friend. I am so thankful that 
you summarized again how ideas have 
consequences. 
Madam Speaker, that is our concern. 
These are policy choices that have led 
to all this pain for families and individ-
uals in all of our communities, and it 
just seems like madness to us. But our 
message is hopeful because we are 
going to turn the corner. We are going 
to lead this country in a new direction, 
and we are excited to relay that to peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. JOHNSON), my good friend, the vice 
chair, for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, my constituents 
tend to say this phrase very often late-
ly. They have had enough. 
Madam Speaker, American families, 
seniors, and small business owners are 
struggling 
to 
keep 
up 
with 
sky-
rocketing inflation. That is not news 
to anyone. Families are contending 
with high prices at the grocery store 
just to put food on their table and can-
celing summer vacations due to record- 
high gas prices. Small business owners 
are being squeezed with the increased 
prices 
of 
supplies, 
shipping 
costs, 
wages, you name it, while they are see-
ing reduced revenues from customers 
who are reducing their own spending, 
of course. 
Our seniors, many living on fixed in-
comes, are struggling to maintain their 
basic quality of life, afford necessities, 
and the gasoline it takes to travel to 
their 
doctor 
appointments. 
But, 
Madam Speaker, you don’t have to 
take my word for it. 
This week, I asked my constituents 
how inflation has impacted their daily 
lives. In less than 24 hours, I received 
over 1,400 responses from seniors, from 
small business owners, from mothers 
and fathers from every corner of my 
district who are struggling to keep up 
with inflation. 
A 
few 
examples: 
Michelle 
from 
Schuylkill County had to cancel nec-
essary doctor appointments because 
she cannot afford the current price of 
gasoline. 
Karl and his family from Carbon 
County had to cancel their vacation 
due to astronomical gas prices. 
William from Carbon County has in-
formed me that inflation has gotten so 
bad that he must choose between eat-
ing or whether to fill up a gas tank to 
attend his needed doctor appointments. 
Rick, a small business owner from 
Luzerne County, has had to slow down 
his business expansion and is unable to 
hire new employees while also having 
to raise prices just to keep his business 
afloat. 
Scott from Lebanon County has been 
unable to visit his elderly father due to 
inflation slashing into his savings. 
These are actual responses from my 
constituents. 
Today, Madam Speaker, I had small 
business owners and constituents from 
my district in for a small business 
roundtable. Some of their feedback on 
inflation 
included 
fighting 
the 
headwinds rather than extending any 
of their resources to grow their busi-
ness, delaying growth and delaying 
projects and hiring. 
One constituent who does construc-
tion stated that the recent T&I bill 
that was passed in this House will now 
create 30 percent less projects in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania be-
cause of the high level of inflation. 
That really hits home, to say the least. 
Madam Speaker, I have to say that in 
only 18 months, my constituents are 
right. They have had enough. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, this is a great reminder that 
this is real pain for real people. This is 
not a game here. What we do affects 
the lives of all of our constituents, all 
Americans, and we have a responsi-
bility to fix it. 
Mr. MEUSER. We do. We can. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you for highlighting that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the State of California 
(Mr. LAMALFA), a good friend of mine. 
b 1915 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana 
again for leading us here tonight and 
getting the message out to the Amer-
ican people that this doesn’t have to be 
this way. What we are going through— 
what we are all going through—to-
gether, with the increased costs and 
with shortages is unnecessary. 
This isn’t caused by nature with a 
hurricane or a tornado or a fire or an 
earthquake or even a war, though some 
are trying to point to the actions by 
Putin and Russia and Ukraine being re-
sponsible for everything. This is a gov-
ernment-caused situation we are seeing 
with inflation in fuel and energy. It 
doesn’t have to be this way. 
So what is really disheartening as a 
Representative of folks is that we 
know our constituents, good people, 
are suffering from inflation. It is im-
pacting everyday Americans and north-
ern Californians in my district, every-
body. 
I have firsthand accounts from people 
in my district who are struggling fi-
nancially due to these rising prices and 
inflation. Inflation is a tax on every 
American, as my colleagues have been 
saying. And we are hoping people will 
hear. 
Rural Americans are feeling addi-
tional financial struggles even more so 
probably than the urban dwellers, but 
maybe it is the same. Maybe it is just 
different. 
Rural residents tend to drive more. 
They have to drive farther distances to 
do what they do if they work on a 
ranch or live on a ranch, a timber oper-
ation or a mining operation, or they 
just live out. Maybe they are a park 
ranger. Maybe they take care of the 
parks. There are many reasons why 
you would live in a rural part of the 
State of California or any part of 
America, Madam Speaker. 
That puts more mileage on your ve-
hicle and uses more gas. You may tend 
to have a four-wheel drive vehicle in 
those areas, Madam Speaker, because 
you might have snow. There are other 
reasons that you might have to have a 
vehicle that has a little more oomph, a 
little more ability to get around than 
perhaps one in southern California. So 
it is likely they are going to use a lit-
tle more gasoline to go where they 
need to go, and getting gasoline deliv-
ered to areas like that costs a little 
more. It is a little higher. 
In my northern California district it 
is not uncommon to see $6 on the sign 
for diesel or even premium gasoline— 
$6. It is routinely $6 for diesel. A lot of 
people drive diesel vehicles. 
They have less retail options nearby. 
Their stores ship from farther dis-
tances, so the trucks that brought it— 
‘‘if you got it, a truck brought it’’ is 
the saying—have to ship it farther to 
get there. So that store might need to

have just a little higher price to cover 
shipment. So further shipping, all 
these things just add up, especially for 
rural residents, on that. But they have 
a reason why they are rural residents, 
and we need them to be for producing 
what they produce in rural areas that 
we all use. 
So a couple of residents in northern 
California, I would like to share what 
their issue is and what their struggle 
is. 
The first story is about an elderly 
woman from Redding in northern Cali-
fornia, which is one of the large cities 
in my district. She has had a tough life 
and grew up in an abusive household. 
She is very smart and very artistically 
talented, actually. But as she aged she 
began dealing with mental illness and 
confided she has begun to think of 
death as an alternative to her strug-
gling. What a cheery situation for her. 
After her mental health struggles be-
came too much, it forced her out of the 
workforce. She began living on a fixed 
income of $900 a month. With $900— 
money is already tight—and she has 
had even more setbacks. Now, like 
most people, she has a family pet. She 
has a dog. Well, that dog happened to 
get sick, like it happens, and the bill 
for that was $500. 
Where is she going to get $500 on a 
$900 monthly income? 
Maybe she can spread it out over 
time if the veterinarian works with 
her. So she ended up having to sell her 
truck for $180 because she could no 
longer afford the gasoline and needed 
the money to pay utilities and other 
bills. Recently she ran out of food com-
pletely and went without food for sev-
eral days. Even the local food bank— 
God bless them, they are doing really 
good work and they are becoming even 
more stretched and more tapped—the 
food bank had run out. 
She ended up calling a friend who 
bought some groceries for her. She said 
that the cost of everything is so expen-
sive now that even cutting out spend-
ing any personal money on personal 
things or elective things or maybe lux-
uries by having maybe a little meat on 
your plate, she is still unable to pay 
her bills. 
She doesn’t have cable or TV. She lis-
tens to the free books on tape from the 
Library of Congress. She said that she 
holds President Biden directly respon-
sible for what is happening, the Presi-
dent and the policies of the majority 
here in Congress and even in Sac-
ramento, in my home State of Cali-
fornia. She does hope that President 
Biden can hear how the economy 
doesn’t work for low-income people. 
I think she understands that trillions 
and trillions of dollars of debt, and 
spending money you don’t have and 
printing more money—inflation-caus-
ing money—isn’t going to get her out 
of it either. We have to have an econ-
omy that works for normal people, pro-
ductive people, and so folks like her 
can be helped. 
Even after all this, though, you have 
to admire her. She said she considers 
herself lucky because she still has a 
roof over her head. 
Another story in a different sector is 
about a family who lives just south of 
the Oregon border in what is known as 
the Klamath Basin, the Klamath River 
area. There are a lot of farmers up 
there. There are issues with the dams 
that are in place that help make low- 
cost hydroelectric power. 
So one day after the public comment 
period closed on the Klamath Dam de-
struction that is being put in place 
with the help of the Federal Govern-
ment and a lot of lawsuits—this was in 
April—the family patriarch suffered a 
stroke and was found by his children 
unconscious and unresponsive. 
Madam Speaker, if you don’t think 
the stress of being put out of business 
by a government that has taken away 
your water, your electricity, and driv-
ing 
your 
costs 
through 
the 
roof 
wouldn’t have a part in that stroke for 
that family member, the family patri-
arch, you are not paying attention. 
He was airlifted to Klamath Falls in 
Oregon which is only a 15-minute flight 
but a 21⁄2 hour drive. You are getting 
the picture, I think, of what rural 
issues we are dealing with, the chal-
lenges of people trying to farm so the 
country has food in this case. 
Now, every week the entire family 
has to make the trek back up to Klam-
ath Falls since it is the closest spe-
cialist in occupational therapy. So 
they schlep that trip back and forth 
with expensive fuel and long distance, 
but they need to do it in order to do 
what they do. They need to stay the 
night in a hotel since the drive over 
and back is a little too much to do in 
1 day given the appointment schedule. 
So the husband is only getting a lit-
tle less than $500 a month from dis-
ability for the family to live on, and 
each week they must make that 5-hour 
trip, gas, hotels, meals, et cetera. Of 
course, these costs are devastating to 
them. Inflation is driving much of this 
cost. 
Things are going to happen to peo-
ple—that we know. But at least mak-
ing them a little more affordable by 
having an economy that works for the 
American people, especially lower- and 
middle-income folks who are suffering 
firsthand from the high cost of every-
thing driven by a government policy 
that is hurting us. 
This green new deal stuff is not an 
answer for low-and middle-income peo-
ple. Forcing them to be in an electric 
car—let them eat cake is what it prac-
tically sounds like when the Transpor-
tation Secretary says that we can just 
replace it with electric cars. 
No, we have to endure some pain. No-
body in Washington is enduring any 
pain, not in the Cabinet and not in 
Congress. No one would feel sorry for 
us anyway, and they shouldn’t. It is 
the American public who is enduring 
the pain while people just callously 
say: Well, these high prices on fuel are 
just part of the transition to an elec-
tric future. 
Well, in my home State, electricity 
barely stays on as it is now because 
they are pulling out the hydroelectric 
dams, as I just mentioned, on the 
Klamath. The water they are running 
out of Lake Oroville and Lake Shasta 
down 
through 
the 
river 
and 
out 
through the delta, that doesn’t make 
hydroelectric power during part of the 
year. 
Lake Oroville, for example, ran out 
of the ability to make hydropower be-
cause the lake reached historic lows in 
its entire history. We are seeing that 
getting ready to happen in Nevada on 
Lake Mead, dead pools soon. 
These are government policies that 
drive inflation, the cost of food, the 
cost of electricity, and everything that 
is harming the American public. 
So I have to ask the question, once 
again, to President Biden, his Cabinet, 
and even the majority in these two 
Houses here: Whose side are you on? A 
green new deal, a la-di-da agenda, or 
the struggles of the American people? 
I hope the American public asks that 
question of themselves: Who is trying 
to help and who is causing the harm? 
Think about that really hard I ask 
you. We are not here just for kicks. I 
am not here because I love to wear a 
suit. We are fighting for you. We are 
fighting for what is right. So please 
pay attention and decide for yourself 
who is trying to help and who is caus-
ing the harm. 
I know Mr. JOHNSON is doing great 
work by helping us with this message. 
If people aren’t going to pay attention 
to what is really causing it, then I 
don’t know how we can help them. But 
please take this message away with 
you and we will do what we can. We are 
fighting here in Congress. We are fight-
ing to get the message out and put pol-
icy reforms in place that indeed are 
going to help. 
So I thank the gentleman for the 
time tonight and for his faithful efforts 
here. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
faithful efforts and being such a clarion 
call and a voice of reason. 
One of the things that is necessary to 
maintain a constitutional Republic as 
the Founders warned us is that you 
have to have an informed and engaged 
electorate. I think people are paying 
attention now. I think they are feeling 
the pain, and it is drawing awareness 
to our situation. I think they are going 
to evaluate. 
I am hopeful and optimistic, so we 
can turn some of this around. I thank 
my friend for his efforts. 
Madam Speaker, you heard a recur-
ring theme here tonight, whether we 
focus tonight on the economic crisis, 
the border crisis, the energy crisis—all 
the many crises—the common theme is 
this: If you review the facts objec-
tively, Madam Speaker, then the evi-
dence shows that all of these are inten-
tional. They are intentional. These are 
the foreseeable and obvious results of 
the Democrats’ policy choices of the

Biden administration and the Demo-
crats that run both Houses of Congress. 
House Republicans, on the other 
hand—as all my colleagues tonight 
have pointed out—are optimistic. We 
are so looking forward to the upcoming 
August district work period so that we 
can take our vision for a new direction 
for this country directly to the Amer-
ican people. 
I believe that message is going to be 
well-received. I think people are des-
perate for the answers, and we have so-
lutions to all the great challenges fac-
ing this country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all my col-
leagues, once again, for being faithful 
and being here tonight for this Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ECONOMICS 101 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
one of the reasons and one of the fo-
cuses for tonight’s presentation is I am 
just frustrated because of the silliness 
that not only has become this body but 
even when you listen to the White 
House, Madam Speaker. 
So the White House is terribly con-
cerned that on Thursday we will get 
the latest statistics from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. I believe it is on sec-
ond quarter GDP. GDP now is the At-
lanta Fed calculator. It is a wonderful 
app if you want to look at it. 
It is basically saying: Hey, we may be 
negative, and when we were all in high 
school they said that two consecutive 
quarters of negative GDP, well, that is 
a recession. Technically it is not. Yes, 
there is a committee that decides it. 
That is what we argue about. 
Has this place lost its mind? 
So the press cycle becomes: Oh, are 
we in recession or not? 
It is not, technically. If it goes nega-
tive it will be a recession. But isn’t 
this horrible that we are talking about 
this? 
Let’s just pretend and stop worrying 
about it and actually let’s try some-
thing unique. 
Could we actually talk about what is 
happening to people, what is happening 
to the country, what is happening to 
the budgets, the debt and the deficits, 
the actual thing that will either make 
or break society, which will make peo-
ple’s lives more miserable or more 
prosperous? 
Because right now we are in avoid-
ance of all the big things. 
But we do have some great virtue sig-
naling bills. I mean, I had the blessing 
earlier today of my telehealth bill 
being stolen from me and handed to an-
other Member because, well, we needed 
the politics. 
Hey, good job, majority. 
But I have to give Democrats credit. 
They have done some amazing things 
in, what, their 16, 17 months of abso-
lute control, when they won the House 
back in the 2018 election. 
So this is a chart I have had here 
multiple times. Yes, it is all beaten up. 
The number is from, functionally, the 
2021 CBO numbers. A couple of hours 
ago we got the updated numbers. 
For anyone wanting to know why I 
am using tape, apparently it is against 
House rules for me to reach over and 
use a big marker and write on the 
boards. 
But the number we had been oper-
ating with is in, functionally, 29 years 
we are going to have $112 trillion of 
debt in today’s dollars—not inflation- 
adjusted dollars, but in today’s dol-
lars—and it is almost all Medicare and 
Social Security. The rest of the budget 
is in balance. 
A couple hours ago—and I have only 
made it through the first dozen pages 
of the new CBO report, and you can get 
it online, Madam Speaker, it is only 90 
pages—we moved from $112 trillion last 
year to—congratulations to the Demo-
crats, they got us to $138 trillion—$138 
trillion of borrowing in the next 30 
years in today’s dollars. 
b 1930 
Now, the reality, we are never going 
to get there. We will blow up before 
that. But this talk, the virtue sig-
naling, the insanity of this place, well 
the Democrats are getting in; we are 
going to pay for everything. We are 
going to do policies that are fiscally 
sensible. 
Well, okay. Congratulations. CBO 
just actually took us from $112 trillion 
to $138 trillion on the math. It is just 
stunning. Does anyone around this 
place give a damn? 
And maybe I am a little on the 
cranky side. You know, I had a miracle 
happen about 3 weeks ago. I was at 
home, and the phone rings, and my lit-
tle girl’s birth mom had a little boy; so 
now I have a little boy. So my wife and 
I, we have a 30-day-old baby at home, 
so there hasn’t been a lot of sleep. 
And I am holding this little guy, and 
I am going, he is only 30 years old when 
this happens. And the economy most 
likely blows up long before then. 
Does anyone here care about the next 
generation? Does anyone here care 
about your own retirement? 
You have got to understand how fast 
the numbers are rotting away from us. 
But at least we are going to have a de-
bate for the next couple of days of are 
we in recession or not recession. 
Well, technically two consecutive 
quarters are not technically a reces-
sion; and the White House cares a lot 
about that because we know that it is 
about the message and virtue signaling 
as the economy around us is burning 
down. 
And I am going to show you some 
numbers here. Could we try something 
new? How about let’s go back to a type 
of misery index? How miserable are our 
constituents? How miserable is Amer-
ica and the public? 
And we are going to look at some 
slides here that show you just how 
much of people’s wages have been 
stripped from them. 
So a simple slide, and this is from the 
new CBO, from a couple of hours ago. 
We did our best to put it together, and 
it is not going to make a lot of sense. 
But basically, what I am trying to 
show is, $138 trillion of borrowing in to-
day’s dollars. That is a pretty steep 
curve. Every bit of this steepness here 
that you see here is Social Security 
and Medicare. 
How many of us here are willing—I 
am the senior Republican, I am the 
ranking Republican over Social Secu-
rity. We are busting our humps to try 
to come up with a bipartisan way to 
save the program, in a functionally—in 
a decade. 
If you are on Social Security, you are 
going to have a quarter of your Social 
Security check disappear. Let alone, 
we expect, just because of inflation, 
your copay on your Medicare is prob-
ably going to more than double. 
The number of our brothers and sis-
ters who will be seniors at the end of 
the decade, who will be moved into 
poverty because of what the Democrats 
have done this last year and a half; 
does anyone care about them? 
And then, this is the stuff we have 
been able to start to pull out from the 
CBO numbers that should start to scare 
this place half to death. If you start 
looking at what they call the alter-
native scenarios, and that is actually 
when inflation or interest rates have 
small variances, and the speed that, if 
you actually go to the baseline sce-
nario, but if you actually start to go to 
a scenario over there where interest 
rates are just 2 percent, 3 percent high-
er than the predicted average, you ac-
tually get in a line here in about 20, 25 
years, every dime of tax receipts, every 
dime of tax receipts just pays interest. 
There is no more government. There 
is no more military. There is no more 
medical research. There is no more 
education. There is no more Social Se-
curity and Medicare. 
How many of you are going to spend 
your August going home and telling 
townhalls how you are going to protect 
Social Security and Medicare, but you 
are not willing to actually talk about 
the real math? 
It is real. This isn’t Republican or 
Democrat; it is math. And this place 
has basically become a math-free zone. 
And look, this is a chart I bring up 
here all the time because it is nice and 
simple and graphic. 77 percent in 2001, 
was mandatory. Okay. This is Social 
Security 
and 
Medicare. 
These 
are 
things we put on formula. We don’t 
vote on any of this. 
Well, about 10 percent of our budget 
is defense; unlike, I had a Democrat 
just last week saying oh—no, defense is 
10 percent of our spending. The entire 
budget that we, functionally, truly 
vote on, discretionary is now to 13. And 
guess what? This is the ‘21. The new 
numbers, the mandatory now is about 
80 percent of all of our spending.

Discretionary, if you adjust for infla-
tion, has basically been flat for a dec-
ade. There is some stuff we vote on 
substantially because of what Repub-
licans did when we still had control 
here. We flattened out discretionary 
spending. 
But unless we are going to tell the 
truth of what is going on here—we are 
getting old as a society. Last year was 
our lowest fertility rate in U.S. his-
tory. 
And once again, in 10 years, people on 
Social Security are going to be taking 
one hell of a cut. How many people 
here, when the political class is back in 
the home district this August, will 
stand up and talk about what they in-
tend to do to save the program? 
So now, let’s talk about the current 
misery. This is what the left’s policies 
have brought to people. Earnings lost 
due to inflation—and let’s use the 
Phoenix/Scottsdale area because that 
is where I live. That is my home. That 
is who I am here to protect. 
And let’s just use the since August 
2020 date so it is nice and simple. You, 
functionally, have just lost 1.9, almost 
2 months of your labor. So you are, 
functionally, almost—in the Phoenix 
area, inflation has been so high, you 
are almost working for 2 months, and 
you are getting no compensation. You, 
functionally, have had the value of 
your labor stripped. You have lost a 
couple of months. 
If I make some of the adjustments, 
you start to realize you will get to 
work for about 57 days. You get to go 
57 days for free. 
So instead of me standing in front of 
you and saying well, the Phoenix has 
had 12.3 inflation, and if I use CPIW, 
with the other adjustment which ad-
justs food and fuel, it is 13.1. 
Screw talking about the percentages. 
Congratulations. Even if you are part 
of the population that has had wage 
hikes, if I take the average wage hike 
in my community, you are, function-
ally, working at least a month to a 
month and a half for free, and this has 
been done to you in less than a year 
and a half. 
Does anyone care about the working 
people? The people that get up in the 
morning, the retired couple, the young 
couple that is trying to put their home 
together to maybe 1 day be able to af-
ford a house? 
I have no idea how people are sur-
viving out there. And does this place— 
we are going to have a debate on 
whether we are technically in a reces-
sion or not because that is our talking 
point for the week. 
And look here, I am going to give you 
two boards here, just to try to under-
stand; and we have been trying to ad-
just, so let’s just use something like 
healthcare support occupation. And 
this is just the loss of purchasing 
power just due to fuel prices. And I 
even rolled the fuel price back down. 
You, functionally, lose, every month, 
4 days of labor. You start to think 
about what these costs mean. So let’s 
use that’s even bigger. 
Let’s actually use—this one I love. 
Does anyone recognize this? This is our 
congressional calendar. You know, this 
is the days we are here supposed to be 
doing the people’s work. 
Take a look, functionally. Come 
down here. You will notice a couple of 
months with Xs on it. Those are days 
of labor you lose. You may get your 
paycheck, but it has no new purchasing 
power. Actually, it has lost purchasing 
power because of inflation. 
Anyone watching C–SPAN today, 
how many of you heard people come be-
hind these microphones and actually 
demonstrate they care about you? 
They care about your savings, your re-
tirement, your future, the future of my 
kids, your kids. 
The average working person in my 
community—because I represent the 
community with the highest inflation 
in America—has lost 40 days of their 
labor. Their purchasing power has been 
stripped from them in a year. 
And I am going to get a little geeky 
for a second. Do you know where the 
value has gone? You do realize infla-
tion, basically, benefits debtors, and 
crushes workers and savers. 
Okay. Who is the biggest debtor in 
the world? We are. The United States is 
the biggest debtor in the world. We are 
basically—one of the wink and nods 
that are going on, I believe, with the 
administration and the majority here 
is oh, inflation is bad, wink, wink, nod, 
nod. 
But it is really reducing the value of 
the debt in real dollar terms, because 
inflation is a tax transfer from you to 
the debt because it devalues the bor-
rowing by deflating the value of your 
purchasing power. 
So we strip purchasing power from 
you, but by doing that, when we pay 
back the debt, when we pay back the 
debt, the debt is paid back by inflated 
dollars. It is a tax. 
So when the left actually promises— 
when the President promises, we are 
not going to tax anyone under $400,000; 
the hell you are not. 
And in my community, you, func-
tionally, have just taxed everyone 12.3 
percent, new additional tax this year. 
You stripped that value from them. 
And the wink, wink, nod, nod, fancy 
economists, basically realized, hey, but 
we devalued the debt by that much. So 
you have got the stealth tax. 
And now you start to realize why 
America is poorer today. So the Demo-
crats get elected. We just went through 
2018, 2019, first quarter of 2020, one of 
the miracle moments of this country. 
We closed income inequality. 
Wages were growing. Inflation was 
flat. Poor people became less poor. The 
working poor become more prosperous. 
The middle class became substantially 
more prosperous. Wages were up, what, 
several thousand dollars in real pur-
chasing power. Every dime of that is 
gone. 
And look, I am friends with a couple 
of the Democrats, and they despise 
these floor speeches because it is so un-
comfortable to hear that their policies 
have almost been dystopian in destruc-
tion. But it is math and at some point 
the math will win. 
And the fact of the matter is, all the 
progress this economy, this society, 
the closing income inequality, the re-
duction of food insecurity, it is all 
gone. In a year and a half of, function-
ally, Democrat control, it is all gone. 
You are poorer today than you were 
the day they were elected. And all that 
progress we made in that ’18, ’19, the 
beginning of 2020, from the tax reform, 
the regulatory reform, it has all been 
stripped from you. 
But yet, we are going to sit here and 
argue about, oh, are we in recession? 
Oh, is it two quarters? No, you are not 
technically. 
We will do anything around here to 
either virtue signal or avoid real 
issues, 
while 
people 
are 
getting 
crushed. 
We have got to stop the whining, the 
small ball around here, and start doing 
something that makes people’s lives 
better. 
And yes, I can go out and snip all of 
the nice headlines talking about, oh, it 
is not a recession. Oh, you know, God 
willing, don’t think we are going to go 
into a recession. 
Okay. Fine. Let’s pretend God’s will-
ing. Let’s pretend we are not in a reces-
sion. Let’s remove that word. 
How could we then pretend—could we 
just pretend—you are willing to virtue 
signal on everything else. Are you will-
ing to pretend we actually care about 
people, care about the economy, care 
about the future, care about the debt 
and the country collapsing because of 
the rate we are borrowing? 
And there are other things in the 
data that let us know, if you are a data 
geek, and you actually sit and watch 
the financial news channels, and the 
talking heads, and the spokespeople 
from the White House, you are not 
being told the truth. 
And how do you make public policy 
when it is the political theater is the 
only thing that matters? 
It is the spin. We have become an Or-
wellian body. We should be ashamed of 
ourselves. 
I am the senior Republican for also 
the Joint Economic Committee, as well 
as being the ranking member, the sen-
ior Republican over Social Security. 
We have been holding Joint Eco-
nomic hearings instead of doing what 
we used to do, where the left would 
have their economists; the right would 
have their economists; we would bring 
in really professional people, and we 
would try to understand what was 
going on and how we could make soci-
ety healthier, wealthier. 
Instead, we are going to bring in peo-
ple and we are going to talk about the 
economics of whatever the pop cul-
ture—gun violence today, or we are 
going to talk about—we don’t do real 
stuff anymore. We are basically writing 
people’s campaign brochures now.

This is really important because un-
less we as a body can get the incentives 
right to get up labor force participa-
tion—I know these are geeky terms but 
our brothers’ and sisters’ participation 
in the economy, I do not believe we can 
get the productivity back where we 
have to be to take on inflation, to start 
to stabilize the economy in the future. 
We have a problem here. This should 
have been the trend line. Something is 
going on. We have millions of our 
brothers and sisters who have dis-
appeared. 
Of course, you have a great unem-
ployment number. We have great un-
employment numbers. They are really 
low, except we have millions of people 
who disappeared. They are not partici-
pating. 
Once again, it is spin through not 
telling the truth about the math. Now, 
it gets even darker and more mis-
leading. I am sorry to be geeking out, 
but you do realize we have multiple 
agencies, multiple groups that do the 
calcs of what is unemployment, what is 
labor force participation, and who is 
participating in the economy, and 
there is some crazy divergence going 
on out there. 
There is something called the estab-
lishment survey. That is what you get 
every week, every month on this 
month’s unemployment—we have ev-
eryone working. Except at the very 
same time, there is something called 
the household survey, and that is show-
ing numbers that have hundreds of 
thousands of people who have moved 
into unemployment. 
How is that possible? How is it pos-
sible that two government surveys in 
the same sample times are starting to 
produce such divergence in the num-
bers? 
I would love to tell you that I know, 
but I haven’t had time to dig into this. 
But there is something going on there. 
There is some noise within our econ-
omy, yet we are all pretending. 
This is the talking point the left 
keeps giving you. Well, we are not in 
recession. Look at the employment 
data, except, also, I need you not to 
look at the household survey because 
that number is going in the wrong di-
rection. 
Remember, how does the Federal Re-
serve take on inflation? They break the 
economy. They break the labor mar-
kets. They raise interest rates like 
they did today. And the dirty secret is, 
oh, I don’t think we will drive it into 
recession—wink, wink, nod, nod. 
Of course they will. That is how it 
works. They need to break the wage- 
price spiral, which is real and has 
begun. You all know what the wage- 
price spiral is, right? Prices go up, so I 
have to pay my workers more. Well, if 
I pay my workers more, I have to raise 
my prices. Well, if I raise my prices, I 
have to pay my workers more. Well, if 
I pay my workers more, I have to raise 
my 
prices. 
You 
end 
up 
in 
this 
ratcheting effect, and we are in that 
right now. 
A couple of months ago, we would 
have a debate on the floor with a cou-
ple of my more geeky colleagues, and 
they would still want to try to say, oh, 
inflation is transitory. No. It is struc-
tural now. It is built into everything 
you are buying. 
Fuel prices go up here, but eventu-
ally, the distillates from that fuel that 
are in that mug that holds the milk 
that you go buy is now in the compo-
nents of production. It is structural. 
That is a real problem because we are 
trying to do some of the math about 
what happens, God forbid, if we have 
substantially higher than normal infla-
tion for a year. God forbid it is 1 year, 
2 years, 3 years, even if they start to 
knock it down, and there you bring the 
Fed in. 
What is the Fed doing right now? 
They are jacking up interest rates. 
They are making your life more miser-
able. They are functionally trying to 
put you out of work. 
They need to raise unemployment. 
They need to create the elasticity in 
the employment markets. So, all of a 
sudden, that wage-price spiral—you are 
willing to work for less because you 
need the job. But you already see the 
data right now of how many of our 
brothers and sisters are just trying to 
maintain their life. 
Their rent has gone up. They are 
using their credit cards. Now, their 
credit cards are going to get substan-
tially more expensive because interest 
rates are going up. Now, we are actu-
ally seeing articles that the Treasury 
may have to write checks to the Fed-
eral Reserve. 
One day, I will do a whole Fed pres-
entation on how it actually works. But 
when they raise interest rates, they are 
actually raising interest rates on what 
they are willing to pay on bank depos-
its. Therefore, they are paying interest 
on the bank deposits. 
The Federal Reserve needs to get 
cash to pay a rate of return on the 
bank deposits, and they get that from 
the Treasury, which is a little crazy, 
but that is how it works. 
You start to think about the math. I 
know these are just statistics, but they 
are also people. They are people, and 
this place has just become cruel. 
I guess the virtue signaling here is 
only done when it is a good line for a 
brochure, and I know it is half an hour 
of talking about economic data, but 
these are people. 
We are trying to do a breakdown 
right now of how seniors survive. You 
do realize how many of our seniors, 
even with the Social Security COLA 
that may be over 8 points, their copay 
on 
healthcare—because, 
remember, 
some of the healthcare inflation has 
been double baseline CPI. Many seniors 
now have to pay 20 percent of that, so 
they are bleeding. 
The COLA for Social Security doesn’t 
keep up with actual inflation, and it is 
also a lagger. I won’t walk through the 
table, but understand we are trying to 
do the math here of how many of our 
seniors basically are moving into pov-
erty, and we are trying to do some-
thing latitudinal over a decade. By the 
end of the decade, what population has 
just this cycle of inflation done? 
On Thursday, when the second quar-
ter GDP number comes out, and the 
White House and Democrats say, ‘‘Oh, 
we are not in recession. It is not a 
technical recession,’’ how many of 
them are going to get behind a micro-
phone and say, ‘‘I don’t care whether 
we are in recession or not. I care about 
seniors who are about to become pov-
erty-stricken.’’ How many are going to 
say, ‘‘I care about the family that is 
having trouble surviving.’’ Where is the 
empathy in this place? Does anyone 
care? 
We make public policy by feelings, by 
virtue signaling, not by a calculator, 
and I accept I sound like an accountant 
on steroids. It is my sin. But these are 
people. 
We are going to sit here, and we are 
going to fuss like crazy over little sym-
bolisms. We are going to fight over the 
naming of a post office. 
At the same time, someone is going 
to go home and realize they have to 
figure out whether they can pay the 
air-conditioning bill or be able to have 
enough gas to drive down to the food 
bank. There are ugly things happening 
out there, and it doesn’t need to hap-
pen. 
We as Republicans have some ideas 
to stop it. It may not completely stop 
inflation, but at least it would help. 
The brain trust on the other side, the 
idea is, well, let’s send them a check. 
That is what caused the problem. 
Please, can you have some folks that 
actually showed up for their basic eco-
nomics class be the ones making public 
policy here? Let’s stop hurting people. 
This isn’t partisan. This is our job. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
PAIN AT THE PUMP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, thank 
you for recognizing the time. I also 
thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD), for being 
here with us. 
I am going to talk this evening and 
kind of follow up on my good colleague 
from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT). Some 
astounding information, and I know 
that he offers it on a regular basis, and 
I wish more people would tune in. 
Of course, I wish more people here 
would hear his message and, more im-
portantly than hearing his message, 
take some action in that regard. 
It is astounding that, in a year and a 
half, the people who are working, and 
everybody is that can do it, they have 
lost a month and a half of wages. 
Think about how long you work 
every year, essentially for free, because

you are still working but you don’t get 
the money because you have to pay 
your taxes, and that date moves a lit-
tle back and forth. Sometimes it is in 
May. Sometimes it is in April. But 
then add another 2 months. If you add 
another 2 months onto that that you 
are working, but you are not being 
paid, that is astounding. 
As I understand it, the average wages 
under the President for a typical fam-
ily—and I represent typical families. 
The average wage of a typical family 
right now has dropped $450 a month. 
Now, that might not seem like a lot 
of money to people in Washington, 
D.C., people that invest on Wall Street, 
people that drive fancy cars and belong 
to the country club. But where I live, 
$450 is real. That is groceries. People 
are trying to pay the bill for daycare so 
that they can be at work. Of course, 
the cost for that is going up. People are 
paying more every single day to drive 
the vehicle that they are struggling to 
afford. 
I talk to people every single day. 
Every single day, they tell me: ‘‘I can’t 
pay my bills right now, and I am not 
sure what to do. I am trying to decide 
how much to spend on food because I 
know I have to have enough for gas, 
and it is not just enough for the end of 
the week. I am never going to catch up 
at the rate we are going. I am not 
going to catch up. What is happening? 
What are we doing?’’ 
I mean, look at the price of gas. I 
mean, the President just released an-
other day’s worth of supply from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Mr. GOOD, you haven’t been here very 
long, but you know the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve is meant for natural 
disasters or national security events. It 
is not meant for political crises. 
A day’s worth of oil sold on the open 
market, I imagine so that the Presi-
dent can say, ‘‘Look, I am trying to 
help.’’ But it is like the fireman say-
ing, ‘‘Hey, look, I am putting out the 
fire,’’ when the fireman started the fire 
in the first place. 
Nobody says, ‘‘Well, that is great. We 
are happy you are putting out the fire, 
but if you hadn’t started it in the first 
place, we wouldn’t be in this problem.’’ 
Mr. GOOD, are you talking to folks 
like this where you live? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. I thank the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
the 
chairman of our Freedom Caucus, for 
allowing me to join tonight. 
It is the fireman whose solution is to 
start more fires, quite frankly. 
You wonder, this President, his ad-
ministration, is there a devious, mali-
cious intent, or is there just an illit-
eracy, a failure to recognize basic eco-
nomic principles, as the gentleman 
from Arizona was just talking about 
tonight? 
Their war that they have declared on 
fossil fuels, their war that they have 
declared on the American energy in-
dustry, is dishonest and dangerous de-
monization of an industry that is vital 
to our economy, vital to our industry, 
vital to our national security. 
To inherit a year and a half ago 
American energy independence for the 
first time ever and $2 gas prices—I 
know we talked about the 2020 cam-
paign over and over. Do you like 
Trump’s $2 gas prices, or do you like 
Obama-Biden’s $4 gas prices? 
Who would have known that in just a 
year and a half’s time, they would be 
so good at jacking those prices up to $5 
a gallon? What is their solution to 
that? Oh, just go spend 70,000 bucks on 
your Tesla. 
The more pain that you experience, 
said their Transportation Secretary, 
who knows nothing about transpor-
tation, has no experience in transpor-
tation, but said: Hey, the more pain 
you experience, that just means the 
more benefit that is being enjoyed. So, 
hey, buy yourself a $70,000 Tesla if you 
can’t afford to put gas in your cars. 
It is making no measurable or neg-
ligible difference on the cost of gas or 
the cost of fuel, but what it has done is 
to compromise our national security, 
once again, our economic security, 
once again. Emptying our Strategic 
Petroleum Reserves for political pur-
poses is just an egregious failure, once 
again, by this administration. 
Mr. PERRY. It is an egregious fail-
ure. I have to remind everybody that 
that oil, that strategic reserve, was put 
in there at rock bottom prices. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
Mr. PERRY. We filled it up and paid 
as little as possible for it, probably the 
lowest prices in decades, and now it is 
out there being spent at the highest 
prices ever. 
b 2000 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Well, you 
might think you can go to President 
Trump and get him to sell it at those 
prices from 6 years ago. 
Mr. PERRY. Not only that, as the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD), 
my friend, knows—look, I am from 
Pennsylvania, we have got a lot of nat-
ural resources right under our feet. 
Instead of coming to Americans to 
say, ‘‘Can we produce more?’’ he is 
going to people that hate America— 
Venezuela, 
Saudi 
Arabia—even 
as 
much as saying that, even though we 
have sanctioned Iran’s oil with this po-
tential Iran nuclear deal pending, they 
would go there and ask Iran. 
But we are getting too far afield 
here. Look, people are struggling every 
single day. This is not due to incom-
petence. This is not due to negligence. 
This is a plan. This is on purpose. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. PERRY. I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. They are exe-
cuting the plan. 
Mr. PERRY. Yeah, they are exe-
cuting the plan. This is by design. 
We live in an energy economy. 
Whether you like it or whether you 
don’t, whether you agree with it or 
whether you don’t, whether we can get 
to more clean energy at some point in 
the future than we have now or wheth-
er we can’t get there as fast as we 
would like to, we are where we are 
right now. 
Most of us are reliant on the natural 
resources that are beneath our feet 
that the Earth provides for us. We have 
done a great job in America of doing it 
more 
cleanly, 
more 
professionally, 
more ethically than any other country 
on the planet. But yet there is this war 
on these natural resources and a fail-
ure or a refusal to acknowledge that in 
raising those prices, when the policies 
raise those prices, they touch every 
single American citizen, every single 
one. 
So it is not just the gas at the pump, 
because that is tough enough, but the 
guy that is driving the truck that 
brings that stuff, he has got to pay a 
higher price, and so he has got to 
charge you a higher price. And the 
electricity that is generated, that costs 
more. So every single means of produc-
tion, every single point along the way 
raises the price. 
How is that manifested? People go to 
the store, whether it is the grocery 
store or whether it is a retail outlet— 
you saw one of the major retail outlets 
just talked about, just issued their re-
port that their sales are down on reg-
ular consumer goods because people 
can’t afford them—people cannot afford 
to buy them. 
People are having to make difficult 
choices, not because this is just hap-
pening, but because this is being im-
posed on them. It is being imposed on 
them. 
I saw the Fed today increased the 
rate 75 basis points. Most people say, 
well, what does that mean to me? That 
means the value of your dollar, every 
dollar that you get is worth less, right? 
Inflation. People say, well, what does 
inflation mean? Inflation is taxation. 
Inflation is the cost of living. Inflation 
is when you go to the grocery store, if 
you can find peanut butter on the shelf 
and you could afford two jars of it for 
your children last month, you are 
going to have to pay more this month 
and maybe you are going to have to cut 
back on toilet paper that you couldn’t 
get 2 months ago or maybe you are 
going to have to cut back on baby for-
mula that you can’t afford to cut back 
on because your baby is crying. That is 
what it means. 
The whole way up and down the 
chain, everybody, the value of every 
single dollar you earn is worth less, not 
to mention the fact, as my friend from 
Arizona mentioned, that you are al-
ready working about 11⁄2 months more 
without pay because of this. 
This is what is happening to the 
American people, and nothing is being 
done to reverse course to change this. 
Nothing is being done. 
I see my good friend, the gentleman 
from the great State of Georgia (Mr. 
HICE) is here. I just wonder if he wants 
to comment on any of that. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, 
listen, you are spot on. It is virtually

everything. I honestly can’t think of 
anything that the cost is not going up, 
whether we are talking food or fuel or 
energy or travel, vehicles. Across the 
board, it is all going up to the tune now 
of about $500 a month that the average 
family is having to pay more. I mean, 
$6,000 a year. 
Literally, we are at a point in our 
Nation’s history because of the horrific 
economic policies of this administra-
tion and this Democratic Party and the 
policies that they are pushing, that 
families literally are having to make 
choices, and they are concerned, lit-
erally, about feeding their family, 
about having a roof over their head, 
about putting gas in their cars. 
This is the type of impact that these 
horrible policies are having on the 
American families, and it is all so un-
necessary. That is what is aggravating 
about all of this. It all has to do with 
policies, horrible policies. All of this 
could have been and should have been 
avoided. 
Mr. PERRY. Now, my friend from 
Georgia, I haven’t been to the district 
that you are privileged and honored to 
represent. I have been to Mr. GOOD’s, 
and I can tell you, they are hard-
working, taxpaying, law-abiding folks. 
A lot of them live out in the country, 
don’t live in mansions. They are strug-
gling to get by. I suspect you are hear-
ing it in your district. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Oh, absolutely. 
Mr. PERRY. I suspect you are hear-
ing it from average working citizens 
who aren’t connected to Washington, 
D.C., don’t have some special privi-
leges, struggling to get by at the gro-
cery store. We would love to hear some 
of those stories because those are real 
people that we are here trying to advo-
cate for. They sent you here to fight 
for them. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. That is right, 
and they are suffering. People across 
the board are literally suffering right 
now and having to make critical deci-
sions and some even to the point of 
getting rid of their pets because it is 
more important to get food on the 
table for their kids, obviously, than it 
is for pets. We have had two or three 
different stories of just that type of 
thing alone. 
What is the administration’s re-
sponse to all this? Well, it is to double 
down on things like climate change, 
which ultimately is just going to raise 
taxes more. It is to spend more money 
that we don’t have, which just exacer-
bates the problem. 
It is horrible what the American peo-
ple are facing right now. It, again, is so 
unnecessary. We should not be here; we 
were not here. Just 11⁄2, 2 years ago, 
things were vastly different. 
Mr. PERRY. Go ahead, Mr. GOOD. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. To Mr. HICE’s 
comment about $6,000, the average fam-
ily paying $500 more a month, $6,000 
more per year, that is net take-home 
cost. That means you have to earn 
some $10,000 to make the $6,000 that 
you are losing just to break even. 
So essentially we have lost $10,000 
worth of gross income to Bidenflation, 
the Biden price hike. You wonder about 
the administration, you know, do they 
not know or do they not care? 
It is not just the gas prices, which as 
we know—and we would hope that they 
would understand, but perhaps they 
don’t or, again, perhaps they don’t 
care, whichever is worse—but the num-
ber one thing that impacts American 
families—middle-income, 
low-income, 
fixed-income folks—is what they are 
paying at the pump. 
It is not just the gas prices that have 
doubled under this administration, but 
it is all the other fuel costs that are 
going up. It is everything that is 
shipped, which is everything that we 
buy, so it is driving up inflation across 
the board. It is everything that is pro-
duced from petroleum products driving 
up prices further. 
Then there is the lie about the fact 
that we could ever move to renewables 
anyway, which is a lie to begin with. 
Then there is the climate damage that 
they are causing because we are buying 
fuel from other countries who are not 
the clean producers that we are. 
Meanwhile, it is being shipped across 
the ocean, which causes more pollu-
tion, so it is contrary to what they say 
they want to believe from a climate 
standpoint, not to mention the embar-
rassment of sending our President 
overseas, as Mr. PERRY said, proverbial 
gas can in hand, pleading and begging 
with other countries to provide what 
we can produce for ourselves, not to 
mention the national security risk, 
being dependent on foreign countries— 
who hate us—for vital energy, not to 
mention enriching Putin with the abil-
ity to sell fuel at a higher price to fund 
his war, not to mention having Europe 
get greater dependence on Russia. 
The whole piece together—economi-
cally, national security, even the cli-
mate concern that he claims to have— 
is all compromised by what he is doing, 
intentionally, willfully executing the 
plan, Mr. PERRY, as you said, on the 
war on American energy. 
Mr. PERRY. And not to mention sell-
ing portions of the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to China. To China. 
Again, the national security threat. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Who he thinks 
is a competitor, not an adversary. 
Mr. PERRY. That is exactly right, it 
is an adversary. Because they say so. 
We wish it weren’t true, but they say 
so. 
I am reading that 26 million low-in-
come households who had managed to 
put aside a nest egg over the term of 
the last Presidency and the last econ-
omy before a year ago have had that 
savings wiped out just trying to keep 
up with the prices that are now occur-
ring, and we are only 11⁄2 years into 
this. 
You know, we heard in the beginning, 
well, inflation is transitory, don’t 
worry, it is not going to last. Then we 
heard, it is only going to be a point, a 
small interest rate raise here or there 
to control this inflation. 
When are we going to stop believing 
these lies? This is not transitory. Now, 
of course, they are saying, well, look, 
this is not a recession. A recession is 
two quarters of declining GDP, that is 
what it has always been described as. 
Now, since the left is in charge, it 
means something else. 
Here is what it means to families 
who are struggling. They see no light 
at the end of the tunnel. They don’t 
know where this ends. They are having 
a hard time paying their mortgage, 
their car payments, and trying to fig-
ure out if they can afford their insur-
ance payments which the government 
has really messed up by being involved 
in—too involved in—healthcare. There 
is no free market there. There is no 
price competition there because the 
government is too involved. 
People have to pay their bills. And 
they didn’t have this stress 11⁄2 years 
ago, but they have got it right now. 
The worst part is, there is no end in 
sight. They don’t see anything chang-
ing, right? They just saw basis points 
go up again today. 
Look, if you are a young couple that 
is trying to start out—look, maybe you 
are an older couple and you are trying 
to downsize and you got preapproved 
for a loan, then the Fed goes ahead and 
raises the interest rate, and you start 
the process all over again because you 
are not preapproved anymore because 
your buying power just went down, I 
don’t know, maybe about $100,000, 
which is significant when you are try-
ing to buy a home and get started or 
when you are trying to downsize from 
the home you can’t afford now. 
Go ahead, Mr. HICE. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. That is exactly 
right. You are spot on. Listen, this ad-
ministration can try all they want to 
redefine the meaning of a recession, 
but they cannot change the realities of 
what this means to the average family. 
Like you just described, we have peo-
ple who are trying to get in homes, and 
with the hike today, there is no ques-
tion that is going to prevent many peo-
ple from being able to get that car that 
they desperately need to replace the 
one that is falling apart or a home or 
whatever it may be, loans of different 
types. This is going to, right out of the 
gate, take thousands and thousands 
and thousands of people across this 
country away from being able to get 
those things. 
I was speaking just this week with a 
leader in the construction industry in 
the State of Georgia, and I just said, 
Tell me the truth, what is your future? 
And he said, it was dismal. Man, we are 
seeing the brakes being put on in a 
major, major way. 
Of course, as far as construction, 
right now Georgia is a major mover 
and shaker, and they are seeing it 
come to a halt, in his words—just along 
with what you said—we see no end in 
sight. It is just now starting to slow 
down, but we do not see on the horizon 
anywhere soon that this is going to be 
turning the corner.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7250 
July 27, 2022 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. They are get-
ting hit on so many levels, as you said, 
Mr. HICE. Housing costs are through 
the roof, home prices, rental costs 
through the roof. At the same time, in-
terest rates are surging—we have got 
75 basis points increase again today— 
interest rates going through the roof, 
so they are getting squeezed terribly 
on housing. 
At the same time, inflation is eating 
away at everything, their purchasing 
power generally. So what do you have 
here? Wages have gone up some 4 to 5 
percent, but it has been doubled by in-
flation. So real wages have gone down 
by 4 to 5 percent, so you are making 
less than you were a year ago, your 
housing costs are through the roof 
compared to a year ago, and you can’t 
afford to heat your home, fill your car. 
To your point earlier, Mr. PERRY, the 
Democrats’ response is to double down 
on the policies that caused it to begin 
with. The President has even said: We 
are going through a transition; we are 
part way through the transition. When 
we get through to the other side, ev-
erything is going to be better. 
I guess when you don’t have a job, 
when you don’t have a home, when you 
don’t have a car, and you are depend-
ent on the government for some mea-
ger subsistence to try to just barely 
get by. But yet you can say, well, I 
guess I have no energy, which is the 
same thing as how they define clean 
energy, then I guess they will declare 
that as victory with the policies they 
have enacted and inflicted the Amer-
ican people with. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. GOOD, you are right. 
Mr. HICE, with all due respect, you 
live in Georgia, but Mr. GOOD men-
tioned heating your home. Now it is 
the height of summer, right? The dog 
days of summer are upon us. Right now 
we are trying to cool our homes, and 
we are in fear of blackouts across these 
United States of America in the 21st 
century. Unnecessary, but a reality. 
California, Texas, coming across the 
country, all due to policy. 
But what is coming up is going to be 
devastating. It is going to be dev-
astating to people across the country, 
especially in the northern portions of 
it where I live, where Mr. GOOD lives, 
and you are going to suffer a portion of 
it, too, the inability to afford to heat 
your home because electricity prices 
are going through the roof as well. 
People realize it now, and they see it 
now as they pay for their air condi-
tioning, and they probably raised the 
temperature in the home a little bit to 
try to help defray the costs, but heat-
ing your home is different, and being 
very, very cold in the wintertime, peo-
ple die from that. People die from that, 
especially in places where I live where 
winters can be harsh, and they are 
much harsher in points further north. 
That is coming. 
When you talk about the rise in the 
cost of living, inflation, and essentially 
taxation, when you talk about that 
with no end in sight—people are trying 
right now, they can’t pay their bills 
now. They certainly can’t put anything 
aside to plan for what they know is 
coming, it is going to be a long, tough 
winter. It starts getting cold, it starts 
going below freezing just right here in 
Washington, D.C., mid-October. It is 
right around the corner, and it is going 
to last until the end of March into 
April and May of next year. It is com-
ing, and right now there is no end in 
sight. We haven’t heard anything from 
the administration about how people 
are going to be helped to afford to pay 
their bills. 
b 2015 
You are not going to be able to sit in 
the car and turn it on and turn the 
heater on, because you can’t afford the 
gas. You are not going to be able to sit 
in your home and turn the heat on. 
That is coming. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. You are right, 
Mr. PERRY. 
What concerns me as well is what 
you just described is just a couple 
months away. States like yours, they 
are going to start feeling the cold of 
winter and will need to start heating 
their homes. 
So the question then becomes: What 
are we doing about that here in Con-
gress? What makes me scratch my head 
right now is we are not having any 
hearings on this issue. We had a hear-
ing today on banning guns. We had a 
hearing last week on attacking the en-
ergy sector. We are voting on bills this 
week about big cats, of all things. 
I mean, the lack of concern coming 
from the other side is devastating to 
the American people who right now al-
ready are going through some of the 
darkest days of their lives. It is only 
going to get worse as winter starts 
coming in the months ahead, and our 
colleagues on the opposite side of the 
aisle right now seem totally uncon-
cerned. We are not even having hear-
ings to discuss this. That, to me, is in-
excusable. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. The solutions 
to it, as we all know, are to stop the 
spending, stop printing money, stop 
causing inflation by continuing the 
economic policies and the fiscal poli-
cies of this administration. Stop the 
spending, stop printing money that we 
don’t have, and driving inflation. Stop 
ruining our fiscal future. That is going 
to cause interest on the national debt 
to increase. The part of our budget 
that has to fund the national debt is 
going to increase, getting nothing for 
that. 
Secondly, stop paying people not to 
work. Stop incentivizing and sub-
sidizing the wrong behaviors. Stop 
making people comfortable as we grow 
the welfare state and grow the depend-
ent state. Reverse the energy policy. 
Stop the war on American energy. Un-
leash American energy again. Go back 
to the Trump policies. Lower taxes. 
Allow more Americans to keep more of 
their earnings. Stimulate the economy 
that way. Stimulate growth and in-
vestment in businesses. Then deregu-
late. End the regulatory assault on 
American businesses and the American 
economy. And then, finally, cut and re-
duce government. 
We have got to do those things. 
Those are the proactive steps that will 
take place. This administration and 
this Democrat majority has shown no 
willingness to recognize how they have 
caused these problems and how the 
American people are suffering as a re-
sult. 
Instead, they want to push through 
more of the build back bankrupt agen-
da. They want to break that up into 
pieces and try to pass that in this re-
maining 6 months of this election 
cycle. 
Mr. PERRY. I can’t imagine that our 
colleagues don’t care. We can’t imagine 
that. 
We are not here to fearmonger. We 
are talking about real-life situations 
that are occurring. This is not about 
trying to invoke fear in the people that 
pay our salary, our bosses, our con-
stituents. But we are here to defend 
them and to be their voice and to echo 
in these Halls the things that they tell 
us, the things that they are enduring 
every single day, the things that they 
are having to live through. 
When you talk about it happening 
right now, it is happening right now. 
My concern, among others, that is hap-
pening right now is there is no end in 
sight. None of these things are fixed 
overnight. This has been a—I wouldn’t 
say a slow-moving train. It has actu-
ally been a fairly quickly moving train 
for about a year-and-a-half where we 
have watched the decline of our pur-
chasing power, we have watched the in-
crease of everything that we can’t af-
ford, lack of things on the shelf, like 
peanut butter, basic staples, baby food. 
We have watched all of that. 
These things take time to be re-
solved. And if they are going to be re-
solved at any point in the future, we 
have to get started now; sometime. I 
don’t know when it is going to be. We 
are here this week, and then we are 
going to be gone in August. Then ev-
erybody is going to come back in Sep-
tember to see how much more money 
we can spend before the end of the 
year, right? And nothing on the agenda 
that I see, nothing so far that we have 
voted on this week, has done anything 
to lead us to believe that we are going 
to address this problem. 
So we are frustrated for the people 
that we have to face every single day 
who come up to us at the grocery store. 
We are buying gas, too. We are at our 
grocery stores. We are at the hardware 
store. We are at the feed store. We are 
at the clothing store and retail outlets. 
They walk up to you and say: What are 
you doing about it to stop it? 
We don’t have the executive branch, 
Mr. HICE. We certainly don’t have this 
branch. The power of the purse belongs 
in this branch. Look, you don’t want to 
disparage sailors, but they are spend-
ing like somebody who doesn’t care

about how much money they spend. It 
is very, very frustrating. 
So all we are left with, Mr. GOOD, my 
friend from Virginia, is the rhetoric we 
have to let the people at home know 
that we think enough of them, and we 
care enough about what they are deal-
ing with to come in and make sure that 
it is put on the record for all posterity, 
for all time, that we recognize what is 
happening to them. We do not agree 
with this. If we were in charge here, 
things wouldn’t be happening this way. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. If I could just 
add a thought to that. This is not and 
should not be a Republican issue versus 
a Democrat. This is an American issue. 
Both parties, Independents, people who 
have no affiliation, the country is suf-
fering under this. 
I don’t know if you saw the recent 
poll that said only 1 percent of Ameri-
cans believe that the current economic 
conditions are excellent, only 1 per-
cent. Twelve percent said it was good. 
That leaves 87 percent of this country 
admitting we are in bad economic cir-
cumstances in a variety of the spec-
trum there of how they described it. 
But 87 percent, that is Democrats and 
Republicans and Independents and peo-
ple who never vote. That is our country 
that is suffering. 
So I think it is important that we do 
all we can to stand up for the entire 
Nation right now and say it is time to 
make some key changes. 
The free enterprise system is the 
greatest economic engine in the his-
tory of the world, and we are suffo-
cating it right now by advancing poli-
cies that are just destructive, and the 
impact of that is not only on our eco-
nomic system but on individual lives. 
Mr. PERRY. With about the minute- 
and-a-half we have left, I will turn it to 
Mr. GOOD. He can close it out or I will. 
I think, Mr. HICE, you have charac-
terized it correctly. It doesn’t matter 
whether you live in the country or the 
city or the suburbs. Doesn’t matter 
what your background is. Everybody is 
feeling this. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Our future 
with these policies, especially on the 
energy side—look at California with 
the brown-outs they are experience. 
That is our future for the country. 
Look at Europe, who is going to freeze 
this winter because of the way they 
have compromised their energy poli-
cies and tried to move to renewables, 
and they cannot heat their homes this 
coming winter. 
To paraphrase what Ronald Reagan 
said: Recession is when your neighbor 
loses his job; depression is when you 
lose your job; recovery, though, is 
when Democrats in Congress lose their 
job. Hope is coming. 
Mr. PERRY. I think that is well put. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Accordingly, I am revising the aggregate 
spending level for fiscal years 2023 and the 
allocation for the House Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce for fiscal year 2023 and

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
the last century—the whole last cen-
tury—America’s prosperity was an-
chored on our country’s unmatched 
commitment to science research, tech-
nological growth, innovation, and ad-
vanced manufacturing. 
The question before the Senate, then, 
is simple: Will that prosperity live on 
in the century to come? Are we on the 
brink of another generation of Amer-
ican ingenuity, of American discovery, 
of American leadership? By passing our 
CHIPS and Science bill today, the Sen-
ate says: Yes, we are, and in a loud, bi-
partisan voice. 
Today, by approving one of the larg-
est investments in science, technology, 
and manufacturing in decades—in dec-
ades—we say that America’s best years 
are yet to come. 
This is a very good day for the Amer-
ican people and for American innova-
tion. The legislation is going to create 
good-paying jobs. It will alleviate sup-
ply chains; it will help lower costs; and 
it will protect America’s national secu-
rity interests. 
I am confident that future genera-
tions will look back on the passage of 
this bill as a turning point for Amer-
ican leadership in the 21st century. 
I admit that some of the policies— 
not all, but some are esoteric, but they 
are vital. All too often we are told gov-
ernment and business think short 
term. This is one of the most signifi-
cant pieces of long-term effect and 
thinking legislation that we have seen 
in this body in a very long time. 
I believe that our grandchildren and 
our grandchildren’s grandchildren will 
work in jobs we cannot yet imagine be-
cause of the investments we are mak-
ing here today. 
Like the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act and the recent gun safety 
law, the CHIPS and Science bill is one 
of the major bipartisan achievements 
of this Congress. But reaching this 
point was anything but easy. 
On the contrary, the legislation has 
been several years in the making, and 
it took a lot of twists and turns before 
reaching the finish line. It brought to-
gether industry, labor, universities,

July 27, 2022 
Governors, mayors from both parties 
and from every region. And I thank my 
colleagues and their staff for pushing it 
over the line. 
In 2019, I approached my Republican 
colleague TODD YOUNG. We had talked 
in the gym that he was interested in 
the same types of investments that I 
was. And I said: Let’s work together on 
legislation to revive America’s com-
mitment to science and innovation. To-
gether, we drafted the first version of 
the Endless Frontier Act, a bill whose 
policies shaped today’s legislation. 
A year later, we joined with Senators 
CORNYN and WARNER to begin address-
ing our Nation’s chip crisis by pushing 
for an authorization of new Federal 
chips as an incentive as part of the 
NDAA. And Senator KELLY of Arizona 
has been a major advocate for getting 
these chip programs done. 
So even before this Congress began, 
Members on both sides knew that we 
had to work together if we were to 
keep America competitive in the 21st 
century. We also knew that if we didn’t 
get there first, our rivals—chief among 
them the Chinese Communist Party— 
would likely beat us to the punch and 
reshape the world in their authori-
tarian image, a frightening, fright-
ening process. 
A month after I became majority 
leader, I directed the chairs and mem-
bers of our relevant committees to 
start drafting a legislative package to 
outcompete China and create new 
American jobs, with the Endless Fron-
tier Act serving as the core of this ef-
fort. 
I also instructed them to draft legis-
lation to plug the dangerous holes in 
America’s semiconductor industry. I 
said to everyone, to people on both 
sides of the aisle, that if both sides 
work together, I would put a bill on the 
floor of the Senate later that spring, 
and that is what happened when we 
overwhelmingly passed the U.S. Inno-
vation and Competition Act in June 
2021. It took 3 weeks, lots of debate, 
amendments, just as the Senate ought 
to work, even on major and difficult 
legislation, as this has been. 
Senators CANTWELL and WICKER were 
tremendous leaders in this effort and 
skillfully managed the floor process. 
They deserve a great deal of praise not 
only for passing last year’s bill but for 
their efforts this year as well. 
A year later, the legislation we are 
passing today contains many of the 
critical investments in that bill. Both 
bills make historic investments in 
science and innovation—the original 
Endless Frontier and USICA bill and 
the bill we are passing today, CHIPS 
plus Science. Both bills make those in-
vestments. 
We will plant the seeds for devel-
oping the tech hubs of tomorrow in 
places with great potential but which 
have been overshadowed by cities like 
San Francisco or Boston or Austin or 
New York City. The bill will help turn 
cities like Buffalo and Indianapolis 
into new centers for innovation, and 
the result will be countless new, good- 
paying jobs and a bright future for 
those areas for years to come. 
Both bills will help end the chips cri-
sis by offering tens of billions of dollars 
to encourage American chip manufac-
turing and R&D. And, if anything, this 
year’s version is stronger because of 
the ITC provisions. It will create tens 
of thousands of high-tech manufac-
turing and Davis-Bacon construction 
jobs from Albany, NY, to New Albany, 
OH, and beyond. It is going to lower 
costs for cars, washing machines, and 
so much more in the long run because 
our chip shortage will be alleviated. 
Both bills establish the National 
Foundation tech directorate and pro-
vide funding to the Department of En-
ergy to achieve new breakthroughs in 
the technologies like AI, quantum 
computing, cyber security, renewable 
energy, 5G, biotech, and other discov-
eries yet unknown. And both bills pro-
vide funding to build wireless commu-
nication 
supply 
chain 
to 
counter 
Huawei. This was a top priority for my 
colleague MARK WARNER, and I thank 
him for his efforts in this regard. 
The bottom line is this: Today’s leg-
islation is one of the largest invest-
ments in science, technology, and ad-
vanced manufacturing in decades. 
Now, of course, while this bill con-
tains many critical investments in 
chips and scientific research, there are 
other major proposals from both sides 
that are still in the works within the 
conference committee. That important 
work must continue. It will. And it is 
my intention to put the conference 
committee on the floor in September 
after the work is complete. 
So let me be clear. Today is a very 
good day for the American people and 
for the future of our country. I believe 
firmly that, when signed into law, this 
bill will reawaken the spirit of dis-
covery, innovation, and optimism that 
made America the envy of the world 
and will continue to do so. Because of 
the investments we are approving 
today, America will be the place where 
the 
next 
transformational 
break-
throughs in industry and science occur. 
Nearly 80 years ago, Dr. Vannevar 
Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Sci-
entific Research, wrote in a report to 
President Truman that ‘‘without sci-
entific progress, no amount of achieve-
ment in other directions can ensure 
our health, prosperity, and security in 
the modern world.’’ The name of that 
report? It was called ‘‘Science: The 
Endless Frontier.’’ It is the inspiration 
for much of the work we have dedi-
cated to passing this bill today. 
In the wake of Dr. Bush’s report, we 
created the National Science Founda-
tion, funded the National Energy Lab-
oratories, split the atom, spliced the 
gene, landed a man on the Moon, and 
unleashed the internet. We generated 
decades of American prosperity and 
fostered an innate sense of optimism in 
the American spirit. 
Today, we face the great task of re-
newing and strengthening that legacy 
in a world of fierce competition. It is 
no longer a situation where we can just 
leave it up to corporate America be-
cause we didn’t have competition. Now 
there are nation-states funding and 
aiding their corporations, and authori-
tarian governments around the world 
are doing that and cheering for us to 
fail—cheering for us, hoping that we 
will sit on our hands and not adapt to 
the changes in the 21st century. They 
believe that squabbling democracies 
like ours can’t unite around national 
priorities like this one. They believe 
that democracy itself is a relic of the 
past and that, by beating us to emerg-
ing technologies, autocracies around 
the world hope to reshape the world in 
their own image. 
Well, let me tell you something: I be-
lieve in America. I believe in our sys-
tem. I believe that they will not suc-
ceed. I believe that this legislation will 
enable 
the 
United 
States 
to 
outinnovate, 
outproduce, 
and 
outcompete the world in the industries 
of the future, and I believe that the 
strongly bipartisan work on this bill 
revealed that, in this Chamber, we all 
believe—all of us, Democrats and Re-
publicans—that another American cen-
tury lies on the horizon. 
For this, these many worthy reasons, 
let us pass the CHIPS and Science bill 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER. 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
here is how Washington Democrats are 
describing 
the 
American 
economy. 
From the White House last month: ‘‘ro-
bust economic progress under Presi-
dent Biden’s leadership.’’ According to 
President Biden himself, our economy 
has ‘‘unique strengths that we can 
build on,’’ that it was ‘‘providing im-
portant breathing room for American 
families,’’ and that it was ‘‘strong as 
can be but for inflation, but for gas and 
food.’’ The economy is as strong as it 
can be except that pesky thing: the 
worst inflation in more than 40 years. 
You almost have to laugh at that anal-
ysis. 
Contrast the Democrats’ spin with 
how working Americans are describing 
our economy. From a grocery store 
manager in Tennessee: ‘‘It’s just not a 
good situation.’’ From a grandmother 
in Georgia: ‘‘The food, the gas, the 
bills, and the mortgage, everything. 
. . . It’s a lot on a family.’’ Overall, a 
majority of Americans are concerned 
their paycheck can’t cover the essen-
tials amidst inflation, and a majority

disapprove of what President Biden is 
doing about it. 
Clearly, something isn’t adding up, 
but that isn’t a new feature of Wash-
ington Democrats’ one-party control of 
government. In fact, missing the mark 
on economic policy has been a hall-
mark of the Biden administration. Last 
spring, they misread what it needed 
after a once-in-a-century pandemic and 
flooded the engine with trillions in lib-
eral spending. Then, they missed the 
warning signs of the runaway inflation 
that that mistake brought on. Now, 
they are mounting a panicked cam-
paign to redefine the word ‘‘recession’’ 
before the next quarterly GDP comes 
out tomorrow. 
So Washington Democrats seem to 
think the real-world effects of their 
policies—the pain Americans are feel-
ing as they try to balance household 
budgets—can just be spun away—spun 
away—with talking points. Well, I can 
tell you there are millions of working 
families who wish it were, in fact, that 
simple, but you know full well that it 
isn’t. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, yesterday, I met with members 
of the Kentucky Narcotics Officers As-
sociation to discuss the ongoing sub-
stance abuse crisis in my home State. 
These 
frontline 
professionals 
have 
watched Kentucky pass some grim 
milestones in recent years. This is one 
of the most horrifying consequences of 
the ongoing breakdown of law and 
order in our country. 
In 2020, overdose deaths in the Com-
monwealth increased nearly 50 percent 
from the year prior, reaching an all-
time high of 1,964. Then, last year, we 
broke that record again, recording 2,250 
overdose deaths—14.5 percent higher 
than in 2020. 
Remember, as of this past January, 2 
years into the pandemic, fentanyl 
alone had killed more Americans aged 
18 to 45 than the coronavirus. That is 
not even all overdoses; that is just 
fentanyl alone. 
The Kentucky law enforcement offi-
cers with whom I got to visit work 
every day to try to reverse these heart- 
wrenching trends. They have had some 
success. Earlier this month, in Louis-
ville, law enforcement seized a full 
kilogram of fentanyl in Louisville. The 
experts say that is enough to kill half 
a million people in Louisville alone. 
But they are struggling to stem the 
cascade of narcotics pouring into our 
streets. The reason for this, they told 
me, is pretty clear: our unsecured bor-
ders. 
Already this year, our overwhelmed 
Customs and Border Patrol agents en-
countered more than 1.6 million illegal 
crossers down at the border. That is 
close to the total number of encounters 
for the entirety of last year. Some of 
these individuals were promptly de-
tained and deported, but many of them 
were booked briefly and then released 
into the American heartland. Presum-
ably, we will never hear from most of 
them ever again. These are just the 
known encounters, to say nothing of 
the 900,000 ‘‘got-aways’’ that DHS offi-
cials think have taken place since the 
beginning of the last fiscal year. Put 
another way, a group of people larger 
than the entire population in my 
hometown broke into our country 
without interacting with border agents 
at all. 
Alongside this human tide is an ever- 
increasing flood of illicit drugs, most 
notably fentanyl. That drug played a 
role in 72 percent of overdoses in Ken-
tucky last year. CBP officials have 
seized 5,722 pounds of the stuff this 
year alone. Imagine how much slipped 
through their fingers and onto our 
streets. 
Are Democrats admitting this is an 
emergency? Are they working overtime 
to put a tourniquet on this crisis? Just 
the 
opposite. 
Secretary 
Mayorkas 
jetted to a summit in Aspen earlier 
this month and pronounced that ‘‘the 
border is secure.’’ That is our Sec-
retary of Homeland Security. Maybe 
that kind of talk plays well at a ritzy 
ski resort packed with liberals. It 
doesn’t play very well with law en-
forcement 
and 
first 
responders 
in 
States like Kentucky who have to deal 
with crime and fatal drug overdoses 
every single day. The far left throws 
our borders open for ideological rea-
sons, and it is the most vulnerable 
communities that end up paying the 
deadly price. 
The president of the National Border 
Patrol Council has directly contra-
dicted the Biden administration’s in-
sistence that our southern border is in 
great shape. Here is what he had to 
say. This is the president of the Na-
tional Border Patrol Council: 
[T]he cartels use illegal border crossers to 
facilitate their higher value contraband, in-
cluding . . . fentanyl. 
In other words, more illegal immi-
gration means more of this illegal poi-
son. But President Biden and Wash-
ington Democrats simply won’t admit 
it. Their response to the border crisis 
has been to issue new internal guidance 
encouraging border personnel to use 
more politically correct language when 
they are referring to criminal aliens. 
They would rather police language 
than police the border. 
Remember, the Biden administration 
spent taxpayer dollars going to court, 
arguing they have a right to end the 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy and throw 
our borders open even wider. President 
Biden tried to cut funding for ICE in 
his most recent budget. 
Washington liberals say the compas-
sionate policy is to lure desperate peo-
ple into inhumane conditions, let the 
drug cartels have open season, and let 
Americans die as a result. That is not 
compassion; that is cruelty—an abdica-
tion of duty with deadly consequences 
for the American people. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Biden 
border crisis continues to rage. Last 
month, U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection encountered 207,416 individuals 
attempting to cross our southern bor-
der illegally, the highest June number 
ever recorded. And April and May suc-
cessively set records for the highest 
numbers for any month ever. 
During the 2021 fiscal year, Customs 
and Border Protection encountered a 
record number of individuals attempt-
ing to cross our southern border ille-
gally—1,734,686, to be precise—a record. 
We still have 3 months to go for this 
fiscal year, but we have already ex-
ceeded last year’s number by more 
than 11,000. That is right. In just 9 
months, we have already exceeded last 
year’s record number of apprehensions. 
The situation on our southern border 
is out of control, although you would 
never know it to hear the President 
and his administration. ‘‘The border is 
secure’’ the President’s Homeland Se-
curity Secretary said just a few days 
ago. Again, The border is secure. My 
only question is how he said that with 
a straight face. 
Our southern border is the opposite 
of secure. It is in crisis. The flood of il-
legal immigration is so great that huge 
numbers of Customs and Border Pro-
tection officers have been pulled off the 
border to process migrants. A May ar-
ticle from the Economist reported 
that: 
Around 60 percent of CBP agents have been 
assigned to process migrants, taking them 
away from field work. 
That, of course, leaves our borders 
wide open to illegal activity, including 
the drug trafficking that is flooding 
our country with fentanyl. 
It also means even with all the appre-
hensions the Border Patrol has made, 
many more individuals are getting 
through unstopped. One source reports 
that so far this fiscal year, there have 
been more than half a million got- 
aways—in other words, individuals the 
Border Patrol saw but was unable to 
apprehend. 
The Economist article I mentioned 
also noted: 
One border expert estimates that less than 
20 percent of people trying to cross the bor-
der undetected are stopped. 
Less than 20 percent—that is a secu-
rity nightmare. 
Our Customs and Border Protection 
agents are giving this job their all, but 
there is no way for them to keep up 
with the flood of illegal immigration, 
especially when they are being pulled 
off the border to process migrants. 
It is President Biden’s job to help 
stop this border crisis, but when he is 
not pretending this crisis doesn’t exist, 
he is taking actions that are contrib-
uting to this disaster. On his very first 
day in office, President Biden rescinded

the declaration of a national emer-
gency at our southern border. He halt-
ed construction of the border wall. He 
revoked a Trump administration order 
that called for the government to 
faithfully execute our immigration 
laws. And his Department of Homeland 
Security issued guidelines pausing de-
portations, except under certain cir-
cumstances. That was all, again, on his 
first day in office. 
Needless to say, the effect of all this 
was to declare to the world that the 
U.S. borders were effectively open. And 
even as huge numbers of illegal immi-
grants pour across our southern border, 
he has continued to build on those ac-
tions. The President sought to signifi-
cantly limit the ability of Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement to enforce 
immigration laws. 
Deportations dropped precipitously 
during fiscal year 2021, as did arrests in 
the interior of the country. In March of 
this year, the administration rescinded 
a 2019 rule expanding expedited re-
moval for individuals here illegally. 
And, of course, the administration is 
still attempting to remove title 42 
COVID–19 restrictions, with no viable 
plan to control the resulting surge in 
illegal immigration. 
Illegal immigration, especially the 
kind of out-of-control illegal immigra-
tion we are currently experiencing, has 
serious consequences. I have already 
mentioned some of the security risks it 
presents. With Customs and Border 
Protection overstretched, it is easier 
for bad actors to cross the border into 
our country—gang members, drug traf-
fickers, human smugglers, and the list 
goes on. 
Our country is currently in the midst 
of a fentanyl crisis. In fact, right now, 
fentanyl overdose is the leading cause 
of death for American adults between 
the ages of 18 and 45. And where is all 
this fentanyl coming from? Most of it 
is being trafficked across our southern 
border. The current border situation is 
undoubtedly 
facilitating 
that 
traf-
ficking. 
Illegal immigration is financially 
costly, as well. Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement is currently running 
out of money for this year, thanks, in 
part, to the out-of-control situation at 
our southern border. 
President Biden has talked about 
wanting to build a ‘‘fair, orderly, and 
humane’’ immigration system. There is 
nothing—nothing—humane about our 
current situation. Encouraging illegal 
immigration, as the President’s poli-
cies have done, has contributed to a 
humanitarian crisis that saw 557 mi-
grants die attempting to cross the 
southern border during fiscal year 2021. 
Just last month, in an incredibly trag-
ic, horrific story, 53 migrants died in 
an 
unair-conditioned 
tractor-trailer 
after being smuggled across the border. 
It was a sober reminder of the human 
costs of policies that enable illegal im-
migration. 
The President may think that his 
border policies are compassionate, but, 
again, he would be wrong. Policies that 
encourage illegal immigration, that 
encourage individuals to undertake the 
often dangerous journey across our 
southern border often at the mercy of 
human smugglers are the very opposite 
of compassionate. I would like to think 
that the President would wake up to 
the dangerous situation we are in and 
take action to help stem the flood of il-
legal immigration at our southern bor-
der, but after a year and a half of his 
administration’s neglecting this crisis, 
I am not getting my hopes up. I am 
afraid that, like inflation, out-of-con-
trol illegal immigration has become a 
fact of life in the Biden Presidency. As 
with inflation, Americans and those 
vulnerable individuals who are at-
tempting to enter our country, will be 
left to suffer the consequences. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
H.R. 4346 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, when it 
comes to America, I am an optimist— 
always. You see, I can’t help but ap-
proach the future with great hope. 
After all, as Americans, we have never 
let obstacles stand in our way or ac-
cepted that problems can’t be solved. 
Our citizens are the world’s most in-
genious; our military, its mightiest; 
our economy, the strongest; and our 
innovators, the most creative. The last 
century was defined by our accomplish-
ments and our ideals and I believe this 
one will be, too. But I have to say, this 
path is not guaranteed. 
Now as then, America’s success de-
pends on unleashing the potential of 
our people and outcompeting and out- 
innovating global rivals who don’t 
share our values or our economic inter-
ests. 
Right now, we are in the middle of a 
great power competition with an au-
thoritarian regime in Beijing that 
seeks global primacy and rejects de-
mocracy. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party is currently investing $1.4 tril-
lion in frontier technologies that will 
dominate the 21st century—artificial 
intelligence, 
quantum 
computing, 
hypersonics, among other key tech-
nologies. Its innovators are earning 
patents and publishing research in AI 
at greater rates than our own. Its 
schools are producing four times the 
STEM graduates as America’s. The 
Chinese Communist Party’s computer 
and science universities are regularly 
outranking ours. 
Its military is making advances in 
cyber warfare and the development of 
hypersonic weapons, autonomous vehi-
cles, electronic and cyber warfare, and 
orbital bombardment systems. 
These are the technologies that will 
dominate the 21st century, economi-
cally and militarily. 
China’s Government is planning on 
winning the AI race, winning future 
wars, and winning the future. The 
truth is, if we are being honest with 
ourselves, Beijing is well on its way to 
accomplishing these goals. America is 
at risk of falling behind economically 
and technologically to a world power 
that doesn’t value liberty or even 
human life. 
So how should we respond? 
For too long, when it comes to Chi-
nese aggression, America has relied on 
a strategy of deterrence, taking steps 
like blocking Huawei from doing busi-
ness in the U.S., tightening export con-
trols, and improving foreign invest-
ment rules. 
Now, these are important measures, 
but they are no longer enough. You see, 
it is time to go on the offensive. And 
that is exactly what this legislation— 
which has gone by many names from 
the Endless Frontier Act to the U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act to 
CHIPS+—will do: unleash private sec-
tor 
innovation 
while 
significantly 
boosting Federal national security in-
vestments. 
Let me highlight a few specifics. 
First, this bill greatly encourages do-
mestic investment in semiconductor 
production. Right now, the USA is al-
most entirely reliant on other nations 
for high-tech computer chips that 
power our smartphones, automobiles, 
household 
appliances, 
and 
military 
platforms. In fact, the recent shortage 
of these chips has hobbled our econ-
omy; it has hit our pocketbooks. 
For example, a shortage of computer 
chips forced General Motors to idle its 
assembly plant in Fort Wayne, IN, 
twice already this year. U.S. semicon-
ductor production, once accounting for 
nearly 40 percent of the world’s supply, 
has dropped to just 12 percent, while 
China’s production share is increasing 
rapidly. Ninety percent of the chips 
used in our military technology are 
made overseas. Let me say that again. 
Ninety percent of the chips used in our 
military technology are made overseas. 
Most are made in South Korea and Tai-
wan, but an increasing number are pro-
duced in China. This is a very real eco-
nomic and national security vulnera-
bility. 
And this bill will reassert America’s 
place in this industry and take a giant 
leap towards ensuring that our supply 
chain and national defense will never 
be at the mercy of technology produced 
overseas. 
Another important aspect of this bill 
is critical applied research funding. 
This legislation reforms and invests in 
the National Science Foundation to 
partner with the private sector and 
universities to develop critical emerg-
ing technologies that will transform 
the global landscape. We know that na-
tional success and competitiveness in 
the 21st century economy will be built 
on emerging technologies like quan-
tum computing and artificial intel-
ligence. 
Funding research crucial to keeping 
America safe is one of the Federal Gov-
ernment’s responsibilities, and this leg-
islation will help us not just catch up 
with but overtake China in these crit-
ical areas. 
And this bill will establish regional 
technology hubs across our country,

which will become centers for the re-
search, development, entrepreneurship, 
and manufacturing of new key tech-
nologies. 
This is incredibly important at a 
time when too many Americans in the 
heartland feel left out and too many 
areas overlooked, when only a handful 
of cities account for nearly 90 percent 
of job growth in these advanced sec-
tors. 
Simply put, this bill will make 
America stronger, safer, and more 
prosperous. And it is desperately need-
ed. How do we know? Because the Chi-
nese Communist Party has actively 
lobbied against this legislation. They 
know this bill is bad for China and 
good for the United States of America. 
This bill is about securing our coun-
try, giving our people the tools to 
flourish, and ensuring America con-
tinues its global research role. 
It has been a long journey to get to 
this point, but history will show that 
by passing this CHIPS+ bill, we are 
confronting the challenges of today 
and building a prosperous and secure 
tomorrow for all Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SANDERS. I have heard, time 
and again, my Republican colleagues 
and a number of Democrats voice their 
serious concern about the deficit and 
our national debt. We are told that be-
cause of the deficit that at a time when 
we have the highest rate of childhood 
poverty of almost any major country 
on Earth, we cannot extend the child 
tax credit to help working parents and 
substantially reduce childhood pov-
erty. 
At a time when over 600,000 Ameri-
cans are homeless and some 18 million 
families are spending half of their in-
comes on the high cost of housing, we 
are told over and over again that be-
cause of the deficit we cannot build the 
low-income, affordable housing we des-
perately need. 
At a time when millions of senior 
citizens in this country desperately 
need help to go to a dentist because 
their teeth are rotting in their mouths, 
they can’t afford hearing aids, they 
can’t afford eyeglasses, we are told 
that we cannot afford to expand Medi-
care because of the deficit. 
At a time when the average family in 
this country is spending $15,000 a year 
on childcare—an unimaginable amount 
of money for a working family—we are 
told that we cannot reform a dysfunc-
tional childcare system because of the 
deficit. 
At a time when some 70 million 
Americans are uninsured or under-
insured, we are told that we cannot 
guarantee healthcare to all Americans 
as a human right—like virtually every 
other major country does—because of 
the deficit. 
In other words, despite the fact that 
half of the people in our country today 
are living paycheck to paycheck, de-
spite the fact that half of our seniors 
live on incomes of $25,000 or less, de-
spite the fact that we have more in-
come and wealth inequality today than 
we have had in 100 years, where three 
billionaires own more wealth than the 
bottom half of America, despite all of 
that, whenever it comes to protecting 
the needs of low-income or working 
families, I hear, over and over again, 
we just cannot afford to do that be-
cause of the deficit. 
Well, guess what? All of that pro-
found and serious concern about the 
deficit fades away when it comes to 
providing a $76 billion blank check to 
the highly profitable microchip indus-
try with no protections at all for the 
American taxpayer. 
Somehow the deficit is of great con-
cern when it comes to providing help to 
working families, to low-income Amer-
icans, to children, to seniors, but it is 
not a concern when you provide mas-
sive corporate welfare for enormously 
profitable multinational corporations. 
I guess when the semiconductor in-
dustry spends $19 million on lobbying 
this year alone and when Intel spends 
$100 million on lobbying and campaign 
contributions over the past 20 years, 
when that industry says: Jump, the re-
sponse from Congress is: How high? 
That is what a political system domi-
nated by Big Money looks like. The 
people in this country who desperately 
need help can’t get it. The corporations 
that are making huge profits and the 
CEOs who are making exorbitant com-
pensation 
packages 
get 
everything 
they need—and more. 
In other words, it appears that the 
deep concerns about the deficit are 
rather selective. 
Now, after I finish my remarks, I will 
give my colleagues a chance to prove 
me wrong. I will be raising a budget 
point of order against this bill because 
it increases the deficit by over $79 bil-
lion, with $76 billion of that money 
going to the microchip industry with 
no strings attached. 
Let me be very clear. There is no 
doubt that there is a global shortage of 
microchips and semiconductors, which 
is making it harder for manufacturers 
to produce the cars, cell phones, house-
hold appliances, and electronic equip-
ment that we need. And that is why I 
fully support efforts to expand U.S. 
microchip production. 
But the question we should be asking 
is this: Should American taxpayers 
provide the microchip industry with a 
blank check of over $76 billion at a 
time when semiconductor companies 
are making tens of billions of dollars in 
profit right now and paying the head of 
Intel some $170 million a year in com-
pensation? And I think the answer to 
that question is a resounding no. 
That is why, at the conclusion of my 
remarks, I will be asking unanimous 
consent to attach an amendment to 
this legislation. 
This 
amendment 
is 
simple 
and 
straightforward. 
It 
would 
prevent 
microchip companies from receiving 
grants under this legislation unless 
they agreed not to buy back their own 
stock—not complicated. 
Now, this is rather amazing. This is 
really quite incredible and tells you 
where we are as a nation politically. 
Over the past decade, semiconductor 
companies have spent nearly $250 bil-
lion—70 percent of their profits—not on 
research and development, not on 
building 
new 
microchip 
plants 
in 
America—what this bill is presumably 
about—but on buying back their own 
stock to enrich their wealthy share-
holders. 
Let me repeat: The industry that is 
asking for $76 billion of corporate wel-
fare today, over the past decade spent 
$250 billion—70 percent of their prof-
its—not on research and development, 
not on building new microchip plants 
in America but on buying back their 
own stock to enrich their wealthy 
stockholders. 
Apparently, they just couldn’t find 
$76 billion of their own money to invest 
in new plants in America. They need 
the taxpayers of this country to do it 
for them. 
Do any of my colleagues really be-
lieve we should allow microchip com-
panies to receive $76 billion in taxpayer 
assistance without a ban on stock 
buybacks? 
Under my amendment, microchip 
companies would not be allowed to re-
ceive taxpayer assistance unless they 
agreed they would not repeal existing 
collective bargaining agreements and 
would remain neutral in any union or-
ganizing effort. 
Do any of my colleagues believe that 
we should be handing out corporate 
welfare to profitable corporations who 
are engaged in busting unions? 
Under 
my 
agreement, 
microchip 
companies would not be able to receive 
$76 billion in taxpayer assistance un-
less they agreed not to outsource jobs 
overseas. 
Now, I heard my colleague from Indi-
ana speak a moment ago about the cri-
sis in the microchip industry, how we 
are producing a smaller and smaller 
amount, but he forgot to mention— 
somehow forgot to mention—that over 
the last 20 years, the microchip indus-
try has shut down over 780 manufac-
turing plants and other establishments 
in the United States and eliminated 
150,000 American jobs while moving 
most of its production overseas. 
In other words, what taxpayers are 
doing are rebuilding an industry that 
was destroyed by the industry itself by 
going abroad in search of more profit. 
Under my amendment, microchip 
companies would be prevented from re-
ceiving taxpayer assistance unless they 
agree to issue warrants or equity 
stakes to the Federal Government. 
Now, I happen to believe in industrial 
policy. I think it makes sense for the 
government and private sector to be 
working together when it is mutually 
beneficial. If private companies, how-
ever, are going to benefit from gen-
erous taxpayer subsidies—$76 billion—

July 27, 2022 
the financial gains made by these com-
panies must be shared with the Amer-
ican people, not just wealthy share-
holders. Does that sound really unrea-
sonable? 
If these guys are going to make huge 
profits based on this investment, don’t 
you think maybe the taxpayers of this 
country who gave them the money 
might be able to get some of those ben-
efits back? 
The microchip industry today is 
worth about $680 billion. By 2030, that 
market, the market for microchips, is 
expected to grow to a trillion dollars. 
Do any of my colleagues really believe 
that if microchip companies make a 
profit as a direct result of these Fed-
eral grants—which is extremely like-
ly—the taxpayers in this country, tax-
payers do not have a right to get a rea-
sonable return on that investment? 
And let us be clear, none of this is a 
radical idea. All of those provisions 
that I just articulated were included in 
the CARES Act that passed the Senate 
by a vote of 96 to 0. In other words, 
every Senator here has already voted 
for these provisions. 
Now, I have heard recently some of 
my colleagues who are saying: Don’t 
worry. We have imposed ‘‘strong guard-
rails’’ to this bill. 
Well, let me respectfully disagree. 
These so-called guardrails would do 
nothing to prevent microchip compa-
nies from outsourcing a single job 
abroad. In fact, these so-called guard-
rails would not even force Intel to di-
vest all of the money they have put 
into 
semiconductor 
companies 
in 
China. These so-called guardrails would 
do nothing to protect taxpayers or to 
stop microchip companies from union 
busting. 
Yes, I understand some language has 
been inserted in this bill that would 
prohibit microchip companies from 
using Federal grants to buy back their 
own stock, but let’s be clear, this lan-
guage is totally meaningless. Under 
this legislation, companies will still be 
able to use the enormous profits that 
they are making to buy back their own 
stocks. 
Bottom line, let us rebuild the U.S. 
microchip industry. I believe that. But 
let us do it in a way that benefits all of 
our society, not just a handful of 
wealthy, profitable, and powerful cor-
porations. 
In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
said: 
The problem is that we all too often have 
socialism for the rich and rugged free enter-
prise capitalism for the poor. 
I am afraid that what Dr. King said 
54 years ago was accurate back then. 
And as we can see by this legislation 
today—massive subsidies for the rich 
and the powerful, while we continue to 
turn our backs on working families— 
what King said then is even more accu-
rate now. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to call up 
amendment No. 5145, that the amend-
ment be considered and agreed to, and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table

nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There is a sufficient second. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I would 
like to be recognized to speak on the 
bill. 
We will soon be moving to a vote on 
the so-called CHIPS legislation. It has 
had several names during its consider-
ation in the Senate and in the House. I 
prefer to call it the CHIPS and Science 
Act. But it is an important bipartisan 
piece of legislation, and I urge its adop-
tion. 
Is my friend from Vermont seeking 
recognition? 
Mr. SANDERS. No. 
Mr. WICKER. So I urge my col-
leagues to vote yes on this legislation. 
It will expand American semiconductor 
production, create new opportunities 
for research into cutting-edge tech-
nologies, and enhance our ability to 
compete with China. 
There is no more important competi-
tion than the one for technological su-
premacy between the United States 
and China. The outcome will shape the 
global balance of power for decades and 
will impact the security and prosperity 
of all Americans. 
Regrettably, at this moment, we are 
not in the driver’s seat on a range of 
important 
technologies; 
China 
is. 
China and other nations are increas-
ingly dominant in tech innovation, 
posing a massive threat to not only our 
economy but to our national security. 
But with today’s vote, Congress has a 
chance to move us back in the right di-
rection and put America back into a 
place to win the game. 
This 
legislation—the 
CHIPS 
and 
Science Act, I will call it—will provide 
a historic boost to our semiconductor 
industry, which for too long has played 
on an uneven global playing field. 
Increasing American chip production 
is absolutely vital, given the impor-
tance of chips to our economy, as well 
as our national defense. The pandemic 
taught us the hard way that we cannot 
be dependent on semiconductor produc-
tion halfway around the globe. 
But, of course, chip semiconductors 
are not the whole ball game. This legis-
lation goes much further, advancing 
American innovation in quantum com-
puting, 
advanced 
robotics, 
bio-
technology, advanced materials, and 
artificial intelligence—the full suite of 
technologies 
that 
we 
need 
to 
outcompete China. 
And instead of limiting those invest-
ments to a small handful of institu-
tions in five wealthy States, this bill 
casts a wide net, enlisting the talent 
and expertise of STEM researchers na-
tionwide. This legislation will guar-
antee that EPSCoR, a program de-
signed to stimulate competitive re-
search 
in 
25 
predominantly 
rural 
States, receives 20 percent of all R&D 
funding from the National Science 
Foundation, up from the current 13 
percent—13 percent now, 20 percent 
when it is finally ramped up. 
The bill will also reauthorize the Na-
tional Science Foundation, the gold 
standard for funding basic research, 
and it will establish a new Directorate 
for Technology, Innovation, and Part-
nerships, called TIP, at NSF to super-
charge the process of translating basic 
research into technology development, 
and then to the commercial market, 
enabling us to compete better with 
China across a vast range of tech-
nologies. 
This legislation would not be com-
plete without new safeguards against 
espionage—which we know is taking 
place right now—against intellectual 
property theft, for which the Chinese 
have become notorious. I am pleased 
we were able to include a number of 
long-overdue reforms to protect the 
fruits of our Nation’s R&D invest-
ments. Even so, there is more work to 
be done to protect American research 
across the whole of government, and I 
commend my friend Senator PORTMAN 
from Ohio for moving forward with his 
initiative, which I hope can be incor-
porated into the statute at some point. 
This moment has been a long time in 
the making, and I want to issue some 
bipartisan congratulations and words 
of thanks. 
My dear friend and colleague from 
the State of Washington, the chair of 
the Commerce Committee, Senator 
CANTWELL, is on the floor, and I con-
gratulate her and commend her and 
thank her for her cooperation with me 
on this issue. 
I want to thank Leader SCHUMER and 
Senator YOUNG, the original cosponsors 
of the Endless Frontier Act, as well as 
Senator CORNYN, Senator SINEMA, and 
many other colleagues who helped 
make this a better bill. 
And I also want to congratulate and 
commend officials from the previous 
administration—from the Trump ad-
ministration—who 
are 
also

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3713 
July 27, 2022 
Americans about the importance of 
this legislation. 
This is a bill that will be signed by 
President Joe Biden, but it is also en-
dorsed 
by 
Ambassador 
Robert 
Lighthizer, President Trump’s Inter-
national 
Trade 
Adviser; 
by 
Mike 
Pompeo, President Trump’s CIA Direc-
tor and Secretary of State; and by Rob-
ert O’Brien, former National Security 
Advisor to President Trump. So three 
distinguished and knowledgeable na-
tional defense officials and foreign pol-
icy officials are saying this about the 
bill we will soon vote on. 
Ambassador Lighthizer, of the Trump 
administration, said on Kudlow 2 days 
ago: 
We are in this existential competition with 
China. The battleground of that competition 
is technology and chips. That is where we 
are going to win it or lose it. 
And he goes on to point out that the 
bill, while not perfect, is exactly the 
bill that we can get done right now, 
and I don’t know of any bill that is 
ever perfect. 
Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, a 
stalwart in the last administration on 
national defense, says this: 
Congress must pass the CHIPS Act for both 
our national and economic security. We have 
to become less dependent on China for crit-
ical technologies—and this is how we do it. 
. . . A bipartisan bill, supporting R&D for 
semiconductor chip manufacturing, is essen-
tial to securing vital technologies for our 
economy and our military. 
That is Mike Pompeo, President 
Trump’s Secretary of State. 
And then Robert O’Brien, former Na-
tional Security Advisor to President 
Trump, said: 
America needs this legislation without 
delay. 
So I want to also say a note of 
thanks to my own staff—my personal 
staff and my committee staff—for their 
tireless efforts over the last year and a 
half on this issue. This is the culmina-
tion of a great deal of work by some 
very, very talented personnel—count-
less meetings, a legislative hearing in 
April, a markup in May, a final vote by 
the Senate in June after days and days 
of debate on the floor. All of these staff 
members worked nights and weekends, 
considering and helping to manage al-
most 1,000 amendments through the 
committee and the floor, and all of 
them contributed in many ways. 
I will single out for recognition my 
policy director, James Mazol, who was 
absolutely vital to us in putting it all 
together, and his entire team. 
So thank you very much, Mr. Presi-
dent. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. I think the 
strong 64 votes we had yesterday on 
cloture was indicative of the support, 
and I anticipate its passage and look 
forward to its successful passage in the 
House of Representatives. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
finish my remarks prior to the sched-
uled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the legislation before us and how it is 
an investment today for jobs tomor-
row. 
And I want to thank my colleague 
from Mississippi for his partnership on 
this legislation. It seems like a century 
ago that we had a markup in com-
mittee and passed this out—the science 
portion, which we are now voting on— 
24 to 4, more than a year ago. And yet 
here we are today, on the product of 
much negotiation, not just in our com-
mittee but in eight other committees— 
seven other committees. 
We are here because we know that in-
novation is in the DNA of Americans, 
and we know that it helped us win the 
world wars; it helped us cure disease. 
We know it has helped create millions 
of jobs, and it has helped members of 
the business community on opposite 
sides of a phone call or an email con-
nect to each other to get a product or 
a service. 
So this bill embraces American inno-
vation and our tradition of it, and I, 
too, encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
After watching the COVID crisis 
mangle our supply chain and see semi-
conductors be a big part of inflation, 
the shortage of semiconductors has in-
creased the cost of a used car by more 
than 40 percent, putting it out of reach 
of many families at a time when they 
just needed a car to drive to work. 
So this bill is about making sure that 
we face our manufacturing challenges 
here at home and that we train and 
skill the scientists and the workers to 
get that done. 
And so thanks start with Senators 
SCHUMER
and YOUNG
for their hard 
work in introducing this legislation 
more than 2 years ago. Senator SCHU-
MER’s great work with Senator YOUNG 
on this was an eye-opening change in 
the way that we make investments in 
R&D. It was a concept novel then, but 
I think we have a lot of understanding 
of it now, and that is to move our R&D 
into faster translation into products 
and services. Why? Because the rest of 
the world is doing that and we need to 
hurry as well. 
I also want to just point out that 
there are lots of contributions from 
Members in this bill: Senator PETERS 
on AI scholarships, Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO on national science technology 
strategy, Senator ROSEN
on critical 
minerals, Senator SINEMA on our NASA 
authorization, Senator WARNOCK
on 
semiconductor supply chains, Senators 
BROWN and COONS on Manufacturing 
USA Institutes, Senator OSSOFF
on 
cyber security education grants, Sen-
ator MENENDEZ on supply chain issues. 
So many, many things in this legisla-
tion were contributed by many dif-
ferent Members through a regular 
order process. 
But let’s get specific about it. There 
are about five or six things in this bill 
that really matter to our Nation at 
this critical moment. 
First is a new mission at the Na-
tional Science Foundation. That new 
mission is different because the Na-
tional Science Foundation has been fo-
cused on basic research. So we are cre-
ating, for the first time, in a $20 billion 
investment over 5 years, the focus for 
that new mission at NSF to say that 
they have to focus on translating that 
science into faster discoveries in prod-
ucts and solutions that will help U.S. 
manufacturing here at home. 
And while the United States has ex-
celled at basic research, we have al-
lowed other countries to excel at 
translational research, and that needs 
to stop now. 
We need to make the investment in 
industries from aerospace to pharma-
ceuticals, to farming, to information 
technologies that will help increase the 
pace of innovation here in the United 
States of America. 
Second, we say that NSF is not alone 
in its mission. We recognize that the 
Department of Energy also has a key 
role to play in translational science. 
I want to thank the Presiding Offi-
cer, Senator LUJA´ N, for his contribu-
tion of a $16.9 billion DOE investment 
that doubles down on the current work 
in key technology areas that we also 
have to do faster translational science 
to scale up in cutting edge energy 
R&D. This was a very large portion of 
the energy innovation that was funded 
in this bill. 
This legislation also includes a 5- 
year, $50 billion, first-ever reauthoriza-
tion of the Department of Energy Of-
fice of Science. And I want to thank 
Senators MANCHIN and BARRASSO for 
working on this and its inclusion in 
this. 
Combining these investments will go 
a long way in reversing the decline in 
Federal R&D that has dropped three- 
fold since 1978. We need to improve U.S. 
competitiveness, but we are only going 
to do it by investing today for those 
jobs tomorrow. 
Third, the bill also says that we need 
to be smarter at how we make our in-
vestments. Now, I would say I rep-
resent a tech hub. It is already in exist-
ence. It took 30-plus years to create. 
There are places like Seattle, San Jose, 
San Francisco, Boston, and San Diego 
that you could say are tech hubs. They 
account for 90 percent of the growth in 
innovation sectors between the years 
2005 and 2017. But is that all we are 
going to do in the United States of 
America, allow innovation to just con-
tinue to be more and more expensive 
because it is only produced in those 
areas? 
I am a firm believer in distributed 
generation, whether that is electricity 
or whether that is innovation. And the 
more dispersed the innovation is, you 
never know where the next Bill Gates 
or Bill Boeing is going to be from and 
what innovation they might come up 
with. 
So this bill also has a new mission in 
the Department of Commerce in tech-
nology hubs, where it will focus on try-
ing to foster new collaboration between

universities, 
businesses, 
labor, 
and 
local government to accelerate eco-
nomic growth and opportunity in inno-
vation. These tech hubs will focus on 
the key technology areas that are in 
this bill and help us move faster at in-
novation. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator TESTER, from Montana, who is a 
very big advocate in making sure that 
there was geographic diversity to the 
tech hubs. And we know that while we 
want to grow more technology ad-
vancement in the United States, that 
we also want to see it not just in Se-
attle, but in places like Spokane or In-
dianapolis or West Virginia or Wichita. 
We also increase in this Act the Man-
ufacturing 
Extension 
Partnerships. 
During the pandemic, we saw that 
many companies could not survive 
without supplies that were no longer 
available to them. And we know that 
with the manufacturing extension eco-
system, that we have to stay competi-
tive by innovating. This bill delivers 
$76 billion over 10 years to develop the 
next generation of chips and to rees-
tablish chip manufacturing in the 
United States. 
Now I know my colleague from 
Vermont and my colleague from Flor-
ida and many others have criticized 
this part of the legislation. I know that 
they think that this is somehow—I 
wish, trust me, I wish that—I would 
probably agree more with the Senator 
of Vermont on the prioritization with-
in our budget on the various things 
that will help American families. But 
we can’t ignore that chip production 
has gone overseas and that the United 
States has lost its share of that pro-
duction to the point that we are now 
down to as little as 12 percent—or 
could go to 12 percent, at which point, 
who wants to manufacture when the 
ecosystem is somewhere else? We know 
that just last year alone, chip short-
ages cost the U.S. economy $240 billion. 
That is the automobile industry that 
didn’t have chips; that is part of the 
electronics industry that didn’t have 
chips. You can say it is even in the cost 
of every product that you buy because 
we certainly didn’t produce the trans-
portation system to even move prod-
ucts throughout the United States in 
companies like PACCAR that are from 
the Northwest, because they too did 
not have chips to put into their trailers 
to move products across the United 
States. So we know that with every 
dollar of chip R&D investment, that in-
creases GDP gains by $16.50. 
So I know my colleagues would like 
us to make other investments, but I 
would say that chips are just as essen-
tial as wheat is in America. People 
think about our farm investments and 
with no hesitation say: Let’s make 
sure that we keep wheat production in 
the United States of America. I guar-
antee you, chips are no less important. 
And we have to have an increase in the 
United States, or we are going to con-
tinue to fall behind on national secu-
rity issues and on economic develop-
ment issues that are so critical. 
We also, in this legislation, make one 
of the most significant investments in 
STEM over the last many years. It 
puts $13 billion into science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics 
workforce development. It creates $2 
billion to minority-serving institu-
tions, including Native American insti-
tutions, to encourage their research 
and innovation. 
And I want to thank Senator WICKER 
for his leadership on the F-score provi-
sion, probably one of the more hotly 
debated conversations between our col-
leagues here in the Senate and in the 
House. But I would say to my col-
leagues, this is about innovation every-
where. This is about growing oppor-
tunity everywhere. And that is exactly 
what we are saying with F-score. You 
never know what the next innovation 
is going to bring. 
So these key provisions, from diversi-
fying our investment in education and 
job training, from making investments 
in tech hubs, to the investment in R&D 
by both DOD and NSF through faster 
translational science, we are improving 
the ecosystem that we have in the 
United States of America. This eco-
system has been built over a long pe-
riod of time. It represents competing 
and collaborating organizations. That 
is what the strength of our R&D is. 
So I want to thank Senators SCHU-
MER and YOUNG, Senators CORNYN and 
KELLY, and many other people who 
helped introduce and move this legisla-
tion. I want to thank Senator WARNER 
for his contributions and thank, again, 
Senator WICKER and his team for the 
many advances in this legislation. I 
also would be remiss if I didn’t thank 
retiring Chair EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
and Ranking Member FRANK
LUCAS 
who worked hard to craft the legisla-
tion before us. 
I want to thank on my staff: Lila 
Helms, Melissa Porter, Mary Guenther, 
Amit 
Ronen, 
Stacy 
Baird, 
Nikki 
Teutschel, Christi Barnhart, Jonny 
Pellish, Rosemary Baize, Erica Hol-
man, and Emma Stohlman for their 
help; and on Senator WICKER’s staff, as 
he already mentioned, James Mazol 
and many other people. I want to 
thank on Senator SCHUMER’s staff Jon 
Cardinal, Mike Kuiken, and Meghan 
Taira for their hard work. But no one 
deserves more focus and attention than 
Richard-Duane 
Chambers 
from 
my 
staff, who literally worked on the last 
COMPETES bill and then worked at 
DARPA, so clearly knows seriously the 
challenges that we faced in getting this 
legislation done and getting it over the 
goal line. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
this important legislation. We don’t 
know exactly what innovations will 
come out of this, but we do know this: 
America will be more competitive be-
cause of it. And we do know this: that 
we will be able to grow our economy 
for the future because of the invest-
ments that we have made today. 
I yield the floor.

will protect America’s national secu-
rity interests. 
All too often, our government and 
our businesses are accused of being too 
short term, but this is one of the most 
significant long-term thinking bills we 
have passed in a very long time. I told 
our caucus yesterday that our grand-
children will hold good-paying jobs in 
industries we can’t even imagine be-
cause of what we are doing right now. 
And we did it together, both sides co-
operating in good faith on some truly 
difficult issues. I want to thank my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
their superb work on this legislation: 
my colleague Senator YOUNG, with 
whom I originally authored the Endless 
Frontier Act, as well as Senator CANT-
WELL, our conference chair, and Sen-
ators WICKER and WARNER and CORNYN 
and KELLY. I also want to thank Sen-
ators WARNOCK, BROWN, and SINEMA for 
their help and Leader MCCONNELL for 
his support as well as all members of 
the conference committee and all the 
individual Senators—just about every 
one of us—who helped shape this legis-
lation. These are moments when the 
Senate is at its very best. 
This is going to go down as one of the 
major bipartisan achievements of this 
Congress, along with the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act and the re-
cent gun safety law. The American peo-
ple deserve to see more examples like 
this, of both sides coming together to 
do very, very big things that will leave 
a lasting impact on our country. 
And I am confident that future gen-
erations will look back on the passage 
of this bill as a turning point for Amer-
ican leadership in the 21st century. 
And we are paying attention to all of 
America. We are making sure tech 
hubs will be located not just in the big, 
big megalopolises like San Francisco 
or New York City or Boston but in 
places like Buffalo and Syracuse and 
Rochester 
and 
Indianapolis 
and 
Omaha—not just major cities. 
For decades, it was America’s fierce 
commitment to scientific research, 
technological growth, and advanced 
manufacturing that made us the envy 
of the world. That funding that we put 
into science created the greatest lab-
oratories, split the atom, spliced the 
gene, landed a man on the Moon, and 
unleashed the internet. We generated 
decades of American prosperity and 
fostered an innate sense of optimism in 
the American spirit. And we made the 
world a safer, more hospitable place for 
our democratic values. 
Today, we face the great task of re-
newing and strengthening that spirit in 
this century, in a world of fierce com-
petition and hungry authoritarians. It 
is no longer the case where we can just 
leave it up to corporate America. Now 
there are nation-states and authori-
tarian governments funding and aiding 
these corporations to come to their 
shores. 
Authoritarian 
nations 
are 
cheering for us to fail, hoping we sit on 
our hands and fail to adapt to the 
changes of the 21st century. 
We dare not cede the mantle of global 
leadership on our watch. We dare not 
permit America to become a middling 
nation in the middle of this century. 
No, we mean for America to lead this 
century. We mean for America to pros-
per and grow just as we have done 
throughout history. It won’t happen on 
its own, but today we are laying the 
foundation for a bold and thriving fu-
ture. Today, by passing this CHIPS and 
Science bill, we are making clear that 
we believe America’s best days are yet 
to come.

CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. KELLY. Mr. President, just a few 
minutes ago, after a year and a half of 
work, we have finally—finally—passed 
our plan to boost microchip manufac-
turing in the United States. 
Microchips go in nearly everything 
we use. They are in the TV or the cell 
phone that folks are watching this on, 
and they are in lifesaving medical de-
vices, and they are in our most ad-
vanced weapons systems. 
The 
United 
States 
invented 
microchips, and, once, we produced 40 
percent of the world’s supply. Today, 
we only produce about 12 percent, and 
we don’t produce any of the most ad-
vanced microchips. 
Now, that leaves us vulnerable to dis-
ruptions in the supply chain, like the 
current microchip shortage that has 
halted production lines and driven up 
prices. 
If you have recently tried to buy a 
car—a new car—and waited months or 
paid more than you were expecting, the 
microchip shortage is a big reason why. 
So we have worked on a plan, Repub-
licans and Democrats, with incentives 
to make sure the world’s leading 
microchip manufacturers grow their 
operations here in the United States 
instead of in China or Europe. It also 
boosts research so that the most ad-
vanced chips in the world are invented 
and produced right here in the United 
States. That will mean tens of thou-
sands of new jobs in places like Ari-
zona, which is already a microchip hub, 
poised to grow as Intel and the Taiwan 
Semiconductor 
Manufacturing 
Com-
pany expand and build new manufac-
turing facilities. 
That is all made possible by this leg-
islation, and it creates jobs, not just 
with those companies but also with the 
companies that supply them the tools 
and packaging for their products. And 
these are great-paying jobs, and many

of them do not require a four-year de-
gree. 
I visited Estrella Mountain Commu-
nity College just several weeks ago, 
where they are training Arizonans to 
enter the semiconductor technician ca-
reer track with just a 10-day course fol-
lowed by a guaranteed job interview. 
Now, this is an enormous opportunity 
to reinvent our economy for the future, 
and this week, we are getting it done. 
This bill has now passed the Senate, 
and I am confident that it will pass the 
House and be signed into law. 
While this process has been long, it 
has also shown what we can accomplish 
when we work together, Republicans 
and Democrats. 
Senators YOUNG, CORNYN, WARNER, 
and I first began working on this at the 
beginning of last year, we found agree-
ment, and we worked to build support 
from our colleagues. Since then, we 
have had to overcome more than a few 
roadblocks, but what matters most is 
that we got this done. As a result, our 
country is going to once again be a 
leader in microchip manufacturing, 
creating tens of thousands of great- 
paying jobs, strengthening our na-
tional security, and lowering costs for 
everyday products.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, shortly, 
I will ask unanimous consent on the 
nomination of Dimitri Kusnezov to be 
the Under Secretary for Science and 
Technology 
at 
the 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security. 
The Department needs qualified and 
steady leadership to support its 240,000 
employees and their critical missions 
to protect our homeland security and 
to keep Americans safe. The Direc-
torate of Science and Technology plays 
a vital role in carrying out these re-
sponsibilities as the Department’s re-
search and development arm, con-
ducting groundbreaking research to 
help our Nation identify vulnerabilities 
in our homeland security so that we 
can close existing gaps and increase 
our capacity to address both current 
and emerging threats. 
Dr. Kusnezov is more than qualified 
to lead these efforts. He most recently 
served as the Deputy Under Secretary 
for Artificial Intelligence and Tech-
nology at the Department of Energy, 
where he led the efforts to drive artifi-
cial intelligence innovation by incor-
porating it into their missions and op-
erations, including through the cre-
ation of a new Artificial Intelligence 
Office. 
After more than a decade on the Yale 
faculty as a professor of theoretical 
physics, Dr. Kusnezov left academia to 
pursue public service at the Depart-
ment of Energy and became a member 
of the Senior Executive Service. He 
served as a senior adviser to the U.S. 
Secretary of Energy and Chief Sci-
entist for the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration. 
Throughout the confirmation proc-
ess, Dr. Kusnezov has demonstrated he 
possesses the technical and specialized 
expertise to serve in this role, and I 
urge my colleagues to confirm Dr. 
Kusnezov. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate consider the fol-
lowing nomination: Calendar No. 727, 
Dimitri Kusnezov to be Under Sec-
retary for Science and Technology, De-
partment of Homeland Security; that 
the nomination be confirmed without 
intervening action or debate; that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s actions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, this nominee 
has been failed by the bureaucracy that 
he attempts to join. 
For months, I have been working 
with the State Department and the De-
partment 
of 
Homeland 
Security— 
USCIS specifically—to rectify an egre-
gious immigration case. 
A North Dakota family, an American 
family, is being forced to live apart 
from each other after one of the par-
ents, a Canadian, inadvertently over-
stayed their visa after receiving poor 
advice during the chaos of the COVID 
pandemic. This forced separation has 
been ongoing since last year. In fact, 
the Canadian citizen, the Canadian 
mother, is barred for 10 years from re-
turning to her home. 
The family has complied with every 
request our government has thrown at 
them and, as we speak, are working on 
fulfilling another dilatory and unneces-
sary request for more information. 
The review of this case could have 
been done a long time ago, but instead 
bureaucrats are expediting nothing, 
stringing out request after request, ac-
tually forcing my constituent to prove 
the hardship of being separated and 
even show why moving to Canada 
would be a problem. Think of it. Their 
own government is asking them to jus-
tify why they can’t just move to Can-
ada. They are past the point of exas-
peration, and I don’t know how we can 
blame them. 
It is wrong and unjust, especially 
when my constituents witness the 
same Agency allowing thousands of 
people to pour across our southern bor-
der without a scintilla of review every 
single day. 
The government is not without fault 
in this case, and I could share many 
more frustrating details of their saga, 
but I will refrain for the sake of their 
privacy as they work through this 
grueling process. However, my holds on 
DHS nominees will remain until this 
case is resolved. And I will add, if there 
is no meaningful change soon, these 
holds will expand to other Agencies 
that are involved in this case—specifi-
cally, the State Department. 
It is not a decision I make lightly 
and one I would rather not make at all, 
but I would like to state the obvious: It 
shouldn’t take a U.S. Senator person-
ally calling Agencies and the adminis-
tration while holding up nominees to 
get the so-called public servants to ac-
tually serve the public. 
Get this done. 
With that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I renew 
my above request except that I ask 
unanimous consent that the vote occur 
at a time to be determined by the ma-
jority leader, in consultation with the 
Republican leader; that there be 10 
minutes for debate equally divided in 
the usual form on the nomination; that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate vote without intervening 
action or debate on the nomination and 
the Senate resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I would be 
happy to have a vote on this this after-
noon. But the decision isn’t mine; it is 
the bureaucrats at DHS. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
every day, I receive messages from 
Michigan families who are struggling 
to cope with rising costs for the things 
they depend on. We know that it has 
been challenging in a global pandemic 
with supply chains broken down and 
consolidation, but we also know that 
from food prices to household neces-
sities to gas, corporate price gouging is 
also taking a big chunk out of Michi-
gan wallets. And perhaps no industry 
has been price-gouging longer—actu-
ally for decades—more deeply than the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
Americans pay the highest prices in 
the world for prescription drugs—high-
est prices in the world—even though we 
are the ones who have invested so 
much partnering with the industry on 
new types of medications and innova-
tions. We allow research and develop-
ment tax credits to help pay for that 
cost. We support other efforts. The Na-
tional Institutes of Health helps to pay 
for the basic research, hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars working with the indus-
try. And yet we have the highest prices 
in the world—the highest prices in the 
world. And one in four Americans can’t 
afford the medications they depend on. 
This is just not acceptable. It is just 
not acceptable. 
A senior with complex medical needs 
pays an average of more than $6,000 a 
year on prescription drugs. And the 
median price for a new prescription 
drug is $188,000 a year. That is 90 times 
the median price for a new drug just

back in 2008. And that is more than 
most Americans earn in 3 years, not 
just 1 year, but in 3 years. 
Christina of Center Line, MI, knows 
this. She was prescribed Humira for an 
autoimmune condition that affects her 
eyes. Unfortunately, even though she 
needs it, she can’t afford it. The medi-
cation 
costs 
more 
than 
$6,000 
a 
month—a month. She wrote this: 
Autoimmune patients . . . struggle with 
the cost of prescriptions being so high and 
some just give up and don’t even bother. 
That should never be an option in my opin-
ion. 
James, who lives in Manistee, suffers 
from narcolepsy. It is a neurological 
condition in which patients can sud-
denly fall asleep during other activi-
ties, including eating or driving. I am 
sure we have all known someone or 
seen someone who has this disease. 
James first started taking medica-
tion called Xyrem in 2015. Back then, it 
cost about $9,000 a month. Today, that 
same 
medication 
costs 
more 
than 
$18,000 a month—$18,000 a month, or 
$226,221.84 a year. 
Who can do that? Who can do that? 
Last year, James’ doctor switched 
him to a slightly different drug with 
less sodium, produced by the same 
company, Jazz Pharmaceuticals. The 
new drug, XYWAV, costs even more— 
$239,000—$239,320, to be specific, per 
year. 
James writes: 
Who is profiting from these huge price 
hikes? Will these huge price hikes continue 
every year? Does Jazz Pharmaceuticals have 
enough oversight? Are they putting profits 
over people? 
I think there is an answer to that. It 
sure seems like that to me, James. 
There is no fundamental reason for 
these prices to be going up and up and 
up. Now, when I think about insulin, 
which has tripled in price in the last 
decade or so, this was a drug that was 
actually discovered 100 years ago by 
two Canadian doctors who developed 
this patent for lifesaving medicine, and 
because they felt it was unethical to 
actually be making a profit off of 
something that would help people, they 
gave it to the University of Toronto for 
the equivalent of $1. 
That was 100 years ago. It hasn’t sub-
stantially changed as a product in 100 
years. The company has more than re-
covered their research and develop-
ment—their costs and so on. And yet in 
the last couple of years, the price has 
tripled—tripled. If that is not a sign of 
price gouging, I don’t know what is. 
From 2000 to 2018, big pharmaceutical 
companies raked in $11.5 trillion in rev-
enue. That is T—trillion dollars. Be-
tween 2016 and 2020, drug companies 
spent $577 billion on stock buybacks— 
not lowering prices, but doing more for 
their CEOs and doing more for their 
stockholders. The $577 billion on stock 
buybacks is about 10 times as much as 
they spent on research and develop-
ment. 
They also have significantly in-
creased executive compensation while 
Americans struggle to afford lifesaving 
medications. For the record, the CEO 
of Jazz Pharmaceuticals made more 
than $16 million in total compensation 
last year; an awful lot of Michigan 
families could live a good life on that 
one salary. 
The pharmaceutical and health prod-
ucts industry spent $350 million on lob-
bying in 2021, nearly double the spend-
ing of the second-highest industry. In 
fact, at one point—I haven’t done this 
recently, but at one point, I looked at 
the number of lobbyists per Senator, 
and it was 15 lobbyists in the drug in-
dustry for every one Senator. And so 
we wonder, what is going on here? And 
then we see what happens in elections 
and so on; and, unfortunately, our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who receive a lot of the benefits of the 
contributions from the pharmaceutical 
industry then come to the floor and try 
to block us from doing something on 
behalf of people to lower these prices. 
And that is going to be what is hap-
pening again next week. 
So far in 2022, pharmaceutical compa-
nies have already raised the price of 
1,186 drugs, and they raised the price on 
100 drugs just this—right now in July, 
this month—100 drugs. Prices have 
gone up, just this year. 
It is appalling. There is no other 
word for it. And while Republican col-
leagues are fighting to protect these 
absurd profits, Senate Democrats are 
fighting for people who need their 
medicines, in some cases just to sur-
vive, to live, or to be able to go to 
work, to be able to do things to support 
their children to get what they need. 
Our commonsense plan, which we 
will be voting on next week, to lower 
drug prices will save $288 billion over 
the next 10 years. First, it would em-
power Medicare to negotiate prescrip-
tion drug prices beginning with 10 of 
the highest costing drugs, starting 
next year. I can’t believe it. We nego-
tiate everything else, and we know the 
VA that negotiates on behalf of vet-
erans’ prescription drugs gets about 40 
percent less. Common sense tells you 
that we should be negotiating these 
prices. 
But, unfortunately, years ago, when 
the prescription drug bill, Part B, 
passed in Medicare, the drug companies 
were successful in getting specific lan-
guage in that says you can’t negotiate 
with them. Medicare cannot negotiate. 
Well, that needs to change, and we are 
going to change that. 
So it would be 10 of the highest cost-
ing drugs next year that would expand 
to 20 drugs in each year after that by 
2029. Just imagine how much money 
can be saved if Medicare was allowed to 
negotiate, and it would directly benefit 
people who are living with conditions 
including asthma, blood clots, COPD, 
as well as cancers as well as a whole 
range of things—everything you can 
imagine. 
Secondly, our legislation caps Medi-
care beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket costs 
for seniors, for people with disabilities 
on Medicare. We will cap the out-of- 
pocket costs to $2,000 a year and allow 
people to spread that out over the year 
so that it is easier to make that pay-
ment. So instead of $6,000 a month or 
$9,000 a month or $10,000 a month or 
whatever, we are talking about a cap of 
$2,000 you can spread out over the year 
in out-of-pocket costs for seniors and 
people with disabilities. Never again 
will a diagnosis like cancer mean 
$10,000 or more for a single drug to 
treat it. 
Medicare beneficiaries would also re-
ceive free vaccines, including vaccines 
for shingles. That currently costs sen-
iors $190 if they are not enrolled in 
Medicare Part B. It would increase help 
for 
low-income 
seniors, 
giving 
all 
qualifying Medicare beneficiaries the 
full low-income subsidy under Medi-
care Part B. So we would help low-in-
come seniors even more. That would 
save the average senior about $5,000. 
That is a lot of money. And it would 
keep Part B premiums in Medicare af-
fordable for seniors and people with 
disabilities and ensuring that pre-
miums won’t increase because of bad 
actions by drug companies, and that 
means not faster than inflation. Speak-
ing of bad actions by drug companies, 
it would penalize them for outrageous 
price increases. If they go above infla-
tion, they are going to have to rebate 
those funds. 
Today, 
drug 
companies 
are 
incentivized by keeping drug prices 
high by secretly negotiating with in-
surers and pharmacy benefit managers 
to increase profits at the expense of pa-
tients. Under our legislation, drug 
companies, not consumers, will be on 
the hook for drug price hikes that ex-
ceed the rate of inflation. This proposal 
alone is expected to save Medicare $71 
billion. 
For far too long, the drug companies 
have been taking advantage of people 
like 
Christina 
and 
James. 
People 
should not have to go without the med-
icine they need in this country, in 
America, where we fund through our 
tax dollars so much of the innovation 
that creates these drugs. They should 
not be forced to skip doses or take less 
than what was prescribed to save 
money, and they should not have to 
choose between taking their medicine 
and keeping the lights on or putting 
food on the table. 
Christina and James deserve better. 
Americans deserve better. And we are 
going to fight until that gets done. 
That is what next week is all about on 
prescription drugs. It is time. It is past 
time. People deserve to be able to af-
ford the medicine they need. It is time 
to put people before profits, and that is 
exactly what we are going to do.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. THOMAS E. DOBBS, III 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
rise to express deep appreciation for 
Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. 
Thomas Dobbs, a friend and leader to 
all of the frontline healthcare workers 
in my State. 
Dr. Dobbs joined the Mississippi 
State Department of Health as the 
State health officer in December 2018. 
After 31⁄2 years and a global pandemic 
that none of us saw coming, he will 
soon step down from his role and re-
turn to the clinical side of medicine. 
Mississippi’s State health officer is 
responsible for directing public health 
activities related to the State’s many 
health challenges, which included my 
State’s response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Dr. Dobbs’ experience and his exper-
tise made him the perfect professional 
to lead Mississippi through this pan-
demic. With a belief that each person 
in Mississippi was his patient, Dr. 
Dobbs worked tirelessly throughout his 
tenure to care for our nearly 3 million 
residents. From the start, Dr. Dobbs 
was steadfast in informing and advis-
ing 
citizens, 
policymakers, 
and 
healthcare providers on the best prac-
tices to combat the deadly coronavirus. 
He never wavered despite evolving 
challenges and so many tragic COVID- 
related deaths. 
He is one of the country’s most re-
spected public health officers, having 
earned a stellar reputation for his clin-
ical work in the field of infectious dis-
eases. Dr. Thomas Dobbs proved him-
self to be the leader Mississippi needed 
during a very difficult time. I am sad-
dened to see Dr. Dobbs leave the Mis-
sissippi State Department of Health, 
but I am confident he will continue to 
do great things. 
There are not enough thanks in the 
world that could cover all that Dr. 
Dobbs has done for Mississippi, but I 
say from the bottom of my heart, 
thank you, Dr. Dobbs. Your service and 
sacrifice on behalf of Mississippi re-
flects well on you and your profession. 
I am also grateful for his wife, Dr. 
Kim Dobbs, and their two sons, Wyn 
and Max, for sharing so much of their 
husband and father during this time. 
As Dr. Dobbs departs the State de-
partment of health, I look forward to 
continuing to work with him and the 
new State health officer, Dr. Dan 
Edney, in making Mississippi healthier 
and happier. 
Thank you again so much, Dr. Dobbs. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa. 
INFLATION 
Ms. 
ERNST. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
mountain Americans have to climb to 
make ends meet keeps getting steeper 
and steeper as a result of Bidenomics. 
Since President Biden began his 
reckless tax-and-spending spree, prices 
are sky-high for gas, food, housing, and 
just about everything else. The admin-
istration’s own statistics reveal infla-
tion jumped nearly 10 percent in the 
last year, the biggest increase in over 
four decades. 
Democrats keep telling us not to 
worry and that the problem is only 
‘‘temporary.’’ Yet, every month, prices 
keep climbing and climbing and climb-
ing. The reason is simple: President 
Biden’s fiscal policies are driving costs 
higher and higher. 
You may recall I came to the Senate 
floor a year ago to warn my colleagues 
that Bidenomics was causing inflation 
to spin out of control. Yet Democrats 
have ignored the struggles being in-
flicted on hard-working Americans and 
continue to pass one trillion-dollar bill 
after another. As reckless spending in-
creased, the value of the dollar de-
clined, meaning paychecks aren’t going 
nearly as far as they did just a year 
ago. 
To make matters even worse, the 
Biden administration’s ongoing effort 
to end domestic oil and gas production 
is fueling the elevated price at the 
pump, which reached an alltime high of 
more than $5 per gallon this summer; 
and an internal analysis by the Biden 
administration’s own Treasury Depart-
ment forecasts that, this fall, gas 
prices could top $6 a gallon. 
I am already hearing from Iowans 
and Iowa businesses about how folks 
aren’t even able to afford to drive to 
work. The problem is becoming even 
more difficult since Bidenomics is driv-
ing up the sticker prices on cars to 
record highs. The actual retail price for 
a new vehicle is $48,000, and if that 
sounds like a lot, the cost of buying a 
home has also reached an alltime high 
of $416,000. It is no surprise fewer peo-
ple are buying homes. Then look at 
rent. It has also hit a record high of 
nearly $1,900 a month. These unpredict-
able prices have everyone asking them-
selves if ‘‘The Price is Right.’’ 
Folks, Americans shouldn’t have to 
play guessing games about whether or 
not their paychecks can be stretched 
far enough to avoid going over a finan-
cial cliff. Each bill the Democrats have 
passed as part of the Biden agenda has 
increased costs for working Americans 
while moving our Nation closer and 
closer to the edge of the fiscal cliff. 
Consider that when Joe Biden was in-
augurated as President in January 2021, 
the inflation rate was only 1 percent. 
After their so-called COVID relief bill— 
which cost $1.9 trillion—was passed in 
March of last year, the inflation rate 
moved up to nearly 3 percent. 
In July, President Biden claimed the 
quickly increasing prices were ‘‘tem-
porary’’ and that his big spending plans 
would result in lower prices for Ameri-
cans, but by the time the President 
signed his $1 trillion, so-called infra-
structure bill in November, inflation 
had climbed to almost 7 percent. 
In December, President Biden said in-
flation had reached its ‘‘peak.’’ He was 
wrong once again, and, today, inflation 
is more than 9 percent. 
This isn’t a cliffhanger, folks. We all 
know where this is headed. Step by 
step, President Biden’s reckless tax- 
and-spend policies are taking us closer 
and closer to going over the cliff, and 
yet the Democrats are still trying to 
outbid each other with another tril-
lion-dollar, 
budget-busting, 
partisan 
package that would raise taxes on 
small businesses and increase prices for 
everyone. 
That is right, folks. Bidenomics is 
driving up the costs of everything, and 
the Democrats’ solution is to spend 
even more of your hard-earned money 
to pay for more of their pricey, par-
tisan 
pet 
projects. 
Any 
more 
Bidenomics will push the economy over 
the fiscal cliff and into a recession. 
It is time to take a step back and 
stop the wasteful Washington spending, 
which is the only way to make these 
prices come on down. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Missouri. 
HEALTHCARE 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I just 
was able to watch the administration 
climb the inflation rate cliff, and I 
want to talk more about this problem 
of what happens when the administra-
tion ignores the warning signs that are 
going to produce the kind of results 
that they have produced. 
You know, Democrats, all by them-
selves, after five bipartisan bills the 
year before to try to fight COVID and 
save the economy, decided that the re-
covering economy needed even more 
help to recover and passed a $1.9 tril-
lion spending bill in March of last year. 
And that money almost immediately 
went out. 
You know, we talk about $1.9 trillion. 
I don’t even know quite how we com-
pare that in a way that people can 
think about it. The normal annual 
spending for the whole discretionary 
budget is $1.47 trillion. So in one bill, 
in addition to the money that the gov-
ernment would be spending that year 
in the budget that we vote on—the dis-
cretionary budget we vote on—Demo-
crats decided: We are going to spend 
that much and more. We are not going 
to spend just twice the normal discre-
tionary spending. We are going to 
spend twice the normal discretionary 
spending plus another 25 percent or so. 
You know, we spend every year about 
700, and last year we spent $780 trillion 
to defend the country. That is a third 
of the money, roughly, in the $2 tril-
lion American Recovery Act. We spent 
less than $700 billion to do everything 
else that we vote on. All of the debates 
we have here about spending are spend-
ing that results in a little less than $1.5 
trillion of spending that is part of the 
normal budget. 
So when you double that and then 
you add to the doubling of that, and 
you put all of that into the economy at 
one time, you are clearly going to cre-
ate a situation where you have infla-
tion. 
That is what Democrats in previous 
administrations, like Clinton’s Sec-
retary of the Treasury and people in

S3719 
July 27, 2022 
the Obama administration, all said— 
that this will create runaway inflation. 
But if that wasn’t enough, we hear that 
they want to spend even more. 
But over the next year, after they 
passed that bill, inflation kept sky-
rocketing. Cracks kept appearing in 
the economy. There were plenty of 
warning signs, but our colleagues on 
the other side kept pushing to write 
the biggest check they possibly could 
and to write another one. 
Their 
latest 
plan 
is 
a 
massive 
amount of government spending. This 
one will be really focused on the Af-
fordable Care Act, sometimes called 
ObamaCare. Apparently, the Affordable 
Care Act wasn’t all that affordable or 
isn’t all that affordable, because if you 
believe the reason for this bill, almost 
nobody can afford it. If you don’t get 
insurance 
at 
work, 
it 
is 
almost 
unaffordable. 
In the original healthcare law, there 
were government subsidies for people 
who didn’t make much money so that 
they could afford to be in what turned 
out to be an overpriced system. But 
that law capped how much you could 
earn and still get a subsidy. 
The $2 trillion I talked about earlier, 
the reckless tax-and-spending spree 
from March of last year, got rid of 
those income limits. Apparently, the 
income limits—no matter how high 
they were—weren’t high enough. So 
they eliminated the income limits. 
Now the amount you would get from 
the government would be based on how 
big a share of your income you were 
spending on insurance, no matter how 
big that income was. 
One study found that a typical fam-
ily of four making $106,000 would al-
most immediately—and did almost im-
mediately—get almost $10,000 in sub-
sidies. Before that, they got zero in 
subsidies. Four hundred percent of the 
poverty level appeared to be enough in 
the original bill. That is the system 
that should have provided insurance 
that people could afford, but, appar-
ently, it hasn’t done that. 
The insurance on the government ex-
changes is so expensive in some areas 
that people making half a million dol-
lars or more could qualify for thou-
sands of dollars from the government 
under this new structure. This, by the 
way, is the structure that the next 
spending bill is supposed to be trying 
to make permanent or at least perma-
nent enough that people will get so 
used to having it that they will never 
want to give it back. 
The bill was called the American 
Rescue Plan. Its supporters kept tell-
ing us it had to be big because there 
were still people in real need and the 
economy was struggling. But we now 
know that while there are always peo-
ple in need, it is not because the econ-
omy is struggling. Now people are in 
need because the economy is spiraling 
out of control, and whether it is at the 
gas pump or the grocery store, you are 
having to make decisions you wouldn’t 
have thought you would have to make. 
The health insurance subsidies in 
particular were meant to be tem-
porary—at least if you believed the 
reason that was given when that bill 
was passed—and would only last until 
the end of this year. Now our friends 
across the aisle want to make these 
temporary subsidies permanent. 
For purposes of the law itself, they 
don’t want to admit that. So they say: 
Well, we just want to extend this year 
for another couple of years. 
And, by the way, I think we are clear 
that when we get to the next deadline, 
once you have had these subsidies for 1 
year, as it turns out—let alone 2 or 3 
more—the whole idea is to get people 
so committed to getting this money 
that the government will never back 
up and take it away. 
It is just a budget gimmick—every-
body knows that—a gimmick to extend 
the program to further redistribute 
taxpayer money to people who are 
making big incomes but have decided 
it is better for the government to pay 
for their insurance than it is to pay for 
their insurance themselves. 
This doesn’t relate to everybody. In 
fact, the 400 percent of poverty, which 
many people thought at the time, and 
still think, sounds like an income 
where you ought to be able to pay your 
own insurance—and, if you can’t, there 
must be something wrong with the 
healthcare system. In fact, last year, 
my colleague from West Virginia, Sen-
ator MANCHIN, said he had serious prob-
lems with another version of this bill 
because there wasn’t a cap. He said: 
‘‘What I see are shell games—budget 
gimmicks that make the real cost of 
the so-called $1.75 trillion bill esti-
mated to be almost twice that’’ much 
during the full time of the bill. 
So the Congressional Budget Office 
looked into this health insurance study 
plan or subsidy plan. They found that 
when it actually gets extended, this ex-
tension over 10 years costs another $250 
billion. If we have people who are mak-
ing more than 400 percent of poverty— 
in fact, if we have people who are un-
limited in their income—who somehow 
need to have government help to buy 
insurance, we ought to figure out what 
happened with the insurance market-
place that ObamaCare created. 
The CBO, the Congressional Budget 
Office, figured that $36 million of that 
$250 million would go to people who 
make more than 400 percent of poverty, 
which works out to be about $140,000 
for a family of 4. They also say that 48 
percent of the new people entering the 
program would be making more income 
than that $140,000 level. 
Even if you think someone who 
makes 
$140,000 
is 
low 
income—as 
maybe our friends on the other side of 
the aisle do—and deserves a handout 
from taxpayers to buy their insurance, 
again, I would say there must be some-
thing wrong with the insurance plan. If 
we have an affordable healthcare plan 
that nobody can afford, that should be 
our focus instead of focusing on mak-
ing 
other 
taxpayers 
pay 
for 
the 
unaffordable healthcare plan rates that 
we have. 
The Congressional Budget Office ex-
pects 2.3 million fewer people, by the 
way, to get their insurance on their job 
if the subsidies become permanent. 
Why should your employer pay for 
your insurance if the government will 
pay for it instead? Why would you pay 
some portion of the cost of your insur-
ance if the government will pay 100 
percent of the cost of your insurance? 
Another 200,000 people, because of this, 
would end up in Medicaid and the CHIP 
Program, or the Children’s Health In-
surance Program. 
This is a plan to get people com-
mitted to something that just simply 
doesn’t work. All it does is prove what 
President Reagan said, which he once 
said: 
Nothing lasts longer than a temporary 
government program. 
So we are going to be discussing, in 
the next few days, about how we want 
this 1-year program to become another 
2- or 3-year program, which clearly 
would become a permanent program. 
Temporary assistance in March of 
2021 and the other things in that bill 
that were spent immediately—that $1.9 
trillion bill—fed the fuel to the fire of 
inflation that we see right now. Com-
bine that with terrible energy policies, 
and American families feel it every sin-
gle day. 
We don’t need to do more of the 
same. We need to figure out what we 
did that created this problem and stop 
doing it. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER ELLA GRACE FRENCH TASK FORCE 
SUPPORT ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yes-
terday, during a hearing before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, I had a 
chance to share the story of this fallen 
hero from Chicago, IL. Her name is 
Ella French. 
Officer French joined the Chicago Po-
lice Department in 2018. A true public 
servant, she was always eager to help. 
She loved people, loved her family, and 
loved animals, particularly stray dogs. 
She would often pick them up in her 
squad car and ferry them to safety at 
the end of the day. 
Last year, tragically, Officer French 
was shot down during a traffic stop. 
She was 29 years old. Her partner, Car-
los Yanez, Jr., was seriously wounded. 
The gun that was used to shoot both of 
them had been straw-purchased in Indi-
ana, a State adjoining Illinois. A straw 
purchase takes place when someone 
without a criminal record, who can 
pass a background check, buys a gun 
for someone who cannot. In this case, 
the purchaser was turning the gun over 
to a convicted felon who used the gun 
to kill Ella and seriously wound her 
partner. 
During yesterday’s hearing, which fo-
cused on law enforcement officer safe-
ty, we were joined by Officer French’s 
mother, Elizabeth. She is a wonderful

person. I want to take this opportunity 
to thank Elizabeth French for her 
bravery and her commitment to hon-
oring her daughter’s legacy. 
I want to thank our witnesses, in-
cluding Chief Angel Novalez of the Chi-
cago Police Department, who himself 
was shot in the line of duty, for partici-
pating yesterday in the hearing. 
Every time law enforcement officers 
put on their uniforms and badges, they 
put their lives on the line, especially in 
a country that is now awash in guns, 
America, the country of 350 million 
people and 400 million firearms. In fact, 
guns are not only the No. 1 cause of 
death for America’s children, they are 
the leading cause of death for officers 
in the line of duty, second only to 
COVID. 
We have made some progress in re-
cent months in reducing the risk of 
gun violence for police officers and our 
families. The Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act included a provision I have 
long supported, cracking down on 
straw purchases, like the gun that was 
used 
to 
kill 
this 
amazing 
young 
woman. 
We still have a lot of work to do. Yes-
terday, I introduced legislation—and I 
have named it in Officer French’s 
honor—that would provide funding to 
multijurisdictional task forces to com-
bat straw purchasing: the Officer Ella 
Grace French Task Force Support Act. 
I am glad her mother was there to hear 
that. 
I hope every Senator who prides him-
self on supporting law enforcement will 
join me in this legislation. I can think 
of no better way to honor the service 
and sacrifice of our officers, to protect 
our families and our children, and to 
demonstrate to America that this Sen-
ate is serious about stemming the tide 
of gun violence in our country. 
RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTION ACT 
Madam President, in the United 
States of America, nearly all women— 
99 percent—use some form of contra-
ception in their lifetime to prevent un-
planned pregnancy. They use birth con-
trol pills, IUDs, condoms, and other de-
vices. Many women who are not sexu-
ally active still use birth control to 
manage medical conditions. 
Further, almost every woman who 
identifies as religious has used a con-
traceptive method in her lifetime—99 
percent of mainline Protestants, evan-
gelical Protestants, and Catholics—and 
96 percent of people with other reli-
gious affiliations. 
In short, women in all stages of life 
in America and of all religious back-
grounds rely on birth control. It is 
their constitutional right. It is their 
decision. But this right, this decision, 
is now under attack. 
Over a month ago, in Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health Organization, the 
U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. 
Wade, revoking for the first time ever 
an established constitutional right: the 
right to reproductive healthcare. And I 
fear that the Court’s assault on our 
fundamental freedoms is just begin-
ning. 
In his concurrence in the Dobbs opin-
ion, Justice Clarence Thomas urged the 
Supreme Court to ‘‘reconsider all of 
this Court’s substantive due process 
precedents, including Griswold, Law-
rence, and Obergefell.’’ He made ref-
erence in that statement to three Su-
preme Court decisions which have been 
on the books for over 50 years. That is 
an explicit threat by Justice Thomas 
against the very right to same-sex 
marriage, the right to consensual rela-
tionships between LGBTQ people, and 
the right to contraception, which has 
been protected by the Court’s decision 
in Griswold v. Connecticut for 55 years. 
In that case, Griswold, a super-
majority of seven Supreme Court Jus-
tices ruled that married couples have a 
right to access contraception. They 
based it on a word which you will not 
find in the Constitution: ‘‘privacy.’’ 
Now, more than half a century later, 
we are living in an America where 
women are no longer guaranteed this 
right to privacy, this right to reproduc-
tive healthcare, and where their very 
right to contraception is now in doubt 
and in jeopardy. 
This is not some alarmist rant. At 
this very moment, women in America 
are being denied their constitutional 
right to contraception. How could that 
possibly be in this country? Well, look 
no further than your local pharmacy. 
This past weekend, USA TODAY re-
ported on the story of Abigail Martin, 
a young woman who has been taking 
birth control pills for the past 6 years. 
She went to a Walgreens pharmacy to 
refill her birth control prescription, 
which had been prescribed by her doc-
tor. She was turned away by a phar-
macist at Walgreens. It took 4 days be-
fore she was finally able to access her 
medication by going to a different 
pharmacist. That is a dangerous delay 
in healthcare. Apparently, Walgreens 
allows its pharmacists to refuse to fill 
a prescription for which they have ‘‘a 
moral or religious conviction . . . [and] 
to refer the customer to another em-
ployee or manager on duty who will 
complete the transaction.’’ 
Since Abigail’s story went viral, 
other Walgreens customers have come 
forward to say that cashiers refused to 
ring up their condoms because they an-
nounced it violated their faith. 
A pharmacist should not be able to 
unilaterally decide that their personal 
moral or religious beliefs can delay or 
interfere with the medical needs of a 
patient standing at the cash register, 
buying a legal medication, which is 
why this week I sent a letter to the 
CEO of Walgreens, an Illinois corpora-
tion, for an explanation of their policy. 
If Walgreens is going to allow its in-
dividual employees to dictate what 
legal medical products customers can 
purchase, then the company should 
make this policy known to the public. 
They should be required to display 
signs at their cash registers alerting 
customers and the public that they 
may not be able to fill their prescrip-
tions or buy healthcare products in a 
timely manner. Given this informa-
tion, customers may decide to take 
their business elsewhere—to a phar-
macy that does not allow individual 
staff members to restrict or interfere 
with their customers’ legal purchasing 
decisions. 
A 
woman’s 
right 
to 
essential 
healthcare should not differ based on 
which pharmacy she chooses, who fills 
her prescription, or who rings it up. 
Her right to this personal decision in 
her life is fundamental—fundamental. 
That is why Congress must pass the 
Right to Contraception Act introduced 
by Senators MARKEY and MURRAY. This 
is a commonsense proposal, and I have 
cosponsored it. It would codify the 
right to contraception in America na-
tionwide—a right that has been undis-
puted for 55 years. 
We need this legislation because now 
women in America are living with the 
consequences of six unelected Justices 
erasing the constitutional right to re-
productive healthcare, and pharmacies, 
like Walgreens, are allowing their em-
ployees to dictate what healthcare 
products consumers are able to pur-
chase. Walgreens says they want to be 
respectful of the moral judgment of 
their employees and staff. Should they 
not also be respectful of their cus-
tomers? 
Politicians and pharmacists have no 
business standing between a woman 
and healthcare. If protecting this right 
sounds like common sense to you, then 
join us in supporting the Right to Con-
traception Act. 
If the Supreme Court will not respect 
this fundamental personal right, you 
have the right to demand that your 
Member of Congress will. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, across America, 
tens of thousands of cars are lined up 
bumper to bumper in a total standstill. 
This is not an ordinary traffic jam. 
You see, these cars are brand new. 
They were assembled by some of the 
finest names in American manufac-
turing. But they are missing some-
thing, a key, essential component: 
microchips. 
If you are in the market for a new 
car or even a fridge or a smartphone, 
there is a good chance you have felt 
the 
semiconductor 
shortage. 
These 
tiny pieces of silicon power nearly ev-
erything around us. But with the 
coronavirus epidemic, supply chains 
have been snarled and foreign factories 
have been shut down, which has led to 
a global shortage of microchips. 
This has had a devastating impact on 
American consumers, businesses, and 
workers. Over the past 2 years, the 
price of a new car has skyrocketed by 
20 percent—40 percent for used cars. We 
have seen the repercussions of this 
firsthand in my home State of Illinois, 
which is one of the leaders in the auto 
industry. Companies like Stellantis, 
which runs an assembly plant in 
Belvidere, have been forced to shut 
down production several times this 
year because of these shortages.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3721 
July 27, 2022 
Today, the Senate did something re-
markable: We passed a bill, a bipar-
tisan bill. How about that. And it is 
important. We came to the rescue of 
job creators like Stellantis and to the 
rescue of American consumers. We 
voted on this legislation to invest bil-
lions of dollars into making microchips 
right here in America. 
This bill is critical for the future of 
our economy. It is even critical for our 
national security. And we need it des-
perately for more scientific break-
throughs. But in the near term, the 
CHIPS Act is imperative for shoring up 
our 
Nation’s 
supply 
chain 
and 
strengthening 
our 
defense 
system. 
Why? Because microchips are essential 
not just for cars and refrigerators and 
smartphones but for guided missile sys-
tems and fighter jets. 
Right now, America has to rely on 
foreign suppliers like China to supply 
the chips that power the next genera-
tion of defense in America. That wasn’t 
always the case. In 1990, America pro-
duced almost 40 percent of the world’s 
supply of microchips. Today, make 
that 12 percent. Somewhere along the 
way, we settled for outsourcing semi-
conductor production to Asia. That is 
just 
unacceptable, 
and 
it 
is 
unsustainable. Imagine our turning to 
the Chinese Communist Party to deter-
mine whether or not we can buy the 
microchips that fuel our economy and 
protect our Nation. That is a dangerous 
scenario. 
I have heard a few colleagues voice 
concern about the subsidies in this bill, 
but—let’s be clear—this is no reckless 
corporate giveaway. The CHIPS Act 
will bring American factories back to 
life, creating good jobs in our country. 
The fact is, our competitors in Asia 
and even Europe are already investing 
billions of dollars in luring chipmakers 
away from America. We need to fight 
fire with fire. The CHIPS Act will. It 
will incentivize the biggest names in 
technology to manufacture right here 
in America, and if any company breaks 
their commitment to make it in Amer-
ica, we reclaim all of the funding that 
we give them under this bill. 
But beyond this economic and na-
tional security imperative, the CHIPS 
Act is important for another reason, 
one that really strikes at the heart of 
America: pioneering innovation. The 
CHIPS Act includes historic funding 
authorization for groundbreaking sci-
entific 
research 
at 
the 
National 
Science Foundation and the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Office of Science. 
This has been a particularly impor-
tant issue to me personally as a Mem-
ber of the Senate for many years. It 
was 7 or 8 years ago when I decided to 
try to push for increasing medical re-
search funds at the Federal level. I con-
centrated on the National Institutes of 
Health, with Senator ROY
BLUNT
of 
Missouri, who was just on the floor be-
fore me, joining me in a bipartisan ef-
fort with PATTY MURRAY in an effort to 
make this bipartisan and effective. It 
worked. We dramatically increased the 
investment in the NIH. But I knew that 
wasn’t enough. We needed the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Office of Science, as 
well as the National Science Founda-
tion, to have the same increase in fund-
ing. Today, with the passage of the 
CHIPS and Science bill, we are finally 
moving in that direction. 
We know how important scientific re-
search is. We have learned it over and 
over. For instance, finding that vaccine 
for COVID–19 in recordbreaking time 
was a result of investing in science and 
medical research years and years be-
fore. 
We also know that we have launched 
some things which are going to change 
the world. The James Webb Space Tele-
scope is one of those things. The deep-
est and sharpest photos of our universe 
are finally coming home to the United 
States and the rest of the world. 
What is NASA doing with this trove 
of data being collected by this tele-
scope now? Well, since NASA is funded 
by taxpayers, they are sharing it with 
researchers throughout the country. 
One professor at the University of Chi-
cago, Jacob Bean, says that he is plan-
ning on using this data to learn more 
about 
exoplanets 
orbiting 
faraway 
stars, whatever the possibilities may 
be that they can host a life. 
This one image of our universe has 
unleashed a flood of new ideas and just 
countless 
questions 
for 
researchers 
around the world. It shows how funding 
and 
scientific 
research 
can 
really 
change the place we live in. 
When we support scientists and re-
searchers, we are paving the way for 
new discoveries. NASA was critical for 
developing so many products. Imagine, 
if you will, that they had a lot to do 
with developing athletic shoes, CAT 
scans, and smartphone cameras. These 
staples of American life and more were 
unintended discoveries pioneered in 
NASA’s labs. 
With the CHIPS Act, we can kick- 
start a new generation of discovery. I 
am happy to say that, in Illinois, in the 
Chicagoland area, we have two of the 
best research operations in our coun-
try: the Argonne Lab and Fermilab. 
With this funding, these facilities 
will break new ground in researching 
emerging technology, like AI and quan-
tum computing. In fact, Argonne and 
Fermilab already partnered together 
with the University of Chicago to 
launch the most advanced quantum 
network in the world. They are plan-
ning to expand it to other parts of the 
country, bringing more research into 
this cutting-edge research technology. 
And much like space exploration 50 
years ago, quantum computing is the 
new frontier in science. We have only 
begun 
to 
explore 
techniques 
like 
teleporting qubits, which may sound 
like a line from Star Trek, but it has 
profound implications. 
Quantum computing could revolu-
tionize the way we design electric bat-
teries for cars, even solar technology, 
to maximize energy efficiency. These 
are the possibilities that lie before us. 
The passage of the CHIPS and Science 
Act today on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate is a vindication of our commitment 
to this Nation’s future and an invest-
ment that generations will thank us 
for. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, in a 
moment, I am going to propound a 
unanimous consent request. Before I 
do, I want to make some brief remarks. 
Right now, we have an administration 
that is killing oil pipelines, slow-walk-
ing natural gas licensing, illegally 
halting lease sales, and writing rules 
that Congress never gave the executive 
branch the authority to write. 
This is how President Biden regu-
lates our energy industry. In the morn-
ing, he complains that gas prices are 
too high, and he chastises oil and gas 
companies to produce more. Then he 
takes a nap, wakes up, and says the 
very existence of oil and gas companies 
offends him, and it is our duty to put 
them out of business. It is absurd. 
But today I want to focus on the 
Biden administration’s reckless release 
of our emergency crude oil stockpile, 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The 
President’s energy policy has been a 
failure so much so that today the 
United States produces 11⁄2
million 
fewer barrels a day of oil than it did in 
November 2019. 
That is why oil and gas prices are 
high. It is no mystery, and it is not 
principally because of the war in 
Ukraine, as much as Joe Biden and the 
Democrats want to blame it on that. 
At the same time that President 
Biden has tried to strangle U.S. energy 
production, 
he 
has 
simultaneously 
groveled to Saudi Arabia and to Ven-
ezuela, asking them to increase their 
production. And he has attacked small 
business gas stations around the coun-
try and told them: Just lower your 
prices. Then he has taken the unprece-
dented step of releasing an arbitrary 
amount of our emergency crude oil 
stockpile in order to try to lower gas 
prices before the midterm elections. 
The Biden administration has even 
sold at least 2 million barrels of oil to 
the Chinese Communist Party’s state- 
owned oil and gas company, Sinopec. 
One million barrels in April of this 
year, another million barrels in July 
sold to communist China. China, at 
this very moment, has created the 
world’s largest stockpile of crude oil, 
which according to Bloomberg totals 
926 million barrels. 
In comparison, under Joe Biden, our 
own reserves have fallen to 492 million

barrels of oil. That is the lowest level 
since December of 1985, according to 
the U.S. Department of Energy. 
Of course, no mention of China and 
the administration would be complete 
without noting that Hunter Biden’s 
private equity firm, BHR, has a major 
stake in Sinopec. 
But there is something we can do. I 
am calling on this body to pass the No 
Emergency Crude Oil For Foreign Ad-
versaries Act, which is cosponsored by 
11 of my colleagues. 
This bill takes the commonsense step 
of prohibiting the Secretary of Energy 
from selling our emergency crude oil 
stockpile—there to protect the na-
tional security of the United States— 
to communist China and also to other 
foreign adversaries, including Iran, 
North Korea, and Russia. 
It would also require a full account-
ing of where our crude oil has been sent 
for refining since the Biden adminis-
tration began releasing the oil in the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve last No-
vember. 
It is important to note we have no 
issue with exports in general. In fact, 
we want to continue to help our Euro-
pean allies remove themselves from 
their reliance on Russian oil. 
A recent study found that since 2015, 
U.S. oil exports increased oil and nat-
ural gas development in the United 
States, reduced global oil prices by 
$1.93 per barrel over a 6-year period, 
added $161 billion to our GDP, and 
added nearly 50,000 jobs here in Amer-
ica. 
But under no circumstances should 
we be giving our emergency stockpile 
to our enemies, particularly at a time 
when they are benefiting from stock-
piling cheap Russian oil and gas. This 
poses a direct threat to American na-
tional security, and the Biden adminis-
tration shows zero interest in stopping 
it. That is why Congress needs to act. 
This should be a simple and easy bi-
partisan measure to say we are not 
going to sell our Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve to communist China to use it 
against America. 
Therefore, Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 4515, and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The 
junior 
Senator 
from 
Con-
necticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
I appreciate the Senator’s interest in 
trying to make sure that American en-
ergy resources don’t go to benefit com-
munist China. And it is interesting be-
cause I don’t think a lot of Americans 
know that prior to 2015, the United 
States didn’t allow for the export of 
American oil. We saw it prior to 2015 as 
a strategic asset, all of the oil produced 
in the United States. 
Prior to 2015, we decided that the oil 
produced in the United States would 
stay in the United States; that it 
should benefit U.S. consumers. 
And I have heard my Republican col-
leagues come down to the floor over 
and over again calling the Biden ad-
ministration to do more drilling, to do 
more exploration, to authorize more 
permits under the belief that drilling 
in the United States will produce re-
sults for American consumers. 
But the reality is we have done more 
drilling in the United States, but much 
of that drilling and exploration has 
benefited—you guessed it—China. Prior 
to 2015, the United States didn’t export 
oil to China. In 2013, we exported .3 
million barrels, the next year .4 mil-
lion barrels, the next year 8 million 
barrels, the next year 80 million, then 
84 million, dipped down to 50, then 
back up to 176. In 2021, 91 million bar-
rels of oil shipped from the United 
States to China. 
And so if we are sincere about trying 
to make sure that American-produced 
oil benefits American consumers, rath-
er than the Chinese Communist Party, 
well, then let’s make that our policy. 
Let’s not limit the policy to the Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve; let’s just 
make the decision that American oil is 
going to benefit American consumers. 
Now, that change was made in 2013 as 
part of a compromise. Republicans 
wanted the ban on oil exports lifted. 
Democrats wanted the extension of 
some tax incentives for renewables. It 
was a bipartisan compromise. But now 
that we seem to have greater consensus 
around stopping American exports of 
fuel benefiting China, then let’s not 
just do this halfway; let’s make it a 
clear policy. 
And so I just learned of the Senator’s 
unanimous consent request this morn-
ing, and I will commit to him to learn 
more about the more targeted ap-
proach that he is making, but I am 
going to plan to object to it today un-
less we can modify it to make this pol-
icy universal. 
Senator MARKEY has a piece of legis-
lation that would reimpose that ban on 
the export of oil. It seems like a pretty 
important time to do that. If we have 
oil in the United States, why don’t we 
keep it here to benefit the people of the 
United States instead of shipping it to 
China? Senator MARKEY’s bill has lan-
guage in it that would allow for na-
tional interest exemptions so that if we 
needed to get oil to Ukraine, for in-
stance, we could still do that. But 91 
million barrels of oil, that is a lot of oil 
to be sending to China every year. 
And so I am going to ask that the 
Senator modify his request to pass 
Senator MARKEY’s legislation instead, 
which would, frankly, get at the con-
cern that Senator CRUZ is articulating 
but do it in a much more comprehen-
sive way. I expect he may object to 
that modification, and if he does, I will 
object to his original request but com-
mit to him to spend some time looking 
at his more targeted approach given a 
little bit more of a window. 
So I am going to make this request 
right now, which is that the Senator 
modify his request and instead that the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1415 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; further, that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. CRUZ. I do not. Reserving the 
right to object. 
Debates on the Senate floor some-
times can be clarifying. Over the 
course of the day, my office and I en-
gaged in good-faith negotiations with a 
number of Democratic Senators. We 
engaged in extensive negotiation with 
Senator MANCHIN, the chair of the rel-
evant committee. Senator MANCHIN 
proposed minor alterations to this bill 
and agreed to support it if we made 
those alterations. I agreed to accept 
Senator MANCHIN’s alterations, and we 
then had what was going to be a bipar-
tisan bill. 
Senator CANTWELL, likewise, we ne-
gotiated with her office today and had 
reached what we thought was an agree-
ment. 
And then at the last moment, the 
Senator from Connecticut raised this 
objection. And I think what he is ask-
ing this body to pass really clarifies 
where the extreme left wing of the 
Democratic Party is, which is the 
Green New Deal Democrats want to de-
stroy American energy jobs. They want 
to destroy the American oil and gas in-
dustry. They want to destroy our own 
production, and, bizarrely, they simul-
taneously want to benefit energy jobs 
of our enemies. 
There is some irony that the Senator 
from Connecticut is leading this objec-
tion because it was earlier this year 
when the Senator from Connecticut led 
the effort in this body to block sanc-
tions on Russia and Vladimir Putin on 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, sanctions 
that I had authored and passed into 
law, not once but twice; sanctions that 
had stopped that pipeline; sanctions 
that had prevented Putin from invad-
ing Ukraine; sanctions that hurt Rus-
sia and hurt Putin until Joe Biden be-
came President and decided to waive 
the sanctions on Russia and Putin to 
capitulate to Russia and Putin. 
When Biden did so, when Biden 
waived those sanctions, the Govern-
ment of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, 
said: If you waive these sanctions, Rus-
sia will invade Ukraine. The Govern-
ment of Poland said: If you waive these 
sanctions, Russia will invade Ukraine. 
And in January of this year, I forced 
a vote on imposing the sanctions. At 
the time, the Government of Ukraine 
begged us—there were tanks on the 
border of Ukraine, the invasion hadn’t

happened—and 
the 
government 
of 
Ukraine begged us: Please pass these 
sanctions. 
Now, every Democrat in this body 
had voted for my sanctions not once 
but twice. They had supported it when 
the President’s name was Donald J. 
Trump. 
But then they had a Democrat in the 
White House, and a Democrat, Joe 
Biden, who, on the day of the vote, 
came to Capitol Hill—it is the only 
time I know of that he has done this— 
to personally lobby Democrats to vote 
against sanctions on Russia, against 
sanctions on Putin, to vote to green- 
light a natural gas pipeline for Putin 
and Russia. 
And the Senator from Connecticut 
led the fight on the Senate floor, urg-
ing his Democratic colleagues: Flip 
your votes. Give an enormous present 
to Russia and Putin, and sacrifice 
Ukraine in the process. 
I stood on this floor and said: If you 
do this—the 44 Democrats who cast the 
vote—we will see Russian tanks in the 
streets of Kyiv. 
I wish that prediction had proven 
wrong, but it did not. 
What the Senator from Connecticut 
just came back with is: We should pro-
hibit all energy exports from America. 
And, in fact, I will read from the bill 
he called up. It is: 
The President . . . may restrict exports of 
. . . coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or 
petrochemical feedstocks. 
Shut down all exports. 
So I want you to understand the dif-
ference between my bill and the bill 
the Senator from Connecticut is asking 
us to pass. 
My bill says: Don’t sell our oil to our 
enemies. 
Communist 
China 
is 
our 
enemy. Russia is our enemy. Iran is 
our enemy. North Korea is our enemy. 
Let’s not sell our oil to our enemies. 
This is a reasonable, commonsense 
proposition. I am confident any one of 
us at home with our constituents, if 
you asked your constituents, ‘‘Should 
the President of the United States be 
selling oil that the American taxpayer 
has paid for, that is kept as a strategic 
reserve to keep America safe, should 
we be selling it to communist China,’’ 
the overwhelming majority of your 
constituents and mine, whether Demo-
crat or Republican, would say: Abso-
lutely not. That is idiotic. 
My bill says: Don’t sell our oil to our 
enemies. 
The Senator from Connecticut has 
responded with: Don’t sell our oil to 
anybody. Don’t sell our natural gas to 
anybody. Don’t sell it to our friends. 
Now, let’s be clear. There have been a 
lot of Democrats in this Chamber who, 
once the war in Ukraine started, stood 
up and said the key to defeating Putin 
is exporting our liquid natural gas to 
Europe so they can get off of depend-
ency on Russian oil and gas. 
I can’t count how many Democrat 
speeches I have heard saying what is 
absolutely true: We want our friends 
and allies purchasing energy produced 
here in America and not purchasing en-
ergy from our enemy. 
And what the Senator from Con-
necticut has just said is that we should 
abandon our friends in Europe. We 
should abandon our friends that want 
our energy. We should tell them: You 
know what. You are better off buying 
oil from Russia. You are better off buy-
ing oil from Iran. You are better off 
buying oil from Venezuela, which I 
guess makes sense because Joe Biden’s 
State Department was asking Ven-
ezuela, led by an illegitimate Nicolas 
Maduro, an enemy of America—the 
Biden administration is asking our en-
emies to produce more oil. 
So the effect of the Senator from 
Connecticut’s proposition would be to 
hurt jobs in America, hurt energy 
prices in America. By the way, it would 
drive up gasoline prices. If the ex-
tremes in the Democratic Party have 
their way, we won’t just see $5-, $6-, $7- 
a-gallon gasoline, we are going to see 
$10-a-gallon gasoline. That is where 
they want to go. 
And, by the way, the Transportation 
Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, said pub-
licly: This is the cost of transition. We 
have got to make gasoline expensive. 
In politics, that is called saying the 
quiet part out loud—that for too many 
of the extreme Democrats, they want 
working men and women to pay 100 
bucks, 150 bucks at the gas pump. Why? 
Because they don’t like that some 
moms choose to drive minivans. They 
don’t like that some Americans choose 
to drive a pickup truck or an SUV, and 
they want to force you to sell your 
Suburban and buy a Prius. And their 
strategy is: We are going to make it so 
expensive, so miserable that you can’t 
afford your bills until you comply with 
what they want. 
It is cynical, and it is misguided, but 
it does at least make transparent that 
the little stickers on the gas pump 
with Joe Biden pointing at the price 
saying ‘‘I did this’’—that is what they 
intend. 
We should not be selling oil to com-
munist China. Everyone in this body 
knows this. But that doesn’t mean it is 
a good idea to abandon our friends and 
send our friends and allies to become 
customers of Vladimir Putin. That is 
spectacularly ill conceived. 
And, therefore, I decline to accept 
the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The 
junior 
Senator 
from 
Con-
necticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, here is 
what the Senator from Texas is saying: 
It is fine to sell to China so long as you 
are a big American oil company and 
profiting off of it. 
That is the bottom line. 
The Senator had the chance to en-
dorse the policy that would have 
stopped all American exports to China. 
If the priority is to not enrich the Chi-
nese Government, then let’s enact that 
policy. 
What Senator CRUZ
is essentially 
saying is that if the end result is mas-
sive profits for the oil company, then 
we are just going to look the other 
way. Then we are just going to look 
the other way. 
The strategic petroleum reserve? No, 
we are going to keep that oil here. 
That can’t go to China. That would be 
an immoral abomination if the Chinese 
got their hands on that oil. 
But if the end result is that oil com-
panies get to pad their profits by sell-
ing oil to the Chinese, well, then that 
is fine. Well, then, that is fine. 
So let’s be 100 percent clear in what 
is happening here. If your priority is 
not selling oil to China, then let’s 
make that the policy. Let’s make that 
the policy. 
But that is not the priority. The pri-
ority is to make sure the oil companies 
can make as much money as possible. 
ExxonMobil expects to make $10 bil-
lion in profit—not revenue, in profit— 
in the second quarter of this year. So I 
don’t apologize for a second for making 
my priority the people of this country, 
not the profits of the oil companies. 
Yes, I want to keep American oil 
here because I want it to benefit Amer-
ican consumers, not the oil companies’ 
bottom line. 
And spare me the rewrite of history 
on Nord Stream 2. Those sanctions that 
we passed were ready to go for Donald 
Trump. What I objected to was the 
Senator being silent when Donald 
Trump sat on the sidelines and refused 
to implement those sanctions, and then 
taking a hard line when a Democrat 
was in the White House. 
Senator CRUZ held up every State De-
partment 
nominee 
that 
President 
Biden offered, as hostage in order to 
get a change on Nord Stream 2 policy. 
The Senator did not do that when Don-
ald Trump was in office, during a pe-
riod of time in which the pipeline was 
being built. 
By the time that Donald Trump left 
office, that pipeline was 95 percent 
built, and had Senator CRUZ taken the 
same policy during the Trump adminis-
tration, arguably, we could have been 
in a different place by the end of 2019. 
So I don’t apologize for saying: You 
know what. The oil companies are 
making too much money. Our prices, 
our constituents, our consumers should 
come first. And if we are serious about 
not exporting oil to China, then let’s be 
serious about it and make the policy 
universal. 
And so for that reason, I would ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The junior Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, you 
know, John Adams famously said: 
‘‘Facts are stubborn things.’’ So let’s 
clarify a couple of facts. 
No. 1, the bill that the Senator from 
Connecticut was pushing is a bill that 
is entitled the BAN Oil Exports Act. In

July 27, 2022 
his remarks a moment ago, he sug-
gested it was about China. This bill is 
not about China. This bill is about ban-
ning oil exports, natural gas exports, 
coal exports—energy exports across the 
board to anybody. 
By the way, the bill is authored by 
Senator MARKEY. It is cosponsored by 
Senators WYDEN, MERKLEY, SANDERS, 
and WARREN. The Senator from Con-
necticut is not a cosponsor of the bill. 
This is an extreme bill. 
As I pointed out in my remarks, what 
the Senator from Connecticut was ask-
ing is: Let’s refuse to sell oil or natural 
gas to our friends, and let’s make our 
friends buy them from Russia instead. 
In response to that, he said precisely 
nothing, nada. He said: ExxonMobil is 
bad. He said: Don’t sell to China. 
My bill says: Don’t sell to China. 
His bill says: Don’t sell to anybody. 
And as for his revisionist history on 
Nord Stream 2, he is right that the 
pipeline was over 90 percent completed 
by the time the Senate and the House 
took up my sanctions legislation, and 
the Russian disinformation that was 
put out was: It is over 90 percent com-
pleted; so there is no way to stop it. 
Putin stopped building Nord Stream 
2 the day that President Trump signed 
my sanctions legislation into law. Lit-
erally, that day they halted construc-
tion. A 90-percent complete pipeline is 
zero percent complete. It is a hunk of 
metal on the bottom of the ocean. The 
pipeline lay dormant—it was dead—for 
over a year. 
He complains that I didn’t hold Don-
ald Trump’s nominations? I didn’t need 
to. The sanctions worked. We had 
stopped the pipeline. 
Then Joe Biden became President. He 
immediately began signaling weakness 
to Russia. He began foreshadowing 
what he actually did in May, which is 
to waive the sanctions. 
Joe Biden was sworn into office on 
January 20, 2021. Putin recommenced 
building Nord Stream 2 on January 24, 
2021, 4 days after Joe Biden put his 
hands on the Bible. 
I find it very curious that Democrats, 
No. 1, ignored the pleas from our allies 
and stood with Russia and Putin to 
help Putin build a pipeline to generate 
billions for his war machine but at the 
same time are willing to stand up and 
say: We like Russian oil and gas jobs, 
but we don’t like American oil and gas 
jobs. 
We should not be selling oil or nat-
ural gas to our enemies. This is an ob-
vious proposition. It ought to be bipar-
tisan. It was bipartisan until this last- 
minute objection. 
But the fact that we shouldn’t sell to 
our enemies doesn’t mean we shouldn’t 
supply energy to our friends. Our 
friends are desperately asking for it, 
and sending them to buy from Russia is 
spectacularly foolish. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4612 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, a group of us will be speaking and 
then asking for unanimous consent on 
a measure called the Right to Contra-
ception Act. It is called the Right to 
Contraception Act because it guaran-
tees the right to contraception. 
If you had asked me a year ago, 6 
months ago, would we need a Right to 
Contraception 
Act, 
I 
would 
have 
thought not in my lifetime. But the 
fact is we live now in the post-Roe era. 
It is a unique moment in our Nation’s 
history, not just because the Supreme 
Court has overturned Roe v. Wade in 
the recent Dobbs decision but because, 
for the first time in our history, we are 
rolling back rights. 
The history of our great country, the 
greatest in the history of the world, is 
that we advance and expand rights. 
From the time of our founding, the 
ethos and tradition of America is that 
we increase rights and liberties that 
are protected from governmental inter-
ference. 
And now with Dobbs, one of the core 
freedoms—the right to decide when and 
whether to have children—has been 
stripped from women and given to gov-
ernment officials. But it isn’t only re-
productive rights under Roe, because 
the U.S. Supreme Court has very care-
fully, deliberately sent signals about 
where it is going in this rollback of 
rights and liberties. And it isn’t just 
Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion, 
which now has become infamous for its 
signals. It is the opinion of the Court 
itself that clearly shows that this 
Court threatens not only abortion 
rights, but also contraception rights. 
And in addition to mentioning Gris-
wold v. Connecticut, Clarence Thomas 
also—or I should say Justice Thomas, 
with all due respect—mentioned Lov-
ing, Lawrence, Obergefell—all of them 
on the chopping block, all those rights 
on this Supreme Court’s hit list. And 
perhaps the most deeply rooted of them 
all in Griswold v. Connecticut is the 
right to contraception. 
Now, let’s be clear. The right to con-
traception wasn’t stated in the Con-
stitution, but the right to privacy is at 
its core. ‘‘Don’t tread on me.’’ The 
right to be left alone—that is the rea-
son that we have the Bill of Rights. 
That is the reason why the Founders 
rebelled against England—undue, un-
justified interference in their personal 
lives. And so the right to privacy is re-
ferred to often as a conundrum; but, 
actually, it is at the core of the Con-
stitution. It is so fundamental to the 
mindset and the mantra of those con-
stitutional guarantees from the very 
founding of our Republic, and the re-
spect for the right of privacy should be 
bipartisan and, indeed, has been bipar-
tisan throughout our history. 
The simple fact is that the most im-
portant decision any of us make, at 
least in my view, is whether to become 
a parent. And it ought to be a deci-
sion—not something that just happens. 
It should be a decision that is made de-
liberately. 
Every 
American 
should 
have that right to decide when and 
whether to have children. And politi-
cians shouldn’t be the ones to make it. 
They shouldn’t be allowed to infringe 
or interfere on that decision. 
And women can’t be truly equal if 
they don’t control their lives, their re-
productive lives. If they don’t control 
their bodies, if they lose that right, 
they simply cannot be equal. So it is 
not just privacy; it is equality that is 
at stake here. 
My Republican colleagues are ada-
mant in dragging this country back to 
a time when women had little or no au-
tonomy over these choices. And I am 
shocked—and I think many of my col-
leagues are, the American people are as 
well—that American women today will 
have fewer rights than their mothers 
and even their grandmothers. We are 
living 
through 
a 
world 
where 
healthcare providers can’t do their jobs 
and save lives without risking criminal 
penalties, and much of our Nation will 
be at risk of losing these fundamental 
liberties. 
Let me be clear. This should not be 
controversial. This issue should not be 
one that provokes verbal jousts on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate. Griswold v. 
Connecticut—yes, it is Griswold v. Con-
necticut—has held for decades. It is en-
shrined in case law, reaffirmed by the 
Supreme Court that individuals have a 
right to use contraceptives. But we 
have seen after assurances by three of 
the members now sitting on the Su-
preme Court that respect for precedent 
really is no longer deeply felt—in fact, 
may not be felt at all. 
What 
one 
nominee, 
Justice 
Kavanaugh, referred to as ‘‘precedent 
on precedent’’ and, therefore, it is well- 
established law, that was Roe v. Wade. 
Now it is gone. It was, in Justice 
Alito’s words, ‘‘egregiously wrong.’’ 
But none of those three nominees ex-
pressed any feelings whatsoever that it 
might be wrong, let alone egregiously 
wrong. So to all my colleagues who say 
that the right to contraceptives is un-
necessary, I would simply say, Look at 
Dobbs. 
When I introduced, along with the 
Presiding Officer, the Women’s Health 
Protection Act in 2013, the idea that 
Roe might be overruled was unthink-
able. Our goal was to prevent the grow-
ing restrictions on that right that im-
posed excessive burdens. What was un-
thinkable then is reality now. The 
Court overruling Griswold might have 
been thought unthinkable, but that 
danger is our present reality in the 
post-Roe world. 
So I urge my colleagues to join in ap-
proving the Right to Contraception Act 
today to provide certainty and reassur-
ance to women across the United 
States that they will have those rights. 
They can be sure of them; they can 
rely on them; they will know that hav-
ing children will be a decision they 
make—not somebody else telling them 
when and whether to start a family. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Hawaii.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3725 
July 27, 2022 
afternoon, listen to some of the com-
ments made by my Republican male 
colleagues: 
They are not going to change the law on 
contraception. 
There is zero threat of contraception being 
taken away. 
Pure hysteria. 
I have no reason to believe these prece-
dents are going to fall. 
These are some of the statements 
made by my Republican colleagues—all 
of them male, by the way—have made 
regarding 
contraception. 
‘‘Pure 
hysteria,’’ they say. This is not pure 
hysteria to the millions of women 
across the country who woke up one 
morning in June and no longer had a 
constitutional right. 
When it comes to this far-right, agen-
da-driven Supreme Court, nothing is 
off the table and nothing is ‘‘pure 
hysteria.’’ 
Last month, the far-right majority of 
the Supreme Court overturned nearly 
50 years of precedent and took away 
the constitutional right to get an abor-
tion. This decision was the result of a 
decades-long effort by far-right Repub-
licans and rightwing groups to pack 
the courts with politicians in Roe. 
And they are just getting started. 
For this MAGA majority, controlling 
women’s bodies doesn’t stop at forcing 
women to give birth. They actually 
want to ban contraception. We know 
this because, in this concurring opinion 
to overturn Roe, Justice Thomas wrote 
that the Supreme Court should recon-
sider—reconsider—the rulings that pro-
tect same-sex relationships, marriage 
equality, and, yes, contraception. 
This kind of signaling by a Justice of 
a Supreme Court should be taken seri-
ously. 
So my Republican colleagues saying 
they have no reason to believe prece-
dent will be overturned is resorting to 
magical thinking that no one should 
believe. After all, the Supreme Court 
just overturned a nearly 50-year prece-
dent that women in this country relied 
on for nearly half a century—half a 
century. That is two generations. In 
fact, radical MAGA Republicans in 
State legislatures across the country 
are gearing up in Ohio. 
House Republicans introduced a bill 
that would effectively ban all abortions 
from the moment of conception and, 
potentially, other forms of birth con-
trol, like IUDs. 
Other Republicans have refused to 
rule out banning certain forms of con-
traception. We are living in a post-Roe 
world where our rights are on the chop-
ping block. So, no, this is not ‘‘pure 
hysteria.’’ The American public knows 
this. Democrats know this. 
So I say to my Republican col-
leagues, if any of you object to this 
bill, come down to the Senate floor and 
tell the American people the truth. 
Just be honest that you do not support 
guaranteeing the right to contracep-
tion because, in this post-Roe world, 
any suggestion that this Court won’t 
overturn precedent is no longer some-
thing to hide behind. But if my Repub-
lican colleagues do support the right to 
contraception, then they should have 
no problem with supporting our bill, 
which would create a statutory right 
for individuals to access contraception, 
protect the right to healthcare pro-
viders to provide contraception to their 
patients, and empower individuals by 
extending a private right of action 
against any State or government offi-
cial that hinders these rights. 
Today, my Republican colleagues 
have a choice. Do they support the 
right to contraception and an individ-
ual’s right to make decisions about our 
bodies and our healthcare? Or will they 
allow the government to tell millions 
and millions of women what to do? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, an 
illegitimate, stolen, and radicalized 
U.S. Supreme Court is putting the fun-
damental rights of Americans in jeop-
ardy. Last month, the extremist Court 
took away the right to abortion, a 
right on which millions of Americans 
have relied for almost 50 years, under-
mining their health, their safety, their 
freedom. 
The rightwing majority that over-
turned Roe v. Wade owns its control of 
the High Court to then-Leader MCCON-
NELL’s and Donald Trump’s and Senate 
Republicans’ theft of two seats on the 
Supreme Court. The Justices used their 
ill-gotten power to cast aside decades 
of precedent—precedent, which during 
their confirmation hearings they prom-
ised to honor, respect, and follow. 
If anyone thinks this newly empow-
ered Court’s decision to strip Ameri-
cans of a longstanding constitutional 
right won’t be shamelessly repeated, 
they are wrong. What the Supreme 
Court just did with Roe is a preview of 
coming atrocities from this Supreme 
Court. 
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a 
concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization, the de-
cision overturning Roe v. Wade. And 
that concurrence is like a movie trailer 
for an upcoming horror film that 
Americans are forced to watch written, 
produced, and directed by a captured il-
legitimate Supreme Court. In his opin-
ion, Justice Thomas made clear that he 
believes Americans have too many pri-
vacy rights under the U.S. Constitu-
tion, that the Supreme Court had erred 
in recognizing those rights, and that 
the Court should take them away as 
well—just as it did with the right to 
abortion. 
This bears repeating. 
A sitting Justice on the Supreme 
Court of the United States is arguing 
that Americans have too many rights. 
What mistakes was Justice Thomas 
talking about? 
Well, 
Justice 
Thomas 
urged 
the 
Court to correct the error the Court 
committed when it recognized this 
right to same-sex marriage in its 2015 
decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. 
He told the Court to fix the mistake 
it made when it recognized the right of 
Americans to engage in private, con-
sensual sexual activity in its 2003 deci-
sion in Lawrence v. Texas. 
Then he said the Court got it wrong 
when it recognized the right of Ameri-
cans to use contraception in its 1965 de-
cision in Griswold v. Connecticut. 
But it is Justice Thomas who is in 
error, who is wrong, who has made a 
mistake. These are all fundamental, 
privacy-based rights which the Su-
preme 
Court 
correctly 
recognized. 
They should all remain the law of the 
land. 
Today, I want to talk about the right 
to contraception that this extremist 
and out-of-touch Supreme Court and 
legislators in red States are taking aim 
at. 
The Supreme Court has recognized 
the constitutional right to contracep-
tion for more than half a century, since 
its decision in the Griswold case in 
1965. Over time, the Court has affirmed 
and expanded that right: in its 1972 de-
cision, 
a 
Massachusetts 
case, 
Eisenstadt v. Baird, recognizing the 
right of all people to access contracep-
tives regardless of marital status; and 
in its 1977 decision in Carey v. Popu-
lation Services International, which 
held that a State could not constitu-
tionally prohibit the distribution of 
contraceptives to minors. 
The right to contraception is there-
fore a fundamental right that the 
Court has repeatedly recognized and re-
affirmed. It is a right that is central to 
a person’s health, to their well-being, 
to their life, liberty, equality, and eco-
nomic and social freedom in our coun-
try. It is a right grounded in the need 
and ability to make decisions about 
one’s own body, one’s own family, and 
one’s own future. It is a right that is 
woven into the fabric of a free, plural-
istic, and modern society. And it is a 
right that we must codify and make 
part of our law so that far-right, ex-
tremist judges and elected officials 
cannot take it away in order to ad-
vance their own blatantly political 
agendas. 
That is why I have proudly intro-
duced the Right to Contraception Act 
with my colleagues Senators MAZIE 
HIRONO and TAMMY DUCKWORTH, with 
Senator BLUMENTHAL and Chair PATTY 
MURRAY of the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions, and 
have been joined by more than half of 
the Democratic Senate caucus. 
The Right to Contraception Act 
would codify the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Griswold, recognizing the right 
to obtain and use contraception. The 
Right to Contraception Act would en-
shrine that right in Federal law, and it 
would guarantee a healthcare pro-
vider’s right to prescribe contraceptive 
products and services and information 
related to them. 
The bill would also protect a range of 
contraceptives that are legally mar-
keted under the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act. The Right to Con-
traception Act would authorize the

July 27, 2022 
U.S. Attorney General, as well as indi-
viduals 
and 
healthcare 
providers 
harmed by unlawful restrictions, to go 
to court to enforce the rights the bill 
establishes. 
In short, the Right to Contraception 
Act would safeguard the rights estab-
lished by more than 50 years of Su-
preme Court precedent and would pro-
tect access to contraception even if 
Griswold were overturned. 
The concerns that have led to the in-
troduction of this bill are not merely 
hypothetical. Justice Thomas’s concur-
ring opinion was a call to action that 
some Republicans and red States are 
eagerly heeding by continuing to at-
tack and restrict the right to contra-
ception. 
Several States have already gone 
after access to contraception by cut-
ting off the public funding for it, by 
seeking to define abortion broadly 
enough to include contraception, and 
by allowing healthcare providers to 
refuse to provide services related to 
contraception based on their own per-
sonal beliefs. 
And the harms that would flow from 
abolishing the right to contraception 
aren’t merely theoretical. Attacks on 
healthcare, 
especially 
reproductive 
healthcare, fall hardest on historically 
marginalized communities, including 
Black, indigenous, and other people of 
color, LGBTQ people, people with dis-
abilities, people with low incomes, 
those living in rural and underserved 
areas, and immigrants. 
Last week, we all on our side proudly 
watched the House pass its version of 
the Right to Contraception Act by a 
vote of 220 to 195, though it is dis-
maying that only 8 House Repub-
licans—only 8—voted to codify that 
right. 
With the right to abortion stolen, the 
right to contraception threatened, and 
the need to protect and expand access 
to contraceptive methods and informa-
tion on contraception, it makes it 
more imperative than ever that we 
pass this legislation. We can’t wait for 
the next hammer to drop. We have an 
urgent obligation to take the first exit 
off this slippery slope that leads to the 
loss of our most personal freedoms— 
chief amongst them: the right of all 
Americans to make their own decisions 
about their bodies, their families, and 
their own futures. 
We can’t sit idly by and watch as dec-
ades of precedent, privacy rights, and 
progress are violated. We can’t wait for 
the worst to come—because it is al-
ready at our doorstep. 
To my anti-choice Republican col-
leagues, if you would deprive Ameri-
cans of the choice to end a pregnancy, 
how can you also deprive them of the 
ability to prevent a pregnancy in the 
first place? 
Unless your ultimate aim is, really, 
to exert control over the bodies of oth-
ers, especially the bodies of women, 
then I expect to hear no objection to 
the unanimous consent request to pass 
the Right to Contraception Act. Other-
wise, the Republican position will be 
clear to everyone: no abortion but no 
birth control to prevent the need for 
one. 
That is where the Republican Party 
is today. I urge my Republican col-
leagues not to object to our unanimous 
consent request. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on the Ju-
diciary be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 4612 and that the Sen-
ate proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, here we are 
again—another day, another sympa-
thetically titled bill offered by my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
wherein 
the 
talking points don’t really give you the 
full story—case in point, the Right to 
Contraception Act. 
The so-called Right to Contraception 
Act purposefully goes far beyond the 
scope of contraception. It includes pro-
visions that could guarantee the fund-
ing of abortion providers and that de-
fines ‘‘contraceptive’’ in such a broad 
way that it could include drugs to in-
duce an abortion weeks or months into 
a pregnancy. This definition also could 
include non-FDA-approved drugs that 
would actually put a woman’s health 
at risk. 
The bill also flies in the face of dec-
ades of work in providing for con-
science protections. It would require 
organizations to administer contracep-
tives despite their moral or religious 
beliefs. 
There is something insidious with 
this bill, but don’t take it from me. 
Look to the bill’s text itself. The ‘‘find-
ings’’ section of this bill notes the 
work of an organization that many of 
my colleagues will recognize: The 
United Nations Population Fund. This 
is the same organization that contrib-
uted over $10 million to a mass steri-
lization campaign in Peru in the nine-
ties. 
That campaign was rife with coercive 
practices: Quotas were set; cash bo-
nuses were paid to health workers for 
each client sterilized; and poor women 
were bribed with nutritional supple-
ments and clothes for their children. 
Then let’s not forget the former Pop-
ulation Fund executive director’s high 
praise of China’s one-child policy. 
But let’s be clear here. Routine-use 
contraceptives should be more easily 
available, and the fact that they aren’t 
has the biggest impact on women in 
rural areas, where a doctor could be 
dozens of miles away. A woman in a 
rural area doesn’t need a platitude- 
filled messaging bill like the one we 
have here. She needs over-the-counter 
access to routine-use birth control. 
Luckily, Republicans have a solution. 
My bill, the Allowing Greater Access 
to Safe and Effective Contraception 
Act, incentivizes manufacturers of con-
traceptives to file an application for 
over-the-counter access. It also allows 
priority review for these applications 
and waives the FDA filing fee. That 
means cheaper, quicker, and more 
available access for women across this 
Nation. 
With my bill, women 18 and over can 
walk 
into 
their 
local 
pharmacies, 
whether they be in Sidney, IA, or in 
the deepest parts of Manhattan, and 
get the routine-use birth control they 
need. 
When your doctor is 30 miles away 
and gas is $6 a gallon, you don’t need a 
messaging bill; you need access. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4638 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 4638, which is at the desk; 
further, that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Massachu-
setts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I thank the 
Senator from Iowa, but her bill would 
not ensure access to birth control, and 
it fails to codify the constitutional 
right to birth control across the United 
States. 
In fact, her bill would actually re-
strict access to birth control for indi-
viduals under the age of 18—requiring a 
prescription even if the Food and Drug 
Administration has approved an over- 
the-counter option. And we cannot lose 
sight of the fact that this bill does 
nothing to address the reality that, for 
many women, true access means being 
able to afford birth control as well. 
Last month, I cosponsored a bill that 
would guarantee that insurers fully 
cover over-the-counter birth control 
without any out-of-pocket costs. No 
one should have to jump through ridic-
ulous hoops or pay extra just to get the 
birth control they need, not to mention 
that this bill would do nothing to pre-
vent States from restricting or even 
banning access to birth control. 
The reality that Republicans refuse 
to acknowledge is that an over-the- 
counter option doesn’t help patients if 
their States are chipping away at their 
right to birth control. 
So, with the Senator from Iowa’s ob-
jection to my unanimous consent re-
quest and with her counter unanimous 
consent request, the Republicans have 
made their position crystal clear: no 
abortion but no birth control to pre-
vent the need for one. 
Republicans have just shown the 
American people where they stand on 
their right to contraception. While Re-
publicans won’t protect our funda-
mental rights as the Supreme Court 
and rightwing State legislatures take

them away, my Democratic colleagues 
and I will continue our efforts to keep 
in place the fundamental, privacy- 
based rights that Americans have had 
for decades and codify into Federal law 
the right to contraception. 
As a result and for those reasons, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it 
has been nearly 60 years since the Su-
preme Court decided Griswold v. Con-
necticut and affirmed Americans’ right 
to privacy and, with it, their right to 
contraception. So you would think this 
would be a settled issue, and for the 
vast majority of Americans, it is. The 
right to birth control is overwhelm-
ingly popular. It turns out that people 
want to be able to control their own 
bodies and make their own decisions 
about starting a family. 
Yet, as we just saw, somehow, in the 
year 2022, this is not a settled issue for 
Republican politicians. We have seen 
some of my Republican colleagues not 
only block this but try to deny reality, 
try to say this isn’t an issue or claim 
that Democrats are somehow wasting 
time. 
Well, that is pretty rich because I 
can’t help but remember how we all 
heard some Republicans saying the Su-
preme Court would not overturn Roe as 
well, how they tried to claim Demo-
crats were ‘‘overreacting’’ even as they 
stacked our courts with anti-abortion 
judges and worked for decades to chip 
away at abortion rights. 
Now we are seeing the nightmare we 
warned about become reality: women 
unable to control their own bodies and 
get the abortion care they need—a 
nightmare Republicans tried to deny 
and are still trying to deny even as it 
happens, even as 10-year-olds are hav-
ing to travel across State lines for an 
abortion after being raped, even as 
women are now being left bleeding for 
days, waiting for treatment for their 
miscarriage. 
So when Republicans say they sup-
port the right to birth control, my 
issue isn’t simply that I am skeptical; 
it is that I know better. Let’s be clear. 
When I say that I know better, I don’t 
just mean in my gut; I mean I have 
heard Republicans’ own words. I am 
watching their own actions. 
Justice Thomas said explicitly in his 
concurring opinion in Dobbs that he 
wants the Court to reconsider Gris-
wold, which affirmed the right to con-
traception. The senior Senator from 
Tennessee said the Griswold decision 
was unsound. That alone would be 
scary enough, but Republicans aren’t 
just talking about undermining access 
to birth control, they are already tak-
ing action. Read the legislation from 
Republicans in Idaho, Missouri, Lou-
isiana, Arkansas, and Michigan, which 
would, in fact, outlaw Plan B and IUDs. 
Talk to women who have already gone 
to the pharmacy, only to be denied 
their birth control or Plan B. Yes, this 
is already happening to people. Just 
last week, 195 House Republicans voted 
against the Right to Contraception 
Act, and now today, they have blocked 
it in the Senate as well. 
The evidence of where Republicans 
actually stand on birth control is over-
whelming. They aren’t standing for 
women. They aren’t standing for fami-
lies. They aren’t standing for a right 
nearly all Americans support. They are 
simply standing in the way. 
I want to thank the junior Senator 
from Massachusetts, the junior Sen-
ator from Illinois, and the junior Sen-
ator from Hawaii for their work with 
me on the Right to Contraception Act 
that Republicans just blocked. I know 
we are going to all keep working on 
this. 
I do want to set the record straight 
because so many of the arguments we 
have seen from Republicans don’t add 
up. They are trying to distract from 
their extreme position. We won’t let 
them. 
This 
bill 
is 
incredibly 
straight-
forward, so you simply cannot say you 
support the right to birth control and 
then block this bill. I hope everyone 
will listen closely because here is what 
this bill actually does. It simply codi-
fies Americans’ right to birth control 
into law. That is it. You don’t have to 
take my word for it; read it yourself— 
it is all of 15 pages. It protects a right 
people depend on and makes sure no 
one can take that away. We are talking 
about a really basic and really funda-
mental right here. 
Since that right was affirmed half a 
century ago, generations of Americans 
have used contraception to control 
their own future, to manage and treat 
their healthcare needs, and start a 
family when they are ready to. For 
them, it is not political, and it 
shouldn’t be political here in Congress 
either, especially when protecting this 
right is supported by a majority of 
Democrats, a majority of Independents, 
and, yes, even a clear majority of Re-
publicans. 
The American people are watching 
closely. They were watching previously 
when Senate Republicans blocked us 
from protecting the right to travel 
across States to get abortion care. 
They were watching last week when 
Senate Republicans blocked expanding 
support for our Nation’s longstanding 
Family Planning Program. They were 
watching when the vast majority of 
Republicans in the House voted against 
the right to birth control. And they are 
watching right now as Republicans 
block a bill that preserves the right to 
use condoms, take the pill, get IUDs, 
and buy Plan B, as Republicans refuse 
to let us protect that right and pass 
this bill and continue denying the 
threats that are already undermining 
that right. This is a basic, fundamental 
right. 
Mark my words, the American people 
will not forget Republicans blocking us 
from getting this done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Madam Presi-
dent, in 1963, Americans could be ar-
rested in some States simply for buy-
ing birth control pills. Sixty years 
later, if many States have their way, 
Americans may face that reality once 
again. 
The Supreme Court’s overturning of 
Roe v. Wade is so sweeping, so unprece-
dented that it now threatens the right 
to 
contraception. 
IUDs, 
emergency 
contraceptives, and other birth control 
could well all be banned, which seems 
hard to imagine. We are going back-
ward in time to when women did not 
have control of their own bodies, nor 
the freedom to decide how and when 
they wanted to begin their families. 
Who really believes that a woman 
shouldn’t be able to use birth control; 
that a woman shouldn’t be able to de-
cide whether or not she wants to get 
pregnant; that a couple can’t decide 
they aren’t ready for a family? How 
many children should each woman 
have? Should it be as many as possible? 
Are they allowed to stop reproducing 
or is it a lifelong duty? Politicians 
should not be making these decisions. 
This is a bill that guarantees a wom-
an’s right to access legal contracep-
tion. That is it. There is no trick, no 
sleight of hand. We can pass it into law 
today. The House has passed it already. 
Starting a family is among the most 
private and personal decisions a person 
can make. It changes your life in ways 
that most of us can’t even imagine. Yet 
there are people who want to force this 
restriction on women. 
For women everywhere but especially 
in rural and low-income areas, birth 
control is essential healthcare. If you 
want 
to 
prevent 
unintended 
preg-
nancies, well, that is where you start. 
When I was Governor, Colorado made 
long-acting, reversible contraception, 
like IUDs, available at little or no cost. 
That reduced unintended pregnancies 
by 54 percent—54 percent. Yet, now in 
Colorado, some Republicans are cam-
paigning to put an initiative on the 
ballot this November that could make 
contraceptives 
illegal. 
Many 
other 
States are considering similar moves 
with bills or amendments waiting in 
the wings. 
I think this is far, far beyond the 
mainstream of what most Americans 
believe. In fact, 92 percent of Ameri-
cans, in a recent Gallup poll, said that 
contraception is morally acceptable. 
My mother was born in 1921, a child 
of the Great Depression. She scrimped 
and saved every penny, but she always, 
always made it a point to make some 
donation to Planned Parenthood. Some 
years, it might only be $10. But she be-
lieved there were few burdens harder 
for a woman to bear than being com-
pelled to start a family before she was 
ready. As a mother of four, she knew 
how important it was for women to be 
able to make that decision for them-
selves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3728 
July 27, 2022 
Who are we, as politicians, to tell 
American women who has children, 
how many, and when? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise in support of the Right to Con-
traception Act. 
Thirty-three days ago, the Supreme 
Court issued a rule shredding nearly 
five decades of precedent protecting a 
woman’s 
right 
to 
make 
her 
own 
healthcare decisions. Now women, as 
we have seen over the last weeks, are 
at the mercy—are at the mercy—of a 
patchwork of State laws governing 
their ability to access reproductive 
care, leaving them with fewer rights 
than their moms and their grandmas. 
So now a woman in Minnesota has dif-
ferent rights when it comes to her re-
productive care than a woman in Mis-
souri, and a woman in North Dakota 
has different rights than a woman in 
Indiana. That is what we are dealing 
with right now. 
Two weeks ago, I joined several of 
my Democratic colleagues on the floor 
to push for legislation to preserve a 
woman’s right to travel to other States 
to access reproductive care, led by Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO. Unfortunately, Re-
publicans on the other side of the aisle 
blocked us from that vote. 
So we came back last week to push 
for legislation, led by my colleague 
Senator TINA SMITH, to protect and ex-
pand funding for a program created 
under a Republican administration, a 
Republican 
Presidential 
administra-
tion, to fund clinics that support ma-
ternal care, conduct cancer screenings, 
and provide contraception, but, again, 
that vote failed because we were not al-
lowed to move forward with it. 
So we came back to the floor today 
because if the Supreme Court won’t 
protect people’s fundamental rights— 
that is why we have three branches of 
government. That was the concept of 
our Founding Fathers. So if the Su-
preme Court isn’t going to protect peo-
ple’s fundamental rights, then every-
one in this Chamber has to decide 
whether or not they are going to do it, 
and that includes making sure every-
one can access contraception. 
I am concerned that the worse is yet 
to come. Right now, State and local 
legislators are literally racing, along 
with Governors, to be the first to say: 
Which State can limit rights the most 
first? Which rights can we take away? 
Sadly, it is not too hard to guess. 
In his concurring opinion in Dobbs, 
Justice Thomas actually laid out a 
roadmap with clear directions for how 
the Court could overturn the right to 
contraception. He said that the Su-
preme 
Court 
‘‘should 
reconsider’’— 
‘‘should reconsider,’’ those two words— 
whether the Constitution protects the 
right to access contraception, as well 
as the right to marry whomever you 
love. Why? Because he talked about 
looking at other cases with regard to 
the right to privacy. 
The Supreme Court has recognized 
the right to access contraception for 
more than 57 years, but the conserv-
ative Justices on the Supreme Court 
have shown they won’t hesitate to 
overturn decades-old precedent no mat-
ter what they say at their Supreme 
Court hearings. 
This threat is not hypothetical. Last 
year, the Missouri State Legislature 
tried to cut off public funding for wide-
ly used contraceptives, like IUDs and 
Plan B. Mississippi’s Governor has re-
fused to rule out banning contracep-
tion. A bill was introduced in Lou-
isiana this spring that could be used to 
make IUDs illegal. 
These radical proposals don’t just 
hurt those in the States that imple-
ment the bans. Since the Dobbs deci-
sion, we have now seen how State bans 
create an uncertain legal environment 
for doctors and strain resources at clin-
ics in States like Minnesota because 
the North Dakota clinic had to lit-
erally start a GoFundMe page to be 
able to get the costs paid for—the 
costs, of course, of moving the clinic 
from Fargo, ND, to Moorehead. That is 
what is happening right now in my 
State. 
We cannot settle for a situation, as I 
noted, where people in my State have 
different rights than women in Mis-
sissippi or Missouri. And with so many 
extreme politicians out there racing to 
State capitals to be the first to take 
people’s rights away, we need to explic-
itly protect the right to access contra-
ception and information about contra-
ception. 
I will note that more than 80 percent 
of Americans support access to contra-
ception. That is why I joined with Sen-
ators MARKEY, HIRONO, MURRAY, and 
DUCKWORTH in cosponsoring this bill to 
protect the right to access contracep-
tion and information about contracep-
tives. This bill safeguards a patient’s 
ability to seek contraceptives and a 
healthcare provider’s ability to provide 
those critical services. 
The right to contraception can’t just 
be an empty promise. That is why the 
bill gives the Department of Justice, as 
well as patients and doctors, the power 
to make sure that we don’t infringe on 
the right to contraception. 
I am proud to join my colleagues, and 
for the last 33 days I have been think-
ing about all the women in this coun-
try facing an unacceptably uncertain 
future. Today, each and every one of 
my colleagues had the opportunity to 
make clear where they stand, but, 
when given the opportunity, some 
seized the opportunity to protect the 
right to contraception, some did not. 
I hope that some of our colleagues 
will change their minds and we can 
move forward with this and put in 
place these laws protecting the right to 
travel; protecting the right to contra-
ception; and, of course, in the end, pro-
tecting a woman’s fundamental right 
to make her own reproductive deci-
sions about abortion. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
Senators be permitted to speak prior to 
the scheduled rollcall vote: myself for 
up to 15 minutes, Senator BLACKBURN 
for up to 10 minutes, and Senator 
TESTER for up to 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, coming 
to the floor and listening to some of 
my colleagues talk about their concern 
for lack of access to contraception— 
and some have said we need to pass a 
bill codifying same-sex marriage when 
that is currently the law of the land by 
virtue of a Supreme Court decision, the 
Obergefell case—reminds me of the old 
story about the little boy who cried 
wolf. He cried wolf when there wasn’t 
any danger; and then, once there was 
danger, people didn’t come to his aid 
because they thought it was another 
phony crying wolf. 
I can understand our colleagues— 
given inflation, given crime, given the 
broken borders—wanting to change the 
subject to something else, but that is 
all this is. This is mere posturing pre- 
November, pre-midterm elections. This 
isn’t about changing the law because 
the law already permits ready access to 
contraceptives. The law already per-
mits same-sex marriage. 
So this idea that we ought to spend 
scarce time here in the Congress, which 
we have in limited supply, reaffirming 
rights that already exist, is a clear po-
litical narrative designed to divert the 
American 
people’s 
attention 
from 
things that really are at risk—that is, 
the paychecks of every American fam-
ily because of inflation, because of 
failed energy policies. 
We know that the price of gasoline 
and diesel and fuel to fill up your car 
so you can go to work or take your 
child to school or summer camp has in-
creased. We know that our cities are on 
fire due to spiking crime waves con-
nected to drugs that are coming across 
the southern border. And, of course, we 
know that the southern border is com-
pletely open with a big red carpet and 
a welcome mat out for anybody who 
wants to come to the United States il-
legally. 
And the cartels that are rich and get-
ting richer because of the flow of their 
human traffic are also getting rich be-
cause of the flow of illegal drugs that 
took the lives of 108,000 Americans last 
year alone. 
We know where those drugs are com-
ing from and that the Biden adminis-
tration is doing absolutely nothing to 
stop them. I would want to change the 
topic too. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. President, on a more positive 
note, the Senate approved funding ear-
lier this morning to bolster domestic 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
by 
a 
vote of 64 to 33. This funding will help 
kick-start the development of these

microprocessors, these chips that go 
into everything from your cell phone 
to the F–35, to Javelin and Stinger mis-
siles that we send to Ukraine to defend 
their country from Russian aggression. 
This funding will help kick-start a do-
mestic production of these semiconduc-
tors in a way that will prevent a vul-
nerability of our supply chain, since 90 
percent of those advanced semiconduc-
tors currently come from Asia, with 60 
percent coming from Taiwan alone. 
One other benefit to this bill is that 
this bill could create roughly 185,000 
jobs every year as these new facilities 
are constructed. Long term, it could 
bring another 280,000 jobs online. And 
once these foundries are operational, 
they will supply ‘‘Made in America’’ 
semiconductors that can be used on ev-
erything from smartphones to cars, to 
airplanes, to missile defense systems. 
Semiconductors are the cornerstone 
of this legislation, but the bill also 
takes a range of other steps to help 
propel innovation in the competition 
we are currently in with the People’s 
Republic of China. This bill authorizes 
investments in research that will sup-
port everything from robotics to next- 
generation wireless technology. 
It also authorizes NASA programs 
that will keep America at the forefront 
of space exploration. It extends the au-
thorization for the International Space 
Station to 2030. This is very important, 
especially now that Russia has said it 
will end its commitment to the Inter-
national Space Station after 2024. 
This bill also lays the groundwork 
for America’s continued presence in 
space after 2030, including language I 
championed requiring NASA to develop 
a strategy to retire the International 
Space Station and transition to a suc-
cessor platform. It also enhances exist-
ing programs that support future ex-
ploration missions. This includes the 
Moon to Mars Program, which is lead-
ing efforts to get an American astro-
naut on the surface of Mars. 
Texas is the proud home to the John-
son Space Center, the home of human 
space flight, but also a range of other 
universities and companies leading the 
way in human space exploration. Ena-
bling these partnerships saves money, 
drives innovation, and gives us a com-
petitive edge over countries like Rus-
sia and China. 
The broader bill included in the 
CHIPS Act will support both our eco-
nomic and our national security and 
strengthen our efforts to lead the world 
in scientific innovation. The way we 
are going to compete with China and to 
beat them is to out-innovate them be-
cause no country in the world has bet-
ter human capital, better brains, and a 
better system to encourage innovation, 
which will keep us ahead of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China. 
They don’t play by the rules. They 
certainly don’t observe the rule of law. 
They steal all the technology they can 
get. But it is important for the United 
States to be in the game and not be left 
behind. 
I want to thank Mr. WARNER, the sen-
ior Senator from Virginia, for launch-
ing this effort with me 2 years ago. We 
introduced the CHIPS for America Act 
in June of 2020, which demonstrates 
how long it takes to get important leg-
islation passed here in the U.S. Con-
gress. Since the time we introduced it, 
I have worked with our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to secure the 
necessary funding so we could deliver 
the benefits for our country. 
Countless colleagues have been part 
of the process over these last few 
weeks, particularly Senator YOUNG, 
Senator PORTMAN, Senator WICKER, 
Senator SINEMA, and countless others; 
and Senator CANTWELL and certainly 
Senator SCHUMER as well and numerous 
others have led the charge on this leg-
islation. Their hard work and their 
willingness to work cooperatively to-
gether and to find common ground is 
the reason for our success. 
This has been a long, winding road 
with a lot of twists and turns along the 
way, but the end is finally in sight. 
Speaker PELOSI has promised to bring 
this legislation up for a vote in the 
House, and I hope our colleagues across 
the Capitol do not dally and get this 
bill voted out of the House and to the 
President’s desk. 
Chip manufacturers are watching 
Congress and waiting to see if this bill 
passes before they decide where to 
build new fab manufacturing facilities. 
And we have been told that, unless this 
bill passes, these hoped-for manufac-
turing jobs and these semiconductor 
manufacturing fabs will not be built 
here in America but will be built in Eu-
rope and other places around the world. 
Secretary Raimondo, the Secretary 
of Commerce, has assured our col-
leagues that the United States will 
miss out on big benefits in terms of 
jobs, national security, and our econ-
omy if Congress doesn’t pass this bill 
by the start of the August recess. 
Once 
this 
bipartisan 
legislation 
passes the Senate, our Democratic col-
leagues are reportedly planning a dra-
matic pivot from bipartisanship to an 
ultrapartisan 
reconciliation 
process. 
Apparently, they are willing to work 
together when it is convenient, but 
they are also willing to abandon the 
notion of working together and are pre-
paring to go on another reckless, par-
tisan spending spree. 
This isn’t the first time. At the start 
of last year, Democrats spent nearly $2 
trillion in unnecessary spending on a 
party-line basis. People wonder why we 
have 9 percent inflation. Part of it is 
our Democratic colleagues are willing 
to shovel money out the door and chase 
limited goods with supply chain prob-
lems, which means that prices get driv-
en higher and higher—as well as, as I 
mentioned, flawed energy policies that 
look for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
to increase production rather than to 
produce more American oil and gas 
here at home. 
Well, our Democratic colleagues suc-
ceeded in that $2 trillion bill, and they 
tried to pass another partisan bill at 
the end of the year which would have 
cost the American people nearly $5 tril-
lion. But, thankfully, that entire effort 
failed. 
Now, some of our colleagues are com-
mitted—this is their last chance before 
the August recess—to take advantage 
of the rules of the Senate and to go on 
a partisan spending bonanza, and cer-
tainly they don’t want to miss this op-
portunity. 
We are hearing that our colleagues 
are frantically piecing together a bill 
that has not yet even been written and 
completed and passed the so-called 
Byrd bath test with the Senate Parlia-
mentarian. So we are waiting to see 
whether they can meet the time dead-
line of the end of next week or not. 
As I said, the bill is still reportedly 
being written, so we don’t even have a 
good picture of everything that is in it. 
But we do have an understanding of the 
general framework, and it is not look-
ing good for the American people. For 
example, our colleagues have said their 
proposal will implement government 
price controls on lifesaving drugs, a 
move that will stifle innovation and 
end up with scarcity. That is what 
price controls always do. 
Then we have heard that they plan to 
expand and extend the ObamaCare tax 
subsidies. This all started with a par-
tisan spending bill that became law 
last year. It expanded the amount of 
taxpayer 
assistance 
people 
receive, 
which, in short, gave more money to 
more people, including lifting the cap 
on individuals who could receive those 
subsidies above $400,000. 
Of course, at the time, the camel’s 
nose under the tent was that it was de-
signed as a temporary provision. But 
here we are a year and a half later, and 
they are already trying to extend it, 
indicating that there was nothing tem-
porary intended by it. 
They claim it is not a permanent ex-
tension and that it will only last 2 or 3 
years, but I have no reason to believe 
that Democrats will give up on extend-
ing those provisions when they expire. 
In the words of Ronald Reagan, the 
closest thing to eternal life on Earth is 
a government program. Once created, 
they will not die, even if they are no 
longer necessary. And of course, a per-
manent extension will cost the Amer-
ican people a lot of money. 
Last week, the Congressional Budget 
Office and the Joint Committee on 
Taxation released a report of the true 
cost of a permanent expansion, and it 
is pretty shocking for a number of rea-
sons. First is the financial cost. By ex-
panding the ObamaCare premium tax 
credits and making them permanent, 
Democrats will add $248 billion to the 
Federal deficit over the next decade. 
Mr. President, my age and your age— 
we are not going to be the ones who 
have to pay that money back. But 
these young people sitting down here 
are going to have to pay the price for 
the profligate spending today, and all 
Americans will pay the price by adding 
fuel to the fire of inflation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3730 
July 27, 2022 
For whatever reason—reasons I real-
ly can’t fathom—the Federal debt and 
the national debt are of no concern to 
our Democratic colleagues. They sim-
ply don’t seem to care. They act as 
though we are playing with Monopoly 
money, that we can print and borrow 
like there is no tomorrow because none 
of this really matters. But we know 
that is not true. Every dollar we spend 
is paid for by taxpayers, and every 
ounce of debt we accrue will be carried 
and repaid by our children and our 
grandchildren. But none of this seems 
to matter to our friends across the 
aisle. They are still plowing ahead with 
this legislation. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
irresponsible 
spending isn’t even the worst part. Our 
colleagues claim this extension will 
allow 
more 
Americans 
to 
afford 
healthcare, 
but 
the 
Congressional 
Budget Office and the Joint Committee 
on Taxation told us that under this 
plan, some 2.3 million Americans will 
lose their current coverage provided by 
their employer. Some 2.3 million Amer-
icans will lose their coverage provided 
currently by their employer. Hard- 
working Americans whose health in-
surance is currently covered by their 
employers would be told: You are on 
your own now. And no matter what you 
negotiated when you negotiated your 
salary with your employer, presumably 
if you are a union member and subject 
to a collective bargaining agreement 
where your union negotiated a gen-
erous healthcare plan, all of that will 
be in jeopardy by this reckless expan-
sion of the ObamaCare subsidies. 
Our Democrat friends want to con-
tinue subsidizing healthcare for six-fig-
ure earners. People earning 750 percent 
of the Federal poverty level would be 
eligible for taxpayer-funded subsidies— 
750 percent of the poverty level, you 
would get cash from Uncle Sam. Our 
country would be essentially paying 
wealthy people to lose their current 
employer-provided healthcare so they 
can end up on the government subsidy. 
This is simply crazy policy: driving 
up the deficit, kicking people off of 
their employer-provided health plans, 
and forcing taxpayers to subsidize 
health insurance for the rich. This isn’t 
about helping the uninsured; it is a 
backdoor way to implement Medicare 
for All. Yes, Joe Biden may be Presi-
dent, but it is the BERNIE SANDERS 
agenda at work here. 
Of course, Democrats couldn’t get 
enough support for this radical plan, so 
they are trying to jam it through on 
party-line votes. Instead of attempting 
to pass a massive, unpopular bill all at 
once, they are trying to serve it to the 
American people in spoonfuls. Bit by 
bit, they are trying to push America 
closer to a single-payer health system. 
American people do not want Medi-
care for All. People who have their em-
ployer-provided coverage want to keep 
it. And the American people don’t want 
the Federal Government subsidizing 
wealthy people who can afford to pay 
for their own healthcare. 
This is a bad idea whose time I hope 
has not come, and I hope our friends on 
the other side of the aisle will simply 
give up on this massive, partisan tax- 
and-spending spree bill that will do no 
good and will do a lot of harm. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
my colleague from Texas was just talk-
ing about how taxes go up and spending 
seems to increase. This week, we have 
had before us a bill that was going to 
be about 30 billion and then 52 billion 
and then 72 billion. Now it comes out, 
and it is almost $300 billion. 
This is a piece of legislation that has 
had a variety of different names, and I 
have found it so interesting that it has 
had so many different names. Let’s see. 
It has been called CHIPS, CHIPS+, 
CHIPS and Science, USICA, Endless 
Frontier, and ‘‘China COMPETES.’’ 
You know, it seems as if there was a 
name that was given whenever there 
was an occasion that you thought you 
could rename something and make it 
fit, and I know DC is just famous for 
having these bills with the acronyms 
and the fancy-sounding names. But 
when I talk to Tennesseans, it is so ap-
parent they are tired of that. What 
they want are the facts. They want 
someone who is going to tell them the 
truth. What they know is that China is 
an adversary; they are not a compet-
itor. They know that we have to work 
diligently to stay competitive with 
China and not let them get the upper 
hand. But when we talk about these 
issues, sometimes we lose sight of that 
big picture. I do feel that as we talked 
about the CHIPS bill and semicon-
ductor supply chains, this is something 
we lost sight of. 
You know, there are some of us who 
have worked on the issues of dealing 
with China going back into the early 
years of this century, looking at IP 
theft, looking at reverse engineering, 
looking at the way the Chinese Com-
munist Party would dip in and grab up 
great ideas from American innovators 
and then off to the races they would 
go. We have a lot of companies that 
learned a lot of tough lessons trying to 
manufacture in China. And then we 
come up near the pandemic. 
When I was over in the House and be-
fore that period of time, we had an 
issue and realized that our active phar-
maceutical manufacturing was where? 
In China. We couldn’t get penicillin. 
Why was that? It was because there 
was one factory in China that made 
that, and the factory had an explosion. 
So we had a shortage on that. Then we 
had an issue with Heparin, and we had 
some deaths that were caused by a 
tainted product that was coming out of 
a factory there. 
So Senator MENENDEZ and I had a 
piece of legislation that would have 
incentivized returning active pharma-
ceutical ingredient manufacturing to 
the United States. Then we got into 
the issues of the pandemic, and then 
everyone was saying: Critical supply 
chains—we need to bring them back. 
Indeed, that is something that is im-
portant to do. Chips are an important 
part of that. Our laptops, our elec-
tronics, our automobiles all need chips, 
and there was a shortage. People began 
to realize that our military aircraft, 
our radar systems, our major defense 
systems all needed the chips. But, like-
wise, we needed active pharmaceutical 
ingredients. 
We 
needed 
our 
tele-
communications 
supply 
chains. 
We 
needed 
polysilicon. 
We 
needed 
ag 
chemicals. All of these are critical sup-
ply chains. 
Personally, I was optimistic about 
the possibility that we were finally 
going to begin to unravel this relation-
ship we have had with the Chinese 
Communist Party. I see it as a dan-
gerous relationship. But, like many 
pieces of well-intentioned legislation, 
it became a victim of some of the same 
compulsion to squeeze money from the 
American taxpayer and put it into a 
very narrow silo. 
So after more than 2 years of work-
ing on these issues and multiple failed 
iterations, what we have is a bill that 
spends about $300 billion and is a gate-
way to industrial planning. I know that 
many of my colleagues have read some 
of the postmortems on this, and people 
realize this wasn’t about chips. It 
wasn’t 72 billion. There was authoriza-
tion language in there that was going 
to balloon this. 
There was beefing up of the National 
Science Foundation, and we have Na-
tional Labs that do a lot of that work. 
There were protections for U.S. manu-
facturing, some anti-China provisions, 
security provisions, that, guess what, 
poof in the night, a line drawn through 
them. They are out. 
Wasn’t that to be the purpose of this 
legislation? Of course it was. Let’s 
bring the manufacturing back to the 
United States. And that is what we 
should have done. We should have 
looked at ways that we could bring 
manufacturing back across the range 
of critical supply chains. 
We all know that China’s control 
over our active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients and other pharmaceutical prod-
ucts—that is a problem. Control over 
our telecom equipment—yes, that is a 
problem. Huawei equipment that we 
are having to rip out and replace in 
this country; telecom equipment that 
is part of our critical supply chain; 
control over our supplies of minerals 
and chemicals—for the Chinese Com-
munist Party to control that, that is a 
problem. 
So many who worked on this have 
spent 2 years looking at and working 
on supply chains and competition, and 
now what they have is legislation that 
invests billions of dollars in one indus-
try, one industrial sector, and promises 
hundreds of billions of dollars more to 
the NSF that will duplicate many of 
those 
efforts 
that 
are 
already 
in 
progress at our National Labs and 
other DOE facilities. 
So we are 2 years and $280 billion into 
this, and about $80 billion of that goes

into one industry. Honestly, it does not 
add up. We could have spent that time 
and a lot less money so much more 
wisely. We could have used tax credits 
to incentivize multiple industries to 
come home, to set up shop in business- 
friendly States like Tennessee and cre-
ate thousands of jobs for American 
workers. 
This is what you call a missed oppor-
tunity. And, unfortunately, the new 
axis of evil—they are watching, and I 
think they like what they see. I think 
they like it. I think they like it when 
we don’t appear to be focused, when we 
don’t appear to take the steps to chal-
lenge them across the board. We are 
running out of time to truly unravel 
ourselves from the influence of the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, it seems 
a bit like deja vu all over again. We 
have been here before. We were here be-
fore the Fourth of July talking about 
the PACT Act, the toxic exposure bill, 
the bill that has been in the works for 
15 years and that the ranking member 
and I have worked on very hard over 
the last 18 months, year and a half. 
We are going to vote on it again here 
in a moment. This is a bill that has 
been talked about a lot on this floor, 
and just about everything has been 
said about this bill. It is a bill that al-
lows us, the American people, to live 
up to the promises we make our Ac-
tive-Duty military when they come 
home with an injury—in this case, 
toxic exposure. 
We have had toxic exposures—well, in 
World War I, it was mustard gas; radi-
ation in World War II; and, of course, 
Agent Orange in the Vietnam war. We 
have had toxic exposures over and over 
and over again. In the Middle East, it 
is burn pits. 
Over the last year and a half, we have 
had many hearings on this bill. In fact, 
we had a gentleman testify that he had 
a lung disorder. He was in tough shape. 
And, in fact, he passed away a few 
months ago. 
The truth is, this is a bill that we 
need to pass. And we passed it already 
with 84 votes, and I think we had a cou-
ple of Senators gone or we would have 
had 86. It is a bill that is bipartisan in 
nature, and it is a bill that I think 
every Senator who votes for this bill 
can be proud that we are supporting 
the men and women who have felt the 
wounds of battle and are now trying to 
get their life back to normal. 
But it is more than just the folks 
who served in our military; it is also 
their families. I would encourage all 
the Members of the body to support 
this bill. 
It costs $27 billion a year, but it is a 
cost of war. If we are not willing to 
take care of our men and women when 
they come back from battles that we 
send them off to, then maybe we ought 
to rethink whether we are going to 
send them in the first place. This bill is 
a bill that was pushed by every vet-
erans service organization out there. It 
was their No. 1 priority. We listened to 
the veterans, and we ended up with a 
piece of legislation that is very, very 
good. 
If we are able to pass this out of the 
Senate again, this time it won’t be 
going to the House. It will be going 
right to the President’s desk, and we 
will have done right by our veterans in 
this country; we will have done right 
by the next generation of fighting men 
and women who will become veterans; 
and we will have had our veterans’ 
backs along the way. 
I yield the floor.

MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I

Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss three civilian nominees: Mr. 
Robert Storch, Ms. Tia Johnson, and 
Mr. Russell Rumbaugh, who are each 
nominated to hold critical positions 
within the Department of Defense. 
They have been on the Executive Cal-
endar for months. Yet I am unaware of 
any objections to these nominees re-
lated to their qualifications for the po-
sitions for which they have been nomi-
nated. 
I need not remind my colleagues, 
with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and 
the increasingly aggressive actions of 
China, how critically important it is to 
ensure the Defense Department has the 
people power it needs to do its job well. 
I would also like to note that in the 
past, my colleagues have been very 
cognizant of this need for the smooth 
workings of the Defense Department, 
and nominees for the Department— 
both civilian and military—have been 
voted out of committee and off the 
floor quickly, typically by unanimous 
consent. I find it ironic now, at a time 
when we see unparalleled threats to 
our national security, that nominees 
for the Department of Defense would be 
held for months on end, with no objec-
tions on qualifications, without any 
path to confirmation other than a clo-
ture vote. 
There are presently eight Defense De-
partment nominees waiting on the Ex-
ecutive Calendar. At the end of next 
week, it will be 12. Today, I would like 
to discuss these three individuals. 
Mr. Robert Storch is nominated to be 
the Department of Defense inspector

general and was favorably reported out 
of the Armed Services Committee on 
March 8, 2022. 
The Defense Department has not had 
a Senate-confirmed inspector general 
since January 8, 2016. I will repeat that. 
The Defense Department has not had a 
Senate-confirmed 
inspector 
general 
since January 2016. The last nominee, 
put forward by then-President Obama, 
was withdrawn by President Trump on 
February 28, 2017. 
Mr. Trump designated the Honorable 
Sean O’Donnell as the acting DOD IG 
on April 6, 2020, but the GAO recently 
issued a decision that Mr. O’Donnell’s 
continuing service as the acting inspec-
tor general is in violation of the Va-
cancies Act. As such, there is really no 
effective inspector general in the De-
partment of Defense—the largest Agen-
cy in the Federal Government. 
For these reasons, in addition to the 
fundamental importance of the IG’s 
work, the Senate needs to confirm Mr. 
Storch as soon as possible. The Depart-
ment has been without a Senate-con-
firmed IG for more than 6 years, and 
we cannot wait any longer. 
Ms. Tia Johnson was reported out of 
the committee on April 5, 2022, and 
would become one of five judges on the 
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, 
often referred to as the ‘‘Supreme 
Court of military law.’’ The court’s 
next hearing is scheduled for October 
12, 2022, where it will consider impor-
tant 
jurisdictional 
and 
substantive 
issues in military criminal law. 
Importantly, the FY22 NDAA imple-
mented extensive changes to the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice, includ-
ing a statute that would criminalize 
sexual harassment under some cir-
cumstances. Ms. Johnson will play a 
critical role on the Court of Appeals in 
reviewing challenges and issues with 
the recent sexual assault and sexual 
harassment statutes, including defend-
ants’ rights under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice. 
Without Miss Johnson, the court 
risks deadlock, which will further ham-
per the military’s ability to provide 
good order and discipline, which is fun-
damental to any military force. 
Mr. Russell Rumbaugh was nomi-
nated on March 21, 2022, to serve as the 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Fi-
nancial Management and Comptroller. 
This nomination was privileged, so it 
did not require a hearing and was in-
tended to move expeditiously. The 
committee sent policy questions to Mr. 
Rumbaugh and received his answers on 
April 25, 2022. The committee reported 
out his nomination on May 12, and pur-
suant to S. Res. 116, his nomination 
was moved 10 days later to the appro-
priate section of the Executive Cal-
endar and was ready for confirmation 
by the full Senate. So his confirmation 
has been waiting for 2 months. 
The Navy has not had a confirmed 
Assistant Secretary for Financial Man-
agement and Comptroller since July 
2020. This role is critical to managing 
the budget and financial readiness of 
the Navy and the Marine Corps, to in-
clude the Department’s audit. Many 
will point out and criticize, with some 
reasonableness, the fact that the De-
partment of Defense has not yet passed 
an audit. Well, it is very difficult to 
pass an audit if you have critical indi-
viduals who are not in place to help 
you prepare for and pass such an audit. 
That is another reason I think we 
need—the Navy needs a comptroller. 
Each of these positions are critically 
important to the Department of De-
fense. The sooner they assume their of-
fices, the better for the Department’s 
ability to tackle these challenges on 
behalf of servicemembers and their 
families and the Nation. And, indeed, 
the sooner they are there, the more we 
will be able to support the men and 
women in uniform in the United States 
who are deployed across the globe. 
They need that kind of support here in 
Washington. 
With that, Mr. President, I would ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nominations en 
bloc: No. 843, No. 861, and No. 972; that 
the nominations be agreed to without 
intervening action or debate; the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table; that any state-
ments related to the nominations be 
printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from Missouri has objected, and I 
believe he is the only individual Mem-
ber of the Senate who objects. In that 
case, I think I would be prepared to 
offer another unanimous consent that 
would allow debate upon these mem-
bers. That, I think, should be satisfac-
tory to the Senator, because it will 
give him an opportunity to express his 
objections to these individuals and why 
they are not qualified to be in office. 
With that, I renew my above request, 
except that I ask unanimous consent 
that at a time to be determined by the 
majority leader, in consultation with 
the Republican leader, the Senate pro-
ceed to executive session; that there be 
1 hour for debate, equally divided in 
the usual form on the nominations en 
bloc; that upon the use or yielding 
back of time, the Senate vote on the 
nominations in the order listed; and 
that following disposition of the nomi-
nations, the Senate resume legislative 
session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island has the floor. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe I 
retain the time, but if the Senator 
would like me to make a short state-
ment and then object— 
Mr. HAWLEY. Sure. 
Mr. REED. I think the easy thing to 
do is let me yield such time as the Sen-
ator requires. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I thank the chairman. 
It is always a privilege to be on the 
floor with the Senator from Rhode Is-
land and to serve him on the com-
mittee, so thank you for that. 
I would just say this: It has been 
nearly a year now since the events, the 
catastrophe, in Kabul that claimed the 
lives of 13 servicemembers, including 
from my home State of Missouri. 
This was a catastrophe of this admin-
istration’s making, and it has been now 
nearly 2 weeks, maybe 3, since I began 
to enter into the RECORD, page by 
painstaking page, this report under-
taken by U.S. Central Command about 
that disaster at Abbey Gate in Kabul, 
about those deaths, not to mention the 
hundreds of American civilians who 
were left behind. 
I am entering this report into the 
RECORD so the American people can see 
it because I cannot convince my friend 
from Rhode Island to hold a public 
hearing on this report, and I cannot 
convince the White House to stop their 
coverup of the events at Abbey Gate 
and the role they played in it. 
This is not for lack of trying. For 
months on end, I have come to this 
floor and asked for a public hearing on 
this report. I have asked my col-
leagues. I have written to the chair-
man. I have spoken to members of the 
committee, who, by the way, say they 
have no objection. 
And just last week, the White House 
reached out to me and said: What is it 
that you want? 
I said, I want accountability for what 
happened in Afghanistan and Abbey 
Gate, and, specifically, I want a public 
hearing on this report, to which the 
White House said it is up to the chair-
man. 
So I hope that we can make some 
progress on actually getting account-
ability for what happened, for the serv-
icemembers whose lives were lost, and 
we 
can 
end 
this 
continual 
Vietnamesque, yearlong effort to push 
this crisis out into the shadows, to ig-
nore it as if it never happened, and to 
deny the American people the account-
ability that servicemembers deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I reclaim 
my time. 
I respectfully disagree with the Sen-
ator from Missouri on this matter. The 
Senate 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
conducts and has conducted extensive 
oversight on Afghanistan. Committee 
actions include seven public and closed 
hearings regarding the War in Afghani-
stan, lessons learned, and ongoing re-
gional counterterrorism requirements

July 27, 2022 
since the withdrawal last August. And 
Senator HAWLEY has participated in all 
of these. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022 contained a 
provision, section 1092, that mandated 
the Department of Defense deliver 
quarterly briefings, in both unclassi-
fied and classified form, on the secu-
rity situation in Afghanistan and ongo-
ing counterterrorism efforts. 
The classified briefings have taken 
place on January 20, April 14, and July 
21. The unclassified briefings have 
taken place on February 14 and April 
25. An additional unclassified briefing 
will be held tomorrow, coincidentally, 
and Senator HAWLEY has full access to 
all of these briefings. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022 also contains a 
provision, section 1069, which requires 
a yearly assessment of our over-the-ho-
rizon counterterrorism capabilities in 
Afghanistan. While the first install-
ment has not yet been delivered to the 
committee, Senator HAWLEY will have 
access to those assessments, as well as 
will all of my colleagues. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022 further man-
dated the establishment of the Afghan-
istan War Commission, which will 
spend 3 years examining all aspects of 
the 20-year war in-depth. All the Com-
missioners have been appointed, and we 
expect the Commission to commence 
work in the near term. And Senator 
HAWLEY will have the same access to 
the Commission’s findings as everyone 
else. 
What I think the Senator does not 
understand is that the events that took 
place at Abbey Gate were not unique to 
that moment in time. They were the 
culmination of 20 years of actions by 
Presidents from both sides, by com-
manders on both sides. And in order to 
understand what truly happened at 
Abbey Gate, we have to look at all of 
those periods. 
What 
was 
the 
effect 
of 
Donald 
Trump’s agreement with the Taliban, 
excluding the legal government of Af-
ghanistan, to essentially leave? And 
what other events created the situa-
tion that led directly to the situation 
at Abbey Gate? Without that context, 
this will simply be a way to vilify the 
administration, a way to point out 
shortcomings, and it won’t get to what 
we really should be focused on: What 
profound lessons can we learn from 20 
years in Afghanistan that will assist us 
in the future, that will protect our men 
and women in uniform? 
Again, if the focus is on political re-
taliation and retribution, that is part 
of this organization. But if we want to 
focus on protecting today the lives of 
men and women who serve and their 
families who will grieve if they are 
lost, then we have to take a broader 
view, which we are doing in the Com-
mission, which we are doing when we 
bring our experts in on a frequent basis 
to talk about Afghanistan—and which 
we must do by filling these positions in 
the Department of Defense. 
Without the support of a functioning 
Department of Defense, we will be in a 
situation where we are putting at risk 
the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, 
and guardians who protect this Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
PACT ACT 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want 
to make just a brief comment about 
the cloture vote that just occurred 
shortly before the Senator from Rhode 
Island sought the unanimous consent 
agreement. 
And, as you know, cloture was denied 
on that bill, and, as you also know very 
well, that doesn’t mean the bill is de-
feated. It simply means that the oppor-
tunity to amend it isn’t eliminated. 
There haven’t been any amendments. 
That is unfortunate. 
But I want to just stress that my 
concern about this bill has nothing to 
do with the purpose of the bill. It is not 
about the approximately $280 billion of 
new spending that is meant to be re-
quired under this bill for the VA to 
cover Medicare and other—healthcare, 
I should say, and other benefits for vet-
erans who are exposed to toxic burn 
pits. What I want to change has abso-
lutely nothing to do with any of that. 
I see the chairman of the committee 
of jurisdiction. I think he understands 
that I have no interest in modifying 
the purpose of this bill, all the work 
that he and many others have done. 
And, by the way, I suspect there are 85 
votes for this bill, for the underlying 
bill, if we fix this problem. 
And here is the problem. Completely 
unrelated to the $280 billion of new 
spending, there is a mechanism created 
in this bill—it is a budgetary gim-
mick—that has the intent of making it 
possible to have a huge explosion in un-
related spending: $400 billion. This 
budgetary gimmick is so unrelated to 
the actual veterans’ issue that has to 
do with burn pits that it is not even in 
the House version of this bill. 
So, the fact is, we can fix this to-
night. This is a relatively easy fix. 
There might be a few technical things 
we would iron out, and we could get 
this done tonight. And I know the 
chairman of the committee very much 
wants to get this bill done. This is the 
path to do it. And if we fix this—which, 
as I say, I would recommend we fix it 
tonight—we could do that by a unani-
mous consent request. We could do it 
any number of ways. 
But once that is done, this bill sails 
through this Chamber and goes to the 
President and gets signed into law. So 
I just want to urge my Democratic col-
leagues to join me in working this out. 
This is not what this bill was about. 
We can fix it. We can do it imme-
diately. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the good 
Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. I 
want to see this bill passed. I want to 
see this bill passed for all the reasons I 
have talked about many times in com-
mittee and on this floor. 
This is about living up to the prom-
ises for our veterans. This is about 
making sure that when the veterans 
come back from exposures to burn pits 
or oil well fires or Agent Orange, that 
they don’t have to go to the VA and 
fight for their healthcare and their 
benefits. 
It impacts 31⁄2 million veterans in 
this country. By the way, there will be 
a few more who die before we get this 
bill passed. 
And I would also say that, as the 
Senator from Pennsylvania says, I am 
all for the $278.4 billion over 10 years 
on this bill; I have got no problem with 
that—well, the fact is, he does have a 
problem with that. The fact is, by 
doing what happened today on this 
floor, the real issue here—and make no 
mistake about it—is the money that is 
being spent to take care of our vet-
erans. 
And I have said it before, and I will 
say it again. If you have the guts to 
send somebody to war, then you better 
have the guts to take care of them 
when they get back home—or don’t 
send them in the first place. 
Now, let’s talk about the $400 billion, 
OK, because, quite frankly, what this is 
about—this is about not even trusting 
the people in this body. We have an Ap-
propriations Committee, and we vote 
on appropriations bills, and we set the 
levels in the accounts based off of ap-
propriations. Let the process work. 
Let’s not tie the hands of appropri-
ators. Let’s make sure we let the proc-
ess work. That is what we have always 
done. 
But the good Senator from Penn-
sylvania’s amendment ties the hands of 
the appropriators. Make no mistake 
about this, the American people are 
sick and tired of the games that go on 
in this body. They are sick and tired of 
us working for Democrats or working 
for Republicans and not working for 
the American people. But this is bigger 
than that. 
We have an All-Volunteer military in 
this country. If you don’t think young 
people are watching what we are doing 
today who are thinking about signing 
up for the military, you are sadly mis-
taken. And when we don’t take care of 
our veterans when they come home, 
they are going to say: Why should I 
ever sign on the dotted line because, of 
the promises that I made and the 
promises the country made, only half 
that deal is being respected—my half. 
This is a sad day in the U.S. Senate. 
This is the biggest issue facing our vet-
erans today. Make no mistake about it, 
if it wasn’t, every veterans service or-
ganization wouldn’t be out there talk-
ing to us and have been talking to me 
for the last 15 years. 
So we can make up all sorts of ex-
cuses about how this is going to move 
money around, but—let me tell you 
something—we are the ones who decide 
that. If we want to move money 
around, we will; if we don’t, we won’t.

July 27, 2022 
In the meantime, let’s pass this bill. 
Let’s give veterans the healthcare they 
have earned. If it isn’t, it is political 
malpractice. What we are doing today 
with this policy, by putting this policy 
off, does nobody any good whatsoever. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would 
briefly and simply reiterate my request 
that our Democratic colleagues, in-
cluding the chairman, who obviously is 
passionate about this, just engage with 
us to fix this, this problem that has 
nothing to do with the bill that he 
wants to pass, this problem that wasn’t 
in the House version of this bill. 
The chairman’s argument that, well, 
it is always ultimately subject to ap-
propriations—well, that is really an ar-
gument that says let’s not have a budg-
et at all, let’s not have any rules be-
cause—it is true—a future Congress 
can always do whatever it wants. So, 
by that logic, we should have no rules, 
no guidelines, no budgets, no proce-
dures, no pay-go, no effort whatsoever 
to have any management of our Fed-
eral budget because—what the hell— 
any Congress can come along and just 
waive it. 
I don’t agree with that. I think, espe-
cially at a time when inflation is run-
ning rampant, when we have been 
spending money like no one has ever 
imagined—if we have got an important 
need, OK; we do that. But this gim-
mick—and the chairman said people 
are sick and tired of games. I totally 
agree. This is one of those games where 
you have got a bill that is going to pass 
and so let’s sneak in this change in the 
budget rule so that it will be easy to 
spend money on other things in the fu-
ture. 
That is ridiculous. That is just not 
defensible. So, again, I would stress 
there is a very easy path to a very big 
vote in favor of this bill that probably 
could happen later tonight but could 
certainly happen tomorrow. And if the 
path is there, let’s fix this problem. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I am 
going to reiterate what I said before. 
The concern that the Senator from 
Pennsylvania has is a concern that 
there is not a lot of trust in this body, 
and I agree—fair reason to be. 
As far as having rules, I believe in 
having rules, but I don’t believe we 
should have rules that tie the hands of 
our standing committees, that say: 
You can’t do this. Appropriations, I 
don’t care what you see, what you see, 
what issue comes down the road for 
veterans—in this case, MARTIN HEIN-
RICH, the chair, and JOHN BOOZMAN, the 
ranking member—you guys can’t ad-
dress it. 
That is what the Senator from Penn-
sylvania wants to do. That is not how 
this process should work. We should be 
dealing with issues as they arise. That 
is a fact. 
And by the way, I have said for some 
time, programs that have outlived 
their lifespan, we should be cutting 
those programs, but we don’t do that 
very well. 
But we have been at war for 20 years. 
With that war—by the way, that was 
all put on a credit card—there was a 
fair amount that was funded by an OCO 
account. And now we are going to say: 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no; we are not 
going to spend the money to take care 
of our veterans. I am going to use this 
as an excuse. I am going to use as an 
excuse the fact that the Appropriations 
Committee might spend too much 
money. 
Well, that is on us. And while that is 
on us, we have veterans dying of can-
cers and lung conditions because a bill 
that should have been passed before the 
Fourth of July is still on the floor 
today. 
You can frame it any way you want. 
But in the end, this budgetary gim-
mick is called: How the Congress 
Works. Appropriators appropriate. If 
you don’t believe me, ask Senator 
SHELBY. That is what we do. And if we 
appropriate too much, this body votes 
it down. Or if we don’t appropriate 
enough, this body votes it down and 
amends it up. That is what appropri-
ators do. That is how this process is 
supposed to work. 
We should not be using that excuse 
to deny benefits to the men and women 
who have served this country in a God- 
awful place in the Middle East. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Georgia 
is recognized. 
f 
SENATOR JOHNNY ISAKSON VA 
REGIONAL OFFICE ACT OF 2022 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize a giant of the great 
State of Georgia—which the Presiding 
Officer and I both have the distinct 
honor of serving—to recognize a true 
legend of the U.S. Senate, an extraor-
dinary father, husband, and representa-
tive of our State, the late Senator 
Johnny Isakson. 
Senator Isakson served Georgia all 
his life. Born in Atlanta, Senator Isak-
son attended the University of Georgia, 
then enlisted in the Georgia Air Na-
tional Guard. He was a successful pri-
vate businessman, growing his real es-
tate enterprise to one of the largest in 
the State. 
He served in both the Georgia House 
of Representatives and the State sen-
ate, and Governor Zell Miller, a Demo-
crat, appointed him, a Republican, to 
chair the State Board of Education. 
In 1999, Senator Isakson was elected 
to the U.S. House of Representatives, 
where he worked to improve American 
K–12 education. 
And in 2004, he was elected to this 
body, where he would serve for almost 
15 years with courtesy, dignity, and 
kindness, supporting and championing 
bipartisan efforts to better serve our 
Nation’s veterans. And his service cul-
minated in his chairmanship of the 
Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs 
and of the Senate Ethics Committee. 
As we will hear from our distin-
guished colleagues who served along-
side Senator Isakson—like 
Senator 
BLUNT—Senator Isakson, through his 
uncommon decency, his generosity of 
spirit, his commitment to integrity 
and service of others over service of 
self, won universal respect in this body; 
won respect in the State of Georgia 
that crossed party lines and earned the 
reputation not just nationally but 
around the world for statesmanship, ef-
fectiveness, and hard work. 
Even more than his work as a states-
man, Senator Isakson was a father and 
a husband. And I want to recognize 
Senator Isakson’s extraordinary fam-
ily, including his wife of more than 50 
years, Dianne; his sons, John and 
Kevin; his daughter Julie—all of whom 
I have had the pleasure of speaking or 
corresponding with in recent months 
and all of whom, in their lives, carry 
on the Senator’s legacy. 
Senator Isakson had a saying that 
there are just two kinds of people in 
this world: friends and future friends. I 
hope we can all be inspired by that as-
piration and that outlook, by his resil-
ient desire to see the good in everyone; 
to see the opportunity to work with 
anyone; to try to find where our inter-
ests align, where we can meet eye to 
eye, where we can get things done to-
gether. 
Senator 
Isakson’s 
courtesy, 
collegiality, and integrity will forever 
serve as an example to all of us who 
serve in this body today and in the fu-
ture. And that is why, in recognition of 
Senator 
Isakson’s 
tremendous 
con-
tributions to American veterans, to the 
State of Georgia, and to the United 
States, it has been my privilege to in-
troduce—alongside my distinguished 
Republican colleague from Missouri, 
Senator BLUNT, and the Presiding Offi-
cer, Senator WARNOCK—the Senator 
Johnny Isakson VA Regional Office 
Act to rename the VA’s Atlanta Re-
gional Office after Senator Isakson as 
part of our Nation’s ongoing recogni-
tion of his service and as an example to 
those who follow in his footsteps of the 
virtues that his representation em-
bodied. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for their support of this 
legislation. We will hear from Senator 
BLUNT and Senator WARNOCK, to share 
their experiences working alongside 
and knowing Senator Isakson, in just a 
moment. 
But now, let’s get this done and take 
this action to demonstrate our endur-
ing respect and admiration for this ex-
traordinary 
American 
statesman, 
Johnny Isakson. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 4359 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title.

SEC. 3. SENATOR JOHNNY ISAKSON DEPART-

LANTA REGIONAL OFFICE. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office in 
Georgia shall, after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, be known and designated 
as the ‘‘Senator Johnny Isakson Department 
of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office’’

(b) REFERENCE.—Any reference in a law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the Regional

deemed to be a reference to the Senator 
Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Atlanta Regional Office. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am glad 
to join you and the other Senator from 
Georgia, Mr. OSSOFF, here today and 
join both of you in sharing some 
thoughts about Senator Isakson. 
Senator OSSOFF has already said a lot 
of things that are easily said. Not that 
they were easy for him to say, but any-
body that knew Johnny Isakson would 
make many of those very same points 
and, hopefully, make them as well. I 
was glad to join him as the original co-
sponsor of this bill. 
Johnny and I served together in the 
House from 1999 until 2005. I was the 
majority whip during most of that 
time. And he was one of the half dozen 
deputies that really are key to getting 
things done. And Johnny Isakson liked 
to get things done. 
In 2005, he came over here to be in 
the Senate and brought that same de-
termination to get things done, to find 
the place—wherever that place was— 
where something could happen. And he 
was a master at making things happen. 
When I joined him in the Senate in 
2011, I was pleased to get a chance to 
serve alongside him again. He was a 
fast friend and a friend that you could 
count on. He knew how to bring people 
together. He did view, as Senator 
OSSOFF
said, people as his current 
friends or people who—the only reason 
they weren’t his friend is they hadn’t 
become his friends yet. And that is 
quite a way to approach life. And John-
ny did it really well. I don’t think 
there was anyone more respected by 
the other Members of the Senate than 
Senator Isakson was. 
In September of last year, I had the 
opportunity to join you, Mr. President, 
along with Senator COONS and Senator 
GRAHAM, in hosting a bipartisan lunch 
that Johnny first started 13 years ago. 
I think we are going to do that again in 
September of this year. We have Demo-
cratic lunches, and we have Republican 
lunches. The Johnny Isakson lunch 
every year was the bipartisan lunch. 
And I think that is a great tradition to 
at least one more time do in honor of 
his service here and his friendship. 
He understood the value of sitting 
down over a cup of coffee or over a 
meal, of talking to one another, of 
finding the things you agree on, and 
then working together. 
And one thing I found here—and I 
think one of the ways I found it was 
watching what Johnny did—when a 
Democratic and Republican Senator 
find something to do together and get 
it done, invariably, they start looking 
for the next thing to do together. And 
their staffs start looking for the next 
thing their bosses can do together. And 
it is an infectious kind of thing that 
gets things done. And that was one of 
the great understandings of the legisla-
tive process that Johnny brought to 
the Senate. 
I think when Johnny was in the 
Georgia House, there were a handful of 
Republicans in the Georgia House when 
he got there. He told me he got to be 
minority leader pretty quickly—maybe 
it was because he didn’t show up in the 
room that day before they could choose 
who their leader was going to be. But 
he understood what it took to bring 
things together. He liked to help peo-
ple. He liked to get things done. He es-
pecially liked to get things done for his 
fellow veterans. 
Now, we are going to approach this 
veterans issue this week. And I am sure 
we are going to get it done. We just had 
a discussion about veterans and our 
commitments 
to 
veterans. 
But 
as 
chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, Johnny really led efforts par-
ticularly to increase accountability at 
the VA. And there was an account-
ability problem at the VA that Johnny 
was intent on making sure we got to 
the bottom of it, to be sure that vet-
erans received the care that they were 
entitled to and the benefits they had 
earned. 
Under his leadership, Congress also 
passed a MISSION Act, legislation that 
gave veterans real and permanent 
choice in their healthcare. This is 
something that particularly younger 
veterans care about. They want to go 
to the doctor that they want to go to. 
They want to go to a doctor close to 
home, or they want to still have the 
option, as they would have, to go to a 
veterans facility or be referred from 
that facility to another place where 
their care would be more easily avail-
able to them. 
But what veterans really want was 
the idea of having not just a pilot 
project on choice, which was the case

before Johnny Isakson as chairman de-
cided, no, we are going to have a per-
manent process where veterans are 
going to have those choices in the fu-
ture. And so here we have just passed 
legislation designed to designate the 
VA facility in Decatur, GA, the Sen-
ator Johnny Isakson Department of 
Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Of-
fice. 
I am certainly proud to join my col-
leagues today as we sought and re-
ceived unanimous consent for this leg-
islation to pass. I really can’t think of 
a more fitting way today, as we talk 
about veterans, to honor Johnny’s leg-
acy than to have his name associated 
with an issue he cared deeply about. 
Another issue he and I cared about 
and worked closely on was health re-
search and what was happening at the 
CDC. There will be a building—the 
ground is being broken right now, as I 
understand it, for a building—at the 
CDC headquarters in Atlanta that will 
also be named for Johnny Isakson. 
Those are two very fitting areas of 
focus for what he did for the people in 
Georgia, what he did for veterans in 
Georgia, what he did for healthcare in 
Georgia, and what he did for all of 
those things as it related to the entire 
U.S.A. I am glad to see this legislation 
pass. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to honor a 
friend, our late Senator from Georgia, 
my predecessor, Senator Johnny Isak-
son, as we work across the aisle, just as 
he did, to rename the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Of-
fice in his honor. 
I thank my brother and fellow Sen-
ator from Georgia for leading this ef-
fort. 
Without a doubt, Senator Isakson 
loved Georgia, and he cared deeply for 
our country. He was a patriot, a public 
servant, and I am proud to say that 
there are members of my staff who 
used to work for Johnny Isakson. They 
will tell you that he never hesitated to 
show up. 
In my other job as a pastor, I talk 
often about the ministry of presence. 
Sometimes, it is not about what you 
say, because there are some situations, 
quite frankly, for which there are no 
adequate words. When someone has 
lost a loved one, and you are standing 
there at graveside or standing in a hos-
pital at bedside with a patient, some-
times the issue is really showing up— 
the ministry of presence. 
Johnny Isakson had it. He knew how 
to show up. Whether it was paying a 
visit to an ill patient or seeing a dis-
abled veteran, he was there. Senator 
Isakson, the consummate public serv-
ant, dedicated his years of service to 
our beloved Georgia, to veterans, to 
our families, and to our children. 
He always made it a point to show up 
at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Every 
year in January, as we celebrate Geor-
gia’s greatest son, the Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Johnny Isak-
son, without fail, was always in the 
house. Now, to be sure, when the King 
holiday rolls around, politicians do 
tend to show up, but what was so im-
pressive about Johnny Isakson is that, 
not only did he show up for the service, 
he stayed for the whole service—a serv-
ice which, I will admit, is long, even by 
Baptist standards. He stayed there the 
whole time. 
He was unafraid to work across ideo-
logical and political differences in our 
State, in our country. I shall never for-
get his example of public service. 
We talked from time to time. In fact, 
it occurs to me that the first time I 
stood in this Chamber, I stood not as a 
Senator but as Chaplain of the day, and 
it was at Johnny Isakson’s invitation. I 
remember his graciousness on that day 
and on so many occasions. 
When he announced his retirement, 
he called me and said: Raphael, I am 
retiring, and I want to drop by Ebe-
nezer and say goodbye. 
When he came that Sunday, he asked 
the members of our church who are 
veterans to stand. As he looked across 
the audience and saw all the veterans 
who were in our church, he said: I want 
to leave a special offering for the vet-
erans ministry in this church. 
That was Johnny Isakson. 
So I am thrilled that today, with 
great appreciation and admiration for 
Senator Johnny Isakson, our bipar-
tisan legislation honors his life and his 
legacy by renaming the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Of-
fice in his honor, and I am thrilled that 
it has passed in the Senate in a bipar-
tisan way with unanimous support. 
Isn’t that fitting? Johnny Isakson is 
doing now in death what he did in life— 
bringing us together. And in this mo-
ment in which we are in a debate about 
what to do for our veterans, isn’t it ap-
propriate that his spirit summons us to 
common 
ground—and 
the 
higher 
ground—so that we can do all we can 
for those who have our back in dan-
gerous places all over the globe. 
Senator Isakson cared deeply for 
Georgia’s veterans and for veterans all 
across our country. He understood that 
there are some things bigger than poli-
tics. So we recognize his amazing serv-
ice, his incredible legacy of life and 
self-sacrifice by renaming the Atlanta 
Regional Office of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs in his honor. 
I am proud to sit in the seat where he 
sat, and it is my honor to help lead the 
passage of this bipartisan piece of leg-
islation that will help preserve the leg-
acy of our late and dear friend. 
Long live the spirit of Johnny Isak-
son.

Whereas actions by the Government of the 
Russian Federation against civilian centers, 
such as Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, left 
countless innocent men, women, and children 
dead or wounded; 
Whereas, since 2014, the Government of the 
Russian Federation has supported so-called sep-
aratists engaging in acts of violence against 
Ukrainian civilians in the Donbas region; 
Whereas, since the entry of the Russian Fed-
eration into the Syrian Civil War in 2015, the 
Russian Federation has targeted innocent civil-
ians in Syria with attacks on civilian markets, 
medical facilities, and schools; 
Whereas the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration provides material support to Syria, a na-
tion currently designated as a state sponsor of 
terrorism, that has been used to target the Syr-
ian people; 
Whereas the Russian Federation spreads ter-
ror throughout the world through private mili-
tary networks of mercenaries, such as the Wag-
ner Group, in an effort to project power cheaply

states that ‘‘Wagner’s activities in other coun-
tries, including Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, and 
Libya, have generated insecurity and incited vi-
olence against innocent civilians’’;

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO PHYLLIS GREEN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is not 
often one gets to experience and cele-
brate a living legend. But we have a 
chance today to do with a member of 
our Senate family. On February 27, 
1984, an important part of the Senate 
community opened: the Senate Em-
ployees Child Care Center. There for 
that historic opening was a very spe-
cial teacher, Ms. Phyllis Green. 
Over the ensuing nearly four decades, 
Phyllis masterfully impacted the lives 
of 
so 
many 
students 
that 
passed 
through center. She helped them get 
started in their young, tender lives 
with humor, warmth, devotion, skill, 
and of course, great patience. 
She is also something of a legend 
among the families on my staff whose 
children had the privilege of being 
taught by her—Wren, Rayn, Alex, Leo, 
Oliver, Avery, and Harry—so much so 
that even the ones who didn’t have her 
for a teacher knew of her class. It is 
hard to imagine, but students that 
were in her early classes are now in 
their 40s. 
Some years ago, during her 30th an-
niversary at the center, a number of 
former students, now adults, came 
back to celebrate with her, and there 
wasn’t a dry eye in the room. Think 
about how many of us had a teacher 
who made an impact in our lives and 
the rare opportunity to go back as an 
adult to offer warm thanks for those 
memories. What a gift to reflect upon 
so many lives impacted during one’s 
career, so much so that Phyllis’s col-
leagues said during her final week that 
‘‘the Legendary, the one and only Ms. 
Phyllis is retiring.’’ 
In fact, one of them wrote a poem 
that aptly noted of Phyllis, ‘‘Your pa-
tience, knowledge and guidance opened 
up so much potential. For the children 
and the parents, your being has been 
essential. . . . In the eyes of many, you 
are a living legend, A pillar of our com-
munity, an educator, a teammate, a 
friend.’’ 
On the 30th anniversary of the child 
care center, the former Senator Tom 
Harkin described its teachers and ad-
ministrators ‘‘as some of the unsung 
heroes 
of 
the 
Senate.’’ 
I 
whole-
heartedly agree and certainly Phyllis 
Green is one such hero. 
I thank Phyllis for her incredible 
service to nearly four decades of Sen-
ate employee families and their chil-
dren. You have made a real impact on 
our world. 
f 
REMEMBERING BUCK O’NEIL AND 
MINNIE MINOSO 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at long 
last, it is official. Buck O’Neil and Min-
nie Minoso are finally where they de-
serve to be: in the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame. 
These two remarkable men, who were 
friends for decades, both started their 
careers in baseball’s storied Negro 
Leagues. They went on to make his-
tory again in the Major Leagues—in 
the city of Chicago—and they stayed 
involved with baseball all their lives. 
And they were both known, as one 
writer said, ‘‘as much for their grace 
and spirit of generosity as for their im-
mense achievements in the game.’’ 
I never had the good fortune to meet 
Buck O’Neil, but I have a baseball that 
he signed, and I keep it as a treasure. 
I did meet Minnie Minoso. He and 
Satchel Paige came to a Springfield 
Redbirds game many years ago, and I 
summoned the courage to shake their 
hands between innings. What a thrill 
that was. But meeting Minnie Minoso 
was an honor shared by so many 
Chicagoans. 
As his widow, Sharon Rice-Minoso, 
recalled at the Hall of Fame induction 
ceremony, ‘‘Baseball was his life. He 
was proud to wear his uniform and 
come to the ballpark every day to 
greet fans with a smile and sign auto-
graph and after autograph. Some peo-
ple believe that Minnie signed an auto-
graph for every man, woman, and child 
in the Windy City.’’ 
‘‘The Cuban Comet’’ and ‘‘Mr. White 
Sox.’’ That is what the fans called him. 
His full name was Saturnino Orestes 
Armas Minoso Arrieta. He was born on 
a sugarcane ranch in Cuba in 1923—or 
maybe it was 1924 or ‘25. He was a little 
fuzzy on his age. 
He was a two-time All-Star in the 
Negro Leagues before becoming the 
first Black player for the Chicago 
White Sox in 1951 and the first Latino 
star in Major League Baseball, the 
Jackie Robinson of Latino ballplayers. 
He was one of the best hitters in the 
American League in the 1950s, a seven- 
time All-Star while with the White Sox 
and Cleveland Indians. 
He hit over .300 eight times, led the 
American League in stolen bases three 
times, hammered double-digit home 
runs almost every season, and won 
three Gold Gloves in left field. 
He retired in 1964—or so it seemed. 
Twelve years later, when Minnie was 
50, the White Sox called him back for 
three games. He hit a line drive to left 
field, making him one of the oldest 
players in MLB history to score a base 
hit. 
The White Sox retired his No. 9 in 
1983, and he remained close to the orga-
nization and its players until he died in 
2015. 
Baseball analysts have long consid-
ered his omission from Cooperstown a 
glaring error. Now, finally, it has been 
set right. 
Buck O’Neil was a two-time All-Star 
first baseman with the Negro Leagues 
Kansas City Monarchs. He went on to 
be a scout for the Chicago Cubs, the 
first Black coach in Major League 
Baseball, and one of the most beloved 
ambassadors for baseball in the sport’s 
history. 
He was born John Jordan O’Neil, Jr., 
in Florida in 1911, the grandson son of 
an enslaved man. He joined the Mon-
archs in 1938 and was a star player in 
the 1940s and ‘50s. As a first baseman, 
he was known for his smooth glove 
work, but he could also handle a bat. 
He was a three-time All-Star and be-
came a Negro World Series champion 
in 1942. 
In 1943, at the height of World War II, 
he enlisted in the Navy and served for 
2 years, including time in the Pacific. 
He returned to the Monarchs after the 
war and was the Negro League’s bat-
ting champ his first year out of the 
service. In 1948, the Monarchs pro-
moted him to player-manager. Among 
the many players whose careers he 
helped shape was a shy young shortstop 
who would go on to become the first 
African-American player for the Chi-
cago Cubs, ‘‘Mr. Cub,’’ Ernie Banks. 
After the Monarchs were sold in 1955, 
Buck found work as a scout for the 
Cubs. Players he signed as a scout with 
Chicago—and later, the Kansas City 
Royals—included Lou Brock, Oscar 
Gamble, Lee Smith, and Joe Carter. He 
made history when the Cubs hired him 
as a coach in 1962, making him the first 
Black coach in the American or Na-
tional League. 
In 1990, Buck O’Neil began what 
would become perhaps his greatest con-
tribution to baseball. With a handful of 
others, he founded the Negro Leagues 
Baseball Museum in Kansas City, just 
blocks from where he had played with 
the Monarchs and where Rube Foster 
had founded the Negro Leagues in 1920. 
He devoted the rest of his life to 
baseball and especially keeping alive 
the memories of the Negro Leagues. He 
helped build the Negro Leagues Mu-
seum from one room to a 10,000-square- 
foot showplace. He traveled widely, 
using his grace and wit to tell the sto-
ries of Negro League stars such as Josh 
Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard, 
Oscar Charleston, and his old Monarchs 
teammate, Satchel Paige. 
In 1994, not long after the World Se-
ries was canceled because of a labor 
dispute, Ken Burns’ nine-part PBS se-
ries ‘‘Baseball’’ introduced Buck O’Neil 
to an even larger audience. He became 
the beloved Bard of Baseball. 
Also inducted into Cooperstown last 
weekend were: David Ortiz, ‘‘Big Papi,’’ 
the slugger who led the Boston Red Sox 
to three World Series Championships; 
Gil Hodges, All-Star first baseman for 
the Brooklyn Dodgers and manager of 
the 1969 ‘‘Miracle Mets;’’ Tony Oliva 
and Jim Kaat, two teammates from the

1965 pennant-winning Minnesota Twins; 
and Bud Fowler, born in 1858 and often 
regarded as the first Black professional 
baseball player. 
Minnie Minoso and Buck O’Neil were 
voted in under new rules that officially 
designated the Negro Leagues as a 
major league in 2020. 
Buck had been nominated once be-
fore—in 2006—but to the surprise of 
nearly everyone, fell one vote short. He 
accepted the verdict with his usual 
grace, even agreeing to speak on behalf 
of the 17 players who made it into 
Cooperstown that year. 
With this typical optimism, he told 
the crowd gathered at Cooperstown 
that day, ‘‘I’ve done a lot of things I 
liked doing, but I’d rather be right 
here, right now, representing these 
people who helped build a bridge across 
the chasm of prejudice.’’ 
Minnie 
Minoso 
and 
Buck 
O’Neil 
helped build that bridge, too. And now, 
they are finally where they deserve to 
be, among baseball’s immortals.

TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF STEVE 
SPARROW 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
over the past two decades, one man has 
revolutionized law enforcement in Ken-
tucky’s Oldham County and built a 
reputation as one of the Common-
wealth’s best sheriffs. Steve Sparrow 
has served as Oldham County’s sheriff 
since 1999 and, in his time leading the 
county’s police force, has brought pro-
fessionalism, dedication, and, above 
all, devotion to the rule of law to his 
community. This year, Sheriff Sparrow 
is retiring from his post. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring his ca-
reer and the lasting legacy he built in 
Oldham County. 
Sheriff Sparrow began his career in 
law enforcement nearly 50 years ago, at 
a time when Oldham County’s popu-
lation was less than a quarter of its 
current size. As this burgeoning com-
munity expanded into one of Ken-
tucky’s fastest growing counties, Sher-
iff Sparrow’s leadership helped Oldham 
County maintain its reputation for 
safety and neighborliness. Under his 
purview, the area remains one of the 
most desirable places to live in the 
Commonwealth. 
Sheriff Sparrow didn’t achieve this 
high level of law enforcement efficacy 
by accident. As sheriff, he dedicated 
himself 
to 
furthering 
professional 
training for both himself and his de-
partment. He is the only sheriff in 
Oldham County history to have trained 
at a certified law enforcement academy 
and the only Oldham County sheriff to 
have graduated from the National 
Sheriff’s Institute. He brought similar 
high levels of training to his depart-
ment, making Oldham County Sheriff’s 
Office the fifth in the Commonwealth 
to achieve accreditation standards. 
In recognition of Sheriff Sparrow’s 
hard work to improve Oldham County’s 
police department, the Kentucky Sher-
iff’s Association named Sheriff Spar-
row their president in both 2005 and 
2012. He received additional praise and 
leadership roles from Kentucky’s Gov-
ernor, the Kentucky Law Enforcement 
Board of Directors, and the National 
Sheriff’s Association Board of Direc-
tors. 
Oldham 
County 
voters 
also 
strongly approved of Sheriff Sparrow’s 
performance, reelecting him to his of-
fice six times in a row. 
Leaders around the Commonwealth 
will be sad to see Sheriff Sparrow leave 
his role. He has been one of my closest 
partners in the law enforcement com-
munity, and I have been proud to lean 
on his expertise to back the blue at the 
Federal level. Though we will all miss 
Sheriff Sparrow’s leadership, I know he 
will put his retirement to good use, 
spending more time with his wife 
Dotty and their children and grand-
children. On behalf of the Senate, I 
share our congratulations with Sheriff 
Sparrow for achieving this milestone 
and wish him the best in this next 
chapter of his life.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I pre-
viously revised the allocations, aggre-
gates, and pay-as-you-go ledger for S. 
2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, pursuant to section 3003 of S. Con. 
Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 congres-
sional budget resolution.

ing the PAYGO adjustment I made in 
June. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying table, which provides de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, had 
there been a recorded vote, I would 
have voted no on the confirmation of 
Executive Calendar No. 1058, Adair

be United States Attorney for the Dis-
trict of South Carolina for the term of 
four years. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID P. 
PEKOSKE 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs has reviewed the 
nomination of David P. Pekoske to be 
the Administrator of the Transpor-
tation Security Administration, De-
partment of Homeland Security. See-
ing that this is Mr. Pekoske’s nomina-
tion for a second consecutive term to 
be the Administrator of the Transpor-
tation Security Administration, the 
chairman and ranking member have 
reached a unanimous consent agree-
ment to forgo a mark up for this nomi-
nee. 
In the 115th Congress, the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs sought referral in June 
of 2017 for Mr. Pekoske’s first nomina-
tion to be the Administrator of the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion. The committee held a hearing for 
this nominee on June 11, 2017, and re-
ported the nominee out of committee 
favorably on June 19, 2017. In the fu-
ture, this committee is likely to seek 
referral 
on 
this 
nomination. 
This 
should be considered the standard pro-
cedure for future nominations to this 
role.

MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
Thru: Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff 
From: General Kenneth F. McKenzie, Jr., 
Commander, U.S. Central Command 
Subject: Abbey Gate AR 15–6 Investigation 
MR. SECRETARY, I have reviewed the AR 15– 
6 investigation completed at my direction by 
U.S. Army Central (ARCENT) and concur 
with and endorse its findings and rec-
ommendations. The investigation was excep-
tionally comprehensive in its scope, as ap-
propriate to the tragic events that precip-
itated its initiation. The investigating team, 
led by BG Lance Curtis, conducted 70 sepa-
rate interviews, many of which were held in 
a group setting to facilitate a free flow of in-
formation. A total of 139 people were inter-
viewed at seven different locations spanning 
five countries. Interviews ranged from be-
tween one hour and six hours in duration, 
with the average interview lasting between 
two and three hours, and the average tran-
scription totaling nearly 11 pages. I specifi-
cally concur that: 
The task organization worked. This was in 
large part due to pre-existing or quickly 
forged relationships among leaders at the 
highest echelons and adaptability at the 
lower echelons; 
By 25 August 2021, Abbey Gate was the 
main effort for ‘‘walk-up’’ gate operations at 
Hamid Karzai International Airport; 
There was no complex attack; it was a sin-
gle suicide bomber not accompanied by 
enemy small arms fire; 
There is no evidence that Afghans were 
killed by return fire from U.S. forces in the 
immediate aftermath of the attack; 
The attack was not preventable at the tac-
tical level without degrading the mission to 
maximize the number of evacuees; 
The attack was not the result of any act of 
omission or commission by forces on the 
ground; 
The wounds sustained by the service mem-
bers Killed in Action were so catastrophic 
that none could be saved; and 
Although not assigned as a task to 
ARCENT or the investigating team, it is my 
judgment that all injuries sustained by U.S. 
personnel incident to the Abbey Gate attack 
occurred in the line of duty and were not due 
to any misconduct by the killed or injured 
U.S. personnel. 
I further concur with the recommendations 
detailed in the ARCENT investigation. Ac-
cordingly, I have directed the following ac-
tions: 
The Findings and Recommendations will 
be forwarded to all USCENTCOM Service 
Component Commanders to ensure that all 
U.S. servicemembers at Abbey Gate during 
the attack, and present in any of the blast 
zones detailed in the investigation, are af-
forded the opportunity to be evaluated for 
Traumatic Brain Injury (Recommendation 
(a)); 
The Findings and Recommendations will 
be forwarded to all USCENTCOM Service 
Component 
Commanders 
to 
facilitate 
prioritized access to appropriate mental 
health evaluations for personnel involved in 
executing entry control point operations 
from 17–26 August and personnel involved in 
the medical response to the attack on 26 Au-
gust (Recommendation (b)); 
The investigation will be forwarded to the 
Joint Staff to inform any efforts that might 
be undertaken to develop interagency doc-
trine for Noncombatant Evacuation Oper-
ations (Recommendation (c)); and 
Relevant portions of the investigation will 
be forwarded to U.S. Marine Corps Forces 
Central for appropriate action regarding the 
potential serious injury or death of an Af-
ghan civilian on or about 20 August 2021 re-
sulting from the alleged improper deploy-
ment of a flash bang grenade by a U.S. Ma-
rine from 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regi-
ment (Recommendation (d)). 
Based on the totality of the facts and cir-
cumstances detailed in the ARCENT inves-
tigation, I do not believe that any adverse 
administrative or disciplinary action is nec-
essary or appropriate for any U.S. personnel 
involved in our operations at Abbey Gate. 
The ARCENT investigating team and the 
ARCENT 
Commander, 
LTG 
Ron 
Clark, 
briefed me in person on 11 November 2021 re-
garding this investigation. The presentation 
was as comprehensive as the investigation 
itself, and it included detailed PowerPoint 
slides, embedded video, and exceptionally 
well 
scripted 
speaker 
notes 
that 
com-
plemented the written investigation and fa-
cilitated an informative exchange of ques-
tions and answers. I highly recommend you 
take the brief in person, and set aside two 
hours to this purpose. If you concur, my 
headquarters will work with your staff to 
make the ARCENT team available.

TRIBUTE TO PAT AND SHARON 
O’TOOLE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, at 
the 110th Wyoming State Fair, Senator 
LUMMIS and I will have the pleasure of 
introducing Pat and Sharon O’Toole as 
2022 inductees to the Wyoming Agri-
culture Hall of Fame. 
Pat and Sharon O’Toole are ranchers 
who, along with their family, own and 
operate the Ladder Ranch. It is a large- 
scale cattle and sheep operation, estab-
lished in 1881 by A.W. and Anna Louise 
Salisbury. This was 9 years before Wyo-
ming became a State. The Ladder 
Ranch has been in Sharon’s family for 
six generations. Located outside of 
Savery, WY, along the Little Snake 
River, the ranch straddles the State 
line with Colorado. 
Pat met Sharon Salisbury while they 
both attended Colorado State Univer-
sity. Following marriage, they re-
turned to Sharon’s family ranch in 1977 
where they went to work managing the 
ranch and raising a family. Since then, 
Pat and Sharon have been shining ex-
amples of resource conservation, land 
stewardship, and partnership develop-
ment. 
The conservation legacy of the Lad-
der Ranch will affect agriculture, wild-
life, and water for generations to come. 
Their ranch is host to one of North 
America’s largest elk herds. It provides 
habitat for mule deer, sage grouse, and 
fish. They participate in the Sage 
Grouse Initiative, the Conservation 
Stewardship Program, and the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife’s Partners for Fish 
and Wildlife program. They also have a 
stretch of land along Battle Creek rec-
ognized as an Audubon Bird Area. 
In addition to managing a successful 
cattle and sheep operation for 45 years, 
Pat served in the Wyoming Legislature 
for three terms from 1986–1992. He is 
the current president of the Family 
Farm Alliance, representing irrigators 
in 17 Western States. The alliance en-
sures the availability of reliable, af-
fordable irrigation supplies to Western 
farmers and ranchers. 
Pat is a strong advocate for efficient 
irrigation and effective management 
tools for agriculture. He has testified 
many times before committees in the 
U.S. House of Representatives and the 
U.S. Senate. As the ranking member of 
the Senate Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources, I invited him to 
testify in June 2022. Pat spoke on solu-
tions to extreme drought in the West-
ern United States. 
Pat gives his time to numerous orga-
nizations including AGree, which ad-
dresses international food and agri-
culture policies. He also serves on the 
boards of the Intermountain Joint Ven-
ture, Partners for Conservation, Farm 
Foundation, and Solutions from the 
Land. President Clinton appointed him 
to the Western Water Policy Review 
Advisory Commission in 1997. 
In addition to full-time ranching, 
Sharon is a published author and writ-
er. Her work has been featured in the 
Washington Post. She has a monthly

column in the Shepherd magazine. She 
currently blogs on western issues and 
life for the Western Folklife Center. 
She is an avid poet, having performed 
at the National Cowboy Poetry Gath-
ering. She was chosen to write the 
poem featured at the Wyoming Stock 
Growers 150th anniversary celebration. 
Her writing includes two children’s 
books, highlighting the connections be-
tween family and the land. 
Among many prestigious awards, the 
O’Toole family and the Ladder Ranch 
were awarded the Wyoming Leopold 
Environmental Stewardship Award in 
2014. Two years later, the ranch re-
ceived the Wyoming Stock Growers 
Land Trust Kurt Bucholz Conservation 
Award. 
The Ladder Ranch is truly a family 
endeavor. Pat and Sharon’s three chil-
dren all contribute to the success of 
the operation. Their daughter Meghan 
O’Toole Lally works full-time on the 
ranch with help from her husband 
Brian and their four children. The 
O’Toole’s son, Eamon O’Toole, his wife 
Megan and their two sons, also reside 
on the ranch, working alongside the 
family. 
Their 
daughter, 
Bridget 
O’Toole and her husband Chris Abel 
help with the ranch from their home in 
Arizona. 
Pat and Sharon O’Toole’s unmatched 
passion for family, Wyoming agri-
culture, wildlife and animal conserva-
tion, 
and 
cultivating 
partnerships, 
makes them an outstanding choice for 
the 
Wyoming 
Agriculture 
Hall 
of 
Fame. It is a great honor to participate 
in their induction. They continue to 
represent Wyoming and Western inter-
ests with dedication and distinction. 
My wife, Bobbi, joins me in congratu-
lating Pat and Sharon O’Toole as 2022 
inductees into the Wyoming Agri-
culture Hall of Fame.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
VAN 
BUREN 
LIONS 
CLUB’S 
100 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize and congratulate the Van 
Buren Lions Club as it celebrates 100 
years of service to western Arkansas. 
The Van Buren Lions Club was char-
tered on October 10, 1922, only 5 years 
after the creation of Lions Club Inter-
national. Since its founding, its mem-
bers have committed themselves to 
making a difference in the lives of peo-
ple in the community and around the 
world. 
While it began as a club to support 
local causes and provide networking 
for businessmen, a larger mission came 
into focus after Helen Keller spoke at 
the Lions Club International conven-
tion in 1925. She challenged all Lions to 
be ‘‘Knights of the Blind’’ and her elo-
quent plea transformed the organiza-
tion, making support of sight-related 
programs the group’s primary mission. 
Throughout its 100-year history, the 
Van Buren Lions Club has worked tire-
lessly to make a difference for this 
cause. It hosts annual fundraisers and 
works with area eye doctors to recycle 
glasses, donating them to people who 
cannot afford them. In addition, mem-
bers support local eye examination pro-
grams as well as the Arkansas Eye 
Bank and Laboratory, Lions World 
Services 
for 
the 
Blind, 
Mid-South 
Sight and Hearing Service, Leader 
Dogs for the Blind, Lions Clubs Inter-
national Foundation, Diabetes Edu-
cation and Prevention, Sight First, and 
the Lions of Arkansas Foundation. 
As an optometrist, I am proud of the 
great work done by this club and Lions 
chapters around the world. I congratu-
late the Van Buren Lions Club on its 
100th 
anniversary 
and 
hope 
these 
Knights for the Blind continue to pros-
per in their mission for years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO BILL MILLS 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
the retirement of one of the leaders in 
water policy from the great State of 
Montana. Mr. Bill Mills is retiring 
after 57 years as a giant in Montana’s 
water industry and as a respected lead-
er nationally. 
Bill retired from the Air Force in 1965 
and spent the next 12 years in the pump 
industry, focusing on the water busi-
ness. In 1977, he formed the 2M Com-
pany in Billings, MT, with a $10,000 
loan from his aunt and an SBA loan. 
His goal was to provide ‘‘legendary’’ 
service and support to the water well 
contractors and pump installers that 
provide 
water 
to 
homes, 
farms, 
ranches, and businesses throughout 
Montana. From those humble begin-
nings, he formed a 14-branch operation 
that covered the Rocky Mountain 
States and the Pacific Northwest. Bill 
served on the Water System Council 
Board in the 1990s and was a force be-
hind Federal investment in programs 
to address rural residential and agri-
cultural water issues. 
In 2006, Bill expanded his vision and 
focus globally by helping form Water 4 
Kids, an international organization 
that provides permanent, safe drinking 
water solutions for at-risk commu-
nities. To date, Water 4 Kids Inter-
national has positively impacted over 
3,000,000 lives in communities in Ugan-
da, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, 
Liberia, Rwanda, and the Philippines. 
In 2008, Bill was recognized as Mon-
tana’s Small Business Person of the 
Year. 
In 2017, one of Bill’s oldest and most 
trusted 
manufacturing 
partners, 
Franklin Electric, acquired 2M and 
other leading water equipment dis-
tributors around the country to form 
the Headwater Companies. Bill served 
on Headwater’s board of advisers until 
April of this year. 
Please join me in congratulating Bill 
on a remarkable career that has posi-
tively impacted hundreds of employees, 
thousands of water industry profes-
sionals and helped provide millions of 
people with clean, reliable sources of 
water around the world.∑

REMEMBERING THOMAS 
TRESSELT 
∑ Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and memory of 
a dear friend, Thomas Tresselt, who 
passed away on July 12 in Hartford. 
Tom was an American classic. He 
grew up in Indiana where he was the 
star of his high school’s basketball 
team before taking his talents to Yale 
University. In his first year, he scored 
16 points on future NBA player, U.S. 
Senator, and Presidential candidate 
Bill Bradley’s Princeton team. While 
he was not destined for the NBA, he 
never lost his love of basketball. In the 
early 80s—before computers were com-
monplace—he and a friend started their 
law firm’s March Madness pool, pro-
viding comprehensive round-by-round 
standings, calculated manually using 
brackets drawn by hand. 
Tom went on to the University of 
Michigan Law School where he married 
the love of his life, Sally. Sally and 
Tom would be married for 57 years. 
Following law school, Tom was com-
missioned an officer in the U.S. Navy, 
where he served in Beachmaster Unit 2 
from 1969 to 1971. After the Navy, Tom 
and Sally moved to San Francisco 
where Tom worked as a litigator for 
Orrick, Herrington, Rowley, and Sut-
cliffe. 
‘‘Tired of always arguing for a liv-
ing,’’ Tom moved back to Connecticut, 
the place he and his family would call 
home for the next nearly 50 years. 
From 1974 to 1977, he was assistant 
dean of Yale Law School before joining 
Shipman and Goodman, where he prac-
ticed corporate law until 2008. 
A leader in every sense of the word, 
Tom was an extremely active member 
of his community. At Asylum Hill Con-
gregation Church, he served as moder-
ator, was cochair of the capital cam-
paign, served on the board of Christian 
service, was a deacon, and performed in 
the Boar’s Head Festival as a king, log 
carrier, Beefeater, and other roles for 
nearly 20 years. He also served on the 
board of Loaves and Fishes, the Amer-
ican School for the Deaf, and Leader-
ship Greater Hartford—3rd Age Initia-
tive. 
I knew Tom as a great friend and co-
worker of my father who, like Tom, 
made Shipman and Goodwin his work 
home for five decades. To me, Tom was 
a legend. Thoughtful and kind, with 
this big, booming, smiling personality 
that drew people to him. That person 
in your life that everyone just wants to 
be around. He was a man of action who 
led by example and was committed to 
his country, his family, and his com-
munity. 
Tom battled Alzheimer’s at the end 
of his life, but never lost his sense of 
humor, compassion, and love for his 
family and friends. 
I only wish I could have known him 
better. But I knew him well enough to

TRIBUTE TO BISHOP TIMOTHY J. 
CLARKE 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Bishop Timothy J. 
Clarke on 40 years of servant leader-
ship to the congregation at First 
Church of God in Columbus, OH, as 
well as to the broader Columbus com-
munity and the State of Ohio. 
Bishop Clarke came to Columbus in 
1982 after serving as associate minister 
at First Church of God in his home-
town of Far Rockaway, NY, and as pas-
tor at York Avenue Church of God in 
Warren, OH. He has grown First Church 
of God into one of the largest min-
istries in Ohio and is known across 
Ohio and the Nation for his spiritual 
leadership and ability to help bring 
people together to address many of the 
challenges facing our communities. 
Bishop Clarke is also the founder and 
chief prelate of the Berean Fellowship, 
an international assembly that part-
ners and mentors pastors of small to 
mid-size churches and those who are 
new to the ministry. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with Bishop Clarke for a dozen years. I 
have benefited from his spiritual guid-
ance and worked with him on efforts to 
battle 
addiction 
and 
human 
traf-
ficking. He has also provided valuable 
counsel on our efforts to reduce recidi-
vism and help people exiting our crimi-
nal justice system get jobs and get 
their lives back on track. 
My wife Jane and I have had the 
privilege of joining Bishop Clarke and 
First Lady Clytemnestra Clarke at

leave inspired and rejuvenated from his

724—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
THE 
HISTORIC 
DEFINITION OF A RECESSION IS 
2 
NEGATIVE 
QUARTERS 
OF 
GROSS 
DOMESTIC 
PRODUCT 
GROWTH 
Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mr. SCOTT of 
South Carolina, and Ms. LUMMIS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs: 
S. RES. 724 
Whereas, globally, the most commonly 
used and widely accepted definition of reces-
sion is 2 negative quarters of gross domestic 
product growth; 
Whereas most of the recessions in the 
United States identified by the National Bu-
reau of Economic Research have consisted of 
2 negative quarters of gross domestic prod-
uct growth and in each of the last 10 in-
stances in which there have been 2 or more 
such quarters, a recession was officially de-
clared; 
Whereas use of the historic definition of a 
recession by the Federal Government has 
been important for purposes of economic 
study and analysis, historic comparisons, 
and policy making: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the Federal Government should con-
tinue to use the historic definition of a re-
cession.

Whereas, when it appears that evidence 
under the control or in the possession of the 
Senate may promote the administration of 
justice, the Senate will take such action as 
will promote the ends of justice consistent 
with the privileges of the Senate: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That Aidan Gavin, and any other 
current or former employee of Senator

CELEBRATING THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF NORMAN LEAR 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, happily, I 
rise today in celebration of the 100th birthday 
of a towering titan of American television, a 
patriotic champion of our civil liberties and a 
dear friend to many in the Congress: the leg-
endary Norman Lear. 
Over his long and storied career, Norman 
has been a singular force in shaping our na-
tion’s culture. From the Golden Age of TV to 
the Streaming Age of today, from our tele-
vision sets to the silver screen, he has chal-
lenged our nation to grapple with issues of 
power, privilege and prejudice, long consid-
ered taboo. In doing so, he has helped break 
down barriers between our communities, while 
inspiring generations of Americans with his 
magnificent and moving artistry. 
Born a century ago in New Haven, Con-
necticut, Norman Lear was raised in a family 
that took immense pride in their Jewish herit-
age and values. Even as a child, Norman 
dared to dream of a world where diversity was 
not merely tolerated, but celebrated. Driven by 
this vision, he dropped out of college at just 
twenty years old to enlist in the United States 
Air Force and join the fight against fascism. 
He bravely flew 52 combat missions in the Eu-
ropean theater—and for his valiant, patriotic 
service, he was awarded the distinguished Air 
Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters. 
After fighting for freedom across the Atlan-
tic, Norman returned to the United States to 
carry on his mission of advancing liberty, jus-
tice and equality through American culture. A 
gifted writer and a masterful storyteller, he cre-
ated many of television’s most iconic sitcoms: 
including from All in the Family to Sanford and 
Son, from Maude to The Jeffersons. Refusing 
to be satisfied with merely commercial suc-
cess, he used his commanding platform and 
trademark wit to speak truth to power. His 
groundbreaking scripts and unforgettable char-
acters breathed new life into essential discus-
sions of racism, sexism, homophobia and 
more—sparking similar conversations in living 
rooms across the country. Our nation is grate-
ful that, even at 100 years old, Norman con-
tinues to bless us with his sharp insights and 
creative brilliance today. 
At the same time, Norman’s impact was not 
simply confined to the writer’s room. His unre-
lenting love of America is legendary, as dem-
onstrated when he purchased an original copy 
of the Declaration of Independence and sent it 
around the country—so all of America, in its 
beautiful diversity, could bear witness to and 
celebrate our founding document. 
Norman’s 
deep 
patriotism 
has 
helped 
strengthen our Democracy. As the founder of 
People for the American Way, he has played 
a pivotal role in the defense of free speech, 
the right to vote and the guardrails between 
church and state. In doing so, he has pushed 
our nation to live up to our founding values of 
truth, freedom and justice—and advancing a 
future where all children can live free from 
barriers to achieving their fullest-potential. 
Indeed, his cultural creations and deter-
mined activism have earned the admiration of 
many Members of Congress and countless 
Americans across the country. His outstanding 
career has paved the way for generations of 
artists to follow in his footsteps, continuing his 
legacy of pushing the boundaries of cultural 
conversations and fighting for progressive 
change. 
On behalf of his many friends in Congress, 
we join in celebrating this momentous mile-
stone in Norman’s extraordinary life. We wish 
him, his dear wife Lyn, his beloved children 
Kate, Benjamin, Maggie, Brianna, Madeline 
and Ellen, and the entire Lear family all the 
best as they celebrate this joyous occasion.

JOSEPH (BUDDY) MATISE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to honor the many accomplishments of Jo-
seph ‘‘Buddy’’ Matise, a lifelong Hammonton, 
South Jersey resident. Buddy married his wife, 
Josephine, over 60 years ago and raised 2 
children with her in South Jersey. In addition 
to being a family man, he is a World War II 
Navy veteran. Buddy fought in the Pacific The-
ater on the USS Norman Scott from 1943 to 
1945 and fought for his country in many World 
War II battles. Buddy should be proud of his 
brave service to our great nation, and it is an 
honor to be able to recognize him for his sac-
rifices and courage. God Bless Buddy, and 
God Bless our United States of America. 
HONORING ASSEMBLYMEMBER 
MARK STONE 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
recognize 
California’s 
29th 
District 
Assemblymember Mark Stone as a long- 
standing champion of the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. 
Assemblymember Stone’s efforts to combat 
social injustices dates back to his time as a 
Santa Cruz Country Supervisor. As a two-term 
Supervisor, he overhauled the county’s child 
welfare system. The improved system in-
creased family and community support for fos-
ter youth and provided more integrated care, 
including 
culturally 
competent 
care 
for 
LGBTQ+ youth. Engaging with stakeholders 
around this issue led to a long-standing part-
nership with the Queer Youth Task Force of 
Santa Cruz County. Additionally, he supported 
funding the Queer and Trans Youth Council of 
Santa Cruz County and has been a speaker at 
multiple LGBTQ+ youth-led events, where he 
encourages future leaders to create commu-
nities that celebrate diversity and pride. 
Since his election to the California State As-
sembly in 2012, Assemblymember Stone’s 
mission has remained consistent. During his 
tenure, he has authored successful legislation 
that prohibits dismissing prospective jurors 
based on gender identity and expression and 
removed gender terms from the Fair Employ-
ment and Housing Act, effectively ensuring 
that transgender, non-binary, and gender non-
conforming people are offered equal protec-
tion. Notably, Assembly member Stone co-au-
thored legislation to add a non-binary gender 
marker on California birth certificates, drivers’ 
licenses, and identity cards, as well as a bill 
to protect incarcerated transgender people. 
Assemblymember Stone’s efforts in advanc-
ing the rights and protections of all Califor-
nians have earned him consistent recognition 
by Equality California, Planned Parenthood, 
ACLU, and the Courage Campaign, just to 
name a few. Taking full advantage of his time 
in office, Assemblymember Stone has honored 
outstanding members of the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity in state commemorations, including Dayna 
Sinopoli, a transgender woman, as the As-
sembly’s Women of the Year for the 29th Dis-
trict and Dr. Jen Hastings, the Assembly’s first 
non-binary Person of the Year. Additionally, 
Assemblymember Stone proudly named Dr. 
Chris DiMaio, co-founder of the Rainbow Vet-
erans of Santa Cruz County, as his 2015 Vet-
eran of the Year. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my sincere con-
gratulations to Assemblymember Mark Stone 
on being commemorated by Santa Cruz Coun-
ty’s 47th Annual Pride Festival. We are all so 
grateful for his leadership and his advocacy.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PELL GRANT 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Nelson Mandela imparted a lesson 
to all of us when he said: ‘‘Education is the 
most powerful weapon we can use to change 
the world.’’ This summer, we mark the 50th 
anniversary of the Pell Grant—a program that 
put postsecondary education in reach for tens 
of millions of low-income students, a program 
that gives access to the pursuit of knowledge 
for those not born into privilege, and a pro-
gram that allows students to change the world 
regardless of how much change is in their 
pockets. 
It is an honor and privilege to recognize the 
50th Anniversary of the Pell Grant Program. 
There was no Pell Grant when l went to col-
lege. The only way I could attend college was 
by the grace of receiving an academic schol-
arship that another student turned down. In 
1972, Congress recognized the challenges 
faced by students like me, and it amended the 
Higher Education Act to provide direct finan-
cial aid to low-income students to afford them 
the same access to higher education and op-
portunity for success as their higher-income 
peers. Originally called the Basic Educational 
Opportunity Grant, this program was later 
named the Pell Grant in honor of its original 
sponsor, Senator Claiborne Pell, a Democrat 
from Rhode Island. Signed into law by Presi-
dent Richard Nixon, the program has main-
tained bipartisan support for five decades. 
Since its creation, the Pell Grant has helped 
more than 80 million students attend college. 
Currently, 40 percent of undergraduate stu-
dents—nearly 7 million students—receive Pell 
Grants. In Illinois’s 7th Congressional District, 
nearly 33,000 students use over 142 million 
dollars in Pell Grants to pursue their higher 
education goals. The Pell Grant is undoubt-
edly the bedrock of federal financial aid for 
students. It is especially critical for students of 
color, with nearly 60 percent of Black stu-
dents, half of American Indian or Alaska Na-
tive students, and nearly half of Latinx stu-
dents receiving a Pell Grant each year. With-
out this pivotal program, many students—es-
pecially Black students—would be excluded 
from higher education altogether or have to 
dig themselves deeper into debt or struggle so 
much harder by working multiple jobs while at-
tending college. 
I am especially proud that, as we mark the 
50th anniversary, Congress has restored the 
Pell Grant to the incarcerated, a policy for 
which I fought for decades via the REAL Act. 
Just this week, the Department of Education 
issued its proposed rule to restore Pell so that 
incarcerated individuals can complete higher 
education coursework that improves their re-
entry, strengthens their economic well-being 
and that of their families, increases labor force 
participation, and grows our economy. 
The Pell grant has undeniable positive im-
pacts on students across the United States, 
that much is certain. As policymakers, it is our 
responsibility to ensure that the future of to-
morrow—our youth—are not hindered by the 
monetary challenges of today. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in fighting to substantially 
increase funding of this life-changing program 
so that it can make college affordable in the 
face of rising higher-education costs as it was 
intended.

HONORING COMMAND SERGEANT 
MAJOR GRETCHEN EVANS 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize a courageous veteran, a re-
silient leader, and a selfless Mainer. Com-
mand Sergeant Major Gretchen Evans of 
Brunswick, Maine is one of the most deco-
rated female veterans in American history 
serving in the United States Army for 27 
years. Since enlisting at age 19, CMS Evans 
has served in tours of Kosovo, Bosnia, Soma-
lia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, where she respon-
sible for more than 30,000 ground troops. Ms. 
Evans’ honorable dedication to defending our 
country earned her the position of Command 
Sergeant Major, the highest non-commis-
sioned officer rank in the military. 
In 2006, Command Sergeant Major Evans 
survived a barrage of mortar fire in Afghani-
stan which rendered her deaf and wounded. 
After her combat injury, she quickly found re-
newed vitality by learning to lip read, forging 
relationships with her ‘‘hearing dogs,’’ Aura 
and Rusty, and by proactively reaching out to 
fellow veterans with similar lived experience. 
Today, in Maine, CMS Evans continues to 
give back as an active fundraiser and ambas-
sador for local nonprofits which provide sup-
port services to disabled veterans and which 
seek to prevent veteran-experienced social 
isolation and depression. Additionally, CMS 
Evans is a distinguished public speaker who 
advocates for the importance of leadership, 
perseverance, and teamwork, as a part of 
‘‘Women Veterans Speak,’’ a national speak-
er’s bureau. 
When she is not inspiring others to serve, 
CMS Evans pursues her passion for extreme 
sports, running 40 marathons. CMS Evans 
also led UNBROKEN, the first all-mixed abili-
ties team to complete in ‘‘The World’s Tough-
est Race,’’ a 670-kilometer, week-long endur-
ance race held in Fiji. This achievement re-
cently earned her the Pat Tillman Award for 
Service at the 2022 ESPYs, which honors in-
dividuals with both strong connections to 
sports and community leadership. This fall, 
CMS Evans will also be inducted into the U.S. 
Veteran’s Hall of Fame in recognition for her 
outstanding meritorious service to our country. 
I thank Command Sergeant Major Gretchen 
Evans, for her selfless acts of duty to keep 
this Nation safe. The people of Maine are in-
credibly lucky to have her as an advocate, a 
leader, and a community member. I wish CMS 
Evans the very best and I look forward to see-
ing her continue to thrive.

HARRIET TUBMAN BICENTENNIAL 
COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, today I rise in 
support of H.R. 1842, Harriet Tubman Bicen-
tennial Commemorative Coin Act, which I in-
troduced with Congressman KATKO. 
This legislation honors Harriet Tubman by 
requiring the Department of Treasury to mint 
and issue coins bearing her likeness. We can 
all agree she is an icon for the constant push 
for more freedom and equality in this country. 
Tubman was born into slavery and escaped 
after surviving many years of brutality under 
the institution of chattel slavery. She dedicated 
her life to fighting against the oppression of 
white supremacy, for the freedom and rights of 
African Americans and women’s suffrage. 
In today’s world where we are continuing to 
fight for justice and equality for all, we should 
all learn from Tubman’s historic contributions 
and sacrifices. 
I want to thank the Harriet Tubman Home in 
Auburn, New York which was founded by Tub-
man herself, and the National Underground 
Railroad Freedom Center in Ohio, for working 
with me and Congressman KATKO on this bill. 
I urge all Members to vote for this bill and 
help these organizations who are doing in-
credible work to promote Harriet Tubman’s 
core values and inspire Americans with her 
story.

RYAN CYBULSKI 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of attending Ryan 
Cybulski’s (Si-bull-ski) Eagle Scout Court of 
Honor. In September of 2010, Ryan joined 
Mantua Pack 45 Cub Scouts and worked his 
way up the ranks to eventually earn the rank 
of Eagle Scout. For his Eagle Scout project, 
Ryan approached the Mantua Township Fire 
Chief and formulated a plan to build a hose 
bed training aid for the fire station. His project 
benefits the fire department by allowing the 
firefighters to practice using a fire hose without 
having to take the hose off one of the fire 
trucks. Ryan should be proud of his contribu-
tion to the Mantua Township Fire Department, 
and it was my honor to attend his Eagle Scout 
ceremony. God Bless Ryan, and God Bless 
our United States of America.

HONORING JUAN MARTINEZ 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Juan Martinez, a local 
hero, an influential Chicano activist, and in-
valuable community archivist. After a year-long 
battle with cancer, Mr. Martinez passed away, 
and leaves behind a legacy of storytelling. 
The son of a World War II veteran, Juan 
Martinez was born and raised in the City of 
Gonzalez. Be attended Gonzalez High School, 
where he played football and became active in 
the Farmworkers’ Movement. 
As an 18-year-old high school student, Mr. 
Martinez stood with United Farm Workers and 
Cesar Chavez when he spent 20 days in jail 
in Salinas in 1970 for refusing to call off a let-
tuce boycott. Mr. Martinez was among some 
2,000 supporters who marched with Chavez to 
turn himself in at the jail, and Juan Martinez 
joined the group as a bodyguard to protect Mr. 
Chavez. This experience fueled Mr. Martinez’s 
passion to support the Farmworkers’ Move-
ment and marginalized communities. 
He later became a champion of the preser-
vation of the Farmworkers’ Movement and its 
history in Salinas and on the central coast of 
California. He fought tirelessly to transform the 
old Monterey County into a Cesar Chavez Mu-
seum and was instrumental in having it des-
ignated on the National Register of Historic 
Places. He also kept a personal collection of 
photographs, testimonies and artifacts related 
to the movement, ensuring that this important 
part of our history is never lost. He also orga-
nized the installation of signage on Highway 
101, designating part of it as ‘‘Bracero Memo-
rial Highway’’ to honor 32 seasonal farm-
workers who died in a truck crash in Chualar 
in 1963. 
Additionally, he served the Central Coast as 
a community worker with California Rural 
Legal Assistance, assisting historically dis-
advantaged communities. Mr. Martinez also 
served on the Hartnell College Board of Trust-
ees from 1979 to 1991 and was a co-founder 
of the Monterey County Pesticide Coalition. 
The coalition fought to establish the first field 
posting ordinance in Monterey County in 1983 
that would become a model for statewide leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, Juan Martinez’s commit-
ment to service will continue to protect and im-
pact Californians for generations to come. Let 
us always remember his legacy of service and 
honor his commitment to the Central Coast 
and its storied history.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
MICHAEL J. HORNYAK 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. RENSCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the life of Michael J. 
Hornyak of Homestead, Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Hornyak was a man devoted to his faith, 
family, and country. When the North Korean 
People’s Army stormed across the 38th par-
allel, Mr. Hornyak answered the call of duty. 
His patriotism and bravery as a Sergeant in 
the Air Force while defending freedom-loving 
people a world away demonstrated his im-
mense character; 
Beyond his service to our country, Mr. 
Hornyak was active in his community. He was 
a longtime member of the Homestead United 
Presbyterian Church and was known as a tal-
ented carpenter, woodworker, and bricklayer, 
Mr. Hornyak was devoted to his family, includ-
ing his children Michael Hornyak, Janie 
Hochlinski, and the late Judith Hutchinson, as 
well as his grandchildren Michael-Eric, Mat-
thew, Molli, and Addi. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the life and legacy of Michael J. 
Hornyak. May we be inspired by his patriotism 
and devotion to his family.

INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE RESO-
LUTION TO RECOGNIZE CHICANO 
HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to proudly introduce legislation to recognize 
Chicano Heritage Month. 
The Mexican American community has re-
claimed ‘‘Chicano’’ to empower and uplift the 
Mexican-American identity. 
The Chicanos of my district, the State of 
California, and America as a whole, have sig-
nificantly contributed to the advancement of 
our country. Chicanos have aided in scientific 
advancement, such as the invention of the X- 
ray reflection microscope in 1948. Chicanos 
have made major strides in the category of 
space exploration, as Ellen Ochoa was the 
first Hispanic female astronaut. As of 2019, 
approximately 37,000,000 Chicano immigrants 
reside in the United States and make up about 
61.4 percent of America’s Latino population. 
In my district, Chicanos make up an over-
whelming majority of the city of Santa Ana, 
which became the first major city last year to 
recognize Augustas Chicano Heritage Month. 
Mexican Americans in the United States de-
serve recognition for their aforementioned 
achievements and contributions to our country. 
Therefore, I am introducing the Chicano Month 
Resolution. This resolution will recognize Au-
gust as Chicano Heritage Month and acknowl-
edge the enhancement of diversity that the 
Chicano population provides for the United 
States.

AMERICAN TYPE CULTURE 
COLLECTION (ATCC) 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the American Type Culture Col-
lection (ATCC) located in Manassas, Virginia, 
which has provided biological research re-
sources for decades. Over the past two years, 
ATCC played a critical role in responding to 
the COVID–19 pandemic by supporting the re-
search community within the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), the Department of Defense (DoD), and 
other partners. 
Founded in 1925, ATCC is a diverse biologi-
cal resource center, focusing on advancing 
global health initiatives within the U.S. govern-
ment, academia, and research foundations. 
ATCC has assisted the government for over 
50 years with research and development, in-
novative solutions, and biological products. 
During several recent pandemics, including 
COVID–19, SARS, Zika, and H1N1 influenza, 
ATCC was a provider of R&D services, re-
agents, detection and surveillance assays, and 
logistical support for the federal and global re-
sponse. ATCC ensured the research commu-
nity could conduct research, gather data, 
share insights, and advance critical counter-
measures. 
ATCC manages the Biodefense and Emerg-
ing Infections Resources (BEI Resources) Pro-
gram for NIAID, which has received more than 
140 variants of SARS–CoV–2 and propagated 
the virus to enable and support diagnostic, 
vaccine, and therapeutic development. BEI 
Resources has provided more than 105,000 
vials of SARS–CoV–2 and related coronavirus 
strains and reagents to over 3,600 research-
ers at 1,700 institutions in more than 70 coun-
tries since 2020. BEI Resources continues to 
play a critical role in cross-agency initiatives to 
harmonize research methodologies, assess 
the impact of emerging variants, and evaluate 
new and existing countermeasures. 
ATCC offers researchers a range of tools 
and resources to contain the impact and in-
vestigate the long-lasting effects of COVID– 
19, including monoclonal antibodies against 
the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain 
of SARS–CoV–2, microbial strains for cross- 
reactivity testing, cell lines for vaccine devel-
opment and immune research, and heat-inac-
tivated material for use in molecular assays. 
ATCC has also worked to advance molecular 
diagnostic testing and has provided the nec-
essary array of clinically relevant materials for 
evaluating the limit of detection, inclusivity, 
and cross-reactivity of the virus. 
As a non-profit, ATCC collaborates with 
many areas of the federal government includ-
ing, the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS), the CDC, the National Cancer 
Institute, the DoD, the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture (USDA), the Biomedical Advanced 
Research 
and 
Development 
Authority 
(BARDA) and the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) to strengthen and improve public 
health initiatives. 
Whether the challenge is COVID–19 or an-
other infectious disease, ATCC has enabled 
the research community by providing high- 
quality, industry-standard biological materials 
and services.

my July Constituent of the Month. The over-
turning of Roe v. Wade upended nearly 50 
years of women’s reproductive rights. As we 
enter a future without Roe, California is con-
tinuing to lead the way to protect the right to 
seek an abortion and Dr. Gupta is at the fore-
front of these efforts in Southern California. 
Dr. Pratima Gupta is a board-certified OB/ 
GYN and professor working at UC San Diego 
Health. She also provides abortion care at the 
Planned Parenthood of Orange and San 
Bernardino Counties and the Planned Parent-
hood of the Pacific Southwest. She is a long- 
time advocate for access to reproductive care 
and has worked to amplify the voices of physi-
cians to advance reproductive rights and care 
in the United States. 
Earlier this month, I invited Dr. Gupta onto 
my podcast, Listening with Levin, to discuss 
the ruling and our path forward. I am incred-
ibly grateful for constituents like Dr. Gupta 
who continue to provide essential reproductive 
healthcare services in the aftermath of the 
overturning of Roe v. Wade. Our community is 
healthier and safer because of Dr. Gupta’s 
dedication to her patients and to protecting 
women’s reproductive rights. I thank her from 
the bottom of my heart for her courage, com-
passion, and commitment to supporting our 
community, and I’m honored to recognize her 
as my July Constituent of the Month.

REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE 
ROBERT C. ‘‘BUD’’ MCFARLANE 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and work of The Honor-
able Robert C. ‘‘Bud’’ McFarlane, who passed 
away on May 12, 2022. 
An Eagle Scout and son of William McFar-
lane, former Congressman from the Thirteenth 
Congressional District of Texas, Bud McFar-
lane’s public service encompassed ten years 
in the White House and State Department in 
posts including service as Military Assistant to 
National Security Advisors Henry Kissinger 
and Brent Scowcroft, Counselor to the Depart-
ment of State, the President’s Special Rep-
resentative in the Middle East, and President 
Reagan’s National Security Advisor. 
After his graduation from the United States 
Naval Academy in 1959, Bud was commis-
sioned as a second lieutenant in the United 
States Marine Corps—the first step in what 
would become nearly 60 years of dedicated 
service to his country. A model Marine, Bud 
served as a Platoon Commnnder—155mm 
Howitzer and Heavy Artillery Rocket (Honest 
John) Batteries, Gunnery Instructor (awarded 
the Army Commendation Medal) and the 3rd 
Marine Division’s Battery Commander, com-
manding the artillery battery in the first landing 
of U.S. forces in Vietnam. 
After being nominated for the Legion of 
Merit and receiving the Bronze Star and Navy 
Commendation Medal, both with Valor device, 
Bud assumed the Executive Assistant and 
Aide to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and 
Programs position at Headquarters, U.S. Ma-
rine Corps in Washington, D.C. During this 
time, he prepared the Deputy and Com-
mandant for meetings with the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff and served as the Marine Corps Action 
Officer for Europe/NATO, the Middle East, and 
Latin America. In 1971, Bud was selected as 
a White House Fellow, serving as Executive 
Assistant to the Counselor to the President for 
Congressional Relations. In this role, he pre-
pared and carried out highly sensitive intel-
ligence work as Military Assistant to Dr, Henry 
Kissinger. 
Promoted early to Lieutenant Colonel, Bud 
was subsequently selected to attend the Na-
tional War College in 1978, co-authored the 
book ‘‘Crisis Resolution,’’ and one year later 
won The Alfred Thayer Mahan Award for Lit-
erary Achievement. Upon retirement from the 
Marine Corps in 1979, Bud went to work in the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, aiding in 
the consideration of the SALT II Treaty. In 
1981, he managed sensitive exchanges be-
tween Secretary of State Alexander Haig and 
Heads of State and Government in the Middle 
East and South Asia as Counselor of the De-
partment of State. 
The next year, Bud was appointed to serve 
as the Deputy Assistant to the President for 
National Security Affairs at the White House 
and led the integration of the policy rec-
ommendations for the Departments of State, 
Treasury, and Defense. Serving as the Presi-
dent’s Special Representative to the Middle 
East in 1983, he was responsib1e for sensitive 
negotiations between Israel and neighboring 
Arab states. Following this assignment, Bud 
was named Assistant to the President for Na-
tional Security Affairs. This position proved to 
be a defining moment in a career devoted to 
serving the public interest. Bud utilized this 
role to function as the architect of policies that 
stressed the Soviet economy and drove it to-
wards its collapse and failure of Marxism in 
the former Soviet Union. After the fall of the 
USSR, Bud continued his work in achieving 
the first reduction of nuclear weapons in his-
tory. 
After the end of the Cold War, Bud em-
barked on a distinguished career in the private 
sector, assuming the position of Counselor at 
the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in 1986. Concurrently, he established 
the international consulting firm McFarlane 
and Associates. Three years later, Bud found-
ed Global Energy Investors, sponsoring major 
international power projects. 
In the mid-2000s, he became Chairman of 
Energy and Communication Solutions, leading 
the firm in organizing, financing, building, and 
operating 
successful 
global 
infrastructure 
projects with a geographic focus on the former 
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Turkey, and 
other emerging markets. After more than 25 
years of specialized energy experience, Bud 
co-founded the bipartisan U.S. Energy Secu-
rity Council in 2012, collaborating with former 
Cabinet Officers, Fortune 500 Corporate 
CEOs, and senior retired military officers to 
focus on forging a more coherent national en-
ergy policy for the U.S. 
The tremendous respect Bud commanded 
around the world is reflected by the many ac-
colades he has received throughout his ex-
traordinary career, as well as the significant 
leadership positions he has held. Bud served 
as the Institute for the Analysis of Global Se-
curity’s President, Senior Advisor for the Foun-
dation for Defense of Democracies and Direc-
tor of the Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy, The France Fund (Dillon, Read Coun-
try Fund), The Travelers (since merged to 
form Citibank), and Church & Dwight. He was 
awarded the Secretary of State’s Distin-
guished Service Award, the Secretary of the 
Navy’s Medal for Distinguished Public Service, 
the Distinguished Service Medal, and The 
American-Swiss Friendship Man of the Year 
Award. 
Bud is survived by his wife of 63 years, 
Jonda Riley McFarlane, and the families of 
their 3 children: Lauren (Steve; Maggie, Tom); 
Scott (Malinda; Cara, Pierce, Elliott, Aidan); 
and Melissa (John; Tulley, Piper). 
We remember Bud’s warmth, wisdom, and 
deep belief in God as well as his unwavering 
commitment to serving others.

NATO REINFORCED FOR 
DEMOCRACY 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, 
last 
week, 
Congressman 
BILL 
KEATING offered an historic resolution express-
ing support for Finland and Sweden to join the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
I was particularly grateful to support the res-
olution having just returned from a Congres-
sional Delegation of the Organization for Se-
curity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to 
Helsinki, Finland, and Stockholm, Sweden. 
Led by Helsinki Commission Ranking Mem-
ber Senator ROGER WICKER of Mississippi and 
Co-Chairman Representative STEVE COHEN of 
Tennessee, the U.S. delegation was grateful 
to meet with President Sauli Niinisto¨ of Fin-
land, OSCE Parliamentary Assembly Vice 
President and Special Representative Pia 
Kauma of Finland, Foreign Minister Ann Linde 
of Sweden, OSCE Parliamentarv Assembly 
President Margareta Cederfelt, and Speaker of 
the Swedish Parliament Andreas Norle´n, 
NATO is more important than ever with war 
criminal Putin’s mass murder in Ukraine, sacri-
ficing young Russians for his personal gain of 
oil, money, and power. Tragically, many of us 
never imagined the insanity of a 21st Century 
land war in Europe. 
Both Finland and Sweden enhance the 
peacekeeping ability of NATO with their pro-
fessional militaries and extraordinary defense

TRIBUTE TO REV. MCKINLEY 
WASHINGTON, JR. 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dear friend, whose life 
was a testament to the biblical admonition 
‘‘faith without works is dead.’’ Reverend 
McKinley Washington, Jr. spent his career in 
the pulpit while serving a quarter of a century 
in the South Carolina legislature. His passing 
on July 24, 2022, has silenced a beloved faith 
and community leader along the Sea Islands 
of South Carolina. 
McKinley was one of eight children born to 
the late McKinley Washington, Sr. and Mattie 
Peterson Washington in the Stackhouse com-
munity of Sumter County, South Carolina. He 
graduated from Goodwill Parochial School, the 
same institution that educated Mary McLeod 
Bethune. He subsequently attended Johnson 
C. Smith, a historically Black college, in Char-
lotte, North Carolina. There, he joined the Stu-
dent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, 
helped organize civil rights marches, and was 
arrested for his activism. McKinley also made 
time for his studies and earned a B.A. in 1961 
and a master’s degree in divinity from John-
son C. Smith Theological Seminary in 1964. 
Although both of us were born and raised in 
Sumter County our paths did not cross until 
we arrived in Charleston County around the 
same time in the early 1960s. He had accept-
ed a call to pastor at Edisto Presbyterian 
Church and I had accepted a teaching position 
in the Charleston County public school sys-
tem. We both became actively engaged in 
local politics and it was not long before we 
and our wives became great friends. 
He was young, energetic, and determined to 
make a difference in his community and 
throughout the Sea Islands of Charleston 
County. In Charleston he rekindled his activ-
ism, establishing the Edisto Branch of the 
NAACP, helping to stand up the Franklin Fet-
ter federally qualified community health center, 
and later, the Sea Island Comprehensive 
Health Care Corp. 
When I left the classroom and became a 
Counselor with the Charleston County Em-
ployment Security Commission in 1965 and 
later Director of the Charleston County Neigh-
borhood Youth Corps and New Careers 
project, McKinley helped in my effort to get 
part time jobs for high school students and 
work experiences for high school dropouts. 
Our signature effort came through the creation 
of a Talent Search project that sent hundreds 
of low-income high school graduates to col-
leges and universities across the country. 
Most of those students went to Wilberforce 
University in Ohio. Among them were Larry 
Whaley pastor of St. Paul Baptist Church and 
the Rev. Nelson Rivers, pastor of Calvary 
Baptist Church and Vice President of National 
Action Network who is a dynamic faith leader 
in his own right. 
It was during this time that McKinley be-
came an active board member of the South 
Carolina Commission for Farm Workers, an 
agency created to aid migrants and seasonal 
farm workers. After some fits and starts, that 
Commission hired me to be their Executive Di-
rector in 1968. 
McKinley and I bonded, and he became my 
go-to guy. We worked together to develop an 
adult education project, a Self-Help housing 
program, and he helped me form a rural 
version of the Talent Search concept to pro-
vide opportunities to the children of migrants 
and seasonal farm workers. 
After working in the trenches to improve the 
quality of life for his community, McKinley de-
cided he could better serve his community by 
running for public office. Although he lost his 
first campaign for the State House of Rep-
resentatives, he ran again during a special 
election and won; He went on to represent 
District 116 in the House from 1975 to 1989, 
and then served in the State Senate rep-
resenting District 45 from 1990 to 2000. He 
continued his public service after 25 years in 
the State legislature by serving an additional 
eight years on the S.C. Employment Security 
Commission. 
His career in public service was marked by 
his dedication to issues of equity and justice. 
McKinley was always focused on providing for, 
‘‘the least of these,’’ and communities that 
have been historically neglected. To honor his 
service, the modern bridge that connects Ed-
isto Island to the mainland is named in his 
honor. It is a fitting tribute to the man who 
spent his life building bridges and solving 
problems. 
Throughout his public service and commu-
nity work, McKinley served 50 years as pastor 
of Edisto Presbyterian Church until his retire-
ment in 2012. His faith informed his service 
and was at the core of who he was as leader. 
McKinley met Beulah Jeffries, the love of his 
life while at Johnson C. Smith, and the two 
became the proud parents of Michael and 
Katrina, and grandparents of two grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the life and 
legacy of McKinley Washington, Jr. May we all 
learn from the example of this outstanding 
South Carolinian, born during the Jim Crow 
era in the ghettoized Stackhouse Place com-
munity of Sumter County, South Carolina who 
went on to live a transformational life. It has 
been one of my life’s blessed experiences to 
call him a dear friend.

NICHOLAS LUCIANO 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of attending Nicholas 
Luciano’s (Lu-see-ah-no) Eagle Scout Court of 
Honor. Nicholas achieved the Eagle Scout 
rank as a part of Troop 26. Throughout his 
scouting career, he earned 21 Merit Badges 
and served his troop in a variety of leadership 
roles. For his Eagle Scout project, Nicholas 
built and rehabilitated planters at the Estell 
Manor Park in Atlantic County, which is home 
to a large diversity of plants and animals. This 
young man should be proud of his accom-
plishments, and it was my honor to have had 
the opportunity to recognize him for his serv-
ice to South Jersey. God Bless Nicholas, and 
God Bless our United States of America.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
MICHAEL GATES 
HON. MICHELLE STEEL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize one of my constituents, and a 
dedicated public servant, for his efforts to pro-
tect taxpayers and his commitment to our 
community. 
Since 2015, Michael Gates has served as 
the independently elected Huntington Beach 
City Attorney. He has been an effective advo-
cate for law enforcement and worked to keep 
the citizens of Huntington Beach safe by lead-
ing the charge to fight local crime. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, as Gov-
ernor Newsom enacted unilateral and draco-
nian restrictions, Mr. Gates worked to pre-
serve local control of our world-class beaches. 
He has upheld the rule of law, pushing back 
against the ‘‘sanctuary state’’ law that has 
made California especially vulnerable to the 
ongoing border crisis. 
In all these ways and more, Michael Gates 
has proved to be a hardworking and effective 
advocate for the people of Huntington Beach, 
and for that, I thank him for his service to our 
community.

TRIBUTE TO CHIEF SERGEANT 
IVAN M. RUIZ 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, today I 
recognize a lifetime of service and the retire-
ment of Chief Master Sergeant Ivan Miguel 
Ruiz, a native of the great State of Texas. 
After 26 years of service as an Air Force 
Pararescueman, CMSgt Ruiz is relinquishing 
the responsibilities as Chief Enlisted Manager 
58th Rescue Squadron, 563rd Operations 
Group, 355th Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan Air 
Force Base, Arizona. The Air Force has con-
sistently relied upon Ivan’s exceptional leader-
ship and unparalleled work ethic. He has led 
our Nation’s men and women both overseas 
and at home, leading numerous joint combat 
rescue and humanitarian operations around 
the world. Ivan has excelled in numerous 
other leadership positions in the Air Force, as 
well as becoming a physical fitness legend in 
the Special Warfare Community. 
The Pararescue Creed is ‘‘It is my duty as 
a Pararescueman to save life and aid the in-
jured. I will be prepared at all times to perform 
my assigned duties quickly and efficiently, 
placingthese duties before personal desires 
and comforts. These things I’do, that others 
may live.’’ Ivan committed these words to 
every aspect of his career and especially dis-
played them during a nighttime operation in 
Afghanistan on December 10, 2013. During a 
raid in Kandahar Province, Sergeant Ruiz en-
gaged and neutralized four insurgents, becom-
ing isolated from his element. Sergeant Ruiz 
and two teammates quickly encountered insur-
gent crossfire. Sergeant Ruiz eliminated one 
enemy fighting position; however, enemy fire 
wounded his two comrades, rendering them 
immobile and exposed to the enemy. Sergeant 
Ruiz courageously pressed ahead through in-
tense small arms fire and grenades to reach 
his 
wounded 
comrades. 
He 
successfully 
brought them back to a covered position, 
where he administered life-saving trauma care 
to his teammates. The heroic actions of Ser-
geant Ruiz saved the lives of two teammates 
and contributed to the elimination of eleven in-
surgents. Through his extraordinary heroism, 
and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, 
this native Texan was awarded the Air Force 
Cross, the United States Air Force’s second 
highest military decoration for Airmen who dis-
tinguish themselves with extraordinary heroism 
in combat with an armed enemy force. 
On November 1st of this year, Ivan will re-
tire back to the great State of Texas. On be-
half of the entire Congress and a grateful Na-
tion, I express my sincere gratitude and appre-
ciation to Chief Master Sergeant Ruiz for his 
outstanding leadership and unwavering sup-
port for the missions of this nation. I would like 
to also recognize the dedicated service of 
Ivan’s family to our country. His mother, 
Josefina, a civil servant, his father, MSG Ruiz, 
USA, Ret., his siblings, SFC Aerial Ruiz, USA, 
Ret., MAJ Elizabeth Ruiz, USA, MAJ Ino Ruiz, 
USA, and Lt Jazmin Reed, USN, and SrA 
Charles White, USAF, all have served or are 
serving honorably. I would also like to recog-
nize his supportive and loving wife of 12 
years, Mrs. Maria Ruiz, and their children, 
Jason, Sofia, Elijah, and Elena. I wish the 
Ruiz family safe travels back to Texas, and I 
look forward to seeing Ivan continue to excel 
as he enters his next chapter.

NOAA CHIEF SCIENTIST ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 26, 2022 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my bill, H.R. 3952, the NOAA Chief 
Scientist Act. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration is the premier federal agency in 
oceanic and atmospheric research. From cli-
mate modeling to aquatic habitat preservation, 
NOAA conducts scientific research that im-
proves the lives of all Americans, especially in 
my home state of New Jersey. 
The agency’s Chief Scientist performs an in-
tegral and extensive role in facilitating the co-
ordination of research efforts across each of 
NOAA’s six unique line offices and with other 
federal agencies. Previous Chief Scientists 
come from decorated and distinguished back-
grounds, including scientists from preeminent 
roles 
in 
oceanography 
and 
atmospheric 
science. Dr. Sarah Kapnick, an executive with 
18 years of experience at the intersection of 
climate science and economics, has been 
most recently named to this role. 
The Chief Scientist also plays a critical role 
in ensuring that NOAA can accurately predict 
future weather events, an essential service to 
help Americans prepare for severe weather. In 
New Jersey, the forecast residents received in 
advance of Hurricane Ida did not adequately 
prepare them for the storm, which killed 25 
people across the state and cost the United 
States $65 billion. As weather events become 
more frequent and severe due to climate 
change, accurate weather forecasting from the 
agency will save lives and money. 
This bipartisan bill clarifies the role that the 
Chief Scientist has in advising NOAA on sci-
entific technology policies and strategies. The 
Chief Scientist’s role requires an established 
and experienced background in producing 
sound scientific work as well as respect from 
the scientific community to facilitate connec-
tions towards cutting edge research that does 
not merely reflect partisan interests. It is im-
portant that NOAA’s Chief Scientist is insu-
lated from political interference and maintain 
scientific integrity. That is why this bill requires 
the Chief Scientist to both adhere to, and up-
hold, scientific integrity policies. 
This bill directs the NOAA Administrator to 
give due consideration to recommendations 
that are submitted by reputable and diverse 
scientific and academic organizations within 
the U.S. This includes scientific organizations 
such as the National Academies and NOAA’s 
Science Advisory Board, which have extensive 
experience with scientists of this caliber. It 
also requires the Chief Scientist to be knowl-
edgeable in the scientific disciplines associ-
ated with the work at NOAA—a reasonable re-
quirement given the complexities of NOAA’s 
work. 
This bill further establishes an Office of the 
Chief Scientist, to be staffed by Federal em-
ployees of NOAA which will be detailed into 
the office on a rotating basis. Detailing em-
ployees from all line offices ensures that each 
will remain represented in overseeing the re-
search at NOAA. The new role of Deputy 
Chief Scientist, designated by the NOAA Ad-
ministrator, will further support the functions of 
the Chief Scientist, and will perform the role of 
Acting Chief Scientist in the event of a va-
cancy in the position. These steps will provide 
crucial support to the Chief Scientist to further 
the mission of NOAA. 
Finally, this bill requires that the Chief Sci-
entist produce a yearly, public report which 
describes the accomplishments and imple-
mentation of NOAA’s scientific and techno-
logical strategies. This report will also detail 
any challenges faced by the agency and pro-
vide a transparent summary of all research 
funded by NOAA. This will include a break-
down of the percentage of research funded 
and carried out by the private sector, coopera-
tive institutes, academia, nongovernmental or-
ganizations, and other institutions. This yearly 
report will further ensure that the research 
mission of NOAA is transparent and forward- 
thinking. 
I want to thank my colleague from the 
Science Committee, Representative FEENSTRA 
of Iowa, for working with me to introduce this 
bill. This bill has also been endorsed by the 
American Meteorological Society and the 
Union of Concerned Scientists. 
Scientific research is at its best when it is 
approached collaboratively and includes a va-
riety of perspectives and skillsets. This bill out-
lines the responsibilities and requirements for 
a NOAA Chief Scientist to ensure that a quali-
fied individual can help the agency advance its 
cross-cutting mission of science and service. 
This will support NOAA’s efforts to provide 
world-class research to serve communities 
through future research endeavors.

HONORING MR. ARTHUR HUGHES 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Arthur 
Hughes, a constituent of Georgia’s Thirteenth 
Congressional District, for his efforts to recog-
nize the fathers whose sons or daughters 
gave their lives in the line of duty. Mr. Hughes’ 
commitment to this goal led to the dedication 
of highway (State Route 139) as ‘‘Gold Star 
Fathers Highway’’. 
We know our Gold Star Families to be the 
relatives of American service members who 
made the ultimate sacrifice. The honor of a 
‘‘Gold Star’’ is given posthumously to honor 
the service member and uplift their family. 
Gold Star Fathers’ collective grief and an-
guish show that our service members do not 
go into the armed forces alone, but with the 
support of their loved ones. As a grateful na-
tion, it is imperative that we honor the Gold 
Star Fathers across the country who contrib-
uted so much to support our American heroes. 
Since 1936, our nation has set time aside 
each year to formally recognize and uplift Gold 
Star Mothers. However, we have not yet codi-
fied any observance to include Gold Star Fa-
thers in the same respect. It is to this end that 
Mr. Hughes seeks to shed light on the fathers 
of our fallen heroes. 
He is not the only Georgian who has under-
taken this pursuit. Georgia State Representa-
tive Rhonda Burnough has long made increas-
ing the recognition for Gold Star Fathers a 
cornerstone of her work in the state legisla-
ture. It was her diligence that led to for-
malizing the statewide recognition of Gold Star 
Fathers on the ninth of November each year. 
The unwavering commitment to our service 
members and their families that these stalwart 
citizens embody is a selfless form of diligence 
and service that we should seek to emulate as 
a nation. It is the bare minimum we can do for 
those who gave all in service to our great na-
tion. The efforts of these Georgians are com-
mendable to the highest degree. 
May God Bless our Armed Forces and may 
God Bless America.

COMMENDING JEFFREY F. 
WERLING 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the outstanding 
service of Jeffrey Werling, who is retiring this 
week after almost 40 years as a dedicated 
public servant, educator, and economist, the 
past six of them at the Congressional Budget 
Office. 
Jeff has served as the Director of CBO’s 
Macroeconomic Analysis Division since 2016. 
In that capacity, he has overseen the produc-
tion of the economic forecasts that underlie 
CBO’s budget projections, led the agency’s 
macroeconomic analyses of major legislation, 
and provided guidance to the Director and 
staff on economic issues under some of the 
most challenging circumstances that the agen-
cy has experienced. Jeff has been a leader in 
enhancing transparency in CBO’s economic 
analyses and promoting public understanding 
of the key economic issues facing the nation. 
Drawing on his diverse experience, deep un-
derstanding of economic relationships, and 
strong intuition, he helped make CBO’s anal-
yses clearer and more helpful to the Members 
of Congress and more accessible to the 
broader public. 
Jeff started his career in 1981 in the United 
States Peace Corps as a secondary education 
teacher in West Africa. After receiving his 
Ph.D. in economics from University of Mary-
land, he made many contributions to econom-
ics research and education as an analyst, 
teacher, and leader in private and public orga-
nizations in the United States and abroad. He 
came to CBO from Inforum, an economic re-
search organization, where he was the execu-
tive director, providing guidance on govern-
ment policy analysis and a variety of economic 
issues. 
In his leadership role at CBO, Jeff has been 
a constant source of support, encouragement, 
and constructive feedback to his colleagues. 
He has always been generous, especially to 
junior 
staff, 
with 
his 
time, 
ideas, 
and 
mentorship. His colleagues in CBO will miss 
his guidance, wisdom, keen sense of humor, 
and softball prowess. 
I know my colleagues join me in extending 
our thanks and appreciation to Jeff for his 
service to our country. We wish him well in his 
future undertakings and hope that the Nation 
will continue to benefit from his expertise and 
commitment.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of attending Jack 
Notarfrancesco’s 
(No-tar-fran-sis-co) 
Eagle 
Scout Court of Honor. Jack is a scout in Troop 
55 in Somers Point, South Jersey. For his 
Eagle Scout project, he built and constructed 
a chicken coop for the Funny Farm Animal 
Rescue in Mays Landing, South Jersey. This 
chicken coop will create a home for unwanted 
chickens, who may have otherwise been 
euthanized. Jack should be proud of his 
project and donation to the Funny Farm Ani-
mal Rescue, and it was my pleasure to attend 
his Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony. 
God Bless Jack, and God Bless our America.

HONORING ED CAVALLINI 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 27, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 99th birthday of 2nd Lieuten-
ant Ed Cavallini, who was born May 18, 1923, 
in San Francisco, California, and has dedi-
cated his life to serving our country and the 
central coast of California. 
While attending the University of Southern 
California, Mr. Cavallini enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps and married his wife 
Jeanne O’Donnell on October 14, 1944. Upon 
graduation, he was stationed at Marine Corps 
Base Camp Pendleton. At 19 years old, 2nd 
Lt. Cavallini boarded a ship bound to Iwo 
Jima, Japan as a Platoon Commander in the 
Fourth Marine Division. 
Under heavy Japanese bombardment and 
artillery fire, the 4th Division struggled to dig 
their foxholes in the fine, black volcanic sand, 
so 2nd Lt. Cavallini swiftly ordered his men 
into craters left by the enemy mortars. The 
Marines were pinned down for two days as 
their Commander leapt between craters and 
made note of where his 45 troops were with 
his black spiral notebook and Scripto mechan-
ical pencil, which he still has to this day. On 
the second day of battle, Lt. Cavallini was 
struck by a three-millimeter fragment of mor-
tar, which lodged into his heart muscle. Luck-
ily, the fragment hit his dog tags, saving his 
life. Shortly after his brush with death, he was 
struck by more shrapnel, this time hitting his 
knee, and ending his deployment to Iwo Jima 
after 34 days of combat. It was only two days 
after he left that the Marines raised the Amer-
ican Flag over Mount Suribachi. 2nd Lt. 
Cavallini was awarded the Purple Heart for his 
sacrifice that resulted in a crucial victory for 
the United States. 
Four months later, 2nd Lt. Cavallini was 
back training in Maui, Hawaii when the sirens 
rang and signaled the end of the war. 2nd Lt. 
Cavallini returned home to his bride, Jeanne, 
and they moved to Southern California. By 
1952 they had a family of four—John, Paul, 
Marc, and Jane. After careers with Firestone 
Engineering Laboratory and Lockheed-Martin, 
he began working for the Santa Clara County

Library System and was head librarian in 
Milpitas for many years. After the 1989 Loma 
Prieta Earthquake, the Cavallinis relocated to 
the Monterey Peninsula. After a brief stint with 
retirement, Ed Cavallini returned to serving his 
community by working with the Gilroy Public 
Library. Additionally, he was an original board 
member of the Monterey Jazz Festival, which 
is the longest running jazz festival in the 
world. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Ed Cavallini is the 
dedicated community member and leader we 
should all strive to be. I extend my personal 
gratitude for his service and sacrifice. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today on his 99th birthday.
