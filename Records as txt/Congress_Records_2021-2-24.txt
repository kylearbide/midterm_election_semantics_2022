WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2021 
No. 35 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
February 24, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable JIM COSTA 
to act as Speaker pro tempore on this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

GREEN ENERGY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
the Nation watched in horror at the 
terrible situation in Texas this last 
week with horrific weather conditions 
and then the aftermath dealing with 
problems with safe drinking water and 
supply. It was leavened a little bit by 
the plight of TED CRUZ who is notori-
ously struggling to tell the truth this 
time as he fled his State and leaving 
his 
constituents 
behind 
and 
then 
watching him contort trying to change 
his story over the course of the next 
few days. It was sort of a national joke. 
But what was happening in Texas was 
not a joke. These conditions were un-
precedented. But they found Texas un-
able to really respond in a way despite 
the fact that 10 years ago there was a 
similar situation. It is fascinating. TED 
CRUZ isn’t the only one struggling with 
the truth. The Governor of Texas, Gov-
ernor Abbott, sought to blame wind en-
ergy for their plight. Wind energy, 
which supplies less than 10 percent of 
the total energy supply for the State, 
performed better than fossil fuel which 
provided the majority of it. 
Think for a moment how they at-
tempted to target the Green New Deal 
and AOC. While TED CRUZ was strug-
gling to get his story straight, our col-
league, 
ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ, 
was raising millions of dollars to help 
people in Texas cope. Blaming a Green 
New Deal which has never actually 
been enacted—it is an aspirational 
goal—is foolish. What we have seen in 
Texas with those extreme weather 
events are a preview of coming attrac-
tions. 
What we saw in Australia this last 
year and in the Western United States 
with horrific wildfires, looking at a 
once-in-a-century weather event is be-
coming routine, and it is going to hap-
pen more and more frequently. 
I would suggest that Texas leadership 
could take a look at what they have 
done. Their famously deregulated en-
ergy system has given the family with 
a $16,000 electric bill or former Gov-
ernor and Energy Secretary Rick Perry 
said: Well, people would just be happy 
to have a few days without energy to 
be free of the dangers of Federal regu-
lation. 
I think people in the surrounding 
States that survived much better and 
didn’t have $16,000 monthly electric 
bills might review that. I would sug-
gest that the folks in Texas leadership 
could start first of all by telling the 
truth. It is not renewable energy, it 
was fossil fuel that failed and contin-
ued reliance on fossil fuel is going to 
make events like this much, much 
more frequent. 
We need to deal with reliability in 
Texas and around the country. Last, 
but not least, we must fight for climate 
justice and a low carbon future. That 
will help make these situations less 
frequent and more bearable, and it is a 
path forward that we can take con-
fident that history will reflect we were 
on the right side. 
f 
BIDEN COVID BAILOUT PACKAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, over the 
past year, the government has appro-
priated over $4 trillion—that is with a 
T—in COVID relief. Now we are stand-
ing here this week and we are debating 
whether or not to add another $2 tril-
lion to that enormous total. 
But what should shock taxpayers 
across the country is that $1 trillion of 
COVID relief still remains unspent. 
That means funding is still left over 
from last December and funding is still 
left over from even last March. Now, 
that is money that the current admin-
istration hasn’t spent for vaccines, 
hasn’t spent for testing, hasn’t spent 
on schools reopening, and certainly not 
even to reopen our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I think people in Wash-
ington often forget that the dollars 
that we are debating really aren’t ours. 
They are the next generation’s, and 
this money belongs to that generation 
and to the American people. 
Is it not too much to ask what the 
current administration plans to do 
with the $1 trillion in unspent taxpayer 
funds, Mr. Speaker, especially before 
we toss another $2 trillion on to that 
pile?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H592 
February 24, 2021 
This is a basic question that would 
come up during a family budget discus-
sion with a lot less zeros, much less the 
Government of the United States talk-
ing about trillions of dollars. 
But before and beyond the unspent 
funds, what the Democrat package does 
spend money on is yet another partisan 
wish list with about 9 percent of it ac-
tually going to COVID. Meaning 91 per-
cent of it is not even COVID-related. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill’s minimum 
wage increase, for instance, would kill 
1.4 million blue-collar jobs, and its un-
employment 
insurance 
hike 
would 
keep incentivizing workers to stay at 
home, which is a real struggle in my 
district when an employer wants 2,000 
people to come back to work and they 
are competing with the Federal Gov-
ernment. This makes it worse. 
Under this bill, Mr. Speaker, stim-
ulus checks would go to illegal immi-
grants. Under this bill, taxpayer fund-
ing 
for 
abortion 
is 
allowed, 
and 
Planned Parenthood is eligible for PPP 
loans. Under this bill, funding is al-
lowed to flow to colleges and univer-
sities that partner with companies that 
are controlled by Communist China. 
Under this bill, $110 billion would be 
sent to schools, regardless if they re-
open or not. There is no support for 
families who are desperate for edu-
cational options for their kids. 
Obviously, of course, Democrats hid 
irrelevant spending in this bill, just 
like environmental justice grants, $800 
million in aid to other countries, and a 
$112 million earmark for a big tech sub-
way in Silicon Valley. 
The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is we 
are again debating a liberal wish list 
disguised as COVID relief. The Amer-
ican people aren’t fooled by any of this. 
They see through the game, and they 
know that this town can and should do 
better. 
f 
COLOMBIA FAILS TO PROTECT 
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, over 
the past two decades, I have traveled to 
Colombia more than a dozen times. On 
each trip, I have had the privilege of 
meeting human rights defenders and 
social leaders. 
In cities, towns, and remote rural 
areas, these brave men, women, and 
young people have confronted violence 
all their lives, and they and their com-
munities are targeted by illegal armed 
groups—paramilitaries, guerrillas, and 
criminal organizations. They have been 
targets of the Colombian military and 
too often harassed and under illegal 
surveillance by the state. Simply for 
speaking on behalf of others, orga-
nizing to meet basic needs, or carrying 
out the duties of their profession— 
teacher, doctor, farmer, lawyer, jour-
nalist, and pastor—they are threat-
ened, assaulted, and murdered. 
During my last trip to Colombia, I 
spent a few days in the mountains of 
northern Cauca. I met with indigenous 
leaders defending their right to ances-
tral lands. I met with Afro-Colombian 
leaders creating small enterprises to 
support their families and their chil-
dren. I met with demobilized FARC sol-
diers hoping to build a new life and fu-
ture. I met with campesino farmers de-
termined to stop growing coca and 
move into the legal economy. 
We sat together, and we ate together. 
They shared their plans and they 
shared their dreams with me. They 
dream of a Colombia at peace and a Co-
lombia that values all of its people, in-
cluding those who have struggled to 
survive in Colombia’s most violent 
rural areas. 
Brave, 
generous, 
intelligent, 
cre-
ative, vulnerable, and humble, these 
leaders literally have bet their lives on 
the peace accord being fully imple-
mented. They are counting on the 
peace accord to deliver the protection, 
economic development, truth, and jus-
tice it promised. 
But the Colombian state has aban-
doned them, just as it has throughout 
all Colombia’s history. The state has 
failed to put in place the individual and 
community-based 
protections 
de-
manded by the peace accord. The state 
has failed to dismantle the criminal 
networks and armed actors who daily 
threaten the lives of social leaders. The 
state has failed to identify and pros-
ecute those who finance, profit by, and 
order the murders and violence aimed 
at human rights defenders and social 
leaders. Even worse, the Colombian 
state has chosen to remain absent from 
large parts of the country, failing to 
establish state presence, basic services, 
and leaving local leaders defenseless. 
Since the peace accord was signed, 
over 500 rights defenders have been 
murdered, according to the United Na-
tions human rights representative. Co-
lombia’s own ombudsman reports even 
higher numbers, documenting more 
than 700 murders during that same pe-
riod, and nongovernmental organiza-
tions place the total even higher. 
Rather than seeing this grim reality 
as a call to action, the government of 
President Ivan Duque has tried to ob-
scure the number of murder victims. 
His government defends all the prom-
ises it has made on paper without 
changing by one iota the reality on the 
ground. It acts as if these murders and 
threats were some kind of public rela-
tions crisis, a battle over statistics and 
optics. 
But it is not a PR problem. It is lives 
on the line. Economists have written 
books on the importance of human cap-
ital in the development of a prosperous 
economy. Lack of political will to pre-
vent these murders and protect these 
local leaders is literally bleeding Co-
lombia of the very human capital it 
needs to consolidate peace and create a 
more prosperous and dynamic future. 
Two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch 
issued a report on the murders of Co-
lombia’s social leaders and human 
rights defenders. It outlines practical 
actions and reforms the Colombian fed-
eral, state, and municipal governments 
could take to prevent, reduce, and even 
stop the murders and violence. Sadly, 
these recommendations were met with 
indifference, by hostility, or rejected 
out of hand. They were treated more 
like bad press than a serious attempt 
to offer help and provide a road map to 
interrupt the spiral of violence. 
That is why I am calling on the 
Biden administration to make the pro-
tection of human rights defenders and 
social leaders one of America’s highest 
priorities in its relationship with Co-
lombia. The Biden administration and 
Congress should review the Human 
Rights Watch report and determine 
how U.S. policy and aid can advance 
the full implementation of the peace 
accord, support its protective and jus-
tice mechanisms, and help fulfill its 
promises of economic development in 
neglected areas. 
I call upon my colleagues to stand up 
for peace, for human rights, and for an 
end to the violence against human 
rights defenders and social leaders in 
Colombia. 
These 
courageous 
social 
leaders 
deserve 
nothing 
less 
than 
America’s full and unconditional sup-
port. 
f 
PROTECTING OUR MOST SACRED 
FREEDOMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, government 
intervention often causes more harm 
than good. I have spent my time in 
Congress working to protect individual 
freedoms from unnecessary bureau-
cratic burdens. 
I recognize that a strong family is 
vital to our Nation’s progress and pros-
perity, which is why I have worked to 
advance legislation that allows fami-
lies to flourish and protects life at all 
stages. It is unconscionable that in 
America, where we fight for life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness, we 
tolerate the systemic extermination of 
an entire generation. The right to life 
demands that we protect our Nation’s 
most vulnerable, including the unborn. 
Our First Amendment is a powerful 
instrument that has protected our 
most sacred freedoms for hundreds of 
years. 
b 1015 
Few other countries provide the same 
protections and freedoms that our 
First Amendment guarantees. We are 
the land of the free because of it. Our 
individual liberties are the envy of peo-
ple around the world and they are the 
cornerstone of the world’s oldest de-
mocracy. 
Yet, today, these essential rights are 
under attack. H.R. 5 is the latest exam-
ple of Democrats’ misleading and par-
tisan manner of legislating.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H593 
February 24, 2021 
As a former educator and the Repub-
lican leader of the Education and 
Labor Committee, I can tell you that 
the bill may have equality in the title, 
but it certainly does not serve all 
Americans. 
This legislation has a clever name 
and an allegedly noble purpose, but it 
is a vehicle for serious harmful con-
sequences. 
The Equality Act would empower the 
government to interfere in how regular 
Americans think, speak, and act. Spe-
cifically, it would amend the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 to make sexual ori-
entation and gender identity protected 
classes. According to the National Re-
view, this extreme legislation ‘‘rede-
fines sex to include gender identity, 
undermines religious freedom, gives 
males who identify as females the right 
to women’s spaces, and sets a dan-
gerous 
political 
precedent 
for 
the 
medicalization 
of 
gender-confused 
youth.’’ 
Under H.R. 5, our Nation’s K–12 
schools would be forced to treat gender 
as being fluid, subjective, and not tied 
to biological reality. The bill would un-
dermine Title IX protections for girls 
by outlawing sex-based athletic com-
petitions. 
Even more troubling is the bill’s me-
ticulous and intentional destruction of 
religious freedom protections. 
Religiously-affiliated 
colleges 
and 
universities 
that 
maintain 
student 
codes of conduct, hiring practices, or 
housing rules reflecting sincerely held 
beliefs about marriage and sexuality, 
risk losing Federal funding under the 
Equality Act, as such policies would be 
deemed discriminatory. 
Beloved secular private colleges that 
maintain 
single-sex 
policies, 
like 
Smith College and Morehouse College, 
would be forced to change their poli-
cies or forego Federal funding. 
In the State of Virginia, we have al-
ready seen the displeasure among par-
ents regarding such policy implemen-
tation. In an opinion piece published by 
the Washington Post in 2019, a former 
middle and high school teacher whose 
children 
attend 
Arlington 
public 
schools said: ‘‘It would erode parents’ 
rights over their children’s education, 
corrode Title IX protections for girls, 
and risk convincing healthy, normally 
developing boys and girls that their 
bodies are wrong and must be altered 
with hormones and be vandalized by 
surgical instruments.’’ 
The bill also lacks any pro-life pro-
tections, which is why I am submitting 
my amendment that will protect reli-
giously affiliated groups and individ-
uals from being forced to perform abor-
tions. 
This bill is a brazen attempt to re-
place 
longstanding 
constitutional 
rights with the identity politics of the 
moment. 
We have entered treacherous waters 
by considering legislation that stifles 
proven, bipartisan solutions and, more 
seriously, our Bill of Rights. It is out-
rageous that Democrats would adver-
tise these proposals as guaranteeing 
fundamental civil and legal rights. 
Mr. Speaker, as elected Representa-
tives, we all strive for equality before 
the law, but H.R. 5 is another classic 
example of Democrats passing a law 
now and figuring out what it means 
later. This is no way to legislate. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCGOVERN). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on behalf of the American 
Rescue Plan. 
The critical need to provide eco-
nomic relief for struggling Americans 
and communities across the Nation 
could never be more evident than it is 
now. A year into this pandemic, the 
world is reeling from the fallout of the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
This time last year, we had a handful 
of people that had, sadly, passed away 
from COVID–19 as it slowly made its 
way across the country. This week, we 
mourned over 500,000 lives lost and 
countless family members and loved 
ones that will be impacted forever, and 
we are still not out of the woods. Yes-
terday evening, we appropriately hon-
ored and recognized those Americans 
who lost their lives. 
This pandemic has created a deep 
economic crisis for American families 
and small businesses. Economic inequi-
ties continue to accelerate, sadly. Our 
communities are hurting. They are 
hurting, and the time for decisive ac-
tion is now, just as we did in a bipar-
tisan effort last year. 
Think about it. America—America, 
the richest country in the world, and 
yet the numbers are staggering. Over 
18 million Americans are receiving un-
employment benefits. Nearly 24 million 
Americans are going hungry, including 
12 million children—12 million chil-
dren. And nearly 40 million Americans 
cannot afford to pay the rent and pos-
sibly face eviction. 
We must get more funding to our 
States and local governments so they 
can help those immediately impacted. 
This will allow us to begin to open our 
schools safely, which we must do, in 
addition to the rest of our economy. 
This is a key component of President 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which I 
support. 
Now, let me repeat. The American 
Rescue Plan will work to keep commu-
nities safe and reopen schools with a 
robust vaccine plan for the public and 
educators that has been absent until 
the last 6 weeks. 
In my own circumstance, my own 
constituency, the city of Fresno, in the 
heart of my district is facing a multi- 
million dollar budget shortfall. Like 
most cities across the country, they 
will be forced to cut jobs, including 
those of first responders, without Fed-
eral support. The same is true in the 
communities of Madera and Merced, 
also in my district. 
The American Rescue Plan will bring 
nearly $200 million to these two local 
communities combined, providing crit-
ical relief needed to provide funding for 
services their residents require, my 
constituents. 
Now that vaccines are being adminis-
tered, with millions inoculated so far, 
we have to continue to build on that 
momentum, for gaining the upper hand 
over this disease is on the horizon if we 
stay the course and implement the 
plan the President has outlined. 
But we must do more to help Ameri-
cans than just providing vaccinations. 
Obviously, that is at the front lines, 
and we will produce more vaccines in 
the next month and in the next 2 
months so that, as the President said, 
300 million Americans, by this summer, 
will have the ability to be vaccinated. 
But economic relief is part of the ne-
cessity to help them, and the American 
Rescue Plan does that. 
Now, I have heard some of my col-
leagues on the other side talk about 
the concerns about the fiscal impacts 
to our economy. I am a Blue Dog. I be-
lieve that we need to have fiscal dis-
cipline, and I believe, after being here 
17 years, that happens when Democrats 
are willing to deal with expenditures 
and Republicans are willing to deal 
with revenues. And unless we do deal 
with those two things together it isn’t 
going to happen. 
The last administration indebted this 
Nation over $7.5 trillion—$7.5 trillion 
in the last 4 years. I didn’t hear much 
discussion during that time about the 
fiscal deficit. But I learned another 
thing in 17 years here; when Democrats 
are in charge, the debt matters. But 
when Republicans are in charge, who 
cares? 
So let’s get real about this deficit. 
America is hurting today, and it needs 
our support and it needs our help. 
Over 140 executives of major Amer-
ican corporations are supporting this 
plan. Over 140 of the major companies 
in America think that this is nec-
essary, the $1.9 trillion, to get this 
economy going and to put our country 
back on a track that we can be safe 
from this pandemic. 
So I urge my colleagues to do the 
right thing and to vote in favor of the 
American Rescue Plan, as we did pre-
vious measures on a bipartisan effort. 
f 
CAREER AND TECHNICAL 
EDUCATION MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
February as Career and Technical Edu-
cation Month. Each year, this month 
highlights the benefits of a skills-based 
education and the valuable contribu-
tions that CTE students make to the 
American workforce. 
A one-size-fits-all approach to edu-
cation is not an effective way to pre-
pare students for the workforce. We are

doing students a great disservice when 
we only promote what is considered a 
traditional college experience. 
My appreciation for CTE came at an 
early age. My father, after leaving the 
Navy, went through a CTE program, 
which led him to a job as a tool and die 
maker. Eventually, he decided to start 
his own business, which became quite 
successful. 
As co-chair of the Career and Tech-
nical Education Caucus, and a senior 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, I have also sup-
ported, and will continue to support, 
CTE programs that provide learners of 
all ages with career-ready skills. 
From agriculture to the arts, from 
marketing to manufacturing, CTE pro-
grams work to develop America’s most 
valuable resource, its people. 
CTE has established itself as a path 
that 
many 
high-achieving 
students 
choose in pursuit of industry certifi-
cation and hands-on skills that they 
can use right out of school, in skill- 
based education programs, or in col-
lege. 
Congress recognized the importance 
of CTE when we passed the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education 
for the 21st Century Act, which helps 
close the skills gap by modernizing the 
Federal investment in CTE programs 
and connecting educators with indus-
try stakeholders. This bill was later 
signed into law by President Trump in 
2018. 
While this is a major milestone, 
there is still more work to be done. 
That is why I am supporting additional 
pieces of legislation on the horizon to 
keep updating and promoting work-
force development throughout our Na-
tion. These include: 
The Skills Renewals Act, which cre-
ates a flexible skills training credit in 
the amount of $4,000 per person that 
may be applied to cover the cost of a 
wide range of training programs that 
build skills expected to be in high de-
mand by employers in the coming 
months. 
There is also the Skills Investment 
Act, which enhances the Coverdell edu-
cation 
savings 
accounts—tax-advan-
taged savings accounts for educational 
expenses—so American workers can use 
the accounts to pay for their skills- 
based learning, career training, and 
workforce development. 
And lastly, the Cybersecurity Skills 
Integration Act, which creates a $10 
million pilot program within the De-
partment of Education to award com-
petitive grants to education-employer 
partnerships for the development and 
implementation, and/or expansion of 
postsecondary CTE programs that inte-
grate cybersecurity education into cur-
ricula preparing students for careers in 
critical infrastructure sectors. 
COVID–19 has demonstrated the need 
for CTE. Many of those who have been 
deemed as life-essential employees are 
those who have made their way to 
those jobs through the Career and 
Technical Education pathway. It gives 
people from all walks of life an oppor-
tunity to succeed and restores rungs on 
the ladder of opportunity. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to encourage my colleagues to join my 
co-chair and I, Mr. LANGEVIN, on the bi-
partisan Career and Technical Edu-
cation Caucus, to help us equip individ-
uals of all ages with the skills nec-
essary to fill jobs now and in the fu-
ture.

BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN 
HISTORY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COSTA). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Ms. 
BOURDEAUX) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, as February becomes March, 
Black History Month comes to an end. 
But I want to be clear, every month is 
Black History Month because Black 
history is American history. 
Today, I am thinking of the amazing 
Black women and men who inspire us 
daily and who changed the world. 
I am thinking of Ruby Bridges who, 
at only 6 years old, became the first 
Black student to integrate a southern 
elementary school. 
I am thinking of Gwinnett’s own 
Beauty Baldwin, the first Black woman 
to be a school superintendent in Geor-
gia. 
I am thinking of Hank Aaron, who 
showed the world the meaning of Black 
excellence when he broke Babe Ruth’s 
home run record, and he was a proud 
Georgian. 
I am thinking of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., an Atlanta preacher who 
shared his dream with the world and, 
in the process, changed it forever. 
And I am thinking of Senator RAPH-
AEL WARNOCK, who preached from the 
same pulpit as Dr. King, and who now 
follows in his footsteps as an advocate 
for change. 
b 1030 
I am thinking of KAMALA HARRIS, our 
Nation’s first Black and first female 
Vice President, and of all the Black 
and Brown girls around the country 
who are finally able to look at the 
White House and see themselves re-
flected there. 
Finally, I am thinking of our beloved 
Georgia friend, mentor, and colleague, 
John Lewis. Congressman Lewis would 
have turned 81 this weekend. Congress-
man Lewis spent his life getting into 
good trouble. 
At 21, he was one of the original 13 
Freedom Riders. At 23, as the chairman 
of SNCC, he spoke at the March on 
Washington. At 25, he led the march 
from Selma to Montgomery, in the 
process withstanding all the violence 
and hatred local and State officials 
could throw at him. 
Congressman Lewis went on to serve 
Atlanta on both the city council and in 
Congress for more than 35 years, be-
coming the conscience of the Congress. 
The tireless work of heroes like John 
Lewis pushes me to continue pursuing 
equitable and just policies. Over the 
past 2 years, our country has had a 
much-needed awakening to the sys-
temic inequality people of color face 
every single day. I promise to continue 
using my privilege as a Member of Con-
gress to try to break down that in-
equality wherever it is found. 
In that spirit, I am proud to be co-
sponsoring some critical pieces of leg-
islation being considered in Congress: 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a trans-
formational bill that seeks to ensure 
free and fair elections and easy access 
to the ballot box, to secure nonpartisan 
redistricting, and to put people over 
dark money and special interests in 
elections; the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, the first-ever bold, com-
prehensive approach to holding police 
accountable, changing the culture of 
law enforcement and building trust be-
tween law enforcement and our com-
munities by addressing systemic rac-
ism and biases in order to help save 
lives; H.R. 40, which creates a commis-
sion to study reparations; H.R. 55, the 
Emmett Till Antilynching Act; H.R. 
959 to address the Black maternal mor-
tality crisis in America; a resolution to 
recognize the difficulty Black veterans 
face when returning home after serving 
our country; and a resolution to award 
the Congressional Gold Medal, Con-
gress’ highest honor, to the Freedom 
Riders. 
Of course, while it hasn’t been intro-
duced, you can be certain my name will 
be one of the first ones signed up to co-
sponsor the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act, which will restore and modernize 
portions of the Voting Rights Act 
scrapped by the Supreme Court. The 
right to vote is sacred. John Lewis 
knew that better than most, and we 
must protect it. 
Nor is it enough to sign on to these 
pieces of legislation and call it a day. 
Just as Black history should be cele-
brated every month, every piece of leg-
islation we consider must also be 
looked at for how it will impact our 
Black communities. 
Mr. Speaker, as I deliver remarks 
today in celebration of Black History 
Month, I would be wrong to not ac-
knowledge that yesterday was the 1- 
year anniversary of the murder—yes, 
the murder—of Ahmaud Arbery. A 
young man from my State of Georgia, 
Ahmaud was killed while going out for 
a jog, a simple luxury that so many of 
us enjoy without fear of harm. 
Ahmaud’s case and the way it was 
handled continue to show us all that 
inherent biases and systemic racism re-
main prevalent in our society. We here 
on this floor must do everything we 
can to break those barriers down. You 
have my word, I will continue to do so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H595 
February 24, 2021 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate an invalu-
able member of my staff on her well- 
deserved retirement. Jacquelyn Smith, 
‘‘Jackie’’ to those of us who love her, 
retires this week, Mr. Speaker, after 
two decades of service to the Fourth 
Congressional District and more than a 
half century of work in government, 
education, and politics. 
Her contributions to the State of 
Florida and to her colleagues are im-
measurable, and our Nation is truly 
better off thanks to her efforts. 
Jackie began her life of service as a 
teacher, moving often because of her 
husband’s assignment as a United 
States Air Force pilot. 
She eventually found herself in poli-
tics, working on a Presidential cam-
paign before eventually becoming dis-
trict 
director 
to 
my 
predecessor, 
former Congressman Ander Crenshaw. 
When I took office in 2017, I was fortu-
nate that Jackie stayed on as the di-
rector of special operations in my 
Jacksonville office. 
Mr. Speaker, for over 20 years, Jackie 
has served northeast Florida. She has 
helped countless families with case-
work, served as my representative 
throughout the district, and made a 
significant impact on thousands of 
young people and students in our com-
munity. 
Jackie has truly helped shape the 
next generation of Americans, espe-
cially those who will be going into 
military leadership. Each year, Jackie 
runs the military academy nomination 
program. She works tirelessly with 
students who apply, coaching them 
through the process and vouching for 
their selection. 
Mr. Speaker, I can tell you no one 
knows nor works that system harder 
and better than Jackie Smith. And she 
does it simply for the benefit of her 
students. Thanks to her efforts, Dis-
trict Four historically has one of the 
highest selection rates in the country. 
Jackie also runs our congressional 
arts program and the congressional 
medal program, both recognizing the 
many talented students in our commu-
nity of northeast Florida. 
Jackie often serves as my liaison to 
community groups, many of which she 
is already a part of, including the Ro-
tary Club, the USO, and the local 
Chamber of Commerce. It often seems 
she knows everyone in northeast Flor-
ida, and unsurprisingly, they all con-
sider her a friend. She loves them, and 
they love her. 
Every day, Jackie comes to work 
with a servant’s heart, a sharp wit, and 
a contagious optimistic attitude. No 
job is too big; no job is too small. Most 
importantly, she embodies the virtues 
of integrity, hard work, and selfless-
ness that Americans expect from their 
government. 
Jackie leaves big shoes to fill in my 
office. However, as she is known to do, 
she leaves it better than when she 
found it. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, congratula-
tions, Jackie. May your retirement be 
filled with warm, sandy beaches and 
continued memories with your hus-
band, David, and your many friends 
and loved ones. We are so proud of your 
many achievements, and we thank you, 
Jackie, for your service to this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you, I 
look forward to hearing all about her 
next career as a used shoe salesman for 
Ocean Sole Africa, as they improve the 
lives of citizens of Kenya and boost the 
economy here at home.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAUL 
MONTES, SR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to honor a family man, a caring 
neighbor, and a selfless public servant, 
my dear friend Raul Montes, Sr. 
Raul was the ward superintendent for 
the 22nd Ward in the city of Chicago, a 
community known as Little Village. 
Raul and I share a common back-
ground. We both came to this country 
at a young age, settled in the Chicago 
neighborhood of Little Village, and 
started organizing for the improvement 
of our neighborhood and for the greater 
political representation of Chicago’s 
Latino community. 
Raul created a block club in our 
neighborhood that worked to improve 
and beautify homes, backyards, and 
streets. They installed lamps in their 
front lawns, planted sod in the park-
ways, and established block watches 
and activities for children and teens. 
This deep involvement in community 
life is why I appointed Raul as a Demo-
cratic precinct captain of the sixth pre-
cinct when I was a member of Chicago 
City Council. He was the most effective 
and beloved precinct captain in Chi-
cago’s 22nd Ward. His hard work helped 
me and many others win elected office. 
As ward superintendent in the De-
partment of Streets and Sanitation, he 
was 
frequently 
seen 
driving 
down 
streets and alleys, conversing with 
neighbors, and paying personal atten-
tion to their service requests. Even 
after he retired, he would ride around 
the neighborhood, asking people if they 
needed anything to be fixed in their 
homes or streets. 
Raul organized the best block parties 
and loved to sing and dance with his 
wife, Maria. They enjoyed traveling, 
spending 
time 
with 
their 
grand-
children, and, of course, having big par-
ties. He also enjoyed helping out at the 
corner grocery store or restaurant to 
stay busy and catch up on what was 
going on in the neighborhood after he 
retired. 
Last month, Raul died of COVID–19, 
leaving a huge void in his family, his 
neighborhood, and the entire southwest 
side of Chicago. Today, we recognize 
his labor in the House of Representa-
tives. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
A few words in Spanish. Today in the 
United States Congress we recognize 
the friendship, work, and efforts of a 
great public servant. Rau´ l Montes was 
a great superintendent of the 22nd Dis-
trict and Little Village community. We 
celebrate his life, all his efforts, and 
we’d like to express to Rau´ l’s family 
that his life was well lived, and for that 
reason, we give him this recognition. 
Unas palabras en espan˜ ol. Hoy en el 
Congreso 
de 
los 
Estados 
Unidos 
reconocemos la amistad, las labores, 
los esfuerzos de un gran servidor 
pu´ blico. Rau´ l Montes fue un gran 
superintendente de nuestra comunidad 
en 
La 
Villita 
y

Distrito

Celebramos su vida, todos sus esfuerzos 
y le comunicamos a su familia que la 
vida de Raul Montes fue bien vivida, y 
por eso le hacemos ese reconocimiento. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Raul Montes, 
rest in power, my friend. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois will provide the 
Clerk a translation of his remarks. 
f 
PRODUCERS WORKING HARD FOR 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to thank the farmers and ranchers 
whose work does not stop. 
Even in the face of extreme freezing 
temperatures this month, the likes of 
which we have not seen in decades, 
Kansas stood strong and got the job 
done. 
The big First District of Kansas is 
one of the most productive agricultural 
areas in the country. The district is 
home to more than 60,000 farms and is 
made up of farmers, ranchers, feedlot 
managers, nutritionists, ethanol pro-
ducers, ag lenders, and agribusiness 
owners who feed, fuel, and clothe the 
world. 
I grew up in Quinter, and I spent 
thousands of hours on a tractor in 
fields and on horseback, doctoring cat-
tle in our family’s feed yard. I know 
well agriculture’s working conditions 
are demanding on a good day, but espe-
cially so when our business partner, 
Mother Nature, is as unforgiving as she 
has been lately. 
In the past month, Kansas spent 13 
consecutive days with temperatures 
below freezing. This is a stretch of 
freezing temperatures we have not seen 
in our State for nearly 40 years. 
But those who stand with snow up to 
their knees in the depths of winter or 
haul water in the drought of summer 
know agriculture does not take days 
off. No matter the temperature, our ag 
producers head to work long before 
most of us are awake and stay out 
until many of us have already laid our 
heads down at night. 
They are people like Cody and Ashley 
Bornholdt of Inman, who bust ice by 
hand at all hours so their cattle have 
access to water and are still able to 
joke that after several days of negative

temperatures, zero degrees feels like a 
heat wave. 
They are people like Gary Capoun of 
Alma, who delivers baby calves and 
hauls them on the floorboard of his 
pickup to someplace warmer where 
they can be bottle-fed to ensure that 
they get the nutrients needed to grow 
and survive in the wind chills. 
They are the men and women staying 
up through the night so a baby animal 
gets a shot at life, a piece of equipment 
is ready to go early the next morning, 
the neighboring producer has the help 
they need to milk their herd, and so 
people like you and I have a safe and 
secure food supply. 
As many across the country learned 
this last spring, our food does not come 
from a grocery store shelf. The impor-
tance of the agriculture and food sup-
ply chain cannot be overstated. This 
supply chain represents millions of 
people working every day in the U.S. It 
begins with farmers, ranchers, and 
growers, and it includes food processors 
and manufacturers, shippers, transpor-
tation workers, and, finally, those 
working in the grocery stores and res-
taurants. Each of these people is vital 
in ensuring we have food on our plates. 
While most of us in the ‘‘Big First’’ 
of Kansas know how important agri-
culture is, I know that message can 
sometimes be lost on the way to the 
grocery store. So on behalf of Kansans 
and all Americans, I share a sincere 
thank-you to the farmers, ranchers, 
and producers who supply our food, 
fuel, and fiber. 
Thank you. Thank you for pulling 
the baby calf out of the snowbank and 
nursing it back to life. Thank you for 
busting ice early and feeding hay late. 
Thank you for putting the needs of 
your 
livestock 
before 
yourselves. 
Thank you for your never-ending, 
backbreaking days. Thank you for, es-
pecially on cold days, working so hard 
for the extra hours and extra strength. 
Your efforts feed us and keep us warm, 
too. 
It is an honor to represent you in the 
U.S. House of Representatives and on 
the House Agriculture Committee. May 
God bless you. 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL FFA WEEK 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
today to celebrate National FFA Week. 
The national FFA organization was 
founded by a group of young farmers in 
1928 as the Future Farmers of America. 
Their mission was to prepare future 
generations for the challenges of feed-
ing the world. 
Today, more than 760,000 blue cor-
duroy jacket-wearing FFA members in 
more than 8,700 chapters across the 
country, and more than 9,600 members 
in 220 chapters in Kansas alone, are 
still working hard to advance our Na-
tion’s most critical industry, food and 
agriculture. 
b 1045 
These members are our future farm-
ers, ranchers, engineers, doctors, law-
yers, teachers, scientists, communica-
tors, and businesspeople. They are the 
next generation of leaders. 
This week, they will celebrate Na-
tional FFA Week as a long-held tradi-
tion during George Washington’s birth-
day to respect agriculture’s heritage 
and recognize its future. 
As a past chapter FFA president 
from Quinter, Kansas, and a proud FFA 
alumnus, I am honored to join nearly 
80 of my colleagues to introduce H. 
Res. 150, expressing support for the des-
ignation of February 20 to February 27, 
2021, as National FFA Week, recog-
nizing the important role of the Na-
tional FFA Organization in providing 
the next generation of leaders who will 
change the world, and celebrating 50 
years of National FFA Alumni and 
Supporters. 
Kansas FFA and the National FFA 
Organization have had a profound im-
pact on me. FFA taught me belonging 
when I put on my FFA jacket the first 
time, responsibility when caring for 
my family’s livestock in the bitter win-
ters and drought-ridden summers, and 
pride in sharing about the organization 
I love on the House floor today. 
Because of FFA and the next genera-
tion of agriculture, I know our bright-
est days are ahead. 
Happy National FFA Week.

HONORING THE LIFE OF W. 
EUGENE BURRELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a community leader 
and 
longtime 
friend, 
W. 
Eugene 
Burrell, of Fannett, Texas, who passed 
away on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, 
at the age of 86. 
Eugene was a lifelong cattle rancher, 
rice farmer, and civic leader in south-
east Texas. He had the respect of all 
who knew him. Eugene was born on Oc-
tober the 27, 1934, in Beaumont, Texas, 
to Louise DeVillier Burrell, and Walter 
Jordan Burrell. 
He began farming rice at the age of 18 
and worked in that role until the age of 
21, when he decided to serve his coun-
try in the United States Army. 
After serving the Army from 1955 to 
1957, where he was stationed overseas 
in Germany, Eugene returned home 
and continued rice farming, an occupa-
tion that would last for 52 years. 
Apart from growing rice, he was also 
a dedicated cattle rancher for more 
than 70 years. Eugene served as a board 
member on numerous industry and 
community boards, such as the Amer-
ican Rice, Inc., board in Houston; 
American 
Rice 
Growers 
board 
in 
Cheek, Texas; the Coastal Cattlemen’s 
Association board; the Equalization 
Board from the Jefferson County Ap-
praisal District; the West Jefferson 
County Municipal Water District; and 
the Texas Rice Festival, where he vol-
unteered with his wife, Sandra, who 
was the love of his life. 
In 1999, Eugene was named the Texas 
Rice Festival Farmer of the Year, and 
subsequently its Pioneer Farmer of the 
Year in 2017. His steadfast faith was al-
ways very important to him. In fact, he 
served as a member of St. Mary’s 
Fannett Knights of Columbus organiza-
tion. 
In addition to ‘‘Eugene,’’ his friends 
and family lovingly referred to him as 
‘‘Dad,’’ 
‘‘Pawpaw,’’ 
‘‘Boogie,’’ 
and 
‘‘Fred.’’ Supporting his children, and 
later his grandchildren, by attending 
their sporting events and various com-
petitions over the years was always a 
very top priority to him. 
Eugene is survived by his loving wife 
of 63 years, Sandra Ray Burrell; daugh-
ter Karen Burrell Reneau and her hus-
band, Charlie; daughter Kelly Burrell 
Alton and her husband, Randy; son, 
Troy Eugene Burrell and his wife, 
Shelly; grandchildren Landon Reneau 
and his wife, Hillary; William Reneau 
and his wife, Amanda; Lane Stuart; 
Reid Alton; Mary Alton; Abby Alton; 
Cody Burrell; Cameron Burrell and his 
wife, Lauren; great-grandchildren Eli 
Reneau, 
Ella 
Reneau, 
and 
Bryar 
Burrell; and numerous nieces and neph-
ews. 
He is preceded in death by his par-
ents, Louise and Walter Burrell; and 
his brother, James Jack Burrell. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor 
my friend W. Eugene Burrell for his 
very many years of faithful service to 
his community. 
My thoughts and prayers remain 
with his family and friends during this 
very difficult time. 
May God bless his family. 
f 
DISAPPOINTING COVID RELIEF 
PACKAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
express my deep disappointment on the 
bloated, partisan bill that my col-
leagues are calling a COVID relief 
package. 
That is the name on the bill, but the 
reality is far from it. The reality is 
that we just passed a $900 billion pack-
age in December. The package wasn’t 
perfect, but it was bipartisan. This one 
is not. 
The reality is that hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars remain unspent. As of 
last week, there were unofficial esti-
mates of unspent or non-disbursed re-
lief that included $183 billion for an-
other round of PPP; $199 billion for 
healthcare; $136 billion for expanded 
unemployment insurance; and $46 bil-
lion for direct stimulus payments. 
That is money we still have, unspent. 
The reality is that this administra-
tion can’t or won’t even give Congress 
an honest estimate of where that 
money is and what they will do with 
trillions more. 
The reality is that this bill is not for 
emergency relief, but for leftwing 
spending programs years from now. 
Nearly half of the funds under this bill 
won’t be spent until 2022.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H597 
February 24, 2021 
There are billions of dollars for State 
and local governments, mostly to blue 
States that impose costly lockdowns, 
even though California is reporting a 
$10 billion surplus; billions to bail out 
multiemployer pension plans; billions 
for subsidies to cover the cost of rising 
ObamaCare premiums; and a massive 
expansion of Medicaid with no reforms 
to address waste, fraud, and abuse 
within the program. 
Meanwhile, a mere 1 percent of this 
is for vaccine distribution. Really? 
Maybe that is, perhaps, because the 
Trump 
administration, 
indeed, 
did 
have a plan for vaccine distribution. I 
don’t know. 
Of the billions they provide for 
schools, less than 5 percent will be 
spent this fiscal year with zero require-
ments to get kids back in the class-
room. 
The reality is that some provisions, 
like a $15 minimum wage will only hurt 
the small businesses that Democrats 
claim they want to help. Many in my 
district have already told me they are 
going to lay off workers or shut down. 
So I say this to my colleagues who 
seem to believe that the size of their 
heart is correlated to how much tax-
payer money they are willing to spend: 
This is not how you help. This is not 
how you govern responsibly. This is not 
a contest to see how much debt we can 
rack up for whatever constituency or 
special interest you favor at the mo-
ment. 
Americans 
don’t 
want 
handouts. 
They want a vaccine. They want their 
businesses open. They want their kids 
back in school because they know it is 
safe, despite what the teachers’ unions 
are saying. And they don’t want to be 
told to wear three masks after they get 
a vaccine. 
If you want to work with Repub-
licans, assess what has been spent and 
what hasn’t and focus on small busi-
ness relief that increases jobs instead 
of killing them, then Republicans will 
be right there with you. Until then, ex-
pect some serious opposition. 
RECOGNIZING THE TREMENDOUS STRENGTH OF 
THE PEOPLE IN HOUSTON 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I also 
rise today to recognize the tremendous 
the strength of the people in Houston, 
who I am honored to represent in Con-
gress. 
As we all know, last week, an his-
toric arctic blast hit most of the 
South, including the great State of 
Texas, plunging millions of Texans into 
darkness. In the middle of freezing cold 
temperatures, people weren’t able to 
heat their homes or access water. I per-
sonally had to gather water from a 
swimming pool in our apartment com-
plex after our water was shut off. 
I know that many had it much, much 
worse than I did. But through it all, 
the community came together. My 
friend Jim McIngvale, known as Mat-
tress Mack, in Houston opened up his 
furniture store as a shelter last week 
to give people in need a warm place to 
sleep, eat or just get out of the cold for 
a few hours. 
There 
are 
countless 
others 
who 
stepped up. Plumbers helped their 
neighbors repair their pipes free of 
charge; food and water distribution 
centers opened up across the city, in-
cluding in my district office; and peo-
ple who had power used it minimally so 
electricity could flow back to their 
neighbors faster. This is what we call 
Houston strong. 
It got us through Harvey and Imelda, 
and it is what will get us through this 
difficult time as well. 
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO FEDERAL PROTECTIVE 
SERVICE 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to wish a happy 50th anniversary 
to the Federal Protective Service. 
I thank the 1,400 members of FPS, 
the men and women who protect the 
more than 9,500 Federal facilities, and 
the 1.4 million employees who work in 
those buildings on a daily basis. 
All too often, you only gain atten-
tion when tragedy strikes, whether it 
is the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing or, 
just last year, bravely defending the 
Federal courthouse in Portland. 
I wish to remind Americans that it is 
every day that they are there holding 
the line. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell you 
we are thankful and we are appre-
ciative of their service, and their com-
mitment to keeping our Nation safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of 
the FPS and I wish them a happy 50th 
anniversary.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SHERIFF 
RANDY ROYAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in remembrance of 
Sheriff Randy Royal, who recently 
passed away at the age of 57. 
Sheriff Royal served Ware County in 
Waycross, Georgia, to the best of his 
ability throughout his four terms. He 
was known as a man of faith and deep 
commitment to bettering his commu-
nity and those around him. Everyone 
he worked with can attest to his excep-
tional work ethic, focus, and innova-
tive mindset. 
Sheriff Royal selflessly worked with-
out ever complaining, and his legacy 
will surely last for countless years to 
come. I am thankful for the life he 
lived, as Waycross is better off because 
of him. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
Sheriff Royal’s family, friends, cowork-
ers, and all who knew him during this 
most difficult time. 
MIGHTY EIGHTH MUSEUM 25TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to wish a happy 25 
birthday to the National Museum of 
the Mighty Eighth Air Force. 
Located only minutes from down-
town Savannah, where the Eighth Air 
Force was activated in 1942, the mu-
seum features over 90,000 square feet of 
exhibits, interactive displays, histor-
ical artifacts, and a remarkable collec-
tion of aviation art. 
Throughout its existence, the Mighty 
Eighth Museum has preserved stories 
of courage, character, and patriotism 
displayed by the men and women of the 
Eighth Air Force from World War II to 
the present. 
One of the projects they worked on in 
recent years, is the B–17 restoration 
project. Once completed, the B–17 Fly-
ing Fortress ‘‘City of Savannah’’ will 
be restored to its full combat configu-
ration, including operational systems 
and components. The goal of the 
project is to make the finest static B– 
17 bomber display in the world. 
As the former mayor of Pooler, I 
have a deep appreciation for the mu-
seum and its contributions to the 
Pooler community. I am thankful for 
all of the Mighty Eighth’s wonderful 
volunteers and workers throughout the 
past 25 years, and I am especially 
grateful for the men and women the 
museum honors. 
THIOKOL CHEMICAL EXPLOSION WOODBINE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
those who lost their lives or were in-
jured during the tragic explosion that 
occurred 50 years ago at Thiokol Chem-
ical in Woodbine. 
On Wednesday, February 3, 1971, a 
fire at the Thiokol munitions factory 
just outside of Woodbine triggered a 
chain reaction of blazes, culminating 
with an explosion that filled the sky 
with flames. 
The horrible event caused the loss of 
29 lives and at least 50 others were in-
jured. Those employees were heroes, as 
they were working to help our country 
during wartime with commitment and 
courage. 
Following the event, the Thiokol Me-
morial Project was founded to keep the 
story of that terrible day alive and to 
remember the victims. 
I have had the pleasure of meeting 
folks from the organization and I have 
been encouraged by the work they have 
done to ensure every victim is properly 
remembered and honored. The Thiokol 
Memorial Project maintains a beau-
tiful exhibit in Kingsland, Georgia. 
Although it has been 50 years, the 
event and the victims will never be for-
gotten. 
RECOGNIZING PHARMACIES NATIONWIDE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize pharmacies 
assisting in the COVID–19 vaccine ad-
ministration across the country. 
Thanks to former President Trump’s 
Operation Warp Speed, the vaccine is 
now available to about 6,500 phar-
macies nationwide. It is expected that 
the COVID–19 vaccine will eventually 
be shipped to roughly 40,000 pharmacies 
across the country. 
Many of the participating phar-
macies have gone above and beyond in 
their administration of the vaccine 
doses. For instance, recently, at Costco 
in Oregon, an elderly couple scheduled 
vaccinations for themselves within 20

and safety in receiving the doses. 
As a lifelong pharmacist, I thor-
oughly understand the vital role phar-
macists play in fighting viruses, from 
administering flu shots to COVID–19 
vaccines. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all par-
ticipating pharmacies for their diligent 
work in ensuring safe and effective 
vaccine 
administration 
across 
the 
country. We can look forward to a 
brighter future because of them. 
f 
EQUALITY ACT NEEDS TO BE 
STRUCK DOWN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in defense of women, 
girls, and children. 
I would like to talk about the Equal-
ity Act. It is a bill that we will be vot-
ing on this week. It is a bill that was 
passed before, but it is a bill that needs 
to be struck down. This is a bill that 
will add sexual orientation and gender 
identity as protected classes under the 
Federal 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
We live in a nation—thank God—that 
declares all of us equal. There should 
not be discrimination of anyone in the 
United States of America, and I fully 
believe that. But I ask everyone to 
take pause and truly consider what the 
Equality Act will do, because it has 
very serious consequences. 
You see, women have come very far 
in America and our rights are ex-
tremely important. The work of our 
grandmothers and mothers to declare 
women as equal and push our way into 
the workplace and into sports has been 
a remarkable achievement. 
Voting, being able to own businesses, 
achieve education the same as men in 
America is a gift that I feel so honored 
and blessed by. I know that every 
American woman treasures this. 
b 1100 
You see, the Equality Act will 
change all of that, because it will put 
trans rights above women’s rights, 
above the rights of our daughters, our 
sisters, our friends, our grandmothers, 
our aunts. It is too much. 
Mr. Speaker, you see, as a woman, I 
have competed in sports, and I am so 
thrilled that I was able to do that, but 
I competed against biological women. 
It is a wonderful thing to be able to 
compete and prove yourself. Competi-
tion is a great, great thing. Little girls 
all over the country play sports. They 
play their hearts out, they practice, 
they enjoy time with their friends, 
then they compete at higher levels 
where they can earn scholarships, 
where they can go to college and 
achieve 
and 
receive 
an 
education 
through playing a sport for their uni-
versity or college. 
There are women that move on into 
professional sports fields and do re-
markable things, incredible things for 
women. For example, Florence Griffith 
Joyner became the fastest woman in 
the world in 1988 when she ran the 100- 
meter dash in 10.49 seconds. I could 
only dream of being that fast. But in 
2019, Matthew Boling caught the fast-
est high school 100-meter time ever in 
9.98 seconds, an entire half-second 
quicker than the fastest woman in the 
world. 
Biological women cannot compete 
against biological men. Biological lit-
tle girls cannot compete against bio-
logical little boys. And they shouldn’t 
have to. 
I have a daughter that is a D–1 ath-
lete. We traveled the country for 10 
years where she competed at the high-
est level. She earned her scholarship, 
and now she plays fast-pitch softball. 
And I can’t tell you how much fun I 
had watching her play this weekend, 
and she had a home run. But if she has 
to compete against boys in her sport, 
not only will they be on her playing 
field and she has to compete against 
them; they will be in her locker room; 
they will be in her showers; they will 
be in her bathroom; they will be in her 
hotel room when she travels with her 
team—all under the Equality Act. This 
is wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, this isn’t about polit-
ical parties. It is not about Democrat, 
Republican. This is about right and 
wrong. This is about girls’ and women’s 
rights. 
Furthermore, it affects women in 
prison. Trans men, biological men that 
identify as women, will be put with 
women in prison. 
Battered women’s shelters, women 
that have been beaten and abused by 
men will have men in their battered 
women’s shelters. 
Drug rehab centers—and the list goes 
on and on. 
Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to stop 
discrimination of a class of people, but 
it is another thing to completely vio-
late and destroy the rights of girls and 
women in order to achieve this. This 
bill must be struck down. It is com-
pletely wrong. 
Furthermore, we are in an institu-
tion where it says, ‘‘In God we trust.’’ 
Well, it says in Genesis: God created us 
male and female. In his image, he cre-
ated us. Science has two sets of chro-
mosomes that prove male and female. 
Mr. Speaker, 80 to 95 percent of chil-
dren with gender dysphoria completely 
outgrow it after puberty. The Equality 
Act will force doctors and nurses to 
perform mastectomies on girls that 
want to have their breasts removed. It 
will force doctors also to perform abor-
tions, because according to the Equal-
ity Act, a doctor cannot say no. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that everyone 
please pause and consider, and vote 
‘‘no’’ for the Equality Act. We can’t do 
this in America, and it needs to stop 
with political parties.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
By Your mercies, O Lord, we present 
ourselves to You this day, bringing 
with us not just diverse attitudes and a 
range of passions, but deeply held opin-
ions which we truly believe are offered 
in faith. 
We reluctantly admit that it is our 
faith that confounds us, for as we dare 
to interpret Your will and attempt to 
live into Your intent, we find ourselves 
viscerally at odds with the very ones 
with whom You have caused us to 
serve. 
Renew our minds, individually and 
collectively, that we would not be con-
formed to the divisive patterns of this 
world but transformed by Your grace. 
May we not think so highly of our-
selves that we fail to be reasonable or 
use careful judgment. Remind us that 
as Members of this one body, we are 
called to live in peace, to be thankful, 
to admonish in love. 
Then together, in faith, enable us to 
discern Your will to determine what 
really is good, pleasing, and appro-
priate for our country, for our commu-
nity, and for our Congress. 
We offer ourselves, our words and 
deeds, praying in Your most holy 
name. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF SPECIALIST DERRICK AMELI 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and service of Spe-
cialist Derrick Ameli, a member of the 
Minnesota National Guard from Sav-
age, Minnesota. 
Derrick was a husband, a brother, a 
friend and Guardsman whose service 
honored our community. Tragically, 
Derrick died by suicide last month, 
falling victim to the sometimes fatal 
disease of depression. 
Like any ailment, no one is immune. 
Depression can and does take the very 
best of us. Addressing this epidemic is 
one of the Nation’s most urgent chal-
lenges. But in order to combat this dis-
ease, we must first destigmatize men-
tal health treatment. 
In order to give our neighbors and 
our families the help they deserve, 
they need to feel safe and supported 
asking for treatment. We must begin 
treating mental health as the chronic 
illnesses they can be, for Derrick and 
for so many others who we have lost. 
f 
GOVERNING REQUIRES 
COMPROMISE 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, Demo-
crats won the House by the slimmest of 
margins in November. In fact, it is the 
slimmest 
Democrat 
majority 
since 
1875, a mere five seats. 31,718 votes are 
what determines the majority. Their 
victory in the other branches was also 
tight, 50/50 on the Senate side. 
Usually, when one party has a tiny 
majority, they recognize that gov-
erning requires compromise. Not this 
majority. 
Less than 2 months into controlling 
the House, despite promising to solve 
problems 
and 
restore 
democracy, 
Democrats have proven that their pri-
mary goal is not governing but griev-
ance, the politics of censorship, not 
common ground. 
In January, they eliminated the mo-
tion to recommit, the last chance for 
the minority to improve legislation, 
without a single Republican vote. It 
will go down in history as the first 
time in the history of this body that a 
majority did that, deny the minority, 
the millions of constituents, their 
voice. 
Already, millions have lost their 
voice in Congress due to the brazen 
partisanship. 
What 
Democrats 
are 
doing this week is even worse. 
Today, 
they 
will 
hold 
a 
sub-
committee hearing that will focus on 
broadcasters’ and cable news’ devotion 
to journalistic integrity. This expla-
nation should concern every American. 
It has never been Congress’ role to 
define and enforce journalistic stand-
ards. The First Amendment expressly 
prohibits the government from control-
ling what the press says. 
But Democrats are trying to give 
themselves the power to dictate what 
you can read and watch in your own 
home. And their assault on free speech 
goes beyond today’s disgraceful hear-
ing. 
On Monday, Representatives ESHOO 
and MCNERNEY sent a letter to 12 cable, 
streaming, and satellite companies, es-
sentially threatening them to remove 
‘‘Fox News’’, ‘‘Newsmax’’, and ‘‘One 
America News Network’’ from their 
airways. 
Here is just a quick snapshot of the 
answers they are demanding from the 
carriers: 
‘‘What moral or ethical principles do 
you apply in deciding which channels 
to carry or when to take adverse ac-
tions against a channel?’’ 
‘‘What steps did you take to monitor, 
respond to, and reduce the spread of 
disinformation, including encourage-
ment or incitement of violence by 
channels your company disseminates 
to millions of Americans?’’ 
Then the other question, coming 
from Congress in a majority of a com-
mittee: ‘‘Are you planning to continue 
to carry ‘Fox News’, ‘Newsmax’, ‘One 
America News Network’, both now and 
beyond any contract renewal date? If 
so, why?’’ 
Now, I am not an attorney, but some 
people have asked me, does that reach 
an ethical complaint against these 
Members by using undue influence? 
I don’t know. I guess the Ethics Com-
mittee would have to decide that. 
These are Members of Congress who 
are using their official position to co-
erce and control the information Amer-
icans can watch and access in their 
own homes. They are demanding more 
censorship, more deplatforming, and 
more control of what Americans can 
watch. 
In 
their 
letter, 
Congresswoman 
ESHOO
and Congressman MCNERNEY 
suggest that censorship is necessary 
because conservative views are not 
only different, but they are dangerous. 
This is not only false; it is the same 
script used in countries like China to 
silence speech they disagree with. 
Democrats would bring those same 
socialist standards to America, but 
those standards are dangerous, vague, 
and easily abused. They have no place 
here. 
Democrats’ action this week make it 
clear that the greatest threat to free 
speech today is not a law from Con-
gress, which is bound by the First 
Amendment. The greatest threat is 
politicians who bully private compa-
nies to silence dissenting views. 
The sad part is it isn’t only Demo-
crats who have done this. They sent a 
letter to a company of Amazon that 
was created to sell books, to tell them 
not to sell books. 
Lastly, beyond these serious threats 
to free speech, the irony of Democrats’ 
actions this week should not be lost on 
us. For the last 4 years, we were told 
that the greatest danger to free speech 
was President Trump. 
To underscore this accusation, the 
liberal legacy newspaper in Washington 
adopted its first official slogan: ‘‘De-
mocracy dies in darkness.’’ 
As usual, the heated rhetoric from 
the other side was off base—badly. The 
same party that is now worried about 
misinformation rumor mills and con-
spiracy 
theory 
hotbeds 
was 
com-
fortable with endorsing destructive and 
false narratives for 4 years. 
Back 
in 
August, 
Congresswoman 
ESHOO
herself basically alleged that 
the Trump administration was inten-
tionally attacking the U.S. Postal 
Service. She called it election theft 
and a campaign of sabotage. 
How 
about 
Congressman 
ADAM 
SCHIFF? For years, he said he had more 
than circumstantial evidence of Rus-
sian collusion. We all found that to be 
false. 
Nevertheless, 
networks 
like 
‘‘MSNBC’’ continue to perpetuate the 
baseless accusation. I wonder if they 
sent a letter there. 
Or how about our own Speaker 
PELOSI, who said in 2017, ‘‘Our election 
was hijacked. There is no question.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
are capable of making decisions about 
how best to live their lives. They de-
serve to decide how to take care of 
their families or open their businesses 
during a pandemic. And they deserve to 
decide to watch the news, judge the in-
formation they choose, and draw their 
own conclusions about its accuracy. 
They need us to trust them, not to try 
to control them. 
If Democrats accepted robust debate, 
they would find that more people 
would trust Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a body that is 
using its power to try to determine

what books can be printed, what shows 
can be seen, and what can be said. 
Mr. Speaker, we have debated on this 
floor the things that happen in China. 
And in China, if you try to buy an air-
line ticket you could have the money, 
but they have an app there. And they 
say, first, we have to check. 
They have had people in their own 
press that were told: I am sorry, you 
can’t take the plane. 
Why? 
You have said something that gov-
ernment 
doesn’t 
like. 
You 
should 
apologize. 
The reporter apologized but the gov-
ernment thought it wasn’t sincere 
enough. 
To me, it is something I would fight 
because I believe in free speech. 
I thought that was farfetched in a 
faraway land. I never thought it would 
be written on paper in the U.S. Con-
gress, and the powerful members of a 
committee that oversees jurisdiction 
would threaten people of why they 
carry a network and will they carry 
that network in the future; and if so, 
why? 
I never thought I would see Members 
of Congress use their power to threaten 
others to go against the First Amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, we will not stand for it, 
nor will the American public. This is 
not a partisan issue; this is a constitu-
tional issue.

THANKING MEMBERS OF 
NATIONAL GUARD 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
thank the citizen soldiers and airmen 
of our National Guard for upholding 
their oath to the Constitution. 
Just 1 week after the attack on our 
Capitol, the inauguration of President 
Joe Biden and Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS was peaceful. That is thanks to 
the 26,700 National Guardsmen and 
-women who answered our Nation’s call 
to serve at this moment of need. 
Their motto is ‘‘Always Ready, Al-
ways There.’’ During the past month, 
their actions have fully embodied that 
motto. 
Like Lieutenant Colonel John Bryk, 
who juggles his commitment to our Na-
tion with his commitment to the stu-
dents he serves in Orland Park School 
District in my home State of Illinois, 
he is one of more than nearly 1,000 Illi-
nois Guardsmen and -women who have 
been deployed to Washington. There 
are still 500 here right now. 
I met with some of them this morn-
ing. I will meet with more of them to-
morrow. Illinois’ sons and daughters, 
who have chosen to serve and protect 
this government body and this sacred 
building, we are stronger for their sac-
rifice, and I thank them for their serv-
ice. 
SUPPORTING NATIONAL RIGHT-TO- 
WORK ACT 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this week I am reintroducing 
the National Right-to-Work Act with 
over 60 original cosponsors. 
I, along with over 80 percent of the 
American people, believe that every 
worker should have the power to decide 
whether to negotiate for themselves 
with their employer. This bill would 
simply listen to the majority of Amer-
ican workers. 
South Carolina has seen firsthand 
the job creation when we protect free-
doms for American workers. I was 
present 
for 
Michelin 
Tire 
Corp.’s 
groundbreaking with Governor Jim 
Edwards to develop their largest plant 
in the world. I was with Governor Car-
roll 
Campbell 
for 
the 
BMW 
groundbreaking in Greer for their larg-
est manufacturing facility. And I was 
with Governor Nikki Haley to see the 
building of Boeing aircraft in Charles-
ton. 
Congratulations to Mark Mix, presi-
dent of the National Right to Work 
Legal Defense Foundation, for his suc-
cess in 27 States. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

EQUALITY ACT WILL BE LIFE- 
CHANGING 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Equality Act. 
As the proud sister of a trans brother 
and a gender-nonconforming sibling 
and the proud representative of Hill-
crest, the heart of San Diego’s LGBTQ- 
plus community, this bill is deeply per-
sonal. 
The protections in the Equality Act 
will be life-changing for so many of my 
constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, the first version of this 
bill was filed in 1974, 15 years before I 
was even born. It had one cosponsor 
and never got a vote. But this week, I 
am proud to say we are going to pass 
the Equality Act, cosponsored by the 
entire Democratic Caucus. 
This was made possible by all those 
who marched and protested and raised 
their voices, like San Diego’s own 
Larry Baza. Last week, we lost Larry 
to COVID, and today would have been 
his 77th birthday. Larry demanded jus-
tice and equality and dignity for all. I 
urge my colleagues to support the 
Equality Act.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY, JOE 
BERKLICH 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Joe Berklich, a World 
War II veteran and Hibbing, Minnesota, 
native, who is celebrating his 100th 
birthday today. 
In 1943, Joe enlisted in the Army and 
courageously served in the Pacific the-
ater until the end of the war. In fact, 
all four of the Berklich brothers were 
proud to serve during our country’s 
time of need. 
Upon returning home, Joe married 
the love of his life, Margaret. He still 
lives in the family home in Hibbing, 
Minnesota, where they raised their 
four children: Michael, Danny, Timmy, 
and Mary. Always a family man, Joe’s 
favorite memories are spending the 
Fourth of July at their cabin on Bear 
Lake and spoiling his grandchildren on 
Christmas Eve. 
After the war, Joe worked for U.S. 
Steel, the Sherman Mine, and Minntac 
in Mountain Iron. He became a fore-
man and also traveled the Nation 
working with vendors of mining equip-
ment. 
In his free time, Joe has been an ac-
tive member of the Hibbing commu-
nity, serving as a Hibbing city coun-
cilor to the president of the Hibbing 
Curling Club. 
Mr. Speaker, members of the Great-
est Generation like Joe Berklich are 
the pride of our communities. As the 
Hibbing community gathers today for a 
drive-by past his house to celebrate 
this major milestone, I am proud to 
stand here on the House floor to thank 
Joe for his service and wish him the 
happiest of birthdays.

COMMENDING COLD CHAIN 
TECHNOLOGIES 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of President 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan, a crit-
ical tool in the race between vaccines 
and variants. 
My district is home to global leaders 
in the life sciences who are helping to 
win this race. Last week, I visited one 
of them in Franklin, Massachusetts. 
Cold Chain Technologies is at the 
cutting edge of materials science, pro-
ducing insulated packaging to trans-
port and store vaccines and other bio-
logics. They package all of Moderna’s 
vaccines on the critical path of getting 
shots into arms. 
To defeat this pandemic and prevent 
another, we must enact the American 
Rescue Plan and unlock its investment 
in life sciences research, development, 
and manufacturing here in the United 
States. My district is an exemplar of 
the innovation and jobs that are the 
fruits of the life sciences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H601 
February 24, 2021 
RECOGNIZING ROBBY SNELTZER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and thank Robby Sneltzer of Venango 
County, Pennsylvania. 
Robby is a 9-year-old Oil City resi-
dent with a kind heart. This holiday 
season, Robby decided to help his 
neighbors in need by starting a dona-
tion drive. 
With the help of his stepmother, 
Angel, Robby began to collect dona-
tions of toiletries, snacks, ponchos, 
hats, 
and 
hand 
sanitizer, 
stuffing 
backpacks full of these much-needed 
items for those in need. 
Robby’s relatives pitched in with do-
nations, as well as Hasson Heights Ele-
mentary School and Hope Pediatrics. 
The backpacks were donated to The 
Pointe. The Pointe is a drop-in center 
promoting recovery and community 
awareness for individuals who struggle 
with mental health difficulties. 
Angela Proper, executive director of 
The 
Pointe, 
said: 
‘‘When 
Robby 
brought them in and we piled them up, 
it was pretty amazing.’’ 
I would like to personally thank 
Robby for his support of his commu-
nity. Acts of kindness like these make 
our world a better place.

CELEBRATING NEW SHIPPING 
ROUTE TO IRELAND 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, as we 
emerge from the darkest months of the 
COVID–19 pandemic and some pretty 
brutal weather, I rise today to offer 
some good news and to celebrate a de-
velopment that is bringing jobs and 
economic development to my district, 
along with a renewed connection to our 
shared heritage with the island of Ire-
land. 
Since the founding of our country, 
the 
Philadelphia 
region 
has 
been 
known for some of the best ports and 
shipyards in America. Also since that 
time, our area has been home to one of 
the largest groups of native Irish and 
their descendants in North America. 
Fully 20 percent of the people in my 
congressional district claim Irish her-
itage, including myself. 
Over the years, this robust commu-
nity has developed strong relationships 
with Irish educational, cultural, and 
business 
institutions, 
including 
through the Irish American Business 
Chamber & Network. 
Therefore, I am very proud and ex-
cited to celebrate the new weekly ship-
ping route between the Port of Chester 
in Delaware County and Cork, Ireland, 
which will expand our region’s leader-
ship as an entryway to America. In ad-
dition to bringing critical medical, 
pharmaceutical, food, and raw material 
supplies to the East Coast, the shipping 
route is supporting good-paying jobs 
and a long-hoped-for renaissance in 
Chester’s riverfront economy, which 
can be an economic driver for our en-
tire region. 
I am excited to continue working 
with my colleagues in the Friends of 
Ireland Caucus and to increase our ties 
with Ireland, grow our economy, and 
create good-paying jobs. 
f 
COMMENDING TED McKINNEY 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to commend the work of Under 
Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and 
Foreign 
Agricultural 
Affairs 
Ted 
McKinney. Ted is the first person to 
hold this position, and he set a high 
bar for whoever succeeds him. 
His work has been an integral part of 
shaping trade agreements, including 
the successful renegotiation of the 
NAFTA into the USMCA. His deter-
mination to help American farmers get 
their products to new markets has not 
only helped our American farmers but 
has helped feed the world. 
Ted’s remarkable passion for agri-
culture began at an early age, growing 
up on a farm in Tipton, Indiana, and 
was active in 4–H and with the Future 
Farmers of America organization. He 
then graduated from Purdue University 
with a B.A. in agricultural economics 
and later served as the director of the 
Indiana State Department of Agri-
culture. 
Thank you, Ted, for your outstanding 
work and devotion to our Nation’s 
farmers. 
f 
RECOGNIZING WJBE AS A 
KNOXVILLE MEDIA CORNERSTONE 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, Feb-
ruary is Black History Month, as we all 
know. Today, I rise to recognize WJBE, 
Knoxville’s only Black-owned radio 
station and a media cornerstone in our 
community. 
WJBE was originally founded by the 
godfather of soul, James Brown, and 
WJBE actually stood for, back then, 
James Brown Enterprises. It was reor-
ganized in 2013, thanks to the efforts of 
my good friend and former colleague in 
the Tennessee General Assembly, Joe 
Armstrong, along with his partner and 
station manager, Gene Thomas, Jr. 
WJBE has grown into a unique home 
for Knoxville’s Black voices. On WJBE, 
musicians showcase their talents, busi-
ness owners promote their services, 
and public officials share how the lat-
est policies impact the people they rep-
resent, and that is me included. 
Thanks to this station, the successes 
and stories of the local Black commu-
nity are heard year-round, not just 
during Black History Month. 
WJBE is an invaluable part of east 
Tennessee’s culture, Mr. Speaker, and I 
am proud to share the station’s story 
here on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
f 
JESSIE CLEMENTE CELEBRATES 
103 YEARS 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of an inspiring woman 
in my community, Jessie Clemente. 
Jessie will be celebrating her 103rd 
birthday on Thursday with her family. 
Born and raised in Utica, New York, 
Jessie has committed her life to being 
a loving wife, mother, grandmother, 
and great-grandmother. She enjoys 
spending time with her family, espe-
cially her beloved 5-month-old great- 
granddaughter, who she enjoys cooking 
and baking with. Jessie is also incred-
ibly proud of her great-nephew David, 
who is serving our Nation in the U.S. 
Army. 
The Clemente family has been a pil-
lar of the Utica community for many 
generations. They own and operate 
Clemente Novelties, where Jessie often 
helped with day-to-day tasks and sup-
ported her son, who is currently run-
ning the family business. 
I want to wish Jessie a very happy 
birthday and a safe and healthy year. 
Her zest for life and love of her family 
are an inspiration to all of us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H603 
February 24, 2021 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
and my colleague from the Common-
wealth 
of 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 147, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 5, 
the Equality Act, under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 90 minutes of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary and one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 803, the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act, 
under a structured rule. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing member of the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources and self-executes a 
manager’s amendment from Chairman 
GRIJALVA. It also makes in order 29 
amendments, provides en bloc author-
ity to Chairman GRIJALVA, and pro-
vides one motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to de-
bate the rule for two critical pieces of 
legislation, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, 
and H.R. 803, the Protecting America’s 
Wilderness and Public Lands Act. 
This is a historic day for Congress 
and for equal rights. Over 45 years ago, 
Congresswoman 
Bella 
Abzug 
intro-
duced the first version of the Equality 
Act, a bill that will provide full legal 
protections to LGBTQ people all across 
our country by extending the protec-
tions of the Civil Rights Act to them 
and making clear that we must re-
spect, defend, and celebrate the dignity 
innate of everyone in our communities, 
including—and 
perhaps 
especially— 
those who are perceived as different or 
non-binary. 
The version of the Equality Act that 
we consider today is the result of years 
of 
careful 
legislative drafting and 
amends existing civil rights laws to 
provide protection from discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity in key areas of public life: em-
ployment, housing, credit, education, 
public spaces and services, federally 
funded programs, and jury service. 
Additionally, the Equality Act up-
dates the public spaces and services 
covered in current law to include retail 
stores and services, such as banks, 
legal 
services, 
and 
transportation. 
These 
important 
updates 
would 
strengthen existing protections for ev-
eryone. 
The journey to this final version of 
the Equality Act was led by a dear col-
league who is a historymaker in his 
own right, co-chair of the LGBTQ 
Equality Caucus and my colleague on 
the Judiciary Committee, Congress-
man DAVID CICILLINE of Rhode Island. 
Congressman CICILLINE
worked with 
lawyers and advocates from the left 
and the right, religious groups, and a 
host of civil rights groups to make sure 
the language of the Equality Act 
achieved full legal equality while pro-
tecting existing civil rights for other 
marginalized groups. 
The resulting bill is supported by 130 
of the largest employees in the coun-
try, our largest labor unions, and the 
hundreds of organizations including, to 
name just a few, the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights, the 
NAACP, the National Women’s Law 
Center, the Episcopal Church, the 
Union for Reform Judaism, and the 
United Church of Christ. 
And, most importantly, it is sup-
ported by a clear and overwhelming 
majority of the American people. Sev-
enty-one percent of Americans support 
this legislation, including majorities of 
Democrats, Independents, and Repub-
licans. 
The clear majority of both the House 
and the American people recognize 
that for too long LGBTQ people have 
faced discrimination with no Federal 
legal recourse. It is beyond dispute 
that 
LGBTQ 
people—especially 
transgender people and, even more so, 
transgender women of color—face dis-
crimination across this country. 
To echo other speakers, this issue is 
deeply personal for me. It has been per-
sonal since my baby sister came out to 
me almost 40 years ago. For many peo-
ple all across this country and across 
this House, that is when this fight hits 
home. 
It gets personal when someone whom 
you love says: This is who I am. 
It gets personal when you know and 
value that person and you want to do 
whatever you can to make sure that 
your loved one can live their life to the 
fullest, free from hate and discrimina-
tion. 
I am sad to say that my home, Penn-
sylvania, is one of the 30 States that 
defies the will of its people by not hav-
ing legal protections for LGBTQ peo-
ple. The idea that my sister—someone 
who put her life on the line for our 
country when she served in our Armed 
Forces—could drive across State lines 
and lose protections is heartbreaking. 
The Equality Act ends the patchwork 
of State laws and creates uniform, na-
tionwide protections. LGBTQ people 
won’t have to worry that being trans-
ferred to another State by their em-
ployer or needing to move home to 
take care of ailing parents will cause 
them to lose civil rights protections. 
From sea to shining sea, LGBTQ people 
will have the security and stability 
that comes from knowing that, if they 
face discrimination, they have legal re-
course. 
It is also important to note what the 
Equality Act does not do. The Equality 
Act does not impinge on religious free-
dom. Religious liberty is a cornerstone 
value of our Constitution and our coun-
try. Religious organizations are cur-
rently able to prefer their own mem-
bers and their version of morality in 
hiring for religious positions, such as 
ministers 
and 
schoolteachers. 
The 
Equality Act does nothing to change 
that. The Equality Act does not force 
anyone to perform or obtain abortions 
in violation of their religious beliefs, 
and it does not strip girls of their title 
9 protections. 
The Equality Act does clarify what 
has long been held: That religious free-
dom laws do not create an exemption 
to civil rights laws. 
b 1345 
Just like a person can’t use a claim 
of religious freedom to refuse to sell a 
house to an interracial couple, under 
the Equality Act LGBTQ families will 
be protected from discrimination re-
gardless of its motivation. 
Consider the stakes facing LGBTQ 
people too often all across this coun-
try. A same-sex couple walks into a 
restaurant. Having hired a babysitter 
to look after their young children, they 
are hoping to have a relaxing night 
out. But, instead, when they are seated 
and looking at the menu, the manager 
comes over and tells them that they 
have to leave. They aren’t welcome. 
This kind of insecurity and humilia-
tion occurs on a daily basis across this 
country, and in 30 States the couple 
would have no legal recourse. Often, 
humiliation is just the tip of the ice-
berg. Same-sex couples are far more 
likely to be denied housing; qualified 
and high-performing transgender peo-
ple are more likely to be fired from 
their jobs; and LGBTQ young people 
face rejection and discrimination in 
school, which can deny them an edu-
cation. 
These injuries compound and lead to 
poverty, homelessness, and violence. 
The impact is felt the hardest by 
transgender women of color, who con-
front racial discrimination, sex dis-
crimination, and gender identity dis-
crimination. The intersection of these 
forms of discrimination is all too often 
deadly. 
The protections provided by the 
Equality Act give LGBTQ people an 
equal chance at the American Dream. 
While discrimination and rejection has 
ended 
the 
lives 
of 
too 
many 
transgender people, many are suc-
ceeding despite discrimination. 
We are talking here about the civil 
rights of our friends, our family, and 
public servants. In Pennsylvania, Dr. 
Rachel Levine, a transgender woman, 
served in the Governor’s cabinet as 
Secretary for Health, and has recently 
been nominated by President Biden to 
serve as Assistant Health Secretary. 
Mara Keisling, a Pennsylvania na-
tive, is the founder and Executive Di-
rector of the National Center for

Transgender Equality and a pioneer for 
civil rights protections. 
Sarah McBride was recently sworn in 
as the first transgender Senator in the 
State of Delaware. 
And of course, Pete Buttigieg was re-
cently sworn in as the U.S. Secretary 
of Transportation, becoming the first 
openly gay cabinet member to be con-
firmed by the Senate. 
Opponents of the Equality Act keep 
trying to pit cisgender girls against 
transgender girls, when really this leg-
islation is about strengthening oppor-
tunity for all girls and women. Wheth-
er it is women’s sports, single-sex col-
leges, or homeless services for women, 
the Equality Act simply prohibits dis-
crimination on the basis of sexual ori-
entation and gender identity in these 
areas. It doesn’t undermine these insti-
tutions or prohibit them; it simply en-
sures that they are inclusive of all 
women 
and 
girls, 
including 
trans 
women and girls. 
Support for this legislation is over-
whelming and deserves an overwhelm-
ingly positive response from this body. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port the rule and underlying legisla-
tion, and further encourage the Senate 
to swiftly act to pass this bill so that 
we can finally provide firm, statutory 
protections to the LGBTQ community. 
Next, Mr. Speaker, is H.R. 803, the 
Protecting America’s Wilderness and 
Public Lands Act. This is a package of 
public bills from the Natural Resources 
Committee that will designate more 
than 1.5 million acres as wilderness 
areas, and more than 1,200 river miles 
into the National Wild and Scenic Riv-
ers System. 
The bill would also withdraw more 
than 1.2 million acres of public land 
from new drilling and mining, ensuring 
that iconic landscapes like the Grand 
Canyon and Colorado’s Thompson Di-
vide are permanently protected for fu-
ture generations to enjoy. 
Few things in the United States are 
as universally cherished by Americans 
as are our public lands. Our country is 
home to more than 111 million acres of 
designated wilderness, and these lands 
help us combat climate change, provide 
for an array of ecological diversity, and 
offer recreational activities to Ameri-
cans young and old. 
As we continue to endure the dev-
astating effects of climate change, pro-
viding for millions of additional acres 
of wilderness will allow for these areas 
to continue to serve as critical ‘‘carbon 
sinks’’ to capture and mitigate carbon 
dioxide in our atmosphere. 
A similar version of this legislation 
passed the House last Congress, but 
this version includes a critical new 
piece from Natural Resources Com-
mittee Chairman GRIJALVA, the Grand 
Canyon Protection Act. This bill would 
permanently ban new mining claims on 
approximately one million acres of 
public land surrounding Grand Canyon 
National Park, while helping to protect 
the clean water resources critical to 
the livelihoods of local Tribal commu-
nities. 
The Grand Canyon Protection Act 
was developed by Chairman GRIJALVA 
in close consultation with all of the 
relevant stakeholders in his district 
and serves to protect one of the most 
cherished places in the United States. 
You may hear my colleague from 
Pennsylvania argue that this bill is 
nothing but a land grab, an attempt to 
subvert private industry. Of course, 
this couldn’t be farther from the truth. 
Mining, like every other industry, is 
subject to the whim of the free market. 
Historically, when the demand for 
these minerals has dropped, mining 
companies are all too prepared to skip 
town without cleaning up any of their 
mess. 
This bill isn’t about whether or not 
nuclear energy and its inputs will be 
part of our clean energy future, but if 
we want to ensure that it is, then I 
would recommend that we first start 
by supporting effective regulations on 
new and existing nuclear plants and 
their capabilities. The best way to en-
sure demand for a product is to simi-
larly ensure that its user won’t decide 
it 
isn’t 
worth 
pursuing 
or 
is 
unaffordable. 
The merits of nuclear energy aside, 
you can’t deny that its use in this 
country is on the downswing or, at the 
very least, stagnant. This isn’t due to 
over-regulation; it is due to under-reg-
ulation. It is due to massive cost over-
runs 
and 
incompetent 
government 
oversight. 
The U.S. has had only one new nu-
clear reactor become operational in the 
last 20 years. This isn’t because a min-
ing company or two hasn’t been af-
forded the opportunity to desecrate our 
national resources, but because the 
U.S. has not yet proven we can respon-
sibly operate a nuclear plant that, 
from start to finish, is safe and has the 
trust of the American people. 
Public lands do not belong to those 
only in the Congressional district in 
which they are located; they belong to 
all of us. Wilderness areas in the great 
State of Colorado belong to you and me 
as much as Independence Hall belongs 
to a native of Colorado. We all have a 
role to play in protecting these lands 
and seeking carveouts for mining com-
panies is not the right way forward. 
I want to especially thank my col-
league, 
Congresswoman 
DIANA 
DEGETTE, for her tireless and bipar-
tisan work in getting this legislation 
to such a great place. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I thank the distinguished gentle-
woman from my home State of Penn-
sylvania for yielding me the customary 
30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us pro-
vides for the consideration of two 
pieces of legislation. Let’s just look at 
both pieces one at a time. 
The first bill, H.R. 5, the Equality 
Act, provides for civil rights protec-
tions 
for 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer individuals. 
Let me start by saying that Repub-
licans believe all people should be 
treated equally under the law. Let me 
repeat that. Republicans believe all 
people should be treated equally under 
the law. But the Equality Act misses 
that mark. 
Rather, H.R. 5 represents a radical 
departure from existing civil rights 
protections that will have significant 
implications on everyday life, and 
eliminate laws ensuring women and 
girls have the same opportunities as 
men and boys. 
Just take student athletics. H.R. 5 
would redefine sex to include gender 
identity, 
meaning 
a 
transgender 
woman, a person who was born geneti-
cally male but identifies as a woman, 
could not be barred from participating 
in girls’ or women’s athletics. 
Further, I have concerns that, due to 
the lack of committee action, this bill 
has not been fully thought out and it 
may be difficult, frankly, if not impos-
sible, to actually implement in line 
with congressional intent. 
Perhaps the most pressing example of 
this is the term ‘‘gender identity,’’ 
which is so vague that even the special 
interest groups backing this bill can-
not agree on a single definition of that. 
Lastly, I am troubled that the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act is not 
applicable under this measure. Without 
this vital protection, churches, syna-
gogues, mosques, and religiously affili-
ated schools will be forced to act con-
trary to their deeply held beliefs or 
stop offering certain services to the 
public. 
Religious freedom was once an issue 
that all Americans, regardless of polit-
ical party, strongly supported. It is in-
credibly disappointing to see my col-
leagues across the aisle abandon this 
principle in an effort to appease their 
far-left radical progressive base. 
Mr. Speaker, the second part of this 
rule provides for consideration of H.R. 
803, the Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness and Public Lands Act. This legis-
lation consists of 8 natural resources 
bills, and will create nearly 1.5 million 
acres of wilderness, establish the most 
restrictive Federal land use classifica-
tion, as well as lock up rivers and other 
lands across four western States. 
Like all my Republican colleagues, I 
strongly support responsible preserva-
tion of our Nation’s natural resources. 
Remember, it was Republican Teddy 
Roosevelt who started this movement. 
However, my colleagues across the 
aisle have ignored this and have gone 
way too far. This bill takes a partisan 
approach to public land protection, and 
not a single Republican has cospon-
sored the underlying measures. 
Further, some of the lands affected 
by this legislation lie in congressional 
districts where Members of Congress do 
not support such actions. These Mem-
bers have not had the opportunity to 
share their opposition or their con-
cerns, as bills in H.R. 803 were not 
marked up by this Congress.

H.R. 803 also ignores input from local 
communities, who voiced concern that 
these measures will hurt local econo-
mies and rural jobs. As we recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic, the last thing 
that we should be doing is eliminating 
good-paying, family-sustaining jobs. 
Further, this bill will actually in-
crease catastrophic wildfires, as the 
new wilderness and scenic river des-
ignations 
prohibit 
scientific 
forest 
management. 
I am especially concerned that this 
measure withdraws 1.2 million acres 
from mineral production, including 
uranium, a necessary component for 
the U.S. nuclear reactor fleet. 
Currently, our Nation is relying on 
China for the vast majority of rare 
earth elements and critical materials, 
which are necessary for everything 
from building a fighter jet to a cell 
phone. 
Just last week, we saw China threat-
en to cut off its mineral supply to 
American defense contractors. We have 
watched as China has done this to sis-
ter democracies such as Japan. 
This bill will give the Chinese Com-
munist Party, and other unstable and 
hostile regimes, control over our en-
ergy and mineral needs, putting our 
economic and national security at risk. 
We must not cut off access to the 
minerals and materials necessary for 
everyday life and for the protection of 
our Nation. 
I would urge my colleagues across 
the aisle to seek a bipartisan approach 
to these two bills, to this rule, not just 
today, but also in the weeks and 
months ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the distin-
guished chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania, a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee, for yielding me the 
time; and I want to thank her for her 
eloquent opening. 
Mr. Speaker, we are just weeks away 
from the 53rd anniversary of Martin 
Luther King, Jr.’s famous speech at the 
National Cathedral. That is when he 
uttered the powerful line, ‘‘The moral 
arc of the universe is long, but it bends 
towards justice.’’ 
In many ways, those words are as 
misconstrued as they are well-known, 
because some have taken them to mean 
that if you just wait long enough, jus-
tice is inevitable. Dr. King knew bet-
ter, though. He knew that for the 
moral arc to bend, people needed to be 
courageous enough to actually bend it. 
Just 6 years after this line was spo-
ken, Members of this Chamber showed 
that courage when they introduced the 
original Equality Act. They did so in 
the shadow of the Stonewall riots, at a 
time when even discussing LGBTQ 
issues publicly was seen by many as 
taboo. 
These Members recognized the funda-
mental unfairness in a patchwork of 
State laws being used to deny some 
Americans fundamental rights like 
jobs and homes, just because of who 
they were or who they loved. 
b 1400 
They had the backbone to act, giving 
a voice in these hallowed Halls to the 
many advocates nationwide fighting 
for equality from the outside. 
Getting to this point has been a long, 
long, long road, and I am a proud co-
sponsor of the Equality Act that is be-
fore us today, and I have pushed for 
this day for a long time. I know this 
hasn’t been easy. So many people and 
so many organizations, though, never 
wavered. And along the way, they 
changed hearts and minds on this 
issue. 
What may have been a radical idea 
then is not now. In fact, most people 
today not only support such protec-
tions for LGBTQ Americans, they in-
correctly believe that they are already 
in place. That is how common sense 
this bill is, Mr. Speaker. 
This House made history when it 
passed the Equality Act for the first 
time last Congress, and we did so in a 
bipartisan 
way. 
Unfortunately, 
it 
didn’t even get a vote in the Repub-
lican-controlled Senate, and the prior 
Republican President didn’t support it. 
But now we have new leadership in the 
Senate and a President who has made 
passing this bill a top priority. 
This moment represents our best 
chance yet to finally make the Equal-
ity Act the law of the land. This mo-
ment, Mr. Speaker, is an opportunity 
to bend the moral arc toward justice, 
toward fairness, and toward equality, 
and I encourage all of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to seize it. 
Let’s support this rule and the under-
lying bill, and let’s take a historic step 
forward toward building a more fair 
and just society for all Americans. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), my 
good friend. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this rule. 
The underlying legislation we are 
considering in this rule is wrought 
with concerning provisions. One under-
lying bill, H.R. 803, is just another land 
grab that will kill jobs, make our Na-
tion hostage to hostile foreign powers, 
restrict public access and recreation 
opportunities on our public lands, and 
threaten our energy independence. 
Specifically, in my home State of Ar-
izona, this bill has dangerous implica-
tions for our mining industry. These 
provisions also threaten our national 
security by making the United States 
reliant on foreign nations for critical 
minerals. 
The other bill in this rule, the so- 
called Equality Act, is anything but 
equal. In fact, it is a threat to women’s 
privacy and safety. This bill effectively 
outlaws facilities reserved for biologi-
cal females. This includes restrooms, 
showers, and locker rooms. And out-
rageously, this also includes women’s 
domestic violence shelters. 
As a survivor myself of domestic vio-
lence, I know the importance of these 
women’s shelters. They are critical for 
women who are trying to escape do-
mestic violence and sometimes sexual 
assault. Under this Equality Act, a 
man, a biological man, identifying as a 
woman cannot legally be turned away 
from any of these facilities. 
Women will lose all rights to bodily 
privacy, safety, and security. Vulner-
able women across America deserve 
better, Mr. Speaker. 
In addition, this bill will end girls 
sports as we know it by mandating 
schools accept males into girls sports. 
I stand in opposition to both of the 
underlying bills, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just note for the record that over 20 
States already have versions of this 
law, the Equality Act, with respect to 
participation in sports, as do the Olym-
pics, and we have not seen the kind of 
behavior that has just been suggested. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s courtesy 
and her careful, thoughtful explanation 
of what we are doing. 
I strongly support the Equality Act, 
extending civil rights protections to all 
citizens. I have been honored to be a 
part of this process throughout my po-
litical career, dating back as a child 
legislator in the 1970s in county gov-
ernment, in city government in Or-
egon, and for the last 25 years here in 
Congress. 
The arguments that we are hearing 
have been heard before. The same sort 
of hysterical concerns have proven not 
to be the case. Wild claims have been 
proven wrong; and especially I think of 
marriage equality as the most compel-
ling. Each reform, each step of the 
way, has been for progress, and equal-
ity was positive, and ultimately sup-
ported by the public, as is the Equality 
Act. The wild claims have been proven 
groundless. 
At the end of the day, one of the rea-
sons is that Americans are biased in 
favor of fairness and equality. Another 
important reason, as alluded to by my 
friend from Pennsylvania, is personal 
experience. There was fear and mis-
apprehension, but as people became ex-
perienced with a family member who 
married, a transgender child, when you 
deal with the reality of real people, 
what we find is that they are people 
like everybody else, and we do not 
want their lives to be turned upside 
down. 
I come from a State where by and 
large these protections are in place, 
but they aren’t in place for everybody 
everywhere, and we have an oppor-
tunity to make additional progress. 
One of the reasons that we have seen

this progress take place is the advo-
cacy of those in the LGBT community 
who have been tireless, thoughtful, ar-
ticulate, strategic, moving the agenda 
forward and bringing along often reluc-
tant politicians. 
Last but not least, I would reference 
what happened with our young people. 
Young people understand this. Young 
people are not hysterical. Young people 
express their concern and willingness 
to embrace others, regardless of sexual 
orientation, and that is why ultimately 
this cause will win. It is why so much 
progress has been made and why it will 
ultimately be successful. 
I 
deeply 
appreciate 
this 
being 
brought before us, an opportunity for 
us to approve the Equality Act, affirm 
the bedrock principle of full equality, 
move it on to the Senate, and hopefully 
now with an administration committed 
to equality, we can enact it into law 
for the benefit of citizens all across the 
country. 
I just have one 30-second evaluation 
of the notion of scientific forest man-
agement. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Oregon. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
will just say, I come from an area 
where so-called ‘‘scientific manage-
ment’’ of forests has resulted in more 
forest fires, problems with water qual-
ity, problems with habitat. We are 
learning that we need to make dif-
ferent changes, and one of the tools 
that we have is extending wilderness 
protection. It strengthens the environ-
ment, 
protects 
wildlife, 
water 
re-
sources, and makes them more resil-
ient, not less. 
It is not a matter of raking the for-
ests, as Donald Trump said, but having 
an opportunity to allow the healing 
power of nature to provide those pro-
tections. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
in their continued relentless assault on 
religious freedoms, Democrats are try-
ing today, with this terrible bill, to 
make wholesale and damaging changes 
to our Nation’s civil rights laws with 
little to no debate or even discussion 
on how this legislation will affect the 
daily lives of Americans and the insti-
tutions we hold dear. 
While the Equality Act purports to 
be an inclusive piece of legislation, it 
is actually exclusive of those with a 
different viewpoint. It would ulti-
mately put civil rights laws at odds 
with longstanding religious beliefs per-
taining to sex, sexuality, and other 
moral issues. 
The result would be that faith-based 
nonprofits, such as a Christian shelter 
for women or an adoption agency or 
other religiously affiliated providers of 
social services, could not minister in 
good conscience without suffering con-
sequences under Federal law. 
We have past history as a precedent, 
an ominous precedent, as we saw the 
Obama-Biden administration seek to 
close down the Little Sisters of the 
Poor and Catholic nuns who care for 
the dying simply because they would 
not pay for their employees’ contracep-
tion or drugs inducing abortion. 
A vote for the Equality Act would so-
lidify 
the 
Biden-Harris 
administra-
tion’s efforts to enforce the same rad-
ical religious and moral litmus tests 
that leave no room for faith-based min-
istries and organizations to operate 
without subscribing to the dogma of 
the left. 
The 
Equality 
Act 
essentially 
weaponizes civil rights laws against 
Americans’ fundamental liberties, and 
we must reject this assault on our 
most precious of freedoms. I oppose 
this rule, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just restate that this act does not take 
away any of the religious freedoms 
that are already enshrined in multiple 
laws. It does not change those laws. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, in the spirit of the debate here for 
the rule, there seems to be quite a dis-
agreement between each side over what 
exactly this bill says, so for a par-
liamentary question, I would like to re-
quest that the entire bill be read. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman’s request will not be enter-
tained. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Well, then, 
let’s read some of the rules. You keep 
saying it doesn’t violate religious free-
doms when, in fact, it does. It says so 
directly here in the bill in these sec-
tions, and it is a shame that we aren’t 
reading the exact text because it is the 
text that matters. It doesn’t matter 
what you have to say or what I have to 
say. It is the actual wording. 
In section 1107, it actually talks 
about: ‘‘The Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act of 1993 shall not provide a 
claim concerning, or a defense to a 
claim under, a covered title, or provide 
a basis for challenging the application 
or enforcement of a covered title.’’ 
This bill, in the text, also specifically 
talks about: ‘‘With respect to gender 
identity, an individual shall not be de-
nied access to a shared facility, includ-
ing a restroom, a locker room, and a 
dressing room, that is in accordance 
with the individual’s gender identity.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 15 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia just to 
close. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, in the wording in the text of the bill 
of the Equality Act, it also says: ‘‘With 
respect to sex, pregnancy, childbirth or 
a related medical condition shall not 
receive less favorable treatment than 
other physical conditions.’’ 
As a parliamentary question, what 
does that mean? Does that mean that 
anyone can demand an abortion? And 
it is discrimination to be refused this 
medical service? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, with re-
spect to the gentlewoman’s question, 
with respect to the language in ques-
tion, it has long been held by our 
courts that the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act does not apply to civil 
rights laws. 
The Equality Act looks to treat dis-
crimination against LGBTQ individ-
uals the same way as other forms of 
discrimination, including racial dis-
crimination. So, these arguments just 
don’t hold water. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from the great State of Texas (Mr. 
PFLUGER). 
b 1415 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to both bills. However, I am 
here to talk about the partisan Federal 
land grab package. 
Last week, my home State of Texas 
endured a harrowing winter storm that 
wiped out electricity and water for mil-
lions of Texans. It devastated homes 
and businesses and caused irreparable 
damage to livestock, crops, and indus-
try production across the State. Trag-
ically, some even lost their lives. 
Our State was under an extreme 
emergency. Living through that under-
scored the need for safe, affordable, re-
liable energy. We absolutely must have 
a reliable baseload for our energy grids 
and a level playing field for all forms of 
energy. The Federal Government can-
not pick favorites in energy. 
What 
happened 
in 
Texas 
should 
shake our country into the realization 
that, as our population grows and our 
energy needs expand, any move to 
limit production will have dire con-
sequences on our safety and our na-
tional security. 
Unfortunately, this bill is another 
step in the vendetta to limit the Amer-
ican energy production. The partisan 
$1.2 million Federal land grab—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 15 seconds to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, the land 
grab is another Democrat attempt to 
restrict our country’s abundant nat-
ural resources under onerous regula-
tions that will kill jobs in the energy 
industry and put Americans at risk. 
This is a matter of national security, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote 
against this bill and to vote for the

safety and energy independence that 
this country so deserves. Please join 
me in voting ‘‘no’’ for both bills and 
both rules. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just note that what we saw in Texas 
this past week was a truly astonishing, 
unusual snowstorm with frigid cold 
conditions that are not normal—as the 
Speaker knows—in Texas, and that 
happens because of climate change. 
Because we haven’t done enough to 
protect our wilderness and to protect 
our environment, we end up with ex-
treme climate events like we just saw, 
and this bill is a step toward redressing 
that imbalance. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act. 
I will do this to ensure that the $54.3 
billion that Congress appropriated just 
last month to help schools reopen is, in 
fact, prioritized to meet the expenses 
of actually being able to open up 
schools for in-person learning. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include in the RECORD the text 
of my amendment, along with any ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), who 
will explain the amendment. 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose 
the previous question. This is the third 
time here today that Republicans have 
called on this body to consider my bill, 
the Reopen Schools Act. It is a com-
monsense solution to get students and 
teachers to return to the classroom 
and to do it safely. 
This legislation would condition a 
portion of State COVID relief grants 
for education on schools actually re-
opening. My Democrat colleagues al-
ready voted for these funds to be used 
specifically for schools to reopen safely 
back in December, $54 billion. 
The science on this is definitive. If 
certain safety precautions are taken, 
teachers and students can resume in- 
person learning safely. So that is why 
Congress sent the States this money 
back in December. 
But after nearly a year of this pan-
demic lockdown, millions of students 
are still learning exclusively from be-
hind a screen. Our children are strug-
gling academically and they are falling 
behind. 
But the toll on mental health is what 
is most concerning to me. Even after a 
year, many kids haven’t seen their 
school friends. They haven’t been out 
to play on a playground. They are iso-
lated, disconnected, and they are lone-
ly. From increased stress and anxiety, 
depression, even suicidal thoughts or 
attempts, our youngest generation is 
facing a mental health crisis. 
Hospitals have seen a staggering in-
crease in mental health emergencies 
among young children. It is heart-
breaking. And the longer the goal posts 
continue to be moved on reopening 
schools, the worse this mental health 
crisis for our young people will become. 
My home State of Iowa is leading the 
way to put students’ education and 
mental health first. My two sons got 
on the school bus this morning in Iowa. 
They are in class right now receiving 
hands-on attention from their teach-
ers, and they will play with their 
friends at recess today. 
As a parent, I am grateful that I had 
the ability to make the right choice for 
my children and send them back to 
class to learn in person. But millions of 
parents around the country have not 
been given this choice, with many 
school districts still only offering vir-
tual learning. I have heard of so many 
families who are struggling as schools 
remain shuttered and they have no 
clear timetable for reopening. 
It is vulnerable families with at-risk 
children who are impacted the most by 
these decisions. Let’s think about the 
kids who don’t have access to a com-
puter or WiFi to try to complete their 
lessons online. Or let’s talk about the 
kids who rely on school breakfast and 
lunch and they are going hungry with-
out these vital nutrition programs. Or 
what about the victims of child abuse 
and neglect who are locked in with po-
tential abusers. Or kids who are left at 
home all day because their parents 
have no choice but to go to work. 
We cannot allow children and fami-
lies to continue to suffer right now. It 
is time for students to get back into 
the classroom, and we can do it safely. 
With the Reopen Schools Act, they will 
be able to do so safely. Teachers will be 
back in the classroom safely, and we 
can get this country moving forward 
again. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle will join me in 
supporting our students by defeating 
the previous question. We need to get 
kids back to school. So I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
30 seconds to the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN). 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I have some good news for the gentle-
woman who just spoke. The reconcili-
ation bill that is coming to the floor, 
hopefully, on Friday will have a whole 
bunch of resources in it to help States 
safely reopen schools. So I hope we will 
get a good bipartisan vote on that. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP), the good 
doctor. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the previous 
question. If the previous question is de-
feated, Republicans will amend this 
rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, 
the Reopen Schools Act, which I am 
proud to cosponsor. 
As a father of two small children, 
their overall health and well-being is 
my top priority; not just my children, 
but all of America’s children. And as I 
have looked around this Chamber, I see 
lots of Members on both sides of the 
aisle who I know to be great parents 
and grandparents, and I know they 
want the best for their children, too. 
I am also a doctor, and I am co-chair 
of our Doctors Caucus. Throughout this 
pandemic, we have heard calls from 
Members, and now from President Joe 
Biden, that we need to trust the 
science. 
As a doctor, I wholeheartedly agree— 
and the science is clear—students and 
teachers can go back to in-person 
learning safely. I know this because my 
own 
children 
have 
been 
fortunate 
enough to go back to school in person 
all of this school year safely. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
has stressed the importance of students 
returning to school for their overall 
health and well-being, and the CDC re-
search is clear that transmission in 
schools is extremely low. 
Last week, I joined Congresswoman 
HINSON, Whip SCALISE, and Ranking 
Member FOXX on a call with parents 
from all across the country who want 
their children to be able to go back to 
school. It was a bipartisan event. To 
them, this wasn’t a partisan issue. The 
parents on the call were from across 
the entire political spectrum: Repub-
licans, Democrats, and Independents. 
We heard heartbreaking stories from 
them about some of their children fall-
ing into depression, losing their read-
ing comprehension, and struggling to 
focus. 
Kids are attempting or committing 
suicide at an alarming rate. In one 
county in Nevada, the suicide rate dou-
bled from the previous year. Hospitals 
across the country are seeing unprece-
dented increases in children suicide at-
tempts and mental health admissions. 
Yes, there is some risk to returning, 
but nothing in life is zero risk. The 
consequences of staying closed are far 
too grave and our children are suf-
fering both socially and academically 
because of it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
the Reopen Schools Act because we 
have given schools the funding needed 
to 
reopen 
safely. 
However, 
some 
schools, seemingly under pressure from 
powerful teachers’ unions, refuse to re-
turn to in-person learning. 
Congress has provided more than $54 
billion in State COVID relief grants for 
education to help reopen schools. We 
didn’t, however, require the schools to 
actually reopen if they were to access 
the money, and that was a mistake. 
Congresswoman HINSON’s bill will ad-
dress that issue by conditioning those 
funds on States producing a reopening 
plan to get students back to school as 
quickly as possible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H608 
February 24, 2021 
There are at least 3 months left in 
most school years around the country. 
We can’t just let schools put off return-
ing to in-person learning until next fall 
or later. We need to do what is best for 
our students, our children, our grand-
children, our nieces and nephews. We 
need to reopen the schools now. 
We can’t, for example, expect sixth- 
grade teachers to teach fourth graders. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting to defeat the previous 
question. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
HINSON for her leadership on this bill. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would just note, as a parent, a 
former school board member, and edu-
cation advocate, of course, we all want 
what is best for our students and what 
is best for our schools. 
But I would also suggest that a one- 
size-fits-all, everybody has to go back 
in person to schools does not serve any-
body well. 
We have seen around the country— 
first of all, our schools in Pennsylvania 
are not closed. They are open. Some 
are virtual, some are hybrid, some are 
in person. But each community is 
doing what it needs to do in response 
to the conditions that are present at 
this time. 
So I agree with my colleague on the 
Rules Committee that we absolutely 
need to get our school districts and our 
State 
and 
local 
governments 
the 
money they need to safely reopen 
schools, and we are looking forward to 
doing that with our reconciliation bill 
on Friday. 
Mr. Speaker, I just inquire whether 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania is 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. I have no further speakers 
and at this time, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans believe ev-
eryone should be treated equally under 
the law. But H.R. 5 is a radical ap-
proach that will have serious, unin-
tended consequences for female ath-
letes, 
victims 
of 
sexual 
violence, 
houses of worship, and healthcare pro-
fessionals. The list goes on and on. 
Critically, the bill undermines impor-
tant religious freedom protections. 
As for H.R. 803, let’s call this what it 
is. It is a land grab. This is a land grab, 
which will kill jobs in rural commu-
nities. It will leave us vulnerable to 
hostile nations for our energy and min-
eral needs. It will restrict access and 
recreation opportunities for the Amer-
ican public. 
For all these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the underlying 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we are moving 
forward on two pieces of legislation 
whose timely consideration is long 
overdue. And I would note that H.R. 5 
did pass last Congress with a bipartisan 
majority. 
So we are looking forward, at long 
last, to passing the Equality Act 
through both Chambers and removing 
the burden of discrimination that can 
move us closer to a country where 
members of the LGBTQ community 
have an equal opportunity to achieve 
the American Dream. 
The Equality Act isn’t going to be 
the end of our long journey toward full 
LGBTQ equality, but it will bring our 
laws into line across the country with 
values that our country was founded 
upon. 
We must continually take steps to 
make our country more perfect. Ac-
knowledging in law the challenges that 
actually face LGBTQ people and taking 
concrete action to correct them brings 
us another step closer. 
Mr. Speaker, we will pass the Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness and Pub-
lic Lands Act in order to ensure that 
the sacred lands that all Americans 
share equally cannot be tarnished for 
the benefit of a few. 
We have a long way to go in address-
ing the myriad problems facing this 
country, but the two bills before us 
today are a strong and necessary start 
to helping our Nation live up to its full 
potential. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 147 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 682) to encourage local educational 
agencies to resume in-person instruction at 
elementary and secondary schools, and for 
other purposes. The first reading of the bill 
shall be dispensed with. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
General debate shall be confined to the bill 
and shall not exceed one hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. After general debate 
the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. When the committee rises and re-
ports the bill back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass, the pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except 
one motion to recommit. If the Committee 
of the Whole rises and reports that it has 
come to no resolution on the bill, then on 
the next legislative day the House shall, im-
mediately after the third daily order of busi-
ness under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into 
the Committee of the Whole for further con-
sideration of the bill. 
SEC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 682. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays

f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE 
HONORABLE RON WRIGHT 
(Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, as dean of the Texas Congres-
sional delegation, I rise to express my 
condolences on the passing of Congress-
man RON WRIGHT of Arlington. In his 
death, Congress has lost a statesman, 
Texas has lost a dedicated Representa-
tive, and I have lost a dear friend. 
Congressman WRIGHT was an ener-
getic and bright presence in our delega-
tion. He had a passion for public serv-
ice, and was willing to work with any-
one, regardless of party or politics, to 
get things done. 
He leaves behind a legacy that will 
inspire future generations of Texans to 
commit themselves to public service. 
Though his presence will certainly be 
missed, we will find comfort in know-
ing that his memory will always be 
with us. 
Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), my 
colleague and ranking member of the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today 
we gather as a grieving delegation and 
as a proud Nation to recognize the life 
and legacy of our colleague and friend, 
Congressman RON WRIGHT. 
Texas born and bred, Ron worked 
with and for the people of Texas in 
some way for the past 21 years. 
Throughout his courageous battle with 
lung cancer, his good spirits never fal-
tered, and he remained a steadfast 
champion of his conservative prin-
ciples. 
To many of us, it seemed like Ron 
never had a bad day. In fact, the last 
two bills he introduced in Congress 
protected the unborn and the sanctity 
of life, something Ron always passion-
ately supported. Think about that. As 
his life was waning, he was protecting 
the lives of the innocent unborn. 
The Texas people have lost a real 
fighter, and all of us have lost a true 
friend. Cathy and I and our entire 
Texas 
delegation 
hold 
Ron’s 
wife, 
Susan, close to our hearts, and our 
deepest condolences go out to his chil-
dren, grandchildren, and staff. 
Godspeed to you, my friend. You will 
be missed. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I ask that we all rise for a 
moment of silence. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber to rise for a 
moment of silence.

orders, veterans, military spouses, individ-
uals experiencing homelessness, individuals

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
CUBA AND OF THE EMERGENCY 
AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE 
REGULATION OF THE ANCHOR-
AGE AND MOVEMENT OF VES-
SELS—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–17) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed. 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Cuba 
that was declared on March 1, 1996, in 
Proclamation 6867, as amended by 
Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, 
Proclamation 9398 on February 24, 2016, 
and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 
2018, is to continue in effect beyond 
March 1, 2021. 
There remains a need to continue 
this national emergency, based on a 
disturbance or threatened disturbance 
of the international relations for the 
United States related to Cuba. The un-
authorized entry of any United States- 
registered vessel into Cuban territorial 
waters continues to be detrimental to 
the foreign policy of the United States. 
The unauthorized entry of vessels 
subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States into Cuban territorial 
waters is currently a violation of Fed-
eral law. Further, the unauthorized 
entry of United States-registered ves-
sels into Cuban territorial waters con-
tinues to be detrimental to United 
States foreign policy and counter to 
the purpose of Executive Order 12807, 
which is to ensure, among other things, 
safe, orderly, and legal migration. The 
possibility of large-scale unauthorized 
entries of United States-registered ves-
sels 
into 
Cuban 
territorial 
waters 
would disturb the international rela-
tions of the United States regarding 
Cuba by allowing for or providing the 
means to facilitate a mass migration of 
Cuban nationals and threatening our 
national security. 
Therefore, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency with respect to Cuba and 
the emergency authority relating to 
the regulation of the anchorage and 
movement of vessels set out in Procla-
mation 6867, as amended by Proclama-
tion 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proc-
lamation 9699.

(COVID–19) 
PANDEMIC—MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117– 
18) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and the Committee on Ways and 
Means and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Procla-
mation 9994 of March 13, 2020, begin-
ning March 1, 2020, concerning the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) 
pandemic, is to continue in effect be-
yond March 1, 2021. 
There remains a need to continue 
this national emergency. The COVID– 
19 pandemic continues to cause signifi-
cant risk to the public health and safe-
ty of the Nation. More than 500,000 peo-
ple in this Nation have perished from 
the disease, and it is essential to con-
tinue 
to 
combat 
and 
respond 
to 
COVID–19 with the full capacity and 
capability of the Federal Government. 
Therefore, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Proclamation 
9994 concerning the COVID–19 pan-
demic.

fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Precious Lord, You delight in those 
who have integrity. Lord, Your Word 
describes integrity as always trying to 
maintain a clear conscience before You 
and everyone else. Inspire our law-
makers to obey the voice of conscience, 
focusing on pleasing You by being true 
to duty. Lord, provide them with the 
determination to do what is right and 
leave the consequences to You. May 
they receive the smile of Heaven’s ap-
proval because of their striving to be 
faithful. Help them to ignore the 
shouts from the shadows and focus on 
glorifying You. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

SCHOOLS 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am 
going to talk for just a few minutes 
about the need to open our schools. I 
think you would agree with me because 
I followed your career—with admira-
tion, by the way—that our country is 
only as good as its dreams and we are 
only as valuable as our children. And, 
in my judgment, we are doing immeas-
urable damage in this country to our 
children. 
We all know that we had to close 
down our public schools and our paro-
chial schools and our private schools, 
pre-K to 12, because of the coronavirus, 
but I think most fairminded Americans 
understand that we need to open them. 
The future of this country is edu-
cation. It is not the level of the stock 
market. It is not the unemployment 
rate. It is not who the President is. It 
is education, and we know that. So why 
aren’t we opening our public schools 
when we know it is safe to do so? 
I am very proud of our efforts in Lou-
isiana. Seventy percent of our public 
school students are back learning in 
person—70 percent. And I want to 
thank every teacher, every parent, 
every school board member, every 
maintenance worker in our schools, 
and anyone who directly or indirectly 
influenced this result. They are heroes 
in my opinion. Seventy percent—I am 
so proud of that. 
I especially want to thank our teach-
ers. I have been a volunteer public 
school teacher in Louisiana for—I don’t 
know—20-plus years. I do it three times 
a year, and I am a real substitute— 
none of this go for an hour and talk 
about how a bill becomes a law. I am a 
real substitute: quarter to 7 to 3, teach 
five classes, do your bus duty, your 
lunchroom duty, and get worn out. So 
I have some appreciation for what it 
takes to teach, particularly in this dif-
ficult environment, and I especially 
want to thank our teachers. 
But that 70 percent figure that I am 
talking about, the number of our pub-
lic school children in Louisiana who 
are back to in-person learning, is only 
40 percent nationwide, and that is an 
embarrassment. That is a disgrace. We 
are doing immeasurable damage—im-
measurable damage—to a generation of 
children. 
Now, I don’t need to tell you we have 
been struggling with elementary and 
secondary education for the last 40 or 
50 years, and it is very frustrating be-
cause Americans can do extraordinary

one and make it beat. Americans can 
send a person to the moon and bring 
him back or her back. But we struggle 
to teach our kids how to read and write 
and understand the meaning of their 
diplomas when we have 18 years to do 
it. 
Now, there are a lot of reasons for 
that, and I am sure not blaming any-
body, and I don’t want to digress. But 
my point is, we were struggling before 
the coronavirus. That should tell us 
that now more than ever, given our cir-
cumstances before the coronavirus, we 
need to take meaningful steps to get 
these schools back open. 
We know that it is safe. The CDC Di-
rector under President Trump has said 
it was safe. The CDC Director under 
President Biden has said it is safe. 
Vaccination across America is—we 
started out a little rocky, a lot like our 
testing program, but it is getting much 
better. 
I read an article the other day in the 
Wall Street Journal, written by a 
Johns Hopkins researcher, physician, 
who said, in his opinion, about six or 
seven times more Americans have had 
the coronavirus than we know of; 
therefore, they do have immunity. And 
he said, coupled with the number of 
people who have had and survived 
coronavirus and our vaccine program, 
which is getting more aggressive every 
day, we could have a substantial reduc-
tion in the number of coronavirus cases 
by March and April. Indeed, we have 
seen the decline in the number of our 
cases now, today, starting from early 
January. They have declined dramati-
cally. And people smarter than me 
have suggested it is our vaccines, it is 
the approach to herd immunity, and, of 
course, it is the habits that we have de-
veloped in terms of social distancing 
and masking and good hygiene. 
But my point is that the experts, the 
science, all tell us that it is safe. And 
I have to tell you, I don’t mean to be 
unfair because I know it is com-
plicated, or it can be, and I don’t mean 
disrespect, but I have been very, very 
disappointed with President Biden. He 
has flipped and flopped on this issue 
like a banked catfish. He has said we 
need to follow science, but he refuses 
to follow the science in terms of open-
ing our schools. 
We know it can be done because we 
have been doing it in Louisiana. We 
have done it. If you look nationwide at 
the number of private schools that are 
open, back with in-person education, 
the number of parochial schools, the 
number of Catholic schools—they are 
doing it. Why can’t we do it in our pub-
lic schools? 
It is not money. For our first five 
coronavirus bills—I am not counting 
President 
Biden’s 
proposed 
bill. 
Through our first five coronavirus 
bills, we have appropriated between $70 
billion and $80 billion to our public 
schools to get them back open. Our 
public schools have spent $5 billion out 
of 70 to 80—I think it is $70 billion. So 
it is not a matter of money. I think it 
is just—I am not sure what it is. I don’t 
want to be a cynic and say that it is a 
matter of will. But here is what I am 
asking President Biden to do; here is 
what I would do if I were King for a 
day. I am not; I don’t aspire to be. But 
here is what I am hoping that Presi-
dent Biden will do this afternoon: Call 
a press conference, and look the Amer-
ican people in the eyes, and look our 
school board members in the eyes and 
our teachers and our parents and our 
maintenance workers and say that we 
need to open up. 
If we really believe we are only as 
good as our dreams, we are only as val-
uable as our children, then we need to 
act like it. And I think President Biden 
needs to call that press conference. He 
doesn’t need to talk about the science, 
though that is important, or the poli-
tics or nibble around the edges. He 
needs to look the American people in 
the eye and say: By God, open the 
schools. Open the schools. Our kids de-
serve no less. 
There is not much I agree with 
former Congressman and Mayor Rahm 
Emanuel on, even though I think he is 
a bright guy, but politically we ap-
proach the world differently. But he 
said when he was mayor that kids drop 
out—not in the 12th grade. They drop 
out in pre-K and kindergarten and the 
first, second, third, and the fourth 
grades. We are going to lose a whole 
generation of kids here. 
I see I have some additional time 
while we are waiting on Senator SCHU-
MER. I think I am going to take my ad-
ditional time—and I will cut it short if 
Senator SCHUMER
is here—to talk 
about another issue. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. President, I want to talk about 
the European Union’s approach to Rus-
sia. We know that in February, the 
Russian Government sentenced Alexei 
Navalny, a very prominent opposition 
leader to Mr. Putin, to almost 3 years 
in prison. And shortly afterward, Mr. 
Putin directed that thousands of Mr. 
Navalny’s supporters who were pro-
testing be arrested. 
What was he—what were his sup-
porters—arrested for? Criticizing Mr. 
Putin. Navalny’s imprisonment comes 
in the wake of his near-fatal poisoning, 
about which we have all read. And 
what happened to Mr. Navalny should 
be a wake-up call to our friends in Eu-
rope. It is certainly a wake-up call to 
the American people. 
This isn’t the first time that Mr. 
Putin has tried to get rid of a dis-
sident. 
Unfortunately, 
it 
probably 
won’t be the last. For years, Russia has 
been making trouble, both at home and 
abroad. Mr. Putin has made trouble 
here in America, about which we all 
know. Domestically, opponents of Mr. 
Putin have been arrested. They have 
died in prison. In some cases, they have 
been murdered. We all know that. 
Now, if this is how Mr. Putin is going 
to treat his own people, imagine how 
he would and has treated foreign coun-
tries, particularly our friends in Eu-
rope. Russia has launched an unjusti-
fied invasion of Georgia. It still con-
trols large parts of Georgian territory. 
In 2014, Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine. He 
illegally annexed the Crimea. He start-
ed a war in Eastern Ukraine. It cost 
about 14,000 lives. 
But Russia’s aggression—Mr. Putin’s 
aggression—and let me say, I am not 
impugning the people of Russia. They 
are wonderful people. I admire them 
deeply. But their leadership, their po-
litical leadership, is lacking. And Mr. 
Putin’s aggression begs the question: If 
NATO troops did not stand in the way, 
what else would Russia do? Who knows 
what would happen to Poland and the 
Baltic States and other countries that 
were once part of the Soviet sphere. 
The Economist puts it this way—I 
am going to quote: 
Russia’s gangsterism has become impos-
sible to ignore. 
Russia’s gangsterism has become impos-
sible to ignore. 
But our friends in Europe seem to be 
doing a pretty good job of it. 
The Navalny case shows that criti-
cizing the Kremlin comes with a cost, 
but it is a cost that we and the Euro-
pean Union can and must bear because 
the price of appeasement is too high. 
And our European friends can do it, 
taken as a group. Senator SCHUMER 
knows this. The EU’s power surpasses 
Russia’s by far. The EU is a bloc of 450 
million people. Its GDP is nine times 
larger than Russia’s. 
Russia’s economy is only slightly 
bigger than Spain’s, and it is smaller 
than the economy of Italy. A lot of 
people don’t realize this, but Russia— 
look, I will concede them this: They 
have nuclear weapons and good spies. 
But the economy of Russia is smaller 
than the economy of New York State. 
So why is Europe so content to be 
bullied? 
I am going to give you a quick case 
in point. Josep Borrell visited Russia 
following Navalny’s imprisonment. Mr. 
Borrell is the EU’s top foreign affairs 
official. He allowed—stood there and 
allowed—Russian 
Foreign 
Minister 
Lavrov—I know Mr. Lavrov. Perhaps 
you have met him, Mr. President. I un-
derstand his personality. He doesn’t ex-
haust himself trying to win friends. 
But Mr. Borrell, representing the EU, 
its top foreign official in foreign af-
fairs, stood there and allowed Foreign 
Minister Lavrov to push him around 
shamelessly. The Russian Foreign Min-
ister insulted the EU. He called it an 
unreliable partner while Borrell stood 
there and said nothing—nothing. 
Another 
example, 
Germany. 
Ger-
many is still supporting construction 
of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, a 
project that is going to leave Europe 
even more reliant on Russian oil and 
gas. We are going backward here. This 
is going to make the EU even more vul-
nerable to Russian influence because 
we know that a more independent Eu-
rope becomes—the more Europe be-
comes dependent on Russian energy, 
the more reluctant it will be to defend 
itself against its neighbor’s bullying.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S835 
February 24, 2021 
I don’t want to beat this point to 
death. America is ready to do its part. 
We have imposed sanctions on Mr. 
Putin. I support President Biden’s at-
tempt to engage our friends in Europe 
and our effort to try to convince China 
to become a stable part of world order, 
but we shouldn’t forget to do the same 
thing with respect to Mr. Putin. Mr. 
Putin’s aggression should teach us 
something: What you allow is what will 
continue. 
I yield the floor to the distinguished 
Senator from New York. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend from Louisiana for his 
erudite remarks, much of which—at 
least the last part I heard—I agree 
with. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Mr. President, even now, even as we 
continue to confirm President Biden’s 
nominees here on the floor, the Senate 
Democratic majority is busy working 
on the American Rescue Plan. The 
country has just suffered from a once- 
in-a-century 
event 
that 
shuttered 
thousands of businesses, sapped more 
than 10 million jobs, and, according to 
CBO, left a $17 trillion hole in our econ-
omy. 
As the distribution of the vaccine fi-
nally begins to accelerate under the 
Biden administration, there is cer-
tainly hope on the horizon. But we are 
a far way off from a full recovery, and 
it is our job—our job—to help millions 
of Americans—struggling Americans— 
through the next several months of dif-
ficulty and hasten the day when our 
country can finally return to normal. 
The American Rescue Plan is de-
signed to do just that—keep American 
families and businesses and schools and 
workers afloat until they can get back 
on their feet. And there is a broad con-
sensus that our country needs more 
support to get through this crisis. May-
ors and Governors from both parties 
support the plan. The Republican Gov-
ernor of West Virginia told Congress: 
‘‘[W]e need to go big.’’ 
Economists from across the political 
spectrum say that our economy needs 
further support. The Chair of the Fed-
eral Reserve, appointed by President 
Trump, just told us that ‘‘the economic 
recovery remains uneven and far from 
complete, and the path ahead is highly 
uncertain.’’ Chairman Powell, hardly a 
raving liberal, concluded: ‘‘There is a 
long way to go.’’ 
And it has broad support in America. 
Seven in 10 Americans approve of the 
American Rescue Plan. In some polls I 
have seen, a majority of Republicans 
approve of this plan—Republican vot-
ers, not Republicans here in the Sen-
ate. 
Now, it is easy to see why there is 
such broad support. The COVID pan-
demic is the worst economic crisis 
since the Great Depression, the worst 
public health crisis our Nation has 
faced in 100 years. But our Republican 
colleagues say all these groups de-
manding the $1.9 trillion American 
Rescue Plan—business leaders, govern-
ment 
officials 
from 
both 
parties, 
economists from across the spectrum, 
and 7 in 10 Americans—Republicans say 
all of them are wrong. 
According to a report in CNN, Repub-
lican leaders are maneuvering to get 
every single Republican Member to op-
pose the emerging legislation—every 
single one. 
Make no mistake, Republicans op-
pose the American Rescue Plan to the 
detriment of the country, and they do 
so at their own political peril. If our 
Republican colleagues want to oppose 
direct checks to struggling families; 
food assistance to hungry Americans; 
keeping teachers, firefighters, and es-
sential public employees on the job; 
providing another round of support for 
small business; helping schools reopen 
as quickly and safely as possible; 
speeding vaccinations around the coun-
try—well, if congressional Republicans 
want to oppose all that, my response 
is, good luck. 
The country needs this final push. It 
is overwhelmingly popular. A new anal-
ysis this morning showed another vac-
cine produced by a U.S. company is 
safe and effective, which only under-
scores the need for Federal dollars to 
accelerate its distribution. It will help 
millions of American families survive 
the ongoing crisis, recuperate from the 
economic hardship of the past year, 
and set our country on a firm path to 
recovery. 
That is why Senate Democrats have 
made it the first legislative item on 
our agenda. By stark contrast, the first 
action item taken by the Republican 
Senate majority when they got the ma-
jority in 2017 was an attempt to repeal 
our Nation’s healthcare law and rip 
health coverage away from millions of 
Americans. Republicans followed it up 
with a giant tax cut disproportionately 
aimed at rich corporations and the 
uber-rich. 
The Democratic Senate majority is 
going to start on a much different 
note. This week, the House—and soon 
thereafter the Senate—will start work-
ing on President Biden’s American Res-
cue Plan to deliver desperately and ur-
gently needed assistance to the Amer-
ican people. 
One final note on this topic—the 
minimum wage. As it has been reported 
widely, the Senate Parliamentarian is 
hearing arguments today on the $15 
minimum wage policy included in the 
House version of the bill. According to 
the Congressional Budget Office, rais-
ing the Federal minimum wage to $15 
an hour has a significant budgetary im-
pact, which should make it permissible 
under the Senate’s reconciliation rules. 
I want to thank all of the hard-work-
ing Senate staffers on my staff, Sen-
ator SANDERS’ staff, and many others 
in participating in these arguments 
today. 
CHINA 
Mr. President, on another matter. 
Everyone knows our country and our 
economy face daunting challenges be-
yond COVID–19. While our two parties 
don’t agree on a whole lot, both Repub-
licans and Democrats know that one of 
the main challenges of the 21st century 
will be competing with and confronting 
China. 
The roots of this challenge go back 
decades. When I was first elected to the 
Senate visiting all corners of New 
York, I saw entire industries going 
under as a result of unfair Chinese 
competition and the manipulation of 
the currency by China. For decades, 
China has effectively cheated and sto-
len its way to economic growth, engag-
ing in brazen theft of American intel-
lectual property via cyber operations, 
forced technology transfers, the dump-
ing of cheap goods in our economy, and 
for a while, the pernicious manipula-
tion of its currency. American workers, 
academics, and businesses of all sizes 
have paid the price to the tune of mil-
lions of jobs and trillions of dollars of 
wealth. 
More recently, China has directed its 
energy and mercantilist policies to-
ward beating the United States and 
like-minded countries to the pole posi-
tion on all leading technologies in the 
21st century. 
When I say ‘‘China,’’ I mean the Chi-
nese Government and the China Com-
munist Party. The American people 
have nothing against the Chinese peo-
ple. 
I have made no secret of America’s 
failure to hold the Chinese Government 
accountable, and that has been a fail-
ure of both parties—both parties in the 
past. After another bout of tough talk, 
we are not much closer to reining in 
China’s predatory behavior than we 
were 4 years ago. That is why yester-
day, I asked the chairs and members of 
our relevant Senate committees to 
begin work on legislation to enable the 
United States to outcompete China and 
create American jobs. 
At the core of this effort will be the 
Endless Frontier Act. This is a bipar-
tisan legislation that Senator YOUNG 
and I sponsored and drafted together 
over a year ago. It would surge re-
sources into the National Science 
Foundation and the Department of 
Commerce to advance American inno-
vation in a number of critical tech-
nologies. 
We must also consider significant in-
vestments, even through emergency 
appropriations, to rebuild the capacity 
of the U.S. semiconductor industry. 
This, too, is a bipartisan effort that 
Senators COTTON
and CORNYN
joined 
Senator WARNER and I, and we placed 
the original authorizing legislation in 
the Defense bill. 
Right now, semiconductor manufac-
turing is a dangerous weak spot in our 
economy and in our national security. 
Our auto industry is facing significant 
chip shortages. This is a technology 
the United States created, and we

ought to be leading the world in. The 
same goes for building out 5G, the 
next-generation 
telecommunications 
network. There is bipartisan interest 
on both these issues. 
Overall, the new legislation must 
achieve three goals: one, boost Amer-
ican competitiveness by investing in 
our economy and our workers; two, le-
verage our alliances abroad; and, three, 
stop once and for all China’s predatory 
practices. A number of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle have strong 
bipartisan ideas on these issues, includ-
ing Senators MENENDEZ
and RISCH, 
BROWN
and TOOMEY, CANTWELL
and 
WICKER. I hope we can all work to-
gether to craft a bill that meets that 
moment. 
It is my intention to put this legisla-
tion on this topic on the Senate floor 
for a vote this spring. I urge the com-
mittees to continue their work in a bi-
partisan way so we can have strong 
legislation before us. 
It so happens that today, at the other 
end of Pennsylvania Avenue, signifi-
cant work will be done on the same 
issues. President Biden has invited a 
bipartisan group of lawmakers to the 
White House to discuss concerns with 
the U.S. supply chain, particularly the 
semiconductor shortage, and will sign 
an Executive order aimed at plugging 
the holes. I applaud both the meeting 
and the Executive order. The new ad-
ministration is taking a strong first 
step in shoring up America’s critical 
supply chains and putting a spotlight 
on American competitiveness. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, finally, I want to com-
mend the Rules Committee and the 
Homeland Security Committee yester-
day for holding an important hearing 
examining the attack on January 6, a 
horrible, horrible attack. It was the 
first of what will be many examina-
tions of the events on January 6 and 
how we can prevent such an attack 
from ever happening again. 
The hearing revealed several security 
and communication failures that must 
be addressed going forward and fol-
lowed up on in future investigations. 
Regrettably, the hearing also revealed 
that there are still Members of the 
Senate Republican minority who are 
willing to continue the campaign of 
misinformation, deception, and con-
spiracy that helped fuel the attack on 
January 6 in the first place. 
Let me be very clear. Blaming the 
January 6 attack on provocateurs and 
fake Trump protesters is mindless gar-
bage. It has no basis in fact. Perpet-
uating and giving a platform to those 
lies is a preposterous contribution to a 
Senate hearing devoted to Capitol se-
curity. Everyone—everyone needs to 
move forward by sticking to the facts 
and engaging in a very serious discus-
sion about the security of the Capitol 
Complex. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I discussed the K–12 crisis fac-
ing American families. The science 
shows that in-person schooling can eas-
ily be made safe. Private and religious 
schools and schools in Europe have 
been open for months. 
But Washington Democrats have ap-
parently bought into Big Labor’s myth 
that schools cannot reopen without 
even 
more 
Federal 
funding, 
even 
though their own plan would only 
spend about 5 percent—5 percent of the 
money this fiscal year. 
This is just one illustration of how 
Democrats started with preconceived 
ideological goals and actually worked 
backward, instead of starting with the 
actual needs of American families. 
Let’s take a look at the economy. 
When we had to stall our economy to 
protect our health system, the Senate 
wrote the bipartisan CARES Act, the 
biggest rescue package in American 
history. It spent $2.2 trillion to save 
the healthcare system, find vaccines, 
and support families. We refilled many 
of those programs with another $920 
billion just last December. 
Today, we stand at a very different 
kind of crossroads. More than 13 per-
cent of Americans have received at 
least one dose of the vaccine. Manufac-
turers expect vaccine supply to keep 
ramping up dramatically in the weeks 
ahead. 
The trillions we spent on rescue poli-
cies in 2020 had the economy prepped to 
come roaring back as health conditions 
keep improving. 
Unemployment 
today 
is 
already 
lower than where, at one point in this 
crisis, the Federal Reserve predicted it 
would be by the end of the year. In 
some blue-collar sectors, both total 
employment and job openings are al-
ready higher than they were before the 
pandemic. Retail sales just smashed 
experts’ predictions. Many manufactur-
ers can’t keep pace with demand. 
Remarkably, even as economic out-
put obviously shrunk in 2020, overall 
household personal income and per-
sonal savings actually went up. That is 
because of the relief Congress deliv-
ered. 
There is no question that some 
American families are still struggling. 
Nobody thinks our health or economic 
fight is finished yet, but on a broad na-
tional scale, households are sitting on 
an historic pile of pent-up cash, wait-
ing for the economy to reopen. 
The 
former 
head 
of 
President 
Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers 
says: 
We have no historic parallel with anything 
like this level of excess saving. 
He says we have never seen this 
much ‘‘dry powder.’’ 
Even mainstream liberal economists 
agree that our country does not need 
another massive fire hose of borrowed 
money. This is not April of 2020. This is 
a different chapter. Washington should 
focus on practical policies to finish 
this fight: accelerate vaccinations; get 
kids back in school; help the families 
and small businesses that actually 
need help; and get laid-off Americans 
matched with job openings ASAP. 
Unfortunately, the Democrats’ par-
tisan proposal would not just be waste-
ful but, in certain ways, actually coun-
terproductive. It would have Wash-
ington go out of its way to discourage 
hiring, discourage a return to work, 
and actually keep things shut down 
longer. 
Take the minimum wage policy. The 
CBO says this abrupt, one-size-fits-all 
change would kill about 11⁄2 times as 
many jobs as the number of workers it 
would lift out of poverty. 
Or take their proposal for another 
long-term extension of a big Federal 
supplement to unemployment benefits. 
Even in the middle of last year, it was 
questionable policy to pay people more 
to stay home than essential workers 
were earning while actually on the job. 
Now another long-term, flat supple-
ment would make even less sense. 
Here is how one leading economist 
puts it: 
In an expanding economy that is putting 
the virus behind it, paying people more in 
unemployment than they could receive from 
working is an act of substantial economic 
self-harm. It would keep workers on the side-
lines, stop the unemployment rate from fall-
ing as rapidly as it otherwise would, and 
slow the overall recovery. 
Then there is the $350 billion bailout 
for State and local governments, many 
of whom have already seen revenues 
and receipts rebound. It is several mul-
tiples of any sober estimate of the ac-
tual need. Apparently, even Senators 
on the Democratic side are trying to 
pare back this absurd request—just one 
more way this proposal seems to be 
stuck back in April of last year. 
I haven’t even talked about the hun-
dreds of millions of dollars for pet 
projects without a shred of relevance 
to the pandemic or the recovery— 
money for ‘‘climate justice,’’ transpor-
tation earmarks for the Democratic 
leader’s home State—all kinds of lib-
eral wish list items that would do 
nothing to help American families put 
COVID behind them. Just about 1 per-
cent of the money is for vaccines, so ei-
ther the new administration has com-
pletely taken their eye off the ball or 
they were not actually starting from 
scratch at all, like they claimed. Only 
5 percent of the education funding 
would even go out this fiscal year. Only 
5 percent of the education funding 
would go out this fiscal year.

leagues are reportedly admitting parts

of this are poorly targeted. Liberal 
economists and the Washington Post’s 
editorial board are saying Americans 
deserve more bang for their buck—a 
predictably chilly reception for a par-
tisan bill that started with an out-
dated, ideological wish list instead of 
the current needs of American fami-
lies. 
PROTESTS 
Now, Mr. President, on a completely 
different matter, I have been out-
spoken and clear about the crimes that 
were committed here on January 6. In 
my discussions with Judge Garland, 
the President’s nominee to be Attorney 
General, I specifically raised the need 
to continue investigating and pros-
ecuting anyone who broke the law that 
day. I am glad he has repeatedly em-
phasized this would remain a priority. 
Everyone agrees that day’s events 
must occasion a serious and thorough 
review of the specific institutions and 
security procedures within Congress 
that proved so insufficient. That proc-
ess is already underway as we saw with 
the joint hearing conducted yesterday 
by two Senate committees. 
The Speaker of the House proposes 
even more investigation through a new 
commission. She cites the precedent of 
the 9/11 Commission, but her draft bill 
fails to track with that precedent in 
key ways. 
The 
9/11 
Commission 
was 
inten-
tionally built to be bipartisan. The 50– 
50 bipartisan split of the commis-
sioners was a key feature. It both 
helped the effectiveness of the inves-
tigation itself and helped give the 
whole country confidence in its work 
and its recommendations. This time, 
however, Speaker PELOSI
started by 
proposing a commission that would be 
partisan 
by 
design—seven 
appoint-
ments for Democrats, just four for Re-
publicans. The 9/11 Commission also 
built consensus by requiring bipartisan 
support for subpoenas. The Speaker’s 
bill would vest subpoena power in one 
appointee chosen by the Democrats. 
Both the Democratic and Republican 
leaders of the 9/11 Commission are 
speaking out against this bizarrely par-
tisan concept. Let me say that again. 
The leaders of the 9/11 Commission— 
one Republican, one Democrat—are 
speaking out against the way this pro-
posal is crafted by the Speaker. 
Lee Hamilton, the Democratic Vice 
Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, says: 
That does not sound to me like a good 
start; it sounds like a partisan beginning. 
That was the Democratic Vice Chair-
man of the 9/11 Commission. 
Tom Kean, the Republican Chairman, 
pointed out what should be obvious: 
Unless you have equal representation . . . 
the report won’t have as much confidence 
from the American people. 
Any undertaking along these lines 
needs to be fair and needs to be even-
handed. That really shouldn’t be con-
troversial, and it goes beyond just a 
makeup of the panel. 
For example, the Speaker’s proposal 
imagines something more than an in-
vestigation into the specific security 
failures that occurred here at the Cap-
itol. It sets the stage for a somewhat 
broader inquiry into ‘‘domestic violent 
extremism’’ beyond just that day, but 
the partisan panel would get to decide 
which other incidents are and are not 
‘‘relevant.’’ 
Rioting and political violence are ab-
horrent and unacceptable no matter 
what cause the mob is advancing. 
These are not forms of political speech. 
For almost a year now, we have seen 
political violence and riots become an 
increasingly normalized phenomenon 
across our national life. None of us 
should accept that. 
January 6 was uniquely grave be-
cause the intent was to interrupt the 
constitutional duty of Congress, but if 
this new commission is to go beyond a 
targeted, after-action analysis of the 
security failures here at the Capitol 
complex and if Congress is going to at-
tempt some broader analysis of toxic 
political violence across the country, 
then, in that case, we cannot have an 
artificial cherry-picking of which ter-
rible behavior does and which terrible 
behavior does not deserve scrutiny. We 
could do something narrow that looks 
at the Capitol or we could potentially 
do something broader to analyze the 
full scope of the political violence here 
in our country. We cannot land at some 
artificial, politicized halfway point. 
Don’t take it from me. Take it from 
the Democratic and Republican leaders 
of the 9/11 Commission. An inquiry 
with a hard-wired partisan slant would 
never be legitimate in the eyes of the 
American people. An undertaking that 
is uneven or unjust would not help our 
country. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The assistant majority leader. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, I was home, as most Members of 
the Senate were, but I was asked to 
participate in a Zoom call with two 
people I highly respect, Dr. Anthony 
Fauci and Dr. Collins, with the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. While sit-
ting at my dining room table in 
Springfield, IL, there were about a 
dozen Senators who had access to 
Zoom to be a part of that conversation. 
I felt like I was privileged to really 
hear some information which most 
Americans wanted to hear, and I knew 
it had to be important for them to ask 
for a briefing in the middle of the 
week. 
What they were talking about during 
the course of that hour were variants, 
what is happening to this coronavirus 
as it replicates over and over and over 
again millions of times. What they told 
us—and I am a liberal arts lawyer, so I 
don’t profess any sort of medical exper-
tise here—was that there were domi-
nant variants that were starting to 
emerge, and they told us the shorthand 
description that they used in the lab-
oratories. 
I just remember that the first one 
was the UK, United Kingdom, variant. 
They said, by the end of March, which 
is not that far away—4 weeks plus—it 
will 
be 
the 
dominant 
strain 
of 
coronavirus in the United States. I was 
taken aback by that to think that a 
variant could become that dominant 
that quickly, but it was fair warning 
that it was about to occur. Then they 
talked about the South African vari-
ant, which is just starting to appear. 
The good news is they have done 
enough testing to believe that both of 
the major vaccines we are now using 
across America, which are Moderna 
and Pfizer—I have Pfizer, and my wife 
has Moderna—are effective against the 
UK, United Kingdom, variant. The jury 
is still out when it comes to the South 
African variant. There is a third vari-
ant, and I won’t venture into trying to 
remember 
exactly 
what 
that 
was 
about, but I remember it had some ori-
gin in South America. 
I heard that news, and I thought to 
myself, this is an ongoing battle. We 
haven’t run up any kind of score 
against this coronavirus. We can’t sit 
back and relax. We are in a very busy 
third quarter in trying to vaccinate 
America and in watching for each and 
every new threat. 
So, in that circumstance, if you were 
the President of the United States, 
what would you do? 
Well, Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, 
decided that we needed to be aggres-
sive, that we needed to face reality, not 
only with regard to the half a million 
Americans who have died but that we 
need to put together the tools to fight 
this coronavirus as we know it and as 
it is likely to evolve. He needs an army 
to do that. It is that big a war. He 
came to us with a proposal to start 
that effort, in a substantial way, under 
his leadership. He calls it the American 
Rescue Plan. I hear my colleagues 
come to the floor and really raise the 
question as to whether this is needed, 
and I just heard the speech of the mi-
nority leader, Senator MCCONNELL. 
What President Biden wants to do to 
deal with this pandemic, as we know it 
and as it is likely to evolve, is to pro-
vide $20 billion more for our vaccina-
tion program. Does anyone doubt the 
need for that? I don’t. I think it is the 
key to getting America back to busi-
ness. 
He provides $50 billion for testing, lab 
capacity improvements, and genomic 
sequencing of this virus mutation. 
Again, I am not an expert in science, 
but it seems perfectly reasonable to 
me, after listening to Drs. Fauci and 
Collins, to make that investment right 
now. 
President Biden wants to invest in 
100,000 community health workers to 
help with the vaccinations and contact 
tracing—100,000. It seems like a lot, but 
in a nation of 350 million, I am not sure 
it is that overwhelming a number. He 
wants to fund the community health 
centers so that they will be able to 
tackle this issue and particularly ad-
dress the issue of health disparities;

use the Defense Production Act to pro-
vide $10 billion for America’s manufac-
turer of the key equipment we need to 
fight this pandemic and the next one, 
God forbid, whenever it may be; and to 
expand healthcare coverage for Ameri-
cans in this time of pandemic by sub-
sidizing COBRA coverage. What does it 
mean? If you had health insurance with 
your job and you lost your job and you 
lost your health insurance, we allow 
people to buy that health insurance 
that the employer offered, but they 
have to pay for the whole ride, both the 
employer’s and employee’s sides of it, 
and it turns out to be prohibitive. It 
doesn’t work unless we give a subsidy 
for that coverage to be extended into 
your unemployment situation. 
And then $4 billion, which sounds 
small when we are talking trillions, 
but $4 billion for community health— 
pardon me—behavioral health and ad-
diction services and counseling serv-
ices. 
I learned the hard way over that 
break as well that we are ignoring the 
opiate crisis in America, but it is not 
ignoring us. It is dramatically increas-
ing, primarily because we are not de-
voting the resources to it. And the 
mental health situation of many Amer-
icans is aggravated by isolation and so-
cial distancing, and addiction is even 
worse. 
So I have just described for you the 
health side of President Biden’s Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. I would like to hear 
any of my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle argue with me—I am ready 
to take them on—that that is not need-
ed. Of course it is needed. It is needed 
now, and it needs to be an investment 
we make because if we don’t break the 
back of this pandemic, we are not 
going to get this economy reopen 
again, we are not going to get our kids 
back in school, we are not going to get 
to see our grandkids the way we want 
to, our children or grandkids, and we 
are not going to see America return to 
what we all desperately want it to re-
turn to. 
The reason I raise that this morning 
is when I heard the Senator from Ken-
tucky raising skeptical observations 
about this plan, I thought back. It was 
a year ago on the floor of the Senate— 
nothing short of a political miracle— 
that the first CARES Act, under Presi-
dent Donald Trump, the first CARES 
Act passed this Senate with an over-
whelming vote of 96 to nothing. That 
doesn’t happen much around here, even 
for resolutions on motherhood. But 96 
to nothing—bipartisan support for the 
relief bill proposed by President Trump 
and the Congress in March of last year. 
It was a good feeling, and we knew we 
had to do it. We were in it together, 
and we knew we had a challenge. 
Then came last December, just a few 
weeks back, and again under the 
Trump administration a proposal for a 
$900 billion relief bill for COVID–19. It 
passed the Senate with 92 votes, 92 out 
of 100 Senators. It just showed the bi-
partisanship that we mustered, thank 
goodness, when we needed it because 
the Nation needed it, and we did it to-
gether—96 in March, 92 Senators in De-
cember. We stood behind that plan 
even though it had the blessing of a 
President of a different party at a con-
troversial moment in history. We stood 
behind it because the American people 
needed it. 
Now comes President Joe Biden, 5 or 
6 weeks into his Presidency, and says: 
Let me take my leadership opportunity 
and responsibility seriously, and let me 
come with a $1.9 trillion American Res-
cue Plan. Where is the bipartisanship 
that we saw last year? 
I do want to dispute the conclusion of 
Senator MCCONNELL when it comes to 
the state of the economy. I did take a 
few economics courses. I don’t profess 
to be an expert. Let’s listen to someone 
who is: Federal Reserve Chairman Je-
rome Powell, testifying on Capitol Hill. 
What did he have to say? Well, he told 
us that we are in a situation that is far 
from over. We have an economy that is 
still challenging. 
Here are some things that were left 
out of the rosy analysis by the Senator 
from Kentucky: 
‘‘There are still 10 million more un-
employed people than before the pan-
demic began.’’ Ten million unemployed 
American workers. ‘‘While many parts 
of the economy have recovered,’’ Chair-
man Powell said, ‘‘the unemployment 
rate for the lowest-paid quarter of the 
labor force is probably above 20 per-
cent.’’ Above 20 percent. ‘‘There’s a 
long way to go,’’ Chairman Powell said. 
Economic activity rebounded in the 
summer after much of the economy re-
opened from spring shutdowns. But 
that 
momentum 
‘‘slowed 
substan-
tially,’’ in the words of Chairman Pow-
ell, with sectors that rely on person-to- 
person contact, like hospitality and en-
tertainment, enduring the worst blows. 
‘‘That burden has also largely fallen on 
low-wage workers, Black and Hispanic 
Americans, 
and 
other 
minority 
groups,’’ Powell said. 
I don’t believe we are out of the 
woods yet. I believe we have got a long 
way to go. The American people be-
lieve that too. 
President Biden believes it, and when 
he starts talking about getting us back 
on our feet, he is suggesting extending 
unemployment 
insurance 
programs 
that expire in just 2 weeks. On March 
14, unemployment programs will start 
to expire, and he wants us to move 
quickly to make sure that doesn’t hap-
pen. 
I support that effort for two reasons. 
First, it is humane. We are talking 
about fellow Americans out of work 
through no choice of their own. Sec-
ondly, putting money into unemploy-
ment benefits for unemployed workers 
is the single best investment when it 
comes to revitalizing the economy. 
They do not turn to the Wall Street 
Journal 
when 
they 
receive 
those 
checks; they turn to the mailbox and 
try to figure out how they are going to 
pay the rent and pay for the food on 
the table. They spend the money. That 
is what unemployment is all about. 
So to have the other side question 
President Biden’s proposal to give un-
employment benefits beyond March 14 
really says that they are turning their 
backs on millions of Americans who 
have no place else to go. 
Oh, there is a fear on the other side 
that we just may be paying people too 
much. You know, if you give them a 
little too much money on unemploy-
ment, they just might sit home and 
binge on Netflix and chocolate-covered 
cherries. Well, I suppose that is always 
going to happen no matter how you 
write the laws, but I think a lot more 
of American workers. I believe they 
want to get back to work anywhere 
near the salaries that they left behind. 
I think they are desperately looking 
for those opportunities, and we ought 
to help them in the meantime keep 
their families together. 
Emergency paid leave is still an abso-
lute 
necessity 
in 
light 
of 
this 
coronavirus and the way it deals with 
us. 
I want to also make a plea here for 
the minimum wage, and I know there 
is some controversy associated with it. 
Mr. President, glad to have you. You 
are new to the Senate. 
Back at that desk there, a fellow 
named Ted Kennedy used to stand. I 
used to love to come to the floor when 
Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts 
would give his speeches. When he got 
into it, he was amazing. His booming 
voice could be heard all over the Sen-
ate Chamber, and I never heard him 
more energized than when he argued 
for increasing the minimum wage. 
Oftentimes he was a lonely voice— 
there were no proposals before us and 
none likely to appear—but he never 
failed to come to this floor and remind 
us on a regular basis of how we had 
failed year after year after year to in-
crease the minimum wage. 
He would tell the story of people in 
America getting up and going to work 
every single day, sometimes two jobs a 
day, to try to keep their families to-
gether and still qualifying for food 
stamps and assistance from our govern-
ment. He would ask us when we were 
going to give them the dignity of pass-
ing an increase in the minimum wage. 
I can still hear him thundering 
across the Chamber. I wouldn’t want to 
be in the place of arguing a different 
position than the one he held because 
he took it over. I don’t have that skill; 
I wish I did. I am glad to have seen him 
use that skill so effectively to help 
people who were just doing their best 
to get by and struggling. 
How many times do all of us give 
speeches about inequality in America 
and why we have to do better for the 
working people? We do it all the time, 
and everybody knows it is a fact. 
Wages in America, salaries have not 
kept up. People at the top have done 
quite well, thank you, but those at the 
bottom have struggled to get by. 
Try to make it on $7.25 an hour. I was 
trying to do a calculation earlier on

just what that is. Is that $15,000 a year? 
Is that $1,200 a month? Is that $300 a 
week? Could you make it on $300 a 
week? I am talking about everything, 
now. I am talking about rent and mort-
gage and car payment, food, utilities— 
the basics. I couldn’t. I don’t know how 
anyone can, and most can’t. They fall 
deeply into debt and into despair. 
So when President Biden talks about 
us reopening the conversation about 
our Federal minimum wage, it is long 
overdue—long overdue—and it is an 
easier issue for me than some because 
our Governor, J. B. Pritzker, when he 
took over the State of Illinois, set us 
on course to reach $15 an hour as a 
State over the same period of time that 
Joe Biden has suggested, by 2025. 
I just want to say that those people 
who are really struggling with the no-
tion of increasing the minimum wage 
in all fairness really ought to think 
about the people out there who are 
struggling to get by week to week and 
month to month. 
There is another proposal that is in 
this bill that is currently being de-
bated, and it is the $1,400 addition to 
the cash payment for many families. I 
put it in the same category in order to 
restore equity and opportunity to a lot 
of people who otherwise wouldn’t have 
it. This is the second installment. The 
first was $600 in the bill we passed last 
December. This $1,400 payment will 
help many families. 
I want to add one element that was 
debated a few weeks ago. Senator TODD 
YOUNG of Indiana, whom I respect and 
is a friend, had offered an amendment 
at what was known as a vote-arama as 
to who would receive this $600 pay-
ment. I think the payment amount has 
been increased in the latest Biden pro-
posal. 
But the point I tried to make and I 
think he and I agree on, although I 
won’t speak for him, is that if a child 
legally in America, a citizen of this 
country, with a Social Security num-
ber, lives in a household with parents 
who are undocumented—they may be 
working and paying taxes with some-
thing called an ITIN—but that child 
should not be discriminated against or 
at a disadvantage because of the par-
ents’ immigration status. If the chil-
dren qualify, the children should be re-
ceiving those payments. I believe the 
House reconciliation bill does that, and 
I hope that any measure that we con-
sider will do the same. 
So let me close. I see the Senator on 
the floor asking for an opportunity to 
speak. 
Yes, I support the American Rescue 
Plan. Is it possible that I would have 
written it differently? Yes. Are there 
provisions I would change? Yes. But I 
want to tell you, when we passed the 
CARES Act measure last December, 
that was true as well. 
We are in a time of a national chal-
lenge and a national crisis. We have a 
President who is facing it squarely, 
taking it on, accepting responsibility, 
and asking for our help. Can we do any-
thing less? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, earlier 
this month, 16 Democratic Senators in-
troduced a resolution calling for Presi-
dent Biden to forgive $50,000 of Federal 
student loan debt per borrower—$50,000. 
There is no question that student 
loan debt is a problem for many Ameri-
cans. College costs have risen to unre-
alistically high levels, and many stu-
dents or their parents take out unreal-
istic amounts of debt in response. But 
the answer to this problem is not to 
have the President or Congress simply 
step in and forgive a large chunk of 
student loan debt. 
To start with, Democrats’ plan is in-
credibly, fundamentally unfair. Right 
now, there are individuals around this 
country who have just paid off the last 
of their student loans. They have been 
working hard, making payments, some-
times for a couple of years, sometimes 
for a couple of decades, as was the case 
with me. What happens to these indi-
viduals if the President steps in and 
forgives $50,000 of student debt? Well, I 
will tell you what happens—nothing. 
These individuals who have worked 
hard for years to pay off their debt will 
see no benefit from the Democrats’ 
blanket loan forgiveness. Meanwhile, 
other Americans who have made no 
more than a month or two of payments 
will see their student loans entirely 
disappear. That is incredibly unfair. In 
addition to being unfair, forgiving stu-
dent loan debt does absolutely nothing 
to address the problems that created 
this debt crisis in the first place. In 
fact, the Democrats’ solution is likely 
to make things worse. 
What possible incentive will students 
have to take the responsible approach 
to borrowing if they think the Federal 
Government will step in and solve their 
debt problem? What incentive will col-
leges have to restrain tuition growth if 
they think they can rely on the Fed-
eral Government to subsidize their stu-
dents’ tuition fees through loan for-
giveness? 
Forgiving $50,000 in student loans 
would also set a terrible precedent on 
the sanctity of contracts. While it may 
at times be ill-advised, students freely 
enter into the agreements they make 
when they take out a loan. Should we 
really be teaching that agreements and 
contracts mean nothing, that people 
can incur debt and then not have to 
pay it off? And about that ‘‘not paying 
it off,’’ the phrase ‘‘student loan for-
giveness’’ carries with it a suggestion 
that these debts will just disappear, 
that $50,000 can be wiped off each 
American’s slate and vanish into the 
ether. 
But, of course, we know that is not 
the case either. This is money students 
have borrowed from the Federal Gov-
ernment, 
and 
if 
the 
Government 
doesn’t get that money back, the Gov-
ernment will be facing an unexpected 
debt. 
Now, some people, especially some 
Democrats, tend to talk as if the Gov-
ernment draws on an unlimited pot of 
money, but, of course, we know that is 
not true. Government funds aren’t any-
where close to being unlimited, and 
Government coffers are not filled from 
a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
They are filled by taxpayer dollars, 
and, sooner or later, it will be tax-
payers who foot the bill for any loan 
forgiveness 
program, 
including 
the 
many taxpayers who opted not to at-
tend college or chose a debt-free way of 
doing so. There are a lot of Americans 
out there who saved up to get a degree 
or went part-time to avoid incurring 
debt. Are they really supposed to foot 
the bill for other Americans’ student 
loans? 
While you might think that Demo-
crats’ plan is largely targeted to low- 
income or disadvantaged individuals, 
that is not actually the case. Under the 
Democrats’ plan, an American making 
$20,000 
and 
an 
American 
making 
$120,000 would receive the same loan re-
lief. In fact, since more loan dollars are 
held by those in higher income brack-
ets, higher income Americans could 
end up benefiting the most. And that 
brings up another thing that we need 
to remember. 
Yes, a number of Americans carry a 
significant amount of student loan 
debt, but some of those Americans 
have incurred that debt for a career 
that will bring significant financial re-
wards. 
Plus, a substantial portion of student 
loan debt is not for undergraduate de-
grees but for graduate and professional 
degrees. Under the Democrats’ student 
loan forgiveness proposal, taxpayers 
could be subsidizing not just bachelor’s 
degrees but master’s degrees and Ph.D. 
degrees, as well as law and medical de-
grees. 
Instead of putting taxpayers on the 
hook for billions, we should be focused 
on exploring ways to drive down edu-
cation costs and educate students on 
the dangers of taking on excessive 
debt. 
We should also be highlighting af-
fordable education options like our Na-
tion’s community and technical col-
leges. These colleges, like the out-
standing institutions we have in South 
Dakota, provide students with associ-
ate’s degrees, certificates, apprentice-
ships, opportunities to learn a trade, 
and more. 
There are also things we could do to 
help students pay off loans without 
putting taxpayers on the hook for such 
massive amounts of money. In Decem-
ber, Congress passed a 5-year legisla-
tion that I introduced with Senator 
WARNER to allow employers to help em-
ployees repay their loans. Our Em-
ployer Participation and Repayment 
Act amends the Educational Assistance 
Program to permit employers to make 
tax-free payments on their employees’ 
student loans. 
Previously, employers could make 
tax-free contributions to their employ-
ees’ tuition if their employees were 
currently taking classes, but they

couldn’t provide tax-free contributions

is a win-win situation. It is a win for 
employees who get help paying off 
their student loans, and it is a win for 
employers who have a new option for 
attracting 
and 
retaining 
talented 
workers. 
Our bill is not a silver bullet, but it 
will certainly help ease the pain of pay-
ing back student loans for a number of 
young Americans. I am pleased it was 
enacted into law for a 5-year period, 
and I hope Congress will act to make it 
permanent. 
Another big thing we could do is 
make sure that graduates have access 
to good-paying jobs. This is key to ena-
bling people to pay off their debt, and 
we should resolve to build on the eco-
nomic progress that we had made 
prepandemic and focus on policies that 
will allow our economy to grow and to 
thrive. 
High college costs and student debt 
are a problem, but blanket loan for-
giveness is not the answer. I hope that 
President Biden will resist Democratic 
calls to put taxpayers on the hook for 
literally billions and billions of dollars 
in student loans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

REOPENING SCHOOLS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, in re-
cent days the Biden administration has 
backed away from its original goal to 
reopen most schools within the first 100 
days. This comes despite new Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention re-
search recommending that schools can 
safely reopen for in-person instruction. 
Arkansas 
schools 
reopened 
their 
doors in August of 2020. Currently, the 
Arkansas Department of Education re-
ports that 67 percent of K–12 students 
are attending school in-person full 
time, almost 13 percent have a hybrid 
schedule, and 20 percent are entirely 
remote. 
Natural State school districts in-
vested in cleaning supplies, barriers, 
and retrofitting classrooms. Educators 
thought creatively and found solutions 
to these new problems. And although 
every school and community has dif-
ferent challenges, they moved ahead 
with the same goal: finding the best 
and the safest way to get and keep 
children and teachers in the classroom. 
I had the opportunity to visit several 
school districts last fall. I was so im-
pressed with their daily efforts to keep 
their doors open, keep their staff 
healthy, and provide the learning that 
children desperately need. 
These heroes need our support. Over 
the course of this past year, Congress 
has delivered $113 billion—and over $686 
million to Arkansas—to support edu-
cation through the COVID–19 pan-
demic, including nearly $68 billion to 
help bring K–12 students back into the 
classroom. That money is already hard 
at work. However, much of it remains 
to be spent. 
Parents can see that virtual learning 
simply isn’t working. If you need more 
evidence of the unbalanced impact of 
100-percent virtual learning, a study by 
the RAND Corporation in fall 2020 
highlighted tremendous areas of con-
cern. Researchers surveyed educators 
across the country and concluded that 
State and Federal Governments needed 
to prioritize making schools safe to at-
tend. One particularly shocking result 
of the survey found that principals in 
America’s highest poverty schools re-
ported only 80 percent of their students 
had adequate internet access at home. 
When schools are virtual, we are know-
ingly failing 20 percent of those stu-
dents without even getting to the ques-
tion of how effective the instruction is 
or addressing the negative effects on 
students’ social needs and develop-
ment. 
This crisis in education also means 
that 
families 
are 
falling 
behind. 
Women, in particular, are shouldering 
an incredible burden through this pan-
demic. In February 2020, women held 
the majority of nonfarm payroll jobs. 
They outnumbered men in the work-
force for the first time in American 
history. Today, the number of women 
in the workforce is at a 33-year low. 
Much of this is attributed to the out-
sized role women are playing in bal-
ancing their families’ financial, edu-
cational, and caregiving needs. 
Of all the challenges we have faced 
through the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
mission of educating children con-
tinues to be one of the most critical 
and complex. It has been rewarding to 
see educators receive their much need-
ed COVID–19 vaccine. These heroes are 
essential to our recovery. 
Arkansas is setting the example. The 
Natural State can be proud of the 
teachers, administrators, and elected 
leaders who continue to find ways to 
keep schools open and provide critical 
services that children deserve. It is 
time that students in other States 
have the same opportunities. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, a year 
ago, schools began to close due to the 
coronavirus. Teachers quickly scram-
bled to try to figure out how they were 
going to teach kids who weren’t there. 
They set up virtual classrooms on the 
internet. Parents started googling ac-
tivities to keep their children moti-
vated and active, but they didn’t start 
that a year ago. They started 11 
months ago. It didn’t take long to fig-
ure out that kids at home are different 
than kids at school. And even before 
that, many parents had to start accom-
modating their schedule to try to fig-
ure out how they were going to deal 
with this new and unanticipated sched-
ule. 
Congress stepped up. On multiple oc-
casions, we passed emergency legisla-
tion to get money to schools to clean 
classrooms, to buy laptops for stu-
dents, and to do almost anything else 
that schools thought they might need 
at the elementary and secondary level. 
But what started as what I believe ev-
erybody thought was a stopgap—cer-
tainly no longer than until the weather 
got hot in the summertime as we fin-
ished up the last school year—has be-
come, in many places, permanent, full 
time now, where students for a year 
have not been in school. That is despite 
a lot of widespread consensus that both 
scientists and medical experts think 
that kids can be back in the classroom. 
The science on studying and learning 
is also clear that when schools are 
closed, students suffer. There have 
been a lot of studies to show that pro-
longed remote learning puts kids at 
higher risk for falling behind, for fail-
ing classes, for suffering from mental 
health problems, and, in many cases, 
just deciding not to show up. And, you 
know, the one thing about virtual is it 
is pretty easy to not virtually be there 
as well. 
The risks on all those areas—the 
mental health problems, the falling be-
hind, 
the 
failing 
grades—are 
even 
greater for students with disabilities or 
for minorities or people who live in 
generally underserved areas. A study 
by McKinsey looked at the toll pro-
longed remote learning has taken on 
students. It estimated that when it 
comes to mathematics, students, on 
average, are likely to lose 5 to 9 
months of learning by the end of this 
school year. It said that students of 
color—this is according to McKinsey— 
could be 6 to 12 months behind at the 
end of this school year. Think about 
that. One year of remote learning could 
leave students 1 year behind where 
they should be in math if you look at 
these expert studies. 
In addition to the academic damage, 
remote learning has led to an increase 
in mental health challenges facing stu-
dents. A report by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention found that 
mental health problems accounted for 
a growing proportion of students’ visits 
to hospital emergency rooms. Visits 
were up 31 percent for kids between 
ages 12 and 17 and 24 percent for kids 
between ages 5 and 11, and according to 
the CDC, many of those visits are based 
on a mental health challenge rather

than some other kind of health chal-
lenge. 
The risk of keeping kids at home are 
significant. What is worse, they are un-
necessary by the growing number of 
people who are looking at this. Dr. Ro-
chelle Walensky, who is the head of 
CDC, recently appointed by President 
Biden—she began her work there on 
January 21—talked about what we 
should do earlier this month. She said 
that there was ‘‘increasing data’’—‘‘in-
creasing data that schools can safely 
reopen.’’ That ends the quote, but she 
went on to say, even if teachers aren’t 
vaccinated for the virus. 
Anthony Fauci—Dr. Fauci echoed 
that point. He said: ‘‘I would back the 
CDC recommendation because that is 
really based on data . . . we need to try 
and get the children back to school.’’ 
That ends Dr. Fauci’s quote. He went 
on a step further by saying that it is 
not even workable to wait for every 
teacher to be vaccinated before schools 
reopen because, when you think about 
that, if every teacher had their first 
vaccine today in the double-vaccine 
world we are still in, it will be the end 
of March before every teacher had their 
second vaccine, and you are so far 
down the line, before you know it, the 
school might not be able to reopen in 
that circumstance. 
Dr. David Rosen, a professor of pedi-
atric infectious diseases at Washington 
University in St. Louis, said: 
There is no situation in which schools 
can’t be open unless they have evidence of 
in-school transmission. 
The Biden White House actually im-
mediately said they just didn’t agree 
with the experts on this, even the ones 
in their own administration. The Presi-
dent’s Press Secretary said that Dr. 
Walensky was speaking in her personal 
capacity when she said that you can go 
back to school even if teachers weren’t 
vaccinated, even though she was speak-
ing 
in 
an 
official 
White 
House 
coronavirus briefing. Now, how the 
head of the CDC speaks in her personal 
capacity at an official White House 
coronavirus briefing on this topic, I 
don’t know, but that is what happened. 
The White House just keeps repeat-
ing these points that teachers should 
be a priority for vaccination. I don’t 
have a problem with that. I think that 
would be a great thing. It would make 
teachers more comfortable and might 
make parents more comfortable. In 
fact, when we were debating the budget 
resolution just a couple of weeks ago, I 
offered an amendment that would have 
incentivized school districts to get kids 
back to school after teachers had been 
vaccinated. That is more stringent 
than the President himself has said and 
more stringent than the CDC has said, 
but my amendment was blocked on a 
party-line vote. Every single Member 
of our friends on the other side voted 
against an amendment that would say 
we should incentivize, financially, get-
ting kids back to school when teachers 
have been vaccinated. 
Now, a couple of my friends on the 
other side walked up and said: Well, we 
just need to work this language a little 
bit because all of us that have kids 
know how important it is that we get 
our kids back to school. Democrats say 
we need emergency legislation to help 
the schools. I have been part of five 
bills that did that, and we provided 
$67.5 billion for K–12 schools to reopen 
safely. So far, States have spent just 
under $7 billion of that $67 billion, so 
clearly money is not the obstacle to 
getting back to school. 
The new plan would give an addi-
tional $128.6 billion for schools, accord-
ing to the CBO, and, again, only 5 per-
cent of that money would be spent by 
the end of this fiscal year, only about 
$6.5 billion. The rest of the money 
would be available over the next 7 
years. Hopefully, that money is not 
money that is designed to get kids 
back to school. We don’t need to be 
waiting 7 years to get kids back to 
school. 
If schools need money right now, 
they, first of all, should spend the 
money that the Congress has already 
provided. There is no reason to have 
over $60 billion still waiting to be spent 
if that is what it takes to get kids back 
to school. 
This probably isn’t about funding. It 
is really a discussion about whether 
the schools should reopen and what 
else we need to do with money that 
might be available right now because 
of this coronavirus legislation. 
We need to be sure we get back to 
school. Our goal should not be to keep 
the schools closed. If it is, why are we 
providing all this extra money so that 
schools can reopen, even though it will 
be a long time before that is spent? 
I started out my career, after college, 
as a high school history teacher and 
then later I was a university president. 
I know the challenges educators face 
every day and the ways well-meaning 
policy experts sometimes miss the re-
ality of the classroom. I also know that 
teachers are used to big challenges. 
They see them every day. They meet 
them every day. They do their best 
every day to overcome the challenges 
in front of them. Teachers want to help 
kids learn, and they don’t know what 
to do when they can’t have the contact 
they need to have with the kids. They 
know that kids won’t be doing as well 
as they need to do, in more cases than 
not, until they are back to school. 
In a recent Axios poll, teachers said 
they would return to school and are 
ready to do that. It is really time for a 
commonsense appraisal of what needs 
to be done to get kids back in school. 
This should not be something that we 
wait till next fall to do. It is something 
that needs to happen right now. 
The CDC guidelines are helpful, but 
they need to be more flexible. We need 
to constantly look at all the data. As 
people working hard to get kids back 
to school, we need to be sure that we 
understand where that is working, why 
that is working, how that is working, 
and we are getting that information 
out to school districts all over Amer-
ica. It is time to go back to school. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, the ex-
perts, the health officials, and the data 
have made it clear, we can and we 
should safely reopen our schools. But 
parents, 
students, 
and 
even 
some 
teachers are asking the question: Why 
have we failed to do that? 
There is a pretty simple answer. Poli-
ticians are putting political interests 
ahead of the livelihoods of our kids and 
of our families. According to the 
science presented by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 
schools can dust off their books and 
safely open up classrooms to students 
with commonsense precautions. 
Transmission of COVID among stu-
dents is relatively rare, and classrooms 
have not been a significant source of 
community transmission, according to 
the CDC. Furthermore, the CDC says 
‘‘it is possible for communities to re-
duce the incidence of COVID–19 while 
keeping schools open for in-person in-
struction.’’ 
So what is the holdup? Despite his 
CDC’s own advice, President Biden’s 
administration 
continues 
to 
play 
games, to ignore the science, and to 
send mixed messages to the American 
people. 
Their lack of clarity and their reluc-
tance to get students back in the class-
room is a detriment to our children, 
our working families, and our econ-
omy. 
Just recently, President Biden’s own 
CDC Director stated that the ‘‘vaccina-
tion of teachers is not’’—not—‘‘a pre-
requisite for safe reopening of schools’’ 
and that ‘‘there is increasing data to 
suggest that schools can safely re-
open.’’ But shortly after her statement, 
the 
White 
House 
Press 
Secretary 
moved the goalposts once again, claim-
ing that the Biden administration’s 
aim is to have more than 50 percent of 
the schools offer ‘‘some teaching’’ in 
person ‘‘at least one’’—one ‘‘day a 
week’’ by the 100th day of Joe Biden’s 
Presidency. One day a week, folks. Yes, 
you heard it right, have kids in school 
only one day per week and no sooner 
than the end of April. 
Just days after this, after coming 
under 
immense 
pressure 
from 
the 
American people, including folks on 
the left, the President moved the goal-
posts again and threw his communica-
tions staff under the bus—a school-
bus—for the one-day-a-week goal. 
Folks, our youngest generation is 
falling behind. Virtual learning does 
not give them the attention they need 
to be successful, and the isolation it 
creates has had an enormous impact on 
their mental health. 
But it is not just impacting our kids. 
The closure of schools and childcare 
centers 
has 
disproportionately 
im-
pacted 
women, 
most 
notably 
our 
moms. An analysis from the National 
Women’s Law Center found that 275,000 
women left the workforce in January 
alone, with many staying home to care

for their kids and often becoming their 
de facto teachers and tutors. 
Women across the country have made 
enormous strides in all fields of serv-
ice, and our moms shouldn’t be forced 
to put their careers on hold because 
our schools, at the direction of this ad-
ministration, are failing to do their 
jobs. 
In Iowa, because of Governor Rey-
nolds’ bold leadership, many of our 
kids have safely been back at school 
since August. The Iowa General Assem-
bly passed and the Governor signed leg-
islation to require safe in-person learn-
ing in our State’s public school system. 
Now the rest of the country needs to 
follow Iowa’s lead and get our kids 
safely back in the classroom. 
At the Federal level, I am helping 
lead an effort that would require 
schools to offer a safe in-person learn-
ing option to students by April 30, 2021. 
It is increasingly clear that the 
Biden administration, one that prides 
itself on following the science, is actu-
ally more loyal to leftwing special in-
terests than the well-being of our kids. 
Science, not special interests, should 
be guiding these decisions, and that 
means Washington should not be lock-
ing students out of the classroom. 
This type of meddling is precisely 
why I have always been leery of the 
overinvolvement of the Federal Gov-
ernment in education. So to get our bu-
reaucrats and special interests out of 
way and to put students first, I am 
helping lead that effort to require 
schools to offer safe in-person learning 
to our students by April 30, 2021. 
To guide us through this pandemic, I 
suggest we follow these revised and up-
dated three r’s of education: first, re-
spect the science; second, reopen our 
schools safely; and third, return stu-
dents, teachers, and learning to the 
classroom. 
It is long past time schools across 
the country follow the science and the 
data. Let’s do the right thing by safely 
getting our kids back in the classroom 
and help get our parents back to work. 
The well-being of our children, our 
working moms and dads, and our Na-
tion’s economy depend on it. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from the great 
State of Iowa for bringing forth her 
three r’s. I think they are very suc-
cinct. They are the message that cer-
tainly I want to convey with my col-
league from the great State of Florida 
here today: respect the science, reopen 
the schools safely, and return students, 
teachers, and learning to the class-
room. 
A year ago, we were only just start-
ing to realize what COVID–19 was 
about, almost a year to this date prac-
tically. Yet no one could have foreseen 
that many children would leave their 
classrooms in 2020 and still not have re-
turned in March of 2021. 
Fortunately, during these past few 
months, we have come a long way in 
our knowledge of COVID–19. We knew 
little about how the virus spread when 
most schools closed last March, but 
now experts have had the opportunity 
to learn more about the spread of the 
disease, specifically as it would spread 
in a K–12 school environment. 
At the end of January, the CDC, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, published data showing that 
in-person learning for K–12 students 
with limited in-school COVID–19 spread 
is, indeed, possible. The schools studied 
adhered to the public health practices 
many of us have followed—wearing a 
mask, 
social 
distancing, 
washing 
hands, avoiding large groups, and quar-
antining after exposure to the virus. 
Since this data was released, CDC has 
gone on and issued additional guidance 
for reopening our schools. This guid-
ance focuses on many of the same pub-
lic health strategies as well as cleaning 
facilities and additional ventilation. 
In addition to the improved knowl-
edge of how COVID–19 affects our 
schools, we also have safe and effective 
vaccines. By enabling our teachers and 
other education professionals to have 
the vaccine on a priority basis, we con-
tinue to forge ahead with reopening 
our schools. 
Yesterday, Dr. Clay Marsh, who is 
our State’s coronavirus czar—he has 
done an incredibly great job. He has 
also led our efforts in our successful 
vaccine efforts. And I want to remind 
the Nation that West Virginia is No. 1 
in vaccine distribution per capita. We 
have done a fantastic job. 
Dr. Marsh said yesterday: 
The classroom is a safe place to be. 
He continued by saying: 
The K–8 classroom—there is a tremendous 
amount of really good data to suggest that it 
is even a safer place to be than staying in 
your community. 
Following 
these 
comments, 
our 
State’s board of education voted in 
favor of our students in kindergarten 
through eighth grade returning to a 
full 5-day, in-person learning. It had 
some blended, some in class, and some 
at home. 
While data we have seen makes a 
very compelling case for why we can 
get children safely back into the class-
room with the right mitigations, other 
realities make it even more necessary. 
With the option of remote learning at 
home, there are still many children— 
especially in States like mine, West 
Virginia—who 
struggle 
with 
connectivity. Despite robust funding 
from Congress to attempt to address 
these issues, the digital divide is very 
real, and it begins to exacerbate the 
have-and-have-not phenomenon. As a 
result, these children can be affected 
for years. 
I hear concerns from parents all over 
my State. Last year, I had a Mercer 
County principal tell me that many of 
the students’ parents in their class had 
to drive their students to a parking lot 
of a fast food restaurant so they could 
get Wi-Fi so they could do their home-
work. 
A constituent from Lewis County re-
cently wrote to my office expressing 
her frustration with balancing her 
work with also the remote learning 
that her children are doing. To make 
matters worse, they can’t get on the 
internet at the same time in their 
home. 
Another parent from Berkeley Coun-
ty wrote to me with a heartbreaking 
story about how her daughter cries at 
the computer because she requires 
extra help on certain assignments. Par-
ents helping their children on school-
work can only go so far. In-person at-
tention is absolutely necessary and 
something that the internet can’t solve 
through a Zoom meeting or a video 
meeting or what a lot of this is—going 
to certain assignments on your com-
puter where there is nobody to interact 
with whatsoever. 
These are very real concerns that 
parents have, a fear that their children 
will fall behind and are falling behind 
without access to their schoolwork. 
Even more disturbing are the con-
cerns I have heard from child abuse ad-
vocates throughout our State. The 
heightened stress, school closures, loss 
of income, and social isolation from 
this pandemic have increased the risk 
of child abuse and neglect. Yet, with-
out the safe space of the school and the 
watchful eyes of our teachers and other 
caring professionals, I fear too many 
children are falling through the cracks 
and would have nowhere to turn. 
Last week, our West Virginia DHHR 
deputy secretary said there were 8,000 
fewer referrals to child protective serv-
ices this year in our State. Sadly, we 
know it is not because it is not occur-
ring; it is because teachers and school 
employees aren’t there to notice the 
abuse and neglect and report it. This is 
where our teachers are so incredibly 
caring and invaluable. 
According to data from the CDC, be-
tween April and October of 2020, emer-
gency departments nationwide have ex-
perienced a rise in the share of total 
visits from children with mental health 
needs. In my State of West Virginia, 
our State board of education has re-
ported a spike in attempted suicides in 
Cabell County. 
In addition, parents have had to 
make hard decisions as they attempt 
to balance their careers with their chil-
dren’s education, especially more dif-
ficult for those parents of younger chil-
dren who can’t leave their child at 
home for any period of time as they are 
doing their schoolwork. 
As more workers are being asked to 
physically return to their workplaces, 
the lack of in-person learning and ade-
quate childcare is hindering many from 
returning to work. This is especially 
true for many women who work out-
side the home. In fact, many women 
are having to quit their jobs as a re-
sult. 
According to data from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the January jobs re-
port showed that some 275,000 women

left the workforce, while about 71,000 
men left the workforce. Overall, ap-
proximately 2.4 million women have 
left the workforce since last February. 
This has been a common and unfortu-
nate trend we are seeing as a result of 
the pandemic, and I know for certain it 
is definitely tied to the fact that 
schools have not reopened. 
West Virginia’s State superintendent 
said recently: 
There is absolutely no substitution for a 
teacher in the lives of a child. 
He continued by saying: 
There is no substitution for what that 
means to the community and the families— 
not just for the academics but for the social, 
emotional, [and] physical well-being. 
He is absolutely right, and this is 
just another reason why it is so impor-
tant for our children to return to 
school safely. 
At the same time, I know there is no 
one-size-fits-all solution. State leaders, 
local governments, school administra-
tors, and parents must take this data 
and these recommendations and apply 
them to the realities they see in their 
own communities. 
Congress has provided $68 billion in 
resources for K–12 schools that they 
could use last year, which schools 
could use to implement these strate-
gies. For these, this may mean con-
tinuing some form of remote learning. 
For others, including my State of West 
Virginia, it means bringing every K–8 
student to a 5-day school week. 
Before I conclude, I want to take a 
moment to thank the teachers, the 
parents, and the students who have ad-
justed and readjusted over the past 
years. 
Despite the many challenges—wheth-
er they are technical, logistical, or 
emotional challenges—you have tried 
to make it work the best you can, and 
for that we are all very grateful. But 
now we have to do the three r’s. We 
must look at the data, listen to the 
stories, and look at the realities in our 
classrooms and in our communities. 
Get our children back to school. Re-
spect the science. Reopen the schools 
safely, and return students, teachers, 
and learning to the classroom, where it 
should be. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DUR-
BIN). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I first want to thank my colleague 
from West Virginia and my colleague 
from Iowa for their focus on getting 
our kids back in school. 
I agree with the three r’s: respect the 
science, reopen our schools safely, and 
return our teachers and our children to 
our classrooms. 
It has been almost a year since 
schools first shuttered due to COVID– 
19. In many States across the Nation, 
unfortunately, schools remain closed. 
The 
consequences 
are 
devastating. 
Being forced to stay at home is taking 
a significant social and emotional toll, 
and it also directly impacts our chil-
dren’s future. 
Continuing to subject kids to this un-
necessary virtual-learning system is 
not backed by science or facts. I ap-
plaud my State of Florida for getting 
schools reopened quickly and safely. 
The science is overwhelming and 
clear about reopening our Nation’s 
schools. It is safe, and it is necessary 
for the well-being and the future of stu-
dents. The CDC confirmed last month 
that in-person instruction does not 
pose an increased risk of community 
transmission. Schools can and should 
be open, and they can do so safely. 
We need to be honest about why we 
are even having this conversation 
today. The only reason schools across 
the Nation remain closed is because my 
Democratic colleagues and the Biden 
administration 
are 
standing 
with 
teachers unions instead of standing up 
for our children. 
For months, we have heard Demo-
crats 
preach 
about 
following 
the 
science, but now Democrats don’t want 
to acknowledge the scientific evidence 
that school reopenings are safe. They 
are blindly following the teachers 
unions because they are afraid of losing 
campaign contributions, and they are 
pushing a lie that schools can’t reopen 
without more taxpayer money. 
Here is the truth: The funding they 
claim 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
for 
schools to reopen would not even be al-
located for 2 or 3 years. According to 
the 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office, 
Biden’s COVID spending bill would dis-
tribute only $6.4 billion to K–12 schools 
this year. The remaining $122 billion 
would be spent between the years 2022 
and 2028. 
Here is another fact: Congress has al-
ready provided $68 billion for K–12 
schools, but so far States have spent 
just $4 billion of that money. Schools 
don’t need more money to open safely. 
Yet the Biden administration keeps 
clinging to this lie and doing every-
thing possible to keep schools closed. 
Last week, Speaker PELOSI said: 
We want as many kids to be back in school 
as possible. For that to happen, it takes 
some money. 
Also last week, Vice President HAR-
RIS would not directly answer whether 
it is safe for teachers to go back to 
school if they are not vaccinated, de-
spite clear CDC guidelines that it is 
not a prerequisite if other safety meas-
ures are in place. 
And earlier this month, all 50 Senate 
Democrats voted against students safe-
ly returning to classrooms even after 
teachers have been vaccinated. We all 
agree that teachers should be able to 
receive vaccinations. I will work with 
any of my colleagues on a way to get 
vaccines to teachers more quickly. 
We all agree that schools should have 
additional resources to ensure our stu-
dents and teachers have safe, clean, 
and healthy classrooms, and we have 
allocated $68 billion to do just that 
right now. But keeping schools closed 
doesn’t make sense. It is hurting our 
children and America’s poorest fami-
lies the most. 
I grew up in a poor family that strug-
gled to make ends meet, and education 
was life-changing for me, just as it is 
for families across our great country. 
Every student in this Nation deserves 
the option of in-person learning. 
It is time for the Biden administra-
tion to acknowledge that the best place 
for children to learn is in the class-
room, and it is time for my Democratic 
colleagues and the President to stop 
putting union bosses ahead of Amer-
ica’s students and families. 
Let’s get our schools open now. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today, as I have done 
twice before over the past month, to 
sound the alarm about the new admin-
istration’s attacks on American en-
ergy. Yet there is still more to talk 
about. 
President Biden has continued this 
assault on American energy as well as 
the American economy. Now he is tak-
ing that attack further. He is taking 
the attack on energy around the world 
as well as attacking the needs for en-
ergy of a number of our allies around 
the world. President Biden signed an 
Executive order to cut off all loans for 
coal, oil, and gas projects in some of 
the poorest nations in the world. 
Now, some of these nations are our 
friends that we work with and we try 
to help, and these are people who des-
perately need affordable energy, and 
they don’t have it. 
Democrats close to the administra-
tion have reported that what the ad-
ministration and President Biden are 
trying to do is to ‘‘isolate’’ the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
thinks 
that by refusing to make these loans to 
folks around the world, that the Chi-
nese Communist Party will be shamed 
for using fossil fuels for energy and will 
shame the Communist Party of China 
for loans that they make to countries 
to develop coal-fired powerplants, nat-
ural gas plants, and other projects that 
use fossil fuel. 
Let me tell you, the Chinese Com-
munist Party will not be shamed. 
China has a totalitarian regime; China 
puts Uighurs in concentration camps. 
So I am not sure what makes President 
Biden and his administration think 
that the Chinese Communist Party will 
be ashamed of using an affordable reli-
able source of energy—coal. 
In reality, President Biden, by this 
Executive order, is giving China a gift. 
President Biden is giving China an-
other advantage on the world stage and 
putting ourselves at a disadvantage, if 
you think about it. 
If the United States and those that 
we fund through the World Bank refuse 
to provide loans to those countries to 
build the powerplants that they need, 
that is going to leave a vacuum. They 
are going to need to use the resources 
that they have—if they have plenty of 
coal or natural gas—and the Chinese 
Communist Party is going to come in 
and make the loan. 
China already funds 7 out of 10 new 
coal plants around the world, and 
thanks to President Biden’s misguided 
effort, that is likely soon going to be 
close to 10 out of 10. 
Just like President Biden’s other en-
ergy orders, this new policy will make 
China stronger. It will make America 
weaker. China will have more influ-
ence, and the United States will have 
less. 
Now, this order is not going to hurt 
China at all. The people whom it will 
hurt are those who look to the United 
States for help and for friendship. It is 
going to especially hurt the 840 million 
people around the world who don’t 
have access to electricity today. 
Developing 
countries 
desperately 
need the electricity. They need it to be 
affordable. They need it to be reliable. 
So if you help developing countries in 
terms of helping them get a stable sup-
ply of energy, it is one of the best 
things we can do to help people around 
the world in their fight against pov-
erty. 
Many parts of the world, countries 
with abundant energy resources, just 
need our help and turn to us for our 
help so they can use the resources that 
they have. 
And let me give you a good example, 
Madam President, because you and I 
have traveled to various places around 
the world and had a chance to see men 
and women in uniform and thank them 
for their services, as we have done, and 
gone to battlefields, as we have had 
family members who have served in the 
military and defended this country and 
our freedoms. And it has been a pleas-
ure to be able to do that with you and 
share that with your family because of 
our united heritage of fighting or our 
family history of fighting for the coun-
try. 
So a good example of what I am talk-
ing about is Kosovo. I have been there 
on three separate occasions specifically 
to visit members of our troops—the 
men and women in uniform, people 
from Wyoming who are serving in 
Kosovo. I have been there three sepa-
rate times. I was there in 2019, was 
there previously for Thanksgiving, was 
there on Easter Sunday one time to be 
with the troops. 
Well, Kosovo is one of the poorest na-
tions in Europe, but it has vast energy 
resources. Despite being physically 
smaller than the State of Connecticut, 
Kosovo has the fifth largest reserves of 
coal in the world: small geography, 
massive resources of coal. 
So the World Bank has cut off 
Kosovo’s funding for a new state-of- 
the-art coal-fired powerplant. They 
have old coal-fired powerplants. They 
are burning coal right now. 
I have talked to the leaders of the 
country, and they say: We need to 
build a new coal-fired powerplant. We 
need to borrow the money to do it. 
Well, the World Bank has said it is 
only going to support new energy 
projects from renewable sources. So 
this is what Kosovo’s Minister of Eco-
nomic Development is saying. He said: 
‘‘In a poor country [like] Kosovo . . . 
we don’t have the luxury . . .’’—the 
luxury of focusing only on renewable 
sources when they don’t have that 
much access to renewable energy. The 
wind doesn’t blow that much; in terms 
of sunny days, not at all during the 
winter, and they have this incredible 
resource of coal. 
Well, the Minister of Economic De-
velopment is absolutely correct—be-
cause I have been there in the spring; I 
have been there in the winter; I have 
been there different times throughout 
the year. Developing countries cannot 
afford the elitist environmental agen-
das of Presidents who become climate 
elitists, especially those being put in 
charge of those issues, former Sec-
retary of State John Kerry. 
Let me repeat myself so—I want to 
just make this absolutely clear: We, 
the United States, have peacekeeping 
troops in the country of Kosovo. We 
have them right there in Kosovo. And 
we, the United States, are driving the 
Government of Kosovo into the clutch-
es of the Communist Chinese Party be-
cause of a holier-than-thou attitude of 
the climate alarmists in the White 
House. 
So we pay to put our troops on the 
ground, and then we say: Go to China if 
you need help providing power to your 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

February 24, 2021 
People need affordable, reliable en-
ergy. Traditional energy projects are 
still the most affordable, still the most 
reliable. 
If we really care about the people in 
developing countries, then we ought to 
help them turn on the lights. So I urge 
the Biden administration to reverse 
course, to rethink this, to look at all 
the implications of the decisions they 
are making. 
We need to stop this senseless attack 
on energy jobs. We need to stop this 
reckless attack on developing nations. 
We need to stop pushing our allies into 
the waiting arms of the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
The American people and our friends 
around the world—we are better than 
what we are getting right now from 
this administration, and we need to re-
verse course. 
I yield the floor.

BIG TECH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
last week I held 12 meetings in Iowa. 
Those meetings are for the purpose of 
having dialogue with my constituents, 
mostly answering their questions. As 
many of my colleagues know, I hold 
face-to-face meetings with Iowans in 
all 99 counties every year. It has been 
a privilege to get to every county in 
every corner of the State every single 
year for the past four decades. 
People have asked me why I do this. 
The simple answer is, in our system of 
self-government, I am one half of a rep-
resentative government; my constitu-
ents are the other half. My county 
meetings are a good way for me to keep 
in touch and see for myself the chal-
lenges and successes going on in com-
munities across my home State. In re-
cent years, it has become an important 
way for me to counter disinformation, 
correct misinformation, and sidestep 
censorship that Americans digest daily 
in the mainstream and social media. 
Big tech and big data companies, 
much like State surveillance and Big 
Brother, share something in common: 
If left unchecked, Big Tech can under-
mine the privacy, civil liberties, and 
constitutional 
freedoms 
that 
every 
American 
should 
hold 
sacred 
and 
should never take for granted. 
Responsible 
digital 
citizenship 
is 
more important now than ever, par-
ticularly with the censuring that is 
going on. Consumers must be mindful 
about their digital footprint. Anything 
typed into a search engine is effec-
tively a digital diary, saved in the 
cloud for some rainy day. Consumers 
must be mindful about what is posted, 
what is downloaded, what is shared, 
and what is liked on social media plat-
forms. 
The road to responsible and account-
able digital citizenship isn’t solely the 
consumer’s 
responsibility. 
Social 
media companies, as well as content 
and internet providers, are not exempt 
from ethical corporate stewardship, es-
pecially when the welfare of the next 
generation is at stake. Keep in mind 
that human trafficking is a pervasive 
crime that grooms and blackmails 
young people on Main Street but also 
in online communications. 
However, having said all those ques-
tion marks about Big Tech, I think we 
all realize that Big Tech isn’t all bad. 
Technology companies have revolu-
tionized our way of life and how we 
connect with friends and family. Dur-
ing the pandemic—and we are still in 
that pandemic—technology delivered 
invaluable 
connections 
for 
e-com-
merce, for digital learning, for tele-
working, and for telehealth. However, 
that doesn’t give big tech and big data 
companies license to undermine con-
stitutional protections or disregard 
harmful impacts their products and 
services have on civic life and public 
trust in our American democracy. Ti-
tans of technology need to take respon-
sibility for the products they build, 
sell, and profit from fellow Americans. 
Policymakers and regulators have a 
duty to shape and enforce the rules of 
the road. Big Tech and all of its stake-
holders, from content makers, social 
media platforms, and internet service 
providers, all bear responsibility to un-
derstand how their business model puts 
freedom at risk. Red flags are popping 
up all over the digital frontier, from re-
curring data breaches to online censor-
ship, misuse of user profiles, and the 
recent mess with an online brokerage 
app. 
In the last two Presidential elec-
tions, Big Tech has had a big influence 
on information that appeared or didn’t 
appear in Americans’ social media 
feeds. 
Big Tech can’t hide behind its busi-
ness model when its revenue streams 
cash in on an infrastructure that sows 
division and distrust among Ameri-
cans. This ecosystem has been ex-
ploited to radicalize political extre-
mism and mobilize civil unrest. Social 
media companies have reaped the bene-
fits of their enterprise, so these compa-
nies bear some responsibility to help 
repair cracks in the architecture of our 
civic institutions and also to heal the 
wounds festering in American life. 
Our economic freedom allows social 
media companies to create a business 
model that grows their bottom line. 
Americans need to understand their 
personal data is harvested for profit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S846 
February 24, 2021 
Advertisers buy the data to influence 
consumer and voter behavior. The bot-
tom line for every American ought to 
be ensuring that constitutional protec-
tions aren’t archived—out of sight, out 
of mind—in the annals of history. 
I am not saying Big Tech is a bad 
actor, but I am calling on Big Tech to 
be a good actor. Take responsibility for 
the online ecosystem you created. 
Congress also must take a good, hard 
look at this famous section 230 we all 
talk about that has given these plat-
forms great protection—more protec-
tion than they probably deserve—and 
whether, in regard to section 230, there 
is a need to reform immunity laws on 
the books. I think there is great reason 
to do that. 
We have seen what happens when 
conversations take place online versus 
in person. Take it from me. The tone of 
conversation was neighborly and civil 
when I talked with these Iowans last 
week in Forest City, IA, or Ogden, IA, 
to answer their questions. However 
civil that is, it is sure offset by the in-
civility on these platforms. Incivility 
outflanks kindness, I think, tenfold in 
the responses posted on my Twitter ac-
count. 
We need to work together to heal the 
unholy civil divide that has taken root 
online. It is bleeding into our way of 
life, pitting neighbor against neighbor, 
and harming the ability of elected 
leaders to build bipartisan consensus 
for the public good. 
I am here to put social media plat-
forms, the mainstream media, Con-
gress, and the American public on no-
tice: The digital landscape needs a 
reboot. What we do with this space will 
influence how young people participate 
in civic and political life for genera-
tions to come. 
So, in closing, in the coming days, I 
am going to have more conversations 
with my colleagues on this through a 
series of speeches. I will be talking 
more about social and mainstream 
media, censorship, and freedom of 
speech, particularly on college cam-
puses.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, each 
February, we mark Black History 
Month by coming together to highlight 
the achievements and contributions of 
Black Americans to our national story 
and remember the centuries of struggle 
that have shaped our society. 
At every turning point in American 
history, Black American achievements 
and calls to action have driven our Na-
tion’s cultural, economic, and social 
progress forward, helping to hold to ac-
count the promises of freedom and 
equality for all people that our found-
ing doctrine failed to uphold. 
For too long, this history and the 
names and faces of those who marched, 
sacrificed, and fought for change have 
been obscured by prejudice and hate. It 
is our charge to remember those who 
marched for justice and the forces they 
marched against. 
When we ignore the injustices of our 
past, we cannot make amends in the 
present. The consequences of such inac-
tion are grave and live on in present 
day: the ongoing racial and religious 
profiling, brutality, and killing of 
Black Americans by police; the high 
rates of COVID–19 transmission and 
death in Black communities; and the 
disproportionate impact this current 
economic crisis has had on Black work-
ers and Black-owned businesses. 
The unemployment rate for Black 
workers reached 9.9 percent, for in-
stance—far beyond the national aver-
age of 6.7 percent, according to the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics. 
These issues, including the broader 
economic and health consequences of 
the pandemic, result from systemic 
failures in place far before the current 
crisis, and they threaten to worsen ra-
cial gaps in wealth, health outcomes, 
and opportunities for years to come. 
Last year, our Nation’s fight against 
racism gained new urgency by a police 
officer’s 
callous 
killing 
of 
George 
Floyd in May. The Trump administra-
tion and law enforcement’s response to 
peaceful protests further displayed the 
double standard that still exists in our 
society today. Protesters were at-
tacked with tear gas and rubber bullets 
across the Nation and here in our cap-
ital as they organized and marched to 
make it known that Black lives mat-
ter. We watched on television as the 
National 
Guard 
forcefully 
removed 
peaceful 
protesters 
from 
Lafayette 
Park to make way for President Trump 
to walk to St. John’s Episcopal Church 
for a photo op. President Trump bran-
dished a Bible in front of the church 
while he continued to fan the flames of 
bigotry, hate, and racism. 
The historic election of KAMALA HAR-
RIS as our Nation’s first Black female 
Vice President serves as a reminder of 
the power of collective action. The 
Biden-Harris administration gives us 
opportunity to take meaningful action 
in government to create a more just so-
ciety. In the year ahead, we must work 
together to advance the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act to bring ac-
countability to law enforcement and 
the JOHN LEWIS Voting Rights Act to 
combat voter suppression and restore 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
It is our charge to mobilize all levels, 
from our communities to the Oval Of-
fice, to advance social, economic, and 
civil rights and justice to all Ameri-
cans. It is time to expel all remaining 
vestiges of slavery and White suprem-
acy that continue to plague our Na-
tion. 
As our National Youth Poet Laureate 
Amanda Gorman said so eloquently in 
her inaugural day address, ‘‘[B]eing 
American is more than [just] a pride 
we inherit, it’s the past we step into 
and how we repair it.’’ Black History 
Month is a reminder to look to this 
past and to act on our responsibilities 
in the present to make our Nation a 
better place for all of us. 
We are still fighting against the 
vestiges of the institutions of slavery, 
of targeted violence and resistance in 
the Reconstruction and the Jim Crow 
eras, and of the tactics to keep Black 
Americans from the polls and out of 
government. 
They are not merely footnotes in our 
history textbooks; they are the lineage 
of our Nation, the obstacles that have 
left millions of our citizens behind in 
the effort to obtain the American 
dream. 
The realization of justice and true 
equality depends on our work to build 
a country committed to righting his-
toric wrongs, closing gaps in the oppor-
tunity to achieve, and dismantling 
vestiges of inequality in our founda-
tions. The 28 days in February must set 
the tone for the entire year—a contin-
ued commitment to justice, equality, 
and opportunity. 
Celebrating Black experiences and 
culture contributes to the greatness of 
our diverse society. Such a celebration 
is aspirational, highlighting one of the 
many fundamental components that 
make this Nation a beacon around the 
world despite our flaws. 
For the past 40 years, House Majority 
Leader STENY HOYER celebrated Black 
History Month by hosting a breakfast 
for political and civic leaders and in-
viting illustrious keynote speakers. 
Past speakers included then-Senator 
Barack Obama and Congressman John 
Lewis. Congressman ANTHONY BROWN 
joined the effort to bring so many of us 
together for this 40th Annual Black 
History Month Celebration and fea-
tured Vice President Harris as the hon-
ored guest and keynote speaker. 
I would like to acknowledge the plan-
ning committee for this year’s event, 
including Jackie Rhone and the former 
chair, Betty Richardson. Through their 
hard work, the celebration is a true 
success that everyone who participates 
looks forward to year after year. 
This year’s event focused on the iden-
tity, representation, and diversity of 
the Black family. Maya Angelou once 
said: 
I sustain myself with the love of my fam-
ily. 
The lasting bonds we have with our 
families sustain us through life. For 
many, our families serve as our home 
base through times of triumph, trial, 
and tragedy. 
The past year was a tumultuous year, 
from the COVID–19 pandemic, which 
has disproportionately harmed African 
Americans much more severely than 
others, to the resounding calls for ra-
cial justice and racial equity, which 
have long been overdue. Through all of 
the turmoil, 2020 brought us together 
to appreciate and celebrate the gifts of 
life, family, and diversity. As we cele-
brate Black History Month and moving 
forward, we can recommit ourselves to 
promoting and celebrating diversity 
and advancing civil rights in our soci-
ety. Black history is American history. 
It is a story of oppression, struggle, 
and, if we are to be true to our found-
ing premise, redemption and equality.

REOPENING SCHOOLS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I know that some of my col-
leagues 
have 
been 
talking 
about 
schools, 
getting 
children 
back 
to 
school, getting schools reopened. In-
deed, in Tennessee, that is a topic that 
has received a good bit of conversation. 
All but two of our school systems have 
been open and working this entire 
school year, and those other two sys-
tems have recently reopened since the 
first of the year. Our school super-
intendents, our directors of school, our 
parents, our teachers, and the students 
have all worked together as a team—a 
solid, cohesive team—to make this 
happen. 
I think there are two main points 
that we have seen, and as we are hold-
ing meetings with our county elected 
officials and city officials and as they 
talk about the efforts that they have 
made in getting children back into the 
classroom, we hear a lot about one 
point. That is that our Governor, Ten-
nessee Governor Bill Lee, made it clear 
that the school districts would be re-
sponsible for the ‘‘how’’ they were 
going to open and the ‘‘when’’ they 
would be reopening. I really thank him 
for listening and recognizing that local 
officials and individuals in the commu-
nity really do know what is best for 
their school districts and their stu-
dents. 
The second point is that these plans 
didn’t just drop out of the sky. As I 
said, this has been a team effort in our 
communities, and it has happened be-
cause there was this agreement be-
tween the administrators and the par-
ents and the teachers that they were 
going to make decisions that were 
going to be best for the children. So 
when you look at Tennessee and how 
they have approached this—indeed, the 
schools reopening and how they pro-
ceeded—it was done with the children 
in mind. 
Last week, I had the privilege of 
speaking with school administrators 
from West Tennessee, who played a 
part in developing their own reopening 
plans. I cannot adequately describe to 
you with the time that we have on the 
floor today the amount of work and the 
thoughtfulness that they put into these 
schedules, from health and safety con-
siderations, to scheduling changes, to 
the complicated logistics of social 
distancing and cramped classrooms. 
They thought it all through by walking 
through the day and listening to what 
teachers and parents had to say as to 
how they would walk through this day. 
They took the millions of dollars in 
CARES Act funding that the area re-
ceived, and what did they do with that 
money? They invested in the best pos-
sible plan for these kids—no Federal 
mandate or sweeping litmus test re-
quired. They said: We are going to do 
what is right by these children. 
Then, of course, they turned on the 
TV, and they saw that the Biden ad-
ministration was busy walking back 
their own enthusiastic scientific guid-
ance on safely reopening schools— 
walking it back—and they didn’t have 
to flip too many channels to figure out 
why. Powerful teachers unions had 
taken their own stands in refusing to 
make a plan, in refusing to think 
things through, and in some cases in 
refusing to go to work at all—not doing 
what is best for the children but doing 
what was going to serve their interests 
first and, in their opinions, what would 
best serve their interests. That, I 
think, they will see were regrettable 
actions. 
Educators in Tennessee were not just 
confused by what they saw; they were 
insulted because they knew exactly 
what was happening. On January 26, 
CDC officials released a study showing 
that, if we were careful, safe reopening 
was indeed possible. Administration of-
ficials touted that report as a light at 
the end of a very long COVID pan-
demic, but now, just a few weeks later, 
those same officials are defying their 
own experts, insisting that safe reopen-
ing can only happen if Congress ap-
proves additional funding contained in 
the 
Democrats’ 
latest, 
untargeted 
spending bill. 
Students in this country are suf-
fering. They are lonely, they are bored, 
and many of them are struggling with 
clinical depression and anxiety. Teen 
pregnancy, teen alcohol, and suicide 
rates are rising. Children need to be in 
in-person school. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
has repeatedly stated—bear in mind, 
this isn’t something that I am saying; 
it isn’t something that is partisan; it is 
the American Academy of Pediatrics— 
that it is not only feasible but nec-
essary for students to be back in 
school, back in the classroom, back to 
seeing their friends, back to partici-
pating in extracurricular activities and 
sports. 
I would ask my colleagues across the 
aisle to keep this in mind when they 
hear from so-called stakeholders who 
are willing to hold a child’s mental 
health hostage in exchange for a polit-
ical win that will serve their power and 
their purposes and not that of the 
child’s. They might have powerful 
voices in the cable news circuit, but 
those sound bites will provide you no 
cover back home with the teachers and 
administrators who have rolled up 
their sleeves, have gotten to work, and 
have figured out a way to get schools 
open for the children. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, out-
rage—that is what American families 
should be feeling right now, and many 
are. We are seeing President Biden and 
the Democrats support opening the 
border, the southern border, for illegal 
immigrants while bowing to political 
pressure and keeping many of our Na-
tion’s schools closed for our students— 
opening the southern border for illegal 
immigrants, 
closing 
our 
Nation’s 
schools for our students. 
Schools across the Nation remain 
closed to in-person instruction largely 
due to teachers unions and their influ-
ence on many of our local and Federal 
leaders on the other side of the aisle— 
all, unfortunately, to the detriment of 
the education and the health of our 
students. 
In States and localities where schools 
remain closed, America’s youngest and 
brightest minds are posed with chal-
lenges that generations before have 
never dealt with. Children are con-
tinuing to cope with the unprecedented 
hardship of virtual classrooms, a lack 
of social interaction with their peers, 
and other impediments to their edu-
cation. But this isn’t because of the 
pandemic itself; it is because President 
Biden, the Democrats, and local leaders 
have caved to the political pressures of 
teachers unions and have kept many 
classrooms closed and students at 
home 
despite 
what 
the 
available 
science and other experts are telling 
us. The science is clear: Schools are 
not major COVID–19 spreading grounds, 
and younger students are a low-risk 
group. Studies indicate that students 
across the country are months behind 
where they should be academically. 
The hardships our students face go 
beyond academics because the mental 
and physical health of children has also 
taken a toll. We are seeing depression 
and anxiety rates skyrocket among our 
young people. I was on a call today, a 
Zoom call, with several elementary 
school principals in Montana, hearing 
their firsthand, frankly, tragic ac-
counts of what is happening with the 
mental health of our students in ele-
mentary school and hearing about ele-
mentary school students assaulting 
teachers. A whole year without full- 
time, in-person learning has done irrep-
arable damage. The status quo is truly 
devastating to many of our students. 
Despite this—despite the science, de-
spite the overwhelming data—schools 
across the country, in many parts of 
our country, remain closed. 
Frankly, it is unacceptable that 
many of my colleagues across the aisle 
and 
the 
Biden 
administration 
are 
standing by while this happens to our 
students across our country. They have 
chosen to play politics with our Na-
tion’s students instead of ensuring that

S848 
February 24, 2021 
our children are getting the very best 
education possible, which is full-time, 
in-person instruction. They are intent 
on jamming through this partisan $1.9 
trillion COVID package, which does in-
clude billions of dollars for schools. 
Incidentally, in working together, we 
have passed five bipartisan COVID re-
lief packages. Yes, it is harder to work 
in a bipartisan fashion, but that is why 
we were sent back here to Wash-
ington—to work together. Yet Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats are say-
ing: We are going to do this one alone. 
It is going to be their way or the high-
way. 
The sad reality is, the more the 
American people hear what is in this 
$1.9 trillion package, the more they are 
not going to like it. Most of the money 
in this package is not to be spent now. 
In fact, 95 percent of it will be spent 
over the next 7 years, after the crisis. 
We should not use this COVID crisis as 
a liberal wish list of items here where-
in 95 percent of it gets spent in the out- 
years. How does this help our students 
and our schools now? The answer is, it 
doesn’t. 
This is not how we solve the prob-
lems that our students are facing. For-
tunately, there is a pretty simple solu-
tion. It is this: Listen to the experts. 
Listen to the science. Reopen our 
schools, and let’s get our students back 
in the classroom. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
TEXAS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we 
have had some bizarre weather in my 
State in the last week or so. We are 
still reeling from a deadly winter 
storm that hit all 254 counties in the 
State of Texas last week. 
The snowstorm brought snow, ice, 
and prolonged subfreezing tempera-
tures. We don’t have temperatures 
below zero in Texas—or at least we 
haven’t for a long, long time, but we 
did last week. As a result, it paralyzed 
much of our critical infrastructure, 
leaving millions without electricity, 
leaving them without heat, and leaving 
them without running water for days 
on end. 
The good news is that power has now 
been restored for the vast majority of 
Texans, and cities are slowly lifting 
water boil notices as water filtration 
systems come back online. 
But a number of families are still 
facing outages, and as we have seen 
during previous disasters, low-income 
and minority communities are the 
hardest hit. Our top priority is to re-
store power and clean water to every 
single Texan. 
Throughout this episode—this trag-
edy, really—my staff and I have been in 
contact with local, State, and, of 
course, Federal officials to determine 
what kinds of things we can do to help 
and how we can mobilize resources as 
soon as possible. As recovery efforts 
continue in the coming days and 
weeks, I will continue to try to do 
that. 
This is not unlike what we have to do 
periodically for hurricanes that seem 
to find their way to the State of Texas. 
But in this case we know that some of 
the problem was not an act of nature; 
it was a failure to anticipate these sub-
freezing, subzero cold temperatures. So 
we have got to ask not only ‘‘What 
happened?’’ but ‘‘How can we prevent it 
from happening again in the future?’’ 
As I said, we experience, from time to 
time, hurricanes, occasionally torna-
does and tropical storms or record-low 
temperatures, but we cannot allow our 
infrastructure to go offline for days on 
end. 
I want to thank the countless Texans 
who supported each other during this 
crisis. There are those that have gone 
above and beyond the call of duty in 
their official capacities, whether it is 
as first responders, emergency dis-
patchers, utility and energy workers, 
healthcare workers—the list goes on 
and on. 
But there are also the unsung he-
roes—those who invited neighbors into 
their homes, delivered hot meals to 
those in need, checked on an elderly 
neighbor, those who towed vehicles 
stuck in the snow, and so much more. 
I just want to assure all of my con-
stituents that we are in this together, 
and we will do everything we can not 
only to find out how this happened but 
what we can do to make sure it never 
happens again. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, as you know, this week our Demo-
cratic colleagues in the House are con-
tinuing to take action on President 
Biden’s relief bill, using the budget rec-
onciliation process. 
It is really not so much an issue in 
the House, where you can do anything 
you want, basically, with a majority 
vote. But if all goes their way, our 
Democratic colleagues will write a $1.9 
trillion check, funded by taxpayers— 
future taxpayers because it will be bor-
rowed money—without the input of a 
single Republican in Congress, either 
in the House or in the Senate. 
We know that there are 10 Repub-
licans who went over to the White 
House, had a very pleasant meeting 
with President Biden, but were essen-
tially told: My way or the highway. 
Any effort to try to come up with a bi-
partisan compromise was rejected. 
Regardless of your political affili-
ation or views on this particular bill, 
that fact alone should trouble every 
single American. After all, there was 
no need for partisan maneuvering to 
pass a coronavirus relief bill last year. 
As a matter of fact, we passed five of 
them. All of them were signed into law 
with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
No bill received fewer than 90 votes 
here in the Senate. One even passed 
unanimously. 
Of course, the reason for the wide-
spread support wasn’t because Mem-
bers thought these relief packages were 
perfect. There were things I would have 
changed if I had had a chance, and I am 
sure others would have made other 
changes. 
But each bill was a clear response to 
the crisis at hand and free from any 
unrelated partisan priorities. In other 
words, it was focused on COVID–19 re-
lief. 
Suffice it to say that the same can-
not be said about this latest piece of 
legislation, this $1.9 trillion bill being 
rammed 
through 
Congress 
by 
our 
Democratic colleagues. 
Overall, I have three concerns with 
this legislation. First, it would dra-
matically overspend in areas that 
aren’t even in need of additional fund-
ing. 
In the early days of the pandemic, we 
had no real expectation about how long 
the crisis would last or how big a blow 
it would deal to our economy. After the 
CARES Act was signed into law in 
March, late March, it made sense to hit 
the pause button so we could see how 
what we did was working—what was 
working well and what was not work-
ing so well. Where was more assistance 
needed? Where was it sufficient? 
These needs became obvious pretty 
quickly. One example was the Pay-
check Protection Program. Within 2 
weeks of passage of $350 billion worth 
of relief, it ran dry—in 2 weeks. So we 
quickly came together on a bipartisan 
basis to replenish the fund with addi-
tional money, and we did so again at 
the end of the year. 
This sort of bipartisan, step-by-step 
approach is the most effective way to 
get funding where it is needed without 
wasting money on already well-funded 
programs. 
But, 
unfortunately, 
our 
friends 
across the aisle didn’t apply that same 
logic to this $1.9 trillion piece of legis-
lation, which sends hundreds of billions 
of dollars to areas that are nowhere 
near running out of money. 
One example is public education. So 
far, Congress has provided more than 
$110 billion to support K–12 education, 
including $68 billion in the relief bill 
passed just in December. Schools in 
Texas have used this money to update 
their ventilation systems, purchase 
masks and personal protective equip-
ment, and make other investments in 
classroom safety. But the vast major-
ity of the funding that was provided in 
December is still waiting to be used. In 
other words, there is no current need 
for any more money from Congress. 
As a matter of fact, as of February 9, 
States have spent just under $5 billion 
of the $68 billion we have already pro-
vided for K–12 education. They have 
spent just $5 billion out of the $68 bil-
lion. 
As a reminder, in December, the 
CDC—the Centers for Disease Control— 
estimated schools would need only 
about $22 billion to reopen safely, 
meaning there is already more than 
enough money to support safe school 
reopenings. But that data-driven esti-
mate from the experts doesn’t seem to 
matter to our Democratic colleagues or 
the administration, who are preparing

S849 
February 24, 2021 
to drop another $130 billion for public 
education. So $5 billion has been spent 
out of the $68 billion we have already 
appropriated, and our Democratic col-
leagues now want to spend another $130 
billion. 
Since most of the existing funds re-
main to be spent, the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office estimates that 
the bulk of spending of this new pro-
posed funding would occur after this 
year, after 2021; that is, the majority of 
the funding in this new so-called 
COVID relief bill wouldn’t even be 
touched until, God willing, the pan-
demic is already in the rearview mir-
ror. 
I have advocated for funding to help 
our schools prepare for a safe return to 
the classroom, and the experts tell us 
that there is more than sufficient fund-
ing already out there to make that 
happen. So I am left to conclude, as I 
think most—really, any reasonable 
person would, that it is irresponsible to 
have taxpayers foot the bill for another 
$130 billion when there is no need for 
the funding. 
And this isn’t like we are spending 
money that we have. We are actually 
borrowing money from future genera-
tions, exacerbating an already huge 
Federal debt. 
That brings me to the second concern 
I have with this bill: It completely ig-
nores the trajectory of our economic 
recovery. 
At the start of the pandemic, we all 
know the economic hammer came 
down hard and fast. As States imposed 
lockdown measures, businesses closed 
their doors, people lost their jobs, and 
consumer spending plummeted. 
But as the pandemic has gone on, 
even the more moderate predictions 
about an economic depression have 
proven wrong. By any measure, our 
economy has recovered faster than any 
of us expected. That should be a posi-
tive thing. We should be happy about 
that. 
The unemployment rate has steadily 
declined, going from 14.8 percent in 
April to 6.3 percent last month. State 
tax revenues have largely rebounded. 
As a matter of fact, California has 
fared so well that it is adding money to 
their rainy day fund. In other words, 
they don’t need any more money. Their 
revenues have exceeded their revenues 
from years before the pandemic even 
hit. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office 
projects that the U.S. economy will re-
turn to its prepandemic size by the 
middle of this year, even if Congress 
doesn’t 
approve 
another 
penny 
of 
money. Let me say that again. The 
Congressional Budget Office projects 
the U.S. economy will return to its 
prepandemic size in the middle of this 
year—just a few months away—even if 
Congress does not approve any more 
Federal money to aid the recovery. 
Well, it is tough to reconcile that 
fact with the claim from our friends 
across the aisle that we need to spend 
another $1.9 trillion, money that we 
don’t have. 
Despite all the data that shows our 
economy is recovering, rebounding in a 
robust way, this bill sends another $350 
billion to State and local governments 
that are not facing the dire budget 
shortfalls that we worried about last 
March. And it is not without negative 
consequences. 
Larry Summers, who served as the 
Treasury Secretary during the Clinton 
administration and who was an eco-
nomic adviser to President Obama, of-
fered a good observation on the situa-
tion in a recent opinion piece. He 
wrote: 
[W]hereas the Obama stimulus was about 
half as large as the output shortfall, the pro-
posed Biden stimulus is three times as large 
as the projected shortfall. Relative to the 
size of the gap being addressed, it is six 
times as large. 
For this administration to make pub-
lic 
comments 
about 
following 
the 
science—certainly, following the facts, 
listening to the experts—it is hard to 
reconcile that with this bill that is so 
divorced from reality. I don’t think 
you can do it, which brings me to my 
third big concern with this bill: This is 
not a COVID–19 relief bill in its en-
tirety. It includes a range of com-
pletely 
unrelated, 
liberal 
priorities 
that should not be included in this 
emergency spending, let alone one that 
is rushed through in a partisan manner 
through the budget process. 
One case in point is the proposed in-
crease in the minimum wage to $15. Re-
gardless of the cost of living, busi-
nesses in small towns and major cities 
alike would be required to pay their 
employees $15 an hour by 2025. Now, for 
big companies in big cities, that may 
be doable. That may be the going rate 
to get the kind of quality workforce 
you want. As we know, companies like 
Amazon 
have 
already 
implemented 
their own $15 an hour minimum wage 
back in 2018, and they can afford it. But 
for small businesses that are the back-
bone of our economy and are key to 
our economic recovery following this 
pandemic, this could lead to massive 
layoffs or permanent closures. 
The Congressional Budget Office that 
I referred to earlier estimates that this 
provision alone could put 1.4 million 
Americans out of work. Do we really 
want to pass a provision that would put 
1.4 million Americans out of work? 
That is 50 percent more than it could 
potentially lift out of poverty. 
As a reminder, our colleagues are 
trying to rush this massive change 
through Congress as part of a pandemic 
relief bill because they know that it is 
the only shot at passing a bill that 
would have this sort of dramatic nega-
tive effect on jobs—all under the guise 
of economic relief and stimulus. There 
is simply no way to justify a one-size- 
fits-all mandate that treats Silicon 
Valley the same as it does mom-and- 
pop businesses in rural America. 
And the range of unrelated provisions 
doesn’t stop there. This legislation in-
cludes $30 billion for public transit 
agencies, a blank check to bail out 
mismanaged union pension funds with-
out any reforms, and funding for a 
bridge to connect the majority leader’s 
home State of New York to Canada. So 
we are going to build the majority 
leader a bridge to Canada as part of an 
emergency COVID–19 relief bill. It is 
outrageous. Everyone remembers the 
infamous earmark now known as the 
bridge to nowhere. At least in this case 
we know where the bridge will end up. 
But a pandemic relief bill should not 
serve as a Trojan horse in order to pur-
sue such parochial and local desires or 
any other part of an unrelated liberal 
wish list. 
So the Biden bill of $1.9 trillion actu-
ally creates more problems than it 
solves or it tries to solve nonexistent 
problems. It drives up our national 
debt by spending money that experts 
say is not needed. It ignores the data— 
the facts about our economic recov-
ery—and it creates even more prob-
lems, all in the name of securing a win 
for the administration and our Demo-
cratic colleagues. It is as though this 
bill were drafted in a vacuum with no 
attention paid to what has already 
been done, how things are going, or 
what we anticipate the need will be in 
the future. 
If the evidence and the experts tell us 
that more funding is needed to bolster 
our response to the virus, I will be one 
of the first people to advocate for addi-
tional targeted relief. But this race to 
spend money for the sake of spending 
money and ignore what the experts are 
saying is absolutely disgraceful. 
The two parties have done much bet-
ter than this. As I said, last year, we 
passed five COVID relief bills on a bi-
partisan basis because we all were try-
ing to come together and meet a com-
mon enemy—the COVID–19 virus and 
the consequences of the pandemic. But 
it seems like this $1.9 trillion wish list 
is divorced, really, from the COVID–19 
relief that we did in the past and is de-
signed purely for partisan political pur-
poses, and I think it is an unfortunate 
development in an area where we have 
so successfully worked together in a bi-
partisan way.

NOMINATION OF JENNIFER 
GRANHOLM 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of Governor Jen-
nifer Granholm’s nomination to be Sec-
retary of the Department of Energy. 
I can think of no one better than 
Governor Granholm to lead the Depart-
ment of Energy during this critical and 
transformative period for our country. 
Governor Granholm has the experi-
ence to lead and oversee the 13,500 em-
ployees at the Energy Department. She 
served as the Governor of Michigan 
from 2003 to 2011 and as Michigan’s at-
torney general from 1998 to 2002. 
During her tenure as Governor, she 
led Michigan through the tumultuous 
years of the 2008 financial crisis and 
the resulting bailout of the auto indus-
try. She shepherded over a billion dol-
lars in Federal funding to her State to 
manufacture electric vehicles and bat-
teries. She diversified Michigan’s en-
ergy portfolio and signed into law the 
State’s first renewable energy stand-
ard. 
I won’t hold against the Governor the 
fact that she is a graduate of UC 
Berkeley—I am sure a Stanford Car-
dinal and a Golden Bear can still find 
some common ground and I am sure it 
will help that she will bring the inno-
vative spirit of California along with 
her to her new role as Secretary. 
Following her tenure as Governor, 
Jennifer became a faculty member at 
the UC Berkeley Goldman School of 
Public Policy. She has spent her ca-
reer, both inside and outside of public 
office, as a steadfast advocate for clean 
energy. I have no doubt she will bring 
the same passion if confirmed as Sec-
retary. 
With this appointment, Governor 
Granholm has gained the opportunity 
to understand our unique national lab 
system, which is a critical aspect of 
the Department of Energy. She was a 
project scientist at Lawrence Berkeley 
National Lab, and I look forward to her 
getting to know our 16 other National 
Labs. From basic science to nuclear 
safety, these are gems of the Energy 
Department. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not 
mention the trailblazing nature of the 
Governor’s career. She was Michigan’s 
first female attorney general; Michi-
gan’s first female Governor; and, if 
confirmed, will be only the second 
woman to lead the Energy Department 
since its formation in 1977. She has 
been and will continue to be a role 
model for young women across this 
country. 
The Governor does not have an easy 
task ahead of her, but I have full con-
fidence that she is up to the challenge. 
As chair of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Energy and Water, I look 
forward to working with her closely 
over the coming years to fund clean en-
ergy 
programs, 
confront 
climate 
change, and fulfill the energy and 
water infrastructure needs of Cali-
fornia and our country. 
f 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER 
GRANHOLM 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
now is the time to take substantive ac-
tion to transition to renewable re-
sources, combat climate change, and 
build a brighter future for Americans. 
To help manage that transition, Presi-
dent Biden has nominated Jennifer 
Granholm to be the Secretary of En-
ergy. 
As the first female Governor and first 
female attorney general in Michigan 
history, Granholm oversaw the State’s 
response to the great recession and 
worked closely with the Obama admin-
istration to save the Nation’s auto in-
dustry and 1 million jobs. Granholm 
embraced innovative ideas to electrify 
the auto industry, stimulate State- 
wide job growth, and build the State’s 
clean energy sector. She founded the 
American Jobs Project to promote 
technological advancements and clean 
energy policies to spark job creation 
and continues to push for clean energy 
policy nationwide. 
Additionally, Granholm backed tax 
credits and incentives for wind and 
solar and signed legislation requiring 
Michigan to get 10 percent of its energy 
from renewable sources. She is emi-
nently qualified to spearhead research 
and development and set policies to 
reach President Biden’s stated goal of 
getting to a 100-percent carbon pollu-
tion-free power sector by 2035. 
Granholm received bipartisan sup-
port from the Senate Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee, and we 
should follow their lead. She knows 
that clean energy is the key to cre-
ating millions of good jobs and miti-
gating climate change and is dedicated 
to advancing our Nation’s nuclear se-
curity. For these reasons, I support 
Jennifer Granholm’s nomination for 
Secretary of Energy. 
f 
DARFUR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my concern about 
increasing insecurity in the Darfur re-
gion of Sudan and to call for imme-
diate action to prevent further violence 
and protect civilians. 
As many of my colleagues will recall, 
in 2003 the regime of toppled Sudanese 
dictator Omar al-Bashir began a vi-
cious and deadly campaign against his 
own citizens in the Darfur region. Mil-
lions were driven from their homes, 
and hundreds of thousands killed and 
sometimes raped by militia armed and 
supported by the government. In 2004 
Congress and the State Department 
stood united in determining that what 
was taking place in Darfur was, in fact, 
genocide. Three years after that deter-
mination, the United Nations-African 
Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur, 
UNAMID, was established. 
UNAMID has not been perfect. How-
ever, despite numerous obstacles the 
Government of Sudan put in place 
under al-Bashir to obstruct the mis-
sion’s ability to carry out its mandate 
to protect civilians, UNAMID has pro-
vided critical support for the people of 
Darfur. UNAMID policewomen have 
served as trusted confidants for Darfuri 
women to report sexual and domestic 
violence, and UNAMID soldiers have 
provided a protective presence, deter-
ring violence against civilians in areas 
where they have been deployed. Over-
all, the presence of international forces 
has reinforced some sense of security 
and stability for the hundreds of thou-
sands of people in Darfur who remain 
displaced, so that that they can con-
tinue to live full and dignified lives. 
These efforts have come at significant 
cost both in blood and treasure: 64 
UNAMID 
peacekeepers 
have 
been 
killed, and billions of dollars spent, in 
support of the mission. 
With the fall of Bashir, many had 
hoped that the situation in Darfur 
would improve. However, those hopes 
have yet to be fully realized. Violence 
in West Darfur in late December of 2019 
killed dozens and displaced an esti-
mated 40,000 people. In January 2020, 
two separate violent incidents in North 
Darfur were additional indicators that 
all was not well in the region, as were 
deadly attacks on internally displaced 
camps in July. In January of this year, 
communal clashes in West and South 
Darfur resulted in the death of over 250 
people and the displacement of over 
100,000. These episodes raise the specter 
of a return to the catastrophic and gen-
ocidal violence that engulfed the re-
gion in 2003. But instead of redoubling 
its commitment to Darfur’s long-suf-
fering people at this critical time, the 
international community risks aban-
doning them. 
This past December, the United Na-
tions Security Council made the deci-
sion to dissolve UNAMID. Although it 
will retain a presence in the region 
until it completes its full drawdown at 
the end of June 2021, UNAMID’s core 
civilian protection functions have now 
ceased. UNAMID is to be replaced by 
the United Nations Integrated Transi-
tion Assistance Mission in Sudan, or 
UNITAMS. UNITAMS is a Sudan-wide 
political mission that is aimed at as-
sisting with the transition. I agree that 
such a mission is needed to ensure that 
Sudan’s transition to democracy is suc-
cessful. However, supporting the tran-
sition and protecting vulnerable civil-
ians are not mutually exclusive, and 
the mandate for UNITAMS could have 
included both. Unfortunately, Sudan’s 
transitional government refused to ac-
cept 
this 
course 
of 
action,

UNITAMS therefore lacks UNAMID’s 
Chapter VII authorities to deploy mili-
tary tools in service of civilian protec-
tion and the advancement of peace in 
Darfur. Officials in the transitional 
government at the highest levels have 
argued that a Chapter VII mission is 
not necessary because the security sit-
uation in Darfur has improved; that 
many of the warring parties in Darfur 
have made peace with the Government 
of Sudan through the Juba Peace 
Agreement; that Bashir’s genocidal re-
gime, which bore primary responsi-
bility for the crisis in the region, is no 
longer in power; and that the transi-
tional government is implementing a 
security plan for Darfur that will ade-
quately protect civilians. 
I do not share this assessment of the 
situation in Darfur, and recent clashes, 
as well earlier rounds of violence that 
have plagued Darfur since Sudan’s 
transition began in 2019, demonstrate 
that the region remains fragile. Com-
munal tensions over land, water, and 
political power persist, and Darfur is 
awash in weapons. The government’s 
program to provide security to the re-
gion, including through its National 
Plan for Civilian Protection, has yet to 
be adequately fleshed out let alone im-
plemented. 
Just 
last 
week, 
the 
UNAMID team site at Saraf Umrah 
that was transferred to the Sudanese 
Government on January 21 was looted 
by unnamed assailants, and all of the 
buildings on the site were reportedly 
destroyed despite the government’s 
prior commitment to secure it. The 
Juba Peace Agreement, while prom-
ising, has not been endorsed by all of 
Darfur’s warring parties. And most 
worryingly, those likely to be charged 
with protecting civilians in Darfur, in-
cluding components of the Sudanese 
military and the Rapid Support Forces, 
RSF, of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, are 
the same actors that for years worked 
to implement Bashir’s campaign of ter-
ror and genocide in the region. 
In this context, the United Nations 
Security Council’s ill-timed and poor-
ly-conceived decision to end UNAMID’s 
mandate—facilitated by the Trump ad-
ministration’s lack of a well-thought- 
out diplomatic strategy and approach— 
and to rapidly draw down the mission 
exposes the Darfuri people to signifi-
cant harm. It could derail Sudan’s ci-
vilian-led transition to democracy, re-
sulting in another round of instability 
that Sudan and the broader region can 
ill afford. That is why in February 2020 
I led a group of Senators in writing to 
the Trump administration, urging it to 
ensure that the U.N. maintain a mis-
sion in Darfur with an adequate num-
ber of peacekeeping troops operating 
under a robust Chapter VII mandate to 
protect civilians from violence; and 
that is why I am raising the alarm 
again here today. The United States, 
along with its international partners, 
must work rapidly to put in place 
mechanisms that can protect Darfur’s 
civilians until such a time that Su-
dan’s transitional government is capa-
ble of providing security to the region. 
Fortunately, the plight of Darfur has 
long attracted the bipartisan support 
of Congress and multiple administra-
tions. At this critical time, it is vital 
that our commitment remain stead-
fast. I hope to work with the Biden ad-
ministration to urgently address the 
security vacuum created by UNAMID’s 
drawdown and call upon Secretary of 
State Blinken and United Nations Am-
bassador Thomas-Greenfield to take 
urgent steps. 
First, we must use our voice and vote 
at the UNSC to encourage a temporary 
reauthorization of UNAMID so that it 
can carry out critical protection of ci-
vilian functions, at the very least until 
it fully draws down in June 2021. Sec-
ond, we must work actively at the 
UNSC to strengthen the mandate of 
the UNITAMS so that it includes ro-
bust civilian protection mechanisms. 
Third, we should press Sudan’s civil-
ian-led transitional government to de-
velop a credible civilian protection 
plan in Darfur that does not—I repeat, 
does not—involve the RSF or any other 
forces implicated in violence in Darfur. 
Fourth, 
the 
administration 
should 
carefully monitor progress on civilian 
protection in Darfur and provide sup-
port where necessary, including by con-
sidering how much of the recently ap-
propriated $700 million for Sudan needs 
to be set aside to support civilian secu-
rity in Darfur. Fifth, we must make 
clear to all that sustainable peace in 
Darfur requires justice and account-
ability for past atrocities, no matter 
how powerful the people implicated. 
Mr. President, I strongly support a 
closer 
bilateral 
relationship 
with 
Sudan and will continue, as I have for 
the past 2 years, to do what I can to en-
sure the United States does its part to 
see to it that Sudan’s civilian-led tran-
sition to democracy is successful. We 
have what may be a once in a genera-
tion opportunity. A healthy political 
transition at the national level will 
only aid the cause of peace in Darfur, 
and vice versa. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
situation 
in 
Darfur requires our urgent and consid-
ered attention. Let us continue our 
strong tradition of bipartisan support 
for the long-suffering people of Sudan 
at this critical time. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, once 
again, I have listened to the arguments 
of 
the 
respective 
counsel, 
studied 
briefs, and weighed evidence in an im-
peachment trial of President Donald 
Trump. This is not a responsibility I 
sought or expected. I certainly did not 
anticipate having to serve a second 
time as a Senator-juror in an impeach-
ment trial. 
An initial question shaping the con-
text of this trial was whether or not 
the Senate has constitutional jurisdic-
tion to try a President who is no longer 
in office. The Constitution gives the 
Senate the power to try all impeach-
ments. In this case, where the House 
impeached the President while he was 
in office, it is particularly clear that 
the impeachment is constitutional and 
therefore that this trial is constitu-
tional. The weight of legal opinion and 
historical precedent affirms this con-
clusion. Further, the Senate decided 
this question in the affirmative. I be-
lieve its decision was correct: The Sen-
ate must not surrender its power to 
hold accountable those who abuse their 
office or threaten our Republic, even in 
their final days in office. 
In following the oath in an impeach-
ment trial and in our deliberations on 
the final question, I believe it is up to 
every Senator to determine what to 
consider and what the Constitution and 
their conscience require of them. The 
conclusion I reached on the final ver-
dict will not surprise anyone who read 
my reasoning in the first impeachment 
trial: I consider an attempt to corrupt 
an election to keep oneself in power 
one of the most reprehensible acts that 
can be taken by a sitting President. 
The second impeachment resulted from 
the President’s continued effort to do 
just that. 
His attempt to pressure Georgia’s 
secretary of state to falsify the elec-
toral results was itself a heinous act 
that merited impeachment. President 
Trump summoned his supporters to 
Washington on the very day of the 
electoral vote count, knowing that 
among the people he gathered were 
many who had committed violence in 
the past and who had violent intent. 
Despite the obvious and well-known 
threat of violence, he incited and di-
rected thousands to descend upon the 
seat of Congress as it was undertaking 
the constitutionally prescribed process 
to certify his successor. And then he 
not only failed to defend the Vice 
President and the others at the Capitol 
who he saw were in mortal danger, he 
also incited further violence against 
the Vice President. 
The President’s conduct represented 
an unprecedented violation of his oath 
of office and of the public trust. 
There is a thin line that separates 
our democratic republic from an autoc-
racy: It is a free and fair election and 
the peaceful transfer of power that fol-
lows it. President Trump attempted to 
breach that line, again. What he at-
tempted is what was most feared by 
the Founders. It is the reason they in-
vested Congress with the power to im-
peach. 
Accordingly, I voted to convict Presi-
dent Trump. 
We must also consider how we came 
to a point where a President felt he 
could do as he did without suffering 
meaningful consequence. 
It has become almost clich´ e to say 
that America is divided as never before 
in modern history. So, too, is the ob-
servation that this division is the prod-
uct of a decline in trust in our gov-
erning institutions, of a decline in the 
social bonds forged in churches and 
charities and communities, of expand-
ing income inequality, and of trusted

news sources replaced by cable and 
internet algorithms calculated to in-
flame our prejudices. 
Less unanimous are the predictions 
of where this division will lead. Even 
so, no one suggests that it will lead to 
a better future. Some envision an econ-
omy buffeted by policies drafted by the 
extreme wings of the political parties. 
Others claim that authoritarianism 
will replace democracy. Some antici-
pate social unrest and violence. A few 
even predict civil war. Still others fear 
that a weakened America will become 
vulnerable to an opportunistic foreign 
foe. 
We instinctively know that the grow-
ing division represents a growing dan-
ger. Academics and pundits may pro-
mote cures, but in our hearts, we know 
that their bromides won’t heal the rift. 
People aren’t going to return to main-
stream media, churches aren’t going to 
experience a resurgence, and income 
inequality will remain a persistent fea-
ture of the global digital economy. 
Throughout history, only one thing 
has been able to unite a divided nation: 
great leaders—leaders like Churchill 
who inspired a fearful nation; leaders 
like Lincoln who mustered the na-
tional will to save the Union; and lead-
ers like Reagan who raised our spirits 
from suffocating malaise. Leaders like 
these also have been essential in our 
churches and universities and busi-
nesses and charities, and just as impor-
tantly, in our homes. 
With our Nation so divided, so vul-
nerable to economic distress or to civil 
violence or even to foreign adversaries, 
the need for leadership that unites and 
uplifts, that calls on our better angels, 
is as great as we have ever known. The 
corollary is that the failure of leaders 
to unite, to speak truth, to place duty 
above self, is as dangerous as we have 
ever known. 
With the country as divided as it as-
suredly is, a person in a position of 
leadership who inflames passions with 
the purpose of perpetuating untruth 
commits a singularly dangerous sin 
against the Republic. 
We Senator-jurors did not all vote in 
the same way in this impeachment 
trial. Differences in perception of the 
facts that were presented are to be ex-
pected. So, too, are the differences in 
our respective estimations of the im-
pact of the outcome of the trial. People 
of conscience reached different conclu-
sions. National unity does not require 
unanimity of opinion. 
But civic unity does require truth. 
There is one untruth that divides the 
Nation today like none other: it is that 
the election was stolen, that there was 
a massive conspiracy, more secret and 
widespread than any in human history, 
so brilliant in execution that no evi-
dence can be found of it and no ob-
server among the tens of thousands in 
our intelligence agencies will speak of 
it. 
That lie brought our Nation to a dark 
and dangerous place. Invented and dis-
seminated by the President, it poisoned 
our politics and our public discourse. 
Like you, I hear many calls for 
unity. It is apparent that calling for 
unity while at the same time appeasing 
the big lie of a stolen election is a 
fraud. It is the lie that caused the divi-
sion. It is in the service of that lie that 
a mob invaded the Capitol on January 
6. 
Now that the impeachment trial is 
behind us, it falls to each of us to af-
firm what we all know: President Biden 
won the election through the legiti-
mate vote of the American people. The 
division in America will only begin to 
heal in the light of this truth, a truth 
which must now be affirmed by each of 
us in this Chamber.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. SEAN MCCAGH 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Sean McCagh, a 
Marylander whom we should all emu-
late for his selflessness and passion for 
helping 
others. 
Sean 
touched 
the 
hearts and lives of his family, friends, 
coworkers, patients, and the entire 
community of Allegany County in the 
western part of my State. Sadly, Sean 
was taken far too soon from his family 
and the many neighbors who cared so 
deeply for him due to complications of 
COVID–19. He leaves behind his wife, 
Terri, and three sons, Mike, Cory, and 
Casey. 
Sean was born and raised in Cum-
berland, MD. He graduated from Bishop 
Walsh High School and completed his 
undergraduate studies at Mount St. 
Mary’s University. He earned his med-
ical degree from Georgetown Univer-
sity School of Medicine and completed 
his dermatology residency at the Uni-
versity of West Virginia. He returned 
to the hometown he loved so well and 
joined his brother Mike’s dermatology 
practice in 1996. 
Sean was a man of vision who was 
never one to sit idly by. He volunteered 
his time as the athletic physician for 
Allegany High School for several years 
and later established a community 
fundraiser known as the Hooley Plunge 
to support the ice rink at the local 
YMCA. When the YMCA closed the ice 
rink, Sean redirected his efforts to an-
other cause close to his heart, people 
with developmental disabilities. With 
Sean as its champion for 17 years, the 
Hooley Plunge has raised more than 
$1.5 million to support the Special 
Olympics of Allegany County and other 
local programs that serve individuals 
with development disabilities. It has 
become the largest single-day fund-
raising event in Allegany County, with 
hundreds of brave souls running into 
the freezing waters of Rocky Gap State 
Park’s Lake Habeeb in return for dona-
tions. 
A few years ago, Sean received the 
Community Service Award from the 
Allegany County Chamber of Com-
merce, one of numerous entities to rec-
ognize his unwavering commitment to 
the greater good. Sean’s sister, Erin 
McCagh Morrissey, has fittingly called 
him Cumberland’s George Bailey, refer-
ring to the community-minded banker 
James Stewart played in the classic 
movie, ‘‘It’s a Wonderful Life.’’ 
While Sean loved his job as a der-
matologist and was passionate about 
helping others, he also loved being a 
cattle farmer. When his middle son, 
Cory, graduated from college, Sean en-
couraged him to follow his dream to 
start a brewery. With Cory’s vision and 
Sean’s support and investment, they 
christened the 200-year-old barn on the 
family’s farm as the ‘‘1812 Brewery,’’ 
which set the stage for a growing and 
mutually supportive family of small 
brewers to attract tourists and en-
hance the lives of local residents. 
While the people of Allegany County 
grieve the sudden, stunning loss of a 
cherished husband, father, friend, doc-
tor, businessman, and community lead-
er, I ask my Senate colleagues to join 
me in remembering and honoring the 
life of Dr. Sean McCagh who, through 
his service and love for people, has left 
his community a better place.∑

TRIBUTE TO BIRGIT KLOHS 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a lifelong leader of West 
Michigan’s 
economic 
development 
community, Birgit Klohs, president 
and CEO of The Right Place in Grand 
Rapids, MI. Ms. Klohs has made an im-
mense impact on western Michigan 
over the past 33 years and has helped 
reshape the region and State’s future. 
Born in West Germany, Ms. Klohs 
left her home country to attend West-
ern Michigan University in Kalamazoo, 
where she graduated with a bachelors 
of business administration in finance. 
While going to school full time, she 
began her economic development ca-
reer in service to the Berrien County 
Economic Development Corporation as 
an industrial consultant and then even-
tually moved to the Michigan Depart-
ment of Commerce where she served as 
an account executive focusing on west-
ern Michigan. 
Later, as assistant director of the Of-
fice for Economic Expansion at Grand 
Valley State University, Ms. Klohs was 
asked to join the region’s first-ever Eu-
ropean foreign investment mission in 
conjunction with The Right Place. The 
Right Place, an organization started in 
1985 by Grand Rapids area business ex-
ecutives, was concerned that the region 
was missing out on economic opportu-
nities. That trip involved discussions 
with a German company that 2 years 
later broke ground on a new manufac-
turing plant just north of Grand Rap-
ids, a highlight in Klohs’ career dedi-
cated to keeping and growing jobs in 
the region. 
Mrs. Klohs applied for the director-
ship of The Right Place and began lead-
ing the organization as president and 
CEO in 1987. At that time, The Right 
Place had a small staff serving one 
county; after Ms. Klohs’ dynamic lead-
ership and expertise, it grew into a

team of more than 30 professionals 
serving a six-county region. Through-
out her three decades of leadership, 
The Right Place has assisted thousands 
of west Michigan companies to invest 
more than $5 billion and create 48,500 
new jobs throughout the region. 
Ms. Klohs also helped the region, 
known for its manufacturing heritage, 
to grow its skill and sophistication in 
making things, from medical devices to 
office furniture. In the process, she 
helped the region grow and increase 
the job opportunities across many sec-
tors. Those efforts attracted attention 
worldwide, with ‘‘The Economist’’ last 
year citing Grand Rapids as ‘‘the most 
successful 
intensive 
manufacturing 
city in America’’ and Forbes ranking 
Grand Rapids No. 2 on its list of the top 
15 industrial cities in America. 
Over her career, Ms. Klohs worked 
closely with five Michigan Governors 
to pursue economic development op-
portunities around the globe. The re-
gion is now home to 136 foreign compa-
nies, including more than 50 from her 
homeland of Germany. She is credited 
with fostering countless public-private 
ventures that advance the economic 
prosperity of the region, including the 
Medical Mile which is the 10th largest 
life science cluster in the United 
States, the Michigan Manufacturing 
Technology Center West, and partner-
ships with Hello West Michigan, the 
first employer-driven relocation and 
job information center in the Nation. 
Most recently, The Right Place rec-
ognized that economic prosperity was 
not being shared by all citizens. That 
led to the creation of a New Commu-
nity Transformation Fund to uplift 
communities of color through capital 
investment. As the pandemic reared its 
ugly head throughout 2020, The Right 
Place quickly pivoted to assist in de-
livering $10 million in emergency fi-
nancial aid to 1200 struggling busi-
nesses in the Grand Rapids community 
and harnessed the region’s manufac-
turing ingenuity and supply chains to 
create and distribute lifesaving per-
sonal protective equipment. 
Ms. Klohs’ commitment to the region 
and State was not limited to The Right 
Place. Among the boards she chaired or 
served on are the Michigan Economic 
Development Corporation, the Gerald 
R. Ford Airport Authority, the Inter-
national Crossing Authority, and the 
Western Michigan University Board of 
Trustees, her alma mater. 
Ms. Birgit Klohs was fond of saying 
that economic development was ‘‘a 
team sport.’’ After 33 years as captain 
of one of the Nation’s most successful 
teams, I ask all of my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating her for her 
well-earned retirement from The Right 
Place and to wish Birgit and her family 
health and happiness in the years 
ahead.∑

REMEMBERING SHERRIFF 
STEPHEN BATES 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Stephen Bates, 
who was Vermont’s first Black sheriff 
and chief of police. Mr. Bates was 
elected sheriff and chief of police of 
Vergennes, VT, in 1879, where he served 
as a public official until his death in 
1907. 
Mr. Bates faced many obstacles on 
his journey to his elected positions in 
Vergennes. Born in Shirley, VA, in 
1842, historical records show that he 
and his family members were enslaved 
on the Shirley plantation. In August of 
1862, Mr. Bates successfully escape 
from the Shirley plantation. Several 
months prior to the Emancipation Act 
of 1863, Mr. Bates courageously helped 
many other enslaved people escape to 
freedom. 
After the Civil War, when Mr. Bates 
was in the service of officers at Har-
rison’s Landing, Mr. Bates was em-
ployed by U.S. Representative Fred-
erick E. Woodbridge, of Vergennes, VT. 
Mr. Bates worked as Congressman 
Woodbridge’s coachman and moved 
with him to Vergennes in 1866. In 1871, 
Mr. Bates married Frances Mason of 
Elizabethtown, NY, and had two chil-
dren, Rose and Fredrick. The Bates 
family 
lived 
on 
North 
Street 
in 
Vergennes until 1880, when their home 
was destroyed by a fire. The residents 
of Vergennes showed much support to 
the family following the fire, rallying 
to raise money to help them during 
that difficult time. 
During his time as chief of police, 
Mr. Bates was responsible for some no-
table 
arrests, 
including 
‘‘Brooklyn 
Slim’’ and ‘‘Ottawa Red,’’ two members 
of a gang of post office burglars. He 
also had in his custody Oliver Curtis 
Perry, an infamous New York train 
robber of the time. Newspaper articles 
describe Mr. Bates as the arresting offi-
cer in murder, grand larceny, check 
forgery, 
and 
vagrancy 
cases 
in 
Vergennes and the surrounding area. In 
1897, Mr. Bates was awarded $100 by the 
Assistant Attorney General of the Post 
Office Department for his extraor-
dinary work in arresting two people in-
volved with robbing post offices in 
Morrisville, Glover, and Windsor, VT, 
in 1894. 
Though Mr. Bates dedicated his life 
to his community, he still faced many 
challenges as the first Black sheriff in 
Vermont. During one incident, a man 
tried to kill Sheriff Bates while he was 
responding to a call. And while the 
man was charged with attempted mur-
der, he was found guilty of obstructing, 
beating, 
and 
wounding 
an 
officer. 
Vergennes community members stated 
that Mr. Bates ‘‘was almost entirely a 
self-taught man, and in the discharge 
of the duties of his office was cool and 
self-restrained, rarely if ever acting 
hastily.’’ Despite this, Mr. Bates was 
not well-compensated for his work and 
was required to work a number of other 
jobs to provide for his family. As he 
was skilled at handling and caring for 
horses, he managed a horse company 
owned by Congressman Woodbridge’s 
son. He also worked as a trusted night 
watchman at a local bank, as well as a 
custodian. Uniquely dedicated to his 
community despite the hardship he 
faced, Mr. Bates also served as an ap-
pointed agent for the Humane Society, 
and he and his family were active 
members 
of 
St. 
Paul’s 
Episcopal 
Church in Vergennes. Mr. Bates died 
from cardiac arrest while milking a 
cow on June 10, 1907. 
I am proud to honor the life and work 
of Mr. Stephen Bates. Though he re-
mains relatively unknown by many 
Vermonters, it is encouraging to know 
that Vergennes and its residents came 
together not long after the end of the 
Civil War to elect Vermont’s first 
Black sheriff and chief of police, who 
was an exemplary public servant and 
community leader. It is a remarkable 
American story that I am glad to 
honor and celebrate.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO THE CLEMMONS 
FAMILY 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of Dr. Jack and 
Lydia Clemmons of Charlotte, VT. The 
Clemmons family’s positive impact on 
Vermont is powerful every single day, 
but I am especially pleased to recog-
nize them during Black History Month. 
The Clemmons family has been instru-
mental in preserving and promoting 
African-American farm heritage in my 
home State of Vermont, and for that, I 
am extremely grateful. 
In 1962, Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons 
moved 
to 
Vermont, 
where 
Dr. 
Clemmons joined the University of 
Vermont’s department of pathology 
and became the second African-Amer-
ican on the faculty of the College of 
Medicine. Dr. Clemmons is nationally 
recognized 
for 
his 
ground-breaking 
work in perinatal pathology and cyto-
genetics. He has long advocated for 
universities to implement recruitment 
strategies that attract and retain more 
students and faculty of color. Mrs. 
Clemmons was the first African-Amer-
ican nurse anesthetist at the Univer-
sity of Vermont Medical Center. 
During the same year that they 
began their careers in Burlington, VT, 
Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons purchased a 
historic farm in Charlotte, which was 
in need of significant repair and im-
provement. They raised five children 
on their farm, while working hard to 
restore its many buildings and working 
lands. For the Clemmons family, as 1 of 
only 17 Black-owned farms in Vermont, 
the work was always about more than 
one farm; it was about the massive loss 
of Black-owned farmland in Vermont 
and across the Nation. 
To that end, Dr. and Mrs. Clemmons 
have worked tirelessly to ensure their 
farm can continue under African-Amer-
ican 
ownership 
for 
generations 
to 
come. They, along with their family, 
have also dedicated themselves to 
fighting for racial justice and creating 
opportunities for Vermonters to learn 
about Black arts, farming, heritage, 
and culture. The arts are a particular 
passion of Mrs. Clemmons, who ran a

the Clemmons farm is now 1 of 22 offi-
cial landmarks on Vermont’s African- 
American Heritage Trail, also serving 
as a multicultural arts center, with a 
gallery 
and 
programming 
for 
all 
Vermonters to enjoy. 
I am grateful to Dr. and Mrs.

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-

from the President of the United

report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Cuba 
that was declared on March 1, 1996, in 
Proclamation 6867, as amended by 
Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, 
Proclamation 9398 on February 24, 2016, 
and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 
2018, is to continue in effect beyond 
March 1, 2021. 
There remains a need to continue 
this national emergency, based on a 
disturbance or threatened disturbance 
of the international relations for the 
United States related to Cuba. The un-
authorized entry of any United States- 
registered vessel into Cuban territorial 
waters continues to be detrimental to 
the foreign policy of the United States. 
The unauthorized entry of vessels 
subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States into Cuban territorial 
waters is currently a violation of Fed-
eral law. Further, the unauthorized 
entry of United States-registered ves-
sels into Cuban territorial waters con-
tinues to be detrimental to United 
States foreign policy and counter to 
the purpose of Executive Order 12807, 
which is to ensure, among other things, 
safe, orderly, and legal migration. The 
possibility of large-scale unauthorized 
entries of United States-registered ves-
sels 
into 
Cuban 
territorial 
waters 
would disturb the international rela-
tions of the United States regarding 
Cuba by allowing for or providing the 
means to facilitate a mass migration of 
Cuban nationals and threatening our 
national security. 
Therefore, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency with respect to Cuba and 
the emergency authority relating to 
the regulation of the anchorage and 
movement of vessels set out in Procla-
mation 6867, as amended by Proclama-
tion 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proc-
lamation 9699.

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN PROCLAMATION 9994 
OF MARCH 13, 2020, WITH RE-
SPECT

CORONAVIRUS

(COVID–19) 
PAN-
DEMIC—PM 3 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Procla-
mation 9994 of March 13, 2020, begin-
ning March 1, 2020, concerning the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) 
pandemic, is to continue in effect be-
yond March 1, 2021. 
There remains a need to continue 
this national emergency. The COVID– 
19 pandemic continues to cause signifi-
cant risk to the public health and safe-
ty of the Nation. More than 500,000 peo-
ple in this Nation have perished from 
the disease, and it is essential to con-
tinue 
to 
combat 
and 
respond 
to 
COVID–19 with the full capacity and 
capability of the Federal Government. 
Therefore, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Proclamation 
9994 concerning the COVID–19 pan-
demic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S859 
February 24, 2021 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. 
BROWN, 
Ms. 
STABENOW, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Ms. SMITH, Mr. VAN
HOLLEN, 
and Mr. SANDERS): 
S. 411. A bill to improve Federal ef-
forts with respect to the prevention of 
maternal mortality, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 411 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mothers and 
Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Aware-
ness Act’’ or the ‘‘MOMMA’s Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Every year, across the United States, 
nearly 4,000,000 women give birth, about 700 
women suffer fatal complications during 
pregnancy, while giving birth or during the 
postpartum period, and about 70,000 women 
suffer near-fatal, partum-related complica-
tions. 
(2) The maternal mortality rate is often 
used as a proxy to measure the overall 
health of a population. While the infant mor-
tality rate in the United States has reached 
its lowest point, the risk of death for women 
in the United States during pregnancy, 
childbirth, or the postpartum period is high-
er than such risk in many other high-income 
countries. The estimated maternal mortality 
rate (deaths per 100,000 live births) for the 48 
contiguous States and Washington, D.C. in-
creased from 14.5 percent in 2000 to 17.3 in 
2017. The United States is the only industri-
alized nation with a rising maternal mor-
tality rate. 
(3) The National Vital Statistics System of 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion has found that in 2018, there were 17.4 
maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births 
in the United States. This ratio is more than 
double that of most other high-income coun-
tries. 
(4) It is estimated that more than 60 per-
cent of maternal deaths in the United States 
are preventable. 
(5) According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the maternal mor-
tality rate varies drastically for women by 
race and ethnicity. There are about 13 deaths 
per 100,000 live births for White women, 40.8 
deaths per 100,000 live births for non-His-
panic Black women, and 29.7 deaths per 
100,000 live births for American Indian/Alas-
kan Native women. While maternal mor-
tality disparately impacts Black women, 
this urgent public health crisis traverses 
race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, edu-
cational background, and geography. 
(6) In the United States, non-Hispanic 
Black women are about 3 times more likely 
to die from causes related to pregnancy and 
childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White 
women, which is one of the most dis-
concerting 
racial 
disparities 
in 
public 
health. This disparity widens in certain cit-
ies and States across the country. 
(7) According to the National Center for 
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the maternal mor-
tality rate heightens with age, as women 40 
and older die at a rate of 81.9 per 100,000 
births compared to 10.6 per 100,000 for women 
under 25. This translates to women over 40 
being 7.7 times more likely to die compared 
to their counterparts under 25 years of age. 
(8) The COVID–19 pandemic risks exacer-
bating the maternal health crisis. A recent 
study of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention suggests that pregnant women 
are at a significantly higher risk for severe 
outcomes, including death, from COVID–19 
as compared to non-pregnant women. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has also decreased ac-
cess to prenatal and postpartum care. 
(9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) 
through (8) are of major concern to research-
ers, academics, members of the business 
community, and providers across the obstet-
ric continuum represented by organizations 
such as— 
(A) the American College of Nurse-Mid-
wives; 
(B) the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists; 
(C) the American Medical Association; 
(D) the Association of Women’s Health, Ob-
stetric and Neonatal Nurses; 
(E) the Black Mamas Matter Alliance; 
(F) the Black Women’s Health Imperative; 
(G) the California Maternal Quality Care 
Collaborative; 
(H) EverThrive Illinois; 
(I) the Illinois Perinatal Quality Collabo-
rative; 
(J) the March of Dimes; 
(K) the National Association of Certified 
Professional Midwives; 
(L) the National Birth Equity Collabo-
rative; 
(M) the National Partnership for Women & 
Families; 
(N) the National Polycystic Ovary Syn-
drome Association; 
(O) the Preeclampsia Foundation; 
(P) the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medi-
cine; and 
(Q) the What To Expect Project. 
(10) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coro-
nary conditions, cardiomyopathy, infection 
or sepsis, embolism, mental health condi-
tions (including substance use disorder), hy-
pertensive disorders, stroke and cerebro-
vascular accidents, and anesthesia complica-
tions are the predominant medical causes of 
maternal-related deaths and complications. 
Most of these conditions are largely prevent-
able or manageable. Even when these condi-
tions are not preventable, mortality and 
morbidity may be prevented when conditions 
are diagnosed and treated in a timely man-
ner. 
(11) According to a study published by the 
Journal of Perinatal Education, doula-as-
sisted mothers are 4 times less likely to have 
a low-birthweight baby, 2 times less likely to 
experience a birth complication involving 
themselves or their baby, and significantly 
more likely to initiate breastfeeding. Doula 
care has also been shown to produce cost 
savings resulting in part from reduced rates 
of cesarean and pre-term births. 
(12) Intimate partner violence is one of the 
leading causes of maternal death, and women 
are more likely to experience intimate part-
ner violence during pregnancy than at any 
other time in their lives. It is also more dan-
gerous than pregnancy. Intimate partner vi-
olence during pregnancy and postpartum 
crosses every demographic and has been ex-
acerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(13) Oral health is an important part of 
perinatal health. Reducing bacteria in a 
woman’s mouth during pregnancy can sig-
nificantly reduce her risk of developing oral 
diseases and spreading decay-causing bac-
teria to her baby. Moreover, some evidence 
suggests that women with periodontal dis-
ease during pregnancy could be at greater 
risk for poor birth outcomes, such as 
preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low-birth 
weight. Furthermore, a woman’s oral health 
during pregnancy is a good predictor of her 
newborn’s oral health, and since mothers can 
unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their 
babies, putting their children at higher risk 
for tooth decay, prevention efforts should 
happen even before children are born, as a 
matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal 
care during pregnancy. 
(14) In the United States, death reporting 
and analysis is a State function rather than 
a Federal process. States report all deaths— 
including maternal deaths—on a semi-vol-
untary basis, without standardization across 
States. While the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has the capacity and system 
for collecting death-related data based on 
death certificates, these data are not suffi-
ciently reported by States in an organized 
and standard format across States such that 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion is able to identify causes of maternal 
death and best practices for the prevention 
of such death. 
(15) Vital statistics systems often under-
estimate maternal mortality and are insuffi-
cient data sources from which to derive a 
full scope of medical and social determinant 
factors contributing to maternal deaths, 
such as intimate partner violence. While the 
addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death 
certificates since 2003 have likely improved 
States’ abilities to identify pregnancy-re-
lated deaths, they are not generally com-
pleted by obstetric providers or persons 
trained to recognize pregnancy-related mor-
tality. Thus, these vital forms may be miss-
ing information or may capture inconsistent 
data. Due to varying maternal mortality-re-
lated analyses, lack of reliability, and granu-
larity in data, current maternal mortality 
informatics do not fully encapsulate the 
myriad medical and socially determinant 
factors that contribute to such high mater-
nal mortality rates within the United States 
compared to other developed nations. Lack 
of standardization of data and data sharing 
across States and between Federal entities, 
health networks, and research institutions 
keep the Nation in the dark about ways to 
prevent maternal deaths. 
(16) Having reliable and valid State data 
aggregated at the Federal level are critical 
to the Nation’s ability to quell surges in ma-
ternal death and imperative for researchers 
to identify long-lasting interventions. 
(17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly 
recommend that maternal deaths and cases 
of maternal morbidity, including complica-
tions that result in chronic illness and fu-
ture increased risk of death, be investigated 
at the State level first, and that standard-
ized, streamlined, de-identified data regard-
ing maternal deaths be sent annually to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Such data standardization and collection 
would be similar in operation and effect to 
the National Program of Cancer Registries of 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and akin to the Confidential Enquiry in 
Maternal Deaths Programme in the United 
Kingdom. Such a maternal mortalities and 
morbidities registry and surveillance system 
would help providers, academicians, law-
makers, and the public to address questions 
concerning the types of, causes of, and best 
practices to thwart, maternal mortality and 
morbidity. 
(18) The United Nations’ Millennium De-
velopment Goal 5a aimed to reduce by 75 per-
cent, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal 
mortality rate, yet this metric has not been 
achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality 
rate in the United States has been estimated 
to have more than doubled between 2000 and 
2014. 
(19) Many States have struggled to estab-
lish or maintain Maternal Mortality Review

February 24, 2021 
Committees (referred to in this section as 
‘‘MMRC’’). On the State level, MMRCs have 
lagged because States have not had the re-
sources to mount local reviews. State-level 
reviews are necessary as only the State de-
partments of health have the authority to 
request medical records, autopsy reports, 
and police reports critical to the function of 
the MMRC. 
(20) The United States has no comparable, 
coordinated Federal process by which to re-
view cases of maternal mortality, systems 
failures, or best practices. Many States have 
active MMRCs and leverage their work to 
impact maternal wellness. For example, the 
State of California has worked extensively 
with their State health departments, health 
and hospital systems, and research collabo-
rative organizations, including the Cali-
fornia Maternal Quality Care Collaborative 
and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal 
Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein such 
State has determined the most prevalent 
causes of maternal mortality and recorded 
and shared data with providers and research-
ers, who have developed and implemented 
safety bundles and care protocols related to 
preeclampsia, 
maternal 
hemorrhage, 
peripartum cardiomyopathy, and the like. In 
this way, the State of California has been 
able to leverage its maternal mortality re-
view board system, generate data, and apply 
those data to effect changes in maternal 
care-related protocol. To date, the State of 
California has reduced its maternal mor-
tality rate, which is now comparable to the 
low rates of the United Kingdom. 
(21) Hospitals and health systems across 
the United States lack standardization of 
emergency obstetric protocols before, dur-
ing, and after delivery. Consequently, many 
providers are delayed in recognizing critical 
signs 
indicating 
maternal 
distress 
that 
quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal 
incidences. Moreover, any attempt to ad-
dress an obstetric emergency that does not 
consider both clinical and public health ap-
proaches falls woefully under the mark of ex-
cellent care delivery. State-based perinatal 
quality collaboratives, or entities partici-
pating in the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
ternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetric 
protocols, tool kits, and other resources to 
improve system care and response as they re-
late to maternal complications and warning 
signs for such conditions as maternal hemor-
rhage, 
hypertension, 
and 
preeclampsia. 
These perinatal quality collaboratives serve 
an important role in providing infrastruc-
ture that supports quality improvement ef-
forts addressing obstetric care and outcomes. 
State-based perinatal quality collaboratives 
partner with hospitals, physicians, nurses, 
patients, public health, and other stake-
holders to provide opportunities for collabo-
rative learning, rapid response data, and 
quality improvement science support to 
achieve systems-level change. 
(22) The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reports that nearly half of all 
maternal deaths occur in the immediate 
postpartum period—the 42 days following a 
pregnancy—whereas more than one-third of 
maternal deaths occur while a person is still 
pregnant. Further, 21 percent of maternal 
deaths 
occur 
between 
1 
and 
6 
weeks 
postpartum, and 12 percent of maternal 
deaths occur during the remaining portion of 
the postpartum year. Yet, for women eligible 
for the Medicaid program on the basis of 
pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at 
the end of the month on which the 60th 
postpartum day lands. 
(23) The experience of serious traumatic 
events, such as being exposed to domestic vi-
olence, substance use disorder, or pervasive 
and systematic racism, can over-activate the 
body’s stress-response system. Known as 
toxic stress, the repetition of high-doses of 
cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy neu-
rological development and other body sys-
tems, which can have cascading physical and 
mental health consequences, as documented 
in the Adverse Childhood Experiences study 
of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention. 
(24) A growing body of evidence-based re-
search has shown the correlation between 
the stress associated with systematic racism 
and one’s birthing outcomes. The undue 
stress of sex and race discrimination paired 
with institutional racism has been dem-
onstrated to contribute to a higher risk of 
maternal mortality, irrespective of one’s 
gestational 
age, 
maternal 
age, 
socio-
economic status, educational level, or indi-
vidual-level health risk factors, including 
poverty, limited access to prenatal care, and 
poor physical and mental health (although 
these are not nominal factors). Black women 
remain the most at risk for pregnancy-asso-
ciated or pregnancy-related causes of death. 
When it comes to preeclampsia, for example, 
for which obesity is a risk factor, Black 
women of normal weight remain at a higher 
at risk of dying during the perinatal period 
compared to non-Black obese women. 
(25) The rising maternal mortality rate in 
the United States is driven predominantly 
by the disproportionately high rates of Black 
maternal mortality. 
(26) Compared to women from other racial 
and ethnic demographics, Black women 
across the socioeconomic spectrum experi-
ence prolonged, unrelenting stress related to 
systematic racial and gender discrimination, 
contributing to higher rates of maternal 
mortality, giving birth to low-weight babies, 
and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a 
risk-factor for these aforementioned experi-
ences. This cumulative stress, called weath-
ering, often extends across the life course 
and is situated in everyday spaces where 
Black women establish livelihood. System-
atic racism, structural barriers, lack of ac-
cess to care, lack of access to nutritious 
food, and social determinants of health exac-
erbate Black women’s likelihood to experi-
ence poor or fatal birthing outcomes, but do 
not fully account for the great disparity. 
(27) Black women are twice as likely to ex-
perience postpartum depression, and dis-
proportionately higher rates of preeclampsia 
compared to White women. 
(28) Racism is deeply ingrained in United 
States systems, including in health care de-
livery systems between patients and pro-
viders, often resulting in disparate treat-
ment for pain, irreverence for cultural norms 
with respect to health, and dismissiveness. 
However, the provider pool is not primed 
with many people of color, nor are providers 
(whether maternity care clinicians or mater-
nity care support personnel) consistently re-
quired to undergo implicit bias, cultural 
competency, respectful care practices, or 
empathy training on a consistent, on-going 
basis. 
(29) Not all people who have been pregnant 
or given birth identify as being a ‘‘woman’’. 
The terms ‘‘birthing people’’ or ‘‘birthing 
persons’’ are also used to describe pregnant 
and postpartum people.

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. ROSEN): 
S. 436. A bill to provide Federal 
matching 
funding 
for 
State-level 
broadband programs; to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
introduce 
the 
American 
Broadband Buildout Act. This legisla-
tion would help ensure that rural 
Americans have access to broadband 
services at the speeds they need to par-
ticipate fully in the benefits of our 
modern society and economy. I want to 
thank my colleague Senator ROSEN for 
joining me in introducing this bill 
today. 
Twenty-five years ago, Americans 
typically accessed the internet using 
their home phone lines via modems, ca-
pable of downloading data at just 56 
kilobits per second, too slow even to 
support MP3-quality streaming music. 
Today, the Federal Communications 
Commission defines broadband service 
as having a threshold download speed 
nearly 500 times faster. 
Many areas of our country, particu-
larly our rural communities, simply do 
not have the infrastructure to achieve 
these speeds and fully tap into the op-
portunities that digital connectivity 
can deliver. According to a 2019 Pew 
Research Center survey, nearly 37 per-
cent 
of 
rural 
Americans 
lack 
a 
broadband connection compared to 25 
percent of urban Americans. 
Similar disparities occur in terms of 
broadband adoption. That is the rate at 
which 
Americans 
subscribe 
to 
broadband service once they have ac-
cess to it. 
The survey also found that 15 percent 
of rural Americans don’t use the inter-
net at home compared to just 9 percent 
of urban Americans. 
The current pandemic has brought 
these 
connectivity 
challenges 
into 
stark focus as many families have had 
to move their education, their work-
places, and their healthcare services 
online. 
Andrea Powers, the town manager of 
Fort Fairfield in northern Maine, re-
cently described a number of chal-
lenges in her community: students who 
have to sit on the town’s library steps 
in order to finish research projects and 
submit their papers; a business owner 
who was forced to relocate his com-
pany to another community in order to 
have a chance to succeed; a senior cit-
izen who requires the care of distant 
doctors but does not have the capacity 
to travel nor access the telehealth op-
tions. 
Andrea told me the story of one fam-
ily whose jobs rely heavily on access to 
high-speed broadband. They were told 
that it would cost them $15,000 to bring 
that connection to their doorstep. An-
drea summed up the reality facing so 
many rural communities that lack ac-
cess in this way. She said: ‘‘We will 
continue to see a loss of business reten-
tion and expansion along with job cre-
ation. We simply cannot afford to allow 
this to happen. Online schooling, busi-
ness growth and development, tele-
health care, and economic agriculture 
success are all dependent on . . . af-
fordable fiber optic broadband.’’ 
Telehealth services are an essential 
piece of the national broadband con-
versation. Often, rural communities 
struggle 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
healthcare providers that they need to 
ensure 
access 
to 
quality 
care. 
Broadband is vital to bridging that gap 
to enable innovative healthcare deliv-
ery. 
Let me give you an example. Hospice 
workers at Northern Light Homecare 
were able to use the internet and video 
technology to help support a patient 
living on an island off the coast of 
Maine—not far as the seagull flies, but 
hours away in travel time. Although 
the connection was poor, the video en-
abled nurses to monitor the patient’s 
condition and symptoms and, equally 
important, to provide emotional sup-
port to her and to her family. As one 
hospice worker put it, ‘‘our hospice 
team could be doing so much more 
with video and telemonitoring tech-
nologies if only Maine had better 
connectivity.’’ 
The American Broadband Buildout 
Act would help close this ‘‘digital di-
vide’’ between urban and rural America 
by providing up to $15 billion in match-
ing grants to assist States and State-

February 24, 2021 
approved entities in building that 
‘‘last-mile’’ 
infrastructure 
to 
bring 
high-speed 
broadband 
directly 
to 
homes and businesses in areas that 
lack it. 
Projects would have to be located in 
unserved areas—that is, areas where 
broadband is unavailable at speeds that 
meet the FCC standards. Focusing on 
those areas will direct support where it 
is most needed and will protect against 
overbuilding where infrastructure is al-
ready in place. 
The Federal funding authorized in 
our bill would be matched through pub-
lic-private partnerships between the 
broadband service provider and the 
State where they provide service. This 
means that States and their private 
sector partners will have ‘‘skin in the 
game’’ so that the projects will be well 
thought out and sustainable. This 
model will also incentivize existing 
service providers to extend their net-
works to rural areas and swiftly con-
nect new households. 
Third, the bill would require that 
projects be designed to be ‘‘future 
proof,’’ meaning that the infrastruc-
ture installed must be capable of deliv-
ering higher speeds as broadband accel-
erates in the future. We want these in-
vestments to serve rural Americans 
now and in the future without having 
to rebuild every time technology ad-
vances. 
Our bill would also prioritize projects 
in 
States 
that 
have 
traditionally 
lagged behind the national average in 
terms of broadband subscribers and 
those that are at risk of falling further 
behind as broadband speeds increase. 
Finally, the bill would provide grants 
for digital literacy and public aware-
ness campaigns to encourage wider 
broadband adoption once access is 
available. Increasing broadband adop-
tion will help drive down the cost of 
the service and make it more afford-
able for everyone. 
Rural Americans need access to high- 
speed internet just as urban Americans 
do. In fact, one could argue they need 
it even more, especially during these 
times that can require remote work, 
education, and healthcare. The bill 
that Senator ROSEN and I are intro-
ducing today would help bridge this 
digital 
divide 
by 
funding 
‘‘future 
proof’’ broadband where it is needed 
most and give a boost to job creation 
in rural America. 
As the Presiding Officer well knows, 
businesses will not locate in areas that 
do not have this essential service, in 
many cases. I urge all of our colleagues 
to join in supporting this bill. 
Thank you.

FORCEMENT 
Ms. ERNST (for herself, Mr. GRASS-
LEY, and Mrs. FISCHER) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 71 
Whereas Sarah Root of Council Bluffs, 
Iowa, died at the hands of a drunk driver who 
was not lawfully present in the United 
States; 
Whereas the mission of the immigration 
enforcement process is to ensure the safety 
of our communities; and 
Whereas drunk driving and aliens con-
victed of drunk driving are a threat to public 
safety of the United States, and to say other-
wise is offensive to both the victims of drunk 
driving offenses and those who seek to en-
force criminal statutes related to drunk 
driving: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that any guidance issued by the Department 
of Homeland Security or U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement as it relates to 
immigration enforcement and removal of 
aliens should not deprioritize the removal of 
aliens convicted of— 
(1) drunk driving or otherwise driving 
under the influence; or 
(2) any crime which includes as an element 
an act of assault or violence.

Mr. INHOFE, Mr. HOEVEN, Mr. HAGERTY, 
Mr. LANKFORD, and Mr. CRAPO) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: 
S. RES. 72 
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action 
(commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
‘‘JCPOA’’), an agreement that was finalized 
by the administration of President Barack 
Obama and the governments of the United 
Kingdom, Germany, France, the People’s Re-
public of China, and the Russian Federation 
in July 2015, provided Iran permanent sanc-
tions 
relief 
and 
access 
to 
more 
than 
$100,000,000,000 in return for temporary re-
strictive measures on Iran’s nuclear pro-
gram; 
Whereas, under the JCPOA, restrictions on 
the number and types of centrifuges that 
Iran may manufacture, retain, test, and use, 
the number and types of enrichment facili-
ties that Iran may construct, and the 
amount and level of enriched uranium and 
heavy water that Iran may stockpile, will 
expire; 
Whereas multiple United Nations Security 
Council resolutions adopted between 2006 and 
2010 required Iran to suspend all enrichment 
of uranium, but the JCPOA did not require 
Iran to cease its enrichment of uranium, a 
failure that is directly responsible for Iran’s 
expanded enrichment activity today; 
Whereas United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 2231 (in this preamble referred to 
as ‘‘UNSCR 2231’’), adopted on July 20, 2015, 
called on Iran not to undertake any activity 
related to nuclear-capable ballistic missile 
activities for 8 years and imposed a 5-year 
ban on conventional arms transfers to and 
from Iran; 
Whereas neither the JCPOA nor UNSCR 
2231 adequately addressed the threat ema-
nating from Iran’s ballistic and cruise mis-
sile program or long-standing support for 
terrorism, and the sunset provisions applied 
to prohibitions in UNSCR 2231 and the 
JCPOA severely weakened their restrictions 
and inadvertently legitimized that program 
and support; 
Whereas, based on the shortcomings of the 
JCPOA and UNSCR 2231, bipartisan majori-
ties in both the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives opposed the JCPOA and the 
sanctions relief for Iran contained in the 
agreement; 
Whereas the sanctions relief contained in 
the JCPOA provided resources necessary for 
Iran to continue developing ballistic missiles 
and supporting terrorism; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (in this preamble referred to as 
the ‘‘IRGC’’) as a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion under section 219(a) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)) and a 
specially designated global terrorist entity 
pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 
1701 note; relating to blocking property and 
prohibiting transactions with persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support ter-
rorism); 
Whereas, by a vote of 98–2 in the Senate 
and 419–3 in the House of Representatives, 
Congress required the imposition of ter-
rorism-related sanctions against the IRGC as 
part of the Countering America’s Adver-
saries Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9401 
et seq.); 
Whereas, on May 21, 2018, the United States 
Government outlined steps that the Govern-
ment of Iran must take to normalize rela-
tions with the United States, including— 
(1) providing the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency a full account of the possible 
military dimensions of its nuclear program 
and permanently and verifiably abandoning 
that program; 
(2) ceasing all enrichment and vowing 
never to pursue plutonium reprocessing; 
(3) providing the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency with access to all sites through-
out the entire country; 
(4) ending its development and prolifera-
tion of ballistic missiles; 
(5) releasing all United States citizens cur-
rently held hostage, as well as citizens of 
countries that are partners and allies of the 
United States; 
(6) ending support for terrorist groups, in-
cluding Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Pales-
tinian Islamic Jihad;

(7) respecting the sovereignty of Iraq by 
demobilizing Iranian-controlled Shia mili-
tias in the country; 
(8) ending its military support for the 
Houthi militia in Yemen; 
(9) withdrawing all forces under Iranian 
command in Syria; 
(10) ending support for the Taliban in Af-
ghanistan and for senior al Qaeda leaders 
around the region; 
(11) ending the IRGC’s support for terror-
ists and militant partners around the world; 
and 
(12) 
halting 
its 
threatening 
behavior 
against its neighbors; 
Whereas President Donald Trump an-
nounced the withdrawal of the United States 
from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018, and gradu-
ally reimposed sanctions that were sus-
pended by the Obama administration under 
the JCPOA, depriving the regime of valuable 
funds that the regime could have used to 
support its malign activities; 
Whereas the JCPOA defined the sanctions 
that the Obama administration suspended 
under the JCPOA as ‘‘nuclear-related’’, but 
‘‘nuclear-related’’ is not a term recognized 
under existing United States statutory sanc-
tions related to Iran; 
Whereas the Obama administration agreed 
to define the most significant bilateral sanc-
tions imposed by the United States on Iran 
as ‘‘nuclear-related’’, waive the application 
of those sanctions under the JCPOA, and 
commit the executive branch to work to re-
peal the provisions of law providing for those 
sanctions upon the expiration of the JCPOA; 
Whereas, pursuant to the terms of the 
JCPOA, sanctions were lifted on Iranian fi-
nancial institutions, cargo vessels, aircraft, 
fraudulent charities, and other entities that 
were not linked to Iran’s nuclear program, 
but were sanctioned for illicit conduct; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 401(a) of the 
Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Account-
ability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 
8551(a)), in order to terminate sanctions 
against the Central Bank of Iran and other 
Iranian financial institutions, the President 
is required to certify that ‘‘the Government 
of Iran. . .no longer satisfies the require-
ments for designation as a state sponsor of 
terrorism’’, and that ‘‘Iran has ceased the 
pursuit, acquisition, and development of, and 
verifiably dismantled its, nuclear, biological, 
and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles 
and ballistic missile launch technology’’; 
Whereas, on March 12, 2020, President 
Trump extended the national emergency de-
clared by Executive Order 12957 (50 U.S.C. 
1701 note; relating to prohibiting certain 
transactions with respect to the develop-
ment of Iranian petroleum resources) fol-
lowing a determination that Iran’s malign 
activities pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the United States; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
has determined that the IRGC and its affili-
ated entities have a dominant presence in 
Iran’s commercial and financial sectors and 
maintain extensive economic interests in the 
defense, construction, aviation, oil, banking, 
metal, automobile, and mining industries; 
Whereas, on October 8, 2020, the Secretary 
of the Treasury designated the financial sec-
tor of Iran for the imposition of sanctions, 
authorizing sanctions with respect to per-
sons operating in Iran’s construction, min-
ing, manufacturing, and textile sectors, to 
deny the Government of Iran financial re-
sources that may be used to fund and support 
its malign activities; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has sanctioned Iranian entities for their sup-
port to, or association with, Iran’s terrorism 
campaigns, ballistic missile program, or the 
Supreme Leader of Iran, including the Cen-
tral Bank of Iran, the National Development 
Fund of Iran, elements of the IRGC, Foreign 
Minister Javad Zarif, and entities in Iran’s 
banking, petroleum, and industrial sectors; 
Whereas, in February 2020, the Financial 
Action Task Force, the global anti-money 
laundering standard-setting body, fully lift-
ed the suspension of countermeasures and 
called on its members and urged all jurisdic-
tions to apply effective countermeasures re-
lating to the terrorist financing risk ema-
nating from Iran and the threat that poses to 
the international financial system; 
Whereas the United States Government, 
under Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations, has concluded that Iran provides a 
safe haven for al Qaeda leaders and that the 
al Qaeda network has used Iran to establish 
a ‘‘core pipeline’’ through which money, 
facilitators, and operators moved to Afghani-
stan and Pakistan; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has sanctioned entities in the Government of 
Iran for perpetrating human rights abuses; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 8 of the Iran 
Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–172; 50 
U.S.C. 1701 note), in order to terminate sanc-
tions imposed with respect to the energy sec-
tor of Iran, the President is required to cer-
tify ‘‘that Iran— 
‘‘(1) has ceased its efforts to design, de-
velop, manufacture, or acquire— 
‘‘(A) a nuclear explosive device or related 
materials and technology; 
‘‘(B) chemical and biological weapons; 
and 
‘‘(C) ballistic missiles and ballistic mis-
sile launch technology; 
‘‘(2) has been removed from the list of 
countries the governments of which have 
been determined. . .to have repeatedly pro-
vided support for acts of international ter-
rorism; and 
‘‘(3) poses no significant threat to United 
States national security, interests, or al-
lies.’’; and 
Whereas the concept of ‘‘nuclear-related’’ 
sanctions does not exist in statute, and ex-
isting statutes likely require a treaty to ter-
minate such sanctions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms that it is the policy of the 
United States not to allow Iran to develop or 
otherwise acquire a nuclear weapons capa-
bility; 
(2) resolves that the lifting or termination 
of sanctions with respect to Iran must take 
place only as provided for under section 
401(a) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 
(22 U.S.C. 8551(a)) and section 8 of the Iran 
Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–172; 50 
U.S.C. 1701 note); 
(3) rejects and opposes the reapplication of 
sanctions relief, including the use of waivers, 
de-listing individuals or entities, or the ap-
plication of licenses, provided for in, or inci-
dent to, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion, including on any sectors of the Iranian 
economy or any individuals or entities des-
ignated for the imposition of sanctions under 
United States law for supporting terrorism, 
missile 
development 
and 
proliferation, 
human rights abuses, corruption, or Iran’s 
other destabilizing activities; 
(4) opposes reversing the finding that iden-
tifies Iran as a jurisdiction of primary 
money laundering concern under section 
5318A of title 31, United States Code; 
(5) opposes the lifting of the ‘‘U-Turn’’ pro-
hibition, which bans Iran from accessing the 
United States financial system for the pur-
pose of conducting dollarized transactions; 
and 
(6) opposes the suspension or lifting of the 
call for countermeasures by the Financial 
Action Task Force on the Iranian financial 
sector until Iran fully completes its action 
plan.

Ms. ROSEN (for herself and Mr. 
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 73 
Whereas the principle that an informed 
and engaged electorate is critical to a vi-
brant democracy is deeply rooted in our laws 
of free speech and underpins the virtues on 
which we established our Constitution, ‘‘in 
Order to form a more perfect Union, estab-
lish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, 
provide for the common defence, promote 
the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings 
of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity 
. . .’’; 
Whereas having independent, diverse, and 
local media that provide exposure to a broad 
range of viewpoints and the ability to con-
tribute to the political debate is central to 
sustaining that informed engagement; 
Whereas it is in the public interest to en-
courage source, content, and audience diver-
sity on our Nation’s shared telecommuni-
cations and media platforms; 
Whereas 
the 
survival 
of small, inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets that 
serve diverse audiences and local media mar-
kets is essential to preserving local culture 
and building understanding on important 
community issues that impact the daily 
lives of residents; 
Whereas research by the American Society 
of News Editors, the Radio Television Digital 
News Association, the Pew Research Center, 
and others has documented the continued 
challenges of increasing diversity among all 
types of media entities; 
Whereas with increasing media experience 
and sophistication, it is even more impor-
tant to have minority participation in local 
media to ensure a diverse range of informa-
tion sources are available and different ideas 
and viewpoints are expressed to strengthen 
social cohesion among different commu-
nities; and 
Whereas the constriction in small, inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets and lim-
ited participation of diverse populations in 
media ownership and decisionmaking are 
combining to negatively impact our goal of 
increasing local civic engagement and civic 
knowledge through increased voter partici-
pation, membership in civic groups, and 
knowledge of local political and civil infor-
mation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity 
as a core tenet of the public interest stand-
ard in media policy; and 
(2) pledges to work with media entities and 
diverse stakeholders to develop common 
ground solutions to eliminate barriers to 
media diversity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S867 
February 24, 2021 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 74 
Whereas a rare disease or disorder is a dis-
ease or disorder that affects a small number 
of patients; 
Whereas, in the United States, a rare dis-
ease or disorder typically affects fewer than 
200,000 individuals; 
Whereas, as of the date of the adoption of 
this resolution, more than 7,000 rare diseases 
or disorders affect approximately 1 in 10 indi-
viduals in the United States; 
Whereas children with rare diseases or dis-
orders account for a significant portion of 
the population affected by rare diseases or 
disorders in the United States; 
Whereas many rare diseases and disorders 
are serious and life-threatening and lack ef-
fective treatments; 
Whereas, as a result of the enactment of 
the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97–414; 96 
Stat. 2049), important advances have been 
made in the research and treatment of rare 
diseases and disorders; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-
tion has made strides in gathering patient 
perspectives to inform the drug review proc-
ess as part of the Patient-Focused Drug De-
velopment program, an initiative that was 
reaffirmed under the FDA Reauthorization 
Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–52; 131 Stat. 1005); 
Whereas, although the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has approved more than 880 or-
phan indications for drugs and biological 
products for the treatment of rare diseases 
and disorders, 90 percent of individuals in the 
United States with a rare disease or disorder 
are not receiving an FDA-approved treat-
ment for their condition; 
Whereas limited treatment options and dif-
ficulty obtaining reimbursement for life-al-
tering and lifesaving treatments can be chal-
lenging for individuals with rare diseases or 
disorders and their families; 
Whereas rare diseases and disorders in-
clude sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular at-
rophy, common variable immune deficiency, 
median arcuate ligament syndrome, gly-
cogen storage disease type V, pulmonary hy-
pertension, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, sar-
coidosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 
autosomal recessive polycystic kidney dis-
ease; 
Whereas individuals with rare diseases or 
disorders can experience difficulty in obtain-
ing accurate diagnoses and finding physi-
cians or treatment centers with expertise in 
their rare disease or disorder; 
Whereas the 116th Congress passed a 4-year 
extension of the Rare Pediatric Disease Pri-
ority Review Voucher program under section 
529(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act (21 U.S.C. 360ff(b)) as part of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub-
lic Law 116–260; 134 Stat. 1182), providing an 
incentive for the development of therapies 
for children with rare diseases; 
Whereas the 116th Congress passed the Ad-
vancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (Pub-
lic Law 116–16; 133 Stat. 852), improving ac-
cess to coordinated, patient-centered health 
care for children with complex and rare med-
ical conditions in Medicaid; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the National Institutes of Health 
support research on the treatment of rare 
diseases and disorders; 
Whereas 2021 marks the 38th anniversary of 
the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act (Pub-
lic Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049); 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each 
year on the last day of February; 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event 
that was first observed in the United States 
on February 28, 2009, and was observed in 
more than 100 countries in 2020; and 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is expected to 
be observed globally for years to come, pro-
viding hope and information for rare disease 
and disorder patients around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates February 28, 2021, as ‘‘Rare 
Disease Day’’; and 
(2) recognizes the importance of, with re-
spect to rare diseases and disorders— 
(A) improving awareness; 
(B) encouraging accurate and early diag-
nosis; and 
(C) supporting national and global efforts 
to develop effective treatments, diagnostics,

Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mrs. BLACKBURN, and 
Mr. HOEVEN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 75 
Whereas, in 1776, people envisioned the 
United States as a new nation dedicated to 
the proposition stated in the Declaration of 
Independence that ‘‘all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable Rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty and the pur-
suit of Happiness’’; 
Whereas Africans were first brought invol-
untarily to the shores of the United States 
as early as the 17th century; 
Whereas African Americans suffered en-
slavement and subsequently faced the injus-
tices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial 
of the basic and fundamental rights of citi-
zenship; 
Whereas, in 2021, the vestiges of those in-
justices and inequalities remain evident in 
the society of the United States; 
Whereas, in the face of injustices, people of 
good will and of all races in the United 
States have distinguished themselves with a 
commitment to the noble ideals on which 
the United States was founded and have 
fought courageously for the rights and free-
dom of African Americans and others; 
Whereas African Americans, such as Lieu-
tenant Colonel Allen Allensworth, Maya 
Angelou, Arthur Ashe, Jr., James Baldwin, 
James Beckwourth, Clara Brown, Blanche 
Bruce, Ralph Bunche, Shirley Chisholm, Holt 
Collier, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Larry

along with many others, worked against rac-
ism to achieve success and to make signifi-
cant contributions to the economic, edu-
cational, political, artistic, athletic, lit-
erary, scientific, and technological advance-
ment of the United States; 
Whereas 
the 
contributions 
of 
African 
Americans from all walks of life throughout 
the history of the United States reflect the 
greatness of the United States; 
Whereas many African Americans lived, 
toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving 
the recognition those individuals deserved, 
and yet paved the way for future generations 
to succeed; 
Whereas African Americans continue to 
serve the United States at the highest levels 
of business, government, and the military; 
Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln 
and Frederick Douglass inspired the creation 
of Negro History Week, the precursor to 
Black History Month; 
Whereas Negro History Week represented 
the culmination of the efforts of Dr. Carter 
G. Woodson, the ‘‘Father of Black History’’, 
to enhance knowledge of Black history 
through The Journal of Negro History, pub-
lished by the Association for the Study of 
African American Life and History, which 
was founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and 
Jesse E. Moorland; 
Whereas Black History Month, celebrated 
during the month of February, originated in 
1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set aside a 
special period in February to recognize the 
heritage and achievements of Black people 
in the United States; 
Whereas Dr. Carter G. Woodson stated, 
‘‘We have a wonderful history behind us. . . 
If you are unable to demonstrate to the 
world that you have this record, the world 
will say to you, ‘You are not worthy to enjoy 
the blessings of democracy or anything 
else.’ ’’; 
Whereas, since its founding, the United 
States has imperfectly progressed toward 
noble goals; 
Whereas the history of the United States is 
the story of people regularly affirming high 
ideals, striving to reach those ideals but 
often failing, and then struggling to come to 
terms with the disappointment of that fail-
ure, before committing to try again; 
Whereas, on November 4, 2008, the people of 
the United States elected Barack Obama, an 
African-American man, as President of the 
United States; and 
Whereas, on February 22, 2012, people 
across the United States celebrated the 
groundbreaking of the National Museum of 
African 
American 
History 
and 
Culture, 
which opened to the public on September 24, 
2016, on the National Mall in Washington,

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is 
the end of February. Almost exactly a 
year ago, America was getting its first 
cases of COVID–19, and they were being 
reported in the media. We were learn-
ing about it but didn’t know much at 
that point. We knew it spread across 
China. We knew what was happening 
there. But in the weeks ahead and by 
the middle of March, just a few weeks 
from now, our country started going 
into lockdown. 
We experienced something we had 
never experienced as a country: a man-
datory shutdown across the entire 
country, followed by instructions to 
senior 
adults 
and 
people 
with 
comorbidities to stay in their homes 
and not get out. For millions of those 
senior adults, they asked the same 
question almost a year ago: When can 
I get out of my home? When can I see 
people? And the answer consistently 
was: Once there is a vaccine. When we 
get a vaccine in place, this will be bet-
ter. We don’t know how long that will 
take, but once we get a vaccine, we will 
be able to turn this around. 
Seniors heard that over and over and 
over and over again for the last 111⁄2 
months. And, now, thankfully, millions 
of seniors have been vaccinated. We 
have 42 million Americans that have 
gone through the full regimen. In my 
State, almost 20 percent of the adults 
in my State have already had their 
vaccine. We are one of the top States in 
the country, by percentage, getting 
vaccines out to individuals. Almost 
every person in every assisted-living 
nursing home, critical care facility, 
staff, and residents have been vac-
cinated. Almost every single senior 
adult in my State has been fully vac-
cinated, and we are into the second 
round now of teachers and those with 
comorbidities and other folks that has 
already begun. 
But interestingly enough, seniors are 
still asking the same question. I had 
my shot. I had my second shot. It has 
now been the 10 days past my second 
shot, but nothing is changed. 
A couple of weeks ago, I asked CDC a 
very simple question. It is the question 
that I am getting asked that I continue 
to ask CDC. When will instructions 
come out on what seniors need to do 
now? Can they get out? Can they hug 
their 
grandkids? 
Can 
they 
go 
to 
Walmart? Can guests come to assisted- 
living facilities? 
They were all together during Christ-
mas and Halloween and now Valen-
tine’s Day, and they are used to having 
kids come in and sing songs and people 
come to visit them. None of that hap-
pened last year, and now, they are ask-
ing a simple question: When will CDC 
give guidelines for what happens now? 
CDC currently has said over and over 
again: Wait. We are thinking about it. 
We are researching it. 
CDC needs to act on this. Seniors 
have been cooped up for a year. They 
were told months ago, ‘‘Once you get a 
vaccine, this will get better,’’ and they 
are now finding they had their vaccine 
and nothing is getting better. They 
need hope. They need to know the next 
step. 
So my simple challenge to CDC has 
been: Do for the seniors what you did 
for the schools. CDC put out extensive

guidelines: here is how schools can re-
open, it is safe to reopen for schools, 
here is what needs to be done. Help our 
seniors out by getting clear guidelines 
out into the public. Give instructions 
to assisted-living facilities; give in-
structions to these grandparents. What 
do they need to do now that they have 
been vaccinated? How much travel can 
they have? What are the risks? And let 
them make the decisions on it. 
Folks are counting on them to be 
able to lay some of the science out 
there, and it is time to get the infor-
mation out to those folks so they can 
make the right decision. CDC, we need 
you to step up. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk about 
the need for all of us to redouble our ef-
forts to combat drug addiction. One of 
the top priorities I have had in my 
time in public service has been to com-
bat this crisis, which has devastated so 
many families, destroyed so many 
communities, and impacted us in so 
many negative ways. 
Unfortunately, under the cover of the 
coronavirus pandemic, there is an epi-
demic that is growing, and that is the 
drug addiction epidemic. It is heart-
breaking because we actually had sev-
eral years of progress. We were making 
progress, finally, in turning the tide, 
and now, it is coming back with a 
vengeance to the point that overdoses 
and overdose deaths, hospitalizations, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
negative 
con-
sequences of drug addiction is being 
raised up again in the context of the 
coronavirus. 
Here, in the Congress, we have taken 
a leadership role on addressing this 
issue. Over the last several years, Con-
gress has appropriated billions of dol-
lars—and not that money solves every-
thing, but the money has been pretty 
well spent on programs that are actu-
ally tested, evidence-based programs 
on 
prevention, 
on 
treatment, 
and 
longer term recovery. 
Once called the Comprehensive Ad-
diction and Recovery Act, which I au-
thored with my colleague, SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE, on the other side of the 
aisle, there is other legislation, too, 
called the 21st Century Cures Act. All 
of this has provided help that goes 
down to the local level, the community 
level, to be able to create a network, to 
be able to push back against the addic-
tion crisis. 
In 2017, Ohio’s overdose opioid death 
rate was almost three times the na-
tional average. Ohio was one of the 
worst States in the country in terms of 
our opioid addiction. In terms of opioid 
deaths, we were top three in the coun-
try. It is not something you want to be 
at the top of. Nearly a dozen Ohioans 
were dying from these dangerous drugs 
every single day. This is in 2017. It sur-
passed car crashes as our country’s No. 
1 killer among young people and, for 
Ohio, the No. 1 overall. 
But that next year, in 2018, much of 
what we were doing here in Congress, 
the work again on the CARA Act, the 
Cures Act, and other things that were 
being done at the State level and local 
level that were being supported by our 
Federal legislation, they were starting 
to work. So, in 2018, Ohio led the coun-
try again, but this time it wasn’t in 
overdose deaths. It was in the reduc-
tion of overdose deaths. We actually 
had a 22-percent reduction from 2017 to 
2018. 
By the way, the same thing happened 
nationally. We had a reduction in over-
dose deaths nationally in 2018 for the 
first time since 1990. Think about that. 
From 1990 until 2018, every single year, 
we 
had 
more 
people 
dying 
from 
overdoses in this country, driven in 
large part by opioids, and, more re-
cently, by the most deadly of opioids, 
synthetic opioids like fentanyl and 
Carfentanil. 
Unfortunately, 
again, 
under 
the 
cover of this coronavirus pandemic, 
drug addiction has flourished, and that 
positive progress has been reversed. It 
is heartbreaking. While we need to re-
main 
committed 
to 
solving 
the 
healthcare challenges of COVID–19, 
there is increasing evidence that the 
stresses of this unprecedented time are 
driving a spike in drug abuse and sub-
sequent overdoses, this making 2020 the 
worst year in the history of our coun-
try in terms of overdose deaths and 
other measurements of drug addiction. 
Why? Well, I have asked a lot of peo-
ple that. Common sense would tell you 
people are lonelier. Many people are 
distraught. Maybe they have lost their 
job. Maybe they have had someone in 
their family die of COVID–19. People 
are feeling anxious. People are unable 
to access recovery programs in person, 
so they can’t go sit down with their re-
covery coach, which they might have 
been able to do but for COVID–19 and 
the isolation that is required. Many of 
those in recovery from addiction are 
stalled in their progress, or they are 
suffering from relapses. 
There is a story that ran last week 
about a record number of overdose 
deaths in my home State of Ohio. It 
was on FOX 8 in Cleveland. One of the 
people they interviewed was a Cleve-
land woman who had lost her son to an 
overdose. It was pretty powerful. She 
talked about how important it is for 
people fighting addiction to have that 
network of support. It was hard to find 
during COVID–19. She said: ‘‘An addict 
needs to talk to someone, they need 
constant reassuring from their support 
group.’’ 
She is right. There are a lot of trou-
bling statistics out there that should 
be a cause for concern and a call to ac-
tion for all of us. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control reported that more than 
81,000 people died of drug overdoses in 
the 12 months ending in May 20 of 2020, 
the highest 12-month total in our Na-
tion’s history. So, again, it looks like 
2020 is going to be the worst year ever. 
The American Medical Association 
reports that more than 40 States have 
reported an increase in opioid-related 
deaths during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
A recent study in the JAMA Psychi-
atry journal found that a 45-percent in-
crease was the overdose death increase 
in emergency rooms from April to Oc-
tober of 2020 compared to that same 
time in 2019. 
It would be worse, in my view, with-
out 
the 
Federal 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, including some 
measures to ensure those suffering 
from addiction can continue to get the 
care they need through telehealth. We 
have cut redtape. We have provided 
some regulatory relief to expand tele-
health and telehealth options specifi-
cally for opioid treatment, like elimi-
nating requirements for in-person vis-
its before prescribing lifesaving drugs 
like buprenorphine. 
Without these expanded services, I 
believe the overdose spike would be 
even worse. Although there is no sub-
stitute for face-to-face interaction to 
help along an individual’s journey to 
recovery, telehealth has kept patients 
in touch with their doctors at least and 
allowed physicians to prescribe medi-
cation-assisted treatment remotely. 
In talking to those who are recovery 
coaches or those doctors back home 
who specialize in addiction, they tell 
me they believe that the telehealth op-
tion has been extremely important, so 
even though it has gotten worse, it 
would have gotten even worse if people 
had not had at least the ability to ac-
cess their recovery program through a 
remote means. 
Interestingly, these telehealth op-
tions for addiction treatments were put 
in place temporarily, but they have 
proven to be such a viable option for 
addiction treatment that now people 
are talking about making them perma-
nent. I agree with that. I don’t think it 
makes sense to get away from them as 
this pandemic goes away, which is why 
yesterday, along with my colleague, 
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, I entered this 
legislation called the Telehealth Re-
sponse 
for 
E-Prescribing 
Addiction 
Services Treatment Act. The reason 
that is such a long name is we wanted 
to make the acronym TREATS, which 
it is. The TREATS Act makes perma-
nent a number of temporary waivers 
for telehealth services and bolsters 
telehealth options for addiction treat-
ment services. 
Let’s turn to a couple of things spe-
cifically. First, it allows for a patient 
to be prescribed lower-scheduled drugs 
like Suboxone through a telehealth 
visit on their first visit, as opposed to 
having to go in person for that first 
visit. 
Current law requires an in-person 
visit when you need an initial prescrip-
tion for controlled substances, but this 
has been a real deterrent for patients 
in crisis and in urgent need of treat-
ments from Schedule III or Schedule

IV drugs like Suboxone or certain 
drugs for reoccurring mental health 
conditions, so our bill is important in 
that regard. 
It also limits abusive practices by 
limiting telehealth visits to those who 
have both audio and video capabilities 
to be able to interact with the treat-
ment providers to reduce fraud and 
abuse when it is your first visit. It 
would also keep the existing require-
ments for in-person visits when pre-
scribing Schedule II drugs like opioids 
or stimulants that are more prone to 
being abused during these telehealth 
visits. So we have provisions in there 
to avoid abuse, but it is important to 
continue this telehealth option when 
other options just aren’t there. 
Second, our bill would allow for 
Medicare to bill for audio-only or tele-
phone telehealth services for mental 
health and substance abuse treatment 
if it is not the patient’s first visit. Due 
to distance or access to broadband, in- 
person visits or even video appoint-
ments aren’t always possible for our 
seniors. We still need to focus on safety 
and robust treatment options, but in 
order to balance the needs of patients, 
we propose to allow our Nation’s sen-
iors under Medicare to use phones for 
subsequent mental health or behav-
ioral health visits when they don’t 
have access to the internet and where 
face-to-face interaction just isn’t as 
necessary. 
I believe this TREATS legislation 
will make a difference in the addiction 
treatment space and will help us pre-
vent more untimely overdoses, but it is 
also important that we ensure that law 
enforcement officials can continue to 
go after the supply of lethal drugs com-
ing into our communities, lethal drugs 
that are fueling these overdoses. 
The most important thing, in my 
view, is reducing the demand dealing 
with prevention, treatment, and recov-
ery, but by stopping some of the flow of 
these drugs, among other things, you 
are reducing the supply, which raises 
the cost of these drugs on the street. 
And, unfortunately, some of these 
drugs are unbelievably inexpensive, 
given how incredibly powerful and 
deadly they can be. 
Data from the Center for Disease 
Control shows that the biggest driver 
of these surge in overdose deaths has 
been the class of drugs called synthetic 
opioids. We talked about that a mo-
ment ago. They are far deadlier than 
the traditional opioids like heroin but 
still cause far too many overdoses. 
The most well known of these drugs, 
fentanyl, is about 50 times deadlier 
than heroin, and it is often less expen-
sive. It is illegally manufactured pri-
marily in China, and then it is smug-
gled across our southern border or 
through the U.S. mail. A pound of 
fentanyl is lethal enough to kill half a 
million people. Think about that. One 
pound is enough to kill half a million 
people. 
We have made some progress keeping 
it out of the mail system. The STOP 
Act is now in effect. We are working 
with the Postal Service and also work-
ing with Customs and Border Protec-
tion to properly implement that legis-
lation, which I authored on a bipar-
tisan basis here several years ago, and 
it is finally being implemented to keep 
our mail system from delivering poison 
into our communities. 
But the traffickers have changed pat-
terns, and a lot of it is now going to 
Mexico and then coming over land 
across our southern border. 
Across the country, law enforcement 
have had their hands full trying to stop 
the flow of synthetic opioids. Ohio 
State Patrol troopers seized a total of 
129 pounds of fentanyl last year, 
enough to kill more than 60 million 
people. We have 11.8 million people in 
Ohio, but our troopers, just in Ohio, 
seized enough fentanyl to kill 60 mil-
lion people. 
In one Ohio county, Cuyahoga Coun-
ty, there were more than 1,700 seizures 
of fentanyl by law enforcement in 2020. 
One DEA initiative to fight drug traf-
ficking that started just last August of 
2020 has resulted in the seizure of near-
ly 440 pounds of fentanyl. 
Fentanyl itself is a schedule II drug, 
which means that law enforcement is 
able to take appropriate actions to 
crack down on it, and that is good. But 
there 
is 
a 
hidden 
challenge 
with 
fentanyl, and that is that manufactur-
ers can alter its chemical makeup in a 
lab to make what is known as a 
fentanyl analog or a copycat. It is all 
synthetic. So if some evil chemist 
somewhere can adjust the formula and 
make it an analog, it is not subject to 
the schedule II charges that law en-
forcement 
can 
bring. 
Because 
the 
chemical 
makeup 
is 
different 
in 
fentanyl, it is not automatically illegal 
at all, in fact. What is worse, these 
copycats can often be deadlier than 
fentanyl—take, 
for 
instance, 
carfentanil, which is 100 times as dead-
ly as fentanyl and about 10,000 times 
more deadly than morphine. Just han-
dling carfentanil, if you were to spill 
some on yourself, can kill you. 
In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Agen-
cy, DEA, made the right call by tempo-
rarily making these fentanyl-related 
substances illegal to possess, transport, 
or manufacture. Thanks to that des-
ignation, our law enforcement officials 
have been better able to protect our 
communities by seizing and destroying 
these fentanyl-related substances. 
Unfortunately, the temporary exten-
sion by DEA ends in only a few months. 
After May 6, 2021, these incredibly dan-
gerous substances will no longer be 
subject to strict regulation by law en-
forcement. It will be easier for drug 
manufacturers in China and elsewhere 
to 
flood 
the 
United 
States 
with 
carfentanil 
and 
other 
synthetic 
opioids. We can’t allow that to happen. 
Of course, we can’t allow that to hap-
pen, which is why yesterday I intro-
duced the bipartisan Federal Initiative 
to Guarantee Health by Targeting 
Fentanyl, or FIGHT Fentanyl Act, 
along with my colleague Senator JOE 
MANCHIN from West Virginia, another 
State that has been devastated by the 
opioid epidemic. Our bill simply codi-
fies the existing DEA precedent to per-
manently 
schedule 
fentanyl-related 
substances, allowing our law enforce-
ment officials to continue to crack 
down on synthetic opioid in all of its 
forms. Let’s provide some certainty, 
some predictability here, and make 
this permanent. 
Just as importantly, it is going to 
send a signal to both the American 
people and the manufacturers and 
smugglers 
that 
produce 
synthetic 
opioids that we have not forgotten 
about this threat, and we are going to 
do everything in our power to keep 
these deadly drugs out of our commu-
nities. 
The FIGHT Fentanyl Act and the 
TREATS Act are a couple of things 
that we could do right now on a bipar-
tisan basis, and we should. I urge my 
colleagues to support them. 
But we have a lot more work to do in 
the months ahead. The authorization 
for the Comprehensive Addiction Re-
covery Act, the CARA bill we talked 
about earlier, expires in fiscal year 
2023. And Senator WHITEHOUSE and I 
will soon introduce a CARA 2.0 Act to 
build on the successes of CARA with an 
unprecedented investment in expand-
ing access to proven treatment and re-
covery programs—again, programs that 
are shown to work by evidence for 
treatment and recovery than longer 
term recovery. 
CARA 2.0 includes dozens of provi-
sions to address addiction from all 
fronts—research and education, treat-
ment and recovery, criminal justice re-
form, dealing with prescription drugs— 
making it the most comprehensive leg-
islation in our country’s history. When 
added with the existing CARA pro-
grams that are reauthorized through 
2023, we would be investing well over $1 
billion to address this longstanding 
epidemic, again, at a time when under 
the pandemic the epidemic is growing. 
We need to be sure that as we con-
tinue to invest in the coronavirus vac-
cine development and distribution, we 
are also focusing on this epidemic. As 
we come out of this coronavirus pan-
demic—and I believe we are starting to 
see some signs of that—let’s be sure we 
are not leaving in its wake more and 
more deaths and more and more addic-
tion with regard to the drug addiction 
crisis. 
We need to all recognize the urgency 
of working to reverse this surge and 
nationwide 
overdoses 
and 
overdose 
deaths. 
As 
we 
emerge 
from 
this 
coronavirus pandemic, let’s act now to 
ensure we have the tools in place to 
also turn the tide on this disease and 
get those affected the help they need. 
I yield my time.

IN RECOGNITION OF MIGUEL 
PEREZ 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Miguel Perez upon 
his appointment to serve as manager of the 
Altoona Curve for 2021’s minor league sea-
son, which will be Mr. Perez’s 14th season in 
the Pittsburgh Pirates’ system. 
Mr. Perez will be the first former Altoona 
Curve player to serve as the team’s manager. 
Prior to his appointment as manager of the Al-
toona Curve, he served as a manager for the 
West Virginia Power, the Greensboro Grass-
hoppers, and the Bristol Pirates. 
Mr. Perez began his career as a baseball 
player in 2000 with the Cincinnati Reds, and 
made his major league debut with the Reds in 
2005. He played for the Altoona Curve in 
2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013. During his ten-
ure with the Altoona Curve, he appeared in 92 
games and hit .271 with 36 RBIs. 
It is my honor to congratulate Mr. Perez on 
his appointment as manager of the Altoona 
Curve and welcome him back to Altoona. As 
the 2021 season begins, I wish Mr. Perez and 
the Altoona Curve team a safe, healthy, and 
successful season ahead.

EQUALITY ACT 
HON. SUSAN WILD 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, if the Equality 
Act is signed into law, millions of our fellow 
Americans will, for the first time, no longer be 
subject to discrimination based on their sexual 
orientation or gender identity. Barriers across 
our society—in essential areas like housing, 
employment, credit, and education—will finally 
come down. 
In reflecting on this legislation, I can’t help 
thinking about my uncle Wes, who grew up 
during the Depression. As a young man, he 
was never able to come out to his family be-
cause he didn’t think they’d accept him for it. 
Later in life, he did come out—living as a 
proud, gay man in Alabama. He passed away 
last year, and when I cast my vote for this leg-
islation, I’ll be thinking of him. 
I’ll also be thinking of the many messages 
I’ve gotten since I was first sworn in from 
young LGBTQ people in my community. 
They’ve shared their stories with me, and I’ve 
been inspired by their courage. I want them to 
know that this country belongs every bit as 
much to them—and that they have the right to 
a life of dignity and respect. That is what’s at 
stake in this vote. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY 
OF 
BISHOP 
CHARLES 
E. 
DAVIS 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate and celebrate the life of an ex-
traordinary and influential figure from Chi-
cago’s South Side, Bishop Charles Edward 
Davis. A native of Leland, Mississippi, Bishop 
Davis’s life was guided by service to his coun-
try, his community, and his faith. After grad-
uating high school in 1940, Bishop Davis relo-
cated to Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood, 
at the beginning of the Second Great Migra-
tion and the year before the United States en-
tered World War II. Heeding the call to serve 
his country after the outbreak of war, Bishop 
Davis joined the U.S. Army at the age of 19, 
serving as a sergeant. In the Army, Bishop 
Davis would complete tours of duty in Ger-
many, France, and Holland. 
After the war, Bishop Davis would enter the 
upholstery business with his dear friend Broth-
er James McDonald, a step which would lead 
him towards his lifetime of faith and good 
works. Brother McDonald’s mother-in-law, Sis-
ter Anastasia Anderson, introduced him to the 
Indiana Avenue Pentecostal Church of God 
(IPC), and he became a member of the 
church in 1954 when it was under the pas-
torate of Elder Charles Ellis. 
Recognizing the deep faith, commitment, 
and talent of Bishop Davis, Elder Ellis’s suc-
cessor, Elder Odee Akines, encouraged the 
further development of his faith and leader-
ship. With Elder Akines at the helm of IPC, 
Bishop Davis served as the church’s Sunday 
School superintendent, Young People’s Lead-
er, and President of the senior choir. By his 
side throughout his energetic leadership of the 
church was Dr. Geraldine Olivia Davis, his 
dear wife of 43 years until her passing in 
1998. Bishop Davis was also a devoted father 
to a son, Larney Bush, Jr., and a daughter, 
Yolanda Davis. 
After Elder Akines passed away in 1970, 
Bishop Davis was elected pastor of IPC. Him-
self a Doctor of Divinity and Master of The-
ology, Bishop Davis made this a central focus 
during his leadership of IPC, establishing 
scholarships and programs for young people 
seeking to further their educations in both the 
secular and Christian traditions. In 1986, 
Bishop Davis was elevated to the Bishopric by 
the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, 
serving as a Diocesan Bishop in New York 
State, Washington State, and Wyoming, even-
tually accepting a role as Diocesan of the 6th 
Episcopal District of the Pentecostal Assem-
blies of the World, their Illinois District Council, 
in 2008. 
Bishop Davis would come to be widely rec-
ognized as one of the Pentecostal Assemblies 
of the World’s most exemplary leaders, ad-
mired both in Chicago and nationally for his 
character and conviction. This caused him to 
become fondly known as ‘‘Chief.’’ Bishop 
Davis was a mentor to many young people 
who came to his churches seeking salvation, 
and always conducted robust community out-
reach efforts, making sure that his good works 
did not only benefit IPC, but the entire neigh-
borhood and city. Bishop Davis’s work was 
recognized by the City of Chicago in 1992, 
when the 3500–3600 block of South Indiana 
Avenue was named in his honor. 
In 2004, Bishop Davis became united in 
marriage with Dr. Jessie Davis, and they were 
inseparable from one another, always working 
together for the spiritual benefit of their com-
munity. They would remain by each other’s 
sides until Dr. Davis’s death in April of 2020. 
Madam Speaker, on February 9th, Bishop 
Davis was called to heaven after a lifetime of 
good works. My deepest prayers and sym-
pathies go out to Bishop Davis’s family, 
friends, and the IPC community on the pass-
ing of this supremely devoted and talented 
leader, who gave so much in service to his 
faith, community, and country.

IN RECOGNITION OF RAFAEL A. 
MELGAR 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Master Sergeant 
Rafael A. Melgar of Altoona, Pennsylvania on 
his retirement after 20 years of service in the 
United States Air Force. 
Sergeant Melgar enlisted in the Air Force in 
2000. His service has included six years of ac-
tive duty with the 74th Fighter Squadron, the 
23rd Fighter Wing, at Pope Air Force Base, 
North Carolina as an A–10, F–15, and U–2 
Avionics Systems Journeyman. He also has 
served with the 152nd Medical Squadron at 
the Reno-Tahoe International Airport as a Bio-
medical Equipment Repair Technician. Cur-
rently, he is a Biomedical Equipment Support 
Specialist at the James E. Van Zandt VA Med-
ical Center in Altoona, Pennsylvania. 
Sergeant Melgar deployed in support of Op-
eration: Southern Watch, Operation: Enduring 
Freedom, and Operation: Iraqi Freedom. Dur-
ing his service, he earned the Air Force 
Achievement Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster. 
Sergeant Melgar is an outstanding American 
and Pennsylvanian. It is my honor to recog-
nize his distinguished service to our nation 
and to our community. On behalf of Penn-
sylvania’s 13th Congressional District, I con-
gratulate Sergeant Melgar on his retirement 
and wish him the best as he and his family 
embark on a new chapter.

HONORING DR. HEIDI SHRECK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Dr. Heidi Shreck, a pediatrician who 
serves as Chief Medical Officer for Primary 
Health Care, a community health center local 
in central Iowa. Dr. Shreck is a dedicated, 
trusted physician who works each day to sup-
port the health of our communities, and it is 
my distinct honor to name her Iowan of the 
Week. 
Dr. Shreck leads with care and compassion, 
and she is committed to achieving excellence. 
If you were to ask any of her patients—or the 
parents of some of her littler patients—they 
would without doubt echo that her kindness, 
devotion, and concern for their health and 
wellbeing is at the core of everything she 
does. 
PHC offers high-quality, affordable care to 
underserved and vulnerable populations in 
Des Moines, Ames, and Marshalltown. As 
Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Shreck helps ensure 
these patients receive comprehensive health 
services, including medical and dental care, 
behavioral health care, homeless support, and 
pharmacy services. In 2019, PHC provided 
care for more than 38,000 Iowans. 
Dr. Shreck has been instrumental in ad-
vancing the care-driven mission of community 
health centers in Iowa. When we began to see 
cases of COVID–19 in our state, Dr. Shreck 
led PHC’ s early response efforts and coordi-
nated with other healthcare organizations to 
establish a community-wide strategy. She has 
continued to lead our medical, dental, and be-
havioral health staff through the challenging 
circumstances of the past nine months. 
PHC’s 
staff—including 
Dr. 
Shreck—has 
gone above and beyond to make sure patients 
and clients received continuing health care 
from the onset of this pandemic. Their accom-
plishments are truly too many to list, so I’d like 
to highlight a few. 
With Dr. Shreck’s leadership, PHC medical 
staff rapidly adapted to providing care in new 
ways. For example, behavioral health pro-
viders worked alongside primary care teams to 
set up telehealth systems to meet increasing 
demand for mental health care among kids 
and adults during this pandemic. In the early 
days of the pandemic when most dental of-
fices had to shutter, dedicated dental teams 
juggled work adjustments, staffing challenges, 
and new requirements for PPE in order to pro-
vide emergency care—which kept patients 
healthy while ensuring emergency room space 
remained available to treat those with COVID– 
19. 
I cannot thank Dr. Shreck enough for her 
hard work and resolve in the face of this threat 
to the health of communities across Iowa. De-
spite the long hours, stress, and concern for 
their own families, friends, and neighbors, Dr. 
Shreck and her team keep showing up to pro-
vide exceptional care. They do so with com-
passion, dignity, and respect; their resolve is 
deeply humbling. 
It is Iowans like Dr. Shreck who embody 
Iowans commitment to community and serv-
ice. I thank her once again for her achieve-
ments, and it is my distinct honor to name her 
this week’s Iowan of the Week. 
RECOGNIZING PHIL MATIER 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, along 
with Speaker of the House NANCY PELOSI and 
Representatives MARK DESAULNIER, ANNA G. 
ESHOO, JARED HUFFMAN, RO KHANNA, BAR-
BARA LEE, ZOE LOFGREN, JERRY MCNERNEY, 
JACKIE SPEIER, and MIKE THOMPSON, I rise to 
recognize California journalist Phil Matier on 
the occasion of his retirement from the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
Phil for decades has enlightened and enter-
tained Bay Area readers with his well-sourced, 
trenchant columns. He has helped to clearly 
explain our region’s ups and downs to genera-
tions of residents, often shining light on details 
that politicians and the well-connected would 
have preferred to keep hidden. 
Phil, a graduate of the University of Arizona, 
worked at the Tucson (AZ) Citizen before join-
ing the San Francisco Examiner in the 1980s 
to report on city hall, where he met and soon 
partnered with Andy Ross. A Matier & Ross 
column became a fixture first at the Examiner 
and then at the Chronicle, even as Phil also 
expanded his media footprint into work with 
Bay Area television and radio stations. 
Through his columns as well as his broad-
cast presence, Phil has explained the fine de-
tails of pressing issues, probed policymakers’ 
personalities and character, and pushed for 
accountability and transparency in govern-
ment. 
His uncanny ability to elicit information from 
political figures, whether or not they wish to 
share it, is legendary. And his own person-
ality—insightful, sometimes pugnacious, often 
expressed at high volume, but always fair— 
has shone through all of his work. 
We thank Phil for sharing his talents with 
generations of newspaper readers, and we are 
glad we will continue to see and hear his 
broadcasts.

APPRECIATING RUSH LIMBAUGH 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, America has lost a treasured Icon of 
Truth with the death of Rush Limbaugh. My 
wife Roxanne and our family and community 
extend our most sincere sympathy to his wife 
Kathryn and the Limbaugh Family. He was 
America’s Number One broadcaster with tens 
of millions of listeners in every community in 
America. 
Rush Limbaugh was the Ronald Reagan of 
broadcasting proving conservatism is positive, 
friendly, faith-based, and even funny as he 
itemized the Greatness of America never 
apologizing for Exceptionalism. 
Also, like President Reagan he achieved 
and promoted the American Dream that all 
can 
succeed 
with 
hard 
work. 
It 
was 
Reaganesque that he created thousands of 
jobs saving the AM Radio band enabling local 
hosts to penetrate daily newspapers’ mostly 
fake news. Local hosts are highlighted by tal-
ented truth tellers—Keven Cohen, Gary David, 
Carl Gooding, Paul Kirby, Kelly Nash, Jona-
than Rush, and Christopher Thompson. This is 
also a platform for affordable advertising by 
local businesses to create jobs. 
His logical, common sense explanation of 
American political issues was vital for conserv-
ative success. 
In 1994 he worked with speaker-to-be Newt 
Gingrich to achieve the first Republican House 
majority in my lifetime—leading to a Congres-
sional vote to establish the American Embassy 
in Jerusalem. 
In 2010 he encouraged the grassroots to 
become active with the spontaneous Tea 
Party movement gaining an incredible 63 
House seats. 
In 2016 he recognized outsider Donald 
Trump to unexpectedly be elected President to 
successfully create jobs with record employ-
ment for African Americans, Hispanics, Asian 
Americans, women, and youth. 
In 2020 in my home state of South Carolina 
he inspired young conservatives for additional 
State Senate, State House, and a Congres-
sional seat achieving the largest Republican 
majorities in 140 years. This follows Nikki 
Haley being elected the first female governor 
in 340 years and second Indian American in 
history with Senator TIM SCOTT being the 
South’s first African American U.S. Senator. 
Columbia’s Morning News host Gary David 
is correct that there has been no one who has 
impacted our political culture more than Rush 
Limbaugh without serving in public office. 
I saw firsthand the good-natured friendliness 
of Rush Limbaugh in 1990 when I served as 
his driver during his visit to Columbia for an 
address to the South Carolina Policy Council. 
He was not offended being crammed into our 
van with our four sons age 3 to 17 (helping in-
spire our son Alan to be elected America’s 
youngest state Attorney General in 2010). 
Last February 5th I was grateful to con-
gratulate him at the Capitol following his being 
presented the Medal of Freedom by President 
Donald Trump during his historic State of the 
Union address. The opinion show host was 
clearly humbled by this deserved recognition. 
It is so re-assuring that the Rush Limbaugh 
legacy will continue as excerpts from his 
broadcasts will remain on the air reinforcing 
how profound his love of America that are 
timeless.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate the New Oxford High 
School Marching Colonials on their victory in 
the V-USBands Pennsylvania State Cham-
pionship. 
The New Oxford High School Marching Co-
lonials include 52 students in grades 9–12. A 
competitive band for many years, the band 
persevered through the challenges of the 
COVID–19 pandemic and competed in the vir-
tual V-USBands circuit. From their home sta-
dium in New Oxford, the band designed a 
new, original field show called ‘‘Together,’’ 
which is intended to convey a message of 
unity.

RECOGNIZING JOHN DIAZ 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, along 
with Speaker of the House NANCY PELOSI and 
Representatives MARK DESAULNIER, ANNA G. 
ESHOO, JARED HUFFMAN, RO KHANNA, BAR-
BARA LEE, ZOE LOFGREN, JERRY MCNERNEY, 
JACKIE SPEIER, and MIKE THOMPSON, I rise to 
recognize California journalist John Diaz on 
the occasion of his retirement from the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
John’s superb stewardship of the Chron-
icle’s editorial pages over the past 25 years 
has kept California readers talking and think-
ing about the most pressing issues facing the 
state. His own columns, exploring complex 
issues in ways that laypeople can easily un-
derstand and engage, have been a big part of 
that. 
John, a graduate of California’s Humboldt 
State University, started his career at the Red 
Bluff (CA) Daily News, where after two years 
he was promoted to the parent company’s 
Washington, D.C. bureau. He later reported 
for the Associated Press in Philadelphia and 
reported and edited for the Denver Post be-
fore starting at the Chronicle in 1990 as an as-
sistant city editor and becoming its editorial 
page editor in 1996. 
Both in maintaining the Chronicle’s editorial 
voice and in expressing his own opinions and 
analysis through his column, John unflinch-
ingly has delved into tough issues without re-
sorting either to oversimplification or to mean- 
spiritedness. His balanced presentation of 
facts is a credit to the Chronicle and to jour-
nalism at large, and a boon to his readers. 
The Bay Area political landscape has 
changed enormously on his watch, as has the 
region’s media landscape. Through it all, John 
has kept our communities well-informed and a 
well-informed populace is a necessary part of 
our democratic republic. 
We thank John for his many years of serv-
ice to our constituents, and we wish him the 
best in his next endeavors.

ST. DAVID’S DAY 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
note the upcoming celebration of St. David’s 
Day on March 1. The feast day of St. David, 
the patron saint of Wales, offers the oppor-
tunity to honor Welsh culture and heritage and 
note the links between Wales and the United 
States. 
The Welsh were among the early settlers 
who emigrated from the British Isles to North 
America, and they came with the same moti-
vations that brought many generations from all 
over the world to our shores, including the 
pursuit of religious liberty and the opportunity 
to create a better life for themselves and their 
descendants. The man remembered as the 
first Welsh settler, Howell Powell, arrived in 
Virginia from Brecon in 1642. After William 
Penn founded Pennsylvania in 1681, having 
considered naming it New Wales, a large 
group of Welsh Quakers settled in the colony. 
A century later, the Industrial Revolution 
brought a renewed wave of Welsh settlement 
to the United States. Immigrants from Wales 
farmed land, mined coal, made steel, and 
worked in a variety of other industries that 
powered U.S. economic ascendancy. 
We see the contributions of Wales to Amer-
ican history and culture in other ways, too. At 
least five signers of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence had a Welsh background, including 
its primary author Thomas Jefferson. At least 
eight of our presidents have similarly come 
from Welsh descent. 
The ties between Wales and the United 
States are not merely historic but remain vi-
brant today. Welsh companies conduct busi-
ness in the United States and keep Americans 
on their payrolls. As of 2019, the United 
States was the largest export market for 
Wales outside Europe. 
In the House of Representatives, I serve as 
Chairman of the Congressional Friends of 
Wales Caucus, devoted to celebrating and 
strengthening the ties between our two na-
tions. Each year I look forward to our St. Da-
vid’s Day reception on Capitol Hill, attended 
by members of the Welsh community in the 
United States, leading officials in the Welsh 
government, and Members of Congress. Un-
fortunately, the reception will not go on as 
usual this year, but I will nevertheless be 
wearing a daffodil on March 1 to mark the hol-
iday. 
The last words of St. David were said to be, 
‘‘Be joyful, keep the faith, and do the little 
things that you have heard and seen me do.’’ 
People of Welsh heritage have come to em-
body this message in their contributions to the 
United States and have not done only little 
things but great things as well. On this St. Da-
vid’s Day, as one of the millions of Americans 
with Welsh ancestry, I take pride in the ac-
complishments produced by the partnership 
between Wales and the United States and 
look forward to those to come.

NEW DEAL FOR NEW AMERICANS 
ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, immigrants 
are an essential part of our nation. And our 
nation can only be made stronger if we assist 
the efforts of new Americans to integrate, con-
tribute to the growth of our economy, and be 
civically engaged. 
The United States is the nation that it is 
today because of immigrant contributions. In 
fact, I am proud to represent one of the most 
diverse congressional districts in the country, 
in Queens, New York; it is a place where im-
migrant communities have thrived for decades 
and decades. 
Madam Speaker, I am a proud daughter of 
immigrants. I know firsthand the difficulties my 
parents and grandparents encountered when 
they immigrated to the United States for a bet-
ter life for their children. This is not an uncom-
mon story. While the levels of hardships of 
new immigrants vary, there are common chal-
lenges—from language barriers to finding 
work. 
That is why, I am so proud to reintroduce 
the ‘‘New Deal for New Americans Act’’. I am 
honored and grateful to lead this bill with Sen-
ators MARKEY and HIRONO and Representa-
tives JAYAPAL and GARCI´A. The New Deal for 
New Americans Act would ensure a more in-
clusive and welcoming immigration system to 
help new Americans achieve their American 
Dream. Among many provisions, this bill 
would help immigrants overcome common 
challenges such as language barriers and em-
ployment attainment, and help start a business 
and break down barriers to naturalization. 
Specifically, the ‘‘New Deal for New Ameri-
cans Act’’ would: 
Establish a National Office of New Ameri-
cans in the Executive Office of the White 
House to promote and support immigrant and 
refugee integration and inclusion and coordi-
nate efforts of federal, state, and local govern-
ments to support social, economic, and civic 
integration of immigrants and refugees. 
Establish a Federal Initiative on New Ameri-
cans to coordinate federal response to ad-
dress issues that affect the lives of new immi-
grants and refugees and communities with 
growing immigrant and refugee populations. 
Create a Legal Services and Immigration 
Assistance Grant Program to support organi-
zations that provide direct immigration assist-
ance to those in need of immigration screen-
ing; know-your-rights education; assistance in 
applying for citizenship, lawful permanent resi-
dent status or other legal status (DACA, TPS, 
asylum, etc.); or seeking relief from a removal 
order. 
Create an English as a Gateway to Integra-
tion Program for organizations that teach 
English or help individuals prepare for natu-
ralization or earn a GED. 
Create a Workforce Development Grant 
Program to ensure that immigrant and refugee 
adults have equitable access to education and 
workforce programs that help equip them with 
occupational skills needed to secure or ad-
vance in employment. 
Reduce barriers for individuals to naturalize 
by establishing a flat application fee for natu-
ralization, amending the English and civics 
exam requirements for older individuals, and 
exempting eligible U.S. high school graduates 
from taking the naturalization exams. 
Limit USCIS’s ability to raise fees without 
Congress’ approval, plus require authorization 
of appropriations to cover USCIS’ need to op-
erate and adjudicate cases. 
Promote civic engagement through auto-
matic voter registration of newly naturalized in-
dividuals. 
Expand family integration by reducing the 
age of citizens who are able to petition eligible 
family members from 21 years old to 18 years 
old.

IN RECOGNITION OF MIKE 
TEDESCO 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Mike Tedesco on his 
new role as President and CEO of Vision To-
gether 2025 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 
Vision Together 2025 is a volunteer-based

Greater Johnstown region by laying a ground-
work for better educational and economic op-
portunities. Vision Together 2025 already is 
making great strides in its mission, and I am

Mike holds a degree from the University of 
Idaho and a master’s degree in Urban & Re-

An expert in urban planning, Mike was most

HONORING THE LIFE OF W. 
EUGENE BURRELL 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a community leader and 
friend, W. Eugene Burrell of Fannett, Texas, 
who passed away on Wednesday, December 
30, 2020, at the age of 86. Eugene was a life-
long cattle rancher, rice farmer, and civic lead-
er in Southeast Texas. He had the respect of 
all who knew him. 
Eugene was born on October 27, 1934, in 
Beaumont, Texas, to Louise DeVillier Burrell 
and Walter Jordan Burrell. He began farming 
rice at the age of 18 and worked in that role 
until the age of 21, when he decided to serve 
his country in the United States Army. After 
serving in the Army from 1955 to 1957, where 
he was stationed overseas in Germany, Eu-
gene returned home and continued rice farm-
ing—an occupation that would unknowingly 
last for 52 years. Apart from growing rice, he 
was also a dedicated cattle rancher for more 
than 70 years. Eugene served as a board 
member on numerous industry and community 
boards, such as: the American Rice Incor-
porate Board in Houston, the American Rice 
Growers Board in Cheek, Texas, the Coastal 
Cattlemen’s Association Board, the Equali-
zation Board for the Jefferson County Ap-
praisal District, the West Jefferson Municipal 
Water District, and the Texas Rice Festival, 
where he volunteered with his wife, Sandra. In 
1999, Eugene was named the Texas Rice 
Festival Farmer of the Year and subsequently 
its Pioneer Farmer of the Year in 2017. His 
steadfast faith was always important to him. In 
fact, he served as a member of St. Mary’s 
Fannett Knights of Columbus organization. 
In addition to ‘‘Eugene,’’ his friends and 
family lovingly referred to him as ‘‘Dad,’’ 
‘‘Pawpaw,’’ ‘‘Boogie,’’ and ‘‘Fred’’. Supporting 
his children, and later his grandchildren, by at-
tending their sporting events and various com-
petitions over the years was always a top pri-
ority to him. Eugene is survived by his wife of 
63 years, Sandra Ray Burrell; daughters, 
Karen Burrell Reneau and her husband, Char-
lie, and Kelly Burrell Alton and her husband, 
Randy; son, Troy Eugene Burrell and his wife, 
Shelly; grandchildren, Landon Reneau and his 
wife, Hillary, William Reneau and his wife, 
Amanda, Lane Stuart, Reid Alton, Mary Alton, 
Abby Alton, Cody Burrell, and Cameron Burrell 
and his wife, Lauren; great-grandchildren, Eli 
Reneau, Ella Reneau, and Bryar Burrell and 
numerous nieces and nephews. He is pre-
ceded in death by his parents, Louise and 
Walter Burrell, and brother, James ‘‘Jack’’ 
Burrell. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor my 
friend W. Eugene Burrell for his many years of 
faithful service to his community. My thoughts 
and prayers remain with his family and friends 
during this difficult time.

HONORING 
THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
AND SERVICE OF CAPT. (RET) 
JAMES MICHAEL KUZMA 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I 
rise to pay tribute to a great man and my long-
time friend, Capt. (Ret) James Michael 
Kuzma. Jim passed away unexpectedly on Fri-
day, February 5, 2021, just three days shy of 
his 60th birthday. 
Jim was born February 8, 1961 in Steuben-
ville, Ohio. He earned a Bachelor of Science 
degree in Mechanical Engineering from the 
U.S. Naval Academy, a Master of Science in 
Engineering Management from the Catholic 
University of America, and a Master of 
Science in National Resource Strategy from 
the Industrial College of the Armed Forces 
(ICAF). 
Jim served 28 years with the U.S. Navy be-
fore ‘‘retiring’’ to Cocoa Beach in 2011. I say 
‘‘retiring’’ in quotations because anyone who 
knew Jim knew that it was nearly unthinkable 
for him to rest. He was always thinking of cre-
ative ways to solve challenges. For the last 
decade, Jim served as Space Florida’s Senior 
Vice President and General Manager of the 
Cape Canaveral Spaceport, working to cement 
the state’s position as a world leader in aero-
space. 
Recruited to Space Florida to strengthen 
and grow its operational support for the com-
mercial space industry at Cape Canaveral 
Spaceport, Jim embraced the mission and ex-
celled at finding ways to respond to industry’s 
needs. He led efforts to secure Federal Avia-
tion Administration spaceport operating li-
censes for both the former Shuttle Landing 
Facility (SLF) and other former Government 
sites on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. 
Jim spearheaded the transfer of the SLF to 
Space Florida’s management and operation, 
and he was instrumental in attracting Blue Ori-
gin to base its orbital program in Florida. For 
the past two years, he worked tirelessly to en-
sure a solution for replacing NASA’s 1964 In-
dian River Bridge that would meet the space-
port’s needs far into the future. These were 
only a few examples Jim’s accomplishments 
to further America’s space program in positive 
ways. 
Jim visited my office frequently in Wash-
ington, advocating for the commercial space 
industry, offering creative solutions to prob-
lems, and urging needed regulatory reform to 
ensure America’s leadership in space. He 
served on the Board of the Commercial 
Spaceflight Federation, and more recently on 
the CSF Executive Committee. 
Jim began his Naval service on the USS 
Jacksonville SSN 699. He went on to Naval 
Sea Systems Command, serving during 1988 
through 90 as a Fleet Liaison and Systems 
Test Director for various submarine Combat 
and Weapons System Program Offices. He 
served as Engineering Officer on the USS 
Newport News SSN 750 from 1991 to 1994. In 
1994, he was assigned to the Commander in 
Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) Nu-
clear Propulsion Examining Board. He served 
as the Executive Officer on USS Atlanta SSN 
712 from October 1996 to July 1998 before re-
porting to Submarine Warfare Division of the 
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations 
(OPNAV) staffer where he served as Sub-
marine Combat Systems Requirements Offi-
cer. Following that, he served as the Com-
manding Officer of the USS Boise 764 from 
March 2001 until October 2003. He then be-
came Deputy Director for Operations on the 
staff of the Commander, Naval Submarine 
Forces from 2003 to 2005. From October 
2005 to August 2007, Captain Kuzma served 
as Special Activities Division Chief on Stra-
tegic Command’s Joint Functional Component 
Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and 
Reconnaissance staff before attending the In-
dustrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) 
from August 2007 to June 2008. He rounded 
off his impressive Naval career as the Com-
manding Officer of the Naval Ordnance Test 
Unit in Cape Canaveral (2008–2011). 
Captain Kuzma’s personal decorations in-
clude the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, De-
fense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meri-
torious Service Medals, six Navy and Marine 
Corps Commendation Medals and four Navy 
and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. Yet, 
he never spoke about them. Jim was indeed

passionate about his work, but his greatest joy 
in life was his family. Anyone who spent time 
around Jim instantly knew that he was a fam-
ily man; he delighted in attending concerts and 
visiting theme parks with his family, especially 
his grandchildren. He is survived by Karen, his 
wife of 36 years, their four children, James Mi-
chael II (Andrea Pinzon-Garcia), William Jor-
dan (Patricia Kuzma), Lauren Rose (Aaron 
Possinger) and Candace Marie and five 
grandchildren, Ariana, Lillian, Camilo, Ade-
laide, and Maverick. He is also survived by his 
mother, Catherine Kuzma, and mother-in-law, 
Candace Jordan. He is also survived by innu-
merable friends and colleagues, who all miss 
him dearly. 
On a personal note, I am proud to have 
called Jim my friend for many years. Jim 
served on my selection board for the U.S. 
Naval Academy. He believed in the impor-
tance of serving our nation and was a strong 
supporter of our brave men and women in 
military uniform as well as our military vet-
erans. Jim was proud of our nation’s space 
program, worked tirelessly to promote Amer-
ica’s mission in Space along with our commer-
cial space endeavors, and was champion for 
local businesses in Brevard County, Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in saluting Captain James Kuzma for a 
lifetime of service to the United States and his 
fellow citizens. I would also like to ask my col-
leagues in the House to join us in extending 
our deepest sympathies to Jim’s family, 
friends, colleagues, and loved ones during this 
difficult time.

RECOGNIZING DR. WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ 
GOLDSTEIN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Dr. William ‘‘Bill’’ Goldstein on the 
occasion of his upcoming retirement as Direc-
tor of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
(LLNL) and President of Lawrence Livermore 
National Security, LLC on March 1, 2021. 
Before landing at LLNL, Bill received a 
bachelor’s degree in physics from Swarthmore 
College in Pennsylvania, a doctorate in theo-
retical physics from Columbia University in 
New York, and was a postdoctoral research 
associate with the Theoretical Physics Group 
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. His 
first assignment at LLNL was in the Physics 
Directorate, where his portfolio included di-
verse national security and science programs. 
This positioned him well to take on super-
visory and senior management roles, such as 
Associate Director of Physical and Life 
Sciences, then Deputy Director for Science 
and Technology, where he was tasked with 
leading the strategic deployment of LLNL’s 
science and technology capabilities. He con-
tinued to impress and was named LLNL’s 12th 
director and LLNS’ 3rd president on March 31, 
2014. 
Under Bill’s leadership during the past 
seven years, LLNL’s budget and workforce 
have grown by 50 percent and 25 percent re-
spectively. In fact, in 2020, LLNL was listed in 
the top ten of GlassDoor’s 100 best large 
places to work in the United States. All of this 
occurred despite ever-increasing competition 
for talent from nearby Silicon Valley. 
LLNL has experienced significant growth in 
all programs and operations with Bill at the 
helm. He has prepared it and its personnel to 
lead a new era of nuclear stockpile steward-
ship, ensuring that our nuclear weapons are 
responsibly 
maintained 
and 
keeping 
the 
United States at the forefront of innovation. 
Much of this is made possible by Sierra, a 
new class of supercomputer brought into the 
field in the last few years. Bill’s holistic and 
multi-jurisdictional thinking continues to enable 
growth and flexibility throughout LLNL oper-
ations and our national security. 
Most recently, Bill not only helped his LLNL 
team navigate the new workforce realities 
brought about by the COVID–19 pandemic, 
but he and his management team also did 
their part to make significant contributions to 
the fight against the disease, fabricating emer-
gency ventilators, using 3D printing to fab-
ricate nasal swabs, and providing predicted 
structures of a key COVID–19 viral protein to 
help accelerate the development of potential 
medical treatments for the disease. 
As if all that was not enough, Bill has au-
thored or co-authored more than 70 papers on 
a variety of topics while a fellow of the Amer-
ican Physical Society and the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science. 
I thank Bill for his nearly four decades of 
service. Enjoy a well-earned retirement, and 
we wish him all the best while he spends 
more time with his wife, Kathy, and twin 
daughters, Emma and Sarah.

IN RECOGNITION OF LESLIE 
KELLY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 24, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Leslie Kelly of Altoona, 
Pennsylvania for her work as founder of Serv-
ice Paws of Central Pennsylvania. 
Leslie Kelly understands firsthand the bar-
riers that family can face when purchasing a 
service dog, which can cost between $4,000 
and $35,000. To help families with this costly 
process, Leslie founded Service Paws of Cen-
tral Pennsylvania. Last year, her organization 
was able to assist several people in need of 
a service dog. 
Service Paws of Central Pennsylvania now 
serves 14 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. As 
an all-volunteer organization, Service Paws of 
Central Pennsylvania is able to use its re-
sources to directly place service dogs with in-
dividuals and families in need. 
Leslie is an incredible and servant-hearted 
leader in Blair County and across our Com-
monwealth. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th 
Congressional District, I thank Leslie Kelly for 
her work to improve the lives of Pennsylva-
nians and wish her continued success in this 
mission.
