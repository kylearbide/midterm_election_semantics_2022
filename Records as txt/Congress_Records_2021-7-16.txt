PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our Creator, Your hands made 
us and formed us. Please now, give us 
also wisdom and understanding in the 
living of these days that we would have 
hearts and minds which are eager for 
Your direction and ready for Your 
guidance. 
Use us in such a way that those 
around us would see the hope You have 
given us. Through our words, our ac-
tions, our faithfulness to Your compas-
sionate counsel, may we reveal Your 
tender mercies in our own dialogue and 
decisions. 
According to the character and de-
cency of Your being we are judged, but 
in Your mercy and goodness, we are 
loved. 
Speak through us in such a way that 
even those who criticize us unfairly, 
even the most unjust of our adver-
saries, would be convicted of their own 
hubris and shameful behavior, but 
through our compassion, come to re-
joice in their acquittal by the extraor-
dinary gift of Your grace. 
May we choose to walk blameless in 
Your presence. May our hearts remain 
undivided from Your perfect righteous-
ness. 
In Your redeeming name we pray. 
Amen.

DAVID E. SKAGGS, 
FORMER MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

DEAR
MADAM
SPEAKER: It has been an 
honor and privilege to serve as Chair (and, 
during Republican majorities, Co-Chair) of 
the board of the Office of Congressional Eth-
ics since your appointment in 2008. 
I believe I have served long enough and 
should relinquish that position and make 
way for a new member of the board. I write 
to resign as OCE board chair and member, ef-
fective at the end of the meeting of the OCE 
board on July 16, 2021. I understand that you 
intend to appoint former Congressman Mike 
Barnes to be chair and to assume that posi-
tion at the time my resignation is effective. 
The work the board and staff have done to 
carry out the mission of OCE over almost 13 
years have confirmed your original vision 
and, I believe, have brought credit to the 
House of Representatives. I love the House 
and its central place in our cherished demo-
cratic Republic. I am so grateful for the op-
portunity you have given me to serve the 
House and the country for these 13 years and 
to work to help the House uphold its core 
ethical values. Thank you. 
With my deep respect, I remain, 
Sincerely yours, 
DAVID E. SKAGGS, 
Former Member of Congress, Board Chair, 
Office of Congressional Ethics.

HAZEL ERBY 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that Saint Louis and I rise to com-
memorate the life of councilwoman Hazel 
Erby. 
There are no words that can truly encap-
sulate what Hazel Erby meant to the St. Louis 
region. She was a true personification of a 
public servant. She served with grace, class, 
integrity, and most importantly from a deep 
place in her heart—a place that was filled with 
love for her community. That love was always 
evidenced by the vigor, passion, and unrelent-
ing disposition she would approach her work 
with. She was a community icon and a legisla-
tive trailblazer, unafraid of going where others 
would not venture to go and speaking when 
many stayed silent. During my run for office, 
she maintained her love and support of me 
and she was a bedrock of encouragement 
when I needed it most. I faced so many obsta-
cles throughout my political journey and her 
unyielding support and encouragement to both 
me and my staff will be etched in my heart for-
ever. Hazel Erby was driven by doing what’s 
right for all people, starting with those among 
us who have the least because she clearly un-
derstood that’s what matters. 
‘‘Mama Hazel’’ ’s legacy will be felt for years 
to come as it is in the work she accomplished 
and all of the lives she touched. She was 
deeply committed to equity in government 
funding and was instrumental in establishing 
legislation that outlined standards and require-
ments for minority participation in government 
contracts. She also played a key role in secur-
ing funds for a recreation center in St. Louis 
County. Hazel Erby had a vision for St. Louis 
County, and she worked tirelessly on and off 
platforms and stages to see that vision be-
come a reality. 
We are deeply saddened by the loss of this 
community giant, and I, like the rest of my 
community, am mourning her death. That said, 
I take great comfort and joy in the fact that 
she is left this world with an empty cup be-
cause she’s poured so much of herself out for 
the betterment of our world. I’d say there is no 
better way to live. We are no doubt indebted 
to her for the service she’s paid to our com-
munity. 
I thank Hazel Erby.

HONORING LIEUTENANT GENERAL 
FRANCIS M. BEAUDETTE FOR 32 
YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Lieutenant General Francis M. 
Beaudette for 32 years of distinguished mili-
tary service. 
Lt. Gen. Beaudette has made immeasurable 
contributions to our great Nation and con-
tinues to personify the core U.S. Army values 
of honor, integrity, personal courage, and self-
less service. He began his career in 1989 as 
a military intelligence officer and retires as the 
Commanding General of the U.S. Army Spe-
cial Operations Command at Fort Bragg. 
After graduating from The Citadel, Lt. Gen. 
Beaudette went on to serve as a battalion as-
sistant, crewmember, and armor platoon lead-
er in Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. He 
completed Special Forces training in 1995 and 
was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group 
before serving as the aide-de-camp to the 
commanding general of the U.S. Army John F. 
Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School 
and the aide-de-camp to the deputy com-
manding general of Kosovo Forces. 
Over the course of his extraordinary career, 
Lt. Gen. Beaudette has answered the call to 
duty many times. He previously served as the 
Deputy Commanding General of the 1st Ar-
mored Division, Assistant Commander of the 
Joint Special Operations Command, and Com-
manding General of the 1st Special Forces 
Command. Lt. Gen. Beaudette retires as a 
decorated military leader and true American 
hero, having earned some of the most pres-
tigious awards bestowed by our military. He 
represents the best our Nation has to offer, 
and his legacy of leadership will be felt for 
generations. 
As Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I know I 
speak for our Nation and our community when 
I say we are truly grateful for Lt. Gen. 
Beaudette’s extraordinary service and cannot 
thank him enough. I have personally benefited 
from his friendship and counsel and would like 
to offer my sincerest appreciation and wish 
him success in his future endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring 
Lieutenant 
General 
Francis 
M. 
Beaudette for 32 years of military service.

CELEBRATING 
RETIRED 
NAVY 
CAPTAIN 
GILES 
M. 
KELLY’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor retired Navy Captain Giles M. Kelly, a 
member of the Greatest Generation. Today, 
July 17, 2021, Captain Kelly, celebrates his 
100th birthday, and I commemorate his excep-
tional and dedicated service to our nation. 
Captain Kelly, the son of an electrical engi-
neer and an educator, was born in Bronxville, 
New York. He graduated from New York State 
Merchant Marine Academy in 1942 and re-
ported for duty as a Navy Reserve in the Pa-
cific during the Second World War. He contin-
ued his studies at Williams College, and in 
1951, he completed a master’s degree in pub-
lic affairs at Princeton University. He was re-
called to active duty during the Vietnam War, 
acting as chief of public affairs at the North 
American Treaty Organization (NATO)’s Atlan-
tic Command in Norfolk, Virginia. 
Captain Kelly also worked for Central Intel-
ligence Agency and the State Department as 
a foreign service officer in Europe and Africa. 
He commanded the former presidential yacht 
Sequoia from 1983 to 1988 and wrote a book 
about the historic ship. Further, Captain Kelly 
was an adjunct professor of seamanship and 
sailing at American University, worked at the 
Smithsonian Institution, and was the owner 
and director of the Gangplank Sailing School. 
On this, his 100th birthday, Captain Kelly 
has our appreciation for his long and faithful 
service and the best wishes of Congress in 
celebrating this momentous occasion.

IN MEMORY OF SENATOR TOM 
BUFORD 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
honor a special Kentuckian, Senator Tom 
Buford, from Nicholasville, Kentucky. 
Tom Buford was a lifelong Kentuckian. He 
was born in 1949 and graduated from Jessa-
mine County High School and the University 
of Kentucky. Senator Buford received further 
education from the American Institute of Bank-
ing. He was elected to the Kentucky State 
Senate in 1991. He represented the people of 
Senate District 22 until his passing on July 6, 
2021. 
In 
Kentucky’s 
Senate, 
Senator 
Buford 
served as Minority Whip from 1991–92 and 
Minority Caucus Chair from 1993–96. At the 
time of his death he held seats on the Licens-
ing and Occupations, Appropriations and Rev-
enue, and Banking and Insurance committees. 
In his more than thirty years in the Senate, he 
sponsored many important pieces of legisla-
tion. Senator Buford had a particular interest 
in support for the disabled and for animal wel-
fare. 
Senator Buford was highly regarded by his 
colleagues in the Kentucky Senate and by all 
who knew him. He was a great storyteller and 
he knew the value of humor. After serving for 
thirty years, he acquired great institutional 
knowledge of the Senate. He was known as a 
kind and humble man, a true servant leader. 
He leaves behind his wife Carol, children 
Stephanie and Beau, and his precious grand-
children. Senator Buford will be greatly 
missed. 
It is my humble honor to lift up the memory 
of a great Kentucky gentleman and a dedi-
cated leader, Senator Tom Buford, before the 
United States Congress.

HONORING 
BRAD 
AND 
CAROL 
WHITMORE AS IOWANS OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Brad and Carol Whitmore, two remark-
able veterans, as Iowans of the Week. Over 
the Fourth of July weekend, I couldn’t think of 
better honorees than two individuals who not 
only served our country for many years but 
have since continued their service to the coun-
try by doing incredible work to support and ad-
vocate for fellow veterans. 
Carol Whitmore served in the U.S. Army, 
and has been honored with over 20 medals, 
ribbons, and badges from her 36 years of 
service. Following her service, Carol earned a 
Gold Legacy Life membership with the VFW 
Post 9127 in Des Moines. She has served in 
many leadership roles, ranging from the Post, 
District, and Department levels to the National 
stage. Carol is a member of the Governor’s 
Veterans Council and sits on the National 
Council as a representative for the Iowa VFW. 
As a legislative advocate on both local and 
national levels, she continues to fight for vet-
eran’s rights. 
Carol is particularly passionate about wom-
en’s issues and helping homeless veterans at 
the Des Moines Homeless Shelter. When 
asked what she is especially proud of, Carol 
mentioned becoming a State Commander for 
the VFW and working with homeless veterans 
in the state. 
Brad Whitmore, a native of Des Moines, en-
listed in the U.S. Army in 1970 and volun-
teered to go to Vietnam a year later. He then 
served one tour and volunteered again for a 
second tour, then received an Honorable Dis-
charge from the Army in 1976. Brad reenlisted 
in the Army Reserve in 1988 and found em-
ployment in the civilian world as a surgical 
tech, later earning an associate degree from 
Des Moines Area Community College for 
Nursing in 1994. The same year, Brad 
changed his civilian job to become a surgical 
nurse and was promoted to Second Lieuten-
ant in the Army. In 1999, he and Carol mar-
ried, and Brad retired in 2005 after 26 years 
of service. 
After his retirement, Brad was elected Quar-
ter Master of his VFW post in Beaverdale in 
2012 and was elected four years later as 
Quarter Master of Iowa’s 5th District. Brad be-
came Chairman of Iowa’s National Legislative 
Committee, and he continues to do legislative 
work raising awareness about veteran’s issues 
on the national level. His current project is 
working on the Richard Starr Act, which aims 
to protect medically discharged veterans. Brad 
said he is most proud of supporting his wife 
and admires all that she does to improve the 
lives of veterans. 
I want to thank the Whitmores not only for 
the years they served in the Army, but for all 
the work they continue to do, and for the time 
they have dedicated to helping veterans. I am 
inspired by Brad and Carol’s stories, and I am 
committed to supporting our nation’s veterans, 
just as they both are. It is my pleasure to rec-
ognize Brad and Carol Whitmore as Iowans of 
the Week. 
OCCASION OF CENTENNIAL OF THE 
HAWAIIAN 
HOMES 
COMMISSION 
ACT 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, last Friday, my 
colleague, Congressman KAIALI‘I KAHELE (Ha-
waii—Second), and I gathered here on Capitol 
Hill with leaders of our Native Hawaiian com-
munity and partners in the advancement of 
Native Hawaiians everywhere to recognize the 
centennial of the enactment, on July 9, 1921, 
of a truly revolutionary law, the Hawaiian 
Homes Commission Act, to honor the times 
and memory of its author, Hawaii Delegate to 
Congress Prince Jonah Ku¯hio¯ Kalani‘anaole, 
and to reflect on and commit to the path still 
ahead. 
That afternoon, we came together on the 
East grounds of the Capitol, directly outside 
the House chamber where Ku¯hio¯ served for 
almost two decades, to share our mana’o 
(thoughts) on this momentous day. I would like 
to share here my own remarks on behalf of all 
throughout our Hawaii who I am privileged to 
represent: 
To my colleague and friend, Congressman 
Kahele, our incredible guests that are here 
with us today, and our friends and ‘ohana 
watching everywhere, Aloha. 
As I stand with you today, I have so many 
conflicting thoughts and emotions. 
We are here on hallowed grounds that for 
centuries now have stood for the very best of 
humanity, and yet we are also on ground 
that at a bare minimum tolerated the over-
throw of the Hawaiian Kingdom. 
We are on grounds that have advanced 
equality, opportunity, compassion and jus-
tice, and yet have sanctioned so much trial 
and tragedy for our indigenous peoples. 
We are on grounds where just one year ago, 
we gathered to bid aloha to one of the great 
icons of the civil rights movement, my col-
league John Lewis, and yet it is this very 
ground from which was launched an attack 
on our Capitol and democracy by our own 
fellow citizens. 
This land is riddled with contradictions. As 
it was when Prince Ku¯ hio¯ came to Congress 
as the first Native Hawaiian to serve almost 
120 years ago. 
Ku¯ hio¯ spoke then of the urgency and de-
spair of a people facing extinction in their 
own land. That was no idle concern. It had in 
fact happened to other indigenous peoples 
throughout our country and world; their peo-
ples and cultures are simply no more. 
There were then just perhaps 40,000 Native 
Hawaiians. The life expectancy of Native Ha-
waiians was but thirty years. They were in-
creasingly not living on the land as had doz-
ens of generations before them, but in the 
tenements 
of 
Honolulu 
in 
dire 
cir-
cumstances. 
And yet, Ku¯ hio¯ entrusted his people to this 
still-new country, a country of promise but 
that had not shown it was deserving of that 
trust. And he devoted his next two decades 
toward advancing his people and to prove 
that his trust had not been misplaced. 
As Congressman Kahele has said, the Ha-
waiian Homes Commission Act, signed one 
hundred years ago today, was his singular 
accomplishment. 
But 
what 
was 
Prince 
Ku¯ hio¯’s legacy? What did it all add up to? 
History is fickle. We’re all judged by our 
successes and failures, our achievements and 
our shortcomings (of course always in hind-
sight and without the context of the times). 
But I would make these three observations 
about Ku¯ hio¯, looking back from the distance 
of history and as someone who is not Native 
Hawaiian. 
First, he was exactly the right person for 
his time and place. Not just for Native Ha-
waiians, but for all of us whose ancestors and 
lifeblood lay then and now in Hawaii. 
Second, the Kanaka Maoli did not, unlike 
many of their brothers and sisters, fade from 
this Earth. Native Hawaiians now number in 
the hundreds of thousands throughout our 
country and world, proudly reclaiming and 
perpetuating their history and culture and 
contributing alongside all others who seek a 
better path forward. 
Third, Ku¯ hio¯, as the first Native Hawaiian 
leader to step forward onto the national 
stage, exemplified what proud, principled 
and capable Hawaiian leadership is, setting 
the standard for so many of us who followed 
down the road he paved. 
But history is never complete, and the Ha-
waiian Homes Commission Act is a perfect 
example. As one Kanaka Maoli leader noted 
recently, the Hawaiian Homes Commission 
Act was beautifully conceived but did not de-
liver in its implementation. In that the Act 
is its own story, and now we must turn the 
page toward better chapters. 
Today, I follow and support Congressman 
Kahele in finding and forging that next chap-
ter. For yesterday’s achievements are just 
tomorrow’s 
foundations, 
and 
yesterday’s 
failures are just tomorrow’s opportunities. 
I am so deeply humbled with the responsi-
bility—for all of us wherever we are for 
whom Hawaii is and always will be our true 
home—to partner with you in these next 
chapters of renewed opportunity and hope. 
Thank you. Mahalo.

SERGEANT 
La 
DAVID T. JOHNSON ON THE OC-
CASION OF HIS INDUCTION AS 
AN HONORARY GREEN BERET 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Sergeant La 
David T. Johnson on the occasion of his in-
duction as an honorary member of the United 
States Army Special Forces, or ‘‘Green Be-
rets.’’ 
SGT Johnson is an American hero who laid 
down his life in the line of duty and to save 
the lives of his teammates on Wednesday, 
October 4, 2017 in southwest Niger. Assigned 
to the 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, 
he personified the values of honor, integrity, 
personal courage, and selfless service. 
SGT Johnson enlisted in the United States 
Army in January 2014 and after completing 
Advanced Individual Training and earning the 
Military Occupational Specialty 91B Wheeled 
Vehicle Mechanic, he was assigned to the 2nd

A role model among his peers in the 3rd

RECOGNIZING 
CMSGT 
BRIAN 
MARQUARDT ON THE OCCASION 
OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
AIR 
FORCE 
AFTER 33 YEARS OF HONORABLE 
SERVICE 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize 
Chief 
Master 
Sergeant 
Brian 
Marquardt of Harrison Township on the occa-
sion of his retirement from the United States 
Air Force after 33 years of honorable service. 
After growing up in Saint Clair Shores, 
CMSgt Marquardt entered the Air Force in 
July 1988. After completing basic military train-
ing at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, he 
was assigned to the 88th Medical Group at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for 
on-the-job training as an Aerospace Medical 
Technician. His subsequent career includes 
various aspects of the medical technician field 
and 
included 
Aeromedical 
Evacuation, 
Aeromedical Staging and Transportation, and 
most recently, a ground medical unit with a 
physical exam package and a shared Air 
Force Theater Hospital. 
His last position was as the Senior Enlisted 
Advisor for the 910th Medical Squadron at 
Youngstown Air Reserve Station in Ohio. In 
this role he advised the commander on mat-
ters concerning the health, morale, welfare, 
and the effective utilization of the Reserve 
members within the squadron. He also served 
as the commander’s representative to numer-
ous committees, councils, boards, and military 
and civilian functions. Prior to assuming this 
most recent position, he served as the Func-
tional Manager for the Aerospace Medical 
Technician career field at Selfridge Air Na-
tional Guard Base, as well as Youngstown Air 
Reserve Station. 
CMSgt Marquardt has received numerous 
awards and decorations including Meritorious 
Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Aerial 
Achievement Medal, Air Force Commendation 
Medal with oak leaf cluster, Meritorious Unit 
Award with 2 oak leaf cluster, AF Outstanding 
Unit Award with Valor Device and 2 oak leaf 
clusters, Iraqi Campaign Medal with one serv-
ice star and the Humanitarian Service Medal. 
CMSgt Marquardt has given over three dec-
ades of his life in service to our country. I 
commend him for this selfless display of love 
and patriotism. He has certainly made his 
home state of Michigan proud, and I know the 
example of service he has set will be followed 
for years to come. I wish CMSgt Marquardt 
the best as he takes on life’s next great ad-
venture. We are so thankful for his service. 
TRIBUTE TO DENA BARON 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dena Baron, a long-time 
member of the professional staff of the House 
Appropriations Committee, who is retiring after 
more than 25 years of service in the Federal 
Government. 
Dena began her career at the Environ-
mental Protection Agency in 1995. While a 
budget analyst at the Environmental Protection 
Agency, she was detailed to the House Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs 
and Housing and Urban Development. 
Following her detail, in 1999, Dena became 
professional staff for the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs and Hous-
ing and Urban Development. In 2004, she 
moved to the House Appropriations Sub-
committee on Transportation and Treasury 
until the House Appropriations Committee re-
organized in the 109th Congress. Following 
the reorganization, Dena became Clerk for the 
House 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee 
on 
Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban 
Development, the Judiciary, and the District of 
Columbia. 
When 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
switched control in 2007, and the House Ap-
propriations Committee underwent another re-
organization setting the subcommittees to their 
current form, Dena became Minority Clerk for 
the Transportation, Housing and Urban Devel-
opment Subcommittee. Continuing her trend of 
versatility, Dena simultaneously worked on the 
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Fi-
nancial Services and General Government 
subcommittees. 
When the Republicans took control of the 
House of Representatives in the 112th Con-
gress, Dena became Clerk for the House Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Transportation, 
Housing and Urban Development, and then in 
2017, she became Clerk for the House Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Financial Services 
and General Government. 
When 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
switched control in 2019, as only fitting, Dena 
ventured into uncharted territory and became 
Minority Clerk for the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security. This op-
portunity presented a range of new chal-
lenges, and she, once again, demonstrated 
her ability to handle any task put before her 
and performed remarkably. 
Dena was an exceptional member of the 
Appropriations Committee staff for more than 
twenty years, and she served on my staff for 
three of those years. I asked Dena to work on 
some of the most divisive issues of the day, 
and she saw us through one of the longest 
government shutdowns in history two years 
ago by finding common ground with her col-
leagues. 
Dena has spent many hours away from her 
loved ones over the course of her long Fed-
eral career, and I know she is looking forward 
to spending more time with her husband, Jim 
Smith, her son, Andrew, and her daughter, 
Emily. Dena will be greatly missed, and I wish 
her the best in her next chapter and thank her 
for her dedicated service to the United States.

for his service to the United States of America 
over the course of his 33-year career with the 
U.S. Army and his two years in command of 
Fort Drum in Northern New York, which I 
proudly represent. 
Major General Mennes graduated from the 
United States Military Academy in West Point, 
New York in 1988 and immediately commis-
sioned into the U.S. Army as an Infantry offi-
cer. Since then, MG Mennes has deployed 
three times in support of Operation Iraqi Free-
dom and five times in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom. In addition to leading the 
famed 10th Mountain Division, MG Mennes 
has also served in the storied 82nd Airborne 
Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A high-
ly decorated officer, MG Mennes is known for 
his exceptional leadership skills, commitment 
to his soldiers and families, and ability to cul-
tivate a supportive community. MG Mennes 
easily fit into the culture of the North Country 
and leaves Fort Drum after changing it for the 
better. 
During his tenure at Fort Drum, Major Gen-
eral Mennes was influential in ensuring his 
soldiers were combat-ready while building a 
strong support system within the community. 
He led the 10th Mountain Division through an 
Afghanistan deployment and drawdown as the 
U.S. prepares to bring our troops home after 
nearly twenty years in the country. In addition, 
MG Mennes has faced unprecedented chal-
lenges in commanding Fort Drum through the 
Coronavirus pandemic where he was respon-
sible for the lives, health, and safety of thou-
sands of soldiers, families, and civilians. 
On behalf of New York’s 2lst district and the 
entire Fort Drum community, I would like to 
thank Major General Mennes for his excep-
tional leadership and continued investment in 
his community. I congratulate him on his 
achievements thus far and wish him the best 
of luck during his next assignment at Joint 
Base Lewis—McChord, Washington.

HONORING 
VIRGINIA

UNIVERSITY 
SOFTBALL’S 
NA-
TIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Virginia Wesleyan University 
Softball Marlins upon winning the 2021 NCAA 
Division III Championship. This was no easy 
task, and it took extraordinary skill, character, 
and determination to complete this difficult 
achievement. 
This national championship victory is the 
Marlin’s third title in the last four complete 
seasons, having also won in 2017 and 2018. 
After having their 2020 season cut short due 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, Virginia Wes-
leyan returned to the field in 2021 in dominant 
fashion, winning 46 games while only losing 
six times and tying once. After seeing the 
championship series against Texas Lutheran 
University tied after two games, the Marlins 
displayed their might, winning the final game 
with a score of nine runs to one. 
It is truly an honor to have such outstanding 
champions represent our community. I con-
gratulate all the members of the Virginia Wes-
leyan Softball Marlins on this tremendous ac-
complishment, and I wish the program the 
best of luck in the seasons to come.

OF 
MR. 
JOHN 
LYNSKEY’S SERVICE TO CHRIS-
TOPHER 
COLUMBUS 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding career of one Mr. 
John Lynskey for his service in: educating, 
coaching and mentoring the young men at 
Christopher Columbus High School for the last 
37 years. 
Mr. John Lynskey has dedicated the last 37 
years of his life to educating and teaching the 
students 
of 
Christopher 
Columbus 
High 
School what it takes to become a responsible 
man. What began as a teaching/coaching ca-
reer in 1984, evolved into a prestigious reputa-
tion as one of the schools finest and most re-
spected mentors to thousands of Explorers 
who have walked the halls of Christopher Co-
lumbus. Mr. Lynskey is one of the few Explor-
ers inducted into both the School’s main hall 
of fame and Athletic Hall of Fame; he joins the 
ranks with several professional athletes includ-
ing: former NFL Quarterback Brian Griese, 
MLB outfielder Jon Jay, and Olympic athlete 
Eddie Alvarez (just to name a few). 
Although the entire Christopher Columbus 
community alumni and students will miss Mr. 
Lynskey, he is leaving behind an unshakeable 
legacy. From teaching Social Studies for over 
thirty years and more recently as the Dean of 
Students, to having his own Podcast (Looking 
Back with Lynskey) John Lynskey will be re-
membered as more than just an educator and 
administrator but as truly a Renaissance man 
in the realm of education in the South Florida 
Community. 
John Lynskey will be moving to Macon, GA 
to be the director of the legendary Allman 
Brothers Band Museum but will remain active 
in the Development Department for the school 
in the years to come. 
Moving forward (Adelante).

Lolita is a beloved friend and member of our 
community, my district, and my staff. She is a 
longtime Houston community leader, trail-

LULAC, where she was elected the first 
woman to serve as the Texas state director. 
I am grateful for the years I have shared

HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
honor a special Kentuckian and a member of 
the 2020 U.S. Olympic Team, Lee Kiefer, from 
Lexington, Kentucky. 
At the age of 5, Ms. Kiefer began the sport 
of fencing. She participated in World Cham-
pionships beginning in 2009, earning a team 
gold medal in 2018, a team silver medal in 
2017, a team bronze medal in 2019, and an 
individual bronze medal in 2011. Ms. Kiefer 
competed in the Pan-American Games in 
2011, earning gold team and individual med-
als, and in 2015, earning gold individual medal 
and a silver team medal. Ms. Kiefer was the 
youngest member of the 2009 U.S. Senior 
World Foil Team. In 2011, she was the only

HONORING THE CAREER OF NANCY 
COWSER 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate and celebrate another 
chapter of the remarkable career of local busi-
ness leader, community role model, and true 
friend to my office, Nancy Cowser. A long-es-
tablished pillar within the social services and 
economic development sectors in the eastern 
Connecticut community, Nancy will now take 
her wisdom and experiences to the world of 
academia as the chief advancement and 
alumni relations officer for Mitchell College. I 
cannot think of a better hire for one of our top 
local colleges than Nancy, as she truly rep-
resents the best and brightest in business 
leadership and community partnership in Con-
necticut. 
Having received an undergraduate degree 
in finance from Boston College and an MBA 
from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Nancy 
began her career in the banking industry as a 
mortgage auditor and exceled with her natural 
leadership and organizational skills. However, 
Nancy eventually found herself drawn to social 
services, which led her to United Community 
and Family Services (UCFS) in Norwich. As 
the senior vice president of strategy, Nancy 
worked tirelessly to ensure that constituents 
across eastern Connecticut had access to 
services such as healthcare and mental and 
substance abuse treatment to ensure each in-
dividual could experience a better quality of 
life. 
It was during her tenure with UCFS that my 
office had the first opportunity to work with 
Nancy. I believe one of the major highlights 
from both of our careers is when UCFS finally 
received designation as a Federally Qualified 
Health Center in 2015, after attempting to do 
so for eight long years. This critical designa-
tion enabled UCFS to receive significant fed-
eral funding and in turn allowed UCFS to en-
hance their primary care services and offer 
specialty care services, and Nancy was an es-
sential part of this impactful achievement. 
Nancy is someone who knows that true 
community development happens when part-
nerships are developed and organizations 
work together to meet a common goal. In her 
work, Nancy became known as a master 
networker and someone who brought every-
one to the table regardless of background or 
politics. 
Nancy’s 
reputation 
and 
skillset 
brought her enormous respect and admiration 
from community coalitions and armed her with 
tools needed to take the helm of the South-
eastern 
Connecticut 
Enterprise 
Region 
(seCTer) in 2016. 
Nancy hit the ground running as seCTer’s 
executive director. Due to her years of col-
laboration with community partners, Nancy 
knew the lay of the land and quickly got to 
work solidifying relationships and creating 
pipelines to bring economic stakeholders to-
gether. Bolstered by a series of successes 
within the seCTer loan program, PTAC, and 
the CEDS’ 2017 recognition by the National 
Association of Development Organizations as 
a national best practice model, Nancy aided 
one of the district’s largest employers, General 
Dynamic Electric Boat, in developing an exten-
sive pipeline of subcontractors to fuel the top 
submarine production force in our nation. In 
2019, with Nancy leading the way, seCTer or-
ganized our region’s largest business net-
working event, ‘‘Leading the Way’’, to connect 
General Dynamic procurement personnel with 
potential suppliers from across Connecticut 
and throughout New England. The tremen-
dous success of this event exemplified Nan-
cy’s ability to bring a multitude of diverse com-
panies under one roof to create new business 
opportunities and relationships that continue to 
flourish to this day. 
However, we must not forget, our region’s 
defense industry is only one of many sectors 
that Nancy took under her tutelage to grow. 
From breweries to manufacturers, and even 
local gyms—Nancy was always a phone call 
away to help guide any business in driving its 
potential for growth. It was this niche ability to 
work with so many diverse companies and un-
derstand each of their needs that makes 
Nancy such a pivotal business leader in our 
district. With Nancy’s departure from seCTer, 
we see the before and after of her time at the 
organization, and know that her impact that 
will continue to propel seCTer forward for 
years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I am truly proud to call 
Nancy a colleague and most importantly a 
friend. I have witnessed first-hand her profes-
sional growth and her ability to spur significant 
economic growth within the 2nd district. Now 
taking her talents to Mitchell College, our 
paths will continue to cross as we tackle the 
issues facing the academic sector. One can-
not really quantify the influence Nancy has 
had on our region, from her work at UCFS to 
seCTer, but I know that she has moved moun-
tains for our communities, and her trajectory of 
success will only continue upward. 
I ask everyone in the Chamber to please 
rise and applaud Nancy for her outstanding 
career and thank her for all that she has done 
to help Connecticut businesses and residents. 
Nancy is a true pillar of Connecticut. We wish 
her continued happiness and success.

HONORING CAPITOL POLICE OFFI-
CERS AND FIREFIGHTERS FROM 
JANUARY 6 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of our Capitol Police Officers and Fire-
fighters, including the heroes from Arlington 
County, who defended the U.S. Capitol on 
January 6, 2021. The attack on the Capitol 
was an attempt to overturn an election through 
violence and fear, and our Capitol Police and 
Firefighters stood firm to protect our democ-
racy and uphold our Constitution. 
These brave men and women risked their 
lives in their protection of those trapped in the 
Capitol. We must honor these officers who 
sustained injuries in the line of duty, including 
Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and 
Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment Officer Jeffrey Smith, two of my own 
constituents who passed away due to injuries 
from the January 6 attack. 
The United States Capitol Police protect the 
U.S. Capitol every day. They protect our legis-
lators, they protect our staff, and they protect 
journalists and other visitors. Their presence is 
imperative to the democracy that the United 
States takes pride in, and it is only fitting that 
Congress honor their courage and ideals. 
January 6, 2021 will be remembered as one 
of the darkest days of our democracy, yet that 
day will also commemorate the heroism and 
selfless bravery of the Capitol Police, D.C. 
Firefighters, and other law enforcement offi-
cers.

UPON RECEIVING THE CONGRES-
SIONAL MEDAL OF BRAVERY 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA

Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Sergeant Peter Koepp, Sergeant Mark 
Laino, Officer Christopher Watkins, and Officer 
Bobby Meis of the Virginia Beach Police De-
partment upon receiving the Congressional 
Medal of Bravery for their heroic actions on 
May 31, 2019. 
Like many in our community and around the 
nation, I was shocked and horrified to hear 
about the active shooter situation in Virginia 
Beach’s municipal building that day. The four 
officers arrived separately at the hectic scene 
before converging toward the sound of gunfire. 
Together, they approached the assailant and 
bravely exchanged gunfire, during which Ser-
geant Koepp was struck by a bullet, receiving 
blunt trauma to his abdomen. The officers’ po-
sitioning allowed city employees and citizens 
to evacuate the premises until SWAT officers 
arrived. Sadly, 12 individuals in the building 
lost their lives that day. Still, the heroism that 
Officers Koepp, Laino, Watkins, and Meis ex-
hibited may have saved countless more. 
Knowing that they would enter a high-risk 
situation, each of these officers swiftly re-
sponded to the call to action. Our community 
is eternally grateful for their courage, and it is 
my privilege to celebrate these heroes as they 
receive this well-deserved honor.

MEMORIAL RESOLUTION FOR 
HOWARD H. MILES 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I 
rise today to pay tribute to a longstanding stal-
wart from Fort Worth, Texas, Howard Henry 
Miles. It’s his birthday today, and I’d like to 
share how Howard’s contributions to our com-
munity have helped shape us for the better. 
Howard Henry Miles committed much of his 
life to his family and his community, when the 
family of seven were forced to relocate to the 
city after an unfortunate event by an angry 
White mob. The family went on to become in-
fluential pillars in the African-American com-
munity as they opened various businesses in 
which Howard took ample pride. 
Howard is a graduate of the historic I.M. 
Terrell High School. As a student, Howard ran 
track, and played the clarinet in multiple bands 
at the school before graduating in 1951. How-
ard then earned a science degree in chemistry 
in 1958 from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, 
where he was also a cherished member of the 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. Amidst his 
educational journey, Howard served as a sup-
ply clerk for the U.S. Army in the United King-
dom from 1954 to 1956 due to the Korean 
War. 
Howard Henry Miles returned to his high 
school, I.M. Terrell, as a Science teacher and 
beloved coach while he simultaneously earned 
a master of science degree in biochemistry 
from Syracuse University. Howard continued 
his teaching and coaching career at Amon 
Carter-Riverside High School in 1970 and 
Polytechnic High School in 1975 where he 
spent more than 20 years doing what he loved 
most: teaching AP science courses and 
coaching sports teams. He is respectfully re-
membered and admired by many students as 
‘‘Coach Miles,’’ one who helped break down 
racial barriers for them between the 60’s and 
70’s. 
Howard is also recognized for his tough love 
teaching style and ‘‘painstaking drills’’ which 
resulted in his girls track team winning two 
state championships for which he was recog-
nized by the Texas State House representa-
tives. Howard was given many opportunities to 
move up in his career, however his heart be-
longed to the city of Fort Worth where he re-
tired in 1999. 
Howard’s long and varied service to Fort 
Worth also includes playing in the Fort Worth 
Civic Orchestra and Arlington Band, religiously 
attending 
St. 
Andrews 
United 
Methodist 
Church serving as a youth leader, Sunday 
school teacher, male chorus member and 
youth choir director. Therefore, I am honored 
to have had Howard Henry Miles as my con-
stituent in Texas’ 33rd District.

IN RECOGNITION OF FRED ROGERS 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the exemplary life of Fred Rog-
ers, the outgoing commander of American Le-
gion Peter J. Courcy Post 178 in Frisco, 
Texas. Mr. Rogers has conducted his life with 
distinguished service to his community and 
nation through his service in the U.S. Armed 
Forces and his subsequent volunteer efforts. 
Mr. Rogers served honorably as an Air Po-
liceman in the U.S. Air Force from 1960 to 
1964. After retiring from his decades-long civil-
ian career as a pilot, Mr. Rogers joined the 
American Legion in 2008. Mr. Rogers’ leader-
ship roles at Holley-Riddle Post 21—Frisco 
and Bill Bryan Post 110—McKinney led to him 
receiving Pioneer Awards for the organization 
of those two posts. In 2013, he was named 
the Texas 4th District Adjutant. 
Being a founding post member, Mr. Rogers 
has served as Post 178’s commander since its 
inception in December 2013. His tireless ef-
forts to bolster the new post’s community in-
volvement and promote its membership led to 
Post 178 earning the Texas Post Excellence 
Award from 2015 through 2019. Only three 
posts in Texas receive this honor yearly, and 
Mr. Rogers’ dedicated leadership as com-
mander merited the award for four consecutive 
years. From 2016 to 2018, Post 178 was also 
awarded the National Post Excellence award. 
Despite the post’s recent founding, it is one of 
the most recognized and fastest growing in 
the state of Texas. 
During his time as Post 178 Commander, 
Mr. Rogers has organized Memorial Day 
events, sponsored dozens of high school jun-
iors for American Legion Boys State and 
American Legion Auxiliary Girls State, pro-
moted the annual American Legion High 
School Oratorical contest, and worked along-
side the Wreaths Across America organization 
at the Dallas-Fort Worth national cemetery. 
Mr. Rogers served as the Texas State Vice

IN HONOR OF GEREK MEINHARDT 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
honor a special Kentuckian and a member of 
the 
2020 
U.S. 
Olympic 
Team, 
Gerek 
Meinhardt, from Lexington, Kentucky. 
Mr. Meinhardt began the sport of fencing 
when he was 9 years old. In 2007, he quali-
fied for the cadet, junior, and senior world 
teams all in the same year, becoming the first 
U.S. men’s fencer ever to do so. In 2008, he 
was the youngest athlete ever to compete on 
a U.S. Fencing Team and was the youngest 
member of the 2008 Olympic Team in any 
sport. Mr. Meinhardt was a four-time NCAA 
All-American and was a two-time individual 
NCAA Champion in 2011 and 2014. Mr. 
Meinhardt was a member of the first U.S. 
Men’s Foil Team to win a Senior World Cham-
pionship title in 2019. He competed in the 
Pan-American Games in 2011, earning a gold 
team medal, and in 2015, earning another 
gold team medal and silver individual medal. 
Representing the United States of America, 
Mr. Meinhardt competed in the Beijing Olym-
pic Games in 2008, the London Olympic 
Games in 2012, the Rio Olympic Games in 
2016, and is currently on the team that will 
compete in the Tokyo Olympic Games. He 
earned a bronze medal in 2016. 
Mr. Meinhardt is the son of Kurt and Jane 
Meinhardt. His wife is also a member of Team 
USA, fellow fencer Lee Kiefer. He is a grad-
uate of the University of Notre Dame and is 
currently a student at the University of Ken-
tucky College of Medicine. 
I wish all the best to this accomplished Ken-
tucky athlete as he competes in Tokyo rep-
resenting the United States. It is my honor to 
recognize Gerek Meinhardt before the United 
States Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E765 
July 16, 2021 
House of Representatives for their tireless 
service to the House, the United States Cap-
itol Police, and Congressional Budget Office 
following the violent attack on our Capitol on 
January 6, 2021. 
Through exemplary dedication, passion, and 
commitment to their profession, the team has 
developed the OEA into a preeminent em-
ployee assistance program over three dec-
ades, delivering comprehensive confidential 
services covering an array of personal and 
work-related issues to positively impact em-
ployee performance, productivity, and well- 
being. 
The team’s commitment and care has of-
fered comfort and coping tools to those experi-
encing profound grief and distress after the 
January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. These 
services included one-to-one crisis consulta-
tion, confidential counseling, debriefings on 
trauma and resilience, discussion group facili-
tation, and the development and dissemination 
of self-help material containing practical strate-
gies to promote recovery. 
Additionally, the OEA promptly secured and 
coordinated additional counseling assets for 
their appointment-based services as well as 
for the ongoing, around-the-clock crisis sup-
port efforts that would remain available to 
Capitol Police personnel in the weeks and 
months that followed. 
Through in-person, telephonic, and video 
meetings and seminars, the OEA interacted 
with thousands of employees and family mem-
bers in the first half of 2021 alone, far sur-
passing past utilization trends. Employee en-
gagement in all their services has been un-
precedented—as have been the needs—yet 
the staff of the OEA has never flinched. 
The dedicated team provided impactful work 
not only through an extraordinary volume of 
interactions with individuals, but through reg-
ular training and briefing facilitation across the 
House, on-call responses after-hours, and on-
going efforts to promote the services through-
out the House and the Capitol Police commu-
nities. All the while, the team maintained the 
resolve and perspective to effectively help oth-
ers while processing their own attack-and-pan-
demic-related concerns as employees of this 
institution. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to acknowl-
edge the entire Office of Employee Assistance 
and Well-Being teams who served throughout 
this tremendous support effort: Tiara Ander-
son, 
Breanna 
Becker, 
Briana 
Cragwell, 
Georgeanna 
Goldstein, 
Margot 
Hawkins- 
Green, Rhonda Kaalund, Malia Klee, Liz 
McBride, Jon Murphy, Emily Swartz, Paul 
Tewksbury, and Brian Weiss. Also worthy of 
our thanks are the contracted counseling part-
ners. These special groups of professionals 
should all be commended for their commit-
ment, dedication, and professionalism during a 
time of great need. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
recognize and thank the Office of Employee 
Assistance for their extraordinary and unwav-
ering service to this institution.

INTRODUCTIONS OF THE GRANT 
RESIDENCY 
FOR 
ADDITIONAL 
DOCTORS ACT OF 2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Grant Resi-
dency for Additional Doctors, or GRAD, Act of 
2021 which would address the lengthy proc-
essing delays for J–1 visas, which is the tem-
porary nonimmigrant visa that international 
medical students and physicians use to work 
in U.S. based residency programs. 
The United States is anticipated to face a 
shortage of physicians that ranges from be-
tween 54,100 and 139,000 in the next 12 
years. The COVID–19 pandemic is expected 
to magnify these shortages as primary care 
physicians and specialists experience burnout 
related to the pandemic. Foreign medical stu-
dents frequently fill critical positions in hos-
pitals that service underserved and rural com-
munities. 
Madam Speaker, my GRAD Act of 2021 
would direct the Department of State to estab-
lish a position from March through June, the 
busiest months for school applications, whose 
sole purpose is to address J–1 visa applica-
tions with the intention of receiving graduate 
medical education or training. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has highlighted how crucial it is that our med-
ical infrastructure has the personnel necessary 
to handle a public health crisis. Our healthcare 
system cannot operate if it is facing a physi-
cian shortage.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE 
ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
MCCOMB 
PUBLIC 
LI-
BRARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 16, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
and ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the One Hundredth Anniversary of the 
McComb Public Library. The McComb Public 
Library is a staple in the local community 
where people of all ages are able to gather to 
read and learn about an array of topics. 
The library has a deep-rooted history of 
serving the people of McComb and the sur-
rounding area, and this anniversary highlights 
its commitment to the area. Its continued dedi-
cation speaks volumes about the library’s 
value to the community and is evidence of an 
unwavering devotion to public service amongst 
its staff, past and present. 
A century ago, Reverend W.D. Trumbull, the 
Church of Christ pastor in McComb, decided 
that it was time for the community to have a 
library. With the help from Mrs. C.V. Griswolf, 
Mrs. Joe Wasson, and Mrs. Sam Light, the 
McComb Public Library was created. Through-
out its history, the library has changed loca-
tions, grown, and continued to be a beacon of 
education for McComb and Hancock County. 
The generosity of community members like 
Mrs. Blanche Fletcher, who left her entire es-
tate to help construct the current building, and 
Jane Rader, who was library director for forty- 
four years, has continued to help the library 
become what it is today. 
Congratulations to the McComb Public Li-
brary on its One Hundredth Anniversary. The 
people of the Fifth Congressional District of 
Ohio are grateful for the contributions of the li-
brary and its staff to the community and wish 
them all the best in the future.
