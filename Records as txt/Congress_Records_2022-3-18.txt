PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Fair and merciful God, You love the 
just and You will not forsake the faith-
ful. Inspired and encouraged by Your 
love may we turn from our inclination 
to serve ourselves, to disadvantage oth-
ers, and to do what is good in Your 
eyes and honorable in Your sight. 
The mouths of the righteous utter 
wisdom and their tongues speak with 
equity. Lord of our lives, guard and 
guide our speech today that it would 
reflect Your goodness and uphold Your 
justice. 
Then may our decisions align with 
Your law and our feet never step from 
Your path. 
For our hope is in You. Even as the 
wicked lie in wait to pounce on the in-
nocent, even as their intentions are set 
on destroying those who wish only to 
live in peace and security, You, O Lord, 
will not leave or forsake them. 
Make firm the steps of those who de-
light in You, whose hearts are pure. 
Lift up those who stumble and uphold 
those who share generously Your gift 
of grace. 
We offer our prayer in the strength of 
Your name. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE HOUSTON LIVE-
STOCK RODEO 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 90th 
anniversary of a Houston-area commu-
nity staple, the Houston Livestock 
Show and Rodeo. 
Anyone who lives in or around Hous-
ton knows about the Houston Rodeo, 
but outside of their legendary fried 
Oreos, incredibly tasty brisket, and im-
pressive livestock shows and rodeo, it 
is a family-friendly place where fami-
lies and communities across the region 
learn about agriculture. 
The Houston Rodeo has a special 
place in my heart, Madam Speaker, as 
it does to many Texans. Growing up on 
a farm, I still remember my first trip 
to Houston was to attend the Houston 
Rodeo. 
Today, it is the world’s largest rodeo 
with attendance surpassing two million 
people. Money raised at the rodeo goes 
to scholarships. This year alone, 350 4- 
year scholarships will be awarded. 
The Houston Rodeo is a Houston 
gem. It is a Texas gem. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 
Houston Rodeo on its 90-year anniver-
sary, and I look forward to the next 90 
years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3832 
March 18, 2022 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. KELLER of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection infor-
mation confirms what we know: The 
Biden border crisis is getting worse. 
There were 164,000 illegal alien en-
counters in February of this year, up 63 
percent from February 2021. You know 
what else is up? Fentanyl seizures. 
Also, what else is up is illegal aliens 
with criminal backgrounds. 
What is down is deportations. When 
we are seeing record increases in peo-
ple coming across our border illegally, 
deportations are down. What else is 
down is the morale of Customs and 
Border Protection agents. I know this 
because I traveled with them on a ride- 
along, and they told me that it is down 
because the current administration is 
making them out to be the bad guys. 
Those are their words. 
We need to support our Customs and 
Border Protection agents to secure our 
southern border. We need to give them 
the tools they need to do their job. 
It is time for the President of the 
United States to make sure he does his 
job and keeps America safe and secures 
our southern border. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST ACT TO RESTORE 
SUPPLY CHAINS 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, vulnerabilities that have ex-
isted in our domestic supply chains for 
years were put to the test. 
The vulnerabilities of our supply 
chain resulted in consumers being 
faced with empty shelves at stores and 
small businesses struggling to reach 
consumers. 
We must act now to restore our sup-
ply chain and ensure that our economy 
is prepared for the next crisis. 
The House took the first step in pass-
ing the America COMPETES Act. As 
the House and Senate resolve dif-
ferences, we must include the supply 
chain provisions in the final House bill 
so we can repair these supply chain 
vulnerabilities. 
The supply chain provisions included 
the Supply CHAIN Act, which I led 
with Representatives BORDEAUX
and 
KINZINGER. 
We need an office of supply chain re-
silience and crisis response at the De-
partment of Commerce to monitor crit-
ical supply chains and encourage part-
nerships between the Federal Govern-
ment and industry. 
It is time to repair our supply chains 
and protect our economy. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ALABAMA HIGH 
SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAMS 
(Mr. ADERHOLT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise this morning to recognize the six 
teams from Alabama’s Fourth Congres-
sional District who recently won State 
titles in high school basketball. There 
were a total of 14 that were up for 
grabs, and schools from the Fourth 
Congressional District, which I have 
the privilege to represent, won almost 
half of them. 
In the girls finals, Marion County 
High, located in Guin and coached by 
Scott Veal, won the State title 1A. 
Deshler 
High 
School, 
located 
in 
Tuscumbia and coached by Jana Killen, 
won the State 4A title. 
And Guntersville High School, lo-
cated in Guntersville and coached by 
Kenny Hill, won the State 5A cham-
pionship. 
Over on the boys’ side, Covenant, lo-
cated in Tuscumbia and coached by 
Bret Waldrep, won the 1A title. 
Plainview High School, located in 
Rainsville and coached by Robi Coker, 
won the State 3A championship. 
And Cullman High School, located in 
Cullman 
and 
coached 
by 
Stu 
Stuedeman won the State 6A title. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate all of 
these teams, all their schools, and all 
their communities. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF HIRAM MARISTANY 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Hiram Maristany, an East Harlem 
Afro-Boricua photographer whose work 
is an ode to his beloved neighborhood 
of El Barrio and the Latino community 
as a whole. 
Hiram was the official photographer 
and a member of the Young Lords, a 
Puerto Rican activist group inspired by 
the Black Panthers, and a lifelong resi-
dent of El Barrio. 
Hiram helped found El Museo del 
Barrio in 1969, curating the institu-
tion’s visual language in its early 
years, and later serving as its director 
from 1974 to 1977. 
Hiram was always giving back to his 
community in East Harlem, serving as 
a mentor to young people and as a pho-
tographer who understood the impor-
tance 
of 
self-preservation 
and 
the 
power of images. 
Hiram knew that his photos were po-
litical, representing El Barrio from the 
perspective of our residents: Filled 
with love and pride. 
‘‘Dignidad 
over 
fame,’’ 
was 
his 
motto. I am thankful our community 
lived to see his work—and our people— 
showcased with respect and dignity. 
May his memory and his art live on 
to inspire all of us. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DANNY POWERS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
good friend of mine, Mr. Danny Powers, 
on his selection to serve as the Grand 
Marshal of Savannah, Georgia’s, 198th 
St. Patrick’s Day parade. 
The St. Patrick’s Day parade in Sa-
vannah is the third-largest St. Pat-
rick’s Day celebration in the entire 
country. We will be expecting around 
400,000 spectators to attend Savannah’s 
signature event. 
Since 1824, Savannah has been the 
home of this fabulous celebration of 
the rich Irish heritage of our city. 
The grand marshal is an honor that 
recognizes members of our community 
for their great service, and Danny is 
well-deserving of that. 
Danny has been the Chatham County 
tax commissioner for 27 years, since 
1995. During his tenure, Danny has 
boosted property tax collection rates; 
integrated online technology to im-
prove accessibility; and has added sat-
ellite offices for vehicle tag renewals. 
Danny has been an integral and influ-
ential member of the Savannah com-
munity for many years, and we are so 
grateful to have him. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Danny on this tremendous honor; he 
has earned it. 
f 
HONORING CORA FAITH WALKER 
(Ms. BUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise today in honor of a be-
loved member of our community. 
Cora Faith Walker was truly a one- 
of-a-kind leader. She constantly found 
innovative ways to advocate for those 
in our communities who had the most 
need. 
No matter the role she was called to 
serve in, Cora was unwavering in her 
commitment to uplifting those around 
her. Above all else, Cora always stood 
for what is right; for herself, for her 
loved ones, for her neighbors, for St. 
Louis, and for Missouri. 
Cora’s warmth and genuine spirit 
translated seamlessly to her legislative 
leadership, and she relentlessly advo-
cated for at-risk women, children, and 
families. 
Cora has left an indelible mark on me 
and on our district. Though we deeply 
mourn this painful, untimely loss, St. 
Louis and I celebrate her beautiful life. 
f 
HONORING HERMANTOWN BOYS 
HOCKEY TEAM 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the Hermantown 
boys hockey team, the 2022 Class A 
Minnesota State hockey champions. 
Minnesota is the State of hockey, 
and in northern Minnesota, hockey is 
not just a proud tradition of ours; for

the players, coaches, families, and fans, 
it is truly a way of life. 
It brings me great joy to see these 
athletes represent some of the best 
parts of our great Eighth District as 
State champions. 
This group of hardworking young 
players has shown what dedication, 
passion, and unwavering commitment 
can accomplish. It is a true example of 
American exceptionalism. 
I also honor the coaches for being 
outstanding role models and leaders to 
the Hawks this entire season. Head 
coach, Pat Andrews, and assistant 
coaches: Nate Buck, Matt Swanson, 
and Chad Huttel guided the team to 
not only the school’s fourth State 
championship, but also a winning sea-
son concluding with 29 wins with only 
2 losses. The Hawks secured the cham-
pionship with an exciting 3–2 win over 
Warroad. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate every 
player, coach, and fan who lifted the 
Hermantown Hawks to victory. They 
have made our district so proud, and I 
wish every team member the best as 
they continue their hockey careers.

RECOGNIZING THE CENTRAL 
DEWITT SPECIAL OLYMPICS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize some 
incredible students from Iowa’s Second 
Congressional District. 
On Saturday, March 12, the Central 
DeWitt Special Olympics basketball 
team earned a silver medal and the Sa-
bers unified dance team earned a gold 
medal at the Mid-Winter Tournament 
in Iowa City. 
For the last few years, Special Olym-
pics Iowa has put on the Mid-Winter 
Tournament as part of their ongoing 
series of events to showcase the amaz-
ing skills and talents of our athletes. 
The Mid-Winter Tournament sees 
competition in basketball, basketball 
skills, cheerleading, gymnastics, and 
powerlifting. 
Healthy 
Athletes 
screenings are also provided to athletes 
by healthcare professionals for dental, 
hearing, overall health and fitness, and 
more. 
Organizations like Special Olympics 
strive to create a better world by fos-
tering the acceptance and inclusion of 
all people. Through the power of 
sports, these athletes discover new 
strengths, skills, confidence, abilities, 
fulfillment, and success. They also 
learn the values of hard work, sports-
manship, perseverance, teamwork, and, 
most importantly, having fun. 
Special Olympics has changed the 
lives of so many amazing athletes, and 
I am proud to have them in Iowa. But 
I am even prouder of the awesome ath-
letes from Central DeWitt who are al-
ready making their mark on the world. 
Go Sabers. 
CREATING 
A 
RESPECTFUL 
AND 
OPEN 
WORLD 
FOR 
NATURAL 
HAIR ACT OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 979, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 2116) to prohibit discrimi-
nation based on an individual’s texture 
or style of hair, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 979, in lieu of 
the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary printed in the 
bill, an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 117–36 is adopt-
ed and the bill, as amended, is consid-
ered as read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 2116 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Creating a Re-
spectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act 
of 2022’’ or the ‘‘CROWN Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PUR-
POSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Throughout United States history, society 
has used (in conjunction with skin color) hair 
texture and hairstyle to classify individuals on 
the basis of race. 
(2) Like one’s skin color, one’s hair has served 
as a basis of race and national origin discrimi-
nation. 
(3) Racial and national origin discrimination 
can and do occur because of longstanding racial 
and national origin biases and stereotypes asso-
ciated with hair texture and style. 
(4) For example, routinely, people of African 
descent are deprived of educational and employ-
ment opportunities because they are adorned 
with natural or protective hairstyles in which 
hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, or worn 
in locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, or 
Afros. 
(5) Racial and national origin discrimination 
is reflected in school and workplace policies and 
practices that bar natural or protective hair-
styles commonly worn by people of African de-
scent. 
(6) For example, as recently as 2018, the U.S. 
Armed Forces had grooming policies that barred 
natural 
or 
protective 
hairstyles 
that 
servicemembers of African descent commonly 
wear and that described these hairstyles as ‘‘un-
kempt’’. 
(7) The U.S. Army also recognized that prohi-
bitions against natural or protective hairstyles 
that African-American soldiers are commonly 
adorned with are racially discriminatory, harm-
ful, and bear no relationship to African-Amer-
ican servicewomen’s occupational qualifications 
and their ability to serve and protect the Na-
tion. As of February 2021, the U.S. Army re-
moved minimum hair length requirements and 
lifted restrictions on any soldier wearing braids, 
twists, locs, and cornrows in order to promote 
inclusivity and accommodate the hair needs of 
soldiers. 
(8) As a type of racial or national origin dis-
crimination, discrimination on the basis of nat-
ural or protective hairstyles that people of Afri-
can descent are commonly adorned with violates 
existing Federal law, including provisions of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), 
section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 
1981), and the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 
et seq.). However, some Federal courts have mis-
interpreted Federal civil rights law by narrowly 
interpreting the meaning of race or national ori-
gin, and thereby permitting, for example, em-
ployers to discriminate against people of African 
descent who wear natural or protective hair-
styles even though the employment policies in-
volved are not related to workers’ ability to per-
form their jobs. 
(9) Applying this narrow interpretation of 
race or national origin has resulted in a lack of 
Federal civil rights protection for individuals 
who are discriminated against on the basis of 
characteristics that are commonly associated 
with race and national origin. 
(10) In 2019 and 2020, State legislatures and 
municipal bodies throughout the U.S. have in-
troduced and passed legislation that rejects cer-
tain Federal courts’ restrictive interpretation of 
race and national origin, and expressly classi-
fies race and national origin discrimination as 
inclusive of discrimination on the basis of nat-
ural or protective hairstyles commonly associ-
ated with race and national origin. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Federal Government should acknowl-
edge that individuals who have hair texture or 
wear a hairstyle that is historically and 
contemporarily associated with African Ameri-
cans or persons of African descent systemati-
cally suffer harmful discrimination in schools, 
workplaces, and other contexts based upon 
longstanding race and national origin stereo-
types and biases; 
(2) a clear and comprehensive law should ad-
dress the systematic deprivation of educational, 
employment, and other opportunities on the 
basis of hair texture and hairstyle that are com-
monly associated with race or national origin; 
(3) clear, consistent, and enforceable legal 
standards must be provided to redress the wide-
spread incidences of race and national origin 
discrimination based upon hair texture and 
hairstyle in schools, workplaces, housing, feder-
ally funded institutions, and other contexts; 
(4) it is necessary to prevent educational, em-
ployment, and other decisions, practices, and 
policies generated by or reflecting negative bi-
ases and stereotypes related to race or national 
origin; 
(5) the Federal Government must play a key 
role in enforcing Federal civil rights laws in a 
way that secures equal educational, employ-
ment, and other opportunities for all individuals 
regardless of their race or national origin; 
(6) the Federal Government must play a cen-
tral role in enforcing the standards established 
under this Act on behalf of individuals who suf-
fer race or national origin discrimination based 
upon hair texture and hairstyle; 
(7) it is necessary to prohibit and provide rem-
edies for the harms suffered as a result of race 
or national origin discrimination on the basis of 
hair texture and hairstyle; and 
(8) it is necessary to mandate that school, 
workplace, and other applicable standards be 
applied in a nondiscriminatory manner and to 
explicitly prohibit the adoption or implementa-
tion of grooming requirements that dispropor-
tionately impact people of African descent. 
(c) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to in-
stitute definitions of race and national origin 
for Federal civil rights laws that effectuate the 
comprehensive scope of protection Congress in-
tended to be afforded by such laws and Con-
gress’ objective to eliminate race and national 
origin discrimination in the United States. 
SEC. 3. FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—No individual in the United 
States shall be excluded from participation in, 
be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to dis-
crimination under, any program or activity re-

hair texture or that hairstyle is commonly asso-
ciated with a particular race or national origin 
(including a hairstyle in which hair is tightly

NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2116. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Creating a Re-
spectful and Open World for Natural 
Hair Act, or the CROWN Act, is a criti-
cally important civil rights bill that 
would explicitly prohibit discrimina-
tion on the basis of hair texture or 
hairstyles commonly associated with a 
particular race or national origin. It 
would do so in areas of the law where 
discrimination on the basis of race or 
national origin is already prohibited, 
such as employment, education, and 
housing. 
Although Republicans blocked pas-
sage of this bill a few weeks ago, their 
arguments have just as little merit 
now as they did then. That is why we 
are here again, to advance this impor-
tant legislation. 
Among the arguments that we heard 
previously was that this bill was not 
needed because the law already pro-
tects people from hair-based discrimi-
nation. While I agree that existing civil 
rights statutes, if properly read, al-
ready make such discrimination unlaw-
ful, several Federal courts have erro-
neously rejected this interpretation, 
leaving the state of the law unclear at 
best. 
Far from being duplicative, this leg-
islation is absolutely essential to re-
move any ambiguity from the law and 
to fix these courts’ misinterpretation 
of Federal civil rights law. 
Republicans also argued that this 
legislation could somehow undermine 
the ability of employers to maintain 
workplace safety standards. But noth-
ing could be further from the truth. 
This bill does nothing to prohibit em-
ployers from addressing safety con-
cerns, and the longstanding provisions 
under the civil rights laws that enable 
employers to ensure workplace safety 
would remain firmly in place. 
Since neither of these arguments 
holds up to scrutiny, it is important to 
step back and understand why the 
CROWN Act is so urgently needed. Ac-
cording to a 2019 study conducted by 
the JOY Collective, Black people are 
‘‘disproportionately burdened by poli-
cies and practices in public places, in-
cluding the workplace, that target, 
profile, or single them out for natural 
hairstyles,’’ and other hairstyles tradi-
tionally associated with their race, 
like braids, locs, and twists. 
This has real consequences for real 
people. Students have been sent home 
from school or told they could not 
walk at graduation. Employees have 
been told to change their hair because 
it violated their employer’s dress code. 
Some people have even been denied 
jobs altogether because of their hair-
styles. 
In view of these disturbing facts, 14 
States have enacted statutes prohib-
iting discrimination on the basis of an 
individual’s natural hairstyle, in every 
case with bipartisan support and some-
times even with the unanimous support 
of both parties. 
I am disappointed that we did not see 
such 
bipartisan 
support 
when 
we 
brought this bill up a few weeks ago, 
but my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have another chance today to 
do the right thing. This is a matter of 
basic justice that demands a national 
solution by Congress. That is why I 
strongly support the CROWN Act and 
urge all my colleagues, including my 
Republican colleagues, to do so as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3835 
March 18, 2022 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN) for her 
leadership and for introducing this im-
portant bill this Congress. I urge all 
Members to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Joe Biden inherited a relatively sta-
ble and calm world, and in 14 months, 
we have complete chaos. 
Think about last summer. Think 
about that video last summer where 
you had people trying to jump on the 
wheel of the plane as it was taking off 
in Afghanistan, that situation there, 
the debacle that was the exit from Af-
ghanistan. Think about what is going 
on in Ukraine today. 
Here at home, in 14 months, we went 
from a secure border to complete 
chaos, over 2 million illegal immi-
grants coming into this country in 1 
year. 
We went from relatively safe streets 
to record levels of crime in every major 
urban area in the country. We went 
from stable prices to record-high infla-
tion, 40-year-high inflation. We went 
from energy independence to $5 a gal-
lon gas and the President of the United 
States begging Iran and Venezuela to 
increase production. In 14 months, 
from stability to chaos. 
Today, 
what 
are 
the 
Democrats 
bringing to the floor? A bill that is ti-
tled Creating a Respectful and Open 
World for Natural Hair Act of 2022. 
That is what we are focused on today. 
How about a world where gas prices 
aren’t $5 a gallon? How about a world 
where you can actually walk safely on 
your streets and not have record levels 
of crime? How about a world where in-
flation isn’t at a 40-year high? How 
about a world where we are actually 
energy independent? Those are the 
issues we should be focused on. 
But Democrats today, Friday, March 
18, 2022, with chaos all over the place, 
this is what they are focused on. 
Madam Speaker, as the chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee just said, we 
have civil rights laws that cover any 
kind of discrimination. It is covered. It 
is wrong if it happens. But this is what 
the Democrats are focused on. Four-
teen months of chaos, and we are doing 
a bill on hair. 
I think the American people expect 
more from their Congress, expect more 
from their elected Representatives, and 
I hope we can actually focus on the 
things that matter to the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I said 
that this was covered by the law, but 
several Federal circuit courts disagree. 
Therefore, it is not covered in those 
circuits, and that is why we need this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New Jersey 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN), the sponsor of 
the bill. 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman who is 
the chairman of our Judiciary Com-
mittee for recognizing me. 
I really do wish we could concentrate 
on other issues as well, and I think 
that we are. I think that creation of 6.5 
million jobs, of unity around the world, 
of restoring dignity and respect among 
our people, trying to put our attention 
onto things as important as Build Back 
Better and taking care of the economy, 
recognizes that Joe Biden, this admin-
istration, this Democratic majority in 
the House of Representatives, can chew 
gum and walk at the same time. 
If my colleagues don’t think this is 
worthy of debate, then they should 
have gone on and done what they did 2 
years ago and vote for the bill a couple 
weeks ago. 
But here we are today. Here we are 
today standing on behalf of those indi-
viduals, whether my colleagues on the 
other side recognize it or not, who are 
discriminated against as children in 
school, as adults who are trying to get 
jobs, as individuals who are trying to 
get housing, as individuals who simply 
want access to public accommodations 
and to be beneficiaries of federally 
funded programs. 
Why are they denied these opportuni-
ties? Because there are folks in this so-
ciety who get to make those decisions 
who think that because your hair is 
kinky, it is braided, it is in knots, or it 
is not straightened blond and light 
brown, that you somehow are not wor-
thy of access to those issues. That is 
discrimination. 
There is no logical reason that any-
one should be discriminated against on 
any level because of the texture of 
their hair or the style of their hair. 
I understand that my colleagues on 
the Republican side don’t get the vast 
array of discriminatory practices be-
cause they spend so much time trying 
to perpetuate an all-White society here 
in the most diverse country in the 
world. 
Nonetheless, this bill is vitally im-
portant. It is important to the young 
girls and the young boys who have to 
cut their hair in the middle of a wres-
tling match in front of everyone be-
cause some White referee says that 
your hair is inappropriate to engage in 
your match. That young man engaged 
in his match and he won it. 
It is inappropriate for our girls to be 
sent home disciplined or pushed out 
simply because they have got braids in 
their hair. And it is doggone sure dis-
criminatory to deny someone employ-
ment, housing, or public accommoda-
tions because of the way they are wear-
ing their hair. 
That is why we are standing here 
today. It is unfortunate that we have 
to, but we do. 
With that in mind, I thank the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee for 
giving me this opportunity to speak on 
behalf of a bill that I think is vitally 
important, that represents movement 
and understanding in the 21st century, 
what discrimination can look like and 
what it can do to people. 
I urge all of my colleagues, including 
those on the Republican side that 
voted for it a couple weeks ago, to vote 
for it today. 
b 0930 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. BUSH), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise today in support of the 
CROWN Act. 
As a Black woman who loves my 
braids, I know what it is like to feel 
isolated because of how I wear my hair. 
For the last time, we say no more to 
Black people being demeaned and dis-
criminated against for the same hair-
styles that corporations profit from, no 
more to Black people being made to 
feel like we have to cut our locs just to 
get a job. 
For the last time, we say no more to 
Black people being made to feel like we 
have to straighten our hair to be 
deemed professional, no more to Black 
children being suspended from school 
because their hair doesn’t align with 
their school’s dress code. This is actu-
ally a thing. 
We are American, and we stand up 
and say no more for the last time. We 
are American. Black hair is not to be 
policed. 
Madam Speaker, I commend my col-
leagues for their work on the CROWN 
Act, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of the House of 
Representatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, we are 
going to talk about hair, but this bill is 
about discrimination. This bill is about 
equality. This bill is about individual 
integrity. That is what this bill is 
about. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this bill. I thank my friend 
from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLE-
MAN) for putting it forward. 
This bill, as I just said, is not about 
hair. It is about hair, of course, but it 
is about the reaction, the inequality, 
the discrimination, the ‘‘you are not 
welcome here if your hair texture is 
different,’’ and you have to or want to 
fix it in a certain way. 
It is about the ability of every person 
in our country to have access to edu-
cation, to economic advancements, and 
to opportunities to get ahead. 
This is an issue of civil rights. The 
legislation before us would prohibit 
discrimination based on a person’s hair 
texture or hairstyle if that style or 
texture is commonly associated with a 
particular race or national origin. 
My hair is different than BARBARA 
LEE’s, who is seated next to me. Nei-
ther one of us had anything to do with 
that. I had no way to have the texture 
of my hair any way other than what

my genetic makeup was, nor did BAR-
BARA LEE. 
Why, therefore, should there be any 
thought that anybody would be able to 
discriminate on that basis? Too often, 
styles such as locs, cornrows, twists, 
braids, Bantu knots, and Afros are 
wrongly perceived as unkempt or un-
professional. 
In fact, many of these styles are not 
only central to one’s culture and herit-
age but also based upon convenience, 
based upon a way to have an easier 
time. 
For a long time, and still today, ex-
pectations about what hairstyles are 
considered appropriate or professional, 
as the previous speaker said, have cre-
ated immense pressure to conform to a 
beauty standard of straight hair that 
requires considerable time, effort, and 
cost. This burden falls disproportion-
ately on Black Americans, particularly 
Black women and girls. 
At the same time, enforcing the 
standard sends a terrible message to 
young people about their belonging in 
society and can harm their very self-es-
teem. 
A survey commissioned by the Dove 
company found that Black women were 
80 percent more likely to change their 
natural hair to fit into an office setting 
and 11⁄2 times more likely to be sent 
home from the workplace due to their 
hair than non-Black women. 
For children and teenagers in school, 
spending time conforming their hair to 
a different standard takes away from 
their time spent doing homework or 
getting enough sleep. 
I hope I never get so old that I don’t 
remember that I really cared about: 
Did I look like the other kids in school, 
or did I look different? 
I happened to have been really skin-
ny as a kid. I am not too fat right now, 
but I was really skinny as a kid, and I 
was really self-conscious about that. 
When you are a kid, being self-con-
scious is really painful, and you feel 
put off if somehow you are different. 
For children and teenagers in school, 
spending time conforming their hair to 
a different standard takes away from 
time spent doing homework and get-
ting enough sleep, but, much more im-
portantly, their psychological well- 
being. 
This legislation recognizes that nat-
ural hair, natural hair, natural hair— 
none of us made our nature; it was 
made for us—should not be a cause for 
discrimination or denial of opportuni-
ties. 
If we treat this discrimination in the 
same way as we already treat discrimi-
nation based on race—nobody decides 
the color of their skin. It is who you 
are. It is what you have. 
As Martin Luther King told us, it is 
really irrelevant. The content of char-
acter is what is relevant—not the hue 
of skin, but how I treat others and how 
others treat me. 
That is what we meant by all men 
and women are created equal. They are 
not created the same. We are different. 
But it is the character and conduct 
that ought to govern how we are ac-
cepted and treated. 
This is similar to title VI and title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 
Fair Housing Act, and other civil 
rights laws. 
Nationwide protection is necessary 
so that no one is denied the simple dig-
nity of being one’s authentic self in 
America while having access to all op-
portunities this country offers. 
Character and conduct—our military 
took steps to end hair discrimination 
last year, if anybody thinks this isn’t a 
real issue. Obviously, the military 
thought it was an issue, and it was an 
important enough issue that they took 
action. 
The House passed this legislation in 
2020 with bipartisan support. Frankly, 
it is disappointing that 188 Republicans 
opposed this legislation last week when 
we brought it to the floor under an ex-
pedited process, under suspension. 
This should be something that all of 
us as Americans, as people who honor 
the Declaration of Independence and 
that 
statement 
that 
reverberated 
around the world of a very central 
premise that is America: ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that 
all,’’ and we said ‘‘men’’ because we 
were limited in our thought pattern at 
that point in time. But as we have 
grown, we have expanded it. 
Men and women of all different types 
and colors and, yes, sexual orientation 
are equal. Not the same, but deserving 
because God has created them, deserv-
ing of our respect and our equal treat-
ment. 
I am bringing this bill back to the 
floor, Madam Speaker, under a rule so 
that we can pass it with bipartisan sup-
port today. I think it will be bipar-
tisan. This really ought to have unani-
mous support since it is about fairness 
and nondiscrimination. 
I know that some people say, oh, this 
is going to cause some people problems 
because some people are going to claim 
that you violated my rights. Yes, that 
is America. That is why the Constitu-
tion says you have the right to redress 
grievances. 
Yes, it may have some in court, but 
you can get around it really quickly: 
Don’t discriminate. Treat people based 
upon their conduct and character. 
We must act to ensure that everyone 
can get a job, succeed in school or at 
work, find housing, and obtain eco-
nomic security without facing dis-
crimination simply because of their 
hair. 
Again, I thank my friend, BONNIE 
WATSON COLEMAN, for her leadership on 
this bill. And I urge my colleagues to 
make America a little fairer, a little 
more hewing to that basic premise of 
which I just spoke. 
Let’s pass this bill. Let’s make Amer-
ica a little more American. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the majority leader 
just said that the bill is not about hair; 
the bill is about discrimination. 
I would say he is wrong on both 
counts because disparate treatment 
cannot be based on race, color, na-
tional origin. That is already the law. 
That is constitutional. 
So, he is wrong on that statement, 
and the bill is definitely about hair. 
Here is the title of the bill: Creating a 
Respectful and Open World for Natural 
Hair. So, he is wrong on both counts. 
So, the bill is about hair. 
What the bill is not about is dealing 
with the crazy energy situation we find 
ourselves in today. The bill is not 
about opening up ANWR. The bill is 
not about increasing domestic produc-
tion of energy so we don’t have $5 gas. 
The bill is not about dealing with the 
inflation problem, the 40-year high in-
flation 
problem 
that 
this 
country 
faces, the problem that is impacting 
moms and dads and families across this 
country every single day. The bill is 
not about that. 
It is definitely about hair. It is not 
about that. 
It is not about dealing with the bor-
der situation, the 165,000 illegal en-
counters on the border last month 
alone. It is not about that. It is not 
about that. 
The majority leader was wrong when 
he said this bill was not about hair. 
That is all it is about. 
I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BISHOP), my friend and a member 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
to 
Mr. 
JORDAN’s 
point, we are beset with problems. 
Two of the most significant are that 
the Producer Price Index is at 10 per-
cent. We face a cost environment that 
is unsustainable, and that affects every 
American’s livelihood every time they 
visit a gas pump or go to the store. We 
face 
an 
employment 
environment 
where 
Americans 
have 
been 
disincentivized to work. 
Every time I speak to people in my 
district—well, it may be different in 
the last couple of weeks and the latest 
catastrophes we have seen. But cer-
tainly, until then, the leading concern 
is the availability of people who are in-
clined to work in order to fulfill job op-
portunities. 
The Judiciary Committee’s report on 
this legislation points out that I and 
Representative CLIFF BENTZ from Or-
egon raised a question about this legis-
lation in the markup, that it may pre-
vent employers from regulating hair-
styles for workplace safety reasons. 
One of the cases involved, I believe, 
was about long dreadlocks that could 
become ensnared in machinery on a 
workplace floor. 
Let me tell you what the Judiciary 
Committee’s report by the majority 
says is the answer to that problem. 
They say that concern is misplaced be-
cause under the longstanding burden- 
shifting scheme applied by courts in 
title VII cases, an employer may defeat 
a discrimination claim by asserting 
that workplace safety was a legiti-
mate, nondiscriminatory reason for

taking an adverse employment action 
against an employee, with the burden 
then shifting to the employee to prove 
that the asserted reason was a pretext 
for discrimination. 
Assuming the employee cannot dem-
onstrate that the employer’s assertion 
of workplace safety was pretextual, the 
employer would prevail against an em-
ployment discrimination claim. How 
extraordinarily comforting. 
So, if an employee wants to wear 
dreadlocks, and an employer is legiti-
mately concerned for the health and 
safety of the employee, that his scalp 
might be ripped off by a machine, then 
the employer can enter into the litiga-
tion. 
It certainly couldn’t be arbitrated. 
We took care of that yesterday right 
on the floor of the House. We have to 
have litigation. We will have expensive 
lawyers. 
We will start, get the complaint filed, 
the answer filed. Maybe there will be a 
motion to dismiss that will be denied. 
We will get into the discovery process. 
We will send out the interrogatories 
and the document requests. We will ask 
for the other occasions where some-
body has been fired, examine the proc-
esses and the practices of the employer 
for the last decade. 
b 0945 
We will get some experts in. We have 
got to have some experts to come in 
and testify to the likelihood that long 
dreadlocks are going to get caught in 
the machinery. We will have con-
flicting experts on each side. They will 
disagree. Then the court will receive a 
motion for summary judgment, say if 
there is enough evidence to submit the 
case to trial, and the judge will have a 
130-page opinion that will examine the 
burden-shifting scheme and the initial 
burden, and then the response burden, 
and the burden shifts to the employee 
to show pretext. 
And the inflation rate creeps higher, 
and the folks willing to enter into jobs 
seem to be less and less, and the catas-
trophes keep coming. But this is the 
top priority. 
I don’t think we need to drive law-
suits between Americans. I think, in 
the main, Americans well understand 
the rules of the road. As the Judiciary 
Committee itself reports, courts have 
generally even recognized that hair-
style, to the extent it is associated 
with race, as a basis for decisions on 
employment or the like, is already un-
lawful. The EEOC’s own manual says 
that discriminating on the basis of, for 
example, Afros is unlawful. 
This bill is another solution to a 
problem that doesn’t exist in any sig-
nificant scope in this country, and the 
result being inflation that gets higher, 
more supply constriction that drives 
inflation higher, more animosity and 
obstacles between employees and em-
ployers, between merchants and cus-
tomers to drive more lawsuits to pay 
more lawyers to make the quality of 
life in America so much better. That is 
where we are. That is where we are 
today on the floor of the House. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would point out again, because 
some of my Republican colleagues 
seem not to hear it, that this is the 
law, as they say, but that several cir-
cuit courts say it isn’t the law, so all 
this bill is doing is reaffirming what 
the law is, despite several circuit 
courts. And we see that the law in 
those States where the circuit courts 
have upheld it properly has not re-
sulted in any of the catastrophes we 
just heard. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the chairman yield? 
Mr. NADLER. Yes, I will. I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Is it not correct, Mr. 
Chairman, the reason this bill is on the 
floor is because Republicans voted 
against a suspension—— 
Mr. NADLER. Yes. 
Mr. HOYER. Which could have easily 
passed to say we are against discrimi-
nation? And because 188 Republicans 
voted ‘‘no,’’ this bill needed to come 
forward because, as the chairman has 
just pointed out, the law is in doubt be-
cause courts have taken different posi-
tions. I thank the chairman for yield-
ing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 2116, the Creating a Respectful 
and Open World for Natural Hair Act, 
commonly known as the CROWN Act. I 
would like to thank Speaker PELOSI, 
Chairman NADLER, and of course Con-
gresswoman BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
for bringing this bill to the floor. 
Let me just first say, we all know— 
and you have heard the debate—that 
this bill is going to take aim at prohib-
iting race-based hair discrimination. 
Let me tell the other side: I am an 
American, and this is very important 
to me and to millions of Americans. 
Yet, your arguments, you know they 
are outrageous, but they are not sur-
prising. 
Republicans, every step of the way, 
try to diminish the humanity of Black 
and Brown people, try to uphold white 
supremacy at every step of the way. 
Just listen to what you are saying in 
terms of arguing against this bill. 
For decades, Black and Brown people 
have been penalized for wearing hair-
styles, natural hairstyles deemed as 
messy, unruly, and unprofessional. We 
have seen students humiliated and un-
fairly disciplined because their braided 
hair extensions or locs were considered 
a violation of the dress code. And in 
the workplace, Black people with curly 
Afros, braids, twists or locs, or with no 
hair are often perceived as less profes-
sional than people with straightened 
hair, which negatively impacts their 
ability to be promoted or to get raises. 
Yes, personally, I have always worn 
my hair however I chose. I have worn it 
straight; I have worn it braided; I have 
worn it spiked; I have worn it curly; I 
have worn it in a big natural; you 
name it. Everyone should be able to 
make those choices without fear of re-
percussion. 
Hair discrimination is rooted in sys-
temic racism and is a real barrier to 
advancement and empowerment for our 
communities. I have been fighting to 
end this discriminatory practice for 
years. In 2014, the women of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus urged the 
Army to rescind Army Regulation 671, 
which prohibited many hairstyles worn 
by African-American women and other 
women of color, and I led an amend-
ment in the fiscal year 2015 Defense ap-
propriations bill to ban funding for this 
discriminatory rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I just want to remind you, we 
put this in the Defense appropriations 
bill to ban funding for this discrimina-
tory rule. The military understood it. 
Due to our advocacy, a few years 
later the U.S. Navy removed their dis-
criminatory policy, allowing women, 
especially women of color, to wear 
their hair in dreadlocks, large buns, 
braids, and ponytails. We owe it to our-
selves and to future generations to 
take action here in Congress to break 
down these barriers. Everyone should 
be able to show up as their authentic 
selves and passing the CROWN Act is a 
major step in that direction. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I just want to point out, the ma-
jority leader just 3 minutes ago said 
the reason the bill is on the floor today 
is because of the minority. That can’t 
happen. We don’t schedule the floor. 
The reason the bill is on the floor 
today is because the majority is bring-
ing it to the floor. 
I would love to be able to have the 
power as the minority to bring legisla-
tion to the floor because if we could, I 
tell you what, it wouldn’t be this bill. 
It would be a bill dealing with energy, 
a bill trying to bring down the price of 
gasoline, which is at $5 a gallon in 
some States. It would be a bill trying 
to deal with the border situation. I 
wish we could schedule the floor. 
Let’s hope the American people are 
going to make a change this fall and 
put us in a position where we can 
schedule the floor because if we do, if 
we get that power, we will focus on 
those kinds of issues. 
The majority leader of the House of 
Representatives just said the reason 
the bill is on the floor today is because 
of the minority. That cannot happen. I 
wish it could, but it can’t. Those are 
the kind of arguments we are getting. 
We should be focused on the issues 
the American people want us to focus 
on right now. Families across this

country, all families want us to focus 
on certain things. But not the Demo-
crats. They are going to focus on the 
hair bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, to the point just made 
by Mr. JORDAN, it does strike me that 
what is being described, by the major-
ity leader or by the chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee, is that some 
courts in the hundreds of Federal 
courts that we have—I am not even 
sure they are all Federal they are de-
scribing, but I assume so—have decided 
that this is not an issue that is covered 
under one or more of these laws. 
But you know what usually happens 
is, the Congress waits for the court sys-
tem to work this out to the United 
States Supreme Court; and when there 
is a decision there, if the decision is 
contrary to the intent of Congress, 
Congress responds. 
So again, in terms of picking up 
something that is unnecessary, that is 
what the majority is doing. It is not 
Republicans who bring the bill to the 
floor. It is not Republicans who pick a 
fight 
over 
something 
that 
most 
wouldn’t even disagree about except in 
circumstances of safety, and then the 
question becomes one of the degree of 
burden imposed on employers, whether 
you want to drive lawsuits. 
I was thinking maybe, as Mr. JORDAN 
was speaking, that it would be nice to 
bring, since the minority can get issues 
to the floor—I didn’t know that. I have 
been here just since 2019, and we have 
been in the minority the whole time. I 
can think of a lot of things we should 
bring to the floor. We should bring a 
bill to unleash American energy inde-
pendence. We really need that right 
now. Not just a bill cutting off imports 
from Russia, not just a bill driving 
prices higher so that Americans will 
not only be paying $4 and $5, thanks to 
Joe Biden, at the pump, but they will 
soon be paying $6, $7, $8 at the pump. 
If the minority could bring a bill to 
the floor, we could bring a bill to the 
floor that would say let’s open up the 
ability to drill, let’s encourage the en-
ergy industry in America to produce 
the energy that the world needs so that 
prices will be low and that Americans 
across the board, not just a few who 
have these extraneous handful of cases 
out of the whole Federal court system 
in which the result has not turned out 
the way we would like it to have 
turned out, let’s worry about the mil-
lions and millions of Americans who 
will soon have to pay $7 or $8 at the 
pump every day, while it is $4 or $5 
now. That is what I would do if the mi-
nority could bring something to the 
floor. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to point out that we don’t need 
new drilling legislation. There are 6,000 
leases which have been granted by the 
Federal Government which the oil 
companies are not drilling. They can 
drill. 
Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), a member 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2116, the 
CROWN Act. No one should be deprived 
of equal rights under the law because 
of their hair texture or style. It should 
never be the case that a person is de-
nied the opportunity to participate in 
school sports or is sent home from 
work just because of what their hair 
looks like. 
The most egregious example of this 
was a wrestling coach who had an Afri-
can-American wrestler that had to cut 
his hair to perform. He wasn’t allowed 
on the wrestling team unless his hair 
was cut because the wrestling coach 
didn’t like it. Well, the wrestling coach 
was ignorant of the fact that that 
should 
have 
been 
his 
choice. 
He 
couldn’t rise to understand it. 
Now, Mr. BISHOP
and I, we share 
something in common. We both don’t 
have a wonderful crown with glorious 
locks. And sometimes when people, 
particularly people who aren’t too 
smart, get mad at me—and I imagine 
this happens to Mr. BISHOP, too—they 
will say: You bald-headed whatever. I 
have no choice in the fact that I am 
bald headed. I had a lot of hair when I 
was young. I had more hair than Mr. 
JORDAN. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I will 
yield to the gentleman from North 
Carolina. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Let 
me just ask, do you think anyone has 
ever discriminated against you because 
you are bald? 
Mr. COHEN. Well, they have said 
things they thought were nasty. But it 
was not nasty to me because I have no 
choice in the fact that I am bald. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Did 
you bring a lawsuit? 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time. 
I am just as good a human being, just 
as smart, just as effective, and just as 
caring with or without hair; and the 
fact is it is discrimination, and it is ig-
norance. 
African Americans have been dis-
criminated against in many ways be-
cause of their hairstyles. It is a natural 
thing for African Americans, and they 
should not be penalized in the work-
place, in sports, in school, or in any 
other ways. 
I stand here for the CROWN Act. It 
was originally introduced, I think, by 
Cedric Richmond, and I joined with 
him on the Judiciary Committee to 
support it. 
I had seen problems in Tennessee 
when I was a State senator, and sup-
ported bills there to protect people who 
wore braids and whatever. I hope peo-
ple will rise up and vote ‘‘yes’’ in un-
derstanding of other people and think 
beyond themselves. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, just let me say that, unfortu-
nately, I had never taken psychology 
during my college preparation, but I do 
know certain things such as, what 
avoidance behavior is. 
I tell you, the message discipline on 
that side is just perfect. You can talk 
about the southern border and infla-
tion and all of that to avoid the topic 
of discrimination. 
Sit down. I have the floor, sir. 
You are avoiding the fact, and I know 
personally, as a person with my hair, 
that I have had people tell my em-
ployer that I was an embarrassment 
sitting in the front office because of 
the way my hair looked. 
b 1000 
And so, to avoid a big conversation 
about discrimination that has an im-
pact, particularly on African Ameri-
cans, you talk about everything else. It 
is wrong. You are not engaging and, 
quite frankly, you are not being hon-
est. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. LEE 
of California). The Chair would remind 
Members to direct all remarks to the 
Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I would just—avoiding? It sounds 
to me like the Democrats are avoiding 
the issues the American people care 
about. That is our point. I am focused 
on what the families in the Fourth Dis-
trict of Ohio come to me and talk to 
me about. They are talking to me 
about $5 a gas; guarantee it. My guess 
it is the same in all your districts as 
well. 
They are talking to me about the 
border, our southern border that has 
been 
complete 
chaos 
now 
for 
14 
months. They are definitely talking to 
me about the price of eggs, and milk, 
and butter, and food at the grocery 
store, about everything, because we are 
at a 40-year high inflation. 
Avoidance? 
The 
people 
who 
are 
avoiding the issues the American peo-
ple care about are on that side. And to 
get lectured and using that is so wrong, 
so out of touch with the American peo-
ple. Avoiding. You have got to be kid-
ding me. We want to focus on the 
issues the American people care about. 
That is the whole darn point. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. It is 
not a question of avoidance. It is a 
question of priority. 
Here is a priority. In 2020, homicides 
across America increased 30 percent, 
from 16,500, roughly, to 21,500, an addi-
tional 5,000 homicides. 
And even if you want to view it 
through a racial lens, since that seems 
to be the subject, 55 percent of homi-
cides are suffered by Black Americans, 
even though they make up 13 percent

of the population. Of the increase I just 
described, Black Americans suffer 65 
percent. 
So we could have—if the minority 
were capable of bringing a bill to the 
floor, we could bring a bill that would 
address the rising crime in America, 
the historically exceptional, histori-
cally unprecedented, I believe, at least 
I saw something since maybe 1900 or 
1902—I 
don’t 
know 
what 
the 
cir-
cumstances were then. But since then, 
the most, the highest increase of homi-
cides in a single year in the history of 
the United States, grossly dispropor-
tionately borne by Black Americans. 
Driven by rhetoric about defunding po-
lice. We could prioritize that. That 
wouldn’t be avoidance. And yet, we do 
not because, indeed, we are in the mi-
nority and the priorities are being set 
not by the minority but the majority. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Madam Speaker. And I rise today re-
minded that Dr. King addressed this 
very issue decades ago. He addressed it 
when he shared his poem with us: 
Fleecy locks and black complexion cannot 
forfeit nature’s claim. Though skin may dif-
fer, affection dwells in black and white the 
same. And were I so tall as to reach the pole 
or to grasp the ocean at a span, I must be 
measured by my soul because the mind is the 
standard of the man and woman. 
I have lived enough now, at 74 years, 
to have seen a time when Black people 
would bleach their skin. The product 
was called Bleach and Glow, so that 
they could be as white as they could 
get. 
I have lived long enough to see them 
process their hair so that they could 
make it as straight as they could get 
it. 
I have lived long enough now, how-
ever, to see Black people having de-
cided that they are going to be them-
selves; they are going to wear their 
hair as they chose; and they are not 
going to allow themselves to be dis-
criminated against because of it. 
I have lived long enough, now, to un-
derstand that it is not the color of skin 
or the texture of hair; it is the char-
acter within that determines the worth 
of men and women. 
I have lived long enough to under-
stand that Black people are American 
people, too. And when you say the 
American people don’t want it, you 
cannot exclude Black people. Black 
people would have this be on the floor. 
This is a kitchen-table issue in Black 
households 
because 
when 
Johnny 
comes home and he has been fired be-
cause of his hair, that is a kitchen- 
table issue. That is unemployment. 
That impacts unemployment. 
So we have a duty and obligation to 
do what we are doing with the under-
standing that we are going to be our-
selves. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on the floor of the House of 
Representatives, the people’s House, to 
declare that Black girls with our 
braids, locs, Afros, all forms of natural 
hairstyles and, yes, even our smooth 
alopecian bald heads, belong every-
where. 
Today, we take an important step to-
ward codifying this fact into law by 
passing the CROWN Act legislation I 
am so proud to co-lead in partnership 
with Representatives WATSON
COLE-
MAN, MOORE, LEE, and OMAR. 
For too long, Black girls have been 
discriminated against and criminalized 
for the hair that grows on our heads 
and the way we move through and show 
up in this world. 
In my home State, the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts, two twin sis-
ters, Deana and Mya, high school stu-
dents, were disciplined for showing up 
with braids. They were given numerous 
detentions, kicked off the track team, 
banned from prom, solely for their 
hairstyle. 
In their own words, these scholars 
and athletes were judged more for their 
heritage than their homework. 
No more. 
For those sisters and thousands of 
other students who face discrimination 
based on their hair, the CROWN Act is 
for you. 
For recent graduates who fear they 
must change their hair or cut their 
locs to secure a job, the CROWN Act is 
for you. 
For our elders who have faced and 
fought this racism for generations, the 
CROWN Act is for you. 
Just yesterday, the Massachusetts 
State legislature made history by pass-
ing similar legislation. By passing the 
CROWN Act today, we affirm, say it 
loud, Black is beautiful and so is our 
hair. 
Whether you are a student in a class-
room, an employee in the workplace, or 
the next Supreme Court Justice, or the 
Speaker pro tem, you deserve to show 
up as your full self, rocking your crown 
with your head held high. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for every person 
who has been asked to shrink or to 
apologize simply for the beautiful way 
with which God made them. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
some many years ago, with a bush as 
big as a bush on my head, an Afro, of 
which I was enormously proud, young, 
fragile ego, probably not that strong in 
my frame, some would say, skinny legs 
and high heels, an early teen, trying to 
express the pain that I felt, living in a 
segregated world, trying to assert the 
prominence of my community, my race 
of people, trying to associate belatedly 
with the foot soldiers and the battering 
and the insults that they received, try-
ing to come to grips with the assas-
sination of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Bobby Kennedy, Malcolm X, I wore this 
bush, which I had to do extreme things; 
for the original style, as was done to 
young girls, is processed. It burned be-
yond recognition. 
And I went out with my grand-
mother, a woman of tradition and, 
fearful for me, she asked me to go back 
because she couldn’t walk with me 
with an Afro. The reason, of course, 
was her fear what an Afro signified, 
what it would do, how I would be 
harmed. Those were the conflicts and 
strife that Black people went through 
trying to come to grips with their iden-
tity. 
Madam Speaker, I say to my good 
friend, Mr. JORDAN, we never encounter 
each other because we have mutual re-
spect, as I do for him, and he does for 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE. We don’t really 
get into it because we know we are the 
kind of folk that stand down from each 
other. But I enjoy engaging with the 
gentleman. I enjoy his leadership. And 
his constituents have every right to be 
concerned about gas prices. 
My constituents are concerned about 
eating, being able to pay their rent. 
And I believe we can walk and chew 
gum at the same time. Let’s get to-
gether about gas prices, and paying 
rent, and people eating, and having 
jobs, and ending discrimination. Why 
can’t we do that together? 
Because 
the 
gentleman 
has 
not 
walked in my skin. He has got to un-
derstand what it means when we are 
talking about a report that has been 
given. In 2019, the Joy Collective, the 
CROWN Act coalition: Black people are 
disproportionately burdened by poli-
cies, and practices in public places, in-
cluding the workplace, that target, 
profile, or single them out for their 
natural hairstyle. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MOORE of Wisconsin). The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. I yield the gentle-
woman an additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The CROWN 
Study found that Black women’s hair 
is more policed in the workplace, 
thereby contributing to the climate of 
group control. 
Black women are more likely to re-
ceive formal grooming policies; and 80 
percent of Black women believe that 
they had to change their hair to be in 
the workplace. 
Just imagine, just imagine the beau-
ty of these hairstyles, Mr. JORDAN, the 
beauty of these hairstyles. This is what 
we are talking about; people who are 
severely discriminated against, young 
boys, young girls. A little girl in a 
Catholic school could not wear her 
hair, had to go home. 
Or the fabulous Serena, who gives joy 
to all of us and, yet, these are the locs 
that she is wearing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired.

March 18, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. I yield the gentle-
woman an additional 15 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. And this young 
boy, who, like me, felt diminished be-
cause someone thought it was wrong 
for me, an Afro, for him, his braided 
hair. 
Mr. JORDAN, we have engaged in a 
lot, but I will not stand down on the 
CROWN Act. We must pass the CROWN 
Act to give dignity and reaffirm the 
rights of all people. Wear your hair as 
you desire. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support 
of H.R. 2116, the Creating a Respectful and 
Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2021. 
This 
legislation 
prohibits 
discrimination 
based on hair texture or hairstyles if that style 
or texture is commonly associated with par-
ticular race or national origin. 
The bill also prohibits this type of discrimina-
tion against those participating in federally as-
sisted programs, housing programs, and em-
ployment. 
I have long believed that discrimination 
based on hair texture and hairstyle is an im-
permissible form of race discrimination. 
According to a 2019 report, known as the 
CROWN Study, which was conducted by the 
JOY Collective (CROWN Act Coalition, Dove/ 
Unilever, National Urban League, Color of 
Change), Black people are ‘‘disproportionately 
burdened by policies and practices in public 
places, including the workplace, that target, 
profile, or single them out for their natural hair 
styles—referring to the texture of hair that is 
not permed, dyed, relaxed, or chemically al-
tered.’’ 
The CROWN Study found that Black wom-
en’s hair is ‘‘more policed in the workplace, 
thereby contributing to a climate of group con-
trol in the company culture and perceived pro-
fessional barriers’’ compared to non-Black 
women. 
The study also found that ‘‘Black women are 
more likely to have received formal grooming 
policies in the workplace, and to believe that 
there is a dissonance from her hair and other 
race’s hair’’ and that ‘‘Black women’s hair-
styles were consistently rated lower or ‘less 
ready’ for job performance.’’ 
Among the study’s other findings are that 80 
percent of Black women believed that they 
had to change their hair from its natural state 
to ‘‘fit in at the office,’’ and that they were 83 
percent more likely to be judged harshly be-
cause of their looks. 
The study indicated that Black women were 
one and a half times more likely to be sent 
home from the workplace because of their 
hair, and that they were over three times more 
likely to be perceived as unprofessional com-
pared to non-African American women. 
Eight years ago, the United States Army re-
moved a grooming regulation preventing 
women servicemembers from wearing their 
hair in dreadlocks, a regulation that had a dis-
proportionately 
adverse 
impact 
on 
Black 
women. 
The decision was a result of the 2014 order 
by the Secretary of Defense at the time, 
Chuck Hagel, who was reviewing the military’s 
policies regarding hairstyles popular to African 
American women. 
This decision to review these policies came 
after complaints from members of Congress, 
including myself, saying that these polices un-
fairly targeted black women. 
Hair discrimination is common, and the 
CROWN Study demonstrates that, but I would 
also like to take the time to share numerous 
stories from many Americans across the coun-
try in order to put faces and names to these 
statistics. 
In 2017, a Banana Republic employee was 
told by a manager that she was violating the 
company’s dress code because her box braids 
were too ‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘unkempt.’’ 
A year later, in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a 
New Jersey high school student, was forced 
by a white referee to either have his 
dreadlocks cut or forfeit a wrestling match, 
leading him to have his hair cut in public by 
an athletic trainer immediately before the 
match. 
Again in 2018, an 11-year-old Black girl in 
Louisiana was asked to leave class at a pri-
vate Roman Catholic school near New Orle-
ans because her braided hair extensions vio-
lated the school’s policies. 
In 2019, two African American men in Texas 
alleged being denied employment by Six Flags 
because of their hairstyles—one had long 
braids and the other had dreadlocks. 
In the following year of 2020 there were 
news reports of a Texas student who would 
not be allowed to walk at graduation because 
his dreadlocks were too long. 
Finally, I’d like to share the story of a young 
man from my district, who was suspended 
from school just last year for his natural 
dreadlocks. 
DeAndre Arnold was a senior at Barbers Hill 
High School in Houston, Texas. 
Arnold had his dreadlocks for years and this 
hairstyle had become a part of his identity and 
allowed him to embrace his culture. 
Arnold’s family is from Trinidad and the men 
in his family often grow their locks near or 
below their waist. 
Arnold had complied with the dress code 
throughout high school by keeping his hair up. 
His high school routinely inspected his hair 
for violating a hair length school policy; upon 
inspection they ultimately decided to suspend 
him for violating the policy. 
Arnold was not allowed to return to school, 
attend his senior prom, or his graduation cere-
mony unless he cut his hair. 
Thankfully Arnold was able to take this deci-
sion to court, where the judge ruled that he 
could return to school without fear of recrimi-
nation. 
However, Arnold’s high school failed him, as 
students in our society should not have to un-
dergo litigation just to peacefully obtain an 
education. 
Students like DeAndre Arnold should not be 
faced with the impossible choice of either sup-
pressing their cultural heritage and Black iden-
tity by cutting their natural hair, or forfeiting 
their right to equal educational and extra-
curricular opportunities. 
People of color, especially Black people, 
have long felt pressure to alter their natural 
hair to conform to what society has deemed 
‘‘acceptable.’’ 
The CROWN Act prohibits discrimination in 
federally funded programs and activities based 
on an individual’s hair texture or hairstyle if it 
is commonly associated with a particular race 
or national origin, including ‘‘a hairstyle in 
which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, 
dreadlocks, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu 
knots, and Afros.’’ 
The legislation also provides that the prohi-
bition will be enforced as part of Title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits dis-
crimination based on race, color, or national 
origin in federally funded programs, and that 
violations of Section 3(a) will be treated as if 
they were violations of Section 601 of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. 
The CROWN Act would end the demeaning 
practice of forcing conformity onto people of 
color. 
It would make it illegal for employers and 
educators to deny an individual employment or 
educational opportunities due to the length, 
texture or style of their hair. 
To be frank, it is a tragedy that we need 
federal legislation to end these discriminatory 
practices and give people of color the dignity 
that is their inherent right. 
The CROWN Act says to Americans facing 
discrimination that the Congress of the United 
States hears them, sees them, and affirms 
their beauty and dignity and pride in their cul-
ture. 
I rise in strong support of this bill so that 
men and women of color no longer feel that 
they cannot or should not enter certain spaces 
because they wish to wear the hair that they 
are born with. 
I strongly urge all Members to join me in 
voting for the passage of H.R. 2116, the 
CROWN Act. 
I include in the RECORD a May 20, 2021 
article entitled: ‘‘Opinion: Stop polic-
ing people of color’s hair and pass the 
CROWN Act.’’ 
[From Chron.com, May 20, 2021] 
OPINION: STOP POLICING PEOPLE OF COLOR’S 
HAIR AND PASS THE CROWN ACT 
Texas seems to be hell bent on policing 
Black peoples’ hair—and it needs to stop. Im-
mediately. 
In Troy, an 11-year-old Native and African- 
American student spent more than a week in 
in-school suspension after administrators 
said his braided hairstyle violated the dress 
code, per 25 News KXXV’s Jarell Baker. 
Barbers Hill Independent School District 
voted unanimously in July of 2020 to uphold 
a school policy that allowed the district to 
suspend DeAndre Arnold and his cousin 
Kaden Bradford for refusing to cut their 
dreadlocks, even barring Arnold from his 
senior prom and high school graduation. 
Such incidents are far from isolated in the 
Lone Star state, which begs the question: 
Why are Texas schools so determined to up-
hold dated rules that seemingly exist only to 
police the appearance of Black and brown 
students? 
People of color, especially Black people, 
have long felt pressure to alter their natural 
hair to conform to what society has deemed 
‘‘acceptable.’’ It’s demeaning, and—quite 
frankly—sad. And it’s time we proudly 
rocked all of our kinks and curls without 
being punished for it. 
That’s why the CROWN Act is important. 
‘‘Creating a Respectful and Open World for 
Natural Hair,’’ or CROWN, is an act that 
would prohibit race-based hair discrimina-
tion in Texas schools and workplaces. The 
CROWN Act would make it illegal for em-
ployers and educators to deny an individual 
employment or educational opportunities 
due to the length, texture or style of their 
hair. 
It’s sad that there even has to be a law in 
place, considering no other race has to deal 
with their hair being a Civil Rights issue. 
But here we are. 
The law hasn’t passed in Texas (yet), but 
with April 27 being Texas’ CROWN Act Day, 
Texas Legislative Black Caucus members are 
working around the clock to see that it hap-
pens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3841 
March 18, 2022 
As a Black woman, I am tired of feeling 
like I can’t or shouldn’t enter certain spaces 
because my hair ‘‘isn’t done’’ or straight-
ened. I am tired of being asked if my hair is 
real or if someone can touch it. It’s the hair 
I was born with, not a science experiment. 
This is also the reason people of color get 
so upset about outside races wearing braids 
or other protective hairstyles. The issue is 
not the style itself, but the fact that you 
have an entire group of people who are seen 
as ‘‘less professional’’ in the workplace and 
even denied jobs for rocking styles they cre-
ated while others are allowed to copy it and 
receive compliments? It’s disgusting. 
The CROWN Act is necessary for the cul-
ture, and the fact that Texas isn’t moving 
quicker to pass it is quite telling. 
Whether anyone wants to admit it, hair 
discrimination is race discrimination. And 
we’ve had enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS). 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
CROWN Act because all hair is profes-
sional hair. 
While serving in the Georgia State 
Senate, a colleague greeted me with 
what she thought was a compliment. 
After spending most of the legislative 
session in braids, I had my natural hair 
pressed straight. She told me, NIKEMA, 
you should keep your hair that way. It 
looks better, more professional, more 
like a State Senator. 
Remarks like this are all too famil-
iar for Black women and girls; unac-
ceptable on their own, but the outright 
discrimination that flows from them is 
worse. If I didn’t work for the people in 
Congress, I know that I could be fired 
simply for wearing my hair in braids. 
Nothing about this is okay, so I 
make it a point to create an environ-
ment where my team feels comfortable 
wearing their crowns in every texture. 
Everybody deserves this level of safe-
ty, no matter where they work. Our 
hair is an expression of our authentic 
selves. Braids, locs, coils, or a silk 
press, all hair is professional hair. 
Discrimination has no place in Amer-
ica; 
that 
includes 
discriminating 
against Black hair. The CROWN Act 
would make race-based hair discrimi-
nation a thing of the past, once and for 
all, and that is why we should pass it 
today. 
b 1015 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, for 
all the reasons we have talked about 
and what we should be focused on here, 
I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the legisla-
tion and hope my colleagues will do the 
same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, while racism and 
discrimination sometimes appear in 
overt forms, they can also manifest 
themselves in more subtle ways. 
One way is through discrimination 
based on natural hairstyles and hair 
textures associated with people of a 
particular race or national origin. 
This CROWN Act would make ex-
plicit that civil rights laws prohibit 
such discrimination. This is a matter 
of basic fairness and justice. 
This bill passed the House last Con-
gress unanimously, and I hope we will 
do so again today. 
All the arguments we have heard 
about everything else are interesting 
and important but not relevant to this 
bill. This bill is purely about discrimi-
nation, purely about protecting people 
from discrimination, and we ought to 
pass it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this important legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, on 
H.R. 2116, the Creating a Respectful and 
Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2021, I am 
not currently recorded as a cosponsor. It was 
my intention to serve as a cosponsor of this 
legislation, but because the bill has now been 
reported by the appropriate Committees and 
placed on the Union Calendar, I am not able 
to do so. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 979, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 235, nays

AMERICANS 
NEED 
PROTECTION 
FROM CORPORATE GREED AND 
ABUSE 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, we need 
to protect the American people from 
corporate greed and abuse. The FAIR 
Act is one of those protections. 
Corporations use forced arbitration 
clauses to deny Americans their right 
to seek accountability and justice in 
disputes with private companies. They 
literally eliminated any chance a resi-
dent may have for accountability and 
justice from a dispute, specifically in 
the place of employment. 
From employee handbooks to bank 
documents to college admission paper-
work, companies include forced arbi-
tration clauses as the main form of dis-
pute resolution so that they can rig the 
rules and appoint themselves judge and 
jury in the arbitration process. 
Forced arbitration is a private, secre-
tive system without any enforceable 
standards or legal protections for our 
people. There is no public disclosure of 
proceedings or any requirements for ar-
bitrators to follow the law. 
Madam Speaker, forced arbitration 
makes it virtually impossible for anti-
discrimination laws, disability rights 
laws, and so many other important 
laws to be enforced at the Federal 
level. 
To put it simply, this is unjust, and 
has failed the American public for far 
too long. 
Earlier this year, President Biden 
signed a law ending forced arbitration 
for cases involving sexual assault or 
sexual harassment. 
So I urge the Senate to pass this leg-
islation and send it to the President’s 
desk so that we can protect the rights 
of consumers and workers from cor-
porations that seek to exploit them. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RALPH 
AHN 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Mr. Ralph Ahn, a pioneer in the Ko-
rean-American community, who exem-
plified the American Dream. 
Ralph was the youngest child of 
Dosan Ahn Chang Ho, and Ralph joined 
the United States Navy and bravely 
served our country fighting in World 
War II. 
Ralph eventually started acting, fol-
lowing in the footsteps of his older 
brother, Philip Ahn, who was one of the 
first Asian-American actors. 
Ralph made his film debut as a Ko-
rean prisoner in ‘‘Battle Circus’’ before 
taking on the roles in ‘‘Mission Over 
Korea,’’ 
‘‘Prisoner 
of 
War,’’ 
‘‘The 
Hook,’’ ‘‘It Takes Two,’’ ‘‘The Golden 
Girls,’’ and most recently as Tran on 
‘‘New Girl.’’ 
I remember last seeing Ralph at an 
event about a year ago commemo-
rating the Korean-American Pioneers 
and Korean independence. 
While I am sad that the last genera-
tion of Korean-American leaders have 
passed, I know that their legacy will 
continue to live on. I offer my deepest 
condolences 
to 
his 
beautiful 
wife, 
Anne, and his family.

REMEMBERING SHAR KNUTSON 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to remember Shar Knutson, 
former president of the Minnesota 
AFL–CIO, who passed away last month. 
Shar was a bridge-builder, trailblazer, 
and mentor. 
Shar was a lifelong advocate for 
workers in St. Paul and across Min-
nesota. A trailblazer herself, the first 
woman to lead the Minnesota AFL– 
CIO, she mentored women in the labor 
movement and urged them to run for 
leadership. 
She was a strong booster for pro- 
women labor supporters seeking public 
office. Her early and steadfast support 
and encouragement was instrumental 
to me in helping to run for Congress 
and advance our common values to-
gether. 
Hosting Shar as my guest for Presi-
dent Obama’s first official State of the 
Union address in Washington, D.C., was 
a privilege. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a February 22, 2022, article 
from the Union Advocate newspaper in 
St. 
Paul 
paying 
tribute 
to 
Shar 
Knutson’s life and work. 
[Feb. 22, 2022] 
REMEMBERING SHAR KNUTSON: ‘HER PRESENCE 
WILL BE MISSED, BUT HER LEGACY LIVES ON’ 
(by Union Advocate) 
Shar Knutson ascended the ranks of Min-
nesota’s labor movement, starting as a mem-
ber of AFSCME Local 1842 in St. Paul and re-
tiring after six years in the state’s highest 
union office. Remembered by colleagues and 
friends as a bridge-builder, trailblazer and 
mentor, Knutson died Feb. 2 at the age of 72. 
A native of Fridley who made St. Paul her 
home, Knutson made history in 2009 as the 
first woman elected president of the Min-
nesota AFL–CIO, the federation of over 1,000 
affiliate unions representing 300,000 working 
people statewide. 
Knutson held the office until 2015, during a 
tumultuous time for American unions. Ef-
forts to weaken workers’ bargaining power 
and roll back labor standards succeeded in 
other states, but not in Minnesota. Under 
Knutson’s leadership, Minnesota unions not 
only kept ‘‘right to work’’ and other anti- 
union measures at bay, but they lobbied to 
expand collective bargaining rights and pass 
the first statewide minimum-wage increase 
in a decade. 
‘‘Shar played an active role in the success-
ful campaign to increase labor’s voice in na-
tional, state and local issues, including rais-
ing awareness and promoting community de-
bate about social and economic justice,’’

U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum said. ‘‘This shift 
laid the groundwork for important progress 
being made today that benefits all Minneso-
tans.’’ 
Labor leaders who worked with Knutson 
recalled her attention to detail, quiet resolve 
and ambition. 
‘‘She got her facts, and she moved for-
ward,’’ said Ray Waldron, Knutson’s prede-
cessor as president of the state AFL–CIO. 
‘‘She was very decisive.’’ 
It showed, Waldron remembered, when he 
approached Knutson in 2009 with the news 
that he planned to retire. Knutson had been 
serving as president of the St. Paul Regional 
Labor Federation and, previously, the St. 
Paul Trades and Labor Assembly for more 
than a decade. ‘‘I walked into her office and 
said, ‘How would you like to run for presi-
dent of the Minnesota AFL-CIO?’ ’’ Waldron 
said. ‘‘Shar didn’t hesitate. She just said yes, 
reached across her desk, shook my hand, and 
I walked out.’’ 
Though self-assured, Knutson ‘‘was never a 
bully,’’ said Harry Melander, former head of 
the St. Paul and statewide Building Trades 
councils. Rather, she built her career on a 
knack for bringing people into the decision- 
making process and working in coalition. 
‘‘We all love each other, we’re family,’’ 
Melander said. ‘‘But families have fights. 
Shar made a point to make sure everyone, 
whether you got along within the labor fam-
ily or not, was at the table when we had a 
big item to discuss, so we could figure this 
out together.’’ 
Knutson grew up in a union household, but 
her ties to the labor and political commu-
nities deepened after leaving a public-health 
job with the City of St. Paul in 1990 to work 
for Mayor Jim Scheibel. At City Hall, she 
shared an office and a budding friendship 
with Molly O’Rourke, who said the two 
‘‘bonded over that experience of working in a 
very fast-paced and energized office.’’ 
Knutson was the mayor’s liaison to orga-
nized labor and other constituent groups, in-
cluding the emerging immigrant and refugee 
communities. It was a good fit, O’Rourke 
said, given Knutson’s ‘‘belief that everyone, 
no matter their station in life, needed to be 
treated with dignity and respect.’’ 
Scheibel declined to run for re-election in 
1993, and Knutson went to work for the 
Trades and Labor Assembly. Delegates elect-
ed her president in 1998, and within weeks of 
taking office, St. Paul’s new mayor, Norm 
Coleman, stunned the city’s unions with a 
proposal to privatize a swath of city services, 
from golf courses to the water department. 
Coleman’s 
‘‘Compete 
St. 
Paul’’ 
plan 
threatened hundreds of city jobs, and union 
leaders looked to the Assembly to fight 
back, said Barb Kucera, then editor of The 
Union Advocate newspaper. Knutson worked 
quickly to convene the St. Paul Works Alli-
ance, a coalition of groups that would oppose 
the privatization scheme. 
‘‘Right away, Shar brought in as many 
stakeholders as possible to be part of the dis-
cussion, leading with the unions but inviting 
other organizations too,’’ Kucera said. ‘‘She 
really decided to mount a public campaign, 
and that’s what eventually stopped the 
whole idea in the fall of 1999. ‘‘Shar really 
pushed the organization to focus and get a 
clear message across, and she did a lot of 
media appearances and events and public 
speaking. They talked about jobs, but they 
didn’t make it about jobs only. They very 
wisely chose to make it clear this was going 
to be a real threat to public services in the 
city, particularly the water service.’’ 
Defeating Coleman’s plan drew national at-
tention, and Knutson was among a handful of 
local labor council presidents invited to 
serve on an advisory committee to the AFL- 
CIO Executive Board. ‘‘She was willing to 
try to do some things differently, and she 
projected a different image, being the first 
woman and first public employee in that 
job,’’ Kucera said. 
‘‘She surprised a lot of people in Wash-
ington, D.C.,’’ Waldron added. ‘‘She was cou-
rageous.’’ Knutson’s profile continued to 
grow after another successful, coalition- 
based campaign in 2006, this time to save 500 
jobs at a paper recycling plant in the Mid-
way. The plant, then owned by Rock-Tenn, 
needed a new power source after Xcel Energy 
stopped burning coal at its High Bridge 
plant. But opposition from neighborhood 
groups put Rock-Tenn’s future—and the jobs 
of Steelworkers like Bob Ryan—in doubt. 
Ryan, who now works as the rapid response 
coordinator for his union, called Knutson 
‘‘instrumental’’ in keeping USW Local 264 
members working in St. Paul. 
‘‘It was a lot of public meetings, and Shar 
was at a lot of them with us, speaking on our 
behalf,’’ he said. Both Knutson and her fa-
ther had worked at the facility, he said, ‘‘so 
Shar could talk to people with true emotion 
about how long the plant had been there and 
its connection to the city. She just deliv-
ered.’’ 
By then, the Assembly had merged with 
surrounding labor councils to form the Re-
gional Labor Federation, with Knutson as 
president. She won a three-way race for 
president of the state AFL–CIO in August 
2009, and guided the union campaign to elect 
Minnesota’s first labor-endorsed governor in 
20 years, Mark Dayton, a year later. 
As her list of accomplishments grew, 
Knutson continued to prioritize her work to 
mentor women and young workers pursuing 
leadership roles in the labor movement and 
in politics. 
Those fields were even more male-domi-
nated 22 years ago, when McCollum became 
just the second Minnesota woman elected to 
federal office, than they are today. The 4th 
District 
congresswoman 
remembered 
Knutson and longtime friend Robin Madsen, 
an AFSCME leader who died in 2017, teaming 
up to host a ‘‘Working Women for Betty’’ 
campaign-kickoff event after McCollum an-
nounced her first run for Congress. 
Knutson and McCollum remained friends 
as their careers progressed. Knutson at-
tended President Barack Obama’s first State 
of the Union address as McCollum’s guest, 
and the congresswoman presented her friend 
with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol upon 
her retirement from the Minnesota AFL– 
CIO. 
‘‘I am thankful I had the opportunity to 
know and work with Shar Knutson,’’ McCol-
lum said. ‘‘Her presence will be missed, but 
her legacy lives on.’’ 
Jennifer Guertin, president of AFSCME 
Local 2508, called Knutson a source of ‘‘quiet 
support’’ going back to the days when dele-
gates to the Trades and Labor Assembly 
were ‘‘75 to 80 percent men.’’ 
‘‘There were times when I was so frus-
trated by the guys that I was like, ‘I’m done, 
I can’t do this anymore,’ ’’ said Guertin, now 
the federation’s sergeant at arms. ‘‘Shar 
would take me aside and say, ‘You have to 
learn how to deal with people that don’t 
know what you’re capable of. You can’t let 
them win.’ ’’ 
Current Regional Labor Federation Presi-
dent Kera Peterson counts herself among the 
countless other union members Knutson 
took time to mentor. 
‘‘President Knutson helped us grow as peo-
ple, advocates and leaders, and she fostered 
connections among us,’’ Peterson said. ‘‘I 
don’t know that many of us realized it at the 
time, but Shar was building a network of 
union and community activists with an eye 
towards our future. ‘‘I’m grateful that she 
took a long view on what our labor move-
ment can accomplish together, and for the 
investments she made in all of us.’’ 
Knutson was also quick to remind young 
activists about the importance of work-life 
balance. ‘‘A lot of times during campaigns, 
when I was pretty much living at the Labor 
Centre because that’s what we did, she was 
the one to tell me that I needed to go home 
sometimes, too,’’ Guertin said. Knutson, who 
raised two daughters as a single working 
mother, ‘‘was really dedicated to her fam-
ily,’’ O’Rourke said. ‘‘I think they gave her a 
lot of strength.’’ 
Although Knutson spent more time with 
family and friends after retiring in 2015, Alz-
heimer’s disease progressively limited her 
independence. 
‘‘It was hard to see such a strong and pow-
erful and articulate woman not really know 
the amazing impact she had on people 
around her,’’ O’Rourke said. 
‘‘She was a friend of mine, a good friend to 
me and to a lot of people,’’ Melander added. 
‘‘It’s hard because she didn’t have enough 
time to enjoy the fruits of her labor.’’ 
Knutson’s family has published an obit-
uary at BradshawFuneral.com. They plan to 
hold her memorial service later this spring. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
am thankful for the opportunity to 
work with Shar Knutson and to call 
her a friend. Her presence will be 
missed, but her legacy lives on.

HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, inflation 
is a thief, and many of us believe that 
the Federal Reserve is behind the curve 
in fighting that thief. 
History is repeating itself, Madam 
Speaker, and Jay Powell is now fight-
ing and facing precisely what his prede-
cessor Arthur Burns called the ‘‘an-
guish of central banking’’ in 1979. 
Sustained stagflation, high current 
inflation, growing high inflationary ex-
pectations, and now a commodity 
shock, these are all of the problems 
that Chair Burns faced in the 1970s. 
While I welcome the Fed’s action to 
shrink the balance sheet and start with 
the 25 basis-point increase in short- 
term rate targets, this process should 
have started in 2020. In my view, they 
should have been more aggressive this 
week and supported a 50 basis-point in-
crease in short-term rates. 
It is time for Congress to reassess 
and debate the central bank’s mandate. 
In my view, the Fed should have a sin-
gle mandate focused on containing in-
flation and keeping prices in check for 
Americans at the pump, at the grocery 
store, and whenever they pull out their 
wallet.

for the community project funding the 
Fourth Congressional District of Illi-

These crucial funds, totaling over $10 
million, will expand affordable hous-
ing; improve access to healthcare; sup-
port violence prevention and coun-

around a community swimming pool, 
an absolute must-have in the windy

Working class, immigrant neighbor-

RECOGNIZING TODD AND LOUISE 
MALECHA 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Todd and Lou-
ise Malecha, the 2022 winners of Farm 
Journal’s Top Producer of the Year 
award. 
Located in the heart of Minnesota’s 
Seventh 
Congressional 
District 
in 
Villard, Minnesota, Malecha Enter-
prises is a multi-generational, family- 
run dairy, pumping, and custom work 
operation. 
Both Todd and Louise grew up on 
dairy farms, and now five of their seven 
children are in the family business. 
Louise loves being able to see the next 
generation getting involved and taking 
up the reins. 
Their company values include integ-
rity, trust, and a commitment to con-
stant and never-ending improvement. 
With values like that, it is no wonder 
they received such a prestigious award. 
Congratulations to the Malechas for 
this impressive achievement.

CONDEMNING HATE CRIMES 
AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the 1-year 
anniversary of the Atlanta spa shoot-
ings. 
Across our country, the Asian-Amer-
ican community has been under attack 
because of misinformation and xeno-
phobia that wrongly blamed them for 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
On March 16, 2021, 1 year ago, in At-
lanta, eight innocent people, six of 
whom were women of Asian descent, 
were senselessly murdered. The victims 
of this attack included mothers and 
grandmothers, fathers and sons, teach-
ers, and veterans. These are lives that 
cannot be restored, leaving pain that 
cannot be forgotten. 
These attacks in Georgia were a 
wake-up call for the public to the re-
ality the Asian-American community 
is facing each and every day. 
Acts of violence like these dem-
onstrate why we must always call out 
bigotry and hate whenever or wherever 
we see it. We must all speak out 
against it. 
I would like to thank CAPAC Chair 
JUDY CHU for her leadership on this 
issue and encourage my colleagues to 
continue to speak out as we stand to-
gether with the Asian-American com-
munity. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S ENERGY 
PLAN 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden administration has a backup 
plan to address rising gas prices, if 
their Secretary of Transportation’s 
comical 
recommendation 
for 
every 
American to buy an electric car doesn’t 
pan out. Unfortunately, the plan in-
cludes secret talks with Venezuela, led 
by corrupt dictator Nicolas Maduro, 
about lifting sanctions on importing 
Venezuelan oil into the United States. 
Of course, if that doesn’t work out, 
there is always Saudi Arabia and the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, otherwise known as OPEC, 
because, surely, begging an oil cartel 
to make a deal to increase oil produc-
tion could never go wrong. What is 
next? Buying oil from Iran, the world’s 
leading exporter of terrorism? 
This begs the question: Is this all 
that the Biden administration has to 
offer the American people in a time of 
crisis? Buy oil from corrupt dictators 
or buy a costly electric vehicle that 
you can’t afford? 
These are not the ideals on which 
America was built. Regrettably, this is 
President Biden’s America. 
f 
AID TO UKRAINE 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, as 
Vladimir Putin attempts to drape the 
Iron Curtain over Russia once again, I 
stress the importance of working to-
gether with our European allies to sup-
port Ukraine’s sovereignty and democ-
racies around the world. Make no mis-
take about it: This is the test of our 
time. 
As the co-chair of the Transatlantic 
Legislators’ Dialogue, I work closely 
with my European Co-Chair Radoslaw 
‘‘Radek’’ Sikorski. Congress and the 
European Parliament have taken steps 
to deal with this pariah Putin. 
Congress passed $13.6 billion last 
week for Ukraine, which provides sup-
port for humanitarian aid, military as-
sistance, and economic resolve. Amer-
ican allies, such as Poland and other 
European countries, are doing a great 
deal to deal with the refugee problem. 
President Biden separately provided 
an additional $800 million for Stinger 
missiles and other anti-aircraft, anti- 
armor weapons to help the valiant, 
brave Ukrainians. Members of the Eu-
ropean Parliament have also done their 
part with another $500 million in as-
sistance. 
NATO, today, is stronger than at any 
time since the Cold War. But there is 
much more work ahead of us. We must 
continue to unite the front against 
Vladimir Putin with our European al-
lies. 
As President Zelenskyy reminded us: 
The cost of freedom is not free. 
f 
UNJUST IMPRISONMENT OF JAPA-
NESE 
AMERICANS 
DURING 
WORLD WAR II 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 
several weeks ago, we witnessed a very 
unfortunate milestone, the 80th anni-
versary of the signature of an execu-
tive order by the President of the 
United 
States 
to 
incarcerate 
over 
100,000 
Japanese 
Americans 
during 
World War II. 
This was a direct violation of the 
founding principles of our country that 
say that no one should be deprived of 
their liberty without just cause. 
That is why I was so proud to see this 
body pass my bill, H.R. 6434, this week 
that would create a historic network of 
sites linked to the incarceration of 
Japanese Americans during World War 
II. 
Madam Speaker, the power of history 
is to gain perspective and learn from 
the mistakes of the past. I am in hopes 
that this network will call attention to 
this unjust imprisonment and ensure 
that this injustice never occurs in the 
United States again.

DEMOCRATS ARE BUILDING A 
BETTER AMERICA 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, Demo-
crats are building a better America for 
the people. Last year, we passed the 
American Rescue Plan that has helped 
to create 7.4 million jobs in 13 months, 
the most in U.S. history. Under the 
Biden administration, wages are up, 
jobs are up, and unemployment is 
down. 
What are Republicans doing? I don’t 
know, but I do know that two of them 
attended 
a 
white 
nationalist 
con-
ference last month. 
Let me now tell you all the actions 
that House Republican leadership took 
against these two Republican Members 
who attended and spoke at a white na-
tionalist conference last month.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
FRANCINE MAIGUE 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, Congressman VARGAS and I 
rise today to celebrate the incredible 
life of Francine Maigue and the indel-
ible mark she left on San Diego. 
Francine was an artist, an advocate, 
a journalist, a motivational speaker, 
and, as so many in San Diego knew 
her, a public servant. 
As district director in the California 
State Assembly, Francine made sure 
that San Diegans had equitable access 
to the resources they needed and de-
served. 
Even after her cancer diagnosis in 
2019, Francine kept working to serve 
our community while also becoming a 
powerful advocate for cancer research. 
Francine was a proud advocate for 
San Diego’s Filipino and Asian-Amer-
ican communities. She served as the 
president 
of 
the 
Filipino-American 
Chamber of Commerce of San Diego 
County and proudly highlighted the 
Filipino experience across the country 
and around the world. 
Last month, Francine passed away 
after her battle with cancer. 
Congressman VARGAS and I join so 
many from across San Diego in sending 
our condolences to Francine’s family, 
friends, and loved ones. May her mem-
ory be a blessing.

THOUGHTS 
ON 
PRESIDENT 
ZELENSKYY’S REMARKS TO CON-
GRESS 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I 
have been asked many times this week 
about my thoughts on the address to 
Congress by the President of Ukraine, 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
I was moved and inspired by his com-
mitment to the defense of his stricken 
nation and its besieged people. Presi-
dent Zelenskyy’s remarks reminded me 
of another time when a courageous and 
determined leader sought the aid of 
America in defense of his nation as it 
was being threatened by the armed 
might of Hitler’s Nazi forces. 
On February 9, 1941, Winston Church-
ill addressed the British Parliament 
with a speech that was broadcast by 
the BBC. Churchill spoke to Par-
liament, but he was really speaking to 
the United States, and, in particular, 
to President Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt. 
At the end of that speech, Churchill 
said this: ‘‘Put your confidence in us. 
Give us your faith and your blessing, 
and, under Providence, all will be 
well.’’ 
He concluded his message to Par-
liament and to America by saying: 
‘‘Give us the tools, and we will finish 
the job.’’ 
That is what I heard President 
Zelenskyy saying to the Congress of 
the United States. Madam Speaker, it 
is time to listen to the people who are 
face-to-face with the enemy fighting 
for their country. 
Madam Speaker, they know better what 
they need, far better than people in suits sit-
ting behind desks who are thousands of miles 
from the battlefields of Ukraine. 
We should heed their call and give them the 
tools to defend their country.

STANDING TOGETHER FOR PEACE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
as President Zelenskyy said, we are the 
leaders of peace. The President is the 
leader of world peace. 
Thank you, President Biden, for rec-
ognizing the crisis and the murder and 
pillage and slaughter of babies in 
Ukraine. 
Let us continue to stand together, 
but I am fighting as much to be able to 
solve the Ukraine crisis as I am for 
peace. 
Let me also acknowledge this past 
week the remembering of those who 
were killed in Atlanta, which exhibited 
the worst kind of Asian hate. Let us 
stand together against such hate and 
stand together for what is right. 
Let me also mention the fighters at 
the Pleasant Village senior citizen 
housing. 
They 
have 
been 
fighting 
against eviction, against disrespect, 
and against a complete altering of 
their living quarters. 
They determined that they should 
have quality-of-life housing. I am ask-
ing the new owner to stand down and 
to allow this housing project or this 
housing facility to be for seniors in 
their later lives so they can have a bet-
ter quality of life. 
I will continue to fight to ensure that 
they have a place to live that is safe 
and best for them. 
f 
BRING SUPPLY CHAINS HOME 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
from war in Europe to pandemic 
around the world to potential crisis in 
Asia, one of the lessons we are learning 
is that America should never be de-
pendent on strategic adversaries like 
China or Russia for the goods most 
critical to our economic and national 
security. 
Whether it is PPE, pharmaceutical 
ingredients, microchips, or the ad-
vanced battery technologies that will 
power the future, we must bring our 
supply chains home. 
We can do this by enacting into law 
the bipartisan supply chain resiliency 
provisions in the America COMPETES 
Act. 
This section of the bill, which I 
helped write, makes one of the biggest 
investments to spur domestic manufac-
turing in our Nation’s history. It has 
been endorsed by the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers, the United 
Steelworkers, the National Defense In-
dustry Association, and more than 20 
organizations, and the list is growing 
each day. 
I urge that any competitiveness bill 
that goes to the President for his sig-
nature include these important provi-
sions in the America COMPETES Act.

BIDEN BAILOUT RUINED 
RECOVERY ALREADY UNDERWAY 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, last Friday marked the 1-year 
anniversary of the Biden bailout bill. 
This $2 trillion package has directly 
led to worker shortages, billions in 
waste, and the worst inflation in 40 
years. 
The Biden bailout didn’t rescue our 
economy. It ruined a recovery that was 
already underway. 
Madam Speaker, $500 billion spent to 
incentivize 
business 
closures, 
lockdowns, and antiscience masking 
policies; billions wasted, misused, or 
repurposed for projects unrelated to 
the pandemic: Florida golf courses, 
checks for prisoners and Japanese citi-
zens, trees for New York, libraries in 
the President’s home State. The list 
goes on. 
And as a result, American families 
are finding it harder to put food on 
their table, clothes on their backs, and 
gasoline in their cars. 
President Biden sold the American 
people a COVID package that spent less 
than 9 percent on fighting COVID. He 
created a massive worker shortage and 
instigated the highest inflation in a 
generation. That is his legacy.

REMEMBERING DEPUTY 
DOMINIQUE ‘‘DOM’’ CALATA 
(Ms. STRICKLAND asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today as a member of the Wash-
ington State delegation to honor the 
service and sacrifice of Pierce County 
Sheriff’s Deputy Dom Calata. 
He was killed in the line of duty after 
pursuing a man wanted for second-de-
gree assault. 
I have been told that he had a tire-
less work ethic and was someone who 
went above and beyond in his commit-
ment to our community and to our Na-
tion. 
In addition to his role as a deputy, he 
was also in the National Guard and 
previously served in the U.S. Army. 
But his and his family’s commitment 
to the community doesn’t stop there. 
He was also an organ donor. It is just

one more way that he and his family 
have stepped up to support others in 
need. 
Dom is nothing short of a hero. His 
loss is a devastating blow to our com-
munity, and I am thinking of and pray-
ing for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Of-
fice and Dom’s family, friends, and 
loved ones. 
I hope all of us in this House will 
take a moment to remember Deputy 
Calata and his contributions to our 
community and to our Nation.

GOING BEYOND THE HEADLINES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to comment a little bit on 
some of the issues that have been out 
there this week, issues that are impor-
tant issues but about which, for what-
ever reason, I don’t think the public 
has been adequately informed as to 
what is going on. 
The first issue I would like to talk 
about concerns the bill yesterday re-
garding trade relations with Russia 
and an earlier bill with regard to oil 
exports from Russia, and that is an in-
credibly important provision in that 
bill that has not been discussed in the 
mainstream media, which is an amend-
ment of something called the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act. 
Today, before that bill is signed, the 
U.S. President can sanction foreign 
leaders or, I guess, pretty much any 
foreign person, certainly any foreign 
elected official, if they violated any 
human rights, and the definition of 
human rights is fairly narrowly de-
fined. 
When we think of horrible foreign 
leaders, we think of murder. We think 
of kidnapping. We think of holding peo-
ple without trial for excessive periods 
of time. And we think if somebody is 
going to be sanctioned, they should be 
responsible for those human rights 
abuses. 
In this bill, we change the definition 
of human rights to be open-ended, 
whatever the President thinks human 
rights are. Furthermore, we allow 
sanctioning of people who are indi-
rectly responsible for violating human 
rights. 
Already, the United States weighs in 
when countries try to preserve laws 
that were the laws of the United States 
not long ago, and I will say this with 
regard to two areas, the LGBTQ agenda 
and abortion. 
Already, when you talk to people 
from Eastern Europe; the Caribbean; 
the Dominican Republic, in particular; 
Central and South America, people are 
mad because the United States throws 
around its substantial economic weight 
to fight the Christian beliefs of these 
countries. 
Now, if these bills were signed to be-
come law, if the Senate does not amend 
them, the President will have a new 
tool in his toolbox if he wants to force 
other countries to adopt the views of 
abortion and the views of LGBTQ that 
are the views, quite frankly, of the left-
wing of the Democratic Party. 
The President will be able to threat-
en the parliaments or, for all I know, 
lobbyists and demonstrators in foreign 
countries by saying: You can’t get a 
visa to the United States because we 
don’t like your stand on abortion. We 
don’t like your stand on LGBTQ. 
They can take assets in the United 
States. And we are told this was some-
thing that was threatened, at least the 
visa thing was threatened, with regard 
to elected officials in the Dominican 
Republic. 
If you don’t follow the U.S. party 
line, you are not going to get a visa to 
the United States. We are going to 
take your assets in the United States, 
take your bank accounts. 
John Adams said that our Constitu-
tion was made for a moral and reli-
gious country. This is kind of going the 
opposite way. 
We hold contempt with people, reli-
gious people, and say that we are going 
to weigh in with all the gifts we have 
been given, the financial gifts we have 
been given. We are going to weigh in as 
a country and say that we are going to 
use those assets to punish foreign lead-
ers who had Christian beliefs that not 
so long ago were held by the vast ma-
jority of Americans. 
I hope the press reports on this latest 
power grab of the President. I hope the 
public wakes up and makes sure that 
when these bills come back from the 
Senate—and that is to say, bills with 
regard to trade, bills with regard to 
oil—that they do not include this 
great, increased power of the President 
to punish, quite frankly, Christian 
countries. 
I don’t think that has been ade-
quately addressed, and I think in most 
newspapers 
articles, 
it 
wasn’t 
ad-
dressed at all. 
Now, I will address something else. I 
am going to talk a little bit about in-
flation. A lot has been said about infla-
tion recently, and a lot of it focuses on 
the price of gas, but there is high infla-
tion everywhere. 
I have a very large manufacturing 
district. I tour my manufacturers all 
the time. It is not unusual to find man-
ufacturers whose costs for metals were 
up 400 or 500 percent well before there 
was an invasion of Ukraine. 
Every manufacturer I talk to tells 
me that they expect big inflation in 
the next year. Again, that was before 
the invasion. 
I want to draw your attention to the 
graph here of the M2 monetary supply, 
and you can look. We begin down 
around 1970, 1965, the amount year over 
year that the monetary supply goes up. 
It sometimes goes up 6 or 7 percent per 
year. 
Those were in the bad old days of the 
1970s and the inflation that kind of hit 
its peak during Jimmy Carter. 
It kind of went up and down, and we 
went through a lot of years in which 
inflation was relatively low histori-
cally, 1 or 2 percent. 
Then, you look in the last couple of 
years, and some of this was due to 
overspending on COVID. But, more re-
cently, we also have the American Res-
cue Plan in which apparently financial 
literates felt the way to benefit the 
economy was to have the Federal Re-
serve print as much money as it can. 
Now, look at this graph. Look at 
what an aberration we are in at this 
time where the money supply is going 
up year over year, over 35 percent. 
I mean, you don’t need to be a Ph.D. 
in economics to know what is going to 
happen. The cost of everything is going 
to go through the roof, oil being one of 
those things that is going to go 
through the roof, and the cost of food, 
the cost of any manufactured goods. 
I talk to farmers in my district. The 
cost of fertilizer, the cost of any other 
chemicals—through the roof. They are 
going to have to pass that on. 
Before you say that this inflation 
had anything to do with Ukraine, look 
at what the M2 money supply was like 
even before Ukraine. 
This is such an aberration from any-
thing else we have experienced in the 
United States, and it comes from peo-
ple who have convinced themselves 
that you can spend unlimited on any-
thing, and there is no cost to pay. 
I hope that the press in this country 
gets ahold of a graph like this and 
gives it to the American people so they 
can see where we are and why the cost 
of everything is through the roof. 
I really think the value of the dollar, 
not only in the last couple of months 
but over the next few years, is going to 
go downhill like nothing we have ever 
seen before. 
I think since we switched to the Fed-
eral Reserve system in whatever it 
was, 1916, 1917, we are now in uncharted 
territory. 
Some people say that we should 
never have paper money because Con-
gress won’t be able to risk destroying 
the value of the Nation’s currency. 
Well, it hasn’t happened until now, but 
wow. 
As amazing as it is, as horrible as 
these numbers are, the majority party 
talks about still trying to pass the 
Build Back Better bill that will make 
this go up even more rapidly. 
So, I beg the press corps to pay at-
tention to the monetary supply and 
connect the dots as to why we have 
such inflation.

ISSUES AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Now, there is an-
other issue that is going on, and I 
think to a certain extent because of 
Ukraine it has been pushed into the 
background, but it is still a vitally im-
portant issue, and that is what is going 
on at the border. Just because KAMALA 
HARRIS has been appointed the Border 
Patrol czar, and she does absolutely

March 18, 2022 
nothing as far as we can tell, and it 
doesn’t mean we should stop talking 
about this huge tragedy. 
In February, we had 165,000 encoun-
ters with the Border Patrol, up 63 per-
cent over last year. There were about 
72,000 people let into the country, and 
the figures aren’t out there, but they 
can guess that ICE let in another 19,000 
more. Of that amount, 9,000 were unac-
companied minors. 
If an unaccompanied minor shows up 
at the southern border, we don’t turn 
them back to their parents. They usu-
ally write an address on their T-shirt, 
and we send them off to their aunt or 
uncle, whoever, you know, it could be 
just a friend, whatever, and that is just 
par for the course. We pay to put the 
little child on the airplane, we pay to 
ship them somewhere; maybe not their 
parents, maybe just friends or what-
ever. If you want to talk about divided 
families or breaking up families, you 
look at the current system where every 
month 9,000 kids who are younger than 
age 18 are let in this country without 
their parents. 
I had a staffer go down there because 
we had to work late last week, but I 
will be down there next week. And 
there were some other observations I 
made as far as what it is like on the 
border. Gangs play music on the Mexi-
can side of the border as people march 
across. It is a festive atmosphere. No-
body even pretends that the United 
States cares about what is going on at 
their border. 
The drug gangs make $3 billion a 
year, we believe, transporting people 
here. The charges are between $2,000 
and $20,000 to come here because they 
run that border. 
It is not in just our Vice President 
where we have a lack of leadership. The 
California Highway Patrol can’t report 
illegals they find to ICE because of the, 
I would almost call it, treasonous be-
havior of one of our States. Increas-
ingly, we are getting people coming 
here who not only do they not speak 
Spanish, they speak an indigenous lan-
guage from southern Mexico or, more 
likely, from Central America. They are 
obviously very difficult to process, and 
you have to wonder about the wisdom 
of letting people in this country when 
nobody can speak their language. 
We are getting people from Iran, 
Iraq, and Uzbekistan, which of course 
are breeding grounds for terrorism. 
These people are paying up to $20,000 a 
head 
to 
come 
into 
this 
country. 
Doesn’t that concern anybody? 
The hotels, the airlines in Mexico ob-
viously know this is going on because 
people take airlines from, for example, 
Cancun to Mexicali. We know hotels 
south of the border are being used by 
illegal immigrants, but because it is 
becoming so common, it is built into 
the Mexican economy. 
Obviously, when we do so little to 
prevent this illegal immigration, mo-
rale from the Border Patrol is low. How 
would you like it if you are taking a 
job—and recently they have even been 
shot at—taking a dangerous job like 
that and getting as little support from 
the executive branch as you can imag-
ine? 
Actually, I did notice in the recent 
appropriations bill that passed last 
week, we are putting a lot more money 
into monitoring the Border Patrol and 
making sure they are not mistreating 
people. It is not a big concern for us ap-
parently when an illegal immigrant 
shoots at a Border Patrol agent, but we 
have to put millions of dollars more 
into the budget to make sure the Bor-
der Patrol is not breaking the law. No 
wonder the Border Patrol does not feel 
good about their situation right now. 
I will give you another example of 
the brazenness of the illegals coming 
here. Right now, migrants aren’t afraid 
to call 911 and get escorted with a ride 
to where they want to go, and we just 
taxi them in. If they are kind of wan-
dering around, let’s make a 911 call, 
and they show up. Nothing wrong with 
them, no healthcare problem, we just 
use our local emergency services as an 
escort service. 
We still have a situation in which 
people don’t have to be tested for 
COVID. Okay. But it is kind of strange 
that American citizens, say if you 
work for a hospital, are required to get 
a vaccine, and we don’t even test you if 
you are trying to come in this country. 
What are the priorities here? 
People coming in from what we call 
special-interest countries are going up, 
be it Pakistan, Yemen, Iraq, countries 
like this. 
So, in any event, I encourage the 
press, and that encourages the so- 
called conservative press, or the bal-
anced press, to report to America when 
we are having 80,000 or 90,000 people 
cross the border every month, report 
what type of people are coming here, 
report on the mass decrease in the 
number of deportations, as even people 
who have committed crimes are re-
moved at a much lower rate than they 
were by Donald Trump. Because I do 
think if we look back at America 10 
years from now and say, how did the 
policies of 2022 affect America, still the 
number one most damaging thing is 
that we ignored our border. 
I will point out one more thing about 
ignoring the border. Right now, we do 
have a crisis in Ukraine. Hopefully, we 
are not going to have a similar crisis in 
Taiwan. I have felt all along that an ef-
fect of not enforcing our border is to 
tell foreign leaders who don’t like us 
that we have kind of a wimpy, ineffec-
tive, 
incompetent 
government 
in 
charge right now. 
Other normal countries do not let 
90,000 to 100,000 people a month cross 
into their country, and leaders around 
the world look at that, and they, quite 
frankly, think that the current execu-
tive branch of this country is not a se-
rious elected official, and they chal-
lenge somebody who is not a serious 
elected official. 
There is no doubt in my mind that if 
we had been enforcing that border and 
taking a tougher stance in other places 
around the world, we wouldn’t be in 
this mess in Ukraine like we are today. 
ISSUES SURROUNDING COVID 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
the next issue that I think has dis-
appeared a little bit is with regard to 
COVID. We are now in a dip in new peo-
ple getting COVID, but I think in the 
last week we are still around 5,000 peo-
ple who died of COVID. I think the last 
four people I have known who have 
died of COVID really haven’t had a lot 
else wrong with them, maybe nothing 
else wrong with them. I think there are 
a couple of things that have been 
underreported or not focused on. 
I have railed for almost 2 years here 
now on vitamin D. There was a study 
out of Israel that was released fairly 
recently that said that if you were defi-
cient in vitamin D—and in the study 
they say deficient being 20 nanograms 
per milligram, which is pretty defi-
cient—that you would be 11 times more 
likely to die of COVID. 
Now, given all the massive amount of 
ink—if they still use ink—and the mas-
sive amount of time that has been 
spent educating the public on how to 
avoid COVID or avoid dying from 
COVID, I would think a little bit more 
time would be spent by the public 
health establishment looking at the ef-
fects of vitamin D. 
You are 11 times more likely to die if 
you are under 20 nanograms. What can 
we do about that? First of all, it ought 
to be publicized. Secondly, it should be 
par for the course that, particularly if 
you are older and you go in for a 
checkup, that your doctor gives you a 
vitamin D test. Right now, your reim-
bursement levels for that test may not 
be quite up for the cost. 
We all know that the medical estab-
lishment in America today, particu-
larly the hospitals, are obsessed with 
money. But people are dying out there. 
If you test somebody for vitamin D, 
and they are down around 15 or 17 
nanograms, you can alert that person 
and perhaps save a life. There are all 
sorts of people walking around with in-
sufficient vitamin D levels. They don’t 
even know it. They don’t know the im-
portance of it. 
I will also point out that they should 
especially point out the value of vita-
min D to people of color. We know peo-
ple of color are more likely to have low 
levels of vitamin D, and therefore the 
incompetence or the failure of the pub-
lic health establishment not to educate 
people on vitamin D has disproportion-
ately affected people of color. 
They talk about people of color a lot 
in this institution, and I think a lot of 
times they talk about prejudice that is 
not there. But here you have some-
thing in which people are dying over-
whelmingly, and for whatever reason, 
the public health establishment does 
not ring the alarm as far as how much 
darker skin increases the possibility 
that you are going to get serious 
COVID. So I beg the CDC and the pub-
lic health establishment to focus a lit-
tle bit more on vitamin D.

March 18, 2022 
I will also point out that different 
doctors have different opinions as to 
how you should treat somebody for 
COVID, and I have no problem finding 
doctors who find that drugs like 
ivermectin 
or 
hydroxychloroquine 
given early will save lives, and a lot of 
times those same doctors feel a drug 
called remdesivir is not effective. 
Now, I don’t think the subcommittee 
that we have had here has studied that 
enough. But with remdesivir, appar-
ently the hospitals—and this is largely 
the 
drug 
companies 
getting 
the 
money—you are going to get billed out 
over $3,000 a day for the treatment, and 
the treatment for ivermectin is nomi-
nal. 
I talk to doctors, smart doctors, doc-
tors that are well published, who tell 
me that they could have saved tens of 
thousands, maybe over 100,000 lives if 
doctors could give the off-label drugs 
that were originally prescribed for an-
other purpose, but the doctors aren’t 
allowed to by the hospitals that they 
work for. 
This is a potential scandal. I would 
think normally the press would be a 
little bit inquisitive when we say one 
drug is worth $3,200 a day and one drug 
is under $50 a day, and smart doctors 
feel the drug for $50 a day or under $50 
a day is more effective. But for what-
ever reason we don’t talk about it. If 
something wrong is going on around 
here, the reason they are able to get 
away with things going on is because 
the press doesn’t highlight it. 
The reason why hospitals are not giv-
ing drugs that some doctors feel are 
more effective are directives from the 
NIH. And, again, I think drug compa-
nies have too much power in this town, 
but it is something that should be 
looked into by the media. It surprises 
me that some people still aren’t aware 
of this. 
CONFLICTS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE 
Mr. GROTHMAN. The final thing 
that we will focus on here a little bit is 
what is going on in Ukraine. I still feel 
that for whatever reason, and I have 
talked about it here, we have not done 
enough to discuss the Holodomor. The 
Holodomor was the starvation of 4 mil-
lion Ukrainians in the early 1930s by 
the Communist government. 
At the time, it was underreported in 
the United States because at that time, 
for reasons unknown to me—I wasn’t 
around at the time, it is a mystery to 
me today—The New York Times is per-
ceived to be the paper of record. And 
The New York Times, a guy by the 
name of Walter Duranty decided not to 
talk about the starvation. He decided 
to keep it secret. Probably because at 
the time the intellectuals, the type of 
people who work at the big newspapers, 
liked to look upon the left favorably, 
and because it was Communists who 
were starving people, it is not some-
thing they like to talk about. 
I do not know how you can intel-
ligently talk about the relationships 
between Ukraine and Russia without 
talking about the 4 million—and that 
is the lowest, by the way, other people 
talk about 15 million—without talking 
about the 4 million Ukrainians who 
were starved to death by the Com-
munist, Marxist government that ran 
the Soviet Union at that time. 
I would again ask that our press run 
special features on the starvation that 
took place 90 years ago. First of all, 
when 4 million people are starved, it 
should be something every American 
school child knows about anyway; but 
secondly, when you look at the animos-
ity of the Ukrainians toward the Rus-
sians, that certainly plays a big role. I 
have a sneaking suspicion the reason 
we don’t talk about it is because it is 
one more embarrassment to the athe-
istic, totalitarian left that some power-
ful people in this country like to look 
up to. So again, I wish that the news-
papers would cover the Holodomor, and 
I wish that the schools would cover it 
because no school child should be able 
to graduate from high school without 
knowing about this. 
b 1145 
And it is also important so they can 
be on the lookout for big government 
atheists, wherever they are. I think 
you also have to know about what the 
big government atheists did to under-
stand why we fought in Korea, to see 
why we fought in Vietnam. 
But America’s school children, quite 
frankly, well older than school chil-
dren, are blissfully ignorant of the 
Holodomor and what can happen if you 
let a bunch of atheistic big-government 
types take over the government. 
The final thing that I am going to 
focus on here a little bit, I have before 
thanked President Biden for giving the 
State of the Union speech and not talk-
ing about racism. But I still think one 
of the problems we have with high 
crime in this country—and my district 
borders the city of Milwaukee. The city 
of Milwaukee, for the second time last 
year, had the highest murder rate they 
have ever had. 
When I was a child, the city of Mil-
waukee was the safest of the 25 biggest 
cities in the country. But we have gone 
downhill. And I think a lot of that is 
the police have been beat up; they are 
called racists, and they are afraid to do 
their job. They are afraid of having a 
complaint filed against them. We still 
have a bill floating around Congress 
saying it should be easier to sue police. 
And, as a result, we do get these high 
murder rates. 
In addition to the high murder rates, 
we have, together with our lax policy 
at the border, 100,000 people dying 
every year from drug overdoses. But, 
again, it was 45,000 7 years ago. That 
was high. And I think whether it is 
45,000 or 100,000, people’s eyes glaze 
over. If it was your child, if it was your 
sibling who died of a drug overdose, 
maybe your eyes wouldn’t glaze over. 
But the media in this country, their 
eyes have glazed over, and we continue 
to let people die. 
So, in conclusion, in any event, my 
final ask here is that President Biden, 
who has done what he can to fan the 
flames of saying police are racist, po-
lice are racist, I think it would do a lot 
toward making it easier to hire police 
around the country and easier to be an 
effective policeman if he would pub-
licly apologize to the police of this 
country for his slandering them and his 
compatriots slandering them, and tell 
them what a good job they are doing. 
So those are some of the issues that 
I hoped the press would pick up on. 
In conclusion, I will make one more 
comment with regard to Ukraine. This 
is a disaster for Ukraine. It is just a 
horrible thing. We all feel so good 
about how brave they are; about the 
fight they have put up. 
Eventually, that war has got to end, 
and I never feel, when I am dealing 
with members of this administration, 
or Congress, in general, quite frankly, 
that there is enough focus on ending 
the war. 
There are newspaper reports saying 
that Israel might be getting involved 
in trying to negotiate an end. But the 
United States is still the most impor-
tant powerful country in the world. 
And I wish the administration would 
take a little bit more time negotiating, 
trying to negotiate an end to that con-
flict. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
DEMOCRATS ARE DELIVERING 
FOR AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. SOTO) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, the Re-
publicans lost the majority and the 
Presidency because of their incom-
petence on COVID and the economy, 
and passed a tax cut for the rich that 
exploded the deficit by $400 billion, and 
the debt by $4 trillion. 
So forgive me if I won’t stand here 
and be lectured about fiscal responsi-
bility from folks who took their only 
moment in charge to give windfalls to 
the wealthiest Americans, and now 
they are desperate to paint a sad pic-
ture of America. They are invested in 
our Nation’s failure, solely as a des-
perate move to try to get back to 
power. 
Meanwhile, we Democrats are deliv-
ering. First, we defended democracy. I 
was up there in the Chamber on Janu-
ary 6 when a violent insurrection at-
tempted to stop the democratic, peace-
ful transfer of power. This violent in-
surrection was stoked by my Repub-
lican colleagues. They don’t want to 
talk about that now. But that’s too 
bad. 
They attacked our democracy. They 
desecrated this Chamber by stoking ex-
tremism. Yet, we got back here and 
they voted ‘‘no’’ and we voted ‘‘yes’’ to 
make sure that American voters were 
heard and certified Joe Biden’s election

March 18, 2022 
as President. And yes, some brave Re-
publicans joined us because they real-
ized it was treason. 
We will defend democracy and hold 
those responsible accountable through 
the January 6 committee. 
Second, we got the pandemic under 
control. We passed the American Res-
cue Plan, put shots in arms, money in 
pockets, got kids back to school and 
families back to work. Every American 
had access to the vaccine; every Amer-
ican, and life is getting back to nor-
mal. 
We stopped a great recession back in 
Florida, where we both have the honor 
of representing. We stopped a fore-
closure crisis that knocked in half peo-
ple’s wealth, hurt through the genera-
tions, so many homeowners in Florida 
and across the Nation. 
Unemployment is down to 4 percent 
nationally and under 4 percent in Flor-
ida. Yet, no Republicans voted for it. 
Third, we passed the largest infra-
structure law in our Nation’s history. 
The infrastructure plan will upgrade 
America, roads and bridges, clean air 
and water, airports and ports, high 
speed internet access for all Ameri-
cans, including rural Americans left 
behind before, and brownfield restora-
tion and other environmental restora-
tion. Ten Republicans voted for it. We 
applaud them. But they were ridiculed 
by their own party for voting for infra-
structure. 
What is wrong with the minority 
leaders in this Chamber if they are 
going to attack their own Members for 
investing in America, something that 
they had the chance to do? I would 
have voted for it under then-President 
Trump for an infrastructure package. 
But they failed to do it. We got it done. 
Then Democrats led this House to 
pass a bipartisan National Defense Au-
thorization Act. That is to protect the 
homeland, fund our military, support 
our troops. 
We passed a bipartisan budget just 
last week to meet the needs of the 
American people, jobs, healthcare, edu-
cation, 
the 
environment, 
local 
projects; yes, supporting a robust im-
migration system, and making sure 
that we can meet all the needs of the 
American people. 
We also had bipartisan support for 
the war on Ukraine, the relentless and 
disgraceful 
invasion 
by 
Russia 
of 
Ukraine. We have supplied them with 
military weapons, training, humani-
tarian relief, and we will defend democ-
racy in Europe with that $14 billion we 
passed in a bipartisan fashion here. 
And yes, we need to still continue to 
address COVID-related inflation. First, 
by getting COVID–19 under control, our 
economy is finally producing more 
goods again. Things are more efficient 
now. People are buying more services 
again to balance that out. 
Second, our infrastructure law will 
upgrade our ports, our airports, and 
our 
highways 
to 
improve 
supply 
chains. 
Third, 
we 
are 
addressing 
price 
gouging of companies that are taking 
advantage, particularly in gas and gro-
ceries. 
Fourth, we are boosting domestic oil 
production to compensate for the Rus-
sian oil ban which was very popular 
and demanded upon by my constituents 
and others. And in the long term, we 
are investing in renewable energy. And 
yes, the Federal Reserve will do their 
part to help make sure we can address 
COVID-related and Ukraine war-re-
lated inflation, and we need to do this 
together, rather than politicize it. 
Next, we are turning the corner to go 
to 
the 
America 
COMPETES 
Act, 
Madam Speaker, bringing American 
manufacturing jobs back home, some-
thing that people have talked about for 
years. We will get this done. We have 
had bipartisan support in the Senate. 
We had some bipartisan support in the 
House. We will now go to conference. 
And what will that mean? Bringing 
back home more microchip manufac-
turing, which has made it harder to get 
cars and trucks on to American car 
lots. We can make it here at home. We 
can make it in America. 
We will bring back personal protec-
tive equipment and other healthcare 
manufacturing to help out, like we saw 
during the pandemic, where it was a 
huge issue. 
We will bring back telecommuni-
cations equipment. We invent tele-
communications equipment, but so 
much of it, all of it, is made overseas. 
And with China now spying on us, we 
need to make sure we have our domes-
tic production ready to go. 
And pharmaceutical production, bio-
similar production, aerospace produc-
tion, like we do in East Orange County, 
as well as space production; having the 
busiest spaceport in the world, 70 per-
cent of space flights going through 
there at Cape Canaveral, something 
that we beam with pride about in Flor-
ida. 
So as we hear about the mistakes of 
the past and trying to invest in failure 
by many Republicans in this Chamber, 
the Democratic majority is defending 
democracy. We have gotten COVID 
under control. We have passed a major 
infrastructure package. We have passed 
bipartisan bills for the budget, for our 
military, for the war in Ukraine. And 
now, we go on next to bring American 
jobs home with the America COM-
PETES Act. The future is bright if we 
work together, Madam Speaker. 
HONORING ASHLEE MAREE WRIGHT 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Women’s History Month, I would 
like to recognize Ashley Maree Wright. 
Ashlee Maree Wright is a mother, dy-
namic visionary, and results-oriented 
leader. She founded Wright on Time 
Educational Services in 2006, which 
provides customized educational solu-
tions to communities that desire to 
open a school, solve an educational 
problem, or require management serv-
ices. WOT focuses on developing inno-
vative learning environments that cul-
tivate the entire student in a way that 
empowers them to be impactful leaders

fully 
implemented 
a 
unique 
edu-
cational model that provides an inno-
vative and nurturing educational expe-
rience, which is available to all stu-
dents in central Florida. 
Thousands of students who were once 
unsuccessful in a traditional public 
school model are now thriving, grad-
uating from high school, and pursuing 
postgraduate opportunities due to Ash-
ley’s unparalleled work. 
Before her role as founder of NBHS, 
Ashlee established herself as an edu-
cational professional by being an ex-
ceptional 
teacher 
and 
ultimately 
climbing the career ladder to become a 
principal at the age of 25. As a result of 
her modus operandi, she is widely ac-
claimed as a business leader who genu-
inely cares about the growth of each 
child. 
Her ability to effectively raise stu-
dents’ academic prowess and self-es-
teem helps bolster their performance 
amidst any present challenges they 
may have. Today, she builds and oper-
ates schools utilizing her education 
ethos to replicate her success. 
Ms. Wright graduated from Florida 
State University in 2003, gave birth to 
the beautiful and precocious Victoria 
Maree in 2007, and started her own 
charter system in 2010. Her passion, up-
bringing, and love for empowering oth-
ers through education laid the frame-
work for her unique education and 
management methodology. 
Building on her parents’ legacy, 
award-winning educators Dr. Clint and 
Debra Wright, Ashlee continues to 
shift 
the 
education 
paradigm 
and 
change lives for the better, one com-
munity at a time. 
For this and more, Ashlee Maree

nament.

tices that plague them. Most recently, 
she has begun to help address the issue 
of inaccessibility to feminine hygiene 
products by providing these products 
to local Title I schools. 
Ms. Patel’s Bridge the Gap initiatives 
in Osceola County are inspired by her

Deputy Chief Holland’s first thoughts 
of a law enforcement career surfaced at 
15. Her best friend’s dad was a retired 
deputy sheriff, which sparked her in-
terest in law enforcement. This inter-
est quickly developed into a passion, 
and when she graduated from high 
school, she immediately accepted a po-
sition at the Polk County Sheriff’s Of-
fice. 
Deputy Chief Betty Holland’s career 
goals include becoming chief of police 
with the Kissimmee Police Department

ing public servants to higher standards 
and expectations; and creating more 
open lines of communication between 
officers and civilians. Her actions re-
garding these objectives remain a con-
sistent measure of her interests in the 
betterment of the field of law enforce-
ment. 
For this and more, Deputy Chief 
Betty Holland, we honor you.

HONORING LAUDI CAMPO 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Women’s History Month, I recognize 
Laudi Campo. 
Laudi Campo was born and raised in 
Morovis, Puerto Rico. Through a 25- 
year professional trajectory in commu-
nications, government, and nonprofits, 
she continues to build organizations, 
create partnerships, and implement in-
novative outreach and services for the 
community. 
Her career started in the Puerto Rico 
Senate as a communications specialist. 
She then became an English teacher 
and later gained valuable experience in 
Federal grant management in the pri-
vate sector. As a public relations direc-
tor for Vega Alta, her most notable 
contribution became a radio program 
to connect the community with the 
local government. 
In 2011, she moved with her family to 
Orlando, where she has been a note-
worthy player in Hispanic relations in 
central Florida. As a Spanish-language 
teacher, she acquired valuable insight 
into the education system. Her passion 
for community work reignited at the 
Orange County Property Appraiser and 
the city of Orlando’s District 2 office, a 
sector rich in diversity and community 
pride, where she helped people of dif-
ferent nationalities. 
One of the most significant achieve-
ments became her work on the Trust 
Act policy, which was approved unani-
mously by the Orlando City Council 
and helps noncitizens who are victims 
of crime. 
In 2019, Laudi was named deputy di-
rector for the Hispanic Federation 
Florida, the Nation’s premier Latino 
nonprofit. She directed the Census, 
voter 
registration, 
and 
COVID–19 
media campaigns during the pandemic. 
In 2021, she became HF Florida’s State 
director. She expanded services and 
spearheaded a massive effort to vac-
cinate 13,000 individuals and educate 
more than 1 million Floridians on vac-
cines. She foresaw a pandemic after-
shock and provided $1 million in finan-
cial aid to local nonprofits. 
Laudi continues to forge partnerships 
and advocate for affordable housing, 
immigration, environmental justice, 
and fair redistricting. Most recently, 
she has been recognized by the 2021 
Tech Innovadores for her work in dig-
ital inclusion. 
For this and more, Senora Laudi 
Campo, we honor you. 
HONORING SARAH JOHNSTON 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Women’s History Month, I recognize 
Sarah Johnston. 
Sarah Johnston serves as the vice 
president of development of the Boys 
and Girls Club of Central Florida. She 
began her career in the development 
field in 2002 after graduating from the 
University of Central Florida. Her goal 
has always been to obtain a leadership 
position that utilizes and challenges 
her abilities to maximize results, build 
strong relationships, and honor her 
commitment to excellence, innovation, 
and community. 
Sarah is a mission-driven profes-
sional with over 20 years of experience 
in building and sustaining excellent in-
vestor relationships with a measurable 
track record of success. Through her 
experience, she has demonstrated ex-
pertise in creating philanthropic cul-
tures by utilizing a strategic, collabo-
rative, data-driven, and results-ori-
ented mindset. In her eyes, her team’s 
responsibility is to serve as a con-
nector for individuals in the commu-
nity and their passion for investing in 
the future of children of promise. 
Sarah’s favorite part of her role is 
building bridges with investors and 
sharing the potential impact they can 
have through the stories of club mem-
bers she serves. She believes there is 
nothing more important than telling a 
child you believe in them and that re-
gardless of their ZIP Code or the eco-
nomic status of their family, they de-
serve a chance to realize their dreams. 
In her service to the community, 
Sarah raised over $25 million in hope 
and opportunity. Ultimately, she is 
driven every day by the bravery of the 
club members she serves who face and 
have overcome unimaginable obstacles, 
as well as the success they achieved 
through mentors and club program-
ming. For her, being able to watch a 
club member be the first in their fam-
ily to walk across a stage to receive a 
high school diploma, and seeing the 
pride light up in their eyes, keeps her 
believing that every day is an oppor-
tunity to be great. 
For this and more, Ms. Sarah John-
ston, we honor you.

In honor of Women’s History Month, 
I would like to recognize Yulonda Bell. 
Ms. Yulonda Bell serves as the asso-
ciate dean for the student services at 
Polk State College where she listens 
to, learns from, and encourages people 
from all walks of life to achieve their 
dreams. Bell is a strong leader who 
does not seek the spotlight and prefers 
to work in the background providing 
guidance and support that fosters stu-
dent success. 
Born and raised in Bartow, Florida, 
Bell was a teen parent who overcame 
obstacles to achieve her diploma and 
provide for her family. Her persever-
ance resulted in her achievement of an 
associate degree from Polk Community 
College, a bachelor’s degree from War-
ner University, and a master’s degrees 
from Webster University, all while 
raising two sons. 
She first served Polk County Public 
Schools, followed by positions with the 
Florida Department of Children and 
Families, and finally Polk State Col-
lege. She was the first in her family to 
achieve a college diploma, providing 
her with an understanding of the chal-
lenges that students of color and first- 
generation-in-college students face as 
they navigate higher education. 
She is a leader on campus serving as 
an advisor to the Black Student Union; 
a founder of SISTERS, Strong, Inde-
pendent, Sisters, that Encourage, RE-
SPECT and Survive; a mentor for Polk 
State basketball; and the STEM Club

She invests time as a member of the 
organizing committee for the city of 
Winter Haven Juneteenth Celebration, 
serving on the city of Winter Haven’s 
Martin Luther King committee, volun-
teering at the Neighborhood Service 
Center, and participating in Lift Lake-
land to improve race relations and ex-

HONORING CARL T. BAKER FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
J. 
WALTER 
JUCKETT COMMUNITY SERVICE 
AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Carl T. Baker for receiving 
the 33rd Annual J. Walter Juckett Community 
Service Award from the Adirondack Regional 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Mr. Baker was born in Gloversville, New 
York, in 1951. He received a Bachelor of Arts 
Degree from Cornell University in 1973 and 
earned his Juris Doctorate Degree from Al-
bany Law School in 1978. The following year, 
he was admitted to the New York State Bar. 
Mr. Baker then planted his roots in Glens 
Falls, where he went on to become a founding 
shareholder of Fitzgerald Morris Baker Firth 
P.C., a renowned legal practice that serves cli-
ents throughout the state to this day with attor-
neys specializing in nearly every major dis-
cipline of law. 
Mr. Baker has written several publications in 
the legal field and has lectured for the New 
York State Bar Association Continuing Legal 
Education program. In 2015, he was elected 
to the American College of Trusts and Estates 
Counsel and has been recognized with sev-
eral law awards. In addition to his honorable 
career as an attorney, Mr. Baker has an illus-
trious record serving on the boards and com-
mittees of several reputable community orga-
nizations and charitable groups, including the 
Glens Falls Kiwanis Foundation, Board of 
Governors of Glens Falls Hospital, Planned 
Giving Council of Glens Falls Hospital, Wid-
owed Persons Service of Greater Glens Falls 
Area, and several others. 
Carl T. Baker has led a life devoted to serv-
ice, charity, and leadership. It is clear why 
Baker was chosen as the recipient of the pres-
tigious J. Walter Juckett Community Service 
Award by the Adirondack Regional Chamber 
of Commerce. This award is the chamber’s 
most distinguished for community service and 
is named in honor of J. Walter Juckett, a re-
markable businessman and civic leader. On 
behalf of New York’s 21st District, I would like 
to congratulate Carl on this honor and thank 
him for his years of service in the North Coun-
try.

RECOGNIZING ARDEN JOHNSON 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize Arden Johnson who has retired as 
Ellery Town Supervisor after serving fifty 
years. 
Town Supervisor Johnson, who recently 
celebrated his ninetieth birthday, is believed to 
be the oldest and longest tenured Supervisor 
in the State of New York. His passion for serv-
ice and zest for the community has truly bene-
fitted the region, impacting thousands of lives 
throughout his long career in public service. 
In 1948, before graduating from high school, 
Arden began the Young Republican Club in 
the Town of Portland. He graduated from 
Brocton Central School in 1949 and was com-
mitted to spending his life helping others. 
Shortly 
after 
graduating, 
he 
served 
as 
Brocton’s Fire Chief from 1955 through 1957 
and was later elected to the Brocton Village 
Board, where he served from 1957 through 
1960. 
In 1964, Arden moved to the Town of Ellery 
and it did not take long for him to get involved. 
From Little League and Babe Ruth baseball to 
youth recreation programs, Arden was always 
active in the community. He also helped found 
the midget football program in Ellery which re-
mains very popular to this day. 
In 1972, Arden was elected Ellery Town Su-
pervisor and fifty years later, in 2022, we cele-
brate his retirement. Over his fifty years in of-
fice, Arden made significant contributions to 
the community and was a strong leader. In ad-
dition to his time as Supervisor, Arden served 
on the County Legislature from 1980 to 1983. 
His most beloved contribution to the town was 
the Ellery Town Park. Boasting twenty acres 
of land, the park includes nearly a mile-long 
walking trail, tennis, baseball and soccer 
fields, pavilions, a playground and more. Also, 
home to a Veteran’s Memorial, dedicated on 
May 30, 2005, the Ellery Town Park is appre-
ciated by the greater community and all who 
visit. 
Supervisor Arden Johnson worked tirelessly 
for his constituents. He is a proud family man, 
friend, mentor, and more. His leadership and 
service to our community has touched the 
lives of many and will be cherished for gen-
erations to come. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me in 
recognizing Ellery Town Supervisor, Arden 
Johnson, on his longstanding service and wish 
him the best in his retirement. Congratulations 
on this tremendous milestone, and I thank him 
for his lifelong commitment to our community.

HONORING CHIEF RICHARD HOW-
ELL 
OF 
FAYETTEVILLE, 
TEN-
NESSEE 
HON. SCOTT DesJARLAIS 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, to honor Chief Richard Howell for 32 
years of dedicated service to the City of Fay-
etteville, located in Tennessee’s Fourth Con-
gressional District. 
Chief Howell joined the Fayetteville Police 
Department in January of 1990. He graduated 
from the Tennessee Law Enforcement Train-
ing Academy on April 27, 1990. During his 
long and successful career, Chief Howell 
steadily rose in rank, receiving a series of pro-
motions beginning in 1997, when he was 
named Sergeant, becoming a Lieutenant in 
2003, and then a Commander in 2004. The 
Board of Mayor and Alderman recognized the 
quality of his work and endorsed his promotion 
to Fayetteville Police Chief on July 1, 2013. 
Chief Howell held this position until his well- 
earned retirement this month. 
Chief Howell achieved multiple certifications/ 
specializations during his career that included 
certified armorer, certified arms instructor, spe-
cialized training in homicide investigations, 
hazardous materials technician and team op-
erations, chemical weapons instructor, and 
Training Officer. He was the founder and the 
first Team Commander of the Special Oper-
ations Response Team (SORT) established in 
2001. Chief Howell developed an active shoot-
er program through SORT that would help 
train his team members and other depart-
ments on active shooter situations. Chief How-
ell performed the project management over-
sight, in coordination with the Fayetteville 
Board of Mayor and Alderman, of the con-
struction of the current Police Headquarters. 
Chief Howell is a graduate of the Leader-
ship Lincoln Class of 2003, attended the 
Huntsville Police Academy for Critical Deploy-
ment of Patrol Officers, attended the Ten-
nessee Law Enforcement Development Sem-
inar, and attended the Regional Counterdrug 
Training Academy. In addition to his work as 
a member of SORT, Chief Howell was also a 
member of the Tennessee Law Enforcement 
Training Officer Association, the TN Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police, and FBI Law Enforce-
ment Executive Development Association. 
A devoted family man, Chief Howell enjoys 
spending time with his wife Suzanne and 
daughters Kaitlyn and Jessica. His decades of 
dedication to the citizens of Fayetteville and 
Lincoln County, Tennessee are truly appre-
ciated. I am proud to represent a community 
that has the utmost respect for all the men 
and women who serve our communities as 
members of law enforcement. Chief Howell’s 
professional demeanor and management skills 
were well respected and have established a 
standard for service to community. I ask all 
Members of Congress to join me in congratu-
lating Richard Howell for a job well done and 
sending well wishes for a happy and healthy 
retirement.

tended the San Antonio College after he grad-
uated from Jefferson in 1941 until he enlisted 
in the Navy in October of 1942. Due to his col-
lege credits already earned, he was entered 
into an officer training program. He was com-
missioned an Ensign in May of 1944. He pro-
ceeded to be part of the commissioning crew 
of LST 781. LST 781 then sailed from New 
Orleans, LA through the Panama Canal and 
into the South Pacific Theater. His ship partici-
pated in many of the island invasions in the 
Pacific culminating in the invasion of Okinawa 
where he survived kamikaze attacks while 
supporting Marine Corp Air Unit logistics. His 
ship had the distinction of being one of the 
first American ships to enter a Japanese port 
after the Atomic Bombs ended the conflict. He 
used a jeep from his ship to drive the short 
distance to Hiroshima to see the destruction 
there since no one knew anything about the 
danger of radiation. It was a sight he could 
never forget. 
He returned after the war to San Antonio 
and completed his undergraduate degree in 
marketing at St. Mary’s University. He was 
working for General Motors when he met the 
love of his life, Frances Salley of Alice, Texas. 
They married in January of 1950. When they 
returned from their honeymoon, he was greet-
ed by a letter from the United States Navy 
calling him back to active duty for the Korean 
conflict. After Korea, he and Frances returned 
to South Texas where they raised two sons, 
Robert W Pratt II and Byron Wayne Pratt. 
Robert had careers as an executive for 
Central Power & Light Company and later as 
a real estate developer of apartment commu-
nities. He stayed in the Navy Reserves retiring 
with the rank of Commander. He was an ac-
tive member of the Corpus Christi Yacht Club 
for many years. 
Robert and Frances enjoyed a 71+ year 
partnership and adventure together. Many of 
their best times were spent with family and 
friends aboard their 50-foot ketch, the Mas-
querade, on voyages that went from Florida to 
Annapolis, Maryland, and throughout the Car-
ibbean. They moved from Corpus Christi, 
Texas to Fair Oaks Ranch, Texas in 1995 
where RW continued to manage some of his 
real estate assets and mentor younger people 
he met to grow to their full potential. 
We are able to live free today because of 
the courage of men like Commander Pratt, 
who put their lives on hold and answered their 
country’s call when it needed them most. Love 
of family, country, and a life dedicated to serv-
ice sum up the character of Commander Pratt, 
a member of the Greatest Generation. These 
stories will inspire future generations of Ameri-
cans to pursue a life dedicated to causes 
greater than themselves. I hope this testament 
to Commander Pratt’s life serves as an ac-
knowledgment of the immeasurable debt of 
gratitude owed to him by the American people. 
On behalf of Texas’ 21st Congressional Dis-
trict, I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the extraordinary life of Commander 
Pratt and his dedicated service to our country. 
Today, a grateful Nation thanks him. 
RECOGNIZING 
GOOD 
NEIGHBORS 
SHOPPE IN LENOIR CITY, TEN-
NESSEE FOR 20 YEARS OF CHAR-
ITABLE 
SERVICE 
IN 
THE 
LOUDON COUNTY COMMUNITY 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of Good Neighbors Shoppe, a 
charitable organization that is celebrating 20 
years of service in Loudon County, Ten-
nessee. 
Roberta and Eugene Burwell opened Good 
Neighbors Shoppe on March 19, 2002, at 109 
East Broadway Street in Lenoir City, Ten-
nessee. Their mission was to financially sup-
port other charities in the area using the pro-
ceeds from selling donated goods at their 
store. After early success, Good Neighbors 
Shoppe built a new, larger headquarters at 
420 Leeper Parkway in Lenior City, where it is 
located today. 
Good Neighbors Shoppe has donated over 
$5 million since 2002, and at least 80 percent 
of each year’s sales income is donated to 
charities within the Loudon County community. 
Domestic and sexual abuse centers for adults 
and children, food pantries, veterans’ organi-
zations, literacy programs, youth development 
groups, disabled and senior citizen programs, 
and addiction recovery centers are among the 
many organizations benefitting from Good 
Neighbors Shoppe’s contributions. Addition-
ally, Good Neighbors Shoppe has subsidized 
over 35 academic scholarships to Loudon 
County students and distributed annual grants 
to all Loudon County public schools. 
Behind Good Neighbors Shoppe’s success 
is a team of over 220 unpaid volunteers. 
These volunteers screen donated merchan-
dise, professionally display the items that are 
for sale, and operate the storefront. Gently 
used and new items available for sale at Good 
Neighbors Shoppe include women’s, men’s 
and children’s clothing, kitchen wares, fur-
niture, and other useful items. 
It is my honor to recognize the philanthropic 
efforts of Good Neighbors Shoppe in the 
United State House of Representatives. Con-
gratulations to every Good Neighbors Shoppe 
volunteer, past and present, on 20 years of 
outstanding service to East Tennessee com-
munities.

HONORING 
THE 
PLATTSBURGH 
DISTRICT 
NO. 
3 
VOLUNTEER 
FIRE DEPARTMENT ON THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
ITS 
FOUND-
ING. 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the Plattsburgh 
District No. 3 Fire Department on the 50th an-
niversary of its founding. This fire department 
has shown tremendous dedication to pro-
tecting and serving the city of Plattsburgh and 
the surrounding municipalities in Clinton Coun-
ty. 
The District No. 3 Fire Department was first 
authorized in a resolution passed by the Town 
Board of Plattsburgh on July 1, 1971 and was 
formally chartered two months later. Under the 
leadership of their first Chief, Ken Dumas, the 
twenty-five original firefighters of District No. 3 
steadily began to establish themselves within 
the Plattsburgh community. Shortly after the 
Department’s creation, local resident Kathryn 
Grube generously donated her private land on 
Wallace Hill Road to serve as their first per-
manent fire station. Despite many updates and 
renovations, the Wallace Hill Station is still the 
main home of District No. 3. 
As the years went on, the Department con-
tinued to emerge from its humble beginnings, 
gaining more experience and acquiring better 
equipment. In 1972, they purchased two one- 
thousand gallon per minute fire pumps, and 
they were officially integrated into the Clinton 
County Firemen’s Association the following 
year. 
In 
1983, 
they 
acquired 
a 
Mack 
Aerialscope fire engine from the City of New 
York and were further enhanced by a con-
sistent flow of community donations. 
Today, the District No. 3 Fire Department 
has expanded to over forty volunteer members 
who are extraordinary examples of those will-
ing to sacrifice for the good of their commu-
nity. Now utilizing an impressive fleet of five 
modern engines, the District No. 3 Fire De-
partment responds to over one hundred calls 
annually. On April 9, 2022, the Department will 
celebrate its seven remaining founding mem-
bers: Dennis Burnell, Wendell Burnell, George 
Giroux, Marcel Giroux, Gary Gudz, Edward 
Goslow, and Roger Harwood. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st Congressional District, I am 
honored to recognize the 50th anniversary of 
Plattsburgh’s No. 3 Fire Department.

HONORING MR. MOE AMMAR 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the retirement of Mr. Moe Ammar 
from Pacific Grove’s Chamber of Commerce 
after 29 years of dedicated service to Mon-
terey County and the central coast of Cali-
fornia. Mr. Ammar’s legacy of leadership and 
financial stewardship will continue to guide Pa-
cific Grove’s strong and vibrant Chamber of 
Commerce and business community. 
Born in Beirut, Lebanon, Mr. Ammar quickly 
rose through the ranks of the hospitality indus-
try after graduating from the University of Ne-
vada, Las Vegas in 1979. After developing ho-
tels around the world, his work brought him to 
Pacific Grove in 1986 and Mr. Ammar quickly 
embraced our community and became the 
champion of Pacific Grove’s businesses at the 
local and state level. He passionately fought 
against increased taxes, parking charges, and 
zoning laws that limit business growth. 
Under his leadership and presidency, the 
Chamber passed four ballot measures in sup-
port of local business priorities. In 2001, the 
Downtown Business Improvement District was 
formed by the Chamber which benefits 230 
businesses. In 2007, the Chamber helped 
form the Hospitality Improvement District that 
represents and benefits 23 lodging establish-
ments, and in 2013, it established the Tourist 
Information Center.

Furthermore, events like ‘‘Good Old Days’’ 
grew from two city blocks to nine, and the Pa-
cific Grove Car Auction was introduced at the 
Pacific Grove Golf Links. The organization 
also adopted the Holman Highway, volun-
teering to pick up trash and keep the roadway 
clean for the past 11 years. 
Mr. Moe Ammar’s dedication to the commu-
nity did not stop with the Chamber of Com-
merce. He served on the Economic Develop-
ment Committee for 27 years, taught the next 
generation of business leaders at Monterey 
Peninsula College for 17 years, and volun-
teered for picnics, parades, and the AT&T 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. His enthu-
siasm for service was commemorated when 
he was awarded the Key to the City of Pacific 
Grove in 2000, becoming only the third person 
in the last four decade to be awarded this 
honor. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Ammar’s decades of service. I ex-
tend my personal appreciation to Mr. Moe 
Ammar and his dedication to the Central 
Coast.

RECOGNIZING MS. LILLIE 
MARSHALL 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Ms. Lillie Marshall who has dedi-
cated much of her life in service to her Red 
Hook, Brooklyn, NY community. She was born 
on April 24, 1943, in Sparta, Georgia, to a 
family of community leaders in education, law 
and business. Five years out of Hancock Cen-
tral High School, she moved to Red Hook, 
Brooklyn. 
As a proud single mother of four, Ms. Lillie 
Marshall became known for her no-nonsense 
approach and commitment to the area chil-
dren. She advocated for and arranged after- 
school programs for youth of all ages. When 
a private school was built in the neighborhood, 
she served on a committee that successfully 
secured annual scholarships for qualifying chil-
dren of Red Hook public housing. She has 
watched over generations of families for dec-
ades. 
Ms. Marshall fervently advocated for tenants 
in her twenty-year role as the Tenant Associa-
tion President of Red Hook West. She met 
with NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA) execu-
tive and local leadership alike to give tenant 
perspectives and amplify their voices. Ms. 
Marshall also served on NYCHA’s Citywide 
Council of Presidents as District Chair of 
Brooklyn South. 
Ms. Marshall’s efforts will long be remem-
bered for her Thanksgiving turkey drives for 
local families, feeding the homeless, delivering 
meals and PPE to homebound seniors during 
the COVID–19 Pandemic. She has been a 
leader at events such as Red Hook Old Tim-
ers Day, National Night Out Against Crime 
and has organized Red Hook Family Day 
every year. 
For her decades of leadership and vol-
unteerism, Ms. Lillie Marshall will not soon be 
forgotten by her beloved Red Hook. Her leg-
acy of life-long community service has instilled 
core values and civic pride in her community.

IN RECOGNITION OF 
COMMUNICARE HEALTH CENTERS 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with de-
light that I rise to honor the 50th anniversary 
of 
CommuniCare 
Health 
Centers. 
CommuniCare Health Centers is a Federal 
Qualified Health Center that continues to 
serve residents in West Sacramento and sur-
rounding neighborhoods in Yolo County. 
In 1994, the name ‘‘CommuniCare Health 
Centers’’ was adopted to describe this growing 
family of health centers. Today, CommuniCare 
Health Centers include the Davis Community 
Clinic, Hansen Family Health Center in Wood-
land, Salud Clinic in West Sacramento, and 
five satellite locations. In 2007, CommuniCare 
Health Centers became a Federally Qualified 
Health Center, and in 2014, they achieved 
recognition for quality as a Level Three Pa-
tient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), the 
highest level of recognition by the National 
Committee for Quality Assurance. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today 
we 
honor 
CommuniCare Health Center for their long- 
lasting commitment to providing quality, acces-
sible health care for the Yolo County region as 
they continue to be the backbone of the 
healthcare systems for all those in need.

HONORING THE HEROIC LIFE AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
KENNETH 
J. 
MCLAUGHLIN 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the commendable life of Army 
veteran, policeman, correctional officer, volun-
teer firefighter, and village justice, Kenneth J. 
McLaughlin. 
Mr. McLaughlin was born in 1948 and grew 
up in Saranac Lake, New York, where he 
graduated from Pius X Central High School in 
1966. He joined the Army at the age of nine-
teen and was stationed in Europe, where he 
served honorably for two years as an infantry-
man and mechanic. When he returned to the 
United States, he earned a degree in Criminal 
Justice from North Country Community Col-
lege. Kenneth became a patrolman for the 
Saranac Lake Police Department in 1970, 
where he would serve and protect his home-
town for nearly twenty-five years. In addition to 
serving his community as a parttime police of-
ficer, Kenneth supplemented his career by be-
coming a New York State Corrections Officer. 
After retiring, he was elected in 2010 as Vil-
lage Judge of Harrietstown, a role in which he 
was extremely successful in and praised by 
nearly the entire community. 
Kenneth was also a proud member of the 
Saranac Lake Volunteer Fire Department, 
where he rose through the ranks and held 
several 
important 
leadership 
positions. 
Throughout his career, Kenneth was recog-
nized for saving the lives of three Saranac 
Lake residents at the risk of his own safety. In 
2015, at the age of sixty-seven and after near-
ly fifty years on the job, he still responded to 
more calls than any other member of the De-
partment. He would remain an active fire-
fighter for the rest of his life, helping train and 
mentor the next generation of local heroes. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I am 
honored to recognize Kenneth J. McLaughlin’s 
extraordinary life of brave and selfless service 
to his country and community. It is my hope 
that his heroism, integrity, and commitment to 
public service will be carried on by those who 
knew and loved him.

HONORING VIETNAM VETERANS 
OF AMERICA CHAPTER 1032 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Chapter 1032 of the Vietnam 
Veterans of America, based in York, Pennsyl-
vania. We are forever indebted to the veteran 
members of Chapter 1032 and the millions of 
other Vietnam Veterans who selflessly served 
our nation in the armed forces. We must also 
remember, honor, and give thanks for the 
service of those servicemembers who never 
returned home and made the ultimate sacrifice 
in service to their country. Recognizing the 
sacrifices of all those who served is critically 
important. 
I would like to extend thanks to a resident 
of Pennsylvania’s Eleventh District and Viet-
nam Veteran, Harold Redding, a member of 
Chapter 1032 whose citizen advocacy prompt-
ed Congress to pass legislation that made 
possible the creation of the National Vietnam 
War Veterans Day, which will be observed on 
March 29. Thanks to Harold’s efforts and 
those who supported him, our nation has a 
dedicated day where we can come together to 
recognize the sacrifices that these brave men 
and women made so that we may live free. 
On this day and every day, we can honor 
our Vietnam Veterans through providing them 
with the care, recognition, and gratitude that 
they deserve. I extend to Harold and all the 
veterans of Chapter 1032 my most sincere 
thanks and gratitude, and I stand ready to 
support them in any way that I can as a Mem-
ber of Congress.

HONORING THE LIFE AND 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF TODD A. VEGA 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the life and contributions 
of Todd A. Vega, a beloved member of the 
Tampa Bay community, who passed away on 
February 28, 2022 at the age of 60. A fifth 
generation Floridian born and raised in 
Tampa, Todd positively impacted our Tampa 
Bay community in countless ways. 
Todd served for 34 years in the construction 
industry. A long-time Union member, Todd 
worked in various roles including pipefitter, or-
ganizer and most recently as Business Man-
ager of the United Association of Journeymen 
and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe-
fitting Industry (UA) Plumbers Pipefitters Local 
123 in Tampa. He always stood firmly for what 
he believed in and served as a major advo-
cate for workers’ rights throughout his career. 
Todd’s dedication to his work and the people 
around him greatly contributed to the training 
of countless apprentices and journeymen who 
continue to strengthen the industry’s standards 
and quality of work put forward in our commu-
nity. 
Our community honors and grieves the loss 
of his tireless efforts and leadership on behalf 
of his members, the members of the West 
Central FL Labor Council and the Florida Gulf 
Coast Building and Construction Trades Coun-
cil and working families all over Florida. Todd 
was a big man, literally and figuratively, with a 
heart that was even bigger. The biggest gap 
in our community to fill may be his work for 
and devotion to children. Todd was always 
quick to help all as a friend and supporter, but 
it has been said of him that ‘‘you sure never 
had to ask twice when helping kids was in-
volved.’’ The U/A Mechanical Contractors of 
Central Florida Charity Foundation exists to 
serve local children in need of school supplies, 
a toy or other resources that can brighten their 
lives and give them an opportunity. 
Todd’s family and the working men and 
women of Tampa Bay and Florida were at the 
core of his life. They and we are so much bet-
ter for it. I have in my prayers his wife, Shari; 
daughter, Tiffany (Ed); father, Harold; broth-
ers, Troy and James (Kathy); niece, Alisha; 
nephew, J.P.; and grandchildren, Coy, Andy 
and Legend. His memory will truly be a bless-
ing for them and all of us. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors 
in Tampa Bay and the citizens of Florida, I am 
proud to honor Todd A. Vega, his devotion to 
all of us and particularly workers’ rights and 
opportunities. The impacts of Todd’s big heart 
will be felt throughout our community for years 
to come. All in our community and especially 
those of us who called him a friend are eter-
nally grateful for him having passed our way. 
May his soul rest in peace.

Austin overcame the challenges posed by in-
tense competition in his effort to win the Divi-
sion III State Wrestling Championship.

dedication, both on and off the mat, in achiev-
ing this accomplishment is truly outstanding. 
He achieved an impressive season record

RECOGNIZING MR. DAVID 
CARDENAS 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Fowler Mayor, David 
Cardenas, who passed away on Friday, March 
11, 2022. 
Mr. Cardenas was born in Michoacan, Mex-
ico, and moved to the United States when he 
was 14 years old. Like many in the Central 
Valley, his father was a farm worker and in-
stilled a deep sense of hard work, discipline, 
and commitment to family in him from a young 
age. His father pushed him to make a better 
life for himself in America. In 1981, he opened 
Dave’s Auto Service, a business he ran for 
decades. 
Mr. Cardenas was deeply devoted to both 
his faith and his community throughout his en-
tire life. He spent over 20 years on the Fowler 
City Council and spent the past 12 years as 
the city’s mayor. Additionally, he served on 
multiple boards of community organizations, 
such as the Fowler Lions Club, the Measure 
C Renewal Executive Committee, and St. 
Lucy’s Church. He also served as the Presi-
dent of the Guadalupana Society, leading mul-
tiple trips to Mexico to bring a statue of our 
Lady of Guadalupe back to his local church. 
Mr. Cardenas was a true pillar of our com-
munity. His dedicated and honorable service 
helped improve the lives of so many through-
out the Central Valley. His commitment to his 
fellow citizens was truly admirable, and his 
selfless service will never be forgotten. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the life and service of Mayor David 
Cardenas.

HONORING CORINTH TOWN SUPER-
VISOR RICHARD LUCIA ON HIS 
RETIREMENT AFTER YEARS OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Corinth Town Supervisor Rich-
ard Lucia on his retirement. Mr. Lucia served 
his community for nearly forty years, a testa-
ment to the incredible work he has done for 
the people of Corinth. 
Mr. Lucia grew up in Corinth and began 
working at the International Paper mill at a 
young age. He worked in the mill’s power 
plant, ran the paper machine turbines, and fin-
ished off his forty-year career as a clerk. His 
experience at the International Paper mill 
helped him realize the importance of industrial 
strength to Corinth’s economic vitality. 
Mr. Lucia dedicated his storied career to 
serving the community of Corinth in many ca-
pacities. In addition to serving as town super-
visor, Mr. Lucia held numerous roles in the 
community including Town Councilman, Chair-
man of the Saratoga County Board of Super-
visors, and Corinth GOP Committee Chair. Mr. 
Lucia’s love and appreciation for the town of 
Corinth was exemplified through his commit-
ment to serving his constituents. Throughout 
his twenty-eight years as town supervisor, Mr. 
Lucia kept tax rates level, built a new town ga-
rage, and opened the town’s own history and 
paper-making museums. He also oversaw the 
purchase of sixteen miles of rail line from 
Saratoga Springs to Antone Mountain to help 
attract new business to the abandoned Inter-
national Paper mill. 
Throughout his tenure in public service, Mr. 
Lucia prioritized civility while working tirelessly 
to improve the quality of life for residents of 
Corinth. Mr. Lucia dedicated his career to 
being a conscientious steward of the people 
and land for which he loves, ensuring that 
Corinth continues to live up to its full potential. 
His accomplished record and his reputation as 
a community advocate serve as an inspiration 
to all New Yorkers. On behalf of New York’s 
21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
recognize his exceptional leadership and want 
to wish him the best in his future endeavors.
