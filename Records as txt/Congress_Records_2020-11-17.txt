WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2020 
No. 195 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
November 17, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY 
IS THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
nature of democracy is that in every 
election there is a winner and a loser. 
The success of democracy depends on 
the loser believing the vote was fair 
and accepting the result. You see, the 
vote is not the foundation of democ-
racy, the integrity of the vote is its 
foundation. 
That is just as important for the win-
ner as it is for the loser. The winners 
depend on the integrity of the vote for 
their legitimacy. The loser depends on 
it for their acceptance. 
That is precisely the issue in the 
aftermath of this election. The wide-
spread allegations of illegal votes and 
illegal processes must be resolved be-
fore the election can confer legitimacy. 
Among those questions are the accept-
ance of ballots received after election 
day, votes cast by ineligible voters, 
backdated ballots, illegally duplicated 
ballots, 
voting 
systems 
that 
misallocated votes, and the counting of 
votes outside any meaningful observa-
tion. 
Now, there is either evidence to sup-
port these allegations or there is not. 
Fortunately, we are blessed with a 
well-established system of administra-
tive and judicial review to answer 
these questions. 
Georgia, for example, is now under-
taking an audit and hand count. The 
audit should resolve some concerns 
over illegal votes, and the hand count 
should resolve concerns over illegal 
processes. Meanwhile, judges across the 
country are hearing complaints and 
weighing the evidence to support simi-
lar concerns. 
So I rise today to ask that we all 
calm down, stop the hyperbolic rhet-
oric, and allow this process to unfold as 
it should. Our system is more than ca-
pable of working through these issues 
and providing answers that can satisfy 
both sides. 
We also need to ask ourselves why so 
many Americans currently believe the 
election was riddled with fraud. I think 
it is because so many safeguards built 
into our system have been removed. 
We call it ‘‘election day’’ for a rea-
son. Until recently, we all waited until 
the campaigns were over and every 
candidate had their say. 
Then on a single day, election day, 
we personally went to the polling place 
in our community in what George Will 
calls ‘‘the communion of democracy.’’ 
We all took the time because we knew 
it was important. We brought our chil-
dren to watch the process, and we 
taught them to respect it. 
The polling place was often at a 
neighbor’s garage or the local elemen-
tary school. Each of us looked our 
neighbors on the precinct board in the 
eye as we identified ourselves and 
signed the roll. They then handed us 
our ballot. We immediately took that 
ballot into a curtained booth where no 
one could look over our shoulder or 
plead or threaten or cajole us to vote a 
certain way. We cast our vote in abso-
lute privacy, according to our own con-
science, and then handed the ballot 
back to our neighbor, who immediately 
placed it into a locked box in the pres-
ence of observers from all parties. 
It was very hard to commit fraud in 
such a system because every ballot had 
a clear and simple chain of custody. At 
8 p.m., the total number of votes was 
known, and the count began under the 
watchful eye of observers, and we usu-
ally knew the results of most races by 
10 o’clock that night, midnight if it 
was close. 
Now, consider how we have perverted 
that simple and secure process that we 
once prided ourselves upon. Today bal-
lots are mailed out to voter rolls that 
contain untold numbers of people who 
have moved or died. There is no chain 
of custody from the time the ballot is 
mailed until the time it is returned. In 
many States, ballot harvesters can 
knock on doors and collect these sur-
plus ballots. 
Even legitimate votes can be cast 
weeks before the debate is concluded 
and under the duress of family or 
friends or precinct workers. 
This corrupted process cannot con-
tinue. Even if it doesn’t rob our elec-
tions of their actual legitimacy, it cer-
tainly robs them of their perceived le-
gitimacy, destroying the trust that the

loser of any election must have to ac-
cept and respect the will of the elec-
torate. 
The old process assured the presump-
tion of fairness. The new process offers 
none. Acceptance of an election cannot 
be obtained by browbeating. It can 
only be earned by a full and open re-
view of the integrity of the election es-
tablishing for all Americans that their 
vote was fairly and accurately recorded 
and that the result speaks as the will 
of the Nation. And I eagerly await that 
day. 
f 
THE POLITICAL STATUS OF 
PUERTO RICO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to discuss the political status 
of Puerto Rico, which is home to more 
than three million American citizens. 
In my home State of Florida, there 
are now 1.2 million people who were 
born in Puerto Rico or who have Puer-
to Rican roots. That is more than any 
other State. 
Every month, many Puerto Ricans 
move to Florida and other States in 
search of a brighter future. The island 
has been through so much—from the 
economic crisis, to Hurricane Maria, to 
the earthquakes, to COVID–19. 
In Florida, we will always welcome 
these families with open arms, but I 
want them to have more opportunities 
in Puerto Rico. I don’t want them to 
feel like they have no alternative but 
to leave their beloved home. 
In my Orlando district, most of my 
Puerto Rican constituents have family 
members and friends still living on the 
island. Because they care deeply about 
Puerto Rico, I care deeply about Puer-
to Rico. 
But every Member of Congress should 
care about Puerto Rico because Puerto 
Ricans are our fellow American citi-
zens. We are part of the same American 
family, even though the hard truth is 
that the United States hasn’t always 
treated Puerto Rico very well. 
Our country now has the chance to 
do right by Puerto Rico. 
That is because on November 3, Puer-
to Rico held a vote on its political sta-
tus. In a referendum, the people of 
Puerto Rico were asked the following 
question: ‘‘Should Puerto Rico be ad-
mitted immediately into the Union as 
a State?’’ Yes or no? 
Even though Puerto Rico has been a 
U.S. territory since 1898, and the island 
residents have been American citizens 
since 1917, this was the first time the 
people of Puerto Rico were asked this 
simple and direct question. 
According to the results, over 52 per-
cent of voters, more than 623,000 peo-
ple, answered ‘‘yes,’’ while nearly 48 
percent of voters answered ‘‘no.’’ 
The vote was fair, and the results 
were clear. 
At this point, it is beyond dispute 
that a majority of the American citi-
zens living in Puerto Rico want the 
territory to become a State. 
Now, are there people in Puerto Rico 
who would prefer for the island to re-
main a territory or to become a sov-
ereign nation? Absolutely. And that is 
completely valid and legitimate. 
But when it comes to the political 
destiny of a place, the views of the mi-
nority cannot trump or take prece-
dence over the views of the majority. 
That would turn the concept of democ-
racy on its head. Votes matter. 
And now that the people of Puerto 
Rico have spoken, the Federal Govern-
ment must listen. Whether it is the 
White House or Congress, whether it is 
Democrats or Republicans, we must re-
spect and respond to this result. 
To do otherwise would be immoral or 
undemocratic, beneath the dignity of 
our great Nation. 
Let me be crystal clear on two points 
so there is no misunderstanding. 
First, it is well known that I person-
ally support statehood because I think 
it will provide the people of Puerto 
Rico with democracy and equality and 
political power and a better quality of 
life. They do not have these things 
right now and they deserve to have 
them. 
By the way, I am an immigrant and 
a refugee. I grew up in Virginia speak-
ing Vietnamese with my parents. One 
of the main reasons I love America is 
because it is a mix of people from dif-
ferent cultures with different tradi-
tions who speak different languages. I 
reject the notion that statehood would 
weaken Puerto Rico’s beautiful culture 
or its proud traditions or affect the is-
land’s use of the Spanish language. 
Having said all this, even though I 
personally favor statehood, it is not 
my place to substitute my views for 
the views of the people of Puerto Rico. 
If they wished to remain a territory 
or become a nation, I would honor that 
wish. 
However, the majority of voters have 
chosen statehood, and so I intend to re-
spect that choice. 
Finally, let me say this: I am a Dem-
ocrat, but my support for statehood 
has nothing to do with any prediction 
about whether Puerto Rico would be a 
blue State or a red State. History 
teaches us that such predictions tend 
to be wrong, and I personally think 
Puerto Rico would be a swing State 
that elects both Democrats and Repub-
licans. 
However, I would support statehood 
for Puerto Rico if it were as Repub-
lican as Wyoming or as Democratic as 
Vermont. To oppose statehood because 
you fear the people will not vote the 
way you want them to vote violates 
the most basic principles of justice and 
democracy, and I have zero patience for 
that. 
In the coming weeks, I will work 
with Puerto Rico’s governor-elect, resi-
dent commissioner, and legislative as-
sembly, with the incoming Biden ad-
ministration, and with my congres-
sional colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to determine the best path for-
ward. 
I cannot promise a particular result, 
but I can promise I will never stop 
fighting for equality for the American 
citizens of Puerto Rico.

CELEBRATING VETERANS DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last week on November 
11, we celebrated Veterans Day, and I 
rise today to thank each and every one 
of the men and women who have 
donned the uniform of the United 
States military; to express my grati-
tude for the individuals who have 
served to secure and protect our most 
precious freedoms; to acknowledge the 
sacrifices that these brave Americans 
have endured to make America the 
country that it is today. 
In the Pentagon, in the stairwell to 
the office of the Secretary of Defense, 
there is a painting of a soldier in gear 
ready for deployment surrounded by 
family at the altar of a church. 
Accompanying that painting is a 
verse of scripture from the Holy Scrip-
ture from the Book of Isaiah. And it 
reads: ‘‘Who shall I send? Who will go 
for me?’’ In the painting, that is from 
the Gospel and the word of God. That 
painting communicates that our Na-
tion’s veterans have answered that 
call. 
Recently, I was approached about co-
sponsoring H.R. 2350, the Ghost Army 
Congressional Gold Medal Act. A 16- 
year-old young lady named Madeline 
reached out to my office to share the 
story of her great grandfather’s serv-
ice. 
Her great grandfather served in the 
Ghost Army during World War II. The 
Ghost Army was a tactical deception 
unit that sought to undermine the Axis 
Power efforts in Germany during the 
war. 
Madeline shared with me that there 
are two gentlemen from my district 
who served in the Ghost Army, Tom 
Ebeling from Bradford and Claude 
Blake from Patton. 
There are many fascinating stories 
from the Ghost Army that were kept 
secret for decades after the war. It 
wasn’t until 1996 that this information 
was declassified, and their bravery 
could be shared with us all. 
I would also like to mention that 
Veterans Day took place during Na-
tional Apprenticeship Week, and this is 
a great opportunity to remind every-
one what incredible value veterans add 
to our workforce. 
Veterans exhibit proven leadership, 
higher retention rates, have the ability 
to work well under pressure, and they 
have a strong work ethic. 
Our veterans are highly trained and 
highly skilled. They deserve our sup-
port while deployed and when they re-
turn home. One of the best ways to do

that is to prepare them for the work-
force outside of the military. 
I am a proud original cosponsor of 
the Veterans in Effective Apprentice-
ships Act, which instructs apprentice-
ship programs to account for a partici-
pant’s competencies and prior experi-
ences, including those gained during 
military service, among other things. 
Mr. Speaker, the best way to thank a 
veteran is to hire a veteran. The skills 
obtained during service are invaluable. 
In closing, I would like to offer my 
sincerest gratitude one last time to the 
men and women who have selflessly 
served our country in the United 
States military. They have put their 
lives on the line for us, and we are for-
ever indebted to them for this sac-
rifice.

CONGRESS IS THE FINAL ARBITER 
OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE 
SUBMISSIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is the first in a series of House 
floor speeches by me on the recent 
Presidential election. 
Some believe the Supreme Court de-
cides who wins Presidential elections. 
That is wrong. While the Supreme 
Court has a significant judicial role in 
the Presidential election process, the 
United States Constitution and Federal 
law make Congress, not the Supreme 
Court, the judge of who wins Presi-
dential elections. 
Congress must first accept or reject 
State submissions of electoral college 
votes. Thereafter, if no candidate wins 
an electoral college vote majority, 
Congress, not the Supreme Court, votes 
on and elects the next President and 
Vice President of the United States. 
The Constitution’s 12th Amendment 
requires States to submit their elec-
toral college votes to Congress, thereby 
triggering United States Code title 3, 
section 15, which requires that: 
First, Congress shall meet January 6 
following the election at 1 p.m. to re-
ceive States’ electoral college vote sub-
missions. 
Second, the Senate President pre-
sides over all proceedings. 
Third, each State’s electoral college 
submissions shall be opened, presented, 
and acted upon in alphabetical order, 
beginning with the letter A. 
Fourth, the Senate President shall 
receive and publicly announce each 
State’s electoral college vote. 
Fifth, the Senate President shall call 
for objections, if any. Objections must 
be in writing and clearly and concisely 
state, without argument, the objection 
grounds. Further, each objection must 
be signed by at least one Senator and 
one Congressman or be disallowed. 
Sixth, the Senate and House shall 
then separate, and each body shall then 
decide whether to accept or reject elec-
toral college votes that have been prop-
erly objected to. 
Finally, if the House and Senate both 
vote to reject a State’s electoral col-
lege vote submission, those electoral 
college votes shall not be counted in 
the election of the President and Vice 
President. 
United States Code title 3, section 17, 
adds that the Senate and House votes 
to accept or reject electoral college 
votes must occur immediately after no 
more than 2 hours of floor debate. 
This process has been used in the 
past to challenge States’ electoral col-
lege votes. 
For example, in 2005, Democrat Con-
gresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones 
and Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer 
jointly objected to acceptance of Ohio’s 
electoral college votes for Republican 
President George Bush after Ohio elec-
tion officials certified that George 
Bush won Ohio by almost 120,000 votes. 
Similarly, in 2017, numerous Demo-
crat Congressmen objected to all the 
electoral college votes for Republican 
Presidential 
candidate 
Donald 
J. 
Trump from the States of Alabama, 
Florida, 
Georgia, 
Michigan, 
Texas, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, West 
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
These objections failed for lack of a 
Senate cosponsor. 
In sum, the United States Constitu-
tion and Federal law mandate that, on 
January 6, 2021, Congress must decide 
whether to accept or reject States’ sub-
missions of electoral college votes for 
President. 
If a Congressman and Senator jointly 
object, then the full House and full 
Senate must each vote on whether to 
accept or reject a State’s electoral col-
lege vote submission. That vote by 
Congress is final, determinative, and 
nonreviewable. If a State’s electoral 
college votes are rejected, then those 
electoral college votes are excluded 
from candidate totals. 
My second speech in this series cov-
ers what happens if, because of rejected 
electoral college votes, neither can-
didate has the majority of electoral 
college votes needed to be elected 
President of the United States. 
f 
SOUTH CAROLINIANS APPRECIATE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, President Donald Trump was 
extraordinarily successful in South 
Carolina, overcoming the biased fake 
news to have a tremendous victory. 
The voters appreciated record job 
growth for African Americans, His-
panics, and Asian Americans, along 
with record job growth for women and 
youth, along with a restored military 
with peace through strength, pro-
tecting our allies like Israel, as he 
stood for law enforcement to protect 
American families. 
There is true love and affection for 
Donald Trump in South Carolina. 
Democrats wasted the largest on-
slaught ever of cash, with over $200 
million from out-of-State, to patheti-
cally spend money to the point where 
their votes were $120 per vote to lose. 
Democrats unintentionally exposed 
their socialist agenda of everything 
free for everybody, resulting in citizens 
with no freedom, but the political and 
media elites have all the power. 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
was correct that socialism will work 
until it has run out of spending other 
people’s money, always failing. 
In South Carolina, female Repub-
licans were especially targeted by the 
failing Democrats. South Carolina has 
elected the first female Republican 
Congresswoman ever, Congresswoman- 
elect Nancy Mace. The South Carolina 
State Senate has elected, with Penry 
Gustafson of Camden, the first Repub-
lican ever to be elected to the State 
Senate from Kershaw County, joining 
Senators Katrina Shealy of Lexington 
and Sandy Senn of Charleston. 
Despite Democrat dirty tricks, a 
smeared 
Senator 
LINDSEY
GRAHAM 
swept to victory, with Republican 
gains at all levels—Federal, State, and 
local—with the largest number of Re-
publican elected officials in 140 years. 
State 
Party 
Chairman 
Drew 
McKissick 
and 
Executive 
Director 
Hope Walker have been dynamic lead-
ers for successfully leading the victory 
party with Governor Henry McMaster, 
Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette, 
and Attorney General Alan Wilson. 
I am humbled to have lived the mod-
ern Republican revolution, attending 
the swearing-in of State Representa-
tive Charlie Boineau in August 1961 as 
the first elected Republican in the 20th 
century, with State Representative 
Floyd Spence being the first to coura-
geously switch parties in 1962, leading 
today to super Republican majorities 
with all statewide officials now Repub-
licans, along with eight out of nine 
Federal legislators being Republicans. 
I credit my mother, Wray Wilson, for 
my political involvement, as she was a 
pioneering activist in South Carolina 
for President Dwight Eisenhower in 
1952. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

and to celebrate the children and fami-
lies brought together through the 
adoption process. 
Mr. Speaker, I honor the numerous 
organizations and individuals through-
out the First Congressional District 
that offer vital assistance to the chil-
dren in the foster care system. Their 
efforts to help adopted children and 
provide resources for young adults 
aging out of the system go a long way 
in ensuring the safety and well-being of 
this vulnerable population. Their tire-
less efforts and compassion for others 
form the backbone of our child welfare 
system. 
I am honored to join with my col-
leagues in celebration of National 
Adoption Month and to thank all the 
generous organizations and individuals 
in the First Congressional District of 
Kentucky for their dedication to such a 
noble cause. 
RECOGNIZING TODD COUNTY’S 200TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, as the 
Congressman for Kentucky’s First Con-
gressional District, I am proud to rep-
resent 35 counties and numerous com-
munities with their own unique identi-
ties. 
A very special county and city in my 
district are celebrating their 200th an-
niversary this year. Todd County is a 
county I represent on the Kentucky- 
Tennessee State line that is full of 
small towns and rich traditions. 
Todd County, along with the city of 
Elkton, have been a special part of 
western Kentucky for two centuries 
now. 
Whether you reside in Elkton, Guth-
rie, or Trenton, you call home a beau-
tiful county full of wonderful people. 
With a strong farming heritage, agri-
culture continues to play a significant 
role in the local economy. 
2020 is not the ideal year to celebrate 
the two-century milestone, but while 
this 
year 
has 
brought 
significant 
change to our society, one thing has 
not changed: Todd County, Elkton, and 
other rural communities will continue 
to provide a strong voice for small- 
town values in our Nation. 
I am proud to represent the good peo-
ple of Todd County and Elkton in Con-
gress, and I look forward to seeing even 
more prosperous years to come. 
END PROXY VOTING 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, under 
Speaker PELOSI’s leadership, this body 
has experienced a series of new lows. 
One of these failures in leadership 
was encouraging the abdication of our 
duty as lawmakers amid a national cri-
sis. The majority party upended cen-
turies of precedent by allowing proxy 
voting, and now has another terrible 
idea: vote by text. 
As many essential American workers 
have continued working every day, this 
approach mistakenly signals that Con-
gress is above the American people. 
The coronavirus is a serious crisis 
and one that requires Congress to show 
up in person to address our Nation’s 
challenges. I am proud to have shown 
up here at the Capitol alongside my 
Republican colleagues throughout 2020 
to cast votes. 
Members of this body should not be 
able to shield themselves from scrutiny 
by voting on issues without being fully 
present. 
As we close out the year and move 
into 2021, it is imperative that all 
Americans get the full representation 
they deserve in Congress, with their 
elected officials showing up for work. 
HOLD HEARINGS ON ELECTION INTEGRITY 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, today, JIM 
JORDAN, the ranking member of the Ju-
diciary Committee, and myself are 
sending a letter to Chairman NADLER 
and Chairwoman MALONEY, the chairs 
of our respective committees, request-
ing a hearing on the election process, 
the integrity of the election process. 
Just last night, we got a report that 
over 2,000 ballots had just been found in 
Georgia. Ironically, despite the fact 
that all these absentee ballots have 
been breaking overwhelmingly for the 
Democrats and for Joe Biden in the 
Presidential race, this particular batch 
of ballots broke 800 votes in favor of 
Donald Trump. 
Now, I have been hesitant to criticize 
the election process without facts. We 
have facts here. 
It is a fact that there has been a his-
tory of problems with Dominion and 
different election software programs 
that have been used in several of the 
States that are in question in this 
Presidential election. 
We have had all of these hearings in 
the Judiciary Committee and all of 
these hearings in the Oversight and Re-
form Committee on Russia collusion 
that never proved anything, but we 
have a Presidential election that every 
American is watching. Why can’t we 
have hearings on that? 
Mr. Speaker, we are here for the next 
2 weeks. I strongly encourage the Judi-
ciary and Oversight and Reform Com-
mittees to hold a hearing on our elec-
tion integrity.

CALLING FOR COVID–19 AID 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Michigan, 
like many States, continues to see a 
skyrocketing 
number 
of 
COVID–19 
cases. In my own family, we have 
cases, serious cases, of this terrible 
virus. 
This pandemic is far, far from over. 
It is actually getting worse, and Con-
gress has to do its job. 
Families, seniors, small businesses, 
they need our support right now. I have 
heard from thousands of constituents 
who are still struggling to pay their 
bills, to put food on the table, to pay 
rent, and to protect themselves. 
This Congress needs to pass emer-
gency relief now. It has been 6 months

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5803 
November 17, 2020 
since the House passed a COVID relief 
bill, a bill that would put money in the 
pockets of workers, up to $6,000 per 
household; it would extend unemploy-
ment benefits for those people who 
have lost their jobs as a result of this 
pandemic; and it would support small 
businesses, importantly, those small 
businesses that are just on the brink of 
failure, to ensure that relief gets to 
those underserved communities and es-
pecially to some of our nonprofits. 
Sadly, the COVID bill sits on MITCH 
MCCONNELL’s desk, gathering dust. 
This is a pandemic. It is a health cri-
sis. It is an economic crisis. We need to 
come together, put politics aside, nego-
tiate with one another, come to a com-
promise, and help the American people. 
f 
RECOGNIZING VETERANS DAY 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this past Wednesday, we rec-
ognized Veterans Day. 
It is most appropriate that we set 
aside a day each year to thank the 
brave men and women in our Armed 
Forces who have selflessly sacrificed so 
much for our great Nation. 
For more than two centuries, Ameri-
cans have fought under the American 
flag for the principles of freedom, jus-
tice, and equality under the law. 
Our Americans stand tall and are re-
spected worldwide for their dedication 
to country and the sacrifices that they 
have made for our freedom. Many have 
gone to hell and back to preserve the 
natural rights outlined in the Constitu-
tion, specifically freedom of speech, 
freedom of religion, and the right to 
bear arms. 
In eastern North Carolina, I am hon-
ored to represent 95,000 veterans, the 
third most of any congressional dis-
trict in the United States. 
Despite the partisanship oftentimes 
seen in this body, it is critical, like was 
done on this House floor last night, 
that we show broad, bipartisan support 
for our American veterans. 
Their defense of our Nation has not 
been just for Democrat, not just for Re-
publican or independent. It has been 
for all Americans. 
So, again, we say thank you for your 
service, and God bless you all. 
f 
CREDITING OPERATION WARP 
SPEED 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, with America under attack by 
the Wuhan virus, President Donald 
Trump 
announced 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed, led by Vice President MIKE 
PENCE. 
Operation Warp Speed is America’s 
commonsense path toward a historic 
effort to safely bring the virus testing, 
treatments, and vaccines to the Amer-
ican people in record time. 
Extraordinary 
scientists, 
doctors, 
and manufacturers from around the 
Nation are working tirelessly through 
Operation Warp Speed to develop safe 
and effective vaccines. A safe, effective 
vaccine is the key to restoring our nor-
mal way of life and restoring jobs. 
Just this week, Moderna announced 
vaccine success and, thanks to Presi-
dent Trump, vaccine production is un-
derway. 
This is great news for our families 
and for the restoration of jobs, and I 
am grateful that we are closer than 
ever to defeating the pandemic. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

REMEMBERING HUGH PENDLETON 
NUNNALLY, JR. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in remembrance of 
Hugh Pendleton Nunnally, Jr., who was 
a pillar in the Golden Isles community. 
Hugh was born and raised in Atlanta 
and graduated from Georgia Tech with 
a degree in agriculture. After grad-
uating, he was fortunate enough to be 
mentored by Malon Courts of the 
Courts & Company and became a 
broker within 2 years. 
In 1955, he was drafted into the Army 
and finished his service in 1957 as a ser-
geant. 
Following Hugh’s time in the Army, 
he became a founding partner in the 
brokerage firm Budd & Company and 
then a founding partner of Presidential 
Financial Company. 
After the death of his precious wife, 
Miriam, he was devoted to many phil-
anthropic efforts, including the South-
east 
Georgia 
Health 
System, 
the 
Nunnally House, the College of Coastal 
Georgia, the Humane Society of South 
Coastal Georgia, and the Hospice of the 
Golden Isles. 
Hugh will always be remembered for 
his endearing smile, compassion, and 
selflessness. 
My thoughts and prayers are with all 
who knew and loved him during this 
most difficult time.

NIMHD RESEARCH ENDOWMENT 
REVITALIZATION ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4499) to amend the Public Health 
Service Act to provide that the author-
ity of the Director of the National In-
stitute on Minority Health and Health 
Disparities to make certain research 
endowments applies with respect to 
both current and former centers of ex-
cellence, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4499 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘NIMHD Re-
search Endowment Revitalization Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. RESEARCH ENDOWMENTS AT BOTH CUR-
RENT AND FORMER CENTERS OF EX-
CELLENCE. 
Paragraph (1) of section 464z–3(h) of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285t(h)) 
is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Director of the In-
stitute may carry out a program to facilitate 
minority health disparities research and 
other health disparities research by pro-
viding for research endowments— 
‘‘(A) at current or former centers of excel-
lence under section 736; and 
‘‘(B) at current or former centers of excel-
lence under section 464z–4.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4499. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4499, 
the NIMHD Research Endowment Revi-
talization Act of 2020. 
This bill authorizes the National In-
stitute on Minority Health and Health 
Disparities, or NIMHD, to facilitate re-
search on minority health disparities 
through research endowments at cur-
rent or former Centers of Excellence. 
The NIMHD Research Endowment 
Program was established by the Minor-
ity Health and Disparities Research 
and Education Act of 2000. By sup-
porting the endowments of certain aca-
demic institutions, the program pro-
motes minority health and health dis-
parities research capacity, increases 
the diversity of the scientific work-
force, and enhances the recruitment 
and retention of underrepresented indi-
viduals in science. 
Congress expanded the eligibility of 
the program to include institutions of 
higher 
education 
with 
an 
active 
NIMHD Center of Excellence, and this 
expansion inadvertently resulted in

schools such as Morehouse School of 
Medicine, Georgia State University, 
and Morgan State University being in-
eligible. 
As our Nation continues to combat 
the COVID–19 pandemic, there is an 
even more urgent need to support addi-
tional research into minority health 
and health disparities, and to bolster 
the 
recruitment 
and 
retention 
of 
underrepresented 
individuals 
in 
science. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the lead 
sponsors, Representatives BARRAGA´ N, 
CARTER, and the late John Lewis, and 
their staffs, for their work on this leg-
islation. I also thank the Democratic 
and Republican members of our com-
mittee, as well as bipartisan com-
mittee staff, for working together to 
move this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4499, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I, too, rise in support of H.R. 4499, the 
National Institute on Minority and 
Health Disparities Research Endow-
ment Revitalization Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my Committee 
on Energy and Commerce colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, especially Con-
gressman CARTER and Congresswoman 
BARRAGA´ N, for their leadership on this 
bill, and the chairman for moving it. 
This bill authorizes the National In-
stitute on Minority Health and Health 
Disparities to award research grants to 
current and former Centers of Excel-
lence that conduct research on minor-
ity health disparities. 
Health inequalities and inequities are 
disproportionately experienced by mi-
nority populations, and we all know 
they can have adverse impacts on 
health outcomes, on economic opportu-
nities and, frankly, on overall quality 
of life. The COVID–19 pandemic has ex-
acerbated these disparities, which is 
why this legislation is so important, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Continued support of these Centers of 
Excellence is critical in advancing mi-
nority health, addressing health in-
equities, and expanding educational 
and training opportunities for those in-
terested in further advancing research 
in this space. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional Members who would like 
to speak on the bill, and so I urge sup-
port for the legislation. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. LATTA). 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman very much for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4499, the NIMHD Research En-
dowment Revitalization Act of 2020. 
This is an extremely important piece 
of legislation, and I intend to support 
it. 
I also intend to ask the House today 
to support my legislation, which is 
H.R. 4806, the Debarment Enforcement 
of Bad Actor Registrants Act of 2019, or 
the DEBAR Act. 
Substance abuse continues to wreak 
havoc in our communities and is re-
sponsible for claiming nearly 700,000 
lives since 1999. In the first quarter of 
this year alone, overdose death rates 
increased 11.4 percent compared to the 
same time last year. 
As we work to put an end to the 
coronavirus pandemic, addressing the 
ongoing opioid epidemic is increasingly 
critical. 
b 1215 
I introduced the DEBAR Act because 
it takes significant steps to reduce the 
circulation of illegal substances in our 
country. 
This bill provides the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency debarment authority to 
permanently prohibit a person or enti-
ty who has violated the Controlled 
Substances Act from being able to re-
ceive a registration to manufacture, 
distribute, or dispense a controlled sub-
stance. 
We cannot stop our efforts to end the 
opioid and substance abuse crisis, and I 
encourage my colleagues to support 
H.R. 4806 and H.R. 4499. 
I also want to thank the chairman 
for his work on both of these pieces of 
legislation, and the ranking member, 
and I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port both pieces of legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), one of the coauthors 
of this piece of legislation. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the 
time today to speak on this important 
legislation, and I thank Congress-
woman BARRAGA´ N for being a champion 
of this issue. 
The coronavirus has wreaked havoc 
on our communities. Now, more than 
ever, we must support minority aca-
demic institutions and the critical re-
search they conduct. Minority aca-
demic institutions can play a big role 
in conducting critical research and 
helping us work to lessen the health 
disparities minority communities face. 
We must ensure schools, including 
the Morehouse College in my home 
State of Georgia, are able to conduct 
their 
research 
without 
disruption. 
Their efforts will better prepare all of 
us to respond to the coronavirus and 
other health inequities more effec-
tively. 
I urge passage today. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
believe we have any other Members 
wishing to speak on this legislation, so 
I will just close and say it is another 
great work product from our Energy 
and Commerce Committee, bipartisan 
legislation that I encourage our col-
leagues to support, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 4499, the NIMHD Research 
Endowment Revitalization Act, a bill I intro-
duced with my friend and colleague from 
Georgia, Congressman CARTER. 
This legislation moves us closer to ending 
the disparities in public health between minor-
ity communities and other Americans. We 
need to understand why people in minority 
communities are more likely to get certain ill-
nesses and how we can prevent that. H.R. 
4499 will fund the research that will help us 
find solutions. 
If signed into law, this bill will once again 
allow for current and former NIMHD or HRSA 
Centers of Excellence to receive research en-
dowment funding, money that is critical in the 
fight to reduce minority health disparities. 
The Research Endowment Program at the 
National Institute on Minority Health and 
Health Disparities provides funding to the en-
dowments of academic institutions across the 
country, such as Charles Drew University in 
my district. 
The goals of the program include: 
Promoting minority health and health dis-
parities research capacity and infrastructure; 
Increasing the diversity and strength of the 
scientific workforce; and 
Enhancing the recruitment and retention of 
individuals from health disparity populations 
that are underrepresented in the scientific 
workforce. 
Charles Drew University has stated that this 
legislation and the funding are critical to their 
mission and that they support this legislation 
because: 
‘‘Restoring eligibility would allow the Univer-
sity to continue its historic focus on research 
to close the gap between the burden of illness 
and premature mortality experienced more 
commonly by communities of color, as well as 
other medically underserved populations, as 
compared to the nation as a whole. It would 
also help to grow and enhance the Univer-
sity’s capacity and infrastructure for health dis-
parities research within the Urban Health Insti-
tute.’’ 
During the COVID health emergency, where 
communities of color are once again dis-
proportionately affected, research into health 
disparities is more crucial than ever. 
I want to once again thank my colleague 
Congressman CARTER for co-leading this bill 
with me, as well as the other bipartisan co-
sponsors: Congresswoman KELLY, Congress-
man ROGERS, and the late John Lewis. I also 
want to thank Chairman PALLONE for working 
with me to help move this important bill 
through the Committee. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the 
NIMHD Research Endowment Revitalization 
Act so that these schools can continue this im-
portant research on minority health disparities. 
CHARLES R. DREW UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE AND 
SCIENCE STATEMENT ON H.R. 4499 
Charles R. Drew University of Medicine in 
Science (CDU) is in strong support of H.R. 
4499 which amend the Public Health Service 
Act to provide that the authority of the Di-
rector of the National Institute on Minority 
Health and Health Disparities to make cer-
tain research endowments applies with re-
spect to both current and former centers of 
excellence, and for other purposes. 
If enacted H.R. 4499 would reinstate the 
University’s eligibility for NIMHD endow-
ment grants that were withdrawn because 
the University had received endowment 
grants for 10 years despite being underfunded 
for its critical health disparities research.

The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5668 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Making Objec-
tive Drug Evidence Revisions for New Labeling 
Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘MODERN Labeling Act of

TAIN GENERIC DRUGS. 
Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is amended 
by inserting after section 503C the following: 
‘‘SEC. 503D. PROCESS TO UPDATE LABELING FOR 
CERTAIN DRUGS. 
‘‘(a) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this sec-
tion: 
‘‘(1) The term ‘covered drug’ means a drug ap-
proved under section 505(c)— 
‘‘(A) for which there are no unexpired patents 
included in the list under section 505(j)(7) and 
no unexpired period of exclusivity; 
‘‘(B) for which the approval of the application 
has been withdrawn for reasons other than 
safety or effectiveness; and 
‘‘(C) for which— 
‘‘(i)(I) there is new scientific evidence avail-
able pertaining to the existing conditions of use 
that is not reflected in the labeling; 
‘‘(II) the approved labeling does not reflect 
current legal and regulatory requirements for 
content or format; or 
‘‘(III) there is a relevant accepted use in clin-
ical practice that is not reflected in the ap-
proved labeling; and

The Secretary may identify covered drugs for 
which labeling updates would provide a public 
health benefit. To assist in identifying covered 
drugs, the Secretary may do one or both of the 
following: 
‘‘(1) Enter into cooperative agreements or con-
tracts with public or private entities to review 
the available scientific evidence concerning such 
drugs. 
‘‘(2) Seek public input concerning such drugs, 
including input on whether there is a relevant 
accepted use in clinical practice that is not re-
flected in the approved labeling of such drugs or 
whether new scientific evidence is available re-
garding the conditions of use for such drug, 
by— 
‘‘(A) holding one or more public meetings; 
‘‘(B) opening a public docket for the submis-
sion of public comments; or 
‘‘(C) other means, as the Secretary determines 
appropriate. 
‘‘(c) SELECTION OF DRUGS FOR UPDATING.—If

ered drug, that the available scientific evidence 
meets the standards under section 505 for add-
ing or modifying information to the labeling or 
providing supplemental information to the label-
ing regarding the use of the covered drug, the 
Secretary may initiate the process under sub-
section (d). 
‘‘(d) INITIATION OF THE PROCESS OF UPDAT-
ING.—If the Secretary determines that labeling 
changes are appropriate for a selected drug pur-
suant to subsection (c), the Secretary shall pro-
vide notice to the holders of approved applica-
tions for a generic version of such drug that— 
‘‘(1) summarizes the findings supporting the 
determination of the Secretary that the avail-
able scientific evidence meets the standards 
under section 505 for adding or modifying infor-
mation or providing supplemental information 
to the labeling of the covered drug pursuant to 
subsection (c); 
‘‘(2) provides a clear statement regarding the 
additional, modified, or supplemental informa-
tion for such labeling, according to the deter-
mination by the Secretary (including, as appli-
cable, modifications to add the relevant accept-
ed use to the labeling of the drug as an addi-
tional indication for the drug); and 
‘‘(3) states whether the statement under para-
graph (2) applies to the selected drug as a class 
of covered drugs or only to a specific drug prod-
uct. 
‘‘(e) RESPONSE TO NOTIFICATION.—Within 30 
days of receipt of notification provided by the 
Secretary pursuant to subsection (d), the holder 
of an approved application for a generic version 
of the selected drug shall— 
‘‘(1) agree to change the approved labeling to 
reflect the additional, modified, or supplemental 
information the Secretary has determined to be 
appropriate; or 
‘‘(2) notify the Secretary that the holder of 
the approved application does not believe that 
the requested labeling changes are warranted 
and submit a statement detailing the reasons 
why such changes are not warranted. 
‘‘(f) REVIEW
OF APPLICATION HOLDER’S RE-
SPONSE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Upon receipt of the appli-
cation holder’s response, the Secretary shall 
promptly review each statement received under 
subsection (e)(2) and determine which labeling 
changes pursuant to the Secretary’s notice 
under subsection (d) are appropriate, if any. If 
the Secretary disagrees with the reasons why 
such labeling changes are not warranted, the 
Secretary shall provide opportunity for discus-
sions with the application holders to reach 
agreement on whether the labeling for the cov-
ered drug should be updated to reflect available 
scientific evidence, and if so, the content of such 
labeling changes. 
‘‘(2) CHANGES TO LABELING.—After considering 
all responses from the holder of an approved ap-
plication under paragraph (1) or (2) of sub-
section (e), and any discussion under paragraph 
(1), the Secretary may order such holder to 
make the labeling changes the Secretary deter-
mines are appropriate. Such holder of an ap-
proved application shall— 
‘‘(A) update its paper labeling for the drug at 
the next printing of that labeling; 
‘‘(B) update any electronic labeling for the 
drug within 30 days of such order; and 
‘‘(C) submit the revised labeling through the 
form, ‘Supplement—Changes Being Effected’. 
‘‘(g) VIOLATION.—If the holder of an approved 
application for the generic version of the se-
lected drug does not comply with the require-
ments of subsection (f)(2), such generic version 
of the selected drug shall be deemed to be mis-
branded under section 502. 
‘‘(h) LIMITATIONS; GENERIC DRUGS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—With respect to any label-
ing change required under this section, the ge-
neric version shall be deemed to have the same 
conditions of use and the same labeling as its 
reference listed drug for purposes of clauses (i) 
and (v) of section 505(j)(2)(A). Any labeling 
change so required shall not have any legal ef-
fect for the applicant that is different than the 
legal effect that would have resulted if a supple-
mental application had been submitted and ap-
proved to conform the labeling of the generic 
version to a change in the labeling of the ref-
erence drug. 
‘‘(2) SUPPLEMENTAL
APPLICATIONS.—Changes 
to labeling made in accordance with this section 
shall not be eligible for an exclusivity period 
under this Act. 
‘‘(3) SELECTION
OF
DRUGS.—Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to give the Secretary 
the authority to identify a drug as a covered 
drug or select a drug label for updating solely 
based on the availability of new safety informa-
tion. Upon identification of a drug as a covered 
drug, the Secretary may then consider the avail-
ability of new, additional, or different safety in-
formation in determining whether the drug is a 
selected drug and in determining what labeling 
changes are appropriate. 
‘‘(4) MAINTENANCE OF LABELING.—Nothing in 
this section shall be construed to affect the re-
sponsibility of the holder of an approved appli-
cation under section 505(j) to maintain its label-
ing in accordance with existing requirements, 
including subpart B of part 201 and sections 
314.70 and 314.97 of title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations (or any successor regulations). 
‘‘(i) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
‘‘(1) 
APPROVAL
STANDARDS.—This 
section 
shall not be construed as altering the applica-
bility of the standards for approval of an appli-
cation under section 505. No order shall be 
issued under this subsection unless the scientific 
evidence supporting the changed labeling meets 
the standards for approval applicable to any 
change to labeling under section 505. 
‘‘(2) SECRETARY AUTHORITY.—Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to limit the authority 
of the Secretary to require labeling changes 
under section 505(o). 
‘‘(j) REPORTS.—Not later than 4 years after 
the date of the enactment of the Making Objec-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5668. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5668, the MODERN Labeling 
Act. 
Prescription drug labels contain the 
most authoritative drug-related infor-
mation available to prescribers. These 
labels let prescribers know about ap-
proved uses for a drug and important 
patient safety information. 
However, over time, labels can be-
come outdated as more information be-
comes known about a drug, but a man-
ufacturer may not update the label 
with the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to identify new uses for drugs. 
This is especially likely to happen with 
some older generic drugs where there 
may be commonly accepted off-label 
uses but no FDA-sanctioned method of 
communicating those safe uses. 
In some cases, a generic drug may 
have an outdated label due to a loop-
hole in the law. Under this loophole, if 
a listed brand drug leaves the market 
while a generic competitor remains, 
there is no way for the generic drug to 
update its label with approved new 
uses. This is because generic drugs 
must maintain the same drug informa-
tion on their labels as their branded 
counterparts, even when their branded 
counterpart has left the market. 
This 
bipartisan 
legislation, 
Mr. 
Speaker, would fix this problem. H.R. 
5668 would allow FDA to identify drugs 
that have out-of-date labels and pursue 
revised labeling, allowing new uses and 
new indications to be listed. This will 
allow FDA and generic drug manufac-
turers to ensure that drug labels, the 
most trusted source of drug use infor-
mation, include the best information 
available. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important to note 
that both brand and generic manufac-
turers have the responsibility to work 
with FDA to update drug safety infor-
mation that becomes known and that 
does not change under this bill. 
Amendments adopted through our 
committee process ensure that, when a 
manufacturer needs to update a label 
solely with new safety information, 
manufacturers and FDA must pursue 
such changes through the current proc-
ess. Drug safety is paramount, and we 
want patients to have certainty that 
they will have up-to-date safety infor-
mation. 
As Dr. Jeff Allen from the Friends of 
Cancer Research said at our hearing on 
this bill: ‘‘Preserving the accuracy and 
reliability of labeling may be viewed as 
tantamount to preserving trust in and 
the relevance of the drug approval sys-
tem.’’ 
And I cannot agree more, Mr. Speak-
er. Maintaining our trust in the FDA 
approval process is critical, and this 
bill will help strengthen the system. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5668. This is the MODERN La-
beling Act, and I want to thank our 
colleagues, Representatives GUTHRIE 
and MATSUI, for their leadership on 
this important legislation which will 
allow the FDA to require modifications 
be made to outdated labeling for ge-
neric drugs. 
Now, while drug manufacturers are 
required to update a label when it be-
comes inaccurate, false, or misleading, 
there is no such requirement when new 
scientific information indicates there 
may be a new use for the product. 
Generic drugs are generally required 
to have the same labeling as the brand 
drug they reference; however, once the 
brand drug is no longer on the market, 
the generic manufacturer is actually 
prohibited from updating their label to 
reflect the most accurate, up-to-date 
information, information that is often 
discovered through postmarket use. So 
the inability to update labeling can re-
sult in information gaps for providers 
and patients when discussing treat-
ments. 
For example, it has been estimated 
that more than half, Mr. Speaker— 
half—of all uses of cancer drugs are off- 
label, meaning the drug is used for a 
disease or medical condition that it is 
not approved to treat. Many of these 
uses are widely accepted in the medical 
community and based on the most up- 
to-date scientific evidence; however, 
they are not reflected in FDA-approved 
labeling. 
So H.R. 5668 would help. It would 
close this existing information gap. It 
would give doctors and patients the in-
formation they need when making de-
cisions about their treatment options. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve we have a speaker on the other 
side, so I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), one of our terrific 
leaders on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee on the Republican side and 
someone who put a lot of time and ef-
fort into this bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
I appreciate working with the chair-
man and with everyone involved in this 
piece of legislation. 
I rise today to voice my support for 
H.R. 5668, the MODERN Labeling Act of 
2020. This important bill will ensure 
that certain drug labels are updated 
and accurate, which will result in bet-
ter care for many Americans who are 
suffering. This bill grants FDA the au-
thority to work with generic drug com-
panies to update their product label 
when there are strong, scientific bases 
for another indication or use of the 
drug. 
Innovation in America is constantly 
evolving, and we must ensure drug la-
bels are updated and not frozen in time 
just because the brand-name drug is off 
the market and preventing the generic 
drug from updating its label. 
I would like to thank Representative 
MATSUI, Chairman PALLONE, and the 
majority and minority Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
staff 
who 
worked with me to make this legisla-
tion possible. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire if the gentleman has any addi-
tional speakers. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, no, I do 
not. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of our Members to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 5668, the MODERN Labeling Act. I’m 
proud to have advanced this bipartisan bill 
through my Health Subcommittee and I’m 
proud to support it on the Floor today. 
The MODERN Labeling Act was introduced 
by Representatives DORIS MATSUI and BRET 
GUTHRIE, and allows generic drug companies 
to update outdated labeling 
Drug labeling can become outdated when 
new scientific evidence is discovered after a 
drug is on the market, yet drug manufacturers 
are not required by law to update their prod-
ucts’ labeling with new uses. 
Because of this system, the labeling of 
many cancer drugs, especially older generic 
products, are out of date. Outdated labeling 
can affect insurance and Medicare coverage 
of the drugs, creating potentially high out-of- 
pocket costs for consumers. 
H.R. 5668 addresses this problem by giving 
the FDA the authority to require labels to re-
flect new information relevant to the drug and 
its use. 
This is a commonsense bill that will help 
more cancer patients have access to the treat-
ments they need and I urge all my colleagues 
to support this legislation.

retary shall not grant, recognize, or apply 
exclusive approval or licensure under sub-
section (a), and, if such exclusive approval or 
licensure has been granted, recognized, or 
applied, shall revoke such exclusive approval 
or licensure, unless the sponsor of the appli-
cation for such drug demonstrates— 
‘‘(A) with respect to an application ap-
proved or a license issued after the date of 
enactment of this subsection, upon such ap-
proval or issuance, that there is no reason-
able expectation at the time of such approval 
or issuance that the cost of developing and 
making available in the United States such 
drug for such disease or condition will be re-
covered from sales in the United States of 
such drug, taking into account all sales 
made or reasonably expected to be made 
within 12 years of first marketing the drug; 
or 
‘‘(B) with respect to an application ap-
proved or a license issued on or prior to the 
date of enactment of this subsection, not 
later than 60 days after such date of enact-

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on H.R. 
4712. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support 
of H.R. 4712, the Fairness in Orphan 
Drug Exclusivity Act, a bill that will 
close a loophole in the orphan drug 
program to ensure generic drugs are 
not unfairly being blocked from enter-
ing the market. 
Since it was first passed in 1983, the 
Orphan Drug Act has been successful in 
driving research and discovery of new 
therapies to treat and even cure rare 
diseases. The law creates two pathways 
for manufacturers to be designated as 
an orphan drug and to gain certain in-
centives, including 7 years of market 
exclusivity. 
The first and most commonly used 
pathway is for developing drugs ap-
proved to treat diseases with patient 
populations of 200,000 or fewer. There is 
also the rarely used cost-recovery 
pathway, where the drug research and 
development costs are not expected to 
be recouped by sales of the underlying 
drug. 
Now, under certain circumstances, a 
manufacturer may also receive addi-
tional rounds of exclusivity for drugs 
in their portfolio if they treat the same 
conditions and have the same active in-
gredient, even if the second drug does 
not meet the orphan drug qualifica-
tions. This provision has allowed some 
manufacturers to circumvent the origi-
nal intent of the Orphan Drug Act, 
which was to incentivize creation of 
novel drugs for small populations, all 
the while blocking generic competitors 
from coming to market. 
An example of this recently occurred 
when a formulation of Buprenorphine, 
a drug to treat opioid use disorder, was 
approved in 2017. It was allowed to 
carry the orphan drug designation 
granted to its manufacturer’s original 
Buprenorphine drug more than 20 years 
earlier, in 1994. 
When the original 1994 orphan drug 
designation was granted, it was ex-
pected that Buprenorphine would not 
be prescribed frequently; however, as 
the opioid crisis worsened and our re-
sponse to the crisis evolved, millions 
were eventually prescribed the drug, 
generating billions of dollars in sales. 
Clearly, 
we 
knew 
in 
2017 
that 
Buprenorphine was not an orphan drug. 
Nevertheless, the drug was granted or-
phan drug status and exclusivity, de-
laying additional forms of generic com-
petition. So while the Food and Drug 
Administration eventually recognized 
this issue with this particular drug and 
revoked its orphan drug designation, 
its exclusivity delayed generic com-
petition that otherwise would have 
been on the market. 
We need every tool available to us to 
combat the opioid epidemic, and loop-
holes like this one should not be al-
lowed to limit access to treatment, Mr. 
Speaker. 
H.R. 4712 will stop this from hap-
pening again in the future by requiring 
drug manufacturers to demonstrate in 
their application to the FDA that each 
drug application considered under the 
cost recovery pathway would fail to re-
coup development costs. 
This bill is narrowly tailored. It is a 
fix for a small but very real loophole in 
the law, and I want to thank Rep-
resentative DEAN for introducing the 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

H5808 
November 17, 2020 
b 1230 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of 
H.R. 4712. This is the Fairness in Or-
phan Drug Exclusivity Act as you have 
heard. I want to thank Representatives 
CARTER, MCKINLEY, DEAN, and VEASEY 
for their work and leadership on this 
important legislation. 
The Orphan Drug Act was enacted to 
incentivize the development of drugs 
for rare diseases by providing products 
that receive an orphan drug designa-
tion 7 years of market exclusivity. 
That means a drug produced by an-
other manufacturer that contains the 
same active ingredient to treat the 
same condition is barred from entering 
the market during this time period. 
One way a drug can receive an or-
phan designation and subsequent mar-
keting exclusivity is by the manufac-
turer’s demonstration that there is no 
reasonable expectation that the cost of 
developing the drug will be recovered. 
However, we have seen in recent 
years that some drug manufacturers, 
in an effort to block competitors from 
entering the market, have taken ad-
vantage of a loophole in this law. Ex-
isting law allows an orphan drug des-
ignation and marketing exclusivity to 
carry forward to future versions of the 
same drug without requiring the manu-
facturer to demonstrate the drug has 
not been, and remains unlikely to be, 
profitable. This legislation closes that 
loophole. It requires manufacturers to 
demonstrate there is no reasonable ex-
pectation that the costs of research 
and development will be recovered for 
each successor drug, while still pre-
serving incentives for orphan drug de-
velopment. 
While disagreements do remain, Mr. 
Speaker, on whether these amend-
ments 
should 
apply 
retroactively, 
those differences should not prevent us 
from addressing this important issue 
today. 
So I look forward to continuing nego-
tiations on these differences as we 
work with the Senate and get a bill 
down to the President’s desk for signa-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN), who is the 
sponsor of the legislation. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4712, the Fairness in Or-
phan Drug Exclusivity Act. 
This legislation would close a current 
loophole that is used to block competi-
tion in the pharmaceutical market-
place. 
This 
could 
deny 
innovative 
treatments for opioid use disorder and 
limit the types of treatments for those 
in recovery and what they can access. 
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 has pro-
vided incentives for prescription drug 
manufacturers to develop products to 
treat rare diseases. This includes an ex-
clusive 7-year marketing right for 
therapies that receive an orphan drug 
designation. 
For a drug to qualify, it must either 
be a treatment for a disease or condi-
tion that affects fewer than 200,000 peo-
ple in the United States; 
Or a drug intended for diseases that 
there is no reasonable expectation to 
recoup research and development costs. 
For the latter criterion, this legisla-
tion would require all drug manufac-
turers who obtain orphan drug status 
to prove that they have no reasonable 
expectation that they will recover 
their R&D costs. Importantly, this leg-
islation is narrowly tailored and would 
not affect any product that does re-
ceive orphan drug status under the 
first criterion. 
The scenario this legislation works 
to prevent, as the chairman has said, is 
companies continuing to use orphan 
drug exclusivity status for a newly ap-
proved drug with an identical ingre-
dient to the former version without 
having to prove the inability to recoup 
costs. Closing this loophole would en-
sure that a product does not receive 
unfair market advantage and, there-
fore, remains consistent with the spirit 
and the intent of the Orphan Drug Act. 
In addition, H.R. 4712 clears barriers 
for 
innovative 
medication-assisted 
treatments, or MATs, coming to mar-
ket that will help treat those with sub-
stance use disorder. Substance use dis-
order is by no means a rare disease and 
should not be treated as such. Medica-
tion-assisted treatments can and do 
save lives. 
According to the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse, in 2016 more than 2.1 
million Americans were living with 
opioid use disorder, but just over 17 
percent of people received specialty 
treatment. Medication-assisted treat-
ment is one of those personalized op-
tions. We must work to ensure more 
people can gain access to newer thera-
pies and MAT treatments that are cur-
rently blocked due to an orphan des-
ignation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the bipartisan 
group of legislators who introduced 
this bill with me: Congressmen BUDDY 
CARTER, MARC
VEASEY, and DAVID 
MCKINLEY, as well as Chairman PAL-
LONE and Ranking Member BURGESS, 
for supporting the bill, and passing it 
unanimously out of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), who is one of the co-
authors of this very important legisla-
tion and who is the only—I think still 
only—pharmacist in the United States 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the 
time today to let me speak on this im-
portant legislation, and I thank Con-
gresswoman DEAN for introducing it. 
I am glad to be a lead Republican on 
this bill, as it corrects a loophole in 
the Orphan Drug Act that has been and 
very well could be taken advantage of 
at the expense of the American people’s 
health. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Or-
phan Drug Act provides incentives for 
drug manufacturers to invest in re-
search to bring innovative drugs to 
market that may not become profit-
able or that treat a small portion of 
the population. 
Unfortunately, a loophole exists that 
allows some drugs to obtain market ex-
clusivity even though they can easily 
recoup their R&D costs and turn a prof-
it. This exact problem took place in 
just the past few years when a drug 
treating opioid abuse disorders got 
FDA approval—orphan status—and a 
new 7-year exclusivity period, despite 
the active ingredient remaining the 
same, all based on the drug’s original 
1994 orphan designation. This subse-
quently blocked a new, innovative 
opioid abuse drug from coming to mar-
ket during the opioid epidemic—a drug 
that would help save lives. 
The Orphan Drug Fairness Act would 
stop some drugs from obtaining exclu-
sivity, in turn allowing more competi-
tion and innovation in the market-
place, benefiting consumers’ health 
and lowering costs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I do not 
have any more speakers on my side of 
the aisle on this matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues to ap-
prove the bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, I urge passage 
of the bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 4712, the Fairness in Orphan Drug Ex-
clusivity Act. I’m proud to have advanced this 
bipartisan 
bill 
through 
my 
Health 
Sub-
committee and I’m proud to support it on the 
Floor today. 
The Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act 
was introduced by Reps. MADELINE DEAN (D– 
PA), MARC VEASEY (D–TX), BUDDY CARTER 
(R–GA), and DAVID MCKINLEY (R–WV). 
The bill will close a loophole so that orphan 
drug exclusivity cannot be used to deny ac-
cess to certain drugs, especially drugs for 
opioid use disorder. 
This is a narrowly drawn bill to fix a tech-
nical problem without hurting the original inten-
tion of the Orphan Drug Act. It requires drug 
companies to show that they will not recoup 
costs each year in order to achieve the orphan 
drug designation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4712. Understandably, our nation 
has focused on COVID, but the opioid epi-
demic still ravishes across America. During 
this crisis overdose rates have increased dra-
matically. In fact, in West Virginia more people 
have died from drug abuse than from COVID. 
We have a duty to our constituents to en-
sure that all possible treatment options are 
available. MAT (Medication Assisted Treat-
ment), has been proven to be effective in 
treating opioid addiction. Yet, drug companies 
are holding new treatments hostage through a

loophole in the Orphan Drug Act, which was 
created to encourage drug companies to re-
search treatments for rare diseases. 
It was not intended to prevent competition. 
With millions of Americans suffering from 
opioid addiction, it is vital we give them and 
health care providers every option available. 
The Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act 
will help expand access for those suffering 
from addiction by making innovative treat-
ments available. 
I urge my colleagues to support the pas-
sage of H.R. 4712. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4712, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
STATE OPIOID RESPONSE GRANT 
AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2466) to extend the State Opioid

(b) CLERICAL
AMENDMENT.—The table of 
sections in section 1(b) of such Act is amend-
ed by striking the item relating to section 
1003 and inserting the following: 
‘‘Sec. 1003. Grant program for State and 
Tribal response to substance 
use disorders of significance.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2466. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act of 2020. 
While the coronavirus pandemic is at 
the forefront of our minds, the opioid 
epidemic and evolving drug crisis also 
continues to be a public health emer-
gency that we must also address. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, more than 
750,000 Americans have died since 1999 
from a drug overdose, and in 2018 two 
out of three drug overdose deaths in-
volved an opioid. Recent data from the 
2019 National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health indicates that over 20 million 
Americans have a substance use dis-
order and, unfortunately, only a frac-
tion of those Americans receive the 
care they need. 
Building upon congressional efforts 
like the 21st Century Cures Act and the 
SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-
nities Act, this bill would authorize the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, or SAMHSA, 
State Opioid Response, SOR, grant pro-
gram and align the authorization with 
authorities in the 21st Century Cures 
Act to meet the current needs of 
States. Assistant Secretary for Health, 
Admiral Brett Giroir, testified before 
our committee, Mr. Speaker, that 
SAMHSA’s SOR grants provide a high 
degree of flexibility to States working 
to combat the drug epidemic. 
The SAMHSA SOR grant program 
has been funded through appropria-
tions legislation since fiscal year 2018, 
but it does not have a statutory au-
thorization. With this bill, we are en-
suring that both the Federal support 
and flexibility continue into the fu-
ture. 
Currently, SOR grants help commu-
nities tackle the drug crisis by reduc-
ing 
barriers 
to 
medication-assisted 
treatment for opioid use disorder, ef-
fectively chipping away at the treat-
ment gap. The grants aid in reducing 
drug overdose-related deaths by sup-
porting prevention and recovery activi-
ties across the States. This program 
also supports evidence-based preven-
tion, treatment, and recovery support 
services to address stimulant misuse 
and use disorders, which is a growing 
issue, also, in many regions of the 
country. 
So I commend the lead sponsors of 
this 
legislation, 
Representatives 
TRONE, 
ARMSTRONG, 
SHERRILL, 
and 
RIGGLEMAN, and their staffs for their 
tireless work on this bill. I also thank 
the Democratic and Republican mem-
bers of the committee, as well as bipar-
tisan committee staff, for working to-
gether to move this bill. I hope that 
the Senate will act on this legislation 
sooner rather than later. 
Mr. Speaker, the drug crisis con-
tinues to affect all walks of life. They 
are our friends, our family, and our 
neighbors. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of 
H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act which, as you 
heard, was introduced by Representa-
tives TRONE, ARMSTRONG, SHERRILL, 
and RIGGLEMAN. 
I would like to thank Representative 
TRONE for leading this work on this bill 
and for working with us to get the lan-
guage to a good place. We appreciate 
that. 
When I chaired the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, I think we passed 
out something like 60 or more pieces of 
legislation dealing with the opioid cri-
sis. All of them were cosponsored by 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans—bipar-
tisan effort—that became the SUP-
PORT Act signed by President Trump 
into law now almost over 2 years ago. 
I just want to say this epidemic con-
tinues, and so does our work. It has 
been made worse by the pandemic as 
people have turned to these sorts of 
medications to help themselves cope, 
and it is sad. 
This important bill would authorize 
appropriations for the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration’s State Opioid Response grant 
program by placing it under the 21st 
Century Cures Act, which first estab-
lished State Response to Opioid Abuse 
Crisis grants. 
The United States remains in the 
midst of this opioid crisis, and it has 
been exacerbated, as I said, by the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
But 
Federal 
grants have provided a substantial 
level of support for innovative and life-
saving programs in States across the 
country that are on the front-lines of 
addressing substance use disorders. By 
authorizing this grant program and 
aligning it with the initiatives estab-
lished in the 21st Century Cures Act, 
H.R. 2466 would ensure continued, reli-
able support for substance use disorder 
prevention, treatment, and recovery ef-
forts. 
Of course, Mr. Speaker, I strongly 
lend my support to passage of this leg-
islation, and I join with the chairman 
of the committee, Mr. PALLONE, in urg-
ing our colleagues across the building 
to act swiftly on this. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE), who is the sponsor of 
the legislation. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
my bill, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act. This bill di-
rectly addresses the country’s wors-
ening opioid crisis as we continue to 
see overdose deaths surge during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
This bipartisan bill authorizes $9 bil-
lion over 6 years in flexible funding 
through grants for States and Tribes to 
fight the opioid epidemic on the front 
lines. 
This bill helps provide States the 
steady, 
sustained, 
and 
consistent 
money they need for programs to: Pre-
vent addiction through evidence-based 
programs; 
Increase access to outpatient and res-
idential 
treatment, 
particularly 
through 
medication-assisted 
treat-
ment; 
Prevent 
overdoses 
by 
expanding 
naloxone distribution; 
And support individuals in recovery 
with recovery housing and peer sup-
ports. 
Since 2000, there have been over 
550,000 deaths from opioids, and the 
CDC estimates the cost to our country 
is $78.5 billion per year. There is no 
magic bullet to fix the opioid crisis. 
There will be no vaccine. We need con-
sistent funding to help save these lives. 
Last year, nearly 71,000 people died 
from an overdose—the most ever. The 
COVID–19 pandemic will push these 
numbers even higher. 
In western Maryland, we have seen 
an increase of overdose deaths from the 
first half of 2020 compared to the first 
half of 2019 by 46 percent up in Wash-
ington County, 50 percent up in Garrett 
County, and 54 percent up in Allegany 
County. 
Across the country, over 40 States 
have reported an increase in overdose 
deaths since the start of this pandemic. 
These numbers are absolutely tragic 
and unacceptable. We must act. 
Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic 
does not know the color of your skin, 
where you live, or your political party. 
The opioid epidemic destroys every-
thing in its path. 
It hit my family, too. On December 
31, 2016, my nephew, Ian Jacob Trone, 
died alone in a hotel room from a 
fentanyl overdose. 
b 1245 
Ian was in recovery for 13 of the last 
16 months of his life, but it only took 
one moment to take him away from us 
forever. 
Mr. Speaker, when I came to Con-
gress, I spoke to the Governor of our 
State, county and State leaders, hos-
pital administrators, direct providers,

and stakeholders across the country, 
from Georgia to Kentucky to North 
Dakota. I spoke to treatment services 
across my district: Awakenings Recov-
ery in Hagerstown; Fort Recovery in 
Cumberland; Ideal Option in Frederick; 
Wells/Robertson House in Montgomery 
County; and Brooke’s House in Hagers-
town. 
The message I heard from everyone 
was loud and clear: State, local, and 
Tribal governments need the Federal 
Government to be a steady partner in 
the fight against addiction. 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
PALLONE
and 
Ranking Member WALDEN of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, and 
the Energy Subcommittee on Health 
Chairwoman ESHOO and Ranking Mem-
ber BURGESS, for considering this bill. 
I also extend my sincere thanks to 
Freshmen Working Group on Addiction 
members KELLY
ARMSTRONG, MIKIE 
SHERRILL, and DENVER RIGGLEMAN for 
helping me introduce this bill. 
I want to take a moment to call out 
and thank Congressman RIGGLEMAN, 
who has been a fantastic member of 
our working group and a champion on 
this issue. He will be greatly missed in 
this institution. 
Together, the Freshmen Working 
Group on Addiction has introduced 
over 50 bipartisan bills to address ad-
diction and mental health in the last 2 
years. We have shown what is possible 
if you put aside partisan politics, focus 
on an issue, and work hard to make 
real change. 
Investing in this bill’s grants will 
save lives and save money. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want my friend from 
Maryland to know that we all are sym-
pathetic to what his family has gone 
through and the loss that he has suf-
fered. That is a very difficult story to 
tell. 
When we were working on all the leg-
islation in the last Congress, I met 
with a lot of families who had suffered 
similar fates, and it is just a tragedy. 
So I commend him for his work in a bi-
partisan way on this issue. 
And our friend from Virginia, Mr. 
RIGGLEMAN, who I am going to yield to, 
he has been a terrific legislator during 
his term in Congress and a good friend. 
I know how deeply he cares about this 
issue, and his willingness to work in a 
bipartisan way should be recognized by 
all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Virginia 
(Mr. 
RIGGLEMAN). 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, Representative 
WALDEN, Congressman PALLONE, and 
also DAVID TRONE. 
Our Freshman Working Group has 
been incredible on this issue. It is in-
teresting how it has come full circle. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, in my very 
first speech on the floor of the House of 
Representatives, I called on Congress 
to act and address the opioid addiction 
crisis that causes tens of thousands of 
deaths every year. During the 2 years 
since that speech, I have been working 
hard to provide solutions and take 
positive steps to address the crisis. 
I also have become more aware of the 
harm the opioid epidemic has caused in 
our streets and in our districts. I have 
seen how the crisis has affected the 
friends and the family members of so 
many, including some in this Chamber 
today, like my dear friend DAVID 
TRONE, who tragically lost his nephew 
to an opioid overdose. 
I have been personally affected by 
this crisis, and I know the toll it takes 
on those affected and the people who 
love them. I was sitting at my desk in 
Congress about 1 year ago when I got 
the call that my cousin Trey had 
overdosed, not far from where I was sit-
ting. I talked about this with Congress-
man TRONE. We knew we had to do 
something. 
I think that is why we have to thank 
Members like Representative SHERRILL 
and 
Representative 
ARMSTRONG
for 
their incredible support in this. 
Trey and Ian, I think this bill is for 
them and all the people who have suf-
fered through this incredible scourge. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today 
starts to address some of those chal-
lenges and is a positive step toward 
combating the very real crisis of opioid 
addiction that has had devastating 
consequences for families across this 
Nation. 
Obviously, I strongly support H.R. 
2466, the State Opioid Response Grant 
Authorization Act of 2020. Not only 
must Congress act to address this cri-
sis, but we must lead. I chose to colead 
this bill because it will help countless 
numbers of my constituents, and it is 
the right thing to do. But I have to ap-
plaud the efforts of my dear friend 
DAVID TRONE and all the members of 
the Freshmen Working Group on Ad-
diction. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. Again, I don’t think I 
can say this any stronger: This bill is 
for Trey and Ian, and this bill is for all 
those affected by the overdoses, the 
awfulness that happens within each 
family. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no additional 
speakers on this important legislation. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge my colleagues to support the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, America’s 
opioid crisis is far from resolved. 
According to the American Medical Associa-
tion, over 40 states have reported an increase 
in opioid overdose deaths since the beginning 
of the pandemic. 
Despite the steady decrease in opioid re-
lated deaths in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has intensified the opioid 
epidemic in Rhode Island. 
Opioid overdose remains the leading cause 
of accidental death in Rhode Island. 
In the first seven months of 2020, Rhode Is-
land experienced a 33 percent increase in 
overdose deaths compared to the same period 
last year. 
And every day we are at risk of losing more 
and more people to overdoses, with recent 
numbers showing that Black and Hispanic 
Rhode Islanders are disproportionately experi-
encing overdose related deaths. 
Over the years, State Opioid Response 
funding has been critical to responding to this 
deadly epidemic. This funding has helped to 
provide Rhode Islanders with adequate re-
sources to combat drug abuse and prevent 
overdoses before they turn deadly. 
State Opioid Response funding has allowed 
for more support and treatment for people suf-
fering from addiction to get the help they need 
and put them on a path toward recovery. 
This funding increases access to naloxone 
so that people in our communities are trained 
on identifying an opioid overdose and know 
how to stop the harmful effects of overdose. 
As we say in Rhode Island, ‘‘an overdose 
doesn’t mean it’s over. Naloxone saves lives.’’ 
State Opioid Response funding saves lives. 
While we continue to fight against the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we must also ensure 
that states’ are supported to continue their 
fight against the opioid epidemic. 
I thank Representative TRONE
for intro-
ducing H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act of 2020 to make sure 
we meet the needs of responding to the opioid 
epidemic in communities across this country. 
I urge my colleague to support this impor-
tant legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2466, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
EASY MEDICATION ACCESS AND 
TREATMENT FOR OPIOID ADDIC-
TION ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2281) to direct the Attorney Gen-
eral to amend certain regulations so 
that practitioners may administer not 
more than 3 days’ medication to a per-
son at one time when administering 
narcotic drugs for the purpose of re-
lieving acute withdrawal symptoms, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

November 17, 2020 
SEC. 2. DISPENSATION OF NARCOTIC DRUGS FOR 
THE PURPOSE OF RELIEVING ACUTE 
WITHDRAWAL 
SYMPTOMS 
FROM 
OPIOID USE DISORDER. 
Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Attorney General 
shall revise section 1306.07(b) of title 21, Code 
of Federal Regulations, so that practi-
tioners, in accordance with applicable State, 
Federal, or local laws relating to controlled 
substances, are allowed to dispense not more 
than a three-day supply of narcotic drugs to 
one person or for one person’s use at one 
time for the purpose of initiating mainte-
nance treatment or detoxification treatment 
(or both). 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2281. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2281, the Easy Medication Ac-
cess and Treatment for Opioid Addic-
tion Act, or the Easy MAT for Opioid 
Addiction Act. 
As we have highlighted on the floor 
today, the opioid epidemic is a public 
health emergency that we must con-
tinue to address. Millions of Americans 
have been impacted by the drug crisis. 
A 2019 National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health shows that 1.6 million 
Americans have an opioid use disorder. 
This is a chronic, treatable disease 
that patients can and do recover from. 
While the number of Americans with 
opioid use disorder was declining prior 
to the coronavirus pandemic, it is still 
alarming that less than one out of five 
of these Americans actually receive 
treatment. 
The Easy MAT for Opioid Addiction 
Act is a bill that makes it easier for 
patients to access medication-assisted 
treatment in the emergency room. For 
many patients, whether it be those ex-
periencing an overdose or those seek-
ing substance use disorder treatment, 
the emergency room can be the first or 
only point of care. 
Buprenorphine is one of three FDA- 
approved 
medications 
for 
treating 
opioid use disorder. In emergency situ-
ations, it may be dispensed from an 
emergency room by certain practi-
tioners for up to 3 days. This policy is 
otherwise known as the 3-day rule. 
This 
rule 
is 
intended 
to 
help 
healthcare 
providers 
address 
acute 
withdrawal symptoms while a patient 
awaits arrangements for longer term 
medication-assisted 
treatment. 
But, 
unfortunately, there are several bur-
densome restrictions tied to this au-
thority. For example, there is a limita-
tion that not more than 1 day’s medi-
cation be given to a patient at one 
time, forcing the repeated return to 
the emergency room. 
Mr. Speaker, in testimony before the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
Dr. Shawn Ryan, an emergency physi-
cian and addiction medicine specialist, 
cited the burden for a patient having to 
return to the emergency room after an 
initial visit, particularly for patients 
with substance use disorder. He stated 
that transportation can be an issue for 
these patients but also that repeat vis-
its can be a burden for the emergency 
departments. 
This bill would direct the Drug En-
forcement Administration to update 
regulations to allow a practitioner to 
dispense up to 3 days’ supply of 
buprenorphine. This will give patients 
and families a better opportunity to 
get connected to adequate treatment 
on the road to recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my col-
league, Representative RUIZ, a member 
of our committee, and his staff for 
leading this bill. I also thank Ranking 
Member WALDEN and his staff for work-
ing with us to move this bill forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense legislation 
that will help more substance use dis-
order patients access the treatment 
they need, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, November 16, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chair, Committee on Judiciary, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 2281, the 
Easy MAT for Opioid Addiction Act, so that 
the bill may proceed expeditiously to the 
House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 2281 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, November 16, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 2281, the ‘‘Easy Medica-
tion Access and Treatment for Opioid Addic-
tion Act,’’ that fall within our Rule X juris-
diction. I appreciate your consulting with us 
on those provisions. The Judiciary Com-
mittee has no objection to your including 
them in the bill for consideration on the 
House floor, and to expedite that consider-
ation is willing to forgo action on H.R. 2281, 
with the understanding that we do not there-
by waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over those provisions or their subject mat-
ters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2281, the Easy Medication Ac-
cess and Treatment, or Easy MAT, for 
Opioid Addiction Act, which was intro-
duced by myself and my Committee on 
Energy and Commerce colleague, Mr. 
RUIZ. 
Emergency room clinicians are well 
positioned to interact with those strug-
gling with opioid addiction and help 
transition them into treatment. Cur-
rently, an ER clinician who does not 
have a DATA 2000 waiver can only pro-
vide a 1-day supply of narcotic drugs to 
be used for medication-assisted treat-
ment to an individual at one time for a 
total of up to 3 days. 
What does that mean? It means that 
while the patient waits to get into 
treatment, they have to go back to 
that same clinician on each of those 3 
days to obtain medication. 
Now, in a rural district such as 
mine—which, by the way, is larger 
than the landmass of any State east of 
the Mississippi—this is not realistic, 
especially when there is already a 
shortage of health practitioners who 
are willing to treat patients with sub-
stance use disorder. 
One of my constituents, who I met in 
Hermiston, Oregon, told me she had to 
travel 5 hours—5 hours—just to find a 
physician 
who 
could 
oversee 
her 
Suboxone treatment because no one in 
her community was available to do 
that. 
H.R. 2281 would allow physicians to 
dispense up to 3 days of narcotic drugs 
at one time for purposes of relieving 
withdrawal symptoms while the indi-
vidual awaits arrangements for treat-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

November 17, 2020 
This is commonsense legislation, an-
other good product of the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no speakers at this time, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CURTIS), Utah’s Third Congres-
sional District. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2281, which is 
an important bill to help thousands of 
Americans who struggle with addic-
tion. 
This bipartisan, commonsense legis-
lation will give individuals greater ac-
cess to medication-assisted treatment, 
MAT, to help relieve withdrawal symp-
toms. 
Current law only allows providers to 
use this treatment once per day unless 
they have a waiver to prescribe the 
medication, and less than 10 percent of 
providers have that waiver. 
This is especially problematic be-
cause substance use disorder treatment 
programs can take days to accept new 
patients, leaving many individuals un-
able to gain access to immediate treat-
ment and, instead, leaving patients no 
choice but to return to the emergency 
room or the provider they received 
MAT from the day prior or, even worse, 
to take drugs again to stop their with-
drawal symptoms. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legisla-
tion puts the individual first and is 
part of a collaborative approach to 
combat addiction of all types. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their work on this important legis-
lation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, we have 
no speakers left on our side, so I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2117. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2117, the Food Allergy Safety, 
Treatment, Education, and Research 
Act, or the FASTER Act. 
Mr. Speaker, an estimated 32 million 
Americans, including approximately 1 
in every 13 children, are affected by 
food allergies. These allergies pose 
risks to millions of families, and these 
risks grow dramatically when inac-
curate labels fail to warn consumers 
about the presence of some of these al-
lergens. 
Under current law, eight allergens 
are considered major food allergens. 
They include milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, 
tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soy-
beans. Due to their status as major 
food allergens, manufacturers must 
clearly state the presence of any of 
these ingredients on labels. 
Notably missing from this list of al-
lergens is sesame. That is concerning, 
considering it is an allergen of growing 
concern and its inclusion in food prod-
ucts has more than doubled over the 
last decade. In some cases, sesame may 
not be listed at all on ingredient labels, 
being referred to instead through non-
specific terms like ‘‘flavors’’ or words 
that may not easily be recognized by 
consumers as containing sesame, such 
as tahini. 
While it may seem like a small issue 
to some, this lack of information could 
mean life or death for those who are al-
lergic to sesame. Clearly, this informa-
tion should be prominently featured on 
packaged food labels. 
This is an issue we have been work-
ing on for quite some time. Several 
years ago, I introduced a bill that 
would list sesame as a major food aller-
gen, and although the Food and Drug 
Administration opened a docket to so-
licit feedback about the sesame label-
ing and recently released guidance rec-
ommending voluntary labeling of ses-
ame, the agency has not been able to 
require the listing of sesame due to 
overly long regulatory processes. 
As we learn more about food aller-
gens, our regulations should be able to 
adapt to align with the latest science. 
This process should not take years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5814 
November 17, 2020 
Families should have reliable access to 
this information, and they should have 
it now. 
Today we are taking action, Mr. 
Speaker. 
The 
appropriately 
named 
FASTER Act would quickly move this 
process along by recognizing sesame as 
a major food allergen, requiring its 
listing on new food labels after a phase- 
in process. 
Importantly, the bill would also 
streamline processes at FDA to allow 
for additional allergens to be listed as 
major food allergens based on scientific 
criteria, including the prevalence and 
the severity of the allergens. 
The bill would also help develop qual-
ity research into food allergens by di-
recting the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention to expand and intensify 
its collection of data on food allergens 
and by directing FDA to report on its 
use of patient experience data. 
I want to thank Representative MAT-
SUI for her tireless efforts in support of 
families affected by food allergens and 
for introducing this bill. 
I am a strong supporter of the bill, 
and I encourage all Members to support 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2117, the Food Allergy 
Safety, Treatment, Education, and Re-
search Act. 
This legislation codifies sesame as a 
major food allergen. This means that, 
with enactment of the legislation, 
products containing sesame would have 
to list this ingredient on the food pack-
aging label. That is really important 
for consumers. 
Recent studies indicate that sesame 
allergies in the United States have a 
prevalence rate on par with the aller-
gies for soy and fish, which are both 
listed as major allergens under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
It is commonsense legislation. It pro-
vides consumers with important and, 
perhaps, even lifesaving information to 
protect themselves and their families 
from dangerous allergic reactions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. MATSUI), the sponsor of the 
legislation. 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of two of my bills 
being considered today: the FASTER 
Act and the MODERN Labeling Act. 
There are more than 32 million 
Americans living with potentially life- 
threatening food allergies who rely on 
accurate food ingredient labels to 
make safe decisions for themselves and 
their family members. 
Under current law, mandatory label-
ing is required for major food allergens 
recognized by the FDA, like milk, eggs, 
and peanuts. My grandson Robby has a 
peanut allergy, and for families like 
mine, checking food labels is as vital 
to our everyday lives as breathing. 
Unfortunately, FDA labeling require-
ments do not include the ingredient 
sesame, leaving more than 1.6 million 
Americans with a sesame allergy in the 
dark about what foods and products to 
avoid. That is why I have been working 
closely with my colleagues and advo-
cates in the food allergy community to 
advance the FASTER Act, legislation 
that updates food allergen labeling 
laws to include sesame. 
Importantly, the FASTER Act also 
lays 
critical 
groundwork 
for 
con-
ducting the research necessary to bet-
ter understand, treat, and, one day, 
prevent food allergies. 
From ingredients in a food product to 
the prescribing information for a pre-
scription drug, FDA labels play a crit-
ical role in protecting public health 
and empowering Americans to make 
safe decisions. 
This year, our friends in the cancer 
community brought a real problem to 
my attention. Despite the important 
role drug labels play in informing 
treatment 
decisions, 
many 
generic 
drug labels are considerably out of 
date, and there is no existing mecha-
nism to update these labels to reflect 
new clinical evidence. 
That is why I introduced the MOD-
ERN Labeling Act, legislation that 
supports FDA’s ability to require modi-
fications to outdated generic drug la-
bels so they reflect new, relevant infor-
mation. 
Accurate, up-to-date generic drug la-
bels are key to optimizing use, enhanc-
ing patient benefit, and facilitating 
greater use of lower cost generics. 
These are both important labeling 
laws, and both labeling bills are bipar-
tisan, 
commonsense 
solutions 
that 
take important steps to safeguard our 
public health. I urge my colleagues to 
support the FASTER Act and the MOD-
ERN Labeling Act. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 2117, the FASTER Act. I’m proud to 
have advanced this bipartisan bill through my 
Health Subcommittee and I’m proud to support 
it on the Floor today. 
The FASTER Act was introduced by Rep-
resentative DORIS MATSUI. It adds sesame as 
a major allergen for food labeling and allows 
the FDA, through regulation, to add other food 
ingredients as major allergens based on the 
prevalence and severity of allergic reactions to 
the food ingredient. 
The FASTER Act will have an enormous im-
pact on the 32 million Americans living with 
food allergies and their families. 
Hospitalizations for allergic reactions have 
risen 400 percent over the past decade with 1 
in 13 children having a life-threatening food al-
lergy, and many of them are allergic to ses-
ame. 
Sesame remains the most common allergen 
that is NOT required to be written on food la-
bels and is often hidden on labels as ‘‘Spices’’ 
or ‘‘Natural Flavors.’’ Parents and children 
cannot easily avoid sesame if it’s not clearly 
labeled. Anyone who’s ever known a child with 
a serious food allergy knows how dire a reac-
tion can be. 
Over a year ago, the FDA issued a request 
for information about requiring the sesame al-
lergen label and since then has only taken lim-
ited action to address this issue through draft 
guidance that would allow manufacturers to 
voluntarily list sesame as an ingredient. 
The FDA needs to do more to help curb the 
risks these children face and the FASTER Act 
will help the FDA do just that. I urge all my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2117, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO 
CYCLICAL VIOLENCE ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5855) to amend the Public Health

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5855. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, trauma is a pressing 
public health epidemic. In 2016 alone, 
trauma accounted for 29.2 million 
emergency department visits and 39.5 
million physician office visits in the 
U.S. 
Tragically, homicide is the leading 
cause of death for Black males 1 to 24 
years old and the second leading cause 
of death in Hispanic males 1 to 24 years 
old. 
Regardless of race, among those who 
survive a single violent trauma, it is 
estimated that up to 45 percent will ex-
perience a second violent trauma. This 
is where H.R. 5855 steps in to provide 
critical data-driven interventions. 
The Bipartisan Solution to Cyclical 
Violence Act of 2020 identifies patients 
at risk of repeat violent injury and 
connects them with hospital and com-
munity-based 
resources. 
The 
bill 
bridges tragedy with hospital-based vi-
olence intervention programs by pro-
viding intensive case management to 
individuals who have experienced at 
least one violent trauma. These pro-
grams have been shown to successfully 
reduce injury recidivism and help those 
at risk for violence live safer lives. 
I want to commend my colleagues, 
Representatives RUPPERSBERGER
and 
KINZINGER, for spearheading this initia-
tive and the University of Maryland 
Hospital for establishing its shock 
trauma unit, which established the 
first cycles of violence intervention 
program. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important bipartisan bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5855, the Bipartisan Solu-
tion to Cyclical Violence Act of 2020. 
I want to thank our colleagues, Rep-
resentatives 
RUPPERSBERGER
and 
KINZINGER, for putting forward a mean-
ingful solution to address violence in 
all of our communities. This legisla-
tion provides Federal grants to hos-
pitals and trauma centers for interven-
tion services for victims of violent 
crime. 
Violence in America disproportion-
ately impacts urban and underserved 
communities where poor social deter-
minants of health can contribute to 
structural 
violence. 
Hospital-based 
intervention programs help reduce vio-
lence because they reach high-risk in-
dividuals recently admitted to a hos-
pital for treatment of a serious violent 
injury. 
Hospitalization presents a unique 
and, frankly, teachable moment when 
an individual may be open to help, in 
turn, breaking the cycle of violence by 
immediate intervention. 
Currently, many hospitals are left 
with nothing but simply discharging 
gunshot injury patients without any 
strategy in place to reduce the risk of 
recidivism or retaliation. However, ac-
cording to the American College of 
Surgeons, those who received violence 
intervention at the hospital, Madam 
Speaker, were significantly less likely 
to be reinjured and to get involved in 
crime in the future. So it works. 
By supporting hospital-based vio-
lence intervention programs, this bill 
would help individuals at risk from be-
coming entangled in violent crime and 
connect them with local resources that 
address the underlying risk factors for 
violence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER), the 
sponsor of the legislation. 
(Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and 
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
RUPPERSBERGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan bill that will 
reduce the scourge of violence in Amer-
ica. 
The bill is based on a very simple 
concept: helping the victims of violent 
injury before they become repeat vic-
tims or even perpetrators themselves. 
We can do this by expanding hospital- 
based violence intervention programs 
around the country. 
I was inspired to write this bill after 
learning about the violence interven-
tion program at the University of 
Maryland R. Adams Cowley Shock 
Trauma Center. Maryland Shock Trau-
ma is considered one of the top trauma 
centers in the world. And, by the way, 
it helped save my life years ago. 
Shock Trauma has a staggering 20 
percent of patients who are the victims 
of violence, usually stabbings and 
shootings, that have occurred on the 
streets of Baltimore. Many of these pa-
tients are repeat customers, caught in 
a revolving door of violent reinjury. In 
fact, one of the leading risk factors for 
violent injury is a prior violent injury. 
Shock Trauma is taking advantage of 
the fact that these patients are a cap-
tive audience, confined to a bed and off 
the streets, if only for a few days.

November 17, 2020

Participants in their violence inter-
vention program, one of the 40 that 
now exist across the country, receive a 
brief intervention in the emergency 
room or at the hospital bedside. They 
get counseling and support that could 
include help with groceries, bus money, 
substance abuse treatment, job train-
ing or help finding affordable housing. 
This intervention is then followed by 
intensive community-based case man-
agement services in the months fol-
lowing the injury. At Shock Trauma, 
program participants have shown an 83 
percent decrease in rehospitalization 
due to intentional violent injury, and a 
75 percent reduction in criminal activ-
ity, and an 82 percent increase in em-
ployment. 
This bill that we have before us 
today, the Bipartisan Solution to Cy-
clical Violence Act, provides $10 mil-
lion in Federal grants to hospitals that 
want to create or expand violence pre-
vention programs. At the end of a 3- 
year pilot, each hospital will report its 
findings back to the Federal Govern-
ment. Awards will range from $250,000 
to $500,000. 
I believe, however, this bill will net 
cost savings to the American taxpayers 
by reducing violent crime, which costs 
more than $12 billion, from police, 
courts, and jails, to the medical ex-
penses of victims, to the lost wages to 
both victims and perpetrators. 
Further, as we engage in a national 
conversation about reimagining public 
safety, I think we need to do what we 
can to shift social work away from po-
lice and first responders and back to 
the experts in mental health, substance 
abuse, homelessness, unemployment, 
and other areas that often afflict vic-
tims of violent crime. 
In fact, when I first introduced this 
bill in 2019, it was endorsed by the Fra-
ternal Order of Police, the National As-
sociation of Resource Officers, and the 
National District Attorneys Associa-
tion. We also received endorsements 
from the NAACP, American College of 
Surgeons, Network of Hospital-Based 
Violence Intervention Programs, and 
the National League of Cities. It has 
also been endorsed by the National 
Hospital Association. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, 
ADAM KINZINGER, for coauthoring this 
important legislation; and Chairman 
FRANK PALLONE and Ranking Member 
WALDEN for helping us work through 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for the Bipartisan Solu-
tion to Cyclical Violence Act. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Maryland for his 
good work on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KINZINGER), who is a very talented leg-
islator. He has put a lot into this bill. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, 
the COVID pandemic has changed al-
most every aspect of American life. 
While it may be difficult to measure at 
this stage, we know the impact on 
medical health of Americans across the 
country is significant and it is alarm-
ing. 
In the age of technology and instant 
gratification, more and more people 
were already feeling less connected. 
But once the pandemic struck, the neg-
ative effects of isolation and uncer-
tainty were only compounded into a 
sense of hopelessness nationwide. If 
you don’t have hope, you have very lit-
tle reason to follow a moral code or 
fear the results of your actions. 
Hopelessness and desperation can be 
a dangerous trigger and it can lead to 
acts of violence. Unfortunately, vic-
tims of violence are often caught in a 
vicious cycle of violence, as one of the 
main risk factors for violent injury is a 
previous violent injury. 
My colleague, Congressman RUPPERS-
BERGER, and I introduced legislation to 
try and put a stop to this horrific cycle 
of violence, the Bipartisan Solution to 
Cyclical Violence Act. Our legislation 
establishes a grant program at the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices to award grants to existing and as-
piring violence intervention programs. 
These programs intervene while a 
victim is still in the hospital recov-
ering from their injuries, and provide a 
wide range of services like counseling, 
substance abuse treatment, job train-
ing, or even assistance finding afford-
able housing. And it doesn’t stop when 
the victim walks out of the hospital. 
The intervention continues for several 
months, and sometimes even up to a 
year following the initial incident. 
The successes of these programs have 
been astounding. At the University of 
Maryland 
Medical 
System, 
partici-
pants showed an 83 percent decrease in 
rehospitalization due to intentional 
violent injury, and a 75 percent reduc-
tion in criminal activity, and an 82 per-
cent increase in employment. These 
programs really work. 
By supporting victims with the re-
sources and education to pursue a dif-
ferent path, we can stop the vicious 
cycle of violence and give people hope 
for a better tomorrow. It is more im-
portant than ever that we work to-
gether to help and heal those who are 
struggling. 
I remain committed to finding com-
monsense and bipartisan solutions to 
problems facing our country, and the 
Bipartisan Solution to Cyclical Vio-
lence Act is a perfect example of how 
we can work together to enact policies 
that will have real and lasting impact 
in our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER for work-
ing on this important bipartisan legis-
lation. I also thank the chairman and 
the ranking member for bringing this 
up and your help with that. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no more speakers on our side of 
the aisle. I urge passage of the bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge all of my colleagues to sup-

the balance of my time.

yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3878, the Block, Report, 
And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act 
of 2020. This bill will improve reporting 
an action on suspicious orders on con-
trolled substances. 
Between 1999 and 2017, more than 
700,000 Americans died from a drug 
overdose. Many of those Americans 
were caught in the first wave of what 
we typically describe as three waves of 
this epidemic. 
This first wave began in the 1990s 
with 
deaths 
involving 
prescription 
opioids. In 2010, we saw dramatic in-
creases from heroin-involved deaths. 
And most recently, we are seeing a 
third wave involving synthetic opioids, 
like illicitly manufactured fentanyl. 
During that first wave, Americans 
across the country became addicted to 
opioids. Many of those opioids were 
prescribed to patients to treat pain. 
However, throughout the years, we 
have discovered that many of these 
opioids were diverted through a system 
meant to prevent diversion. 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion requires entities that manufacture 
or distribute controlled substances to 
register and report their activities 
through ARCOS. This system is meant 
to track the manufacture, distribution, 
and dispensing of these substances. In 
this system, registrants are also ex-
pected to disclose suspicious orders of 
controlled substances, such as orders of 
unusual size, orders deviating from a 
normal pattern, or orders of unusual 
frequency. 
As an effort to improve reporting and 
action on suspicious orders, this bill 
would clarify the responsibilities of 
drug manufacturers and distributors 
when discovering a suspicious order, 
and require communications around 
that order to DEA. This will help all 
entities to better identify suspicious 
activity and root out bad actors. 
Madam Speaker, this is a common-
sense bill that will make clear the re-
sponsibilities for all entities in our 
supply chain and, hopefully, help to 
deter opioid diversion and trafficking. I 
commend the lead sponsors of this bi-
partisan bill, Representatives DINGELL 
and MCKINLEY, and their staff for their 
work on this legislation. I also thank 
the Democratic and Republican mem-
bers of our committee, as well as bipar-
tisan staff for working together to 
move this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3878, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Hon. JERROLD NADLER,

DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 3878, the 
Block, Report, and Suspend Suspicious Ship-
ments Act of 2020, so that the bill may pro-
ceed expeditiously to the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3878 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, November 16, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 3878, the ‘‘Block, Report, 
And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 
2019,’’ that fall within our Rule jurisdiction. 
I appreciate your consulting with us on 
those provisions. The Judiciary Committee 
has no objection to your including them in 
the bill for consideration on the House floor, 
and to expedite that consideration is willing 
to forgo action on H.R. 3878, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support H.R. 3878, the Block, Report, 
And Suspend Suspicious Shipments 
Act, which was led by my Energy and 
Commerce Committee colleagues, Rep-
resentatives MCKINLEY and DINGELL. 
This legislation addresses an alarm-
ing problem that was identified in the 
committee’s 2018 bipartisan investiga-
tion in the distribution of prescription 
opioids by wholesale drug distributors. 
The committee found that when mil-
lions 
of 
prescription 
opioids 
were 
dumped into communities, large and 
small, across the country, the distribu-
tors flagged the orders for the DEA, 
but shipped the orders anyway, even 
after notifying the authorities that the 
orders were suspicious. 
H.R. 3878 would place additional com-
monsense obligations on drug manufac-
turers and distributors who discover a 
controlled substance suspicious order. 
In addition to reporting the suspicious 
order to the DEA, this legislation re-
quires the manufacturer or distributor 
to exercise due diligence, to decline to 
fill the order, and to provide informa-
tion to the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration on the indicators that led to 
the belief that filling the order would 
violate the Substances Controlled Act. 
We all have a part to play in the 
fight against the opioid epidemic, and 
it is critical that pharmaceutical man-
ufacturers and distributors step up in 
stopping pill dumping. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues, Representatives DINGELL and 
MCKINLEY, for their extra effort on this 
legislation. It is a fine piece of work 
moving forward, and I commend them 
for their work. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t believe I 
have any speakers on this one, so I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), the 
Democratic sponsor of the bill. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Block, Report, 
And Suspend Suspicious Shipments 
Act, which would crack down on pill 
dumping and other abusive practices to 
address the ongoing opioid epidemic, 
which still remains one of the most sig-
nificant public health challenges facing 
our country. 
In 2018, over 67,000 Americans still 
lost their lives to drug overdoses, and 
preliminary data for 2019 suggests that 
deaths are rising again. 
My home State of Michigan has been 
hit hard by the opioid epidemic, which 
has been exacerbated by COVID–19. We 
have seen a 15 percent year-over-year 
increase in fatal overdoses across the 
entire State since March of this year.

and other dodgy practices that have

perpetuated the opioid crisis are need-
ed more now than ever. The Block, Re-
port, And Suspend Suspicious Ship-
ments Act will crack down on these 
abuses. It will improve oversight of the 
opioid supply chain by mandating that 
the drug manufacturers and distribu-
tors exercise due diligence when they 
receive a suspicious order for con-
trolled substances. This includes block-
ing or declining to fill the suspicious 
order, and providing the DEA with ad-
ditional data and background on the 
indicators on the order in question. 
Distributors 
and 
manufacturers 
should be active partners in addressing 
these abuses, and this legislation’s 
commonsense protections will save 
lives in Michigan and the country. 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize 
my colleague, Congressman MCKINLEY, 
for his years of leadership and work in 
highlighting this issue and driving ac-
tion to address the role bad actors con-
tinue to play in perpetuating the 
opioid crisis. I also thank Chairman 
PALLONE and Ranking Member WAL-
DEN, who I am going to miss greatly, as 
well as the Democratic and Republican 
committee staff for working tirelessly 
to advance this important bipartisan 
priority. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 3878. While Congress has un-
derstandably been focused on the COVID–19 
pandemic, the opioid epidemic has not gone 
away. In fact, across the nation overdose 
deaths are up 13 percent from this time last 
year. 
In West Virginia, nearly twice as many peo-
ple have died from drug abuse than from 
COVID. 
Last Congress, the Energy and Commerce 
Committee conducted an investigation that 
found massive evidence of pill dumping. One 
example in the report was that nearly 9 million 
pills were distributed in just two years to a sin-
gle pharmacy in West Virginia. Finally, two 
years later we’re passing legislation that would 
help address the problem. 
I am proud to work with Mrs. DINGELL on 
this nonpartisan bill. The Block, Report, and 
Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act would re-
quire drug wholesalers and manufacturers to 
report and stop unusually large orders. We are 
hopeful this bill will be another positive step in 
addressing America’s opioid epidemic. 
I urge my colleagues to support the pas-
sage of H.R. 3878. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3878, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DEBARMENT 
ENFORCEMENT 
OF 
BAD ACTOR REGISTRANTS ACT 
OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4806) to amend the Controlled 
Substances Act to authorize the debar-
ment of certain registrants, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H. R. 4806 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Debarment 
Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants Act of 
2020’’ or the ‘‘DEBAR Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. DEBARMENT OF CERTAIN REGISTRANTS. 
Section 304 of the Controlled Substances 
Act (21 U.S.C. 824) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(h) The Attorney General may issue an 
order to prohibit, conditionally or uncondi-
tionally, and permanently or for such period 
as the Attorney General may determine, any 
person from being registered under this title 
to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a 
controlled substance or a list I chemical, if 
the Attorney General finds that— 
‘‘(1) such person meets or has met any of 
the conditions for suspension or revocation 
of registration under subsection (a); and 
‘‘(2) such person has a history of prior sus-
pensions or revocations of registration.’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4806. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4806, 
the Debarment Enforcement of Bad 
Actor Registrants Act of 2020, or the 
DEBAR Act of 2020, which gives the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, or 
the DEA, additional tools to go after 
bad actors. 
The DEA is charged with enforcing 
and implementing policies to protect 
public health and safety through the 
Controlled Substances Act. 
One important lever DEA has at its 
disposal to manage diversion or non-
compliance with the law is the ability 
to revoke or surrender an individual’s 
CSA registration, which is needed to 
handle controlled substances. While 
this is an important tool, a recent De-
partment of Justice Office of the In-
spector General report found weak-
nesses in DEA’s registration process 
and instances where the agency did not 
fully utilize its regulatory authorities 
to address noncompliance. Specifically, 
the 
inspector 
general 
found 
cases 
where entities have been able to obtain 
a new license after having one that was 
revoked. 
For example, the report outlined a 
case that included a doctor who was 
engaged in serious misconduct and had 
his registration revoked, who then 
moved to another State under the au-
thority of a different DEA field divi-
sion. When the doctor reapplied for reg-
istration, it was granted. 
Another example, Madam Speaker, in 
the report included a dentist who had 
voluntarily surrendered his medical li-
cense and DEA registration on two sep-
arate occasions. The dentist also had 
been convicted of a felony, which is 
grounds for suspension or revocation of 
an individual’s registration under the 
CSA. However, according to DEA, the 
dentist was still able to obtain another 
DEA registration. 
Now, these errors by the DEA are 
simply unacceptable, Madam Speaker. 
Today, we are considering H.R. 4806, 
which would address these errors. The 
legislation would authorize the debar-
ment of any registrant that either 
meets the criteria for temporary or 
permanent suspension or revocation or 
has a history of prior suspension or 
revocations. 
Again, I thank my colleague Rep-
resentative LATTA for leading this leg-
islation and Ranking Member WALDEN 
and his staff for working with me on 
this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4806, the De-
barment Enforcement of Bad Actor 
Registrants, or DEBAR Act, which was 
introduced by Energy and Commerce 
Communications and Technology Sub-
committee leader BOB LATTA. He spoke 
to this legislation earlier on a different 
bill and had a commitment now that 
precludes him from being here as this 
bill comes up. 
This legislation would give the Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration 
debar-
ment authority to prohibit a person 
who has repeatedly violated the Con-
trolled Substances Act from being able 
to receive a registration to manufac-
ture, distribute, or dispense a con-
trolled substance. 
A recent Justice Department Office 
of Inspector General report found that 
certain bad actor registrants who had 
their registration revoked were able to 
simply reapply for registration the day 
after the enforcement action or reg-
istration surrender occurred. As a re-
sult, registrants who pose a significant 
risk of diverting drugs are actually 
given an opportunity to do it again. 
Repeat offenders should not be able to 
get away with a new registration from 
the DEA just days after the suspension 
of the old one. Limited debarment au-
thority is a commonsense and effective 
administrative tool to address diver-
sion, fraud, and misconduct. 
I strongly support Mr. LATTA’s legis-
lation and I thank my colleague, the 
chairman of the committee, for his 
work on this, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my

Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I,

I yield back the balance of my time.

ENSURING COMPLIANCE AGAINST 
DRUG DIVERSION ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4812) to amend the Controlled 
Substances Act to provide for the 
modification, transfer, and termination 
of a registration to manufacture, dis-
tribute, or dispense controlled sub-
stances or list I chemicals, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H. R. 4812 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring 
Compliance Against Drug Diversion Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. MODIFICATION, TRANSFER, AND TERMI-
NATION OF REGISTRATION TO MAN-
UFACTURE, 
DISTRIBUTE, 
OR 
DIS-
PENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. 
Subsection (a) of section 302 of the Con-
trolled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 822) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new paragraph: 
‘‘(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph 
(C), the registration of any registrant under 
this title to manufacture, distribute, or dis-
pense controlled substances or list I chemi-
cals terminates if and when such reg-
istrant— 
‘‘(i) dies; 
‘‘(ii) ceases legal existence; 
‘‘(iii) discontinues business or professional 
practice; or 
‘‘(iv) surrenders such registration. 
‘‘(B) In the case of such a registrant who 
ceases legal existence or discontinues busi-
ness or professional practice, such registrant 
shall promptly notify the Attorney General 
in writing of such fact. 
‘‘(C) No registration under this title to 
manufacture, distribute, or dispense con-
trolled substances or list I chemicals, and no 
authority conferred thereby, may be as-
signed or otherwise transferred except upon 
such conditions as the Attorney General 
may specify and then only pursuant to writ-
ten consent. A registrant to whom a reg-
istration is assigned or transferred pursuant 
to the preceding sentence may not manufac-
ture, distribute, or dispense controlled sub-
stances or list I chemicals pursuant to such 
registration until the Attorney General re-
ceives such written consent. 
‘‘(D) In the case of a registrant under this 
title to manufacture, distribute, or dispense 
controlled substances or list I chemicals de-
siring to discontinue business or professional 
practice altogether or with respect to con-
trolled substances and list I chemicals (with-
out assigning or transferring such business

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4812. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE: Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4812, 
the Ensuring Compliance Against Drug 
Diversion Act. 
As I have already mentioned, the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, or 
DEA, has an established registration 
system for controlled substances, in-
cluding opioids. This system is meant 
to identify entities that manufacture, 
distribute, and dispense these sub-
stances, as well as to prevent diversion 
of these substances. We rely on the 
DEA to maintain the integrity of this 
system as one way to stop illicit diver-
sion before it starts. 
However, a 2016 Government Ac-
countability Office report found over 
700 registrants in DEA’s system may 
have been ineligible to have controlled 
substance registrations. GAO found 
that the registrants were reportedly 
deceased, did not possess State level 
authority, or were incarcerated for of-
fenses related to controlled substances. 
This bill terminates the controlled 
substance registration of any reg-
istrant if the registrant dies, ceases 
legal existence, discontinues business 
or professional practice, or surrenders

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, November 16, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 4812, the ‘‘Ensuring Com-
pliance Against Drug Diversion Act of 2019,’’ 
that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I ap-
preciate your consulting with us on those 
provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no 
objection to your including them in the bill 
for consideration on the House floor, and to 
expedite that consideration is willing to 
forgo action on H.R. 4812, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4812, 
the Ensuring Compliance Against Drug 
Diversion Act spearheaded by Energy 
and Commerce Committee colleague 
Representative MORGAN
GRIFFITH. I 
thank Mr. GRIFFITH for his leadership 
on this and many other pieces of legis-
lation. 
This legislation addresses a policy 
issue that was identified again in our 
2018 Energy and Commerce Committee 
report summarizing the committee’s 
bipartisan investigation into the dis-
tribution of prescription opioids by 
wholesale drug distributors and subse-
quent enforcement practices by the 
DEA. 
The investigative report that we 
issued found that an opioid distributor 
and its pharmacy customer did not go 
through the appropriate process of 
transferring a registration to a new 
pharmacy owner. This is disturbing, 
because failing to appropriately con-
tact the DEA and verify whether the 
agency approved the transfer of a reg-
istration to dispense controlled sub-
stances creates a serious risk that 
could lead to drug diversion. 
In order to prevent people who have 
not been vetted by the authorities from 
dispensing controlled substances, H.R. 
4812 makes clear that the transfer of 
any controlled substance registration 
without written consent from the DEA 
will be prohibited. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no speakers at this time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
GRIFFITH), who has been a real work-
horse on this and many other pieces of 
legislation. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4812, the 
Ensuring Compliance Against Drug Di-
version Act. 
This is a small but very important 
step that could play a key role in help-
ing contain the opioid epidemic. 
License to distribute opioids is not a 
commodity to be freely bought and 
sold. Those who wish to distribute 
opioids must earn the ability to do so. 
An investigation performed by the 
Energy and Commerce Oversight and 
Investigations 
Subcommittee 
found 
that the current process of transferring 
controlled substance dispensation li-
censes does not create sufficient ac-
countability. 
In the one instance you heard about 
before, a distributor and its pharmacy 
customer did not go through the appro-
priate process of transferring registra-
tion to a new pharmacy owner, but the 
mistake wasn’t caught until long after-
ward. As a result, there was a period of 
time during which the DEA was un-
aware that particular pharmacy was 
distributing controlled substances. 
Now, in this case, as best I under-
stand it, there was not a rogue indi-
vidual, it was just a matter of an over-
sight. But what we are trying to do 
with this bill today is to make sure 
that in the future we don’t have some 
rogue individual that comes in and 
buys somebody else’s business or their 
license 
or 
their 
registration 
and 
doesn’t go back to the DEA to get 
proper registration. 
Failing to appropriately contact the 
DEA and verify whether the agency ap-
proved a transfer creates a serious risk 
of drug diversion, and this bill amends 
the Controlled Substances Act to pro-
hibit that transfer of any DEA reg-
istration without written consent from 
the agency. 
By requiring written approval from 
the DEA before the transfer of registra-
tion occurs, we decrease the risk of 
drug diversion by keeping controlled 
substances out of the hands of people 
that have not been vetted by the appro-
priate regulatory authorities. 
Madam Speaker, that is the purpose 
of the bill. I appreciate everyone’s sup-
port on it. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
again thank the gentleman from Vir-
ginia for his leadership on this and so 
much other legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support of this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4812, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 6096. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6096, 
the Reliable Emergency Alert Distribu-
tion Improvement Act of 2020, or the 
READI Act, as it is known. 
In times of crisis, Americans rely on 
communication systems to stay in-
formed, check on loved ones, and ac-
cess emergency assistance. Emergency 
alerts, in particular, are an effective 
mechanism for relaying lifesaving in-
formation to the American public in an 
instant. 
The emergency alert system, or EAS, 
is one tool we have to issue such mes-
sages. Typically, an EAS message is 
originated by officials 
from 
local, 
State, Tribal, or Federal governments, 
known as alerting authorities. The 
messages are disseminated to the pub-
lic by operators of broadcast cable and 
satellite TV or radio. 
b 1345 
The Wireless Emergency Alert sys-
tem, or WEA, on the other hand, allows 
emergency managers and other alert 
originators to distribute geographi-
cally targeted emergency messages to 
wireless customers’ devices at a mo-
ment’s notice. 
Over recent months, Madam Speaker, 
local and State officials in California 
and Oregon have used geo-targeted 
emergency alerts to inform residents 
about wildfires and evacuation orders. 
Simply put, our emergency alerting 
systems save lives, but there is plenty 
of room for improvement. 
My colleagues may recall an incident 
that took place in Hawaii in January 
2018 when the Hawaii Emergency Man-
agement Agency mistakenly issued an 
emergency alert through the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency’s In-
tegrated Public Alert and Warning Sys-
tem. 
The alert warned the public of an in-
bound 
ballistic 
missile 
threat, 
al-
though there was no such threat. It 
was intended to be a routine test of the 
system, but the supervising officer who 
dictated the language of the drill mis-
takenly included the phrase, ‘‘This is 
not a drill,’’ causing confusion among 
the shift officers responsible for trans-
mitting the alert to the public. 
With five words, Hawaii was sent into 
a frenzy, which lasted about 38 min-
utes, until a follow-up notice was sent 
out correcting the error. 
Now, there are more than 1,000 alert-
ing 
authorities 
across 
the 
United 
States that rely on emergency alerting 
systems to notify the public of every-
thing from law enforcement situations 
to evacuation and stay-at-home orders, 
child abductions, and natural disasters. 
While 
the 
Hawaii 
incident 
was 
deemed an accident caused by human 
error, it is clear that there are gaps 
that must be addressed, and that is 
what this bill does. 
The READI Act will ensure that 
there is better coordination between 
the Federal agencies that deal with 
emergency communications and their 
partners at the State and local levels. 
Specifically, the bill calls on the Fed-
eral Communications Commission to 
work with State Emergency Commu-
nications Committees to develop and

update State plans to identify and 
close any gaps in protocol or account-
ability. 
The READI Act also requires the 
FCC to study and report to Congress on 
the feasibility of expanding participa-
tion in the Emergency Alert System to 
include streaming services and internet 
platforms and whether such an action 
would increase the reach and reli-
ability of emergency alerts. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Rep-
resentative JERRY MCNERNEY for his 
leadership on this bill, especially as his 
constituents and neighbors all across 
California continue to grapple with the 
fallout from these historic wildfires. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank Rank-
ing Member WALDEN and subcommittee 
Ranking Member LATTA for working 
with 
us 
to 
move 
this 
legislation 
through the Energy and Commerce 
Committee on a bipartisan basis. 
Finally, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
also 
thank Senator SCHATZ, who is leading 
this legislation in the Senate. 
This is a really good bill that will 
make emergency alerts more effective 
and reliable, to keep our friends and 
neighbors safe when it matters most. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the READI Act, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

DEAR
MR. PALLONE: I write concerning 
H.R. 6096, the READI Act. There are certain 
provisions in this legislation that fall within 
the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. 
In order to expedite floor consideration of 
H.R. 6096, the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on 
the bill. However, this is conditional on our 
mutual understanding that forgoing consid-
eration of the bill would not prejudice the 
Committee with respect to the appointment 
of conferees or to any future jurisdictional 
claim over the subject matters contained in 
the bill or similar legislation that fall within 
the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I also 
request that you urge the Speaker to name 
members of this Committee to any con-
ference committee which is named to con-
sider such provisions. 
Please place a copy of this letter and your 
response acknowledging our jurisdictional 
interest into the committee report on H.R. 
6096 and into the Congressional Record dur-
ing consideration of the measure on the 
House floor. 
Sincerely, 
PETER DEFAZIO,

COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, November 13, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 6096, the 
Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Im-
provement (READI) Act of 2020, so that the 
bill may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 6096 
into the committee report on the bill and 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 6096, the 
READI Act. This legislation will help 
improve the Federal Communications 
Commission’s oversight over the wire-
less and broadcast emergency alert sys-
tems, something that is much needed 
in a new age of communication. 
This year, our Nation was hit by hor-
rific and deadly wildfires that de-
stroyed entire communities. My dis-
trict and many parts of Oregon wit-
nessed this situation with catastrophic 
fires that moved very, very rapidly, 
caused incredible and historic destruc-
tion, and will take years for people to 
recover. 
Our Emergency Alert System is so 
important during these times, and we 
need to make sure it delivers for Amer-
icans when they need it most. In some 
parts of my State, it worked flawlessly. 
In other parts, they are reviewing what 
worked and what didn’t work. 
I daresay I am probably the only 
Member of Congress who actually has 
wired in Emergency Alert System com-
ponents because we used to own radio 
stations. So I have pushed the buttons, 
and I have done the alerts, all of that. 
I know how important that coordina-
tion is and how important it is to work 
together ahead of time to really under-
stand the plans and who triggers what 
and how it works going forward. Be-
cause when the emergencies do hit, 
there isn’t time to come up with a 
plan. You need to have that in place. 
This bill will help establish State 
Emergency Communications Commit-
tees, develop Emergency Alert System 
plans, and coordinate those plans with 
the FCC. This type of coordination al-
lows States the independence to tailor 
their plans to their specific needs and 
to alert citizens during emergencies 
that are specific to their localities. 
However, the bill also allows the FCC 
to review the plans to ensure States 
and other localities have considered 
any necessary technical issues so that 
there is consistency across the plans in 
the case of multistate or national 
emergencies. 
Importantly, this bill requires co-
ordination not only with the experts on 
telecommunications 
technology 
but 
also with the experts on emergency 
management, FEMA. The FCC will en-
sure State plans have considered the 
necessary 
technical 
requirements, 
while FEMA ensures consistency re-
garding the types of emergency alerts. 
This type of State and national co-
ordination will make sure that all 
Americans receive alerts during emer-
gencies and that those alerts make 
sense, and that will no doubt save lives 
and property. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I am 
happy to support this forward-looking 
bill to improve the Emergency Alert 
System management at all levels, and 
I urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
I would just close my comments with 
a brief story about one of these prac-
tice emergency sessions in my home-
town on a Saturday morning. It was a 
full-fledged one. All the various re-
sources in the area were to be engaged. 
The theory was that one of the 
mainstem Columbia River dams had 
breached and that there would be mas-
sive flooding. So, that was kind of the 
idea: What do you do in a mass cas-
ualty situation like that? 
Fortunately, 
the 
gentleman 
who 
worked Saturday mornings at our local 
radio station had been around the 
block a few times. He was actually a 
retiree who just liked working, doing 
an old radio show on Saturday morn-
ings. When they got the call and told 
him he needed to trigger the Emer-
gency Alert System because Bonneville 
Dam had been breached, he said, 
‘‘Okay. I understand that is the prac-
tice, but I am not going to actually go 
on air and say the dam has been 
breached.’’ 
Because he had been around a little 
bit, he pushed back on the emergency 
folks who were going by the letter of 
the plan and decided not to create one 
of these events like occurred in Hawaii 
by saying, ‘‘I don’t think we really 
want to say that, even though this is a 
practice.’’ I think we headed off prob-
ably a little bit of a problem there. 
Madam Speaker, this is important, 
and these plans are important. I thank 
my colleagues for their work on this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCNERNEY), the spon-
sor of the legislation and a member of 
our committee. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of my legisla-
tion, H.R. 6096, the READI Act. 
The emergency alerting system and 
the wireless emergency alerting system 
provide safe, lifesaving tools to dis-
seminate information during emer-
gencies. 
In recent years, we have seen dev-
astating fires in my home State of 
California, including the Tubbs fire; 
the Camp fire, which was the deadliest 
wildfire our Nation has faced in the 
last century; and the Kincade fire. 
This year, we have seen some of the 
largest and most devastating fires in

H5823 
November 17, 2020 
the State’s history, with a record of 
more than 4 million acres burned and 
more than 8,100 fires across the State. 
Nearly every part of the great State of 
California 
has 
been 
touched 
by 
wildfires this season. These events 
demonstrate that we must improve the 
reliability of emergency alerts. 
As we continue to battle COVID–19, 
this year’s wildfire season has also pre-
sented unprecedented challenges for 
firefighters, emergency managers, and 
the public, particularly when it comes 
to evacuations. This makes it even 
more crucial that we have emergency 
alerting systems in place that are both 
robust and reliable. 
This legislation will improve the cur-
rent wireless emergency alerting sys-
tem, and emergency alerting systems 
more broadly, so that my constituents 
and Americans across the country can 
count on receiving these alerts when 
faced 
with 
emergencies, 
including 
wildfires. 
H.R. 6096 will ensure that more peo-
ple receive critical emergency alerts on 
their mobile devices, televisions, and 
radios, and will pave the way for exam-
ining the feasibility of issuing alerts 
through online audio and video stream-
ing services. 
Additionally, this legislation will 
help States improve their plans for 
emergency alerting, and it will estab-
lish a reporting system for false alerts. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues, including Representative BILI-
RAKIS, Mr. OLSON, and Ms. GABBARD, 
for working with me on the READI 
Act, as well as Senators SCHATZ and 
THUNE for their leadership on this leg-
islation in the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank Chair-
man PALLONE
and Ranking Member 
WALDEN, and Chairman DOYLE
and 
Ranking Member LATTA, for their 
working with me to move this legisla-
tion through the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6096. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS), a State that has dealt with a 
lot of disasters over the years and will 
in the future, to talk about this impor-
tant legislation. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the time very much. 
This legislation builds upon the 
IPAWS Modernization Act, which I au-
thored and which became law in 2016. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCNER-
NEY), the chairman of the committee, 
and the ranking member. It has been a 
great pleasure to serve with all of them 
on this committee, and I want to con-
tinue to serve on this committee. It is 
the best committee in Congress, as far 
as I am concerned, the original com-
mittee. 
That bill enhanced the Nation’s 
emergency alert texting system and 
implemented training programs for 
States. I am talking about the IPAWS 
Modernization Act, Madam Speaker. 
The READI Act builds upon our prior 
efforts and will ensure more people re-
ceive critical emergency alerts on their 
mobile phones, televisions, and radios. 
It really works well, Madam Speaker. 
I am from the great State of Florida, 
and we had hurricane warnings for the 
last couple of weeks for Eta. I was on 
the other coast, the east coast, even 
though I represent the west coast, vis-
iting friends on the east coast, and I 
got the alert on the east coast even 
though the threat was on the west 
coast. So, you know, you have to have 
planning. And it really works very 
well. It saves so many lives. 
It also paves the way for examining 
the feasibility of issuing alerts through 
online streaming services, an ever-pop-
ular platform, I understand. 
Even more importantly, this bill will 
help States improve emergency alert 
plans and establish reporting systems 
for false alerts. 
I am pleased that this potentially 
lifesaving legislation has come to a 
floor vote. The effectiveness and accu-
racy of information during an emer-
gency should always be a top priority, 
and it is. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t believe I have any other speakers 
on our side of the aisle on this legisla-
tion, so I would urge its passage. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I ask my 
colleagues to support the legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6096, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 6624. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6624, 
the USA Telecommunications Act. 
Earlier this year, the House passed, 
and the President signed, my Secure 
and 
Trusted 
Communications 
Net-
works Act to create a program to fund 
the replacement of suspect network 
equipment. Suspect equipment, includ-
ing that produced by Huawei and ZTE, 
could allow foreign adversaries to sur-
veil Americans at home or, worse, dis-
rupt our communications systems. 
While we are still pushing for Con-
gress to appropriate funds to that end, 
it is important to recognize that my 
legislation was only half the battle, 
even when it is funded. We also need to 
create and foster competition for trust-
ed network equipment that uses open 
interfaces so that the United States is 
not beholden to a market for network 
equipment that is becoming less com-
petitive. 
b 1400 
This bill before us today, the Uti-
lizing Strategic Allied Telecommuni-
cations Act, or the USA Telecommuni-
cations Act, does just that. 
The bipartisan legislation creates a 
grant program and authorizes $750 mil-
lion in funding for the National Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration to help promote and de-
ploy Open Radio Access Network tech-
nologies that can spur that type of 
competition. We must support alter-
natives to companies like Huawei and 
ZTE, Madam Speaker. 
Today, most network equipment is 
produced by a handful of companies 
that provide a soup-to-nuts solution, 
locking our networks into one single 
vendor at a time. That makes it hard 
for new competitors to break into the 
market. 
Currently, there are no American 
vendors for the network equipment 
that fuels our wireless economy. How-
ever, this legislation would authorize 
the funding of grants to support the 
promotion and deployment of Open 
Radio Access Network equipment. 
By using standardized open inter-
faces, this type of equipment will allow 
network operators in the U.S. to piece 
together wireless networks that are 
both secure and make sense for them. 
And because of that, many American 
companies will be able to work directly 
with our network providers, hopefully 
spurring a domestic market for net-
work equipment, and that is something 
we desperately need. 
For all of these reasons, I want to 
thank Representatives GUTHRIE
and 
MATSUI and Ranking Member WALDEN 
for joining me in leading this bipar-
tisan, bicameral bill. I also want to 
thank the Senate sponsors, led by Sen-
ator WARNER of Virginia. 
This legislation is critical for our 
strategic national interest, and I urge 
all Members to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today to urge passage of H.R. 
6624, 
the 
USA 
Telecommunications 
Act. This bill will help put the United 
States at the helm of network security, 
ensuring that communications pro-
viders have a secure, diverse, and com-
petitive marketplace of trusted equip-
ment suppliers for their next-genera-
tion networks. 
Until now, most network providers 
have relied on a small set of trusted 
suppliers 
to 
build 
their 
networks. 
While these suppliers have done a tre-
mendous job, they face increased pres-
sure from untrusted Chinese suppliers 
who are handpicked and encouraged by 
the Chinese Communist Party to sig-
nificantly undercut the network equip-
ment marketplace by offering nearly 
free equipment. 
As a result of this unfair competi-
tion, trusted suppliers have increas-
ingly relied upon proprietary soup-to- 
nuts offerings to survive. But under the 
soup-to-nuts model, once a network 
provider selects a vendor, the provider 
must use the same vendor for all of the 
hardware and software across its net-
work. 
Well, this model is simply not sus-
tainable, Madam Speaker. If we want 
the United States to continue to have 
access to trusted, affordable commu-
nications equipment that can with-
stand state-sponsored attempts to un-
dermine our security, then we have to 
act. 
This model results in an expensive 
and timely process to upgrade equip-
ment and software for the next-genera-
tion 5G networks. 
Furthermore, competing for a small 
set of contracts in a limited market-
place, while simultaneously trying to 
fight off untrusted state-sponsored ven-
dors, has also resulted in significant 
losses to research, development, and 
innovation. 
So Congress needs to act. We need to 
do all we can to ensure the United 
States supports capitalism and com-
petition among trusted vendors. To-
day’s bill will help us do just that. 
The USA Telecommunications Act 
will promote and accelerate the de-
ployment and use of open radio access 
technology by infusing the market-
place with a $750 million grant pro-
gram. This hefty infusion should help

create a marketplace filled with a di-
verse array of vendors, large and small, 
who are aggressively researching and 
innovating. 
Competition among open network so-
lutions will reduce costs for network 
providers by creating a diverse market-
place of trusted suppliers and ensure 
that the same suppliers can withstand 
pressure from those who do not have 
our best interests in mind. 
So this strong endorsement of open, 
interoperable, 
and 
standards-based 
equipment 
would 
help 
ensure 
the 
United States maintains its place as a 
global leader in wireless communica-
tions for 5G as well as future network 
generations. 
I am very pleased to support this leg-
islation which will help ensure the su-
periority of our wireless networks for 
generations to come. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE), one of the principal authors 
of this legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to voice my support for H.R. 
6624, 
the 
USA 
Telecommunications 
Act. 
It is clear that China poses a signifi-
cant threat to the security of the 
United States. Technology produced by 
Chinese companies threatens our sup-
ply chains and our telecommunications 
networks and those of our allies. 
In March, President Trump signed 
into law legislation that was reported 
out of this committee to protect our 
communications 
networks 
against 
threats from foreign companies like 
Huawei and ZTE. 
It is clear that America must have a 
competitive 5G marketplace. The solu-
tion isn’t using government control 
like China, but using markets to our 
advantage so domestic and trusted for-
eign competitors to Huawei can thrive. 
The USA Telecommunications Act 
would authorize up to $750 million for a 
grant program administered by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, in con-
sultation with the FCC and other Fed-
eral agencies, to promote and accel-
erate the deployment and use of open- 
interfaced, standards-based, and inter-
operable 5G networks throughout the 
United States. 
Furthermore, 5G is going to be key 
to unlocking new opportunities for all 
Americans. With more people working 
and studying from home than ever be-
fore, promoting equipment and tech-
nology development like Open RAN 
technology can help to diversify our 
supply chains and keep our networks 
secure, especially as we expand 5G. 
I was proud to introduce this piece of 
legislation with Chairman PALLONE, 
Ranking Member WALDEN, and Con-
gresswoman DORIS MATSUI, and I thank 
them for working with me to help pro-
tect our networks. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers on this legisla-
tion, so I urge its passage, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I also urge 
passage of the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 6624, the USA Telecommuni-
cations Act. 
It has been a decade since I first raised how 
the vulnerabilities in our telecommunications 
infrastructure directly impact our national secu-
rity. I first wrote to the FCC on November 2, 
2010, expressing very grave concerns about 
Huawei and ZTE, companies that have 
opaque entanglements with the Chinese gov-
ernment. In the intervening decade, Huawei 
and ZTE equipment has proliferated across 
our country because it’s cheap, due to the 
Chinese government subsidizing them. 
As we build out 5G networks, we must pro-
tect our national security, especially from enti-
ties like Huawei and ZTE, and it’s why I’m 
proud to cosponsor H.R. 6624, bipartisan and 
bicameral legislation that invests $750 million 
in Open Radio Access Networks, or Open 
RAN, and promotes the deployment of open 
network 5G equipment. 
We hear a great deal and talk about 5G, but 
I don’t think most people can tell you what 5G 
actually is. It’s a set of protocols and stand-
ards agreed to in various multistakeholder fo-
rums. Unlike previous generations of wireless 
standards, 5G is primarily based on software 
independent of the physical telecommuni-
cations equipment which increases security. 
Open RAN is a movement to create secure 
and open software standards for 5G that en-
sures that our communications are secure, no 
matter whose equipment the communications 
travel through. This is critical because even 
after we remove Huawei and ZTE-made cell 
sites from our country, we may still have their 
parts in our telecom ecosystem because they 
make parts used by most providers. We can 
never be 100 percent secure if we rely on in-
secure equipment. This is precisely why we 
need the software used by wireless equipment 
to be secure by design, and Open RAN does 
just that. 
For these reasons, I urge colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 6624. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6624. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7310. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7310, the Spectrum IT Mod-
ernization Act. 
This country has an ever-increasing 
need for access to the Nation’s air-
waves, and that is as true for Federal 
agencies as it is for average Americans. 
We use the airwaves for so many crit-
ical things: military radars, air traffic 
control, space communications, our 
cell phones, televisions, WiFi routers, 
Bluetooth speakers, and the list goes 
on. That is why we must do everything 
we can to ensure that we are making 
the best, most efficient use of our Fed-
eral airwaves. 
H.R. 7310, the Spectrum IT Mod-
ernization Act, takes vital steps to-
ward being more efficient with our air-
waves by making sure that the Federal 
Government has the most up-to-date 
systems to manage its frequencies, 
sometimes called spectrum. This bill 
makes sure that those systems are 
compatible and interoperable between 
Federal agencies. 
The Spectrum IT Modernization Act 
will also help to promote more effi-
cient use of our Nation’s airwaves by 
encouraging spectrum sharing and by 
updating our Federal spectrum man-
agement systems. 
This bipartisan legislation was intro-
duced by Communications and Tech-
nology Subcommittee Chairman MIKE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5827 
November 17, 2020 
DOYLE
and 
Ranking 
Member 
BOB 
LATTA, 
as 
well 
as 
Representative 
WALBERG and Representative LARSEN 
from Washington. 
More specifically, this bipartisan bill 
would 
require 
the 
National 
Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration, or NTIA, in consultation 
with the Policy and Plans Steering 
Group, to identify a process to mod-
ernize our Federal spectrum manage-
ment infrastructure. It would require 
the NTIA to examine ways to improve 
coordination between Federal agencies 
and improve the ability of those agen-
cies to meet their mission require-
ments in congested spectrum environ-
ments—in other words, share spectrum. 
It would require the NTIA to report 
back to us in less than a year’s time to 
tell us what the plan is for updating 
and improving our Federal spectrum 
management, because this is some-
thing that needs to be done sooner 
rather than later. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation would 
also require the Comptroller General of 
the United States to conduct oversight 
of the implementation of the mod-
ernization plan submitted by the NTIA 
and report to Congress annually on 
that process. 
By managing our Federal spectrum 
infrastructure and making it interoper-
able, Federal entities and the NTIA 
will be able to increase the efficiency 
of Federal spectrum use. This is a good 
thing for our country, and it is cer-
tainly important that we do it now. 
So I hope that my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will join me in voting 
to pass this important bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PALLONE: I write con-
cerning H.R. 7310, the Spectrum IT Mod-
ernization Act of 2020. As a result of your 
having consulted with us on provisions with-
in H.R. 7310 that fall within the Rule X juris-
diction of the Committee on Armed Services, 
I forego any further consideration of this bill 
so that it may proceed expeditiously to the 
House floor for consideration. 
The Committee on Armed Services takes 
this action with our mutual understanding 
that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 7310 
at this time, we do not waive any jurisdic-
tion over subject matter contained in this or 
similar legislation and that our committee 
will be appropriately consulted and involved 
as this bill or similar legislation moves for-
ward so that we may address any remaining 
issues in our jurisdiction. 
Finally, I ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
bill report filed by the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, as well as in the Congres-
sional Record during floor consideration, to 
memorialize our understanding. Thank you 
for the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our respective committees. 
Sincerely, 
ADAM SMITH, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2020. 
Hon. ADAM SMITH, 
Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SMITH: Thank you for con-
sulting with the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 7310, the 
Spectrum IT Modernization Act of 2020, so 
that the bill may proceed expeditiously to 
the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 7310 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 7310, 
the Spectrum IT Modernization Act. 
I would like to thank Chairman 
DOYLE and his team for working with 
us, along with our colleagues in the 
Senate who introduced this bill, Sen-
ators WICKER, CANTWELL, INHOFE, and 
REED. 
Today’s bipartisan legislation will 
help improve NTIA’s ability to fulfill 
its mandate of managing spectrum 
among Federal agencies. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has long conducted oversight of 
our Nation’s spectrum resources, and 
we work to balance the critical agency 
mission needs and the demand to make 
spectrum 
available 
for 
commercial 
users. 
Through NTIA and the Federal Com-
munications Commission, we have suc-
cessfully made Federal spectrum avail-
able for commercial use, which is why 
the United States has led the world in 
deploying advanced networks such as 
3G and 4G, and we are continuing these 
efforts to maintain U.S. leadership in 
5G. 
Working across all of the Federal 
agencies has resulted in unprecedented 
commercial access to our airwave re-
sources—like the recently announced 
100 megahertz of spectrum identified 
for commercial use that the FCC will 
auction next year—and has garnered 
billions of dollars in private invest-
ment by the private sector. 
In order to leverage the efficiencies 
and innovation from our free market 
system, NTIA must have visibility 
across Federal agencies as to how agen-
cies are using or not using these crit-
ical resources consistent with their 
statutory mission. 
As our world continues to demand in-
creased connectivity, it is essential 
that we harness technological innova-
tions and empower the NTIA to effi-
ciently track Federal spectrum use to 
identify new opportunities to improve 
efficiency. Done correctly, this results 
in benefits for American consumers, 
taxpayers, and, frankly, the Federal 
agencies as well. 
H.R. 7310 would require NTIA to es-
tablish a process to upgrade their spec-
trum management infrastructure for 
the 21st century. The bill would direct 
the policy coordination arm of NTIA to 
submit a plan to Congress as to how 
they will standardize the data collec-
tion across agencies and then directs 
agencies with Federal spectrum assign-
ments from NTIA to issue an imple-
mentation plan to interoperate with 
NTIA’s plan. 
This is a good-government bill—it 
really is—and with continued support 
and oversight from Congress, we can 
continue the United States’ leadership 
in making Federal spectrum available 
for flexible use by the private sector. 
So I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I urge passage of the legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, so I urge sup-
port of the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HIMES). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 7310. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

FRAUD AND SCAM REDUCTION 
ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2610) to establish a Senior Scams 
Prevention Advisory Council to collect 
and disseminate model educational ma-
terials useful in identifying and pre-
venting scams that affect seniors, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

TITLE VI—DETERMINATION OF 
BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
SEC. 601. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2610. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 2610, the Fraud and Scam 
Reduction Act. This bipartisan bill was 
introduced by Representatives BLUNT 
ROCHESTER and WALBERG and advanced 
out of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee by a voice vote. 
Reducing scams and fraud is an issue 
of utmost importance in every commu-
nity, and especially so during these un-
certain and unprecedented times. Right 
now, we are, fortunately, seeing the 
best of humanity, but unscrupulous 
scammers and fraudsters still abound 
seeking to capitalize on confusion and 
fear. 
Seniors, Mr. Speaker, are especially 
vulnerable. According to the most re-
cent report from the Federal Trade 
Commission, 
older 
adults 
reported 
nearly $400 million in losses from fraud 
in 2018. It is rare to recover these 
losses. We all need to work together to 
protect senior citizens from scams be-
fore they fall victim and suffer these 
monetary losses. 
This bill, originally titled the Stop 
Senior Scams Act, establishes a new 
Senior 
Scams 
Prevention 
Advisory 
Council composed of relevant govern-
ment agencies and industry representa-
tives to collect and implement best 
practices to stop scammers before they 
can cause harm. It establishes a new 
program to prevent fraud that targets 
seniors. The bill will also improve edu-
cational materials on senior scams and 
make sure they are publicly available. 
I want to thank Representatives 
DEUTCH and BUCHANAN for introducing 
the Seniors Fraud Prevention Act 
which was incorporated in H.R. 2610 
during the full committee’s consider-
ation of the bill. That legislation es-
tablishes an office at the FTC dedi-
cated to preventing fraud targeting 
seniors and monitoring the market for 
such fraud. 
This bill also includes the Protecting 
Seniors from Emergency Scams Act 
which was introduced by Representa-
tives KELLY and MARSHALL. This bill 
streamlines efforts to protect seniors 
from falling prey to scams during na-
tional 
emergencies, 
such 
as 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, by establishing a 
searchable database of scams targeting 
seniors. 
One often overlooked area in Federal 
fraud prevention efforts are scams tar-
geting Indian Tribes and Tribal mem-
bers. The scope and scale of scams af-
fecting Indian Tribes has not been well- 
documented, hindering efforts to pre-
vent them. So I also want to thank 
Representative LUJA´ N—soon Governor 
LUJA´ N—and 
also 
Representative 
GIANFORTE for their work on this issue 
and for introducing the Protecting In-
dian Tribes from Scams Act, which was 
also incorporated in this bill, H.R. 2610. 
The legislation that they sponsored re-
quires the FTC to issue a report on 
scams targeting Indian Tribes or Tribal 
members and update its website to in-
clude information on these scams. 
In addition, our State attorneys gen-
eral play a critical role in enforcing 
and complementing Federal consumer

protection laws. The FTC Collabora-
tion Act, introduced by Representa-
tives O’HALLERAN and HUDSON and in-
corporated also into this bill, will help 
the FTC optimize its collaboration 
with 
States 
attorneys 
general 
by 
studying the matter and issuing a re-
port on how to further promote col-
laboration. 
So I want to commend Representa-
tives BLUNT ROCHESTER and WALBERG 
for introducing this bipartisan legisla-
tion, as well as all of the other lead 
sponsors of the bills that were folded 
into this larger legislative package. I 
also want to thank Ranking Member 
WALDEN
and subcommittee Ranking 
Member RODGERS for working with us 
to move this bill through the Energy 
and Commerce Committee on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
As you can see, Mr. Speaker, this bill 
incorporates a number of important 
pieces of legislation. For all those rea-
sons, I ask my colleagues to support 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 2610, the Stop Seniors 
Scam Act. 
I too want to thank the main spon-
sors, Representatives WALBERG
and 
BLUNT ROCHESTER. I know we are all 
keeping Representative WALBERG
in 
our thoughts and prayers as he copes 
with COVID right now, or he would be 
here on the floor. 
I also want to acknowledge Rep-
resentatives 
HUDSON, 
LUJA´ N, 
O’HALLERAN, KELLY, and GIANFORTE. I 
guess to follow up on our chairman’s 
comment, this was the bill to cospon-
sor if you want to move into higher of-
fice apparently. Both a future Gov-
ernor and Senator are cosponsors here, 
and who knows where the rest of the 
gang goes. 
The Stop Senior Scams Act would es-
tablish a Senior Scams Prevention Ad-
visory Council which would create 
model educational materials to edu-
cate employees of retail companies, fi-
nancial institutions, and wire transfer 
companies on how to identify and pre-
vent scams. Importantly, this effort 
prioritizes scams targeting our senior 
citizens and Native nations, popu-
lations that have unfortunately and 
tragically been targeted at a much 
higher rate during the COVID–19 pan-
demic by scammers offering false medi-
cations—— 
Can you imagine that, Mr. Speaker? 
Or faster ways to claim stimulus 
checks or Social Security checks. All 
of them are fraud. 
The bill would also help enhance col-
laborative efforts between the Federal 
Trade Commission and State attorneys 
general to prevent, publicize, and pe-
nalize frauds and scams targeting U.S. 
citizens. 
It is critical for Congress to do our 
duty to help end these scams. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
number of speakers from our com-
mittee on the various bills incor-
porated in this, and I will start with 
the sponsor for the main bill, H.R. 2610. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Delaware 
(Ms. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER). 
Ms. 
BLUNT 
ROCHESTER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 
2610, the Fraud and Scam Reduction 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, we have all received 
those calls and those emails—folks pre-
tending to be from a Federal agency or 
law enforcement telling you that they 
need your personal information or 
money. And while many of us may ig-
nore those calls or send the emails to 
spam, the reality is that these fraud 
schemes are real, they are dangerous, 
and they are often targeted at seniors. 
Bad actors preying on older Ameri-
cans is, unfortunately, nothing new. 
But in the midst of a global pandemic 
impacting Americans’ lives and liveli-
hoods, cracking down on these scams 
must be a priority. That is why earlier 
this Congress I was proud to introduce 
the Stop Senior Scams Act along with 
my Republican colleague, Representa-
tive TIM WALBERG, who worked very 
hard on this. We send our thoughts and 
prayers to him. 
This bill, as its name suggests, was 
aimed at cracking down on these scams 
by creating a Federal Trade Commis-
sion advisory group and was supported 
by the AARP. The FTC group that 
would be created would be made up of 
government agencies, consumer advo-
cates, and industry representatives to 
help identify potential sources of fraud. 
It would create educational materials 
for our Nation’s seniors to protect 
them from these dangerous schemes 
and ensure that they are not taken ad-
vantage of. 
Under the leadership of Chairman 
PALLONE
and 
Chairwoman 
SCHA-
KOWSKY, and thanks to Ranking Mem-
ber WALDEN, who is leaving us—and we 
are also sorry to see him leave—and 
Mrs. RODGERS, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee has been focused on 
cracking down on fraud. It was in that 
spirit that our committee combined 
the Stop Senior Scams Act with other 
antifraud provisions, creating a strong-
er and more comprehensive bill. I am 
also proud to say that protecting our 
constituents is not a partisan issue and 
that all five measures under H.R. 2610 
are bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the most funda-
mental obligations of government is to 
protect its citizens. Now more than 
ever, the least we can do is protect al-
ready vulnerable seniors from being 
taken advantage of by bad actors. 
The Fraud and Scam Reduction Act 
would give our seniors the information 
they need and empower them to avoid 
these dangerous and malicious scams. 
This bill is about protecting our grand-
parents, our parents, our sisters, our 
brothers, our neighbors, and our aunts 
and uncles. This is about protecting 
Americans, especially during a pan-
demic. 
I am proud to have worked with the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. I 
thank all of the other cosponsors and 
my colleagues, Democrat and Repub-
lican, for the work that they did to 
strengthen this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support its passage. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Delaware, my friend, for her work 
on this and so many other pieces of leg-
islation and our work together. We 
have had a good run. There is still 
more work to be done in the next 40- 
some days, but I thank her for her kind 
comments and her good work. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who is the 
chair of our Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce. The 
gentlewoman has done such a wonder-
ful job in trying to protect us from 
these frauds and scams, particularly 
during the coronavirus. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. I am 
very proud that the next three bills are 
bills that have come out of the sub-
committee that I chair on Consumer 
Protection and Commerce. I absolutely 
want to thank all of the authors of the 
legislation, 
Representatives 
BLUNT 
ROCHESTER and WALBERG; and the au-
thors of the legislation that was incor-
porated into this bill, Representatives 
DEUTCH and LUJA´ N, for their work on 
the Seniors Fraud Prevention Act; 
Representatives KELLY and MARSHALL 
for the Protecting Seniors from Emer-
gency Scams Act; and Representatives 
LUJA´ N
and GIANFORTE
for the Pro-
tecting Indian Tribes from Scams Act; 
and Representatives O’HALLERAN and 
HUDSON for the FTC Collaboration Act. 
Some of our most vulnerable fellow 
Americans have been the targets and 
the victims of fraud and scams during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Scammers es-
pecially target seniors. They exploit 
fear or confusion during crises and 
emergencies and prey on seniors’ trust 
and assumption that they will be too 
embarrassed to finally report scams to 
the relevant authorities. In 2018 alone, 
seniors lost almost $400 million to 
fraud. 
Another often overlooked target of 
fraud and scams are the Indian Tribes 
and Tribal members. We urgently need 
a better understanding of fraud tar-
geting these communities. 
This legislation tackles these prob-
lems. It establishes a new office that 
focuses on the prevention of fraud that 
targets seniors, including fraudulent 
marketing materials, and it does ad-
dress the problem of the Tribes and 
Tribal members that need to be pro-
tected also from the scams. 
So I am very proud of this legislation 
and grateful to the many sponsors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5831 
November 17, 2020 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I have said before and I will say it 
again: I don’t think there is a more 
fierce advocate for consumers than the 
gentlewoman 
who 
chairs 
the 
sub-
committee. 
She 
has, 
once 
again, 
brought solid legislation to the floor. 
We appreciate her and her team work-
ing with us to make this bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Mexico (Mr. LUJA´ N). Again, I thank 
him for all that he has done as our As-
sistant Speaker and all that he has 
done for our Indian Tribes. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to support the Fraud and Scam Reduc-
tion Act, which includes my bipartisan 
Protecting Indian Tribes from Scams 
Act that I introduced alongside Rep-
resentative GIANFORTE, to address the 
rise of scams during this deadly pan-
demic. 
As our Nation grieves the loss of 
more than 247,000 Americans to COVID– 
19, and millions of families experience 
financial hardship, it is nothing short 
of reprehensible that scammers are 
preying 
on 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
amongst us. 
Fraud reports to the Federal Trade 
Commission, which had been steady at 
770,000 per quarter over the past 4 
years, jumped to 1.1 million this sum-
mer, including an increase of 144 per-
cent coinciding with the pandemic. 
That demonstrates why we must come 
together to protect Americans against 
fraud and theft. 
Nationwide, predatory schemes have 
already cost Americans over $1.5 bil-
lion in stolen assets so far in 2020. 
Scammers have targeted the $1,200 eco-
nomic impact payments, peddled false 
treatments 
for 
COVID–19, 
and 
at-
tempted to sell defective personal pro-
tective equipment at a time when the 
fears and confusion over COVID–19 re-
main high. 
These scams have put elders’, mili-
tary servicemembers’, and families’ 
health and finances at risk, and it is 
time for Congress to put an end to the 
despicable practice. This bipartisan ef-
fort will help Congress take additional 
measures to tackle this threat and bet-
ter understand the scale of this crisis. 
As COVID–19 cases and hospitaliza-
tions rise in New Mexico and across the 
Nation, I will continue working, on a 
bipartisan basis, to provide additional 
relief and alleviate the financial pres-
sures that all New Mexicans are facing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation to protect our 
communities against scams and fraud. 
I thank the chairman for his work. I 
thank Chairwoman SCHAKOWSKY
for 
her work. And I thank Chairman and 
current Ranking Member GREG WAL-
DEN for his work, his commitment to 
his constituents, his service to the peo-
ple of America. 
Mr. Speaker, GREG is a good friend. It 
has been fun to spar with him. It has 
been fun to work with him. I look for-
ward to his public service after he re-
tires from the U.S. House of Represent-
atives. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend 
from New Mexico. I think it is worth 
pointing out that this probably won’t 
make a lot of coverage in national 
media, but he chaired the Democratic 
Congressional 
Campaign 
Committee 
when I chaired the National Repub-
lican Congressional Committee. We are 
of different parties and sort of different 
regions, in a way; we are both west-
erners. But once again, we are working 
together for the American people, and 
we do a lot of that around here. Espe-
cially on the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, we have a fine record of 
working things out. We have 16 of these 
bipartisan things on the floor today, 
and I just wish our constituents saw 
more of this. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish the gentleman 
from New Mexico well in his endeavors 
across the Capitol. He will bring a 
breath of fresh air over there, and I 
know his commitment to his State and 
all who reside in it. 
I hope our paths do continue to cross 
in some manner. I have enjoyed serving 
with the gentleman from New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 8 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. KELLY), who is a member of 
our committee. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we have seen an increase in 
scams 
targeting 
older 
Americans. 
These scammers promise everything 
from COVID cures and take-home test-
ing kits to insurance and stimulus 
funds. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 2610, the Fraud and Scam 
Reduction Act. This bill, championed 
by my friend, Representative LISA 
BLUNT ROCHESTER, includes my bill and 
Representative MARSHALL’s bill, the 
Protecting Seniors from Emergency 
Scams Act. This bipartisan legislation 
ensures that the FTC makes available 
resources for older Americans about 
the type and number of scams tar-
geting their region. It also requires an 
FTC report to Congress on that infor-
mation so we can prevent seniors from 
falling victim to scams during future 
pandemics. 
While we may be closer to a vaccine, 
this will likely only increase the num-
ber of these diabolical scams. Let’s arm 
older Americans with the right infor-
mation to prevent themselves from 
falling victim. Let’s make locally spe-
cific resources available to caregivers 
already working around the clock. 
Let’s help the FTC win this fight 
against scammers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of 
H.R. 2610. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague from Illinois 
for her support of this legislation and 
her work on it. 
Once again, I urge passage of the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
also urge passage of this bill, which, as 
we mentioned, includes a lot of other 
bills as well and makes up an impor-
tant package dealing with fraud and 
scams. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2610, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to establish an office 
within the Federal Trade Commission 
and an outside advisory group to pre-
vent fraud targeting seniors and to di-
rect the Commission to study and sub-
mit a report to Congress on scams tar-
geting seniors and Indian tribes, and 
for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
COMBATING PANDEMIC SCAMS 
ACT OF 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6435) to direct the Federal Trade 
Commission to develop and dissemi-
nate information to the public about 
scams related to COVID–19, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6435 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6435. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 6435, the Combating Pan-
demic Scams Act. This bipartisan bill 
was 
introduced 
by 
Representatives 
CARTER, KUSTER, HUDSON, and BLUNT 
ROCHESTER. I thank them for intro-
ducing this measure to help stem the 
tide of scams and fraud during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
In July, the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce held a 
hearing on increased risks during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. During that hear-
ing, we heard about all the ways 
scammers are taking advantage of the 
ongoing national emergency for per-
sonal gain. Whether phishing for stim-
ulus checks or fundraising for fake 
charities, 
scammers 
are 
exploiting 
Americans already struggling finan-
cially and diverting resources away 
from where they could provide des-
perately needed help. 
One new scam that has emerged dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic is the con-
tact tracing scam. This scam, which in-
volves fraudsters posing as contact 
tracers from public health depart-
ments, 
is 
exacerbating 
the 
public 
health crisis by undermining one of the 
most effective tools we have to keep 
communities safe. 
Instead of documenting the spread of 
the virus or alerting those who might 
have been exposed, these scammers are 
only interested in duping Americans 
into turning over sensitive personal in-
formation or downloading malicious 
software on their device. 
H.R. 6435 will establish a comprehen-
sive national database of scams related 
to COVID–19 so that the public can dif-
ferentiate the real contact tracers from 
the imposters and learn how to identify 
other scams on their own. It will also 
require the Federal Trade Commission 
to inform the public about mail, tele-
marketing, and internet scams related 
to COVID–19, including how to report 
such scams to the appropriate agency. 
Mr. Speaker, as the pandemic con-
tinues, we will continue to see more 
scams unfold, unfortunately. But this 
bill will make sure that the American 
public 
is 
regularly 
updated 
about 
scams so they can protect themselves 
and their loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
bill. It is going to protect consumers 
during this pandemic, and I call on all 
of my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6435, the Combating Pandemic Scams 
Act of 2020. I thank Representative 
BUDDY
CARTER
from Georgia, along 
with Representatives KUSTER, BLUNT 
ROCHESTER, and HUDSON, for their work 
and their leadership on, again, another 
bipartisan piece of legislation. 
As we all know, we are in the midst 
of this horrible pandemic. COVID–19 
has forced millions of Americans to 
isolate and rely on the internet to 
work, learn, receive healthcare, stay 
connected to loved ones, and so much 
more. Unfortunately, bad actors come 
out of the gutters wherever they live to 
seek to exploit times of crisis and tar-
get our most vulnerable. 
During this pandemic, we have seen 
scammers attempt to exploit consumer 
fear and confusion by falsely promising 
additional stimulus checks, illegit-
imate lifesaving medications, and fake 
avenues to save businesses or pay em-
ployees—all scams. 
H.R. 6435 aims to protect Americans, 
especially senior citizens and people 
with disabilities, from malicious and 
deceptive scams. The bill directs the 
Federal Trade Commission to prioritize 
informing the most vulnerable among 
us about mail, telemarketing, and 
internet scams, all related to COVID– 
19. 
Importantly, the bill would provide 
Americans with the tools they need to 
educate and protect themselves against 
these very scams. This legislation will 
be even more important as we work to-
gether to ensure that the COVID vac-
cine is delivered in a safe and timely 
fashion. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see H.R. 
6435 under consideration today. I urge 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), the sponsor 
of the bill. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6435, 
the Combating Pandemic Scams Act of 
2020. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to help in-
troduce this bipartisan bill with my 
colleague BUDDY CARTER in April, and I 
appreciate the support of our col-
leagues on the Republican side of the 
aisle. I would like to take a moment to 
commend BUDDY for his leadership on 
this important topic. 
During these challenging times for 
our country, I have constantly been 
impressed by Americans’ commitment 
to helping their neighbors pull through 
this crisis. Sadly, where many see an 
opportunity to lend a helping hand, 
others see a chance to make a quick 
buck. 
Scammers have posed as medical re-
searchers, offering opportunities to 
participate in clinical trials. They have 
attempted to sell nonexistent PPE. 
They have even tried to trick seniors 
into buying fake COVID–19 test kits. 
These shameful acts must not only be 
condemned, but Congress must take ac-
tion to crack down on these scams and 
inform the American people of these 
devious efforts. 
Our bipartisan legislation will help 
stop COVID scams by directing Federal 
agencies and departments to inform 
Americans 
about 
these 
criminal 
schemes so they can stay alert and 
keep themselves safe. By aggregating 
data and providing the public with in-
formation on mail, telemarketing, and 
robocall fraud schemes, Americans can 
defend themselves and their families. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important 
step forward, and I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER), the coauthor of the 
bill who has been very active on many 
of these pieces of legislation. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
legislation, H.R. 6435, because of the 
positive impact it will have on the 
American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5833 
November 17, 2020 
It has been no surprise that we have 
seen a rise in fraud and criminal activ-
ity as the Nation grapples with the 
pandemic response. In these difficult 
times, scammers have sought to take 
advantage of our fellow Americans. 
Whether it is elderly individuals being 
preyed upon by financial scammers or 
people ordering fake health products, 
there has been a number of scams fac-
ing our constituents. 
That is why I introduced the Com-
bating Pandemic Scams Act with my 
good friend, Congresswoman KUSTER, 
to address this issue. 
This bill would direct the FTC, along 
with other Federal partners, to dis-
seminate 
information 
about 
these 
scams to the public to better protect 
themselves. That information would be 
user-friendly, ensuring vulnerable pop-
ulations, such as senior citizens and 
those with disabilities, would have the 
same amount of access. Ensuring peo-
ple have the most up-to-date informa-
tion on how to protect themselves is 
critical to getting through these trying 
times. 
Federal agencies, such as the FTC, 
have been very active in going after 
these offenders who have targeted 
Americans during this pandemic. This 
bill will support those Federal efforts 
and help prepare Americans to help 
protect themselves from these scams. 
The bottom line is, this is common-
sense legislation to go after the people 
preying on our neighbors and commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their bipartisan support of this leg-
islation and the committee staff for 
their work on getting this across the 
finish line. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass this legislation. 
b 1445 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the chair of the 
subcommittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
here we have another great bipartisan 
bill that has come out of the com-
mittee I am so proud to chair, the Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce Sub-
committee of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. I thank the authors 
of the legislation: Representatives CAR-
TER, HUDSON, KUSTER, and BLUNT ROCH-
ESTER. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has been a 
time of confusion and fear for many 
Americans, and scammers have no-
ticed. Fraudsters have tried to steal 
stimulus checks and trick consumers 
with fake medical treatments and even 
vaccines. Seniors and those with dis-
abilities are especially vulnerable. 
This legislation will protect Amer-
ican consumers, especially our most 
vulnerable, by increasing public aware-
ness of COVID–19 scams. It directs the 
Federal Trade Commission to develop 
and disseminate information to the 
public about scams related to COVID– 
19. 
The FTC will also create a com-
prehensive 
national 
database 
that 
tracks the COVID–19 scams in con-
sultation with the Attorney General 
and the HHS Secretary. This database 
will protect American consumers from 
malicious scams. Consumers will be 
armed with information about the pan-
demic scams and how to avoid those 
scams. So we must act now to prevent 
further harm to American consumers. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle for their work on this legislation. 
I urge its passage, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6435, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PANDEMIC EFFECTS ON HOME 
SAFETY AND TOURISM ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8121) to require the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to study

injuries and deaths associated with 
consumer products, and for other pur-
poses, as amended.

from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8121. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 8121. I want to begin by 
thanking 
Representatives 
CA´ RDENAS 
and DAVIS for their leadership on the 
bill, the Pandemic Effects on Home 
Safety and Tourism Act. This bill ad-
vanced out of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee by a voice vote. 
With the COVID–19 pandemic forcing 
us to spend more time at home and 
finding new indoor and outdoor activi-
ties suitable for social distancing, it is 
critically important that we keep 
track of any new trends in injuries and 
deaths that might be occurring. 
This bill will require the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to provide 
quarterly updates to the American 
public regarding the effects of COVID– 
19 on home safety, including any 
emerging threats from either new prod-
ucts or new habits from working and 
playing at home. This report will as-
semble data from a variety of sources, 
including media reports and poison 
control centers, in addition to the 
CPSC’s traditional data sources. 
The bill will also identify commu-
nities or groups that may be dispropor-
tionately affected so that we can better 
target efforts to protect those commu-
nities. We already know children are 
particularly vulnerable during these 
times as parents struggle to work re-
motely and supervise children at the 
same time. For example, there have 
been increased reports of accidental 
poisonings and fractures related to bi-
cycle and trampoline usage. It is im-
portant to identify other groups that 
may also be vulnerable. 
I want to thank Representatives CAS-
TOR and UPTON for introducing another 
bill, the Protecting Tourism in the 
United States Act, which was incor-
porated in H.R. 8121 during the com-
mittee’s consideration of the bill. 
Their legislation will rebuild the 
tourism and travel industry, which has 
struggled under the strain of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. All sectors of the 
travel industry have been particularly 
hard hit, including hotels, restaurants, 
attractions, and passenger air, rail, and 
rental car sectors. 
This bill requires the Department of 
Commerce to conduct a detailed study 
and report to Congress on the effects of 
the pandemic on the tourism industry, 
including on jobs and revenue, so that 
we will know how to best direct assist-
ance to the 16 million American work-
ers and families who rely on the jobs 
that the travel industry supports. 
Again, I thank Ranking Member 
WALDEN
and Subcommittee Ranking 
Member RODGERS for working with us 
to move this bill through the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. I also com-
mend our Subcommittee Chair SCHA-
KOWSKY for her relentless commitment 
to fighting for consumers, and particu-
larly for seniors, I want to say. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8121, the Pandemic Effects on Home 
Safety and Tourism Act. 
I thank Representatives CA´ RDENAS 
and DAVIS for their leadership and ef-
fort on this bill to protect consumers. 
I also thank Ranking Member UPTON 
and Chairman CASTOR, as their legisla-
tion to promote and assist the recovery 
of our tourism industry was adopted as 
part of this bill; as well as Ranking 
Member MCMORRIS RODGERS and Chair 
SCHAKOWSKY
along with, obviously, 
Chairman PALLONE. 
The Pandemic Effects on Home Safe-
ty and Tourism Act would direct the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
to report and make available to the 
public information about injuries and 
deaths from consumer products during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. This would 
provide Americans with updates on 
trends of potentially hazardous prod-
ucts that have entered the marketplace 
during this critical time. 
In addition to studying the trends of 
injuries, the bill would support further 
research on how the COVID–19 pan-
demic has impacted the U.S. travel and 
tourism industries. Many communities, 
particularly rural communities like 
those in my district, rely on tourism. 
We must have the information nec-
essary to promote and assist the travel 
and tourism industry as we emerge 
from this devastating pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the authors of this legislation, 
Representatives CA´ RDENAS and DAVIS. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic worsens 
this winter, we must protect Ameri-
cans who are spending more time in 
their homes. The pandemic has mag-
nified risks associated with household 
consumer products. Children are par-
ticularly vulnerable, especially as par-
ents are juggling their children while 
working from home. 
Unsupervised children face greater 
risks from bikes, scooters, trampolines, 
and pools. Calls to the poison control 
centers for children ingesting hand 
sanitizer have increased this year as 
well. 
This legislation will direct the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission to 
study and report on injuries and deaths 
that are associated with consumer 
products during the pandemic. It will 
ensure Americans have up-to-date in-
formation about risks to safety as the 
pandemic continues. We will learn

about emergency safety threats more 
quickly so that action can actually be 
taken to protect consumers. 
This legislation also deals with the 
issues that are being faced right now 
by the travel industry. This legislation 
directs the Department of Commerce 
to study and report to Congress on the 
impact of the pandemic on travel and 
tourism. 
As Americans stay in their homes to 
protect themselves, travel and tourism 
have plummeted. The industry is an 
important part of our national econ-
omy, and over 15.7 million Americans 
work in the travel and tourism indus-
tries. These jobs are vital to many 
local communities. 
The decline of travel and tourism has 
devastated many other parts of the 
economy. Live events, the arts, hotels, 
and restaurants have all felt the effect. 
We must understand the full impact of 
the pandemic on the travel and tour-
ism industry so that we can help the 
industry recover and come back strong. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), who has put so 
much work into this piece of legisla-
tion and so many others. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairman PALLONE 
and Ranking Member WALDEN for their 
leadership on this very important piece 
of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and 
Commerce Committee staff for work-
ing with us in a very bipartisan way to 
make sure that this bill came to the 
floor today with such bipartisan con-
sensus. 
I also thank my colleague and my 
fellow original cosponsor of this bill, 
Congressman 
CA´ RDENAS
from 
Cali-
fornia, the vice chair of the House En-
ergy and Commerce Subcommittee on 
Consumer Protection and Commerce. 
His leadership in introducing this bill 
was crucial, and I really appreciate 
him allowing me to be the bipartisan 
lead cosponsor. 
As my colleagues before me have 
stated so eloquently, the COVID–19 
pandemic has truly changed the world 
as we know it, and that includes many 
of our daily routines. We don’t have to 
look much farther than the House floor 
to see that that has happened. 
Stay-at-home orders and COVID–19 
mitigation efforts mean families and 
individuals 
are 
obviously 
spending 
more time at home. And when not— 
like us—on Zoom calls, we need to be 
sure that, for the products that are in 
our homes, we understand the dangers 
that may exist for young children run-
ning around while parents are working 
to ensure that their jobs continue. 
This is a commonsense, bipartisan 
piece of legislation. As was said, it is 
going to require the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission to study the effects 
of COVID–19 on families and the safety 
of our families and children. 
I ask that my colleagues remind 
themselves that this is another in-
stance of true bipartisanship in a very 
polarized world that we all live in and 
to support this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friends on both sides of the aisle 
and our terrific staffs for their great 
work on these 16 pieces of legislation 
that we brought forward to the House 
floor from the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
I urge passage of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8121, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to require the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission to 
study the effect of the COVID–19 pan-
demic on injuries and deaths associated 
with consumer products and to direct 
the Secretary of Commerce to study 
and report on the effects of the COVID– 
19 pandemic on the travel and tourism 
industry in the United States.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

guidance applicable to transport-category 
aircraft defining risk severity; 
‘‘(D) any adverse handling quality that

‘‘(6) NONCONFORMITY WITH APPROVED TYPE 
DESIGN.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
subparagraph (D), a holder of a production 
certificate for an aircraft may not present a 
nonconforming aircraft to the Administrator 
for issuance of an airworthiness certificate. 
‘‘(B) CIVIL PENALTY.—Notwithstanding sec-
tion 46301, a production certificate holder 
who knowingly violates subparagraph (A) 
shall be liable to the Administrator for a 
civil penalty of not more than $1,000,000 for 
each nonconforming aircraft. 
‘‘(C) PENALTY
CONSIDERATIONS.—In deter-
mining the amount of a civil penalty under 
subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall 
consider— 
‘‘(i) the nature, circumstances, extent, and 
gravity of the violation, including the length 
of time the nonconformity was known but 
not disclosed; and 
‘‘(ii) with respect to the violator, the de-
gree of culpability, any history of prior vio-
lations, and the size of the business concern. 
‘‘(D) REMEDIAL ACTION.—The Administrator 
may permit a production certificate holder 
to present a nonconforming aircraft to the 
Administrator for an airworthiness certifi-
cate if— 
‘‘(i) the Administrator determines the non-
conformity, when compared to the configura-
tion approved as part of the type design, does 
not diminish by any degree the aircraft’s 
safe operation without any change in flight 
crew operating procedures; 
‘‘(ii) the Administrator determines the 
nonconformity was not the product of an in-
tentional decision by the production certifi-
cate holder to alter the aircraft’s configura-
tion from the approved type design; 
‘‘(iii) the production certificate holder has 
fully complied with subparagraph (E); 
‘‘(iv) the production certificate holder 
agrees to correct the nonconformity on all 
nonconforming aircraft within a timeframe 
that is— 
‘‘(I) prescribed by the Administrator; and 
‘‘(II) commensurate with the severity of 
the nonconformity;

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8408, as amended.

myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8408, the bipartisan Aircraft Certifi-
cation 
Reform 
Accountability 
Act, 
today because a U.S. commercial air-
plane manufacturer and, candidly, the 
Federal Aviation Administration broke 
the public trust. 346 innocent people 
died on two Boeing 737 MAX airplanes 
in October 2018 and March 2019. 
Despite the crashes, both Boeing and 
the FAA found that the certification of 
the 737 MAX was compliant with FAA 
regulations. It was compliant with reg-
ulations, yet 346 people died. I believe 
that that shows that there are prob-
lems with the regulatory system that 
need to be addressed. 
Ranking Member GRAVES, Aviation 
Subcommittee Chair LARSEN, Aviation 
Subcommittee 
Ranking 
Member 
GRAVES, and I actively worked on this 
bill over a number of months. I think I 
can speak for all of us when I say our 
intent is to ensure a U.S.-manufac-
tured airplane never again crashes due 
to design issues or regulatory failures. 
The 
Boeing 
737 
MAX 
has 
been 
grounded since the second crash, that 
of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on 
March 10, 2019. This has been the long-
est grounding of a transport plane in 
the history of commercial aviation and 
will likely end this week when the FAA 
judges that Boeing’s modifications to 
the deadly system that caused the 
crashes are sufficient. 
The FAA and Boeing have spent the 
last 20 months doing what they should 
have done before the 737 MAX ever en-
tered service, so consideration of this 
bill is timely. 
There is a long litany of negligence, 
recklessness, corporate greed—particu-
larly at the executive level—and errors 
in the design and certification of the 
737 MAX that culminated in the crash-
es of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian 
Airlines flight 302 and, ultimately, this 
legislation. 
I am not going to go over all of the 
stunning acts and omissions within 
Boeing and the regulatory capture that 
prevented the FAA from detecting and 
correcting those acts and omissions be-
cause they have been laid bare in nu-
merous reports since the accidents, in-
cluding those of the Committee on 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure, 
which recently concluded the longest 
and most comprehensive investigation 
in the committee’s history with a near-
ly 250-page report on the technical and 
regulatory failures in this story; the 
Joint Authorities Technical Review, a 
team of U.S. and international safety 
regulators who assessed the design and 
certification of the 737 MAX; the Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board; a 
special committee convened by the De-
partment of Transportation to evalu-
ate the FAA’s certification process 
with respect to the 737 MAX; the Indo-
nesian National Transportation Safety 
Committee, which investigated the 
crash of Lion Air flight 610; and the 
Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority, 
which investigated the crash of Ethio-
pian Airlines flight 302. 
Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian flight 302 
crashed, ultimately, because of a sys-
tem called the Maneuvering Character-
istics Augmentation System, or MCAS, 
which forced the airplane into dives 
with forces so great the pilots were 
physically unable to counteract them. 
Through numerous investigations, we 
know Boeing intentionally concealed 
the existence of MCAS in cases from 
the airlines and pilots, partly to save 
money on pilot training and partly to 
avoid increased regulatory scrutiny by 
the FAA. 
Level B non-simulator pilot training 
was a design objective for the 737 MAX 
from the outset, according to Boeing’s 
former chief project engineer; and as 
early as 2014, 2 years before the FAA 
made a pilot training determination, a 
Boeing press release and marketing 
materials declared this level of train-
ing for prospective 737 MAX customer 
airlines. In one case, they promised to 
pay a penalty of $1 million per plane to 
a purchaser if a higher level of training 
was necessary. 
We also know that Boeing’s safety 
assessment with respect to MCAS was 
horribly incomplete. MCAS activated 
on both flights because of a tiny, frag-
ile vane, called an alpha vane, pro-
truding from the left side of the nose. 
The alpha vane measures the angle of 
attack between the airplane and on-
coming air. 
When it failed, as these tiny, fragile 
vanes are wont to do, it triggered a 
complex computerized response, which 
included a jarring stick shaker, which 
vibrates the column so violently that if 
you are holding onto it, your teeth are 
going to rattle to warn of a stall; unre-
lated other cautions and warnings, and 
this plane has a primitive alert system 
unlike all Boeings made in the last 25 
years, as the dozens of prioritized 
things; and warnings that airspeed, al-
titude is unreliable. 
More importantly, the MCAS system, 
an invisible system, left out of the first 
manual, or deleted from the first 
manuals distributed with the plane, 
forced the nose down repeatedly and in-
exorably toward the Earth. 
Now, Boeing assumed pilots would re-
spond to all that and apply the proper 
corrective procedure within 4 seconds. I 
would challenge most experienced pi-
lots to sort through that blizzard of 
alerts in 4 seconds, not knowing of the 
existence of the system, to determine 
what is going on and apply proper pro-
cedure. 
A Boeing test pilot in a simulator in 
2012 couldn’t do that, as the committee 
staff investigation revealed. It took 
that pilot more than 10 seconds to re-
spond correctly and found the condi-
tion to be ‘‘catastrophic,’’ meaning the 
situation 
would 
have 
been 
unsalvageable. The plane would have 
crashed. The simulator crashed. And it 
did not share that information with 
the FAA or its MAX customers. 
But Boeing and the FAA never as-
sessed the airplane-level effects of an 
alpha vane failure, how it would trig-
ger erroneous MCAS activation, and 
how pilots would respond; not that 
there wasn’t plenty of opportunity 
within Boeing to stop and think about 
MCAS and the hazardous situations it 
would create. 
At one juncture, a Boeing employee 
was authorized by the FAA as part of 
the ODA, Organization Designation Au-
thorization, to determine the plane’s 
compliance with the FAA require-
ments, asked in an email if the air-
plane was vulnerable to a single alpha 
vane failure. The employee was given a 
summary assurance that MCAS was 
not vulnerable, but that assurance was 
incorrect. The eyes and ears of the 
FAA on the ground at Boeing left the 
FAA largely in the dark regarding 
issues that affected the airplane cer-
tification.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5845 
November 17, 2020 
We uncovered numerable instances of 
similar missed opportunities in our in-
vestigation. The culture of profits at 
any cost with the company may well 
have been a factor in the failure to root 
out safety problems. 
According to a 2016 internal survey of 
similar Boeing employees, who, at the 
time, were called authorized represent-
atives of the FAA, 39 percent said they 
felt undue pressure from Boeing man-
agement to make decisions in the com-
pany’s interest. 
And then there was the FAA, whose 
complacency rendered the agency vir-
tually a nonpresence in this story until 
then-Acting 
Administrator 
Elwell 
grounded the airplane after the second 
one crashed and after virtually every 
other agency in the world had ground-
ed these airplanes. 
The FAA was either unable or unwill-
ing to conduct rigorous oversight of 
Boeing during the certification proc-
ess. A Boeing employee wrote an inter-
nal email in 2015 that, during a presen-
tation of the 737 MAX, FAA officials 
were like ‘‘dogs watching TV.’’ And 
they hid the mention of MAX in two 
lines in a very lengthy presentation of 
MCAS. 
Throughout our investigation, we 
learned the FAA and Boeing separately 
performed an analysis after the first 
crash, that of Lion Air, which con-
cluded that, if left uncorrected, the de-
sign flaw in the 737 MAX could result 
in as many as 15 future crashes. And 
despite the calculations and the agen-
cy’s own Transport Airplane Risk As-
sessment Methodology, or TARAM, the 
FAA let it continue to fly. 
In fact, the head of safety for the 
FAA came to my office in February 
after the first crash and said that was 
a one-off, there is no problem with this 
plane. But that report had been pro-
duced before he came to see me. Now, 
when we finally got him to a 7-hour re-
corded testimony, he said he never 
heard of anything that said 15 of the 
planes would crash. 
Well, what does the head of safety do 
at the FAA? Seriously. 
Now, here is the most outrageous in-
dication of a broken safety culture 
within the very agency that is sup-
posed to be the leading champion of 
strong safety cultures. In a recent sur-
vey of FAA aviation safety employees, 
56 percent of those involved in certifi-
cation activities believed there was too 
much external influence on the agency 
and that this influence was affecting 
FAA safety decisions. 
This is 25 years after the horrible 
crash of Value Jet in Florida, when I fi-
nally got the law changed to say that 
the FAA is not to promote and regu-
late in the public interest and safety; it 
is only to regulate in the public inter-
est and safety, not to promote the in-
dustry. 
All of these factors alone, and more, 
all part of a broken system that broke 
the public’s trust culminated in 2018 
and 2019 MAX accidents. And the bill 
we are considering today will fix that 
broken system. 
It requires the FAA to approve au-
thorized representatives at all aviation 
manufacturers 
by 
examining 
their 
qualifications and character so that, 
when they are considering a proposed 
design, they will remember that public 
safety rests on their shoulders. 
Any person who interferes with an 
authorized 
representative’s 
perform-
ance of his or her critical duties on be-
half of the FAA will be subject to civil 
penalties going forward. 
It also imposes civil penalties for a 
manufacturer’s failure to disclose the 
details of a system like MCAS that ma-
nipulate flight controls without direct 
pilot input and for a manufacturer’s 
delivery of an airplane that does not 
conform to an FAA-approved design. 
The 
bill 
requires 
two 
FAA 
rulemakings that, together, will re-
quire manufacturers to provide the 
agency 
with 
thorough 
assessments 
measuring the risk created by changes 
to existing aircraft designs so FAA can 
ascertain whether a manufacturer has 
sufficiently minimized any given risk. 
The bill requires the FAA to hire 
more staff to rigorously review new de-
signs and authorizes enough funding 
for 100 of them. 
It also requires the FAA to imple-
ment a nonpunitive voluntary safety 
reporting system for FAA employees to 
report safety concerns, prohibits agen-
cy officials from talking with manufac-
turers about formal objections to FAA 
career employees’ decisions unless pub-
licly 
disclosing 
information 
about 
those communications, and it extends 
to manufacturers’ employees the same 
whistleblower protections that apply 
to airline employees today, and much 
more. 
I want to make it clear that this bill 
is not meant in any way to interfere 
with the victims or their families’ ac-
cess to the judicial system and all 
available 
remedies 
when 
tragedies 
occur. Compliance with the provisions 
of H.R. 8408 will not adversely affect 
any existing remedies available to fam-
ilies of the Boeing victims and any 
other future victims under State, Fed-
eral, statutory, or common law. Fami-
lies who have already suffered tragic 
loss must be able to seek compensation 
when their loved ones are injured or 
killed in aircraft crashes due to neg-
ligence or other wrongdoing. 
The 346 sons, daughters, brothers, sis-
ters, fathers, mothers who died on Lion 
Air flight 610 and Ethiopian flight 302 
placed their trust in a broken system. 
Today, we take the next big step to-
ward fixing that system. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber GRAVES, Aviation Subcommittee 
Chair 
LARSEN, 
and 
Subcommittee 
Ranking Member GRAVES
for their 
partnership in advancing this legisla-
tion, and I look forward to continuing 
to work with them and our Senate col-
leagues, and hopefully we can get it en-
acted into law this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8408, the Aircraft Certification 
Reform and Accountability Act. 
I want to thank Chairman DEFAZIO 
and Chairman LARSEN for working with 
us to put together this bipartisan bill. 
The Committee’s response following 
the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines 
tragedies has been to take the time 
that is necessary to understand all the 
contributing factors in these accidents. 
b 1515 
Throughout 
this 
process, 
I 
have 
taken the position that if the safety 
experts recommend improvement to 
our certification system, then Congress 
should act. 
We now have the benefit of a number 
of nonpartisan reviews by aviation 
safety experts confirming that mul-
tiple factors were involved. There is 
only so much the United States can do 
to influence factors outside of our bor-
ders, but the experts identified issues 
to address those things that are within 
our control and made recommenda-
tions to improve our system, and that 
is the focus of this bill. 
We can all agree that the United 
States and the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration has to—must—continue 
to be the gold standard in aviation. 
The safety of the traveling public de-
pends on that, but so does our econ-
omy, our competitiveness, and hun-
dreds of thousands of American jobs. 
Plain and simple, we can’t remain 
the gold standard if our system isn’t 
safe. And one reason for our achieve-
ments in aviation has been our ability 
to leave partisan politics at the door 
and work together on critical safety 
issues, and that is what we have done 
today in this bill. 
This bill before us today is going to 
require additional improvements be-
yond those which the FAA and Boeing 
have 
already 
undertaken. 
These 
changes are going to make our safe 
system even safer. 
To be clear, the experts have con-
cluded that the current system does 
not need to be dismantled, but that we 
can and should take action to improve-
ment. 
H.R. 8408 thoughtfully addresses the 
multiple contributing factors involved 
in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines 
accidents that are within our control, 
as well as the many expert rec-
ommendations to improve safety with-
in our own system. 
This is a well-reasoned, comprehen-
sive, and bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Washington (Mr. LAR-
SEN), the subcommittee chairman. 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
8408, the Aircraft Certification Reform 
and Accountability Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5846 
November 17, 2020 
This comprehensive, bipartisan legis-
lation will help improve the U.S. air-
craft certification process, strengthen 
Federal Aviation Administration over-
sight, and ensure the safety of air trav-
el. 
As 
chair 
of 
the 
Aviation 
Sub-
committee, I am very pleased that this 
critical legislation is now before this 
Chamber for a vote. 
After two tragic Boeing 737 MAX 
crashes, the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee launched a thor-
ough investigation into the design, de-
velopment, and certification of the 737 
MAX. 
Since March 2019, the committee has 
received more than 500,000 pages of doc-
uments, held five oversight hearings, 
interviewed key employees at Boeing 
and the FAA, and listened to testi-
mony from victims’ families and from 
several whistleblowers. 
The resulting Aircraft Certification 
Reform and Accountability Act im-
proves aviation safety culture, en-
hances 
transparency 
and 
account-
ability, addresses undue pressure on 
employees acting on behalf of the FAA 
within an aviation manufacturer, and 
reinforces the importance of human 
factors in aircraft design and certifi-
cation. 
The 346 victims of the two tragic 
crashes and their families have always 
remained at the forefront of this com-
mittee’s work. 
A vital part of the committee’s proc-
ess was the advocacy of the victims’ 
families. For nearly 2 years, the fami-
lies have championed necessary re-
forms to the FAA certification process 
to ensure that no other families experi-
ence such unthinkable loss. 
This bill reinforces the integrity of 
the FAA and U.S. aviation manufac-
turing. 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO for his 
leadership. I thank Ranking Member 
GRAVES of Missouri of the full com-
mittee for his leadership. And I thank 
the ranking member of the Aviation 
Subcommittee, Mr. GRAVES
of Lou-
isiana, for his leadership on coming to-
gether in a bipartisan way to make 
this bill a reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. GRAVES), the ranking member of 
the Aviation Subcommittee. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I really can’t dispute many of 
the previous speakers’ comments. The 
bottom line is that the aviation indus-
try, the aviation mode of transpor-
tation is the safest mode of transpor-
tation. It is the safest way to travel. 
And the United States has the gold 
standard in regard to aviation safety. 
However, we are all aware of two 
very tragic accidents that resulted in 
346 lives that were lost, 346. Just be-
cause we have the best, we have the 
safest, does not mean that we should 
ever stop striving for better, we should 
ever stop striving for perfection. 
Mr. Speaker, we had five hearings on 
this legislation. There were numerous 
expert panels that were put together to 
review this, to extract every single les-
son learned. 
I thank the acting administrator at 
the time, Dan Elwell—and I want to 
congratulate him on his retirement— 
for his steady hand in ensuring that, as 
we move forward, we base our decisions 
on facts. I thank him for some of the 
changes within the FAA to ensure that 
we apply lessons learned. 
Mr. Speaker, as previous speakers 
noted, this legislation is the result of 
all of these nonpartisan, independent 
expert reviews. We took the lessons 
learned and we adapted it into legisla-
tion to make sure that we can, as I 
said, continue to strive for perfection; 
to continue to focus on, as my friend 
Mr. LARSEN
noted, the families; to 
keep a face on this; to ensure that we 
never subject future families to the 
same losses that we had in this case. 
And that is just what we did. 
I thank Michael Stumo, one of the 
leaders of the families who called us 
often and reminded us what it was that 
we were doing. We were focusing on 
safety because this is about people, 
about real lives. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill has a number 
of improvements, as I noted, including 
ensuring that safety management sys-
tems are applied by manufacturers and 
better controls over project manage-
ment. The bill integrates project re-
view within the FAA to make sure that 
different entities within the FAA are 
aware of what the others are doing. 
The bill ensures that there is disclo-
sure of safety critical information in 
systems, including close inspection and 
review of new or novel technologies 
that are introduced into the design to 
ensure that we fully understand the 
impact of those. It ensures that there 
is conformance with the FAA design 
type; meaning that you can’t come in 
and simply amend the design type if 
you are making significant changes to 
the aircraft or if the aircraft design 
evolves over time to where if initially 
it couldn’t simply be an amended de-
sign. 
Mr. Speaker, it also includes some-
thing that is very important. It inte-
grates human factors, ensuring that we 
understand how humans, how pilots 
and others will behave in the instance 
of some type of safety issue on aircraft. 
Mr. Speaker, when an aircraft has a 
problem, you can’t simply pull it over 
to the side of the road and check it out. 
We have to make sure that this con-
tinues to be the safest mode of trans-
portation. We have to continue to en-
sure that the United States truly has a 
gold standard. 
I thank Chairman DEFAZIO and my 
friend, Chairman LARSEN, as well as 
full 
committee 
Ranking 
Member 
GRAVES of Missouri, for the work on 
this bill because this bill didn’t start 
out as something that was bipartisan 
that everybody was on board with, but 
it did evolve to this point. Candidly, 
there are few perfections in here that I 
would like to see, but this is a really 
good bill, and it does simply take the 
recommendations, the findings of the 
expert reports and it does turn this 
into legislation. 
I thank all my friends for working 
together on this. I thank Holly and 
Hunter, whose baby Theo didn’t com-
ply with our schedule in this legisla-
tion, for all of their hard work here. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, H.R. 8408 addresses the nonpartisan 
expert safety recommendations to im-
prove the FAA’s aircraft certification 
process in the aftermath of tragic Lion 
Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents in 
2018 and 2019. 
This bill is responsible, comprehen-
sive, bipartisan, and it is going to im-
prove aviation safety. 
I thank again Chairman DEFAZIO and 
Ranking Member GARRET GRAVES and 
the committee staff on both sides, with 
special 
thanks 
to 
Holly 
Woodruff 
Lyons, Hunter Presti, Jamie Hopkins, 
Corey Cooke, Jack Ruddy, and Paul 
Sass for their work on this important 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I, too, 
want to recognize the staff on both 
sides and the Members. Early on, this 
did appear like it could be a conten-
tious piece of legislation, but in the 
end we all came together in the public 
safety interest for needed reforms to 
this Federal agency and the process by 
which we certify aircraft. 
I thank the investigative staff of the 
committee, who put together an ex-
traordinary report. I also thank the 
aviation staff on both sides of the aisle 
for their work. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the tragic 
deaths of 346 people on two Boeing 737 MAX 
jet crashes in October 2018 and March of 
2019 were entirely preventable. As was said in 
the final report prepared by the Majority Staff 
of the House Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure on ‘‘The Design, Develop-
ment & Certification of the Boeing 737 Max’’ 
released on September 16, 2020, ‘‘The MAX 
crashes were not the result of a singular fail-
ure, technical mistake, or mismanaged event. 
They were the horrific culmination of a series 
of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s 
engineers, a lack of transparency on the part 
of Boeing’s management, and grossly insuffi-
cient oversight by the FAA—the pernicious re-
sult of regulatory capture on the part of the 
FAA with respect to its responsibilities to per-
form robust oversight of Boeing and to ensure 
the safety of the flying public.’’ 
The 737 MAX tragedies require us to make 
sure that certification alone can never become 
a legal shield for aircraft design or manufac-
turing defects. Even with the enactment of this 
legislative reform, it will be impossible to elimi-
nate all risk. Indeed, as the Committee’s re-
port shows, ‘‘FAA management has undercut 
the authority and judgment of its own technical 
experts and sided with Boeing on design 
issues that failed to adequately address safety

issues and appear to have violated FAA regu-
lations or guidance, in some instances.’’ 
We need to incentivize the industry to do 
everything possible to ensure the safety of 
their planes and components. H.R. 8408 
seeks to accomplish this goal by making both 
manufacturers and regulators responsible for 
updating and upgrading safety and technology 
standards as new systems and information are 
developed and become available. 
I also want to make it clear that this bill is 
not meant, in anyway, to interfere with victims’ 
or their families’ access to the judicial system 
and all available remedies when tragedies 
occur. Compliance with the provisions of H.R. 
8408 will not adversely affect any existing 
remedies available to families of the Boeing 
victims and any other future victims under 
state or Federal statutory or common law. 
Families, who have already suffered tragic 
loss, must be able to seek compensation 
when their loved ones are injured or killed in 
aircraft crashes due to negligence or other 
wrongdoing. 
Many of the families of the Boeing 737 MAX 
crashes attended hearing after hearing as the 
House Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure conducted a comprehensive review 
of everything that went wrong with the 737 
MAX. They were there to remind us of the 
human element—that we are here to work for 
the people. The bill does nothing to interfere 
with or affect the ability of the families of vic-
tims of air tragedies to hold industry account-
able, now or in the future. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 8408, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
FEMA ASSISTANCE RELIEF ACT 
OF 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8266) to modify the Federal cost 
share of certain emergency assistance

Disaster Relief and Emergency Assist-
ance Act, to modify the activities eligi-
ble for assistance under the emergency

SEC. 5. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS 
AND HOUSEHOLDS. 
Section 408(f)(3)(J)(iii) of the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As-
sistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5174(f)(3)(J)(iii)) is 
amended by striking ‘‘2 years’’ and inserting 
‘‘3 years’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
8266, the FEMA Assistance Relief Act, 
as amended. 
H.R. 8266 is a bipartisan bill I intro-
duced with Subcommittee Chair TITUS, 
Representatives 
THOMPSON, 
LOWEY, 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, WALDEN, and several 
other Members representing districts 
ravaged by natural disasters this year. 
Simply put, this legislation would in-
crease the Federal cost share of certain 
assistance provided by the Federal 
Emergency 
Management 
Agency, 
FEMA, under the Stafford Act. 
Specifically, the bill would address 
the Federal cost share for all declared 
disasters in the year 2020, the year of 
the pandemic, the year of record 
wildfires, the year of record floods, the 
year of more hurricanes than any other 
time in history, from 75 percent to not 
less than 90 percent and further adjust 
the Federal cost share for COVID-re-
lated declarations to 100 percent. 
Communities across this country, in-
cluding my district in Oregon, continue 
to struggle to recover from the twin 
crises: Combating the COVID–19 pan-
demic while also facing extreme weath-
er events, fires, and other issues that 
science has linked to climate change. 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial 
governments are seeing their public 
health 
emergency 
management 
re-
sources stretched thin or outright de-
pleted and overdrawn. It is Congress’ 
responsibility to ensure they have the 
financial support necessary to address 
these crises. 
I first implored President Trump to 
direct FEMA to authorize a Federal 
cost share adjustment back in March 
when he invoked a rarely used clause 
in the Stafford Act to declare the pan-
demic a national emergency and issue 
a Presidential emergency declaration 
for each State and many protectorates 
and Federally recognized Tribes. 
Thus far, both the President and the 
agency have not taken action to shift 
the cost share more equitably on to the 
shoulders of the Federal Government, 
who invoked this clause in an unprece-
dented way. 
While Federal regulations allow for 
Presidential or administrative cost 
share adjustment, the requests from 
the National Governors Association, 
National Conference of State Legisla-
tures, the National Association of 
Counties, National Emergency Man-
agement Association, International As-
sociation of Emergency Managers, and 
others for this much-needed assistance 
have gone unanswered in a time when 
States and locals have seen their reve-
nues all but disappear due to the im-
pact of public health measures taken 
to combat the pandemic.

On several occasions during the last 
15 years, Congress has seen fit to statu-
torily increase the Federal cost share 
of FEMA assistance, notably after a 
couple of hurricanes. 
This year has already seen the busi-
est tornado, hurricane, and wildfire 
seasons on record. The burdens of re-
sponse and recovery to an unprece-
dented number of natural disasters are 
compounding atop a global pandemic. 
If ever there was a moment for an-
other statutory adjustment, 2020 is the 
year in which that should happen. 
Further, by establishing a national 
emergency and pulling FEMA into the 
response in mid-March, the President 
invoked section 501(b) of the Stafford 
Act, which declares the ‘‘United States 
exercises exclusive or preeminent re-
sponsibility and authority.’’ One would 
think that exclusive and/or preeminent 
responsibility and authority would jus-
tify the 100-percent cost share for 
COVID-related expenses. 
H.R. 8266 would provide much-needed 
assistance to ease the financial burden 
on State, local, Tribal, and territorial 
communities that have been granted 
Stafford declarations this year. 
Additionally, this bill clarifies and 
encourages FEMA to reimburse for per-
sonal protective equipment and dis-
infection costs for public schools, pub-
lic transit, courthouses, and other tra-
ditionally eligible nonmedical entities, 
which were excluded from eligibility in 
FEMA’s September 1 interim policy— 
for some unknown reason—on eligible 
public 
assistance 
expenses 
tied 
to 
fighting the spread of the global pan-
demic. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, in particular, 
Congressmen PAYNE and MALINOWSKI, 
members of the committee, for their 
efforts to address this with a stand- 
alone bill. I am glad we are able to ad-
dress the matter here. 
Just to reflect for a moment on the 
wildfires in the West, these were 
wildfires of a magnitude and intensity 
never seen in recorded history and, ac-
cording to some scientists who have 
been studying our forests through his-
tory, prehistory. 
In my district, we had three major 
conflagrations, one just upriver from 
my house, which took out the entire 
town of Blue River, and toward the 
McKenzie River Corridor. The winds 
were gusting to hurricane force. Hu-
midity dropped to 6 percent. That is 
the Sahara Desert; that is not Oregon. 
They blew down the McKenzie River 
Corridor. Forest scientists say there 
has never been what is called a stand- 
replacement fire event in that corridor 
in history or prehistory. It is wet, it is 
damp, but not this year. These condi-
tions were unbelievable. 
In the north part of my district and 
in KURT SCHRADER’s district, we lost 
three towns and had massive damage. 
Then down in southern Oregon, not 
in a forested area, in Representative 
WALDEN’s district, the towns of Phoe-
nix and Talent were dramatically im-
pacted. Many, many residences and 
businesses were lost. One of the fires 
was set by a transient in a field, but 
again, the winds were blowing at a 
level never, ever seen before out of the 
northeast. 
The city manager of Talent said to 
me: You know, I grew up in southern 
California. This looks to me like the 
worst that southern California ever 
had in the past. This doesn’t look like 
Oregon. 
These things are due to the changing 
climate. There are going to be more of 
them, and we have to be ready. This 
bill at least will help with this year’s 
response. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This bill recognizes that 2020 has 
been an unusual year with multiple 
and layered disaster declarations, and 
it would adjust the Federal cost share 
for disasters declared this year, includ-
ing for COVID. 
H.R. 8266 would also clarify the types 
of FEMA assistance available for the 
COVID 
response, 
including 
testing, 
food distribution, and personal protec-
tive equipment, and it would strength-
en oversight of these funds. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman 
DEFAZIO for his work on this bill, as 
well as his staff, and many other Mem-
bers who have contributed. I urge sup-
port of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8266, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
additional requests for time, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE). 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 8266, the 
FEMA Assistance Relief Act of 2020. 
This year has been difficult for every-
one, but our small local governments 
have been some of the hardest hit due 
to extreme losses in tax revenue. This 
is especially true in southwest Ala-
bama. 
In September, Hurricane Sally made 
landfall 
in 
Gulf 
Shores, 
bringing 
record-breaking rainfall, over 30 inches 
in some places, and winds above 110 
miles per hour. Just weeks later, Hur-
ricane Zeta passed through our State,

causing further devastation, especially 
in rural parts of Mobile, Washington, 
and Clark Counties. 
That is right. I have had two hurri-
canes in one season in my district. 
These storms caused tens of millions of 
dollars in damage and left significant 
amounts of debris. 
This would be difficult on a small 
town’s budget in a normal year, but 
pandemic-related issues coupled with 
unexpected costs from severe storm 
damage will further stretch the already 
limited budgets of many of our commu-
nities. 
Already, a local government in south 
Alabama has made the difficult deci-
sion not to purchase a much-needed 
new police vehicle due to the impacts 
of COVID–19 and Hurricane Sally on 
their budget. 
The current 75–25 percent FEMA Fed-
eral-State cost share is simply unwork-
able in this challenging year. 
This important legislation will raise 
the Federal cost share of pandemic-re-
lated disaster relief to 100 percent and 
all other relief for disasters this year, 
including the hurricanes that have dev-
astated the Gulf Coast, to a minimum 
of 90 percent. Making this adjustment 
will help reduce the burden on our 
local communities and help strengthen 
the recovery process. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that Members 
from both sides will join me in sup-
porting this critical legislation. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES), my good friend, 
who I understand has a little different 
viewpoint on this bill than some of us 
but definitely deserves the right to be 
heard. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
ROUZER), 
my 
friend, for yielding. 
Look, I understand I am in the mi-
nority on this legislation in more ways 
than one. 
Mr. Speaker, years ago, there was a 
movie called ‘‘Brewster’s Millions.’’ 
‘‘Brewster’s Millions’’ featured Richard 
Pryor, John Candy, and others. In that 
movie, Richard Pryor was tasked with 
spending $30 million in 30 days in order 
to get access to $300 million in inherit-
ance. So what he did in that movie is 
he just went out there and carelessly 
spent money hand over fist, just spend-
ing it irresponsibly and recklessly be-
cause it wasn’t his money. He didn’t 
have to really care about if it was 
spent in a wise or principled manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that 
perhaps we are doing a little bit of that 
here. 
I want to be clear: I agree that our 
local governments and our State gov-
ernments 
deserve 
relief, 
but, 
Mr. 
Speaker, in 2018, just 2 years ago, we 
actually passed, we enacted, section 
1232 of the Disaster Recovery Relief 
Act that requires that FEMA look at 
the cumulative impact of disasters in a 
region to determine what the cost 
share should be. So, the law already 
provides a mechanism to reduce the 
cost share. 
I agree that they have not done a 
good job implementing it, but I do be-
lieve it is important for us to ensure 
that local and State governments have 
some concern with the dollars that are 
being spent, some skin in the game. 
Lastly, Mr. Speaker, look, whether it 
is a State or local or Federal Govern-
ment, you have three options: you can 
reduce spending; you can raise taxes; 
or, you can incur debt. All we are doing 
is we are probably going to incentivize 
this irresponsible spending, and we are 
going to increase the Federal debt. I 
think that the better way to address 
this would be forcing FEMA to imple-
ment section 1232 of the DRRA law of 
2018 the way that we intended, there-
fore achieving a similar objective. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge that we revisit 
this legislation. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), 
the chairman, to close. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the 
time. I thought we just had that one 
additional speaker, or I wouldn’t have 
yielded back all my time. 
I would like to point out that after 
Katrina, the gentleman’s home State 
got 100 percent. 
In this case, when we are talking 
about COVID, there were unprece-
dented invocations of the Stafford Act 
for every State and every territory of 
the United States of America, and I be-
lieve that warrants the 100 percent for 
COVID, which has already occurred and 
is past tense. 
In addition, COVID has devastated 
local revenue sources for States that 
have sales taxes. Mine doesn’t. You 
know, their revenues are down phe-
nomenally, and for other reasons. 
I don’t really want to belabor this. 
We are going to win overwhelmingly. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding his time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Mr. 
GRAVES), 
my 
friend. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to quickly make 
note for the record that Hurricane 
Katrina was largely the result of the 
Federal Government’s actions, the dev-
astation that was caused, the loss of 
life. The Chief of Engineers of the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers acknowledged 
their fault in that incident. Yes, it was 
unique. 
I also want to make clear that I said 
that I don’t necessarily object to the 
outcome of the legislation, but I think 
the way of getting there is inappro-
priate. We need to have consistent 
standards on how to achieve the right 
cost share for different disasters. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8266 
will help communities recovering from 
recent disasters and support the na-
tionwide effort to respond to the 
COVID pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 8266, the FEMA Assistance 
Relief Act which will provide additional funding 
to state and local governments to help victims 
of disasters rebuild and will make an important 
difference in the lives of my constituents who 
are victims of the CZU Lightning Complex 
Fire. 
2020 has been a difficult year for so many 
Americans. As our nation grappled with the 
COVID–19 pandemic, California endured a 
record-breaking wildfire season. In my Con-
gressional District, the CZU Lightning Complex 
Fire burned for 37 straight days this summer, 
destroying nearly a thousand homes and forc-
ing 77,000 of my constituents to evacuate. 
The fires could not have come at a worse 
time for local governments who are facing 
major budget cuts due to the pandemic. Santa 
Cruz County projected a $23 million decrease 
in revenue, and the cost of the fires has 
placed further strain on its ability to help resi-
dents affected by the fires. The President de-
clared the fires to be a major disaster, pro-
viding much-needed federal funding, but 
FEMA only covers 75 percent of the cost of 
disaster relief, with state and local govern-
ments having to pick up the rest of the costs. 
The FEMA Assistance Relief Act increases the 
federal government’s share of the costs to 90 
percent, alleviating the financial burden on 
local governments and allowing them to focus 
on rebuilding their communities. 
I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary 
work of thousands of first responders who 
helped fight these terrible fires. Thanks to 
them and their work, the fires have long since 
been contained, but much work remains to be 
done to provide relief to my constituents. I’m 
proud to be an original cosponsor of the 
FEMA Assistance Relief Act to provide critical 
resources to communities around the country 
affected by natural disasters this year, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote for it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 8266, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
OCEAN POLLUTION REDUCTION 
ACT II 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4611) to modify permitting re-
quirements with respect to the dis-
charge of any pollutant from the Point 
Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant in 
certain circumstances, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4611, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
b 1545 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4611. The legislation introduced 
by Representative SCOTT PETERS clari-
fies that the city of San Diego, Cali-
fornia, can utilize the standard Clean 
Water and National Pollutant Dis-
charge 
Elimination 
System 
permit 
process to continue operation of the 
Point Loma Wastewater Treatment 
Plant with alternative standards. 
The legislation provides regulatory 
accountability and consistency to the 
city and has the support of surrounding 
localities, local public work depart-
ments, and water districts, as well as 
nongovernmental and environmental 
organizations. 
I am unaware of any opposition to 
this legislation currently. The Point 
Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant ap-
plies for and receives a waiver under 
the Clean Water Act to discharge 
wastewater with less than full sec-
ondary treatment—the baseline re-
quirement of the Clean Water Act. The 
facility qualifies for the waiver by 
meeting certain criteria and renews its 
application every 5 years. 
As part of a long-term effort, the 
Point Loma Wastewater Treatment 
Plant is working to reduce its dis-
charge into coastal waters. This effort 
involves water recycling and will di-
rect a portion of the facility’s dis-
charge. However, the facility’s dis-
charges into coastal waters will never 
be eliminated. 
To be clear, this legislation is not a 
waiver of all the requirements of the 
Clean Water Act, and the facility will 
need to comply with the other require-
ments of the act. 
I thank Representative PETERS and 
the city of San Diego for continuing to 
work with us on this legislation. I sup-
port this legislation and ask my col-
leagues to do the same. I reserve the 
balance of my time.

COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES, 
Washington, DC, November 12, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair, Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR DEFAZIO: In recognition of the 
goal of expediting consideration of H.R. 4611 
the ‘‘Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II,’’ the 
Committee on Natural Resources agrees to 
waive formal consideration of the bill as to 
provisions that fall within the Rule X juris-
diction of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. 
The Committee on Natural Resources 
takes this action with the mutual under-
standing that, in doing so, we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that 
the Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as the bill or similar leg-
islation moves forward so that we may ad-
dress any remaining issues within our juris-
diction. Our Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of conferees to 
any House-Senate conference involving this 
or similar legislation. 
Thank you for agreeing to include our ex-
change of letters in the Congressional 
Record. I appreciate your cooperation re-
garding this legislation and look forward to 
continuing to work with you as this measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely,

DEAR CHAIR GRIJALVA: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R. 4611, the Ocean Pollu-
tion Reduction Act II. I appreciate your deci-
sion to waive formal consideration of the 
bill. 
I agree that the Committee on Natural Re-
sources has valid jurisdictional claims to 
certain provisions in this important legisla-
tion, and I further agree that by forgoing 
formal consideration of the bill, the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources is not waiving 
any jurisdiction over any relevant subject 
matter. Additionally, I will support the ap-
pointment of conferees from the Committee 
on Natural Resources should a House-Senate 
conference be convened on this legislation. 
Finally, this exchange of letters will be in-
cluded in the Congressional Record when the 
bill is considered on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5851 
November 17, 2020 
Committee on Natural Resources on this im-
portant issue. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO 
Chair. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4611, the 
Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II. This 
bill would modify and simplify the city 
of San Diego’s required permitting 
process under the Clean Water Act to 
operate the city’s Point Loma Waste-
water Treatment Plant. 
The bill would make permanent a 
regulatory exemption under the Clean 
Water Act, and, in exchange, the city 
would promote water recycling and 
conservation efforts at its facility. 
This would result in increased water 
supply for the region and reduce treat-
ed wastewater discharges to the ocean. 
The bill will help ensure that San 
Diego has long-term certainty for its 
water supply, all while saving the city 
and regional ratepayers millions of dol-
lars by simplifying our permitting 
process. 
I urge support of this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PETERS). This is his legisla-
tion. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
For 40 years, the city of San Diego 
has 
treated 
the 
region’s 
sewage 
through the Point Loma Wastewater 
Treatment Plant. It is a chemically en-
hanced primary treatment facility that 
treats wastewater to a level that can 
be discharged into the ocean without 
harming the environment. 
The Clean Water Act generally re-
quires sewer systems to implement a 
secondary level of treatment. However, 
scientists at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography have consistently said 
that forcing San Diego ratepayers to 
pay billions of dollars to upgrade the 
Point 
Loma 
facility 
to 
secondary 
treatment would be a waste of money 
because the enhanced advanced treat-
ment the plant currently provides, 
combined with its 4-mile-long outfall, 
causes no harm to the ocean environ-
ment. In fact, the construction of a 
new facility along the coastline could 
do more harm than good. For these 
reasons, San Diego has been allowed to 
avoid building a new facility through a 
Federal waiver process at a cost of mil-
lions of dollars every 5 years. 
Water has always been in short sup-
ply in southern California, yet, during 
my first years on the San Diego City 
Council in the early 2000s, I was one of 
only three council members to support 
blackwater recycling to improve the 
reliability of our regional water sup-
ply. 
Even though all water is recycled, 
our opponents at the time dubbed it 
‘‘toilet to tap.’’ Now, however, we rec-
ognize that historic droughts, com-
bined with the shortage of melting 
snow, have made our water supply 
shortage a permanent challenge for the 
West. And today, San Diego’s proposed 
water recycling plan with the more ac-
curate moniker, the ‘‘pure water pro-
gram,’’ has widespread support from 
among local elected leaders, environ-
mental advocates, and State regu-
lators. 
In 2019, I introduced the Ocean Pollu-
tion Reduction Act II, or OPRA II, to 
support the dual goals of increasing 
fresh water supply and reducing pollu-
tion output to the ocean. 
Under OPRA II, the city of San Diego 
must demonstrate that the pure water 
program can produce 83 million gallons 
a day of water by 2036. This is an esti-
mated one-third of the entire city’s 
drinking water needs. Over the same 
period, the program is expected to re-
duce pollution discharge from the 
Point Loma plant by over 100 million 
gallons. 
Pure water will still require substan-
tial investment from San Diego rate-
payers; however, this bill replaces the 
complex 
and 
expensive 
secondary 
treatment waiver application with a 
simpler and more environmentally ef-
fective process if the city meets strin-
gent water recycling milestones. 
OPRA II has been a decades-long 
labor of love among the city of San 
Diego, its regional partners, and State 
and Federal Government. It will deploy 
cost-effective technology and will pro-
tect our region’s water sources, tech-
nology that could one day be deployed 
by other vulnerable communities to 
help address water shortage issues. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I thank my colleagues. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, the simplified permitting process 
under H.R. 4611 will provide more cer-
tainty to communities in the San 
Diego area, will increase water recy-
cling and conservation efforts there, as 
well as reduce treated wastewater dis-
charges into the Pacific Ocean. 
I urge support of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4611, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

CHILD CARE IS ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8326) to amend the Public Works 
and Economic Development Act of 1965 
to require eligible recipients of certain 
grants to develop a comprehensive eco-
nomic development strategy that di-
rectly or indirectly increases the ac-
cessibility of affordable, quality child 
care, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8326 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Child Care 
is Economic Development Act of 2020’’ or the 
‘‘CED Act’’. 
SEC. 2. COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOP-
MENT STRATEGIES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 302(a)(3)(A) of the 
Public Works and Economic Development 
Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3162(a)(3)(A)) is amend-
ed— 
(1) by striking ‘‘and’’ before ‘‘balances re-
sources’’; and 
(2) by inserting ‘‘, and directly or indi-
rectly increases the accessibility of afford-
able, quality child care’’ after ‘‘sound man-
agement of development’’. 
(b) GUIDANCE.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary of Commerce, in consultation with 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
shall issue guidance on implementing the 
amendments made by subsection (a) to in-
clude the accessibility of affordable, quality 
child care in a comprehensive economic de-
velopment strategy developed under section 
302 of the Public Works and Economic Devel-
opment Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3162). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include any extraneous 
material on H.R. 8326. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8326, the Child Care is Eco-
nomic Development Act, or the CED 
Act. 
Access to childcare is essential to 
economic development but it is often 
ignored in planning. This legislation 
changes that by making sure that local 
Economic Development Districts con-
sider the availability and accessibility 
of affordable, quality childcare when 
creating 
their 
Comprehensive 
Eco-
nomic Development Strategy. 
Job creation is an important part of 
economic development. But doing so 
without considering childcare leaves an 
enormous blind spot. For many com-
munities large and small, access to af-
fordable childcare remains one of the

largest barriers to job recruitment. If 
people cannot find quality and afford-
able childcare, they may not relocate 
to a region for a new job no matter how 
good the job may be. 
A report from the Center for Amer-
ican Progress found that more than 
half of American households live in a 
childcare desert. This is especially 
problematic in smaller and rural com-
munities where the rate of families 
with childcare deserts grows to three 
in five households without adequate 
childcare. 
If our economic development plans 
don’t consider childcare, we are lim-
iting the type of workforce that is 
available to compete for jobs and lim-
iting our economic development and 
competitiveness. Jobs that don’t work 
for working families don’t work for our 
communities. 
The childcare crisis in our country 
has 
been 
further 
exacerbated 
by 
COVID–19. As many as 4.5 million 
childcare slots may be permanently 
lost due to COVID–19, further reducing 
the 
limited 
supply 
of 
affordable 
childcare nationwide. With declining 
childcare options, many families are 
forced to reduce working hours or leave 
the workforce altogether, oftentimes 
leaving women with the greatest share 
household duties. 
Limited childcare availability has for 
years reduced women’s participation in 
the workforce, and the COVID–19 pan-
demic has pushed that even further. In 
September alone, four times as many 
women as men left the labor force— 
over 865,000 women in one month alone. 
And women and children who have re-
mained in the workforce report reduc-
ing their working hours by 20 to 50 per-
cent to provide childcare services to 
their families. 
Left unchecked, the childcare crisis, 
coupled with the COVID–19 pandemic, 
will reverse decades of progress for 
women’s equity and opportunity in the 
workforce, including reducing pay eq-
uity and opportunity gaps. 
While there is a lot we need to do to 
address the childcare crisis in our 
country, the CED Act provides us a 
first step forward by recognizing the 
intrinsic connection between economic 
development and access to childcare. It 
allows communities to identify their 
needs and strategies and forces an inte-
gration of early childhood needs into 
broader economic plans. 
I am proud to support this legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 13, 2020. 
Hon. PETER A DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, House Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R.8326, the ‘‘Child Care is Eco-
nomic Development Act of 2020.’’ In order to 
permit H.R. 8326 to proceed expeditiously to 
the House Floor, I agree to forgo formal con-
sideration of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H.R. 8326 with our mutual under-
standing that, by foregoing formal consider-
ation of H.R. 8326, we do not waive any juris-
diction over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and that our Com-
mittee will be appropriately consulted and 
involved as this or similar legislation moves 
forward with regard to any matters in the 
Committee’s jurisdiction. I appreciate your 
commitment to work with the Committee to 
address any outstanding issues as the bill is 
considered in the Senate. The Committee 
also reserves the right to seek appointment 
of an appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this or 
similar legislation that involves the Com-
mittee’s jurisdiction and request your sup-
port for any such request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I would ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation of H.R. 8326.

COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, 
Washington, DC, November 13, 2020. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,

House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS, Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R 8326, the Childcare 
is Economic Development Act of 2020. I ap-
preciate your decision to waive formal con-
sideration of the bill. 
I agree that the Committee on Financial 
Services has valid jurisdictional claims to 
certain provisions in this important legisla-
tion, and I further agree that by forgoing 
formal consideration of the bill, the Com-
mittee on Financial Services is not waiving 
any jurisdiction over any relevant subject 
matter. Additionally, I will support the ap-
pointment of conferees from the Committee 
on Financial Services should a House-Senate 
conference be convened on this legislation. 
Finally, this exchange of letters will be in-
cluded in the Congressional Record when the 
bill is considered on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Committee on Financial Services on this im-
portant issue. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8326 ensures that 
recipients of Economic Development 
Administration 
grants 
consider 
childcare availability as they develop 
comprehensive economic development 
strategies. 
These 
strategies 
currently 
incor-
porate various considerations, and this 
legislation 
would 
ensure 
childcare 
availability is also considered, which 
obviously helps women to contribute to 
the workforce. 
I urge support of this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1600 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, H.R. 8326 will ensure that childcare 
availability is incorporated in the eco-
nomic development strategies that are 
required for EDA grants. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Homeland, and 
Budget Committees, and Founding Chair of 
the Congressional Children’s Caucus, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8326, the ‘‘Child Care 
is Economic Development Act’’. 
First and foremost, I wish to thank my col-
league, Congresswoman ABBY FINKENAUER, 
for her leadership on this vital, bipartisan piece 
of legislation. 
H.R. 8326 requires grant applicants for cer-
tain public works and economic development 
projects to describe in their comprehensive 
economic development strategy how they will 
increase the accessibility of affordable, quality 
child care. 
By doing so, this bill makes it easier for 
child care to be an essential part of plans for 
local economic development projects. 
The child care industry has served as a cru-
cial backbone to the United States’ economy 
for decades, and it, too, continues to be 
rocked by the devastating effects of the 
coronavirus. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, we 
have seen a tremendous surge in the number 
of coronavirus cases across the United States. 
As of today, health authorities have identi-
fied more than 11 million COVID–19 cases 
throughout the United States since the start of 
the pandemic in January. 
Just last week, my home state of Texas sur-
passed 1 million cases and reported over 
20,000 related deaths. 
At the county level, Harris County, which in-
cludes my district, has reported more than 
175,000 cases and over 2,360 related deaths. 
Before the pandemic, Texas had more than 
11,000 child care operations. 
Yet, as a result of this disease, that number 
has reduced dramatically as these facilities 
have had to permanently close their doors. 
According to a survey conducted by the Bi-
partisan Policy Center, nearly two-thirds (63 
percent of parents across the United States 
had difficulty finding child care amidst COVID– 
19. 
Furthermore, about 47 percent of parents 
are concerned they won’t be able to afford 
child care when they can return to the work-
force. 
As we seek to regain control over this virus 
and poise our economy to rebound from the 
effects of the coronavirus, these closures will, 
without a doubt, affect parents and families 
who need to return to work yet no longer have 
a child care provider. 
Child care facilities provide an immense and 
unquestionable public value. 
Workers in every industry rely on child care 
centers to provide capable care for their chil-
dren, helping them juggle both parenting and 
employment responsibilities. 
The child care industry is even more essen-
tial to single parent households. 
In 2019, 15.76 million children lived with a 
single mother and approximately 3.23 million 
children lived with a single father. 
For these millions of families, child care is a 
lifeline.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5853 
November 17, 2020 
I have been a long-standing advocate for 
the child care industry because I understand 
the challenges many working families face 
when it comes to obtaining reliable, affordable, 
and quality child care. 
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have 
supported numerous initiatives that strengthen 
the viability of the child care sector. 
Most recently, I supported: 
H.R. 7327, the ‘‘Child Care for Economic 
Recovery Act’’; 
H.R. 7027, the ‘‘Child Care is Essential 
Act’’; and 
H.R. 7909, the ‘‘Ensuring Children and Child 
Care Workers are Safe Act’’. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, voicing my 
support for H.R. 8326 because it serves as a 
vital component to our nation’s economic re-
opening strategy. 
According to the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, approximately 50 percent of parents 
who have not yet returned to work cite 
childcare as a reason they have not returned. 
By passing H.R. 8326 today, we have the 
opportunity expand access to quality child 
care, so that individuals who are pursuing op-
portunities with these public works projects will 
not have to worry about choosing between 
employment opportunities and child care. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 8326, the ‘‘Child Care is Economic De-
velopment Act.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 8326. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

NATIONAL CHILDREN’S MUSEUM 
ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5919) to amend title 40, United 
States Code, to require the Adminis-
trator of General Services to enter into 
a cooperative agreement with the Na-
tional Children’s Museum to provide 
the National Children’s Museum rental 
space without charge in the Ronald 
Reagan 
Building 
and 
International 
Trade Center, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5919 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Children’s Museum Act’’. 
SEC. 2. NATIONAL CHILDREN’S MUSEUM. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Museum and Library Services Act 
of 2003 (Public Law 108–81) designated the 
Capital Children’s Museum, the predecessor 
to the National Children’s Museum, as the 
‘‘National Children’s Museum’’; 
(2) the National Children’s Museum oper-
ates under section 501(C)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 and is organized under 
the laws of the District of Columbia;

Museum is to inspire children to care about 
and change the world; and 
(4) the National Children’s Museum is lo-
cated in the federally-owned Ronald Reagan

National Children’s Museum for the oper-
ation of the National Children’s Museum in 
the approximately 32,369 square feet of space 
commonly known as suite C–001 (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘Space’) of the Ronald 
Reagan Building and International Trade 
Center for the duration of the retail space li-
cense agreement between Trade Center Man-
agement Associates, LLC, or a successor en-
tity, and the Museum, dated December 4,

ministration to provide rent for the Space; 
and 
‘‘(2) terminate such agreement if—

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 5919, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5919, the National Children’s 
Museum Act. This is a bill that I wrote 
and am grateful that the House is con-
sidering it today. I thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GRAVES 
for their support of this bill. 
This bipartisan bill would require the 
General Services Administration to 
enter into a cooperative agreement 
with the National Children’s Museum, 
a congressionally designated museum, 
to allow the museum to remain in the 
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter-
national Trade Center, as it is called, a 
federally owned building in the Na-
tion’s Capital, without charge for the 
duration of its existing lease. There is 
precedent for Congress’ requiring the 
General Services Administration to 
enter into a cooperative agreement for 
the use of a Federal building in the 
District of Columbia by a private mu-
seum without charge. The National 
Building Museum operates under such 
an agreement. 
This bill would allow the National 
Children’s Museum—the Nation’s first 
combination children’s museum and 
science center—to remain centrally lo-
cated in the Nation’s Capital for the 
benefit of the millions who visit and 
live in the city and the national capital 
region. Originally named the Capital 
Children’s Museum, the National Chil-
dren’s Museum was a staple in the Dis-
trict 
for 
decades. 
The 
institution 
opened in 1974 in a former convent on H 
Street Northeast. In 2003, Congress rec-
ognized the immense value of having a 
children’s museum in D.C. and offi-
cially designated the museum as the 
National Children’s Museum. Now the 
museum is bringing new and innova-
tive science, technology, engineering, 
arts, and math—or STEAM—exhibits 
to the Nation’s Capital, building on 
more than 30 years of educating D.C. 
children and families. 
Importantly, this bill would relieve 
concerns about the ability of the mu-
seum to survive the coronavirus pan-
demic. When the museum reopened in 
the Ronald Reagan Building and Inter-
national Trade Center this year, it im-
mediately 
attracted 
many 
visitors 
from throughout the national capital 
region and the Nation but was forced 
by the pandemic to close 18 days later. 
At this time, the museum remains 
temporarily closed until further notice. 
Still, the museum has continued to 
offer valuable STEAM resources to our 
children as they navigate these new 
challenging learning circumstances, in-
cluding over 75 at-home experiment 
and project video programs, monthly

podcasts, virtual field trips, and a Cli-
mate Action Heroes Digital Exhibit, 
among other resources. 
When the museum does open, capac-
ity will be restricted by at least 70 per-
cent under social distancing guidelines. 
Due to the anticipated reduction in ca-
pacity, the museum is estimating oper-
ating revenues will amount to only 30 
percent of the original goal for next 
year. Once returned to full capacity, 
the museum expects to serve half a 
million visitors a year, filling the 
STEAM content void in our Nation’s 
Capital and throughout the country. 
Despite the many benefits it brings 
to the Nation’s Capital, the museum is 
an outlier. It is the only congression-
ally designated museum expected to 
pay rent in a Federal building. This bill 
will allow the museum to remain in its 
current Federal location and allow 
staff to focus on bringing 21st century 
STEAM learning techniques to the Na-
tion’s Capital. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5919 directs GSA to 
provide rent relief to the National 
Children’s Museum currently housed in 
the Federal Ronald Reagan Building 
and International Trade Center. This 
bill will provide the National Chil-
dren’s Museum with similar relief af-
forded to other congressionally des-
ignated museums. I want to thank the 
fine gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS) for working with Ms. NOR-
TON on this bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER), 
who is my good friend from our region. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the National Children’s Mu-
seum Act. I give great thanks to ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON, RODNEY DAVIS, 
PETER DEFAZIO, and others who worked 
so hard on this legislation. 
Children’s 
museums 
are 
extraor-
dinary gifts for the life of the mind. We 
give our kids imaginations, dreams, 
possibilities, and whole new universes. 
Children’s museums change the trajec-
tories of their lives, and this is the leg-
acy of the National Children’s Museum 
in the Nation’s Capital. 
For decades, the museum was much 
beloved in the city. We often took our 
kids to the old convent in northeast 
D.C., but after moving in 2004 in order 
to grow, it has been fighting to get 
back to its roots ever since. 
We are lucky to have it located now 
in the Ronald Reagan Building and 
International Trade Center, again in 
the heart of D.C., but still it faces bar-
riers to reach its past success. 
Even though this august body made 
it a congressionally designated mu-
seum in 2003, it is the only such con-
gressionally designated museum ex-
pected to pay rent in a Federal build-
ing. With this bill, the nonprofit mu-
seum will be able to thrive and remain 
financially viable and accessible to our 
Nation’s children and work with the 
GSA in a way that makes sense. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends not 
just to vote for this bill, but after we 
have crushed the pandemic to bring 
their children and grandchildren to be 
thrilled and inspired by our National 
Children’s Museum. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), who is my good 
friend. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. 
ROUZER, for the time, and I do want to 
say thank you to my colleague and 
partner on the Highways and Transit 
Subcommittee, Ms. HOLMES
NORTON, 
and also to Mr. BEYER and all who 
work to make sure that we are here 
today to do what is right. 
We are here to make sure that the 
National Children’s Museum here in 
Washington, D.C., is able, because of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, to still be able 
to provide the entertainment and offer 
its offerings of activities to our kids, 
not just here in Washington, D.C., but 
throughout this great country. 
Today is the day we can celebrate in 
a bipartisan way so that we can allow 
GSA to give them a break, to help this 
community, and to help them find 
some sense of normalcy by being able 
to safely attend and participate in the 
activities of the National Children’s 
Museum. 
Pre-pandemic, the museum offered 
our children the ability to interact 
with exhibits focused on science, tech-
nology, engineering, arts and math. 
This allowed our kids to be able to fos-
ter a greater appreciation for STEM 
fields. 
Who knows? 
The next great member of the next 
pandemic response team could have 
had their interest piqued in working in 
science by going to the children’s mu-
seum here in Washington, D.C. 
We need STEM education now more 
than ever, and this is an opportunity to 
show the world that Republicans and 
Democrats in this institution can agree 
to get things done. 
I thank Ms. HOLMES
NORTON
for 
working with me and working with all 
of us on this very important piece of 
legislation, and I ask my colleagues to 
support it. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, H.R. 5919 will provide much-needed 
rental relief for the National Children’s 
Museum consistent with the policy for 
other congressionally designated muse-
ums. 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank 
Ranking Member DAVIS for his work on 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 5919, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SECURE FEDERAL LEASES FROM 
ESPIONAGE AND SUSPICIOUS EN-
TANGLEMENTS ACT 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
1869) to require the disclosure of owner-
ship of high-security space leased to 
accommodate a Federal agency, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1869 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Secure Federal Leases from Espionage 
And Suspicious Entanglements Act’’ or the 
‘‘Secure Federal LEASEs Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Government Accountability Office 
has reported that the Federal Government 
often leases high-security space from private 
sector landlords; 
(2) the General Services Administration 
collects highest- level and immediate owner-
ship information through the System for 
Award Management, but it is not currently 
required to collect beneficial ownership in-
formation and lacks an adequate system for 
doing so; 
(3) the General Services Administration 
and Federal agencies with leasing authority 
may not know if foreign owners have a stake 
in the buildings leased by the agencies, ei-
ther through foreign-incorporated legal enti-
ties or through ownership in United States- 
incorporated legal entities, even when the 
leased space is used for classified operations 
or to store sensitive data; and 
(4) according to a report of the Govern-
ment Accountability Office, dated January 
2017, that examined the risks of foreign own-
ership of Government-leased real estate, 
‘‘leasing space in foreign-owned buildings 
could present security risks such as espio-
nage and unauthorized cyber and physical 
access’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5856 
November 17, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 1869, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
b 1615 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1869, the Secure Federal Leases from 
Espionage and Suspicious Entangle-
ment Act, or the Secure Federal 
LEASEs Act, introduced by Senator 
PETERS from Michigan. 
In 2017, the Government Account-
ability Office published a report that 
found that several Federal agencies 
were unknowingly leasing office space 
in foreign-owned properties, some of 
which were used for high-security pur-
poses. While the General Services Ad-
ministration 
subsequently 
imple-
mented some policies to improve this 
lack of awareness, more needs to be 
done. 
S. 1869, the Secure Federal LEASEs 
Act, requires agencies to verify the 
identity of a property’s immediate or 
highest level owners if the space will be 
used for high-security purposes. It does 
this by requiring a property’s owner to 
identify and disclose whether they are 
a foreign person or entity, or if they 
are financed by foreign persons or enti-
ties, before the Federal agency enters 
into a new or amended lease agree-
ment. 
The bill also requires GSA and other 
agencies to include provisions in future 
leases for high-security spaces that 
will require owners to agree to having 
limited access, except where allowed 
by the tenant agency. 
To tackle the issue of foreign bene-
ficial owners, this bill also directs GSA 
to develop a governmentwide system 
that will enable Federal property man-
agers to collect individual information 
about each beneficial owner of a prop-
erty—including 
name, 
address, 
and 
some 
government-issued 
identifica-
tion—within 2 years of passage. This 
would allow for the identification and 
disclosure of foreign ownership that 
might otherwise elude detection under 
GSA’s current system. 
GSA has made some positive changes 
in response to the 2017 GAO report on 
this issue, but this legislation ensures 
that their best-practice policies are fol-
lowed uniformly by all agencies, par-
ticularly those with independent leas-
ing authority, and improved going for-
ward. 
While a lessor may be approved by 
the Federal Government, it may not be 
appropriate for an agency to lease a 
high-security space from the lessor. 
This legislation will require agencies 
to evaluate the risks of doing so. By 
developing a new, more rigorous bene-
ficial owner identification system, the 
Federal Government can be more vigi-
lant in ensuring that foreign govern-
ments do not have access to our most 
sensitive leased properties. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion and urge my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 1869, the Secure Fed-
eral LEASEs Act, would require enti-
ties that lease commercial space to 
high-security Federal agencies to iden-
tify any foreign ownership interest in 
the property. 
In 2017, the General Accountability 
Office issued a report revealing that 
there was insufficient information on 
the ownership of certain high-security 
federally leased buildings. 
The GAO recommended additional in-
formation be collected and reported to 
tenant Federal agencies to determine if 
security precautions are necessary. 
The General Services Administration, 
GSA, has already taken steps to ad-
dress the vulnerabilities raised by 
GAO, and this bill will help support 
those efforts. 
S. 1869 would require Federal agen-
cies with leasing authority to collect 
this information to improve the secu-
rity of Federal facilities. 
I thank the sponsors of this legisla-
tion for working with us on amend-
ments to this bill that will help to en-
sure its effectiveness. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 1869 will help identify 
any foreign ownership interest in pro-
posed leases for high-security agencies 
and improve the security of sensitive 
Federal facilities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
1869, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PREVENTING DISASTER 
REVICTIMIZATION ACT

covery Reform Act of 2018 to require

may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5953, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5953, the Preventing Disaster Revictim-
ization Act, introduced by Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure 
Ranking Member GRAVES
from Mis-
souri, Representative HUFFMAN, Rep-
resentative THOMPSON, Representative 
LAMALFA
from California, and Con-
gresswoman PLASKETT from the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
This legislation is designed to ensure 
disaster survivors are not revictimized 
by recoupment—or clawbacks—of Fed-
eral disaster assistance they have re-
ceived from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
Unfortunately, FEMA has repeatedly 
instructed disaster survivors to reg-
ister 
for 
individual 
assistance 
for 
which they were ultimately not eligi-
ble or granted qualified survivors more 
assistance than they qualified for. 
However, once FEMA identifies its 
error, it forces these survivors into a 
bureaucratic nightmare to appeal the 
debt that they now owe as a result of 
FEMA’s error. 
I am not surprised this still goes on, 
but I am disappointed that, given the 
technology and data we have at our 
fingertips, we have not been able to im-
prove this system for survivors, more 
so given how small a piece of the Fed-
eral disaster recovery apparatus this 
is. 
H.R. 5953 would waive survivors’ debt 
owed to the Federal Government in in-
stances where FEMA erroneously dis-
tributed assistance. 
This bill would also provide a similar 
waiver to disaster survivors who may 
be involved in legal action against a 
party deemed responsible for a disaster 
event. While this scenario is less com-
mon, it is currently playing out in 
California and jeopardizing disaster re-
lief for tens of thousands of families 
displaced by unprecedented wildfires of 
the last few years. 
Survivors have already been trauma-
tized by a disaster. The Federal Gov-
ernment should not force them to en-
dure a convoluted process to correct 
FEMA’s mistake or decision to pursue 
legal action years after the event 
against a liable party. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion and ask my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am the proud sponsor 
of H.R. 5953, the Preventing Disaster 
Revictimization Act. In the 2018 Dis-
aster Recovery Reform Act, Congress 
made the recovery process fairer and 
more equitable for most communities. 
This bill builds upon those efforts by 
ensuring that spent funds aren’t clawed 
back. 
When a disaster victim applies in 
good faith to FEMA for assistance and 
receives it from the Agency, we fully 
expect those individuals need to move 
quickly to use the assistance for eligi-
ble expenses, like home repairs, to 
speed up recovery, to begin rebuilding 
their lives. These victims should never 
expect FEMA to come back weeks or 
months or sometimes even years later 
and say: Sorry, we made a mistake. 
Now, you, the victim, have to give 
back those funds that we have already 
distributed to you and that you have 
already put to good use. 
To add insult to injury, FEMA’s in-
formation on how disaster victims can 
appeal these decisions is incredibly 
confusing, 
and 
it 
is 
insufficient. 
Through no fault of their own, many 
disaster victims are faced with debt 
collectors and the full force of the Fed-
eral Government seeking repayment. 
People acting in good faith to rebuild 
should not be revictimized because 
they relied upon FEMA’s determina-
tion that they were qualified for assist-
ance that they did receive. 
Unfortunately, disaster victims have 
experienced this recently in my own 
district in a few of my communities, 
and one in particular, Craig, Missouri, 
and in other communities all across 
the country. 
One constituent in my district was 
awarded just over $12,000 only to have 
FEMA show up after the money was 
spent to say that they messed up, that 
that individual didn’t actually qualify 
for the money, in their determination, 
and that it needed to be paid back. 
That is simply wrong, and it can dev-
astate someone who is already facing 
some very difficult circumstances. 
H.R. 5953 is going to clarify that if 
FEMA makes an error and there is no 
evidence of fraud, the victim will not 
be revictimized, and their debt is auto-
matically viewed as a hardship and 
waived. 
In addition, the bill would also re-
quire FEMA to report back to Congress 
on its error rates and tell us what they 
are doing to be more accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation to ensure that the govern-
ment does not revictimize disaster vic-
tims, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Puerto 
Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure 
Ranking 
Member 
SAM 
GRAVES for leading this bill to prevent 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency from being able to collect dis-
aster assistance funds that it has pre-
viously awarded to individuals and 
families who applied for Federal fund-
ing after they were affected by natural 
disasters. 
I think this bill, H.R. 5953, the Pre-
venting Disaster Revictimization Act, 
is more important than ever with the 
history we have in the past, with hurri-
canes and earthquakes here in the Na-
tion as well. And we are experiencing 
all of those examples that he just men-
tioned. 
b 1630 
This legislation is the result of the 
management of funding and poor rec-
ordkeeping practices, which are not the 
fault of those affected by natural disas-
ters. I truly believe that FEMA should 
be there to support individuals and 
families when they need it most, not 
revictimize them when they are start-
ing over. 
As an example, in Puerto Rico, the 
island was devastated by hurricanes in 
2017, then again by earthquakes earlier 
this year. We received more than $60 
billion in disaster recovery funding 
that has been awarded to Puerto Rico 
and my constituents. How, now, can we 
tell those rebuilding that some of the 
funding that was given to them was by 
mistake? How does the Federal Govern-
ment re-collect funding that was al-
ready used to buy materials to rebuild 
a home? It can’t. 
I think this legislation makes sure 
our constituents and our people are not 
on the hook for FEMA’s mistakes. I 
think this is a great opportunity to use 
those funds wisely. That is the reason I 
want to say thank you, again, to Rep-
resentative SAM
GRAVES
for leading 
this issue, protecting those who have 
already become victims, and I urge its 
passage. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, in closing, this bill, H.R. 5953, is 
going to ensure that disaster victims 
applying for FEMA assistance in good 
faith are not revictimized by the Agen-
cy if it realizes that it did make an 
error. 
Residents in north Missouri and 
across this country need to be able to 
rely on FEMA’s determination on eligi-
bility for assistance and not have to 
look over their shoulder as they re-
build, wondering if they are going to 
have to give back money sometime 
down the road. 
This bill also ensures that FEMA is 
working to prevent such errors in the 
future, making it a much better stew-
ard of the taxpayers’ dollars and vital 
disaster funding. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
very important piece of legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

PRELIMINARY 
DAMAGE 
ASSESS-
MENT 
IMPROVEMENT 
ACT 
OF 
2020 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4358) to direct the Administrator 
of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to submit to Congress a report 
on preliminary damage assessment and 
to establish damage assessment teams 
in the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4358 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preliminary 
Damage Assessment Improvement Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Preliminary damage assessments play a 
critical role in assessing and validating the im-
pact and magnitude of a disaster. 
(2) Through the preliminary damage assess-
ment process, representatives from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency validate infor-
mation gathered by State and local officials that 
serves as the basis for disaster assistance re-
quests. 
(3) Various factors can impact the duration of 
a preliminary damage assessment and the cor-
responding submission of a major disaster re-
quest, however, the average time between when 
a disaster occurs, and the submission of a cor-
responding disaster request has been found to be 
approximately twenty days longer for flooding 
disasters. 
(4) With communities across the country fac-
ing increased instances of catastrophic flooding 
and other extreme weather events, accurate and 
efficient preliminary damage assessments have 
become critically important to the relief process 
for impacted states and municipalities. 
SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Adminis-
trator of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency shall submit to Congress a report de-
scribing the preliminary damage assessment 
process, as supported by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency in the 5 years before the 
date of enactment of this Act. 
(b) CONTENTS.—The report described in sub-
section (a) shall contain the following: 
(1) The process of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency for deploying personnel to 
support preliminary damage assessments. 
(2) The number of Agency staff participating 
on disaster assessment teams. 
(3) The training and experience of such staff 
described in paragraph (2). 
(4) A calculation of the average amount of 
time disaster assessment teams described in 
paragraph (1) are deployed to a disaster area. 
(5) The efforts of the Agency to maintain a 
consistent liaison between the Agency and 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials 
within a disaster area. 
SEC. 4. PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Adminis-
trator of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency shall establish a training regime under 
section 206.33(b) of title 44, Code of Federal Reg-
ulations, within the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency to ensure preliminary damage 
assessments are conducted and reviewed under 
consistent guidelines. 
(b) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Administrator shall 
annually submit to Congress a report on the 
number and type of instances under which Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agency personnel 
have overturned decisions made by personnel in 
the field. 
(c) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 2 
years after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator shall submit to Congress a re-
port— 
(1) describing the establishment of disaster 
guidelines from Federal Emergency Management 
Agency personnel described under subsection 
(a); 
(2) assessing whether the duration of the de-
ployment of Federal Emergency Management 
Agency personnel to conduct a preliminary 
damage assessment is longer based on specific 
disaster conditions; and 
(3) containing legislative recommendations to 
improve the operation, deployment, and staffing 
of disaster personnel. 
(d) DEFINITION OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERN-
MENT.—For purposes of this Act, the terms 
‘‘State’’ and ‘‘local government’’ have the 
meanings given such terms in section 102 of the 
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) 
and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4358, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4358, as amended, the Prelimi-
nary Damage Assessment Improvement 
Act of 2020, introduced by Mr. KATKO 
from New York. 
H.R. 4358, as amended, would direct 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to produce a report examining 
the preliminary damage assessment, or 
PDA, process and establish a more con-
sistent training regime for FEMA per-
sonnel to effectively support these as-
sessments at State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial units of government. 
FEMA uses PDA findings in the wake 
of a disaster to determine the extent of 
damage and the subsequent unmet 
needs of individuals, businesses, and 
the public sector in the affected com-
munity. 
This bill would ensure greater con-
sistency for PDAs across FEMA’s 10 re-
gions by creating a training program 
with a goal of ensuring that data col-
lected and reviewed is done in a more 
consistent manner. 
As communities across the country 
experience 
more 
extreme 
weather 
events, timely and consistent PDAs 
have never been more important to the 
recovery process of disaster-declared 
areas. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion and ask my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4358 is going to im-
prove consistency in FEMA’s prelimi-
nary damage assessments to better 
help communities hit by disaster. 
Inconsistencies in FEMA training 
and personnel on the ground following 
a disaster often slow the recovery proc-
ess down dramatically. This bill is 
going to help ensure that there is more 
consistency within FEMA to support 
State and local communities as they 
navigate the preliminary damage as-
sessment process to determine eligi-
bility for assistance. 
Ultimately, the bill is about helping 
Americans impacted by disasters to get 
the help that they need sooner and 
more reliably. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
KATKO for his leadership and work on 
this piece of legislation. 
I urge support for the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-
ored to be the sponsor of H.R. 4358, the 
Preliminary Damage Assessment Im-
provement Act, along with the gen-
tleman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CUNNINGHAM). 
Preliminary damage assessments, or 
PDAs, play a critical role in assessing 
and validating the impact of a disaster. 
PDAs establish a foundation for fur-
ther assistance requests and are essen-
tial to the overall disaster relief proc-
ess. 
Inaccurate PDAs can impact the 
types of Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency, or FEMA, assistance 
available to communities following a 
disaster. 
Although FEMA is currently re-
quired to designate officials to support 
States and local communities in the 
PDA process, inconsistencies and turn-
overs in staffing can endanger access to 
critical relief. H.R. 4358 requires FEMA 
to report on FEMA’s role in the PDA 
process, including staffing and train-
ing. 
The bill also directs FEMA to take 
measures to ensure FEMA teams in-
volved in damage assessments are ap-
propriately 
trained 
and 
consistent.

ing in my district on Lake Ontario’s

I want to thank the American Flood 
Coalition for working with Representa-
tive CUNNINGHAM and me on this impor-
tant legislation. 
In closing, H.R. 4358 will help com-
munities across the country recover 
from disasters by improving the con-
sistency, dependability, and accuracy 
in the preliminary damage assessment 
process for FEMA disaster relief. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, H.R. 4358, as I mentioned earlier, is 
going to improve FEMA support for 
communities that have been hit by dis-
asters by ensuring more consistency in 
the preliminary damage assessment 
process. 
This bill will provide much better 
and faster government assistance to 
those whose lives have been impacted 
by floods, by hurricanes, and by so 
many other disasters that we see. 
Again, I want to thank and I want to 
commend the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO) for his leadership on 
this issue. 
I urge support of this important leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2914, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2914, the Housing Survivors of Major 
Disasters 
Act, 
introduced 
by 
Mr. 
ESPAILLAT
of New York and Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
This bipartisan legislation is aimed 
at reducing the bureaucratic burden 
placed on the disaster survivors when 
applying for Federal assistance. In the 
wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, 
and several other disasters in the con-
tinental 
United 
States, 
including 
wildfires near California or near Or-
egon, many disaster survivors have 
struggled to produce documents nec-
essary to prove their residency. This is 
particularly difficult when those disas-
ters have decimated all of their posses-
sions and records. 
Additionally, 
qualified 
survivors 
have had trouble registering for assist-
ance because they resided in homes 
passed down from generation to gen-
eration, in areas where title record- 
keeping hasn’t been adequately main-
tained to track these transfers. We 
have seen this issue time and again 
over the last decade and a half since 
Hurricane Katrina. 
FEMA has worked to address these 
challenges, but all efforts to this point 
have been ad hoc. H.R. 2914 formalizes 
the home certification process that 
FEMA has developed over the years, al-
lowing survivors to self-certify their 
residency with an expanded list of ac-
ceptable supported documentation. 
Survivors should not be expected to 
wade through bureaucratic red tape 
after their lives have been upended by 
a disaster. 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2914, and 
I would ask my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2914, which would help disaster victims 
verify residency and homeownership 
following a disaster. When disasters 
strike, essential property and posses-
sions are often destroyed. Disaster vic-
tims may not be able to easily obtain 
the paperwork needed for them to 
verify their residency, which delays 
needed assistance and the recovery 
process. 
This bill is going to clarify how the 
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy addresses alternate verification. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico, 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, for her work with 
Mr. ESPAILLAT of New York on this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge support of 
the legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT), my good friend. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Ms. NORTON for her contribu-
tions to this bill. I also want to extend 
my appreciation to Ranking Member 
GRAVES, 
Chairwoman 
TITUS, 
Sub-
committee Ranking Member KATKO, 
and committee staff for advancing this 
important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, Aaron Davis with the 
committee has been particularly help-
ful to my team, my staff, for the past 
year and a half to get this bill over the 
line. I know it would have been very 
difficult without his help and expertise. 
Since Hurricanes Maria and Irma 
devastated the island of Puerto Rico in 
the fall of 2017, I have visited the island 
several times, including with some of 
my congressional colleagues. I have 
spoken about this with the Congress-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico, 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, who has command of 
this issue. 
I have seen firsthand how public pol-
icy failures, our failures, have mani-
fested on the island. The Housing Sur-
vivors of Major Disasters Act, which I 
was proud to introduce with Congress-
woman 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, 
addresses 
some of these policy failures within the 
housing assistance programs our gov-
ernment deploys after natural disas-
ters. 
Some 
of 
these 
programs’ 
short-
comings have left thousands of Ameri-
cans in Puerto Rico without the means 
to rebuild their homes. Our bill aims to 
fix this. Currently, folks applying for 
assistance must furnish the deed of 
their home and/or notarized statements 
confirming the ownership of their 
home. 
Mr. Speaker, I vividly remember 
when Hurricane Sandy struck my home 
State of New York. The last thing peo-
ple were thinking about as they sought 
cover was where to find pieces of paper. 
And I can attest to the hurt of commu-
nities in Puerto Rico, Florida, and else-
where, in the wake of Hurricanes Maria 
and Irma were devastating. 
How can we expect families to find 
their deeds through rubble, destruc-
tion, and pain left by these storms? 
I am equally stretched by the idea 
that in the most vulnerable time and 
in the wake of destruction, the Amer-
ican Government is asking its citizens 
to find a notary before they can receive 
help. 
What is more, in places like Puerto 
Rico, thousands of individuals have no 
formal documentation, properties and 
ownership is passed on generation to 
generation, very often five and six gen-
erations. Given all these challenges, we 
crafted this bipartisan legislation to 
remove these barriers and establish 
new and more realistic standards for 
natural disaster survivors applying for 
Federal housing assistance. 
Along 
with 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO, 
Ranking Member GRAVES, my col-
leagues on the Committee, and Con-
gresswoman GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, I thank 
Senator ELIZABETH WARREN, her staff, 
and the numerous advocates for their 
tireless efforts in crafting and advanc-
ing this legislation over the past 2 
years, which is vital if we wish to make 
the people of Puerto Rico whole again 
and avoid similar calamities in the fu-
ture. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Puerto 
Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank again my 
ranking member and his staff for all 
the help to make this bill able to come 
to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2914, the Housing Survivors of Major 
Disasters Act. I thank Representative 
ESPAILLAT for leading this bill with 
me, to ensure not just people in the Na-
tion, but actually on the island of 
Puerto Rico, constituents that I do 
represent here in Congress and those 
affected by Hurricane Maria have in-
creased flexibility in providing owner-
ship of property when applying for Fed-
eral disaster funding. This was a major 
issue, and actually still is, many times.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5861 
November 17, 2020 
FEMA changed the way the docu-
ments were going to be accepted. Then 
they changed it again. And they did 
that more than five times during the 
course of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. 
So at the beginning, no papers were ac-
cepted, and then they changed it. So 
there was a difficult situation for peo-
ple, even in the center of the island. 
The documents that were requested 
in the north part of the island were dif-
ferent from those in the south, from 
those in the west, or in the country-
side. And that is the reason this bill is 
so important. 
This bill will provide necessary flexi-
bilities in the form of documents that 
individuals that were residing in the 
area during the natural disaster got to 
apply for disaster assistance. Individ-
uals may now use their driver’s license, 
deeds, or title to properties, utilities 
bills, or any of the 13 forms included in 
this bill as evidence of occupancy. 
In our case, you got many people 
that were affected. There was no doubt 
in terms of FEMA or the government 
that they were affected by the hurri-
canes, yet they did not have the papers 
at the time because they lose them be-
cause of disaster, and it was so difficult 
to get the government actually to use 
or redo those papers in time. So that 
took almost a year for many of the in-
dividuals affected by hurricanes in 
Puerto Rico just to provide the docu-
ments. 
As you may know, many of the dates 
expired. Most of the people didn’t qual-
ify then to receive the Federal funds 
that were available for disaster sur-
vivors. That is the reason H.R. 2914 also 
includes language for a report on the 
Disaster Housing Assistance Program, 
and how effective this program is. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy decided against using this disaster 
housing program in Puerto Rico fol-
lowing Hurricanes Irma and Maria, as 
the agency looks to other efficient pro-
grams to more effectively meet the im-
mediate needs of those affected by the 
two hurricanes. 
After those crazy 1 and 2 years, I may 
say that FEMA is helping and pro-
viding and using many of the forms 
that are now included in this bill to get 
those funds available. But, again, that 
can change if we don’t have it in law, 
and that is the reason this bill is so im-
portant. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Rep-
resentatives ESPAILLAT, and leadership 
on the Committee, as well as my rank-
ing member for supporting this legisla-
tion and working with me and my staff 
to improve this bill for the past year. I 
urge its passage. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2914 is going to 
help speed up the recovery following a 
disaster by helping disaster victims 
who have lost their personal records, 
and likely much more, to verify resi-
dency and homeownership. It is a very 
good piece of legislation, and I would 
urge support of this, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2914, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE

Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-

bill 
originally 
introduced 
by 
Rep-
resentative Mark Meadows of North

PENNSYLVANIANS NEED RELIEF 
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, 
Pennsylvania, like the rest of the coun-
try, is in the midst of both a public 
health and an economic crisis. This 
clearly isn’t news to anyone. We have 
been here for months now. 
My community—the people whom I 
represent—are looking to us—the peo-
ple whom they just cast ballots for—to 
comprehensively address this crisis. No 
matter which side of the aisle that you 
are on, Madam Speaker, we have a col-
lective responsibility to address the 
COVID pandemic from both the public 
health and economic perspective. 
I have been in my community talk-
ing to small business owners. Hard-
working Pennsylvanians need Federal 
support to weather this crisis. An eco-
nomic recovery cannot ignore the 
needs of our small businesses. That is 
not recovery at all. 
We need to pass my Paycheck Pro-
tection Small Business Forgiveness 
Act to expedite forgiveness for Pay-
check Protection Program loans for 
less than $150,000, which accounts for 
more than 90 percent of PPP borrowers 
across the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5863 
November 17, 2020 
This pandemic has taken lives and 
livelihoods from so many Pennsylva-
nians. We have the opportunity here to 
contain this virus and reverse this eco-
nomic fallout. I urge the passage of the 
Paycheck Protection Small Business 
Forgiveness Act. 
f 
HIRE VETS MEDALLION 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize two businesses in 
the Sixth District who have committed 
themselves to serving those who served 
our Nation. 
Tactical & Survival Specialties, In-
corporated, of Harrisonburg was award-
ed the Department of Labor’s HIRE 
Vets Medallion for the second year in a 
row, while Rubicon Planning of Roa-
noke earned this distinction for the 
first time. 
This prestigious honor is the only 
program within the Federal Govern-
ment that recognizes the meaningful 
and verifiable efforts undertaken by 
job creators to hire and retain our Na-
tion’s veterans. 
These two patriotic businesses under-
stand why veterans are such an asset 
to any workforce. 
According to a new Census report, 
veterans are more willing than civil-
ians to work longer hours and seek 
full-time employment. Further, by na-
ture, veterans work well in a team and 
have a sense of duty. They are dis-
ciplined, determined, and confident. 
They are trained to be problem-solvers, 
to adapt to changing situations, and 
they have a work ethic that is simply 
unmatched. For these reasons, I en-
courage all businesses to hire veterans. 
I applaud and thank Rubicon Plan-
ning and TSSi for being one of a select 
few awardees across the Nation who 
have already committed themselves to 
doing so. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. CRIST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, we need 
a COVID relief package, and we need it 
now. America is the richest country in 
the world. In fact, America is the rich-
est country in history. 
The CARES Act and the Fed pumped 
trillions of dollars into the economy 
this spring all while interest rates sank 
to historic lows. Our economic might 
was built for this moment—for this 
emergency. We can afford to meet the 
needs of our people and our economy in 
this pandemic. The economists, in fact, 
are urgently telling us that the prob-
lems of today vastly outweigh the po-
tential debt problems of tomorrow. 
This is especially true if inaction 
means laying off firefighters and peo-
ple losing their homes. 
We know we can help our people, and 
experts agree we should help our peo-
ple. But all my constituents know is 
that that has not happened. We have a 
sacred duty to get it done. 
f 
THE GROWING THREAT OF CHINA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
China continues to grow as a threat to 
freedom and human rights worldwide, 
and the People’s Liberation Army is 
one of their strongest tools. 
Unfortunately, large U.S. investment 
funds are shelling out millions of dol-
lars to Chinese companies that support 
the PLA. Individuals, banks, and com-
panies should not be putting our finan-
cial security at risk in order to inflate 
their financial portfolios. 
President Trump has been consist-
ently tough on China and recently 
issued an executive order banning 
American investment in these dan-
gerous companies. Similarly, Congress-
man BANKS, Congressman GALLAGHER, 
and I introduced the Stop Funding the 
PLA Act to prohibit American funds 
from going to entities that support 
China’s growing military presence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to join us in making this 
bill a permanent part of our strategy 
to hold China accountable. We should 
stand strong and never support the Chi-
nese Communist Party or any of its en-
tities. 
f 
COVID–19 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
just recently I read an article that in-
dicated that one in six Texans had been 
infected with COVID–19. As the study 
indicates in our local newspaper, that 
may be the case for States around the 
Nation. So I think it is extremely im-
portant that the General Services Ad-
ministration and the administrator of 
that department follow their adminis-
trative duties to allow the President- 
elect and Vice President-elect to be en-
gaged in COVID–19 briefings to save 
lives. 
In addition, I think it is crucial that 
we move forward on the Heroes Act 
that will provide for PPEs, will provide 
for payroll protection, and, of course, 
testing. Early on, testing was supposed 
to be 5 million a day. We have only 
tested 1.6 million a day minimally in 
the United States at least. We have to 
do more to save lives. Testing, social 
distancing, washing your hands, and 
wearing a mask will save lives. It will 
save lives here, and it will save lives 
across America. 
Finally, we must pass this legislation 
to help with the mental health stress 
people are facing and the economic 
stress they are facing. 
The General Services Administration 
needs to do their job and do it now so 
that the American people’s lives can be 
saved.

MAINTAINING EXPANSION OF 
TELEMEDICINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
with all the chaos and the activity 
going on around us, as we all know, we 
are all organizing our conferences. I 
wanted to touch on a couple of pieces 
of legislation that are out there right 
now that I am hoping, if we do some 
packages between now and the end of 
the year, we will all consider. And I 
love using the little boards because I 
think it sort of helps concentrate. 
One of the things, if there is any 
positive of what we have gone through 
in the pandemic, is the skepticism that 
was this body about telemedicine I 
hope is over, if you see the adoption 
rate of what has happened with, par-
ticularly, our seniors in embracing, 
having positive experiences, and actu-
ally even demanding telemedicine serv-
ices. 
My understanding is now that there 
is open enrollment in Medicare part D, 
that is actually now one of the com-
mon requests: What type of telemedi-
cine services do you provide and offer? 
If we understand, as a body, that the 
access for our seniors to use telemedi-
cine functionally—the expansion of the 
reimbursements, 
the 
rules—expires 
when the pandemic is declared over, I 
am desperately hoping that our broth-
ers and sisters around here on the right 
and the left hear that and understand 
if the community has embraced the 
price efficiency, the additional access 
to healthcare—that is, the telemedi-
cine—let’s make sure we don’t let it ex-
pire when the vaccine and those come 
onto the market, are widely adopted, 
and we start to see the declaration 
that the pandemic is over. So, this is 
just sort of the benchmark of starting. 
Now, if I am making the argument 
that telemedicine has expanded access, 
and we are seeing the opportunity for 
some real cost efficiency—because, as 
we know, it is always hard to talk 
about, but Medicare is one of the great-
est drivers of U.S. debt. As a matter of 
fact, it is the greatest driver of U.S. 
debt. 
It is demographics. Our brothers and 
sisters who are 65 years and older—and 
I am going to be there soon—earn this 
benefit. But the fact of the matter is, 
the unfunded liabilities, the substan-
tial portion of it, come out of the gen-
eral fund. It is a major driver. 
We should be excited that we had a 
proof of concept during this sort of 
miserable several months, that it ex-
panded access. We are seeing the price 
efficiency.

November 17, 2020 
And the skepticism that seniors were 
going to have discomfort on using 
FaceTime and other things on their 
electronic devices, the arrogance of 
this place was wrong. We underesti-
mated our fellow Americans in their 
ability to use the technology. 
Now, the next wave of what else we 
can be doing to actually expand, we 
have something that we have intro-
duced called the Safe Testing at Resi-
dence Telehealth, because we had to 
come up with a title that would create 
the word ‘‘START,’’ as we often do 
around here. 
As you all saw, about 2 months ago, 
there were some home COVID tests 
that received approval. If we would tie 
those home COVID tests with telemedi-
cine, those who are vulnerable in our 
communities could actually not have 
to risk getting in their cars, being part 
of the vulnerable population going to a 
clinic or the drive-through, or other 
things where there is testing. They can 
do it at home with these home test kits 
that are approved. We think that is 
part of the concept of the expansion of 
what is telemedicine. 
If we like this, I can expand the 
thought experiment: Americans who 
want to do their COVID tests at home 
and then use telemedicine as part of 
the experience, should that be allowed? 
Of course, it should. 
Why wouldn’t you also go a little bit 
further? I don’t have a board on this 
next one, but we have talked about it 
here, the ability to use technology also 
to help us be part of that expansion of 
telemedicine. This could be everything 
from the oxygen patch to the portable 
EKG. 
My understanding is that there is an 
American company coming up with a 
smartwatch that is going to do your 
oxygen, your temperature, your pulse 
rate, even your blood pressure. It turns 
out those things, put into an algo-
rithm, can do some pretty amazing 
things 
to 
help 
you 
manage 
your 
healthcare. 
That is, in many ways, the future of 
telemedicine. It is not just talking to a 
healthcare professional. It is the abil-
ity to use technology to watch your-
self, to keep yourself healthy, to diag-
nose if you are catching something, 
and then use that information with 
your healthcare professional. 
These are pieces of legislation that 
have 
demonstrated 
they 
are 
here. 
Adoption, particularly with seniors, I 
am hoping that the body thinks about 
it. If we do any type of stimulus or 
COVID package between now and the 
end of the year, that we think about 
telemedicine and keeping it perma-
nently with us, the expansion. 
Let’s walk through a couple of other 
things. 
Another piece of legislation we have 
is, if many of us have seen the eco-
nomic, emotional, you know, future in-
come, the damage we did by shutting 
down so much of our society, economi-
cally, in trying to slow down the 
spread of COVID, how do we help busi-
nesses stay operating, keep their doors 
open, but also know they are providing 
a safe workplace? We have a tax credit 
that would help those businesses pro-
vide testing but also get that partial 
reimbursement, that partial credit, 
quickly. 
We came up with a quirky idea. 
Every couple of weeks or every month, 
most businesses have to contribute on 
the payroll tax. Put the credit there so 
the cash comes back in very, very 
quickly, or the credit comes in very 
quickly. 
We have a workplace testing tax 
credit piece of legislation. If we are 
going to move forward with a package, 
something like that should be there be-
cause if we are trying to keep our com-
munities open but keep them healthy, 
we need that testing at the small busi-
ness level. This makes it affordable. 
Another thing I would like us to 
think about, and this is more global, 
the White House, the administration, 
those of us in this body, the resources 
we put forward months ago, and then 
the management of Operation Warp 
Speed, other than the stock market, I 
thought we would see more collective 
joy on how quickly we are moving to a 
vaccine. If it is true that there is a vac-
cine out there that was—what?—94.5 
percent effective in its first statistical 
abstract, this is wonderful. We have 
done something that has never been 
done before, bringing this type of vac-
cine and heading toward approval and 
emergency authorization. 
If this is our benchmark, that we 
know we have light at the end of this 
tunnel, then we need to also now step 
up and do the things that spur the eco-
nomic expansion once again. Ameri-
cans deserve to live in a healthy, pros-
perous country. If the vaccine, Oper-
ation Warp Speed, is working, which 
now we know we have multiple vac-
cines that are on the cusp of being here 
with amazing efficacy, it is time to do 
some other things that make the econ-
omy grow. 
The first one I want to give is just a 
simple thought. When we did tax re-
form, we stopped something that was 
part of the ObamaCare financing. The 
ACA had a mechanism where your abil-
ity to deduct your healthcare expenses 
was going to go up. You didn’t get to 
deduct anything until your healthcare 
expenses were over 10 percent of your 
income. That was one of the mecha-
nisms that kicked a lot of seniors, par-
ticularly, in the teeth, and that was 
part of the ACA financing. 
When we did tax reform at the end of 
2017, we held it for a couple more years 
at 7.5 percent. If you had $100 of income 
and $7.50, the next portion of that, you 
get to deduct. If you are under that, 
you don’t get to take it off your taxes, 
if that helps explain it. 
We have a piece of legislation that 
for the next 2 years would make it that 
you only have to hit 5 percent. Then 
every incremental dollar above that, 
you could deduct. 
Considering how many folks in the 
United States this year, and poten-
tially into next year, are going to have 
some unusual healthcare expenses, why 
wouldn’t we do this as part of the pack-
age? 
The other part is: Then, let’s hold it 
at the 7.5 percent for perpetuity. Let’s 
make that permanent. 
I know that it will offend some folks 
who wanted to raise it because that 
was one of the financing mechanisms of 
the ACA, ObamaCare, to raise those 
functionally—take away that tax ben-
efit to folks who had high medical ex-
penses. But I think that we could all 
agree, 
with 
what 
we 
have 
been 
through, this would be a healthy thing, 
particularly for those who have had 
some difficulty this year and into next 
year. 
The last one I want to give you is— 
in some ways, it is a little bit of a 
quirky idea, but I want to beg of the 
body to think about what we can do to 
spur economic expansion, to spur the 
animal spirits, the investment in our 
society, in our country, and into our 
communities but without piling on the 
debt. 
We all know a number of the things 
we did this year were necessary. These 
were unprecedented times. But we are 
going to have to start paying for this. 
The amount of interest costs, the Fed-
eral Reserve creating liquidity, eventu-
ally, that does dial back. We will have 
to, in the future, pay for these times. 
So, what do you do to spur the econ-
omy? 
We have a quirky idea that would 
say: If you would be willing to buy an 
asset, make investments in plant and 
equipment, do those sorts of things 
that, in today’s world, I am buying this 
hoping I get traditional capital gains 
in the future—but the problem with 
capital gains tax holidays, from a con-
ceptual standpoint, is you are often 
being given a discounted tax rate on 
gains you have already produced. How 
about you get those people who are 
willing to invest around the country to 
invest money in the hope that what 
they buy today will go up in value in 
the future? It is not guaranteed. 
The idea is if we are seeing with the 
Federal Reserve and the Beige Book, 
and many of these other things, that 
there are stunning amounts of cash sit-
ting in bank accounts all around this 
country that we need circulating, that 
we need that velocity back into our so-
ciety and our communities, something 
that might be a fun incentive is saying: 
If you will buy assets, if you will invest 
in plant and equipment, if you will 
take a risk today, we don’t know, we 
can’t guarantee it, but a couple of 
years from now, if that value goes up 
and you sell, you will get a discounted 
capital gains tax rate because you in-
vested during this window when we 
needed to functionally goose the econ-
omy along. 
We wanted to make sure that the 
curve that we are seeing, where our 
brothers and sisters have work oppor-
tunities, and the number of small busi-
nesses that disappeared permanently,

that those small business owners who 
now have lost their businesses have ac-
cess to investors who are willing to 
give them another chance. 
The beauty of this is it doesn’t re-
quire a large check from the Treasury 
today. We are sort of saying: Take a 
risk on the American people. Take a 
risk on our economy today. A couple of 
years from now, if it worked, you get a 
benefit. 
We need to be looking more for ideas, 
I believe, like this that we can dem-
onstrate a stimulus into our society 
and our communities without imme-
diately putting ourselves more into 
debt. 
b 1815 
So these are just a handful of ideas 
that, if the body—and being in the mi-
nority, you know, sometimes we have 
to sort of persuade by hopefully having 
good ideas and just getting here on the 
floor and telling everyone about them. 
But there are ideas like this, whether 
it is the permanency of telemedicine, 
expanding the definition of such, pro-
viding individuals that ability to do 
testing at home, ideas like this or the 
previous one, and ideas of allowing 
small businesses to be able to get a tax 
credit for providing testing to their 
employees to keep them healthy. 
But I think this one is sort of how a 
reverse capital gains tax holiday actu-
ally works. It is creative, and we can 
put in some turning rules so someone 
doesn’t take an asset and sell it and 
then immediately buy it again. Those 
things actually already exist in the 
IRS Code. 
But these are ideas that I am hoping 
the body will step up, move forward, 
and say we can get this economy roar-
ing again, we can get back to the eco-
nomic miracle that 2018 and 2019 were, 
using creativity like this. 
And that is my pitch for this 
evening. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Chair 
for allowing me to tell our story, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

No. 195 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable CINDY 
HYDE-SMITH, a Senator from the State 
of Mississippi. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Mighty God, help our lawmakers to 
not put their complete trust in mere 
humans, who are as frail as each 
breath. Instead, give them the wisdom 
to totally trust You to guide them in 
doing what is best for our Nation and 
world. 
Lord, remind them that eventually 
all will be well for those who pursue 
Godliness and that You reward those 
who diligently seek You. 
May they remember that You will 
judge their work and reward their 
faithfulness, for they are accountable 
to You. 
Inspire them to continue to plant and 
water the seeds of peace, knowing that 
a bountiful harvest will surely come. 
Keep their motives pure, as they seek 
to glorify You. 
We pray in Your Merciful Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-

f 
LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
there is significant outstanding busi-
ness that Congress needs to complete 
before the end of the year. 
My Republican colleagues and I have 
stated over and over that we still want 
to pass more coronavirus relief for the 
American people. Senate Republicans 
have voted multiple times to send hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to schools, 
small businesses, healthcare, and laid- 
off workers. 
If Speaker PELOSI and Leader SCHU-
MER had not made the calculation to 
block it, that money could have been 
out the door many weeks ago. 
Instead, our Democratic colleagues 
have spent months—literally months— 
holding all of that urgent help hostage 
over 
unrelated, 
leftwing 
wish 
list 
items. 
Their so-called ‘‘Heroes’’ proposal is 
so unrealistic and poorly targeted that 
Speaker PELOSI’s own moderate Demo-
crats ridiculed the bill the instant she 
put it out and said it will never become 
law. 
It includes things like a massive tax 
cut for wealthy people in blue States 
and huge sums of money for State and 
city governments with no linkage to 
demonstrated COVID needs. 
Some blue States, including New 
York and California, have actually 
seen higher State income tax revenues 
this autumn than they saw during the 
same months last year, in part, be-
cause they are taxing a chunk out of 
vulnerable people’s unemployment ben-
efits. They are receiving more tax rev-
enue now than they did in 2019. Some 
of these blue States are receiving more 
revenue now than they did in 2019. 
But, 
alas, 
Democrats 
still 
want 
coronavirus relief for the entire coun-
try held hostage over a massive slush 
fund for their own use. 
Well, even if our Democratic col-
leagues continue to block any bipar-
tisan pandemic relief from becoming 
law, there are other responsibilities we 
still need to tackle together. 
The Federal Government is currently 
funded through December 11. The next 
few days will tell us a lot about wheth-
er Congress can pull off the bipartisan, 
bicameral appropriations process that I 
believe both sides would like to deliver. 
Last week, our colleagues on the 
Senate Appropriations Committee re-
leased all 12 bills for fiscal year 2021. 
The bills would fully fund all kinds of 
crucial priorities, from securing our 
border to caring for our veterans, to 
supporting public health at this par-
ticularly critical time. 
What needs to happen now is quite 
simple. Our colleagues on the com-
mittee and their counterparts in the 
House need to continue their bicameral 
discussions and settle on topline dollar 
amounts for each separate bill. 
I hope they will be able to reach this 
broad agreement by the end of this 
very week. That would help keep us on 
course to deliver full-year funding leg-
islation, which helps our Armed Forces 
and all Federal agencies plan and get 
ahead of the curve by the December 
deadline. 
For nearly 2 years now, we have 
avoided the drama that has become a

Washington routine and funded our 
government on a bipartisan basis. Last 
August, we passed a 2-year bipartisan 
funding agreement that let our com-
mittees do their work even amid this 
divided government. 
When both sides have honored the 
agreement and kept bills clean of poi-
son pills, Chairman SHELBY has been 
able to deliver full-year bills without 
drama. I hope we can replicate that 
successful pattern this year. 
Congress should also reach a bipar-
tisan, bicameral compromise on the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
and pass a conference report before the 
end of the year. 
Our men and women in uniform need 
every tool and resource to confront the 
great-power competitors, rogue states, 
and terrorists who wish us harm. Con-
gress should be an asset to our own 
servicemembers, not a liability. 
This year would make the 60th con-
secutive year Congress will have passed 
an NDAA. This is no time to break that 
streak and leave our forces in the 
lurch. Let’s get this done and pass a 
conference report through both Cham-
bers this year. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, while our commit-
tees are working, the full Senate is 
keeping busy with one of the core con-
stitutional responsibilities we have: 
continuing to confirm well-qualified 
men and women to lifetime appoint-
ments to the Federal judiciary. 
Yesterday, we voted to advance the 
nomination of Kristi Haskins Johnson, 
the current solicitor general of Mis-
sissippi, 
with 
multiple 
impressive 
clerkships under her belt, to serve as a 
district judge for the Southern District 
of Mississippi. She will make history as 
the first woman to join the bench in 
that district. 
This is just the first of several nomi-
nations we will consider this week. We 
will also vote on Benjamin Beaton, a 
Kentuckian who has been nominated to 
be a district judge for the Western Dis-
trict of Kentucky. This Paducah native 
is yet another outstanding choice by 
President Trump. 
Mr. Beaton received a first-rate edu-
cation from Kentucky’s Centre College 
and then Columbia Law School, where 
he edited the law review. He clerked on 
the DC Circuit and on the Supreme 
Court for the late Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. 
Since then, Mr. Beaton has excelled 
at some of the country’s top law firms. 
He has also undertaken a substantial 
pro bono caseload and shown a dedica-
tion to community service. 
At each step, the nominee has dem-
onstrated a firm commitment to the 
Constitution and the rule of law. The 
American Bar Association has con-
firmed 
what 
Kentuckians 
already 
knew—Mr. Beaton is well qualified to 
serve as a district judge. 
Last month, our colleagues on the 
Judiciary Committee advanced this 
brilliant nominee with no Members 
voting in opposition. I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in voting to confirm 
him later today and our other impres-
sive nominees this week. 
Now, this week’s nominees are only 
the latest example of the incredible 
qualifications that have characterized 
President Trump’s nominees. 
Take the metric that our Democratic 
colleagues have called the ‘‘gold stand-
ard,’’ the ratings of the left-leaning 
American Bar Association. As of a few 
months ago, across all the people that 
President Trump had nominated to the 
Federal District Courts, 68.8 percent 
had earned the ABA’s top rating—top 
rating—of ‘‘well qualified.’’ 
If you look back over the last seven 
Presidential 
administrations, 
only 
one—Bush 43—has managed to post a 
higher 
average 
rating 
for 
judicial 
nominations. Even then, it was only 
higher by just a hair—just a hair. 
Even the Democrats’ own supposed 
‘‘gold standard’’ destroys the talking 
point that President Trump’s nominees 
have been less thoroughly qualified. It 
is just not factual. It is not true. 
Earlier this year, looking at clerk-
ships and professional experience, one 
liberal commentator admitted that 
‘‘the average Trump appointee has a 
far more impressive resume than any 
past president’s nominees.’’ 
Let me say that again. This is a lib-
eral commentator who follows these 
things and admitted that ‘‘the average 
Trump appointee has a far more im-
pressive resume than any past presi-
dent’s nominees.’’ 
So it is pretty hard to argue that 
these haven’t been extraordinary addi-
tions to our Federal courts. This is a 
tremendous accomplishment. These are 
judges who will serve our Nation hon-
orably for generations to come. 
Our colleagues here in the Senate 
should be rightly proud to have con-
firmed them, and we are going to con-
tinue doing just that. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the mandatory quorum 
call with respect to the Beaton nomi-
nation be waived. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
MASKS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, before I begin, 
Madam President, I want to remind 
Senators to wear a mask as much as 
possible on the floor. I personally take 
my mask off when addressing the 
Chair, so long as other Senators or 
staff are not nearby. Otherwise, a mask 
should be worn at all times on the 
floor. 
This is not only for the safety of 
other Senators. This is for the safety of 
our staffs, everyone who works here on 
the floor, and everyone who works here 
in this building, as well as setting the 
right example for the American people. 
f 
NOMINATION OF JUDY SHELTON 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
Judy Shelton, today the Senate will 
vote 
on 
the 
nomination 
of 
Judy 
Shelton to serve as a member of the 
Board of Directors of the Federal Re-
serve. 
Ms. Shelton is, without a doubt, one 
of the most unqualified nominees I 
have ever seen for our Nation’s central 
bank. When her nomination first came 
before the Senate Banking Committee, 
a former Republican aide to a Senator 
on the Banking Committee said that 
she was so unqualified and so far out of 
the mainstream that the ‘‘idea of even 
calling Ms. Shelton as a witness for 
something was beyond the pale.’’ 
That is a former Republican aide say-
ing that Shelton wasn’t qualified to be 
a witness in a committee hearing, let 
alone a nominee to the Federal Reserve 
Board of Governors. 
It is not hard to understand why. For 
years, Ms. Shelton has advocated for 
the resurrection of the gold standard, a 
long since discarded policy that in part 
led to the Great Depression. She has 
questioned the independence of the Fed 
and, beyond that, has even questioned 
whether the Fed should exist. 
Ms. Shelton has also suggested that 
we put an end to Federal deposit insur-
ance, an institution that has protected 
American savings since the 1930s. That 
is why over 130 of the nation’s top 
economists, including seven Nobel lau-
reates, have opposed her nomination, 
as have countless alumni of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board of Governors. 
Ms. Shelton’s views have another 
strange quality: They seem to change 
when it is politically convenient. When 
President Obama was in office, Ms. 
Shelton harangued the Fed to increase 
interest rates, despite the economic 
downturn. But in 2017, when President 
Trump took office, Ms. Shelton abrupt-
ly switched her position and argued 
that the Fed should reduce rates, in 
her words, ‘‘as fast, as efficiently, as 
expeditiously as possible.’’ 
It may surprise few to learn that she 
was an adviser to President Trump’s 
2016 campaign. She has defended his 
candidacy and his policies and encour-
aged world banks to hold international 
conferences at Mar-a-Lago. Imagine—a 
nominee for the Federal Reserve, which 
is supposed to be an independent body.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7021 
November 17, 2020 
I have fought both Democrats and 
Republicans when they have tried to 
interfere with the independence of the 
Fed, but Ms. Shelton doesn’t seem to 
care about it at all. So that might be 
the most concerning thing about her 
nomination: her stunning lack of inde-
pendence. 
The Federal Reserve Board must 
make decisions based on objective eco-
nomic analysis and judgment, not 
whatever is best for one party or one 
occupant of the Oval Office. That is 
why terms on the Federal Reserve 
board last 14 years. We are supposed to 
trust Federal Reserve Governors to be 
neutral arbiters, no matter which 
party is in power in Washington. We 
are supposed to trust that everyone 
who serves on the Fed is first and fore-
most well qualified and truly inde-
pendent. 
But, unfortunately, Judy Shelton is 
neither. Ms. Shelton has shown herself 
to be an economic weathervane, point-
ing whichever direction she thinks the 
partisan winds are blowing. 
Every single Democrat will oppose 
her nomination today. I understand a 
few of our Republican colleagues will 
oppose her nomination as well. The 
question is, Will enough of our col-
leagues on the other side stand up and 
do the right thing today? 
Members of this Chamber have stood 
up before to prevent President Trump 
from putting unqualified partisan ad-
vocates on the Federal Reserve. During 
these final few weeks of the Trump 
Presidency, it is time to do it again. I 
plead with my Republican colleagues, 
for the sake of an economy that is 
hurting from COVID, for the sake of 
our future economy and its growth, to 
reject Ms. Shelton’s nomination. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
COVID, by all rights, the Senate should 
not be spending its time this week on 
so many nominees, especially such un-
qualified nominees, while COVID–19 is 
surging throughout the country. 
The urgent need for another relief 
bill has been confronting the Senate 
since March of this year. The Repub-
lican leader put the Senate on ‘‘pause,’’ 
as he said, all summer, while the virus 
got worse and worse. And when he fi-
nally decided it was time to do another 
bill, he crafted a partisan, emaciated 
proposal that fell drastically short of 
what was needed to address a bur-
geoning health and economic crisis. 
Now, President-Elect Biden has urged 
the Senate to pass a comprehensive bill 
that actually meets the needs of the 
American people. He pointed to the 
HEROES Act, and that is the right 
focus. We need a comprehensive bill 
that meets the needs of the American 
people, but, of course, we would want 
to sit down and negotiate with our Re-
publican colleagues. 
The Republican leader should come 
to the table and negotiate with Demo-
crats on a bipartisan COVID relief bill 
with a bipartisan process that address-
es all of the challenges we now face. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Kristi Haskins Johnson, of Mississippi, 
to be United States District Judge for 
the Southern District of Mississippi. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, for 
the second Monday now in a row, we 
have received tremendous news about 
the prospects for a COVID vaccine. 
Last week, Pfizer announced that the 
initial results of its COVID vaccine 
showed a greater than 90-percent rate 
of 
effectiveness. 
And 
yesterday, 
Moderna announced its COVID vaccine 
is showing a similarly high effective-
ness rate, raising the possibility that 
not one but two COVID vaccines may 
be available in the very near future. 
This success is a tribute to the inno-
vative power of the private sector and 
the efforts of Congress and the Trump 
administration to expedite develop-
ment of COVID vaccines. Operation 
Warp Speed has helped fund develop-
ment of Moderna’s vaccine and will 
help 
fund 
distribution 
of 
both 
Moderna’s and Pfizer’s products. 
While vaccine trials and development 
continue, so does research into new 
COVID 
treatments. 
Drugmaker 
Eli 
Lilly just received emergency use au-
thorization for an antibody drug that 
will be used to treat COVID in patients 
with mild or moderate illness. Another 
company, Regeneron, has also filed for 
emergency use authorization for a po-
tential antibody treatment. And there 
are a lot of other clinical trials going 
on right now for COVID vaccines and 
therapeutics, meaning there may be 
more good news to come. 
Meanwhile, we are also strengthening 
domestic production of personal pro-
tective equipment for medical per-
sonnel and other essential workers. 
And 3M, which manufactures N95 
masks, received two contracts under 
the Defense Production Act to expand 
N95 production. I recently visited the 
3M plant in Aberdeen, SD, to celebrate 
the opening of the plant’s new N95 
manufacturing lines. These new lines 
will help 3M’s N95 production increase 
from 22 million to more than 95 million 
respirators per month. That is critical 
progress on the PPE front, not to men-
tion the jobs that are being created. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Madam President, on the economic 
front, the good news continues. The Oc-
tober jobs report showed yet another 
reduction in the unemployment rate 
and revealed that the economy created 
more than 600,000 jobs in October. 
While we definitely have a ways to go 
to get back to where we need to be, the 
speed and strength of our recovery are 
encouraging. It is a testament to the 
strength of our economy before the 
virus hit. Thanks to Republican tax re-
lief and regulatory reform, our econ-
omy 
was 
thriving 
before 
the 
coronavirus descended, and that eco-
nomic strength provided the ground-
work for a strong recovery. 
Republican-led 
coronavirus 
initia-
tives like the Paycheck Protection 
Program have also helped keep the 
economy going during the virus. More 
than 5 million small businesses, includ-
ing more than 23,000 in South Dakota, 
have taken advantage of the Paycheck 
Protection Program’s forgivable loans 
to help keep their businesses operating 
and their employees on the payroll. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, of course, while 
there is much to be hopeful about, the 
virus is still very much with us, and 
cases are surging. My home State of 
South Dakota has been hit hard, as 
have many other areas of the country. 
While we wait for final approval of 
vaccines, it is essential that we keep 
following best practices and do what 
we can to slow the virus’s spread, like 
social 
distancing, 
wearing 
masks, 
washing hands frequently, avoiding 
large gatherings, and more. 
While the money Congress has al-
ready invested in COVID relief has 
gone a long way toward meeting the 
country’s needs, we should pass addi-
tional targeted relief to help Ameri-
cans weather the rest of the pandemic. 
Senate Republicans have introduced 
additional 
COVID 
relief 
legislation 
that would provide the hardest hit 
businesses with a second round of Pay-
check Protection Program loans, help 
schools and colleges operate safely, and 
provide additional healthcare resources 
to fight the virus. 
Our legislation would also provide for 
an additional $300 per week over and 
above regular unemployment benefits 
for those who have lost their jobs as a 
result of the pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7022 
November 17, 2020 
I am very pleased that our legislation 
includes an additional $20 billion in 
funding to allow the Department of Ag-
riculture to continue to assist ag pro-
ducers and processors. 
We have also made sure to include li-
ability protections for schools and 
businesses that are doing their best to 
protect others from the virus. Preda-
tory trial lawyers are already lining up 
to exploit the COVID crisis for finan-
cial gain. We need to protect our eco-
nomic 
recovery 
by 
ensuring 
that 
schools, businesses, and medical profes-
sionals aren’t subjected to frivolous 
lawsuits 
for 
coronavirus 
infections 
that were beyond their control. 
I would love to be able to say that 
Republicans will pass our coronavirus 
bill in the next couple of weeks, but, 
unfortunately, that depends on my 
Democratic 
colleagues. 
The 
Demo-
cratic leadership hasn’t shown much 
inclination to work with Republicans. 
In fact, it has shown the opposite. 
Speaker PELOSI spent more than 3 
months—3 months—supposedly negoti-
ating a coronavirus relief package that 
never arrived. Why? Because Demo-
crats refused to put a reasonable offer 
on the table. 
Members of the Speaker’s own party 
pleaded with her to arrive at an agree-
ment, but the Speaker wouldn’t listen, 
and she is still not listening. 
Despite the fact that her party lost a 
number of seats in the House in the 
election, the Speaker and the Demo-
cratic leader in the Senate are still re-
fusing to come to the table to work 
with Republicans. In fact, the Speaker 
and the leader have doubled down— 
doubled down—on their unreasonable 
demands. 
I get that Democratic leaders would 
like to able to design their own 
coronavirus bill with no input from 
anyone else, but that is not what hap-
pens in a divided government. 
In a divided government, both sides 
have to compromise in order to pass 
legislation. Republicans know that, 
and we are willing to compromise to 
get relief into the hands of the Amer-
ican people, but Democrats are not. 
Even as the coronavirus surges around 
the country, Democrats continue to in-
sist on their way or the highway. 
It is hard not to think that the 
Democratic leadership is more inter-
ested in exploiting this crisis for polit-
ical gain than in actually getting relief 
to Americans. 
We could have another COVID relief 
bill ready for passage tomorrow if 
Democrats would just come to the 
table. It is inexcusable that they 
haven’t. But Republicans aren’t giving 
up. We will continue to invite our 
Democratic colleagues to work with us 
to develop compromise legislation. 
I hope that at least some of my col-
leagues from the other side of the aisle 
will decide that a pandemic is not the 
time to play politics and will work 
with us to deliver a bill to the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

ORRIN G. HATCH UNITED STATES 
COURTHOUSE 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of S. 4902, which 
was introduced earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4902) to designate the United 
States courthouse located at 351 South West 
Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, as the 
‘‘Orrin G. Hatch United States Courthouse’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the Senate will proceed to 
the measure. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, this is 
legislation that would name the Fed-
eral courthouse in Salt Lake City, 
which was completed a few years ago, 
after my friend and former colleague 
and also a longtime mentor of mine, 
Senator Orrin G. Hatch. 
Senator Hatch, long before he be-
came a statesman, was a lawyer—and 
not just any lawyer, he was a lawyer’s 
lawyer. He was really good. He received 
the prestigious Martindale-Hubbell AV 
rating as a litigator. His skills as a liti-
gator were so good that they helped 
convince some of his friends and neigh-
bors that he ought to seek public of-
fice. The first public office he sought as 
an elected official was to the U.S. Sen-
ate. He was elected in 1976. 
He then served in the U.S. Senate 
from 1977 all the way up until 2019. 
During that 42-year time period, Sen-
ator Hatch had a profound impact not 
only on the U.S. Senate and his col-
leagues here—and he certainly did; he 
was a friend to everyone who knew 
him—but he also had a much broader 
impact, one that will have far-reach-
ing, lasting, durable impacts on the 
Federal court system. 
I took a look at a list of all Federal 
district judges—the trial court judges 
who have served on the Federal bench 
from Utah ever since our statehood. 
There are only about 20 people on that 
list. All but five of those came on to 
the court either during or right after; 
in other words, with some input—sig-
nificant input from Senator Hatch. 
Senator Hatch has also been a part of 
every judicial nomination in the con-
firmation process during that same 42- 
year period. I can’t think of any other 
Utahan in the history of our State who 
has had anywhere near the kind of im-
pact on the Federal judiciary as Sen-
ator Hatch. It is not just that he served 
on the committee throughout that 
time period that confirmed judicial 
nominees, whether to Federal district 
courts, to the courts of appeals, or to 
the Supreme Court—he certainly did 
have a lot of impact there—but his im-
pact even went further than that, you 
see, because he sought to be a mentor 
to people interested in the law and in 
public policy everywhere. His service 
had an impact certainly on me as one 
of countless lawyers and other people 
interested in law and public policy in 
this country. 
I remember watching proudly and 
with great admiration as he conducted 
himself as a member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee during the Robert 
Bork confirmation hearings. He had a 
certain commitment to the rule of law 
and to fundamental fairness that would 
be owed to anyone nominated to that 
or any other judicial position, and he 
was willing to make sure that the Sen-
ate did its job and that it didn’t get 
mired in the politics of the day. 
He had a great quote on this topic. 
He said: ‘‘Politics must not undermine 
the principles and standards we apply 
to every judicial nomination.’’ 
I watched over the years, in part, be-
cause I had first seen him participate 
in the Bork hearings. That got me in-
terested in the Senate. In part, because 
of that example, that got me interested 
as a teenager to apply to be a Senate 
page. I later became a Senate page, ap-
pointed by Senator Hatch. I got to see 
him carry out his activities as a mem-
ber of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. And from then on, I always 
watched with careful attention when 
he was handling a judicial confirma-
tion hearing. 
I watched through the years as he 
handled the nomination hearings of in-
dividuals including: Justice Thomas, 
Justice Ginsburg, and, later, Justice 
Alito, my former boss. In each in-
stance, he treated judicial nominees 
and literally hundreds of others like 
them with dignity and respect but also 
with the amount of thorough attention 
that lifetime appointment to the Fed-
eral judiciary demands. 
In addition to this, he also liked to 
try to foster in others a genuine inter-
est in the law. I remember, when I was 
serving as a law clerk to Federal Dis-
trict Judge Dee Benson in Salt Lake 
City—one of the brightest and most ca-
pable jurists ever to serve on the Fed-
eral bench, whether in Utah or any-
where else. He was a good friend, long-
time ally and confidant of Senator 
Hatch’s. I remember, while I was clerk-
ing for Judge Benson, right after I 
graduated from law school, Senator 
Hatch came by and just held a round-
table discussion with all the Federal 
judges. He not only seemed but was in 
fact conversant on all kinds of issues of

the law—not just the hot-button issues 
that people think of when they watch 
the news, but he was delving into ar-
cane details of the law that really 
made me proud to have him rep-
resenting me in the U.S. Senate from 
the State of Utah. 
I got to know Senator Hatch even 
better after I got elected to the Senate, 
and he and I had the opportunity to 
work together as colleagues. Through-
out all these experiences, I have come 
to revere him as someone who reveres 
the law. 
For these reasons, I conclude that it 
is fitting for us to name this Federal 
courthouse in Utah after him. It is dif-
ficult to imagine anyone who has had 
the same impact on the Federal judici-
ary who has ever lived in or served 
from our State as Senator Hatch. 
Madam President, I would like to 
yield some time to my colleague, the 
Senator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Senator LEE, thank 
you for your excellent remarks with re-
gard to Senator Orrin Hatch. I rise to 
second what you said and to add a few 
words, some duplicative. 
As you indicated, Senator Hatch 
dedicated his life to serving our coun-
try and our State, and he served in this 
body for some 42 years—a remarkable 
and extraordinary career of public 
service. And, of course, he was one of 
the longest serving chairmen of the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
and, 
therefore, played a pivotal role in con-
firming many, many current and now- 
retired Supreme Court Justices. And 
while serving as chairman, he also 
helped shepherd hundreds of district 
and appellate judges through confirma-
tion, including the majority of Utah’s 
Federal judges. 
His impact on the State of Utah is 
not just professional but also personal. 
Virtually anybody who stopped Sen-
ator Hatch and asked his opinion on a 
topic—he would stop, shake their hand, 
smile, and give them a full rapt atten-
tion. He is a tall drink of water, so you 
have to look up to Senator Hatch. 
I came to him, following the crisis of 
9/11, asking for his help in securing es-
sential security funding for the Olym-
pic Winter Games of 2002. Senator 
Hatch immediately took me to meet 
with other Senators, and he, along with 
others, was able to secure the funding 
necessary to make sure that our games 
were safe and were ultimately produced 
successfully in a way that made them 
the most successful Olympic Winter 
Games in history. He was and is an 
honorable public servant who con-
tinues to have tremendous impact on 
our State; therefore, it is only appro-
priate that Utah’s Federal courthouse 
be named in his honor, and I am glad to 
support this legislation. 
I yield my time back to Senator LEE. 
Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent 
that S. 4902 be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 4902) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed as follows: 
S. 4902 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. ORRIN G. HATCH UNITED STATES 
COURTHOUSE. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The United States court-
house located at 351 South West Temple in 
Salt Lake City, Utah, shall be known and 
designated as the ‘‘Orrin G. Hatch United 
States Courthouse’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the United 
States courthouse referred to in subsection 
(a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the 
‘‘Orrin G. Hatch United States Courthouse’’. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I am 
grateful my colleagues have chosen to 
allow this to pass into law. It is a great 
day for Senator Hatch, the State of 
Utah, and the United States. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION—Continued 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
United States surpassed 11 million 
COVID–19 cases this past week. This 
comes just 6 days after our Nation re-
corded 
10 
million 
cases—1 
million 
added to the 10 million in 6 days—mak-
ing it the fastest transmission of 1 mil-
lion new cases since the pandemic 
began. Nearly a quarter of a million 
Americans have died. This runaway 
crisis is alarming, it is deadly, and it 
demands action. 
The city of Chicago began a stay-at- 
home advisory to help encourage peo-
ple to contain the virus in our commu-
nities. Across Illinois, more than 5,000 
patients have been hospitalized with 
COVID–19 each night for the past week. 
We 
have 
shattered 
new 
infection 
records nearly every day this month. 
Illinois has now experienced more than 
597,000 cases, and we have sadly lost 
10,875. My heart goes out to everyone 
who has lost a loved one. 
In addition to trying to keep our-
selves and our loved ones healthy and 
safe from the virus, Americans have 
also been struggling to deal with eco-
nomic uncertainty, job loss, food inse-
curity, childcare—the list goes on and 
on and on. Here we are just days before 
Thanksgiving, and many of our neigh-
bors are trying to pick the right day to 
go to the food bank so they can feed 
their families on this day of thanks. 
Where is the sense of urgency on Cap-
itol Hill when it comes to providing an-
other round of economic impact pay-
ments, enhanced unemployment bene-
fits, funding for the food stamps—the 
SNAP program? Our country is in des-
perate need of help, and they are 
counting on us. 
You would think a crisis of this scale 
would be the first order of business for 
the Republican-controlled Senate this 
week. Yet, while this pandemic con-
tinues to rage, too many Republicans 
in Congress refuse to even come to the 
table to negotiate a comprehensive, bi-
partisan relief bill. There are those 
who will, and I commend them. It 
takes real courage. Instead, their lead-
er, Senator MCCONNELL, has scheduled 
votes this week on six barely qualified 
judicial nominees. The average age of 
this week’s judicial nominees is 38. 
You see, these are lifetime appoint-
ments. If you get somebody with the 
right answers to their political ques-
tions, then they will give you 20, 30, or 
more years while you have control of 
that court, and control of the court is 
more 
important, 
obviously, 
than 
coronavirus. 
The youngest one of these nominees 
is Kathryn Mizelle. She is 33 years old. 
The American Bar Association took a 
look at her record and judged her ‘‘not 
qualified.’’ This is the 10th Trump 
nominee for a lifetime appointment to 
the Federal court who has been judged 
‘‘not qualified’’ by the American Bar 
Association. You might say: I am sure 
that happens. Well, it didn’t happen at 
all in the 8 years of the Obama Presi-
dency. Not a single nominee who was 
judged ‘‘unqualified’’ was sent to Con-
gress. 
Another nominee, Stephen Vaden, 
who has been nominated for a lifetime 
position at the Court of International 
Trade, has never appeared before the 
Court of International Trade. He has 
never tried a case in any court. He will 
be a great judge once he figures it out. 
We voted on Dr. Judy Shelton’s nom-
ination to the Federal Reserve Board. 
She is uniquely unqualified. Her eco-
nomic views are almost humorous, 
they are so out of touch with reality. 
We are experiencing the worst reces-
sion in 75 years, and Dr. Shelton, by 
her stated views, is unprepared to con-
tribute to dealing with this economic 
crisis. 
It is the story of the 116th Congress. 
The 
Republican-controlled 
Senate 
spends month after month after month 
ignoring a raging pandemic and refus-
ing to even consider the House-passed 
relief legislation. 
Here is a good question for Members 
of the Senate: How many amendments 
has the Senate voted on this calendar 
year of 2020? Not counting impeach-
ment—set that aside. But how many 
amendments to legislation have we 
considered in this calendar year? The 
answer is 27—27 amendments in this 
calendar year. That is an improvement, 
incidentally. In 2019, we considered ex-
actly 22 amendments. Six of them were 
forced on us by Senator RAND PAUL of 
Kentucky, who basically said: I won’t 
let you go home until you vote on this 
amendment. And, as Senator PAUL has

said, of course he lost every one of 
those amendments. 
Twenty-seven amendments in 1 year; 
22 the previous year. Do you know 
why? We don’t legislate. We don’t de-
bate. We don’t offer amendments. We 
don’t pass bills. We come here with a 
new set of nominations every week 
from the Republican majority. We 
don’t have any legislation on the pan-
demic. We have no legislation on eco-
nomic recovery. We just have to get 
these lifetime appointees, some who 
have been found categorically unquali-
fied. That is what this Senate is all 
about. 
In this last week before the Thanks-
giving recess, is this really all we are 
going to do? How about the 28 rural 
hospitals in Kentucky that are facing 
the risk of closure? How about the $1.3 
billion of uncompensated losses for 
these hospitals across Kentucky? The 
Republican proposal a few weeks ago 
didn’t provide any economic relief for 
hospitals, clinics, or healthcare pro-
viders like those. 
Americans 
need 
leadership. 
They 
need for the Senate to step up and say: 
For goodness’ sake, whatever the polit-
ical agenda is here, how can it be more 
important than this pandemic? 
Isn’t there enough talent or will on 
the floor of the Senate—on the Repub-
lican side and on the Democratic side— 
to find a way to help Americans who 
are struggling, to provide unemploy-
ment assistance, to provide help to 
small businesses, these restaurants and 
small businesses that are facing clo-
sure, to give some money to local units 
of government that through no fault of 
their own lost revenue to this COVID– 
19 crisis? These are not wild ideas; 
these address the very basics that face 
families, businesses, and governments 
across this country. For some reason, 
that particular issue can’t make the 
agenda. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Mr. President, losing an election 
hurts. I know. I lost three elections be-
fore I ever won one. I suspect that any-
one who has ever lost an election has 
had to grapple with the disappoint-
ments, the what-ifs, and even a kind of 
sadness, bordering on anger, but that is 
the risk you take when you run for of-
fice. The voters have the last word. 
Never, until now, have we ever heard 
it suggested that a losing Presidential 
candidate ought to be allowed to put 
America’s national security at risk be-
cause he is struggling mightily to ac-
cept his own loss in the election. 
Never, until now, have we tolerated a 
losing Presidential candidate’s delib-
erately undermining Americans’ faith 
in the integrity of our electoral sys-
tem. 
Never before have we witnessed a los-
ing Presidential candidate refuse, out 
of spite and anger, to follow the law 
and allow the peaceful, orderly transfer 
of power to his successor. Never before 
now could many Americans even imag-
ine an outgoing President deliberately 
sabotaging our Nation’s heroic efforts 
to bring an end to the deadliest health 
crisis in our country, but that is what 
is happening. It is shocking. It is dan-
gerous. It is shameful. It needs to stop 
now. 
Some of my Republican colleagues 
ask: What harm can it do? We want to 
humor the President. He is going 
through a period of adjustment here. 
He lost an election. It hurts. The poor 
President—we have to stick with him. 
We have to parrot his theories of how 
there will be massive numbers of votes 
discovered somewhere. We know that 
he is raging in his tweets regularly. So 
he still must be in pain, the poor man, 
and we have to humor him. We have to 
tell him: Yes, Mr. President. You must 
be right. This election must have been 
stolen from you. 
Let me tell you what harm it can do. 
Every minute of every hour, an Amer-
ican dies from COVID–19. Every day, 
1,000 Americans are dying from COVID. 
That is nearly a 50-percent increase 
from a month ago. We are nearing 1 
million new COVID infections every 
week. The pandemic is surging in every 
single State, and public health experts 
warn the worst is yet to come. 
Over the weekend, we learned that 
President Trump has not attended a 
single meeting of the White House’s 
coronavirus task force in 5 months. He 
told us why. I am tired of this COVID– 
19, he says. He has gone AWOL. By re-
fusing to concede the results of the 
election, 
President 
Trump 
is 
pre-
venting our Federal health officials 
from 
meeting 
with 
President-Elect 
Biden’s COVID task force and starting 
to coordinate the efforts for the transi-
tion that is going to take place on Jan-
uary 20, and failing to put the time, 
personnel, and resources into the dis-
tribution of a vaccine, which we pray 
to God will be available soon. In doing 
this, the President is jeopardizing 
America’s ability to successfully dis-
tribute a COVID vaccine and bring this 
pandemic, once and for all, under con-
trol. 
He is deepening our Nation’s eco-
nomic crisis because the first step to 
healing our economy is in defeating 
this virus—all because of the pain he is 
going through personally. Well, I wish 
I could share that pain, but I am over-
whelmed by the pain of America’s 
going through a pandemic. The Presi-
dent’s hurt feelings don’t compare. The 
grief of losing an election is nothing 
compared to the grief of 246,000 Amer-
ican families who have lost loved ones 
to this pandemic. That is the grief we 
ought to be concerned about. 
More Americans voted in these elec-
tions than ever before—in history. Now 
that the election is over, the results 
are clear: President-Elect Biden and 
Vice President-Elect Harris received 
306 electoral votes versus 232 electoral 
votes for President Trump and Vice 
President PENCE. Four years ago, the 
President referred to exactly the same 
vote totals in his favor as a landslide. 
Today, 
he 
refuses 
to 
acknowledge 
them. He is so full of himself that he 
can’t feel the pain of others. Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS received at least 5 
million more votes than President 
Trump and Vice President PENCE. That 
is the largest popular vote margin of 
victory in a Presidential election since 
1932. 
In the 2 weeks since the election has 
ended, the Trump campaign and its al-
lies have decided to strike back and 
file a flurry of lawsuits in six different 
States, challenging the vote counts. 
Well, how are they doing? These law-
suits have only affirmed the integrity 
of the election results that we knew. 
Many of the complaints have been dis-
missed, and not a single vote has been 
invalidated. Even Trump campaign of-
ficials privately and publicly agree 
that none of the remaining legal chal-
lenges can change the outcome of the 
election. 
Last Thursday, members of the Elec-
tion Infrastructure Government Co-
ordinating Council, within this admin-
istration’s own Department of Home-
land Security, called the 2020 election 
‘‘the most secure in American his-
tory.’’ 
Over the weekend, a senior Federal 
election official who was nominated by 
President Trump condemned the Presi-
dent’s false postelection claims of vote 
fraud, calling them baffling, laughable, 
and insulting. The same official warned 
‘‘these conspiracy theories that are fly-
ing around have consequences.’’ 
They are dangerous to our national 
security. 
Over 
the 
weekend, 
John 
Bolton, 
who 
is 
President 
Trump’s 
former 
National 
Security 
Advisor, 
urged Republican leaders to finally ac-
knowledge Mr. Trump’s defeat and get 
on with it. 
Another former Trump security ad-
viser, LTG H.R. McMaster, rejected Mr. 
Trump’s claim on Twitter that the 
Presidential 
election 
was 
rigged. 
‘‘What the President says in this 
tweet—it’s just wrong,’’ the general 
said. ‘‘It’s regrettable, it’s counter-
productive.’’ 
John Kelly, once Chief of Staff to the 
same President, told POLITICO that a 
delayed transition was detrimental to 
the country’s national security. His 
concerns were echoed by more than 150 
former national security, senior mili-
tary, and elected officials who called 
on the leader of the General Services 
Administration, Ms. Emily Murphy, to 
recognize the election of President- 
Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect 
HARRIS. 
Yet Administrator Murphy refuses to 
gauge what is known as ‘‘ascertain-
ment’’ to establish who the real win-
ners were. She continues to deny Presi-
dent-Elect Biden and his team access 
to resources and the knowledge they 
need to begin the massive task of set-
ting up a new government. Adminis-
trator Murphy’s actions are in defiance 
of the Federal Presidential Transition 
Act, the law that has governed the 
transfer of Presidential power in Amer-
ica since 1963. 
Quite stunningly, what we are hear-
ing from our American President—the

leader of the free world—are the same 
kind of nonsense claims that petty dic-
tators use to deny citizens democracy 
and the peaceful transfers of power. 
One need only look at Belarus, at the

not a nation that cowers in fear. 
Leader MCCONNELL
has compared 
President Trump’s refusal to accept 
the election results to the delay in de-
termining the winner of the 2000 elec-
tion, which sounds right until you look 
at the facts. He is wrong. The compari-
son is wrong. The 2000 election between 
President Bush and former Vice Presi-
dent Gore ultimately came down to a 
difference of not 5 million votes but 537 
votes in one State—Florida—not tens 
of thousands of votes in many States. 
Even Republican attorney and elec-
tions expert Ben Ginsberg rejects the 
comparison. 
He 
ought 
to 
know. 
Ginsberg was part of the team that led 
President Bush’s recount effort in 2000. 
The refusal by President Trump and 
some around him to accept the election 
results is damaging faith in our elec-
tions and our democracy. The goal is 
clear: to undermine the legitimacy of 
the Biden-Harris administration even 
before it is sworn in. He is damaging 
the ability of President-Elect Biden 
and his team to get to work now on the 
deep and painful challenges we con-
front as a nation. 
People close to President Trump tell 
reporters off the record that the Presi-
dent knows he can’t win. Some say he 
just needs to very gradually come to 
accept the reality of his defeat. 
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Presi-
dent, your duty is to preserve this de-
mocracy. Your moral obligation is to 
prevent 
unnecessary 
suffering 
and 
death and to defend this country. 
For 4 years, Donald Trump has feast-
ed on chaos and the discord of America. 
Time and time again, he has placed his 
own self-interest over our national in-
terest. He has damaged the institutions 
of our democracy and abused his power. 
We shouldn’t be surprised by his de-
structive actions on his way out, but 
we shouldn’t tolerate them either. 
It is time for Donald Trump to accept 
the clear results of the election and for 
his administration to work with Presi-
dent-Elect Biden’s team for a success-
ful, peaceful, productive transition of 
power. It is time for the President’s 
friends, allies, and political pals to fi-
nally level with the President. It is 
time for a confrontation, perhaps—a 
moment of truth, perhaps—and to say 
to the President: It is over. Now be a 
man. Stand up, and show this Nation 
that we can have a peaceful transition 
of power. Show this Nation we are pre-
pared to accept the will of the Amer-
ican people. 
Subverting faith in democracy is not 
a winning strategy, and it should be be-
neath the dignity of any American 
President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was 
listening to our friend, the Democratic 
whip, and his advice to President 
Trump to capitulate before the re-
counts and before the litigation that 
has been filed has been finally decided. 
I know they would like to have him do 
so, but he is completely within his 
rights to use the existing procedures in 
the States and in the local jurisdic-
tions where these elections were con-
ducted to review the results to see if 
there are discrepancies. 
I also know they would like to say it 
is just about President Trump, but 
more candidates other than President 
Trump were on the ballot. We ought to 
be in the position of trying to preserve 
every legal vote for every candidate 
and making sure there are no mis-
takes, and there is a process in place to 
make that happen. 
I don’t know what the ultimate out-
come will be—I sort of have a sneaking 
suspicion about what the trend line 
looks like—but 72 million-plus people 
voted for President Trump and Vice 
President PENCE. Out of respect for 
them, at least, if not for the President 
and the Vice President themselves, we 
ought to let this process play itself 
out. There will be a peaceful transition 
of power. I have no doubt whatsoever. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, I would like to also 
take a second to respond to the Sen-
ator’s comments about our needing to 
do something about this pandemic— 
that we need to pass another piece of 
legislation and that we need to collabo-
rate with the incoming administration 
to make sure that we don’t miss dis-
tributing this vaccine on a timely 
basis. 
My friend from Illinois, at least on 
three occasions, has voted against bills 
that would help to facilitate the deliv-
ery of the vaccine and would ensure 
that small businesses and other indi-
viduals get the economic help they 
need during this crisis that has been 
through no fault of their own. 
By my count, our Democratic col-
leagues voted against a $1 trillion 
HEALS bill. They voted against two 
separate, more targeted pieces of legis-
lation that totaled a half a trillion dol-
lars each. Those are three occasions on 
which they voted against continuing to 
provide the aid that we had voted on, 
on a bipartisan basis, by the end of 
March—four bills worth $3.8 trillion. 
I could only have wished that the 
sort of bipartisan cooperation we saw 
up through and including the CARES 
Act in late March would have contin-
ued, but that wasn’t to be. Time and 
again, Speaker PELOSI stood on a $3 
trillion piece of legislation that she 
knew had no chance of passing. Why? 
Because it included things like tax cuts 
for millionaires and billionaires in blue 
States. She wanted to eliminate the 
cap on State and local tax deductions 
in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we 
passed a few years ago, and reward mil-
lionaires and billionaires, which was 
not exactly dealing with the virus, ei-
ther its economic fallout or the public 
health consequences. 
Then, if that weren’t enough—stiff- 
arming every effort that we tried to 
undertake since March to try to pass 
additional relief, both from a public 
health 
and 
economic 
perspective— 
today, the Speaker and the Democratic 
leader of the Senate took the bold 
step—the bold step—of writing a letter 
to Majority Leader MCCONNELL. Man, 
that was a bold step to protect the pub-
lic health and protect those who, 
through no fault of their own, find 
themselves out of a job or in financial 
distress. 
Well, I have been around here long 
enough to know the only reason you 
write a letter to somebody and then re-
lease it to the press before it gets to its 
intended recipient is for political pur-
poses. It is posturing. That is what we 
continue to see from our friends across 
the aisle—political posturing. 
Now they are saying—I think the 
Vice President himself said this—un-
less you drop the lawsuits, you drop 
the efforts to review the vote and to 
make sure all the ballots—all the legal 
ballots—are correctly counted and the 
ballots that are not appropriate are not 
counted, then people will die, unless 
you capitulate and give up all those 
rights. 
In the wake of these partisan efforts 
to defeat any meaningful, additional 
relief post-March, it should be held up 
to ridicule because that is exactly what 
it deserves. It is not serious. It is par-
tisan posturing. 
If the Speaker and the Democratic 
leader wanted to get to work on an-
other COVID–19 bill, do you know what 
they could do? They could pick up the 
telephone. You know, they could do a 
Zoom call. They wouldn’t even have to 
socially distance or wear masks. They 
wouldn’t have to worry about that. 
They could do it virtually. Or, if they 
wanted to do it in person, then they 
could come over, socially distance, and 
do it safely. 
But this is all partisan posturing. 
This is not about the public health of 
the American people. This is not about 
helping people who are desperately in 
need of additional financial assist-
ance—the small businesses and others 
that continue to struggle and lay off 
their workforce. 
If we are serious about solving this 
problem, then we need to work to-
gether as we did during four separate 
pieces of legislation, ending with the 
CARES Act in late March. 
But ever since that time, ever since 
we have offered additional assistance, 
Speaker PELOSI has shut it down. Our 
Democratic colleagues have all voted 
against it. 
If they were serious about it, they 
would have voted to get on the bill, 
offer amendments, try to make it bet-
ter, and let the Senate do its job. But, 
no, they wanted to make things worse 
in the runup to the election because

November 17, 2020 
one of their main arguments against 
President Trump was that he mis-
handled the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I know and you know that hindsight 
is 2020. We know that the public health 
guidance provided by the CDC has 
evolved over time. We have learned a 
lot since then. But they were more in-
terested in the blame game to advance 
their political cause in the runup to 
the November 3 election than they 
were in actually trying to help the 
very people who sent us here to rep-
resent them, and I think it is just 
shameful. 
TERRORISM 
On another matter, over the last 4 
years, our country has made serious 
progress in the decades-long fight 
against terrorism and to lay the foun-
dation for peace and stability in the 
Middle East. 
We have virtually wiped out the ISIS 
caliphate, which was the most recent 
manifestation of this poisonous ide-
ology embraced by al-Qaida that led to 
the attacks on 9/11. We have brought 
down high-ranking terrorists like al- 
Baghdadi, and we have eliminated the 
head of the Quds Force, the IRGC in 
Iran, that is the No. 1 state sponsor of 
terrorism in the world—Mr. Soleimani. 
We have actually strengthened our 
relationship with allies in the region, 
like Israel and Jordan, and taken a 
tougher approach on a unified basis 
against enemies like Iran. And the re-
cent Abraham Accords Peace Agree-
ment marked a historic step in normal-
izing relations between Israel and the 
United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. 
There is no question in my mind that 
the world is safer today than it was 4 
years ago because of the historic 
progress that we have made, not only 
against terrorists but to provide the 
foundation of peace and stability in the 
Middle East by encouraging Israel and 
its neighbors to work together where 
they can. 
But our job is not finished. Dan-
gerous and destabilizing forces still re-
main, and America’s military con-
tinues to play a vital role. 
I 
personally 
appreciated 
General 
Mattis’s doctrine of fighting terrorists 
by, with, and through our allies on the 
ground. That meant that we didn’t 
need to put hundreds of thousands of 
American soldiers and marines, Special 
Forces on the ground. We could work 
through and with our allies, and that 
was largely successful at eliminating 
the ISIS threat in the Middle East. 
So I was alarmed by Acting Sec-
retary of Defense Christopher Miller’s 
announcement today that without any 
real consultation either with our allies 
at NATO or elsewhere—certainly not 
with Congress—the Pentagon plans to 
withdraw troops from Afghanistan and 
Iraq to a potentially unstable and dan-
gerous level. 
I happen to be a member of the Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee, and one of 
the things our military does in for-
ward-deployed locations like the Mid-
dle East is provide enabling and force 
protection for our intelligence officers, 
who quietly work without any par-
ticular attention, hopefully. That is 
the nature of their work. But they need 
the military to be there to provide that 
force protection if they need it to en-
able their important work. 
So a precipitous retreat, which would 
reverse the progress we have made and 
fought so hard to make, I think, is 
deeply troubling. 
If we have learned one thing, it is 
about—maybe you call it the—I don’t 
know if you call it the physics of mili-
tary conflict or leadership, but history 
has taught us that power vacuums are 
not often filled by the good guys. It is 
the tyrants, it is the thugs, it is the 
dictators, it is the terrorists who fill 
those power vacuums, and if we mis-
takenly, even with the best of inten-
tions, create a power vacuum, we could 
see once again the rise of ISIS like we 
saw with President Obama’s premature 
withdrawal from Iraq. 
We simply need to learn from our ex-
perience and not make the same mis-
take again. A precipitous withdrawal 
would not empower our allies. Indeed, 
we have heard from some of those al-
lies. For example, NATO—the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization—has a 
significant number of troops in these 
areas that are providing training and 
support for our friends on the ground. 
It could well give rise to an oppor-
tunity for our adversaries—to the ter-
rorists and insurgents who would love 
nothing more than to see American 
troops packing their bags so they could 
claim that they have defeated the 
Great Satan, as some of them have re-
ferred to it. 
We would also, I think, cause our al-
lies to question our reliability, while 
unintentionally, perhaps, emboldening 
our enemies and jeopardizing the lives 
of civilians in the region. 
So I think we need to have a con-
versation here. We need to have a con-
sultation. We need to get the military 
leaders before the appropriate commit-
tees in the Senate so that we can ask 
questions and understand the process 
and what the end goal is, particularly 
this close to the close of this adminis-
tration’s current term of office. 
I understand the desire to bring our 
troops home. But in doing so, we can’t 
undermine the gains that they and 
thousands of other brave Americans 
have made in the fight against ter-
rorism and those who would do us 
harm. 
E-CIGARETTES 
Mr. President, on another matter, I 
have said here on the Senate floor 
many times over the last several 
months that COVID–19 is the most ur-
gent threat facing our country right 
now. But as I just got through saying, 
it is not the only one. 
Both here and abroad, the same 
threats and challenges that existed be-
fore COVID–19 are still with us and 
may have been exaggerated by the cur-
rent crisis. I spoke about one example 
here on the Senate floor yesterday— 
the strain on mental health resources. 
The stresses this virus are taking on 
our people—on the American people— 
are serious, as many cope with isola-
tion, health anxieties, job losses, and 
financial struggles. 
We are seeing a correlation with an-
other health crisis that has been exac-
erbated by COVID–19. Last fall, one of 
biggest health threats making head-
lines was the nationwide use of e-ciga-
rettes by our young people. Folks of all 
ages were experiencing a range of mys-
terious medical conditions linked to 
these devices, with vaping-related inju-
ries reported in all 50 States. What is 
most concerning to me is that most of 
those affected were otherwise healthy 
children and teens. 
I met one of those teenagers in Fort 
Worth last December when I visited the 
University 
of 
North 
Texas 
Health 
Science Center for a roundtable discus-
sion on the use of e-cigarettes. Sixteen- 
year-old Anna Carey was one of the 
many students at her high school who 
became addicted to e-cigarettes. She 
started to see symptoms that are un-
common for an otherwise healthy teen-
ager. She was extremely lethargic and 
would experience random and severe 
pains in her chest. 
Two initial x rays came back clear, 
so doctors released her, but she contin-
ued to struggle. Eventually, she was 
admitted to Cook Children’s Hospital 
and diagnosed with chemical-induced 
pneumonia in both of her lungs. 
Well, I am glad to report that Anna 
has now fully recovered and is using 
her story to encourage more teens not 
to go down the same path that she 
traveled down. 
Now, 
with 
the 
additional 
public 
health concern of COVID–19, the need 
for action to prevent children and 
teens from using these devices could 
not be higher. 
When it comes to the coronavirus, we 
know those who are older or who have 
underlying health conditions are most 
likely to experience severe cases. But 
there is a recent study by researchers 
at Stanford University School of Medi-
cine that looked at the connection be-
tween vaping and COVID–19 among 
young people. 
Researchers found that those who use 
e-cigarettes were five to seven more 
times likely to be diagnosed than 
nonusers. Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher 
is a professor of pediatrics and the sen-
ior author of the study. She said: 
‘‘Teens and young adults need to know 
that if you use e-cigarettes, you are 
likely at immediate risk of COVID–19 
because you are damaging your lungs.’’ 
Now, one of simplest and most effec-
tive ways to discourage children and 
teens from becoming addicted to these 
devices is to prevent them from even 
trying in the first place. But, unfortu-
nately, our current laws make that 
easier said than done. 
If you want to buy tobacco at a con-
venience store or gas station, you have 
to show an ID to prove you are over 18. 
So whether a teen is trying to buy e-

cigarettes or traditional cigarettes, the 
same guardrails are in place. 
But there are two different sets of 
rules when it comes to online pur-
chases. For traditional cigarettes, the 
buyer has to sign and show an ID at the 
time of delivery, just the same as they 
would have to do for in-person pur-
chases. But e-cigarettes are operating 
on a different playing field. Anyone, no 
matter how old or young, can go online 
and buy e-cigarettes and have them de-
livered to their front door, no ques-
tions asked—no age verification is re-
quired, no ID, no nothing. 
These devices, we know, are just as 
addictive and dangerous as traditional 
cigarettes and should be subject to the 
same restrictions. That is why the Sen-
ate passed legislation that Senator 
FEINSTEIN from California and I intro-
duced called the Preventing Online 
Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act. 
This legislation would put in place the 
same safeguards for e-cigarettes as tra-
ditional cigarettes purchased online. It 
is not to change the law; it is just to 
make sure we enforce the existing law. 
It would require online retailers to 
verify the age of the customer and re-
lease deliveries only to adults with an 
ID. Again, it simply applies the same 
safeguards already in place for online 
purchases of regular cigarettes and 
smokeless tobacco products to e-ciga-
rettes. 
These are commonsense, straight-
forward reforms, and that is why our 
legislation in the Senate passed unani-
mously this summer. 
It includes an amendment offered by 
our colleague from Kentucky, Senator 
PAUL, which requires the National In-
stitutes of Health to conduct a study 
on the short- and long-term health im-
pact of e-cigarettes on those under 21. 
When we talk about passing con-
sensus legislation, this is about as sim-
ple and straightforward as they come, 
and there could not be a more impor-
tant time to take action. If we are 
going to turn the tide on e-cigarettes 
and prevent more young people from 
facing the deadly health consequences, 
this is an important and necessary 
step. This bipartisan bill would keep e- 
cigarettes out of the hands of our chil-
dren, and I hope our House Democratic 
colleagues will pass this critical legis-
lation without additional delay. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it 
is timely that I should be giving my 
‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech with the 
distinguished Senator from Louisiana 
presiding because I am going to be 
talking about sea level rise, and seeing 
him in the chair reminds me of a re-
cent report on what sea level rise is 
doing to the great State of Louisiana, 
‘‘the sportsman’s paradise,’’ in which a 
scientist from Tulane University—a 
Tulane 
University 
geologist—was 
asked about the report about what the 
State had to look forward to from sea 
level rise, and he said: ‘‘What it says is 
we’re 
screwed.’’ 
NOLA, 
the 
news 
website in New Orleans, in Louisiana, 
ran that headline. So I know the Sen-
ator is sympathetic to it. 
But today, all eyes are on Georgia, 
which for the first time in generations 
voted for a Democratic Presidential 
candidate, and the two Senate races 
are headed for runoff elections, which 
will decide the balance of power in this 
body. 
Georgians of every race and back-
ground turned out to reject the politics 
of fear and division that came from the 
White House for the last 4 years and to 
reject the disdain for facts and science 
that has cost Americans so much in 
battles 
like 
COVID 
and 
climate 
change. 
Perhaps buried in the election out-
come in Georgia was Georgia’s know-
ing the threat of climate change. For 
people along Georgia’s coast, climate 
change is no Chinese hoax; it is a clear 
and present danger. 
In the spring of 2014, I took a climate 
trip along the coast of the Carolinas, 
Georgia, and Florida. I met with sci-
entists 
and 
students, 
outdoorsmen, 
faith leaders, and State and local offi-
cials, who cherish their coastal com-
munities, as Louisianans do and as 
Rhode Islanders do. They saw the seas 
rising and acidifying due to carbon pol-
lution. Georgians told me how deeply 
they care about their coast. That car-
ing has powered them through some 
tough 
battles. 
They 
fought 
hard 
against fossil fuel development off 
Georgia’s shores, and they won. 
It is not hard to understand why 
Georgians fight for their coasts against 
fossil fuel pollution. Near Savannah, I 
visited Fort Pulaski and Tybee Island. 
NOAA has a tide gauge at Fort Pu-
laski. It has been measuring sea level 
since 
1935. 
The 
tide 
gauge 
takes 
straightforward measurements—clear, 
irrefutable 
facts. 
That 
tide 
gauge 
showed sea levels up over 8 inches since 
it was installed. For low-lying areas, 
those 8 inches of sea level rise are a 
problem already, but it is going to get 
worse. 
Climate 
change 
worsens 
coastal 
flooding in two ways. First, it raises 
the level of the sea as glaciers and ice 
sheets melt into the sea and as warmer 
oceans expand. Second, climate change 
powers up stronger and more frequent 
hurricanes, which send those higher 
seas as higher storm surges farther in-
land. So it is important to look at how 
far and how often sea level rise and 
storm surges will flood coastal areas. 
This is the map of Georgia’s coastal 
area around Savannah. Here is Savan-
nah. Here is the coastline. Here is the 
ocean. Here is Tybee Island. This dot 
here is Fort Pulaski, where the tide 
gauge is. That is what it looks like 
now, but ‘‘now’’ is not going to stay be-
cause here is what Georgia has coming 
at it. 
Based on NOAA information, this is 
the risk of flooding along the Georgia 
coast. It takes NOAA’s intermediate 
prediction of sea level rise—‘‘inter-
mediate’’ meaning it is not the most 
extreme scenario; it is the midrange 
prediction—and it shows the risk in 
any year of a 4-foot-deep flood. 
So here we are in 2020, and the risk is 
negligible. It is about 3 percent, mean-
ing in present circumstances, you get a 
4-foot flood through that area every 33 
years. But by 2040, the risk is over 40 
percent, which means that a 4-foot 
flood in that area is now not happening 
every 33 years, it is happening vir-
tually every other year. By 2060, you 
hit 100 percent. You are getting a 4-foot 
flood in coastal Georgia every year. Of 
course this tops out at one flood per 
year based on the percentages, but if 
you look at this trajectory, clearly we 
are headed for multiple 4-foot floods 
per year in the outyears. 
When I was on Tybee Island, I met 
city 
councilman 
Paul 
Wolff, 
who 
showed me the city of Tybee’s new 
stormwater tide gate, which they just 
installed to protect the island from sea 
level rise. He explained that the road 
out to Tybee Island, which is here, run-
ning along that edge, flooded already 45 
times per year with just 1 foot of sea 
level rise. 
The city had already put in place a 
short-term plan for 14 to 20 inches of 
sea level rise by 2060. They were al-
ready thinking what the community 
would need to do as seas rise and act-
ing on the best science back at that 
time. But now consider this: Consider 
sea level rise and storm surges com-
bining to produce a 4-foot flood every 
year, at least once a year. 
Here is what that map looks like 
when you put 4 feet of water there. 
This is the Savannah area, and here is 
Tybee Island. This is all land in gray, 
and now all of this is underwater. 
Tybee Island has turned into just a 
tiny little atoll, basically, out in the 
ocean. The road that I was talking 
about is now not just occasionally 
washed over with water; for 5 miles, 
that road is underwater. 
Now, 4 feet of flooding happening 
every year is obviously bad, but re-
member, that wasn’t the worst-case 
scenario; that was the intermediate 
NOAA scenario. 
Here is an extreme case—10 feet of 
sea level rise. That was Tybee Island. 
There is nothing left. Do you want an 
island now? Your island is Savannah— 
Savannah Island, surrounded by water. 
Well before the physical disaster of 
sea level rise and storm surge and 
flooding 
happens, 
something 
else 
comes first: an economic disaster, be-
cause we are not the only people look-
ing at these projections of 4 feet and 10 
feet of flooding. So do insurance com-
panies. So do banks selling mortgages. 
In these populated areas that are now 
land, how do you insure against a 4- 
foot flood that will happen every year? 
You can’t buy a flood insurance policy 
for an event that happens every year. 
How do you get a 30-year mortgage for 
a property that will have flooded at 
least 30 times by the end of the mort-
gage? That economic punch—when you

can’t get insurance and when you can’t

come. 
Take Chatham County and Glynn 
County. According to a report by Cli-
mate Central, over $2 billion in prop-
erty value would be lost in those two 
counties with 3 feet of sea level rise. Up 
the flooding to 8 feet, and it is over $7 
billion in property value destroyed— 
people’s homes, people’s businesses. 
When a buyer can’t get insurance and 
when a buyer can’t get a mortgage, 
sellers face plummeting property val-
ues. The market unbalances rapidly be-
cause all of a sudden, you don’t have 
many eligible buyers. The only buyers 
you have are people who can afford the 
property without having to borrow and 
who can afford to take the hit of an an-
nual flood without insurance. That is 
not a big crowd. So the bottom falls 
out of the coastal property market. 
That collapse in the coastal property 
market is what financial experts call a 
systemic risk. ‘‘Systemic risk’’ is the 
mildest and blandest term for a catas-
trophe that I know. It means that the 
whole economy is threatened by the 
economic collapse of coastal property 
values. 
It is not just me saying it. In 2016, 
the top economists for U.S. mortgage 
giant Freddie Mac projected that cli-
mate-driven flooding along U.S. coasts 
will cause a property value collapse, 
leading to economy-wide losses ‘‘great-
er . . . than those experienced in the 
housing crisis and the Great Reces-
sion.’’ 
For those of us who remember 2008 
and the pain and the difficulty and the 
harm and the fear that was caused by 
that mortgage meltdown—greater than 
that, is what Freddie Mac says. That is 
not an environmental group, by the 
way; that is Freddie Mac. 
It has already begun. Lenders are al-
ready 
requiring 
bigger 
and 
bigger 
downpayments in coastal areas, some-
times as much as 40 percent of a 
home’s value before they will insure 
the remainder. Flood insurance pre-
miums continue to rise, and coverage 
limits leave many seaside property 
owners exposed to huge losses. 
The people who own this flooded 
property are going to want to know 
why Congress paid more attention to 
fossil fuel polluters than we paid to 
coastal property owners; why we would 
only listen to the people causing this 
problem and not listen to the innocent 
property owners who are going to suf-
fer billions and, if you multiply it out, 
trillions of dollars in losses. 
When I was in Georgia in 2014, a local 
clammer named Charlie Phillips took 
me out over the marshes on his air-
boat. It was a boat he built himself. He 
is a member of the South Atlantic 
Fishery Management Council, which 
runs the regional fishery, so Charlie 
knows his stuff. He has been an out-
doorsman his whole life, and he needs 
fresh, clean water for his Georgia 
clams. Charlie told me that changes in 
the climate are hurting the ecosystem 
that supports his and his employees’ 
livelihoods. Six years ago, Charlie was 
worried about a perilous future, one 
that looks even more perilous now and 
one to which we have not responded for 
6 long years. 
Well, one hopeful change is that we 
have a President-elect now—a Presi-
dent-elect who understands what is 
happening to our climate and who un-
derstands what is happening to our 
coastal communities. He is from Dela-
ware. He gets it. The question is, How 
will Congress respond? Will Repub-
licans allow a strong, comprehensive 
climate bill? So far, there is no sign of 
that, not in this building. 
At some point, we will—mark my 
words—we will finally cast off the grim 
and malign grip of the fossil fuel pol-
luters and their massive political influ-
ence machines. At some point, we will 
finally listen to the people now on dry 
land whose homes and businesses are 
going to be predictably flooded out be-
cause we did nothing. I will tell you 
that it had better be soon because time 
is not on our side. As these coasts 
flood—not just the Georgia coast but 
the New Jersey coast, the Rhode Island 
coast—as these coasts flood, coastal 
property owners will demand answers, 
and the Georgia voters who live near 
the Georgia coast are entitled to an ex-
planation of why nothing is being done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Okla-
homa. 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in my neighborhood and my commu-
nity, you can walk down the street and 
visit with some really great neigh-
bors—Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hin-
dus. They all live in the same neighbor-
hood and are friends. 
My kids are grown now. We watched 
all our kids playing together in the 
community and in the neighborhood. 
We can see just from this one commu-
nity and just from this one neighbor-
hood this beautiful thing our Founding 
Fathers dreamed of—the right of every 
individual to be able to choose a faith 
of their own decision, to be able to live 
that faith out, to be able to change 
that faith if they choose to, or to be 
able to have no faith at all. 
There are plenty of people in my 
neighborhood that I have no idea what 
faith they have. They don’t have to 
post it. They don’t have to print it. 
They don’t have to say it because they 
are an American. They don’t have to be 
a certain faith or be able to maintain 
that faith. 
The 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
makes known that every person has 
the right to life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. Our Constitution 
protects our right to a free press, to 
speak, to assemble, to petition the gov-
ernment, and to have any faith we 
choose and to be able to live that faith 
without fear that the government is 
going to impose a faith on them. 
Our founding government documents 
explicitly state these rights. We know 
that, inherently, these rights should be 
for all people. As such, I believe it is 
the responsibility of every American 
not just to cherish the freedoms that 
we have but to also be able to state 
those freedoms worldwide and to be 
able to encourage people worldwide to 
also live those basic human rights and 
dignities. 
The Trump administration is heavily 
focused on sharing these ideals with 
the world. In fact, right now, Poland is 
hosting the Third Ministerial to Ad-
vance Freedom of Religion or Belief Al-
liance. The United States has hosted 
the first two of those. In fact, I was a 
participant in the second one, and I 
was a participant online with the third 
one that was just in process. 
It was implemented with the help of 
Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador-at- 
large for International Religious Free-
dom Sam Brownback. It brought people 
of all faiths and of all countries to-
gether who choose to discuss religious 
liberty. 
This year’s ministerial definitely 
looks very different based on COVID 
worldwide and its restrictions, but it is 
remarkable to see Foreign Ministers 
from all over the world, many from 
countries that don’t practice religious 
liberty, in the middle of a conversation 
about religious liberty. 
Eighty percent of the world’s popu-
lation live where religious freedom is 
threatened or denied, which puts an 
extra obligation on those of us who live 
in freedom to be able to display that 
freedom 
to 
people 
worldwide. 
We 
should condemn religious persecution 
and work to ensure that all people have 
the freedom of faith, to live their faith, 
to change their faith, or to have no 
faith at all. 
In addition to the ministerial, I am 
really encouraged by the growing sup-
port of the International Freedom Alli-
ance, which has a membership now of 
32 countries. They are dedicated to ad-
vancing this basic right of religious 
freedoms. Not only are we seeing coun-
tries gathering in this ministerial to 
discuss religious liberty, many from 
countries that don’t allow religious lib-
erty, but we now have 32 countries that 
are dedicating together to say: We do 
practice religious liberty in our coun-
try, and we want to spread that. 
The alliance of these 32 countries, 
which we are a part of, has two core 
functions; the first of which is to en-
hance global advocacy to protect the 
right of freedom of religion or belief for 
all and to hold all accountable to those 
who violate that freedom of religion or 
belief; and the second thing is to serve 
as a platform to better coordinate the 
efforts of governments, parliamentar-
ians, and civil societies to advance this 
right. 
I hope this alliance continues to grow 
and continues to have gaining influ-
ence on the world’s stage. I hope they 
continue to condemn bad actors who 
facilitate or condone discrimination

and violence toward people of faith, 
while encouraging leaders to protect 
the rights of their religious commu-
nities and neighbors. 
The United States has a strong his-
tory and commitment to religious free-
dom, but some throughout the world do 
not have that privilege. One-third of 
the world’s countries have laws that 
prohibit expression deemed as blas-
phemous, heretical, apostate, or insult-
ing to religion. 
Depending on the country, punish-
ment for individuals who participate in 
this type of expression that they call 
blasphemy range from fines to impris-
onment, to even the death sentence in 
places like Pakistan. 
These laws affect Christians, Mus-
lims, Hindus, secularists, and all other 
groups. They scare people into hiding 
because of their faith. They punish peo-
ple for changing their faith, and they 
remove the most basic dignity of the 
individual: the right to believe. 
We should continue to expose those 
who take away that basic human free-
dom. That is who we are as Americans. 
That is what we stand for worldwide. 
The independent and nonpartisan 
U.S. Commission on International Reli-
gious Freedom has identified 84 coun-
tries that still have blasphemy laws on 
the books. That is why I joined Senator 
COONS in cosponsoring the bipartisan 
resolution to condemn blasphemy and 
apostasy laws around the world and 
called for the release of individuals 
who have been prosecuted or impris-
oned for charges of blasphemy. 
That proposal is ready to go and 
ready to be passed and has cleared ev-
eryone on the Republican side of the 
aisle and most everyone on the Demo-
cratic side of the aisle. 
To ensure that religious liberty is a 
core pillar of our engagement with 
other countries, the President issued 
an Executive order on Advancing Inter-
national Religious Freedom—the first 
of its kind. It is a recommitment of the 
United States to protecting the free-
dom to live out your faith, regardless 
of where you live. 
Under this order, the United States 
places an even greater prioritization on 
religious freedom with our foreign as-
sistance programs of the Department 
of State and with USAID. 
It is interesting, in addition to reli-
gious liberty, this administration has 
also partnered with other countries to 
protect and uphold the sanctity of 
human 
life, 
while 
prioritizing 
the 
rights and safety of women worldwide. 
Last 
month, 
the 
administration, 
along with the Governments of Brazil, 
Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, and Ugan-
da, led a coalition of more than 30 gov-
ernment leaders representing 1.6 billion 
people from every part of the planet to 
sign the Geneva Consensus Declara-
tion. The declaration reaffirms that 
‘‘all are created equal before the law’’ 
and that the ‘‘human rights of women 
are an inalienable, integral, and indi-
visible part of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.’’ 
This 
historic 
document 
also 
strengthens our international commit-
ment to the protection of the most 
basic human right, ‘‘the inherent ‘dig-
nity and worth of the human person,’ 
that ‘every human being has the right 
to life.’ ’’ It seems like that would be 
just a natural thing to say. It seems 
like that would be apparent, that we as 
a nation and that people around the 
world would recognize this most basic 
right of an individual to live. 
We believe in the right for people to 
be able to practice whatever faith they 
choose. We should at least agree before 
they choose whatever faith they are 
that they are allowed to live at all. 
This document that was signed by 
the Governments of the United States, 
Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, and 
Uganda has the simple statement, 
along with multiple others. It says: We 
‘‘[r]eaffirm the inherent ‘dignity and 
worth of the human person,’ that 
‘every human being has the inherent 
right to life,’ and the commitment ‘to 
enable women to go safely through 
pregnancy and childbirth and provide 
couples with the best chance of having 
a healthy infant.’ ’’ 
I am proud of this administration 
and the 1.6 billion people who are rep-
resented by the other governments 
that have joined into this simple dec-
laration 
to 
protect 
the 
rights 
of 
women, to stand up for the equal rights 
of those women, and to be able to stand 
up for the rights of every single child. 
The historic document strengthens our 
international 
commitment 
to 
this 
basic right. 
This is a critical tool for the United 
States and like-minded countries to 
preserve equal rights for all families, 
for all individuals in every society. It 
has four pillars: better health for 
women, preservation of human life, 
strengthening of the family as the 
foundational unit of society, and pro-
tecting every nation’s national sov-
ereignty in global politics. 
As I have said on this floor before, 
abortion takes a life; it doesn’t pre-
serve it. It is not a right, and we as a 
nation should not promote an action to 
the rest of the world that is antithet-
ical to the most basic of all human 
rights—the right to live, to make your 
own decisions. 
I 
am 
encouraged 
that 
we 
are 
partnering with other like-minded na-
tions, that there are people all over the 
world who are standing up for the 
rights of women to have equality, the 
rights to be able to protect human life, 
to strengthen families, and the rights 
to be able to protect national sov-
ereignty—something we should be able 
to stand up for. 
In the days ahead, I pray we continue 
to stand up for that because every indi-
vidual should have the right to live as 
they live, have the right to be able to 
have whatever faith they choose to 
have—to have that faith, live that 
faith, change that faith, or to have no 
faith at all. 
But they don’t even get to choose 
that if they are not even allowed to 
live first. That is something I would 
hope that we, as Americans, could also 
stand for. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today in solidarity 
with ethnic Armenians all over the 
world who have experienced terrible 
losses in recent weeks. This is a tragic 
moment for Armenians everywhere. 
Words cannot describe the devasta-
tion inflicted on the region by Azer-
baijani President Aliyev with the full 
support of President Erdogan of Tur-
key. Thousands of ethnic Armenian ci-
vilians and soldiers have lost their 
lives due to Azerbaijan’s aggression, 
with an unknown number more in-
jured. More than half of the population 
has been driven from their longtime 
homes. Every day, more are forced to 
leave. 
Every day, more are forced to leave. 
Azerbaijan’s aggression has created a 
massive humanitarian crisis that will 
require a significant response, espe-
cially in light of the worsening pan-
demic. The historically and religiously 
significant city of Shushi now sits in 
Azerbaijani hands, and the security of 
many sacred Christian sites falls to 
President 
Aliyev 
and 
his 
backer 
Erdogan. The world will be watching if 
these holy sites are desecrated. 
These are dark days, indeed, and it 
did not have to be this way. American 
leadership could have averted much of 
this tragedy. Unfortunately, after the 
conflict began in late September, the 
highest ranking Trump administration 
officials decided to remain largely ab-
sent and silent. 
Certainly, other world leaders en-
gaged. President Macron made calls 
and actively tried to reduce tensions, 
as one would expect from one of the 
leaders of the Organization for Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe Minsk 
Group cochair country. 
Unfortunately, others with less noble 
goals were also at the table. President 
Erdogan fueled Azerbaijan’s aggres-
sion, fanning the flames by providing 
devastating drone technology and Syr-
ian mercenaries. 
President Putin and Foreign Minister 
Lavrov worked the phones from the 
early days of the conflict. The result? 
Russia has a new foothold in the south-
ern Caucasus. Evidently, Russia was 
never fully committed to the Minsk 
goals and now has what they wanted 
since the 1990s. 
All of this happened while Donald 
Trump slept—yet another example of 
diplomatic malpractice at the highest 
levels of an administration which will, 
thankfully, conclude in January. Presi-
dent Trump’s departure is little solace 
for the ethnic Armenians who have 
been driven from their homes and seen 
their livelihoods go up in flames. 
So what is the region left with at the 
end of the day? The security of the Ar-
menian people, who have already suf-
fered brutal violence at the hands of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7032 
November 17, 2020 
Presidents Aliyev and Erdogan, now 
rests with peacekeepers sent by Vladi-
mir Putin—a flawed agreement that 
does nothing about the jihadis sent 
there by Turkey, who, if allowed to re-
main, could commit further atrocities 
against Christian Armenians. 
Without any commitments to the 
status of Artsakh, there is no incentive 
for Azerbaijan to make peace with Ar-
menia. Will we see another case of eth-
nic cleansing in the future? Do we sit 
silent? 
We now have a trio of authoritarians 
running the show in the southern 
Caucasus. It should alarm anyone dedi-
cated to a peaceful solution for this 
long-outstanding conflict. It should 
alarm anyone dedicated to democratic 
reform in the region. It should alarm 
anyone concerned about basic human 
rights and respect for international 
law. 
We in the United States should be 
concerned 
about 
national 
security 
issues that would affect us in the 
Caucasus. So, my colleagues, we are 
witnessing the return of great power 
politics in this critical region. Yet the 
world’s sole superpower is conspicu-
ously absent. This needs to change. 
First and most urgently, the United 
States must lead a response to the hu-
manitarian needs created by this vio-
lence, particularly for the tens of thou-
sands of ethnic Armenians forcibly dis-
placed from their homes by the 6-week 
war. 
Winter 
is 
fast 
approaching. 
The 
COVID–19 pandemic is raging. There is 
no time to waste. Congress and the 
Trump administration must act quick-
ly to save these families. The United 
States must make a substantial invest-
ment in humanitarian and develop-
ment assistance, along the lines of $100 
million, to make a difference for those 
on the ground. This includes funding 
for efforts to demine the affected area. 
In April, I sent a letter cosigned by 30 
other Senators calling for the Senate 
to appropriate $1.5 million in fiscal 
year 2021 funds for demining, robust 
funding for rehabilitation services in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and money for an 
independent assessment of remaining 
mine contamination to help inform fu-
ture efforts. 
Given the widespread use by Azer-
baijan of cluster munitions, rockets, 
and other such weapons in this con-
flict, I again urge this body to include 
those provisions in the final appropria-
tions bill. 
Second, the United States must im-
mediately—immediately—suspend the 
provision of defense articles to Turkey 
and Azerbaijan. We cannot and must 
not enable any future atrocities by ei-
ther of those authoritarian countries. 
Either we had a tremendous intel-
ligence failure or the State Depart-
ment lied when it issued the waiver to 
section 907 of the FREEDOM Support 
Act. Either way, we should be gravely 
concerned about reports that Azer-
baijan has utilized U.S.-origin defense 
equipment in this conflict. 
The administration must fully inves-
tigate these reports and respond appro-
priately to any violations of U.S. law. 
Indeed, Canada suspended arms sales to 
Turkey in response to the conflict for 
this very reason, and I applaud Prime 
Minister Trudeau for doing so. 
The United States must do the same 
and work diplomatically to encourage 
others to join us in common cause. 
To that end, I have introduced two 
resolutions that will require the State 
Department to report on human rights 
abuses by Azerbaijan and Turkey and 
on the role that U.S. security assist-
ance and arms transfers may be play-
ing in those abuses. I urge my col-
leagues to support those resolutions. 
Third, the administration must fol-
low the law. It should not waive sec-
tion 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act, 
which states that Azerbaijan should 
‘‘cease all blockades and other offen-
sive uses of force’’ against Armenia and 
Nagorno-Karabakh as a condition to 
receive U.S. assistance. 
The facts tell us that the Govern-
ment of Azerbaijan has done the exact 
opposite. America has no business re-
warding this kind of aggressive behav-
ior. 
I call on the administration to termi-
nate the waiver of section 907. Congress 
can also address this injustice in the 
fiscal year 2021 appropriations bill by 
stripping the existing waiver authority 
so that this security relationship stops. 
It needs to stop, once and for all. 
In addition, at my request, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office is cur-
rently reviewing the impact of U.S. se-
curity assistance to Azerbaijan, which 
has skyrocketed under the Trump ad-
ministration. The Pentagon alone has 
provided more than $120 million in 
equipment to the Aliyev regime in re-
cent years. This is simply unacceptable 
and must change. The GAO review will 
shed light on the impact of the re-
peated waivers of section 907 of the 
FREEDOM Support Act. 
Fourth and finally, Turkey’s aggres-
sion in this conflict must be addressed. 
President Erdogan clearly aspires to be 
a modern-day Ottoman Sultan, putting 
down stakes in Libya, in Syria, across 
the Eastern Mediterranean, and now in 
the southern Caucasus. 
Under Erdogan, Turkey has engaged 
in unbridled aggression outside of its 
borders, in violation of NATO’s found-
ing principles and international norms. 
Here is what we know: This Turkey is 
proving to be an unreliable ally in 
NATO. It is not a democracy, and it is 
not a responsible actor on the world 
stage. 
The aggression unfolding in Azer-
baijan should make crystal clear what 
we have long known: Erdogan is, with-
out a doubt, trying to claim the title of 
most destructive actor in the region 
today. Without a strong response, he 
will continue these advances and ag-
gression. 
I urge the incoming Biden adminis-
tration to stop him, and Congress has a 
role to play as well. We must finally 
sanction Turkey for its purchase of the 
S–400 from Russia, which is a clear vio-
lation of the CAATSA law. 
I expect that the fiscal year 2021 
NDAA will take this long overdue step 
and result in S–400 sanctions on Tur-
key. 
I would also urge the incoming Biden 
administration to reassert American 
leadership in the region. The United 
States must join with Europe in soli-
darity against Turkey’s violations of 
the sovereignty of Greece and Cyprus, 
which destabilize the Eastern Medi-
terranean region. 
Sanctions against those conducting 
illegal exploration activities on behalf 
of Turkey would be a strong show of 
support for our European allies, not to 
mention for the rule of law. Indeed, I 
have every confidence that President- 
Elect Biden and his team will live up to 
America’s responsibilities on the world 
stage by actually engaging on all of 
these issues. 
And though the OSCE Minsk Group 
process appears to be on life support, 
we can and must reinvigorate it with 
senior-level engagement. We must send 
a clear message to Ankara, Baku, and 
Moscow that violence as a means to 
solve the conflict will not succeed and 
pressure on Armenia from its eastern 
and western borders will not be toler-
ated. 
I would like to close with this. Above 
the 
road 
between 
Yerevan 
and 
Stepanakert lies the ancient mon-
astery of Dadivank. Father Hovhannes, 
a priest at the monastery, has vowed to 
stay even though the area has fallen 
under Azerbaijani control. His neigh-
bors have mostly fled, on their way to 
Yerevan, displaced by weeks of horrific 
fighting. 
The courage of Father Hovhannes is 
hard for most of us to understand, to 
even comprehend. It comes from a 
place of deep connection to the land, 
deep connection to one’s culture, and 
deep connection to one’s faith. The 
world will be watching as to what hap-
pens to Father Hovhannes and the an-
cient monastery of Dadivank. 
A neighbor of Father Hovhannes who 
also committed to stay in the area 
said: 
We are here to stay until the end. This is 
our God. It’s our church. Our cross bears a 
heavy weight. We are here to carry that 
weight. 
Throughout 
this 
war, 
Armenians 
across the region have carried that 
weight under relentless assault from 
Azerbaijan and Turkey. The Trump ad-
ministration let them down. 
The horror of recent weeks will be 
very difficult to undo, but we must 
start the work. Yes, we must start the 
work. By taking the steps I have de-
scribed here tonight, we can begin a 
new chapter of U.S. policy in the re-
gion and right past wrongs. And I am 
committed, as I have always been, 
alongside 
the 
Armenian-American 
community in New Jersey and across 
our country, to see this just work 
through to the end.

With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
NOMINATION OF TOBY CROUSE 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
this evening in support of the nomina-
tion of Toby Crouse to serve as a U.S. 
district judge for the District of Kan-
sas. I am joined on the floor this 
evening by the senior Senator from 
Kansas, Senator ROBERTS, and we take 
our responsibility seriously in vetting 
judicial nominees, particularly true 
when the seat that is under consider-
ation—when the seat that is vacant—is 
from our home State of Kansas. We 
need good, solid judges who interpret 
the Constitution in ways that enforce 
the law and provide justice and equity. 
I can tell my colleagues that Toby 
Crouse is highly qualified, both profes-
sionally and personally, to fill this 
seat. 
Toby has had a distinguished career 
since earning a law degree from the 
University of Kansas. He completed 
two Federal clerkships, including one 
that was with the Tenth Circuit. He 
then became a partner at Kansas’s 
largest law firm, Foulston Siefkin, be-
fore he was appointed as the State’s so-
licitor general in 2013, a position he 
currently holds while maintaining a 
solo law practice. 
Throughout his career, Toby has 
come to possess extensive trial and ap-
pellate experience in both State and 
Federal courts. As the solicitor gen-
eral, he has argued before the Supreme 
Court three times. 
I have had the opportunity to have 
numerous conversations with Toby, 
with his law professors, with his col-
leagues, and members of the bar in 
Kansas, and he comes highly rec-
ommended. The bar in Kansas, as well 
as the bench, is anxious for this posi-
tion to be filled so that justice will not 
be delayed. And the American Bar As-
sociation rates Toby as ‘‘well quali-
fied.’’ 
I want to thank Chairman GRAHAM 
and the Judiciary Committee for ap-
proving this nomination and Leader 
MCCONNELL for bringing this nomina-
tion to the floor for our consideration 
this evening. I am confident that Mr. 
Crouse will serve on the Federal bench 
with distinction, and I encourage my 
colleagues to vote for his final con-
firmation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
HEALTHCARE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the work of my good friend and col-
league, the junior Senator from Geor-
gia, Senator KELLY LOEFFLER. Repub-
licans, including the Senator from 
Georgia, continue to put forward solu-
tions to address one of our country’s 
most pressing problems, and that, of 
course, is healthcare. As a doctor, I 
recognize that healthcare remains a 
top priority for families all across this 
great country. 
Senator LOEFFLER also knows how 
important healthcare is to families, 
not just across her State of Georgia 
but to families all around America. She 
has a proposal. It is called Modernizing 
Americans’ Health Care. It is a plan, 
and this plan is another example of the 
important contribution that she is 
making here in the Senate to the well- 
being of the entire Nation. 
Her plan emphasizes that Americans 
with preexisting conditions must be 
protected. My colleague is absolutely 
right: Everyone knows someone with a 
preexisting condition. My own wife 
Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She 
has had three operations. She has had 
chemotherapy twice, and she has now 
survived that cancer by over 15 years. 
That is a preexisting condition. 
Let there be no doubt: Republicans 
will always make sure that patients 
are able to get insurance regardless of 
their medical condition. 
Senator LOEFFLER’s plan also recog-
nizes the need for more insurance 
choices. Americans need the coverage 
that works for them and their families. 
It should be available, affordable, and 
appropriate for them—what they need, 
not what the government says they 
have to have. Families need more op-
tions. 
Association health plans let small 
businesses and community organiza-
tions come together with the buying 
power of large corporations. This helps 
lower the cost of care. Main Street, I 
believe, deserves the same opportunity 
to buy insurance as Wall Street, and 
that is what Senator LOEFFLER is pro-
posing. 
Her plan also lets consumers save 
more of their own money to pay for 
healthcare. Right now, as a result of 
the Obama healthcare law, Americans 
can only use a health savings account 
when it is tied to a high deductible 
healthcare plan. My colleague from 
Georgia wants to expand these ac-
counts for anyone with health insur-
ance coverage regardless of their type 
of insurance plan. 
Everyone knows over the last year— 
since the Obama healthcare law was 
passed—that deductibles have contin-
ued to keep climbing. We need to give 
families relief by letting them save 
more of their own money tax-free 
through a health savings account. That 
way, families could use their money to 
pay for deductibles and other kinds of 
healthcare expenses that right now 
they are not allowed to do. 
As a doctor, one thing in particular 
that I strongly support, of course, is di-
rect primary care. We have it running 
successfully in my home State of Wyo-
ming. That is when someone pays your 
healthcare provider a flat monthly fee 
instead of a fee every time you visit 
the doctor or the nurse or the nurse 
practitioner. 
Consumers like this arrangement. 
They like it because it takes the uncer-
tainty out of a doctor’s visit. They al-
ways know what they are going to pay 
month to month to month. Providers 
like it because they get to focus on pa-
tients over all of the paperwork that is 
so often required by insurance compa-
nies. 
I talk to doctors who are tired of 
practicing medicine and want to retire: 
What is it you don’t like? They love 
taking care of patients, but they hate 
the paperwork that comes with it, so 
often related to the law, the mandates, 
and the things that happen with trying 
to comply with the insurance paper-
work. 
A lot more can be done, and we know 
this as a result of coronavirus in terms 
of providing healthcare using telemedi-
cine. Especially, Madam President, in 
your home State and mine, where there 
are great distances and lots of rural 
communities, it is a great opportunity 
for people to receive healthcare from a 
distance, using the newest technology 
of the day. 
I think we have seen much more 
about telemedicine due to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Patients have tried it. 
They like it. The providers I have 
talked to around the State of Wyoming 
like it a lot. 
There have been issues in the past, 
though—the issues of how to reimburse 
and how many visits and the distance. 
And did they need to come into the of-
fice? Would it be covered by insurance? 
Would it be covered by Medicare? 
Would it be covered by Medicaid? All of 
these are issues—hassles—for the pa-
tient and the provider, but, to me, tele-
medicine is now here to stay. 
These direct primary care practices 
truly have been on the leading edge of 
telemedicine because they didn’t have 
to worry about insurance company re-
imbursements based on the number of 
face-to-face visits. They could just 
visit and talk to the patient using tele-
medicine. 
Speaking of COVID–19, this plan also 
ensures that we continue fighting back 
against this virus. There is tremendous 
news today about the vaccines—two 
vaccines, one that is 90 percent effec-
tive and one that is 94 percent effec-
tive. 
As a doctor, I will tell you, these are 
breakthroughs. These are modern-day 
miracles of medicine. If you think 
about it, not that long ago Dr. Fauci 
said that if we could get a vaccine that 
was 50 percent effective, that would be 
tremendous. But we are talking much, 
much higher rates of effectiveness than 
that. 
My colleague in her proposal also 
calls for focus on something we can all 
support, and that is making drugs and 
personal protective equipment here in 
the United States—producing here at 
home in America. We need to bring the 
manufacturing of these critical sup-
plies back to our own communities, 
certainly back to our country. Never 
again—never 
again—should 
our 
pa-
tients and healthcare workers be held 
hostage by China or any other nation. 
Senator LOEFFLER knows that Amer-
icans should not be the sole payers for 
the innovation that supports the rest

of the world. My colleague’s plan rein-
forces the fact that our trade policies 
must reflect when countries freeload 
off of American innovation. 
Finally, she wants to make sure that 
pharmacy discounts benefit the pa-
tients, not large pharmacies’ so-called 
benefit managers. This is a common-
sense legislative proposal that will 
mean lower drug prices for patients 
who have to take expensive medica-
tions. When discounts go directly to 
patients, Americans will see much 
lower costs when they pay at the phar-
macy counter. 
This is by no means an exhaustive 
list of what is in Senator LOEFFLER’s 
proposal. But I am sure that in the 
days ahead, the Senate will have a 
chance to hear more about her impor-
tant work on healthcare. I look for-
ward to continuing to work with her 
and all of my colleagues as Republicans 
get these important policies enacted 
into law.

RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL 
OF TOURMALINE IN MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this 
year, in addition to celebrating the bi-
centennial of the State of Maine, we 
are also commemorating the bicenten-
nial of the first major find in North 
America of the treasured semiprecious 
stone tourmaline in the mountains of 
western Maine. It is a fascinating his-
torical coincidence that the State of 
Maine and the discovery of its official 
State gemstone share the same anni-
versary. 
Maine became our Nation’s 23rd 
State on March 15, 1820. In late autumn 
of that year, college students Elijah 
Hamlin and Ezekiel Holmes were pur-
suing their studies in mineralogy on an 
expedition to Mount Mica in Paris, ME. 
As they headed down the mountain at 
sunset, they spotted a vivid green spar-
kle amid the tangled roots of a fallen 
tree. The beautiful crystal was an ex-
citing find, but the encroaching dark-
ness prevented further exploration. 
Their plan to continue their search 
the next morning was cancelled by an 
overnight snowfall that blanketed the 
ground until spring. When the two stu-
dents did return months later, they 
were astonished by the amount and va-
riety of the crystals among the rocky 
ledges. The many shades of green, red, 
white, and yellow translucent stones 
they found explain why the word 
‘‘tourmaline,’’ which comes from an 
ancient language of Sri Lanka, roughly 
translates to ‘‘many colors.’’ 
News of the discovery spread, and the 
region soon became the foremost hunt-
ing grounds in North America for these 
remarkable gems, rivaling famous sites 
in South America and Asia. Among the 
early Maine rock hounds was Elijah 
Hamlin’s younger brother Hannibal, 
who four decades later would serve as 
President Lincoln’s first Vice Presi-
dent. 
Today, Maine tourmaline is treas-
ured by jewelers, artists, and collec-
tors. Our distinctive watermelon tour-
maline, which combines pink, white, 
and green in one stone, is especially 
prized. Residents and visitors alike de-
light in searching for these gorgeous 
stones amid the marvelous scenery of 
our western mountains. 
The Hamlin Necklace, containing 
stones of various colors from the origi-
nal find, can be seen at the Harvard

University Mineralogical Museum. In 
1972, a spectacular discovery in Newry, 
ME, yielded hundreds of pounds of red 
and 
green 
crystals, 
including 
the 
‘‘Jolly Green Giant,’’ a 10–inch crystal 
now in the Smithsonian’s National Mu-
seum of Natural History collection. 
The State of Maine tourmaline neck-
lace was designed using Newry gems 
and presented to the State in 1975 by 
the Maine Retail Jewelers Association. 
On Presidents Day 2010, a major dis-
covery included a 120–carat blue tour-
maline crystal, among the most rare of 
hues. This was named ‘‘The President’’ 
and was cut into nine gems. The larg-
est was presented as a gift from the 
State of Maine to President Barack 
Obama when he visited that year. 
How and why such large deposits of 
tourmaline are found in Maine, so dis-
tant from the usual locales, remains a 
puzzle for geologists to solve. It is 
worth noting, however, that tour-
maline is said to bestow on its bearer 
fearlessness, happiness, and self-con-
fidence—qualities that define the peo-
ple of our State. 
Mr. President, Maine is renowned for 
the stunning beauty of its mountains, 
forests, and seacoast. The 200th anni-
versary of the discovery of tourmaline 
is a reminder that some of the most 
beautiful things are not as readily ap-
parent but are well worth looking for.

REMEMBERING SCOTT IRVING 
PEEK, SR. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today, 
I honor the life and legacy of Scott Ir-
ving Peek, Sr., who passed away on No-
vember 10, 2020 at the age of 94. Known 
to many as Scotty, he was raised in 
Jacksonville, FL, with a strong work 
ethic that carried him through a sto-
ried life and career. After high school, 
Scotty served in the U.S. Merchant 
Marines during World War II. He then 
went to the University of Florida on a 
track scholarship in 1945; however, his 
service to our Nation took precedence, 
and he served in the U.S. Army from 
1946 through 1948. He then returned to 
UF, where he played both football and 
track and in 1952 earned his degree in 
physical education, health, and recre-
ation. 
After college, Scotty heard the call-
ing for public service and began a ca-
reer on Capitol Hill, serving as an aide 
to 
Florida’s 
U.S. 
Senator 
George 
Smathers. His advice and counsel was 
lauded, and he quickly became an inte-
gral member of Senator Smathers’ 
team and family. He served his State 
and Nation with honor. It was in Wash-
ington, DC that he met his wife, Lillian 
Barretto, and perhaps his greatest ac-
complishment, together they raised six 
children: Nancy, Rosemary, Scott Jr., 
Catherine, William, and George. 
After returning to Florida, Scotty 
started a public relations firm and en-
joyed a successful career in many ven-
tures, including real estate. If you 
knew Scotty, you knew he was pas-
sionate about his family and the Uni-
versity of Florida. He served in mul-
tiple capacities for the UF Foundation, 
and that incredible work was honored 
by three UF Presidents. 
Through his devotion to his wife of 65 
years, children, grandchildren, great 
grandchildren, 
family 
and 
friends, 
there is no doubt that Scotty left a 
mark on this world. I honor his life and 
continued legacy.∑

TRIBUTE TO JERRY ELMER 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to honor Mr. Elmer, 
one of Rhode Island’s leading advocates 
for humanitarian and environmental 
causes. Mr. Elmer is set to retire after 
a long and successful career, most re-
cently with the Conservation Law 
Foundation. 
After graduating from Rhode Island 
College and Harvard Law School, Mr. 
Elmer devoted the first part of his ca-
reer to humanitarian, peace, and secu-
rity issues. He was codirector of Rhode 
Island’s 
American 
Friends 
Service 
Committee, where he focused on nu-
clear disarmament and human rights. 
He also traveled extensively in South 
and Southeast Asia to research the sta-
tus of human rights and the effect of 
Western military and economic aid 
programs in the region. 
Mr. Elmer’s work yielded important, 
lasting change. He authored a key ref-
erendum to freeze the production and 
deployment of nuclear weapons, which 
appeared as a ballot question in Rhode 
Island in 1982. He then led the success-
ful statewide campaign for that ref-
erendum. The 1982 nuclear freeze meas-
ure was, at that time, the largest na-
tionally coordinated voter referendum 
in U.S. history. 
Later in his career, Mr. Elmer turned 
to the fight for climate action for re-
newable power in Rhode Island’s en-
ergy market. At the Conservation Law 
Foundation, Mr. Elmer appeared before 
Federal and State courts and the Pub-
lic Utilities Commission to enforce 
Rhode Island’s renewable energy laws. 
He was the principal author of several 
of Rhode Island’s major renewable en-
ergy statutes. Notably, he drafted the 
long-term contracting statue, which 
gave rise to the Nation’s first offshore 
wind project, the Block Island Wind 
Farm, and helped to write the distrib-
uted generation standard contracts 
law, to create a comprehensive frame-
work to spur development of small, 
local renewable energy projects across 
the State. In recent years, Mr. Elmer 
led successful opposition to the siting 
of 
a 
fossil 
fuel 
power 
plant 
in 
Burrillville, RI, and has been one of 
Rhode Island’s great environmental 
litigators. 
Mr. Elmer is a staunch advocate for 
human rights, peace, and action on cli-
mate. His tireless efforts on behalf of 
the Conservation Law Foundation and 
Rhode Island echo far beyond our 
State. I am proud to recognize his serv-
ice and thank him for such an impres-
sive career in battle for great causes.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–249. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana Congressional Delegation to take 
such actions as are necessary to require the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
grant Louisiana full federal funding for dis-
aster expenses associated with Hurricane 
Laura or to grant Louisiana the ability to 
utilize alternative sources of federal funding 
as needed, matching funds if full federal 
funding is not provided; to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. 
HOSUE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura was one of the 
most powerful storms to hit Louisiana in re-
corded history; and 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura’s exceptionally 
strong winds left a scar of damage across our 
state spanning from the Gulf Coast to our 
northern border; and 
Whereas, while loss and damage totals are 
still being compiled, the projections across 
all states impacted by Hurricane Laura are 
expected to be in the tens of billions of dol-
lars and Louisiana was undoubtedly the 
state that suffered the brunt of the storm’s 
impact; and 
Whereas, between the worldwide slump in 
oil prices and the COVID–19 pandemic shut-
tering businesses across the state and with-
ering the state’s previously strong tourism 
revenues, Louisiana’s economic prospects for 
the current and ensuing fiscal years were al-
ready 
strained 
before 
Hurricane 
Laura 
wreaked her havoc; and 
Whereas, before Hurricane Laura arrived, 
Louisiana was already expecting a budget 
shortfall for the next fiscal year totaling 
hundreds of millions of dollars; and 
Whereas, the strain of providing for the 
health and safety of its citizens while also 
meeting the matching fund requirements for 
the Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy’s assistance in recovering and rebuilding 
from Hurricane Laura could cripple our state 
fiscal resources and infrastructure in the 
next few years; and 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, as of early 2013, over the 
prior twenty-four years, cost-share adjust-
ments had been made for major disaster dec-
larations two hundred and forty-four times, 
including for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike, 
Gustav, and Sandy; and 
Whereas, Louisiana’s request to have the 
state matching portion of its federal disaster 
assistance waived is not unprecedented and 
would provide much-needed relief to a state 
struggling with this year’s unexpected hard-
ships. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress and the Louisiana Congressional 
Delegation to take such actions as are nec-
essary to require the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to grant Louisiana full 
federal funding for disaster expenses associ-
ated with Hurricane Laura or to grant Lou-
isiana the ability to utilize alternative 
sources of federal funding as needed match-
ing funds if full federal funding is not pro-
vided; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and House of Representatives of the 
Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana Con-
gressional Delegation.

HOUSE, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Ms. SMITH, and 
Mr. MENENDEZ) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 775 
Whereas September 30, 2020, marks the 70th 
anniversary of the date on which President 
Harry S Truman signed the Act of Sep-
tember 30, 1950 (commonly known as the 
‘‘Impact Aid Act’’) (64 Stat. 1100; chapter 
1124), which established the Impact Aid pro-
gram; 
Whereas the community served by the Im-
pact Aid program considers the Impact Aid 
program to be the ‘‘original’’ Federal ele-
mentary and secondary education program; 
Whereas the Impact Aid program is admin-
istered by the Secretary of Education; 
Whereas the Impact Aid program reim-
burses local educational agencies for the loss 
of revenue and other costs associated with 
the presence of tax-exempt Federal property 
within the boundaries of those local edu-
cational agencies; 
Whereas payments under the Impact Aid 
program are dispersed directly to local edu-
cational agencies, which allocate those pay-
ments based on local context and needs to 
provide a quality education to the students 
served by those local educational agencies; 
Whereas, in 2020, nearly 880,000 children, 
including children of individuals in the uni-
formed services (as defined in section 101 of 
title 37, United States Code), children resid-
ing on Indian lands, children in low-rent pub-
lic housing, and children of civilians working 
or living on Federal land, are ‘‘federally con-
nected children’’ who are served by local 
educational agencies that are eligible for 
basic support payments under the Impact 
Aid program; 
Whereas there are 4,800,000 acres of feder-
ally owned land within the boundaries of 
local educational agencies for which those 
local educational agencies are eligible to re-
ceive Federal property payments under the 
Impact Aid program; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, $1,486,112,000 
will be provided under the Impact Aid pro-
gram to more than 1,100 local educational 
agencies that together enroll more than 
10,000,000 students; 
Whereas, in 1965, Congress passed the Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), which amended 
the Act of September 30, 1950 (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Impact Aid Act’’) (64 Stat. 
1100; chapter 1124); 
Whereas, in 1994, Congress passed the Im-
proving America’s Schools Act of 1994 (Pub-
lic Law 103–382; 108 Stat. 3518), which re-
pealed the Act of September 30, 1950 (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Impact Aid Act’’) (64 
Stat. 1100; chapter 1124), and codified the Im-
pact Aid program in the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
6301 et seq.); 
Whereas Congress has continued to dem-
onstrate support for the Impact Aid program 
by reauthorizing that program 16 times be-
tween 1950 and 2020; 
Whereas, to formalize and energize the 
broad, bipartisan support for the Impact Aid 
program, the Senate Impact Aid Coalition 
was established in 1996 and the House Impact 
Aid Coalition was established in 1995; and 
Whereas the Federal obligation on which 
the Impact Aid program is based is the same 
in September 2020 as it was when the Impact 
Aid program was established 70 years before, 
in September 1950: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 30, 2020, as ‘‘Im-
pact Aid Recognition Day’’ to recognize the 
70th anniversary of the establishment of the 
Impact Aid program; and 
(2) recognizes the importance of— 
(A) the Impact Aid program under title VII 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7701 et seq.); and 
(B) the objective of that program to ensure 
that all children educated in federally im-
pacted school districts receive a high-quality 
education and have access to the opportuni-
ties needed to reach their full potential.

SENATE RESOLUTION 776—DESIG-
NATING THE WEEK BEGINNING 
SEPTEMBER 
13, 
2020, 
AS 
‘‘NA-
TIONAL DIRECT SUPPORT PRO-
FESSIONALS 
RECOGNITION 
WEEK’’ 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mr. KING, Mr. BROWN, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. MENENDEZ, Ms. 
WARREN, 
Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Ms. HASSAN, Mr. JONES, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. CASEY, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. ROSEN, Mr. 
KAINE, and Ms. SMITH) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 776 
Whereas direct support professionals, in-
cluding direct care workers, personal assist-
ants, personal attendants, in-home support 
workers, and paraprofessionals, are key to 
providing publicly funded, long-term support 
and services for millions of individuals with 
disabilities; 
Whereas, during the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID– 
19’’) pandemic, many direct support profes-
sionals continue to arrive for work every day 
in order to ensure the health and safety of 
individuals with disabilities; 
Whereas direct support professionals pro-
vide essential services that ensure all indi-
viduals with disabilities are— 
(1) included as a valued part of the commu-
nities in which those individuals live; 
(2) supported at home, at work, and in the 
communities of the United States; and 
(3) empowered to live with the dignity that 
all people of the United States deserve; 
Whereas, by fostering connections between 
individuals with disabilities and their fami-
lies, friends, and communities, direct sup-
port professionals ensure that individuals 
with disabilities thrive, thereby avoiding 
more costly institutional care; 
Whereas direct support professionals build 
close, respectful, and trusting relationships 
with individuals with disabilities and pro-
vide a broad range of personalized support to 
those individuals, including— 
(1) helping individuals make person-cen-
tered choices; 
(2) assisting with personal care, meal prep-
aration, medication management, and other 
aspects of daily living; 
(3) assisting individuals in accessing the 
community and securing competitive, inte-
grated employment; 
(4) providing transportation to school, 
work, religious, and recreational activities; 
(5) helping with general daily affairs, such 
as assisting with financial matters, medical 
appointments, and personal interests; 
(6) assisting individuals in the transition 
from isolated or congregate settings or serv-
ices to living in the communities of their 
choice; and 
(7) helping to keep individuals with disabil-
ities safe and healthy during the COVID–19 
pandemic, including by volunteering to quar-
antine with individuals whom they care for 
to reduce spread of the disease; 
Whereas there is a documented critical and 
increasing shortage of direct support profes-
sionals throughout the United States; 
Whereas the majority of direct support 
professionals are employed in home and com-
munity-based settings, and that trend is ex-
pected to increase over the next decade; 
Whereas 
many 
direct 
support 
profes-
sionals— 
(1) are the primary financial providers for 
their families; 
(2) are hardworking, taxpaying citizens 
who provide a critical service in the United 
States; and 
(3) continue to earn low wages, receive in-
adequate benefits, and have limited opportu-
nities for advancement, resulting in high 
turnover and vacancy rates that adversely 
affect the quality of support, safety, and 
health of individuals with disabilities; and 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 
(1999)— 
(1) recognized the importance of the dein-
stitutionalization of, and community-based 
services for, individuals with disabilities; 
and 
(2) held that, under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. 12101 et seq.), 
a State must provide community-based serv-
ices to individuals with intellectual and de-
velopmental disabilities if— 
(A) the community-based services are ap-
propriate; 
(B) the affected individual does not op-
pose receiving the community-based serv-
ices; and 
(C) the community-based services can be 
reasonably accommodated after the com-
munity has taken into account the re-
sources available to the State and the 
needs of other individuals with disabilities 
in the State: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week beginning Sep-
tember 13, 2020, as ‘‘National Direct Support 
Professionals Recognition Week’’; 
(2) recognizes the dedication and vital role 
of direct support professionals in enhancing 
the lives of individuals with disabilities of 
all ages; 
(3) appreciates the contribution of direct 
support professionals in supporting individ-
uals with disabilities and their families in 
the United States;

(4) commends direct support professionals 
for being integral to the provision of long- 
term support and services for individuals

(5) encourages the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics of the Department of Labor to collect 
data specific to direct support professionals; 
and 
(6) finds that the successful implementa-

with disabilities in the United States can de-

TRIBUTE TO COLLEEN HEALY 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, in a city 
divided by politics, a nation riven by 
disease, and an era defined by partisan 
opportunism, it is vital to remember 
that there are among us, mercifully, on 
Capitol Hill, a few men and women who 
embody the very highest ideals of hon-
esty, charity, public service, and per-
sonal integrity. 
As chairman of the Joint Economic 
Committee for the past 2 years, I have 
had the privilege of knowing one of 
these indispensable patriots. 
I rise today, before the end of my 
term as chairman of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee and at the end of her 
40th year of service on the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee, to commend to all 
of my colleagues the personal and pro-
fessional merits of Ms. Colleen Healy. 
Colleen was born in Port Allegany, 
PA, to Bob and Theresa Healy and is a 
sister to Bob, Barry, Brian, and Bret. 
She attended Port Allegany Union 
High School, where she participated in 
the school band, chorus, student gov-
ernment, and the Spanish club. As a 
senior, she was selected by her class-
mates to compete for the title of Penn-
sylvania State Laurel Queen of 1969.

Colleen next attended Penn State, 
where she earned her B.A. in Spanish 
and Latin American Studies. After 
graduating and teaching Spanish for 
several years in Florida, she came to 
Washington in 1977, first working for 
Representative Joseph Ammerman of 
Pennsylvania as his executive sec-
retary. Colleen then found her calling 
in the Joint Economic Committee, 
where she has made an indelible mark 
on generations of Representatives, Sen-
ators, and staff ever since. 
Colleen has now served on the JEC 
staff for more than half the time the 
committee has even been in existence. 
All great institutions, of course, de-
pend on institutional memory. The 
Joint Economic Committee depends on 
Colleen Healy. That is why for decades 
the first decision every incoming JEC 
chair has made, whether the chair hap-
pens to be from the House or the Sen-
ate, happens to be a Democrat or a Re-
publican, the first decision made over 
and over again is retaining Colleen’s 
invaluable services as financial direc-
tor. 
Colleen is the reason the JEC is 
known across Capitol Hill for being one 
of the most cooperative and congenial 
committees to work for, to work with, 
or to serve on because both sides trust 
Colleen. They also know they can trust 
each other. That has a ripple effect 
that is undeniably positive. 
Staffers trust that they can always 
go to Colleen with their questions and 
their problems, whether it is about the 
committee process or procedure, and 
receive gracious, knowledgeable, con-
sistent, honest answers. 
But even more impressive than her 
acumen is her essential kindness and 
grace. Colleen is known to get a flag 
flown over the Capitol for each new 
baby born to a coworker. Staffers past 
and present joke that you can’t walk 10 
minutes with Colleen from her office in 
the Dirksen Building and get very far 
because she has befriended literally ev-
eryone across the Capitol complex, re-
membering personal details about their 
lives and their families and stopping to 
talk with each person along the way. 
From Members to staffers, to interns 
and custodians, Colleen never misses 
an opportunity to make every single 
person feel important and valued and 
necessary. That, again, has ripple ef-
fects that are always positive in any 
organization and certainly are on the 
JEC. 
As one former coworker put it, when 
you talk to Colleen, you are instantly 
made to feel like the most special, 
loved, and cared-for person on Earth. 
When you step into her office, you 
know she is ready to laugh, listen, or 
cry with you. 
As another has said, despite the 
length of time she has worked in Wash-
ington, 
DC, 
Colleen 
still 
exudes 
warmth and joy—a spirit that per-
meates the committee and touches ev-
eryone she meets. This in a city not 
necessarily known for those traits. 
And though she lives it out quietly, 
she gives witness to her Catholic faith 
each and every day. Mother Teresa 
once advised: ‘‘Let no one ever come to 
you 
without 
leaving 
better 
and 
happier.’’ I can think of no better way 
to describe how Colleen Healy lives her 
life. 
In the words of the JEC vice chair, 
Representative DON BEYER, ‘‘Colleen is 
the JEC’s administrator, historian, 
sage, and most important, the heart 
and soul of the committee. She is re-
spected and beloved by decades of JEC 
Senate and House Members of both par-
ties, as well as generations of staff. Her 
decades of service have been invalu-
able.’’ 
We are all better and happier for it. 
I thank Colleen for her service to the 
committee, and I hope we are lucky 
enough to get another 40 years with her 
serving on the Joint Economic Com-
mittee. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Ohio. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor of the Senate to-
night to talk about the encouraging 
progress we have seen in finding a vac-
cine for the COVID–19 virus that has 
disrupted all of our lives and caused 
such great damage over the past year. 
From 
the 
early 
days 
of 
this 
coronavirus pandemic, a public-private 
partnership has employed scientists 
who have worked around-the-clock to 
prevent people from getting infected by 
developing effective vaccines. We saw 
the results of this effort in the last 
week with announcements from Pfizer 
and now Moderna that their interim 
success rates were above 90 percent 
during their trials. Other companies 
have vaccines at various stages of de-
velopment, and there is hope that they 
will have similar results. 
Getting safe and effective vaccines 
across the finish line will be a monu-
mental achievement. Not only are we 
witnessing unprecedented progress in 
creating an effective widespread vac-
cine, we are doing so at a speed un-
heard of in modern medical history. 
This result is going to be our best hope 
of getting out of this pandemic. With 
cases rising not only across the coun-
try but around the world, we are run-
ning out of other tools needed to stop 
the pandemic. I support the social 
distancing, wearing of masks, PPE, the 
testing, but I believe widespread inocu-
lation is the most effective way to 
avoid the negative economic and social 
impacts the virus and the subsequent 
mitigation efforts have caused. 
If these vaccines receive the expected 
emergency use authorization from the 
Food and Drug Administration over 
the coming weeks and months, this 
will be a testament to the unprece-
dented support that Congress has pro-
vided for vaccine development, the 
Trump administration’s innovative ap-
proach to cut bureaucratic redtape 
with Operation Warp Speed, and the 
commitment and ingenuity of our re-
searchers, our scientists, and our man-
ufacturers. 
The bipartisan CARES Act we passed 
here in March with unanimous support 
provided $27 billion in funding for coun-
termeasures against COVID, including 
funding this important vaccine devel-
opment research. It was money well 
spent. 
Thanks to these funds and the inno-
vative approach by the administration, 
we have been able to invest in building 
the infrastructure to begin manufac-
turing these vaccines now so that if the 
vaccine is approved, we can quickly 
ramp up distribution. This two-track 
approach also involves ramping up 
large-scale clinical trials, which are 
critical to furthering our scientific un-
derstanding 
of 
this 
pandemic 
and 
verifying the safety and effectiveness 
of these vaccines. By using these 
CARES Act funds to invest in both re-
search and trials and in manufacturing 
at the same time, we are able to ensure 
that the trials are thorough and me-
thodical while also ensuring that if and 
when approved there is vaccine ready 
to be distributed. 
At the same time, the Food and Drug 
Administration, which is the Federal 
agency responsible for approving the 
use of any new vaccine, has followed 
the science and moved cautiously. As 
an example, they have actually raised 
the standards needed for giving an 
emergency use authorization for a vac-
cine. Normally, a vaccine only needs to 
be effective about 50 percent of the 
time to be approved under the EUA, 
emergency use authorization, but with 
the coronavirus vaccine, the standard 
is much higher. By requiring compa-
nies to collect more rigorous informa-
tion to show longer lasting results 
from their respective vaccine can-
didates, this will help ensure greater 
confidence in the system, and I am 
grateful that they took these addi-
tional careful steps. 
This progress on the vaccine is crit-
ical for our economic recovery as well. 
When a vaccine and therapeutics are 
authorized by the FDA and made wide-
ly available and people actually get 
vaccinated, all of us will feel safer re-
turning to the workplace, retail estab-
lishments, restaurants, churches and 
other places of worship, and schools, as 
well as feeling more comfortable gath-
ering with friends and family. We will 
finally be able to truly reopen and get 
millions of Americans back to work. In 
short, a widely available vaccine is our 
best bet for getting America back to 
normal—something we all are des-
perate for. 
Last month, I received a briefing 
from CTI Clinical Trial and Consulting 
Services, a research company that is 
based in my hometown of Cincinnati, 
OH. I met with them to receive a brief-
ing to find out what is going on in Ohio 
and what they are doing around the 
country. CTI is a global leader in actu-
ally executing these clinical trials that 
we always talk about for these vac-
cines and therapeutics, and right now

November 17, 2020 
they are helping to conduct clinical 
trials on a potential COVID vaccine 
being developed by a number of compa-
nies, including Janssen, J & J. That is 
Janssen, Johnson & Johnson. 
I was impressed with the progress 
they had made in their phase 1 and 
phase 2 trials for the J & J vaccine, as 
well as the precautions they are taking 
with regard to safety and privacy of 
participants in the trial. In fact, the 
previous trial of this vaccine found 99 
percent of participants developed anti-
bodies to COVID–19, and 98 percent still 
had these antibodies in their system 
after 29 days. These are encouraging 
figures that suggest that this J & J 
vaccine could prove to be another use-
ful tool in our toolkit to fight COVID– 
19, but there is still a lot of work to be 
done. 
CTI explained to me that they were 
focused on encouraging more people to 
join their trials. I asked if it would 
help if I signed up, and they said yes. 
Along with tens of thousands of other 
participants, I am now joining this 
trial for this promising new vaccine. 
Like other participants in the pro-
gram, I don’t know if I got the vaccine 
or if I got a placebo. 
I enrolled in this vaccine trial for 
really three reasons. One is because I 
think it is so important to get this vac-
cine moving, and these trials are really 
important to having that be successful. 
In my view, again, the vaccine is the 
most effective way for us to defeat this 
coronavirus. 
Second, I enrolled because I want to 
encourage others to join these trials 
around the country. If you are inter-
ested, go online. Look at the vaccine 
trials and join one in your community. 
And, third, I hope it will convince my 
fellow Ohioans and others that getting 
vaccinated makes sense. 
There is a concerning Gallup poll 
from last month that found that only 
half of Americans are comfortable get-
ting a COVID–19 vaccine, and 50 per-
cent of us are not comfortable at this 
point getting vaccinated. Actually, 
that is down from August, when two- 
thirds of Americans said they would be 
willing to be vaccinated. This concerns 
me a lot. 
I suspect in part this is happening be-
cause of the rhetoric we have heard 
from some public officials casting 
doubt on a vaccine solely because it 
may be approved by the Trump admin-
istration’s FDA. We need to stop play-
ing politics with people’s health and let 
the science and the data determine 
which vaccines get approved. The FDA 
is being very cautious, and they are 
being driven by science. Casting doubt 
on the efficacy of a vaccine to try to 
score political points is dangerous and 
needs to stop. 
Public confidence in vaccines is de-
clining at exactly the time that we 
need these vaccines the most, and we 
need to do what we can to reverse that 
trend. My hope is that being involved 
firsthand I can use my platform as a 
Senator to help give people confidence 
that these new vaccines being devel-
oped are safe and effective. The more 
folks participate in these trials, the 
sooner they will have the complete 
data to finalize this phase of the trial 
and move on to the FDA approval proc-
ess. 
But just as important as partici-
pating in these vaccine trials is what 
we do here as legislators in Congress to 
ensure that these vaccines can con-
tinue to be developed and deployed 
safely and rapidly. As I mentioned ear-
lier, the CARES Act provided $27 bil-
lion for the development of vaccines 
and other countermeasures—an unprec-
edented show of support from Congress 
in our fight to defeat the underlying 
healthcare challenges of this pandemic. 
Unfortunately, since that bill was 
passed—the CARES bill—way back in 
March, 8 months ago, we have been un-
able to focus on following up with more 
funding to help this effort. Twenty- 
seven billion dollars is a lot of money, 
but it only gets us so far in an effort 
like this. 
What is also missing from the uses 
for this $27 billion is the ability to fund 
a campaign to explain to Americans 
that there is a safe and effective vac-
cine out there that they can use, that 
the science has been followed. As I 
mentioned, there is a lot of vaccine 
hesitancy right now. It existed before 
this pandemic. Unfortunately, it has 
been made worse by some elected offi-
cials trying to politicize this science- 
driven effort. 
That is why I am working on bipar-
tisan legislation to support a national 
awareness campaign that would em-
power HHS to cut through the politics 
and promote the scientific advance-
ments we have made in order to in-
crease public confidence. 
We don’t have a vaccine yet, and we 
are still facing another round of shut-
downs, with little help to support those 
who will be impacted by it. That is the 
reason we need to do more here in 
Washington right now to ensure that 
the healthcare response to this pan-
demic does not falter, because this cri-
sis is getting worse, not better. In my 
home State of Ohio and around the 
country, we are seeing this, and we can 
make a difference here. 
In Ohio, the number of daily cases 
has risen every day for the past month. 
We are seeing double what we saw just 
a few weeks ago. 
In the United States, we are now 
averaging more than 100,000 new cases 
per day, double the rate from just a 
month ago. As was predicted, it got 
colder, people are inside more, and the 
third wave has arrived. 
Unfortunately, we have also seen an 
increase in Ohio in hospitalizations, in 
ICU patients, and, sadly, in fatalities 
along with these new cases. 
We need to do more to help the econ-
omy, too, and that is another reason 
we need a COVID–19 package—a stim-
ulus package—because as the pandemic 
has worsened, the impressive economic 
growth we were seeing has slowed down 
at a time when the economy is still 
down 10 million jobs since February. 
What we really don’t want is for those 
ten million people, in a slowdown of 
the economy, to become long-term un-
employed and who may never reenter 
the workforce. And, of course, certain 
sectors—like hospitality, restaurants, 
hotels, travel, and entertainment—are 
still struggling badly, with no end in 
sight, as some States are beginning to 
re-implement stricter social distancing 
measurers and even to close down these 
facilities in order to counter the spread 
of the virus. 
I am pleased that Leader MCCONNELL 
has called on Congress to work to-
gether to pass another coronavirus re-
sponse package before the end of the 
year. We can’t afford to wait any 
longer. It is my hope that my Demo-
cratic colleagues recognize the urgency 
as well. And I have talked to a number 
of them who do. We have to refrain 
from making this political at this 
point. We have to figure out how to 
work together to find common ground. 
If we can come together and get a bi-
partisan coronavirus bill passed before 
the end of this year that takes a com-
monsense 
approach 
targeting 
the 
healthcare challenges of this pandemic, 
targeting the economic consequences, 
we will not only help the men and 
women 
working 
tirelessly 
in 
labs 
around the country to fight this dis-
ease, but we will send a clear message 
to the American people that we are 
with them in this fight. 
And as we continue this critical na-
tional effort, let’s be sure we are doing 
our part here in Congress to pass legis-
lation that provides additional funding 
for treatments and therapies for the 
coronavirus so that we can be sure we 
have the resources necessary to treat 
the virus as people get it. 
The time is now for us to put the par-
tisanship aside and figure out how we 
can work together to give the Amer-
ican people a little hope, to address the 
healthcare crisis that is in all of our 
States, and to ensure that the eco-
nomic 
consequences 
are 
not 
dev-
astating for the people we represent. 
I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether and to do that before we recess 
for the holidays. 
I yield back my time.

IN HONOR OF REVEREND HAROLD 
G. WILLIAMS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Harold G. Williams of 
Huntingdon County for his service in the 
United States Navy. Harold is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for his serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered 
the call to serve and fight for us—at a great 
cost. Truly, our veterans are the best of Amer-
ica. 
In Congress, it is my privilege—and my re-
sponsibility—to stand up for those who have 
served our country in uniform, as well as to 
recognize these brave Americans. As a nation, 
we are indebted to them. On behalf of the 
13th Congressional District, I thank Harold for 
his service to our nation and our community.

HONORING STEVEN M. DYL 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Steven Dyl in celebra-
tion of his decades of work as a father, Fire 
Chief, and leader in the Town of Kearny and 
the County of Hudson. I am proud to have 
such a dedicated and hardworking individual 
in the Ninth Congressional District of New Jer-
sey. A lifelong resident of Kearny and a prod-
uct of the Kearny school system, Steven Dyl 
dedicated his life to the safety and security of 
his hometown. 
Steven’s commitment to serve started at a 
very young age. With the gumption to hold 
regular meetings with then Mayor Henry Hill, 
Steven advocated for the establishment of an 
emergency rescue squad in the Town of Kear-
ny, resulting in the creation of the Kearny 
Emergency Ambulance squad, an organization 
responsible for protecting tens of thousands of 
people. Furthermore, prior to his career in fire 
safety, Mr. Dyl worked for the McCabe Ambu-
lance in Bayonne and as an EMT for Univer-
sity Hospital in Newark, formally beginning his 
career in public safety. 
Appointed to the Kearny Fire Department 
(KFD) on October 6, 1984, Steven Dyl would 
start his thirty-five-year long career with the 
department. Rising through the ranks from 
Fire Captain, to Deputy Fire Chief and then 
Chief in 2007, Steven has a long history of 
hard work and commitment to reflect upon as 
he retires. Present for many of the depart-
ment’s greatest challenges such as the attack 
on 9/11 and the economic downturn in 2008, 
Steven’s leadership would play a key role in 
many of the major initiatives enacted by the 
Kearny Fire Department. I know his guidance 
and strong force of character will be missed 
by everyone at the department. 
Working closely with other members of his 
community, Steven has raised money for the 
people of Kearny and firefighters across New 
Jersey. While titles may come and go, Mr. Dyl 
displays the intrinsic qualities that make him a 
leader irrespective of the title he holds. Re-
gardless of how Steven chooses to spend his 
retirement, I know he will remain a firefighter 
in spirit. Retirement means a transition into a 
new phase of life, and I have every confidence 
that Steven will make this new phase a won-
derful, productive and exciting time. 
As the representative for New Jersey’s 
Ninth Congressional District, I have the great 
honor of representing the residents of Kearny 
in Congress and it gives me great pride to rec-
ognize one of their native sons who has spent 
his life serving the public. I can say with con-
fidence that Steven is not only a good leader, 
but an incredible public servant—the kind who 
can be counted on both in good times and in 
bad times. 
The job of a United States Congressman in-
volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to working with and recognizing the 
efforts of individuals like Mr. Dyl. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, friends, family, and the residents of 
New Jersey in recognizing Steven Dyl for his 
outstanding work, as we celebrate his dec-
ades of distinguished service to the Ninth 
Congressional District and the members of his 
family and community.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
BETTE BOATMUN 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of an esteemed 
leader 
in 
Contra 
Costa 
County, 
Bette 
Boatmun. 
Bette was appointed to the Contra Costa 
Water District Board of Directors in 1974 and 
has held that position for the past 46 years. 
When initially applying for the Contra Costa 
Water District Board, Bette was driven by her 
desire to see more women in the water indus-
try. During her time on the Board of Directors, 
Bette has served as both the President and 
Vice President. Her leadership has been inte-
gral in the implementation of many projects, 
including the building of the Randall-Bold 
Water Treatment Plant and the Multi-Purpose 
Pipeline, construction and expansion of the 
Los Vaqueros Reservoir, and an upgrade to 
the Bollman Water Treatment Plant. 
Bette is known by her colleagues as an ad-
vocate for customers of the Water District, 
demonstrated by her work to provide low-in-
come assistance and avid support of water 
education. One of California’s public dem-
onstration gardens, recognized by the U.S. 
Bureau of Reclamation, was named in her 
honor: the Bette Boatmun Conservation Gar-
den. One of Bette’s many accolades for her 
outstanding career includes the 2013 Hollings-
worth Award of Excellence from the California 
Special Districts Association. 
In addition to her numerous professional 
contributions, Bette is a member of many 
community organizations, including the Con-
cord 
American 
Association 
of 
University 
Women and League of Women Voters of Dia-
blo Valley. She has also served as President 
of the Association of California Water Agen-
cies and chair of several organizations, includ-
ing the Governing Board of East County Water 
Management Association, the Contra Costa 
Special Districts’ Association, and the Sanita-
tion and Water Agencies of Contra Costa 
County. 
We wish Bette well as she retires from the 
Contra Costa Water District Board of Directors 
and thank her for inspiring many more to fol-
low in her footsteps. Please join me in hon-
oring Bette Boatmun for her many contribu-
tions to our community.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
FREDERICK HILL MCDONALD 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to reflect upon the life of Frederick Hill McDon-
ald, an institution of our courts serving almost 
three decades as a Lucas County Common 
Pleas judge. A Vietnam War Veteran, a father, 
a grandfather, a husband, and a missed and 
cherished member of our community. 
A native of Poland, Ohio, Judge McDonald 
graduated Poland High School and then at-
tended Carleton College graduating with high 
marks. 
Following 
his 
undergrad, 
he 
jumpstarted his law career in receiving his law 
degree from Georgetown university, then soon 
after was honorably admitted to the Ohio Bar 
in 1968. 
In the genesis of his career, McDonald 
joined the Toledo Aid Society in 1970, then 
took the step into the legal world officially in 
becoming an assistant county prosecutor. 
After a few years of service, he was selected 
as an assistant U.S. attorney in Toledo, and 
after serving one year as a Judge on the To-
ledo Municipal Court bench, his candor and 
professionalism propelled him to be appointed 
to the Common Pleas Court where his career 
blossomed. 
Judge Frederick McDonald’s time on the 
court was highlighted by his service of equality 
and equity on the bench and in his own life. 
In 1997 he received the Arabella Babb Mans-
field Award from the Toledo Women’s Bar As-
sociation, in accordance with his commitment

to diversity and his general tenacity and grit 
on the bench. 
In his tenure in our courts of law, Judge 
McDonald displayed a fervent commitment to 
decency and democracy like no other. At 71 
years of age he retired his robes and was re-
membered by his peers as a dedicated col-
laborator and mentor, providing leadership and 
discernment on challenging issues. 
A Toledo resident, his life was one filled 
with love and devotion to family. His three 
grandsons look onto a great example of a 
legal legacy and a profoundly sweet man. His 
Wife, Holly Sydlow, shared his love of law in 
her career as an assistant U.S. attorney. 
Judge McDonald led everyday with the in-
tention of imparting his legal knowledge unto 
the next generation of impactful lawyers and 
legal professionals, passing the merits of his 
valuable tenure unto the future of our courts. 
During his time in the courts, Judge McDon-
ald saved all of his jury instructions from his 
years of trial digitally and passed them on to 
a currently seated Judge, thus his legacy and 
institutional knowledge will live on within the 
systems that miss him so. 
Our courts and our hearts mourn the Joss 
of Judge McDonald. I express my great sym-
pathy for his family and all who were lucky 
enough to call him friend or peer.

IN RECOGNITION OF TOWNSHIP 
SUPERVISOR BRIAN LOFTUS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Brian Loftus and his years 
of distinguished service to Grosse Ile Town-
ship. His leadership and community impact 
are worthy of commendation. 
In 2008, Brian Loftus became Grosse Ile 
Township Supervisor. In this position, Loftus 
has moderated the Board of Trustees, led the 
development of the township budget, overseen 
property assessment, and maintained town-
ship records. In addition, he has been a liai-
son to the Downtown Development Authority, 
served on the Elections Commission, and has 
appointed the members of a variety of other 
township commissions, among other tasks. 
Supervisor Loftus’s leadership has come at a 
pivotal moment in our state’s history. As com-
munities across Michigan are grappling with 
the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, Su-
pervisor Loftus has remained committed to en-
suring Grosse Ile Township continues to be a 
vibrant, diverse, and welcoming residential 
community for all. 
Supervisor Brian Loftus’s sense of dedica-
tion transcends Grosse Ile Township. Prior to 
serving Grosse Ile as township supervisor, 
Loftus served our nation in uniform. Loftus 
joined the Air Force in 1970 and graduated 
from the United States Air Force Academy in 
1974. He served on active duty as a pilot until 
being transferred to the Michigan Air National 
Guard in 1981, where he continued serving in 
several operation and staff duty positions until 
his retirement in September 2003. Over the 
course of 33 years of military service, Loftus 
has come to deeply understand the meaning 
of duty, sacrifice, and commitment to bettering 
one’s community. Undoubtably, he applied 
these principles throughout his tenure as 
township supervisor. 
In addition, Loftus has been an active mem-
ber of several community organizations. He 
volunteers with the Grosse Ile Historical Soci-
ety, Friends of the Detroit River, and the De-
troit River International Wildlife Refuge Alli-
ance, to name a few. Throughout all capac-
ities, Loftus has been recognized as a humble 
and compassionate leader who strives to ef-
fect lasting change. He has been a strong 
voice for Grosse Ile Township and used his 
authority to bring the community together and 
positively impact the lives of countless resi-
dents. Loftus’s impact will forever endure, and 
we are all grateful for his years of service to 
our community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Township Supervisor Brian 
Loftus. We are proud to celebrate his work, 
accomplishments, and significant community 
impact. We thank him for his outstanding lead-
ership and wish him the best of luck in his fu-
ture endeavors.

HONORING WES AND JUDY PIERCE 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to honor Wes and Judy Pierce, two 
incredible members of our Central Texas com-
munity who have devoted their energies and 
talents toward providing support and aid to our 
incredible servicemembers, veterans, first re-
sponders, and their families. 
Originally from Illinois, Wes and Judy mar-
ried in April 1987. Their journey from child 
rearing to becoming proud grandparents led 
them to Texas in 2001. After having five of 
their own sons serve in the military, Wes and 
Judy became increasingly aware of the unmet 
needs of our returning veterans. Through their 
own children’s difficulties with accessing and 
finding resources, Heroes Night Out was born. 
Heroes Night Out is a non-profit community- 
based organization that is dedicated to en-
hancing and supporting servicemembers, vet-
erans, first responders, and their family mem-
bers through programs and services in a car-
ing and safe environment enhanced by the 
contributions of peers and battle buddies. 
HNO can quickly address the unique situa-
tions they experience by creating an imme-
diate and trusting relationship. 
Having nurtured Heroes Night Out into a 
valued part of the Central Texas community, 
Wes and Judy are passing the torch to a new 
generation of leadership. Their richly-deserved 
retirement is to be celebrated and enjoyed. I 
proudly join their friends and colleagues in 
gratitude for their enormous contributions to 
those who work and sacrifice so much for us.

RANDY DECKER 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise be-
fore you today to remember and honor Randy 
Decker, a man of tremendous character who 
passed away on February 4, 2020 after a 
brief, yet brave battle with an aggressive ill-
ness. 
The youngest of 12 children and the first to 
be born in a hospital, Randy was born on July 
25, 1950. Randy was drafted and served in 
the U.S. Army. After, he attended Illinois State 
University where he earned his Bachelor of 
Science in Business. Family was always a pri-
ority for Randy. Randy was married to his be-
loved wife Mona Belle Decker for 49 years. 
Randy could always be found supporting his 
children, being involved in their various sports 
activities throughout the years. Randy spent 
his civilian career in sales management roles 
to provide for his family. In his latest years, 
raising and supporting his five grandchildren 
was one of his greatest joys. Randy will be 
laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery 
later this year. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Randy Decker for 
his service and the impact he made in his 
community.

RECOGNIZING BLUE KNIGHTS 
PENNSYLVANIA CHAPTER IV 
HON. DANIEL MEUSER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise today to recognize the 
Blue Knight’s International Law Enforcement 
Motorcycle Club Pennsylvania Chapter IV. 
The Blue Knights is a non-profit fraternal or-
ganization of active and retired law enforce-
ment officers and veterans who enjoy riding 
motorcycles. A group of several law enforce-
ment officers formed the first chapter of the 
Blue Knights in Bangor, Maine in 1974.Today 
they have over 600 chapters and nearly 
20,000 members all over the world. 
The Blue Knights are dedicated to devel-
oping a fraternal spirit among those in the law 
enforcement and veterans community who 
enjoy riding motorcycles. As a group, the Blue 
Knights engage in charitable activities such as 
supporting local law enforcement causes, hon-
oring our veterans, and assisting children in 
need. 
The Blue Knights Pennsylvania Chapter IV 
is very active in supporting the Berks commu-
nity. Recently the Blue Knights held their 1st 
Annual Benefit Ride & Pig Roast, raising near-
ly $5,000 in support of the Berks County Sher-
iffs Office K–9 Unit. This Memorial Day, the 
Blue Knights also escorted 50,000 American 
flags that were distributed and placed on the 
graves of deceased veterans across Berks 
County. The Blue Knights are steadfast sup-
porters of those who serve our communities 
and our nation. 
Members of the Blue Knights have not only 
donned the uniform and served our commu-
nities and our nation themselves, but they also 
continue their service as good citizens in aid-
ing law enforcement and veterans causes. Our 
community and our nation are better for their 
continued selfless service and dedication. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing Pennsylvania Chapter 
IV of the Blue Knights and thank them for their 
continued service to our nation and our com-
munities.

HONORING CAROL MARIN 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Carol Marin and to 
honor her distinguished career in print and 
electronic journalism. Few reporters have 
done more to build public trust in the press 
than Carol Marin, and her lifetime commitment 
to unbiased, in-depth reporting has elevated 
public discourse and held public officials ac-
countable to their constituents and to the prin-
ciples of good government. 
Born in Chicago, Carol spent her childhood 
in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, part of the 8th 
Congressional District that I represent. After 
graduating from the University of Illinois, she 
worked briefly as a high school English teach-
er before moving to Tennessee and beginning 
a career in journalism, first as a talk show host 
and reporter in Knoxville, and then as a news 
anchor and reporter in Nashville. 
In 1978, Carol returned home to Chicago as 
a news anchor and reporter. She quickly es-
tablished a reputation as a relentless inves-
tigative reporter, and demonstrated a deep 
commitment to the highest standards of integ-
rity and journalistic excellence. In 1997, that 
commitment became a national news story 
when she resigned from her news anchor 
desk to protest the hiring of a controversial 
talk show host whose presence she believed 
would undermine her credibility as a journalist 
and the work of her newsroom. She moved on 
to national broadcast work, serving as a cor-
respondent on the CBS Evening News and 
‘‘60 Minutes,’’ covering important stories, in-
cluding reporting on the September 11 terror 
attacks while covered in ash from the collapse 
of the World Trade Center towers. 
In 2002, Carol formed Marin Corp Produc-
tions, an independent documentary company 
providing content to media outlets including 
CNN and the New York Times/Discovery 
Channel. She also authored political com-
mentary for the Chicago Sun-Times, and 
served as a contributor to Chicago Tonight, an 
award-winning nightly news show broadcast 
on WTTW, Chicago’s public television station. 
Carol Marin has been honored with almost 
every important award in broadcast journalism. 
She is the recipient of three George Foster 
Peabody 
Awards, 
two 
DuPont-Columbia 
Awards, a George Polk Award, two national 
Emmy Awards and at least 15 regional Emmy 
Awards. Carol has been inducted in the Chi-
cago Journalism Hall of Fame, and the Silver 
Circle of the Chicago/Midwest chapter of the 
National Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences. 
Carol recently announced that she is step-
ping away from her work as a broadcast jour-
nalist after the November 2020 national elec-
tions. I am glad to note that she will continue 
to inspire and mentor the next generation of 
journalists as co-director of the Center for 
Journalism Integrity and Excellence at DePaul 
University in Chicago. 
At a time when journalism is under relent-
less attack by forces that seek to undermine 
our democratic norms, I am honored to cele-
brate the career of a reporter who personifies 
honesty, integrity and a fearless willingness to 
speak truth to power. Carol Marin’s passion 
for her life’s work is best expressed by her 
own words: ‘‘There’s a sense of mission for 
most of us in my business, a sense of pur-
pose . . . the biggest lesson I have learned of 
all—every story, every day, every year that I 
do this—is that it is a privilege to be a re-
porter.’’

RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE 
MARTIN FROST 
HON. LLOYD DOGGETT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my great admiration for a 
former colleague, and friend. Martin Frost, 
who always rose to the aid of those Texans 
he served so well for almost 30 years here in 
the House. He also ably led our party and our 
Caucus, serving as chair of the DCCC and the 
House Democratic Caucus. 
Following his outstanding service in Wash-
ington, Martin Frost devoted much of his post- 
congressional life to the FMC, the Association 
of Former Members of Congress. This chal-
lenging year, 2020, brought to a conclusion 
his term as President of the FMC, after many 
years of serving in various leadership posi-
tions within it. 
Many of my colleagues are familiar with the 
democracy building and civic education work 
the FMC conducts, including its outstanding 
Congressional Study Groups. Martin Frost pro-
vided the leadership for FMC to achieve in-
credible growth in all of these activities. 
He was instrumental in strengthening FMC 
finances, for example, by creating and growing 
an Endowment Investment Fund. He greatly 
increased the number of actively involved 
Former Members from both sides of the aisle. 
And with his guidance, FMC now reaches a 
much greater number of students through the 
Congress-to-Campus program. 
The extent of Martin’s tremendous impact 
cannot be done real justice with these brief re-
marks, but I speak for everyone involved with 
FMC—its board of directors, its membership, 
and its staff—when I state that, thanks to Mar-
tin Frost, like every organization which he has 
led—FMC is better, more effective. and more 
impactful than it has ever been. 
Especially during these divisive political 
times, when we need more bridges, not walls, 
Members like Martin Frost and organizations 
like FMC deserve our gratitude for attempting 
to bridge the political divide, serving as ex-
perts on Congress as an institution, and re-
connecting citizens with their representative 
government, all in the service of strengthening 
our democracy. 
Our political infrastructure, like our actual in-
frastructure, needs the attention and mainte-
nance to keep our economy strong, our citi-
zens safe and healthy, and to preserve our 
democracy. I am not planning to join Martin 
soon as an FMC member, but when I eventu-
ally do, I know that it will be a stronger organi-
zation because of his dedication. This is a

HONORING MR. FRANCISCO 
MANTILLA 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Francisco Mantilla for 
his commitment to the people of New Jersey. 
Mr. Mantilla came to this country from Ecua-
dor in pursuit of the American Dream. A busi-
nessman, father and community leader, Fran-
cisco leads a rich life here in the United 
States. He is a role model for many in the Silk 
City. Today, I ask that we honor him for all his 
outstanding work. 
Born to Mr. Francisco Arturo Mantilla Sr. 
and Rosa Mantilla Faz, Francisco’s story 
starts in Ecuador. A studious and dedicated 
individual, Francisco would complete high 
school with high honors and by the age of 
twenty-one, earn a law degree from the 
Catholic University of Guayaquil. Mr. Mantilla, 
after completing his education, made the 
brave decision to leave Ecuador for greater 
opportunity here in the United States. 
In 1970, Francisco arrived in the Silk City. In 
Paterson, Mr. Mantilla would begin his journey 
as an American citizen with dreams of a better 
life for his family. Living briefly in New York, 
Francisco met his wonderful wife Elsa and in 
1972, resettled permanently in the City of 
Paterson. Married a year later in 1973, Fran-
cisco and Elsa would have three children, 
Rosa, Francisco and Elsa Elizabeth. 
The year is 1980, and together with his wife, 
Elsa’s Fashions is opened on 21st Ave. in 
Paterson. The second ever Latino owned busi-
ness in the immediate area. Elsa’s Fashions 
would become an important gathering place 
and respected establishment for the Latin 
American community. The owner and oper-
ator, Francisco would encourage and support 
other Latin Americans to start their own small 
business. Offering guidance and leadership, 
there has been no greater advocate for the 
businesses here in the Silk City. 
A founding member of many community or-
ganizations, we can see Francisco’s work 
throughout the State of New Jersey. Starting 
the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 
Paterson and the 21st Ave. Business Associa-
tion, there are hundreds if not thousands of 
small business owners who have Francisco to 
thank for his contributions. A liaison with the 
City of Paterson, Mr. Mantilla is a constant ad-
vocate before the Mayor and council on behalf 
of the small businesses on 21st Ave. 
Francisco Mantilla has shared his prosperity 
with the community. Hosting toy drives, voter 
registration drives and clothing and food drives 
for the less fortunate, Francisco gives back 
and raises others up in the City of Paterson. 
Recognized by many different organizations 
for his community activism, Francisco was 
named the ‘‘Patersonian of the Year’’, ‘‘Entre-
preneur of the Year’’ and ‘‘The Ambassador of 
21st Avenue’’. I, on the other hand, know him 
to be my friend. 
The job of a United States Congressman in-
volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to working with and recognizing the 
efforts of individuals like Mr. Francisco Man-
tilla. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, friends, family, and the residents of 
New Jersey in recognizing Francisco Mantilla, 
as we celebrate his years of distinguished 
service to the people of the Ninth Congres-
sional District.

STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF S. 
910, THE NATIONAL SEA GRANT 
COLLEGE 
PROGRAM 
AMEND-
MENTS ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 16, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of S. 910, the National Sea 
Grant College Program Amendments Act of 
2020. 
For decades, the Sea Grant College Pro-
gram has provided essential oceans-focused 
research and support for our communities na-
tion-wide and especially now as we face the 
impacts of climate change on coastal commu-
nities. The bill before us today would authorize 
an increase in funding for our Sea Grant pro-
grams and enhance our efforts to study, con-
serve and effectively use U.S. coastal re-
sources. 
Climate change is wreaking havoc on our 
coasts, including throughout my Hawaii where 
coastal roads are crumbling as sea level rise 
and erosion take their toll. Coral reefs, which 
are vital resources for our ecosystems and 
provide protection from storm surges to our 
coasts, are facing mass bleaching events due 
to warming waters. Fish stocks are moving 
from traditional areas because of warming 
waters. The Sea Grant Program works with 
communities to research these issues and 
many more to provide useful information to 
make informed management decisions based 
on science. 
The University of Hawaii Sea Grant College 
Program (Hawaii Sea Grant) is a prime exam-
ple of focus on critical issues related to sus-
tainable coastal development, tourism, hazard 
resiliency, sustainable aquaculture, indigenous 
knowledge, 
and 
the 
impacts 
of 
climate 
change. In all of its efforts, Hawaii Sea Grant 
strives to promote stewardship of Hawaii’s 
coastal 
ecosystems 
and 
increase 
public 
awareness of the need to preserve and pro-
tect Hawaii’s precious marine resources. 
Just some Hawaii Sea Grant impacts in 
2018 included: 
Created or sustained 43 jobs for an eco-
nomic benefit of at least $4.2 million; 
Generated $6.8 million in leveraged funds, 
resulting in a return on the federal investment 
of approximately 200 percent; 
Supported the education and training of 53 
undergraduates and graduate students; 
Assisted 47 communities throughout Hawaii 
with implementing sustainable development 
practices and policies; 
Helped 762 fishers adopt safe and sustain-
able fishing practices; 
Educated over 30,000 K–12 students in Ha-
waii through Sea Grant education activities; 
Helped restore an estimated 5,500 acres of 
coastal ecosystems; and 
Improved community resilience statewide 
through outreach and distribution of more than 
75,000 copies of the Homeowner’s Handbook 
to Prepare for Natural Hazards publication. 
These impacts prove the longstanding im-
portance of Sea Grant to many such commu-
nities nationwide. I am proud to support this 
continued work and urge all my colleagues to 
pass S. 910.

Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act of 2020 and H.R. 
2281, the Easy MAT for Opioid Addiction Act. 
I’m proud to have advanced these bipartisan 
bills through my Health Subcommittee and I’m 
pleased to support them on the Floor today. 
According to the most recent CDC data, in 
2018, 67,000 Americans died of a drug over-
dose. Overdoses in 2018 alone killed more 
Americans than the Vietnam War. This is a 
national crisis. 
In 2016 Congress passed the 21st Century 
Cures Act and CARA, and in 2018 the SUP-
PORT Act was signed into law to stem the 
tide of addiction and devastation that the 
opioid crisis has created. 
Yet, despite our legislative efforts to in-
crease access to medication-assisted treat-
ment or MAT, according to a 2019 National 
Academies of Science report, more than 80 
percent of the 2 million people with opioid use 
disorder are not receiving MAT and families

and children affected by the opioids crisis also 
are not receiving the care they need. 
That’s why it is so important to pass the 
Easy MAT for Opioid Addiction Act. The Easy 
MAT for Opioid Addiction Act requires the 
Drug Enforcement Agency to revise regula-
tions to allow a practitioner to administer up to 
a three-day supply of narcotic drugs to an indi-
vidual at one time for purposes of relieving 
acute withdrawal symptoms while the indi-
vidual awaits arrangements for narcotic treat-
ment. This will reduce unnecessary medical 
visits and increase access to a safe and im-
portant treatment. 
H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act authorizes $1.5 billion 
per year through grants to help states and trib-
al organizations build out their responses to 
the opioid crisis through provision of additional 
treatment beds, hiring the workforce nec-
essary to expand treatment and recovery op-
tions, bridging gaps identified in systems of 
care, and supporting robust prevention cam-
paigns. 
These are common sense bills that will save 
lives and I urge all my colleagues to support 
these bills.

HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life, service, and sacrifice of 
Chief Warrant Officer 3 Dallas Garza. Chief 
Warrant Officer Garza grew up in Janesville 
and attended Parker High School before mov-
ing out of state. 
It was Garza’s dream to fly Black Hawks for 
the U.S. Army. In 2005, Garza joined the 
Army, following the footsteps of his father and 
grandfather. Garza served in Iraq and Afghani-
stan and was most recently assigned to a 
peacekeeping mission. 
Chief Warrant Officer Garza lost his life 
when his helicopter crashed off the coast of 
Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula on November 12, 
2020. Garza was a true patriot who humbly 
served our country. On Garza’s flight helmet, 
he wore Wisconsin and Texas state flags to 
represent his family. A fellow soldier said that 
Garza made everyone around him better. 
Garza is remembered by those who knew him 
as being smart, motivated, charismatic, and 
someone who loved our country. 
Our nation will be forever grateful for Chief 
Warrant Officer Garza’s sacrifice. On behalf of 
Wisconsin’s First Congressional District, I 
thank Chief Warrant Officer Garza for his serv-
ice. We will never forget Chief Warrant Officer 
Garza’s sacrifice. My prayers are with his fam-
ily, his children, and friends.

RECOGNIZING CHAPLAIN WILLIAM 
E. 
WALKER 
SENIOR 
AS 
CON-
STITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to recognize Chaplain William E. 
Walker Senior, Post Chaplain of Oceanside 
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Memorial 
Post I 0577 and Disabled American Veterans 
(DAV) Tri-Cities Chapter 95, as my Con-
stituent of the Month. A true American patriot, 
after returning from serving in the United 
States Marine Corps (USMC) from l976 to 
1988 and receiving the Combat Action Ribbon 
for his service in Saigon, Vietnam, Comrade 
Walker worked at Marine Corps Community 
Services (MCCS) for 15 years until his retire-
ment. 
Following his retirement and feeling that his 
service for this country wasn’t over, Chaplain 
Walker made himself a fierce ally and fighter 
for veterans throughout North County. Dedi-
cated to his convictions and supporting his fel-
low veterans, Chaplain Walker is especially 
known for visiting, calling, or helping wherever 
he can for VFW and DAV comrades who are 
in nursing homes, hospitals, rehab clinics, 
homebound, or in need of assistance. His 
commitment to the ministry and duties of 
Chaplain are beyond reproach, always there 
to lend a hand, offer spiritual guidance, and 
prayer. 
Chaplain Walker’s service for local veterans 
groups in California’s 49th Congressional Dis-
trict is commendable. During an especially dif-
ficult time for our country as the COVID–19 
pandemic swept through the nation and our 
community, Chaplain Walker continued to go 
above and beyond in helping local veterans 
and their families during a desperate time of 
need. Volunteering with the North County 
Food Bank, Chaplain Walker loaded his car 
with food and supplies to distribute to home-
bound veterans and veteran’s widows strug-
gling from the financial effects of the pan-
demic. 
In order to properly celebrate Veterans Day, 
we must do more than offer our thanks and 
appreciation. We need to fight for the support 
and resources that veterans have earned and 
deserve, and that’s exactly what Chaplain 
Walker does every single day. As long as I 
have the privilege to serve on the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, I will look to Chap-

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
DAVID L. SPANGLER 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the legacy of an honored veteran, 
an intense advocate for environmentalism, a 
beloved husband, father, grandfather, friend, 
and an installation on our Great Lakes, David 
L. Spangler. 
Born in Defiance, OH, David created a story 
for himself of valor, service, family, and inten-
tional advocacy. After honorable service in the 
U.S. Army, where he received a Purple Heart 
as well as a Bronze Star, he became a career 
operations manager at Johns-Manville for 37 
years. After his retirement he pursued his love 
of his second home, Lake Erie, in licensing a 
fishing charter boat in Lake Erie’s Western 
Basin. After 27 years on the Lake, he is rec-
ognized as the fiercest advocate for the health 
and sustainability of the water he loved so. 
David filled an extremely imperative role in 
his community. He instilled tangible first-hand 
experience in his advocacy and leadership 
around the needs of Lake Erie and the Great 
Lakes in general. He held several leadership 
positions in advocacy and collective groups 
such as Lake Erie Waterkeeper President as 
well as the Lake Erie Charter Boat Association 
Vice-President. The Lake community as well 
as the health of the water and the future of 
fishing on the Lake have been forever 
changed by his actions and candor in these 
groups. 
David sparked conversations as well as im-
mense political change in his tenacity funneled 
towards the quality of the water of Lake Erie 
as well as curving the harmful algae plaguing 
the water’s fisherman and aquatic life. As a 
Great Lakes Ambassador, he continually set 
the standard for involvement in every level of 
operations in regard to Lake Erie. David was 
renowned for his resolute defense of sustain-
ability coupled with tempered stature of under-
standing and mutual respect. He entered de-
liberations and discussions grounding his 
words in fact and science and opening ears 
and perspective to those around him. He 
stands in a class of his own, a practical, tire-
less, and effective champion of change. 
David’s life and legacy has been enshrined 
in his continued defense of the waters that he 
called home. His time spent in meetings, brief-
ings, conferences, and surely on his boat have 
forever impacted the quality of the great 
waters of Ohio’s most renowned body of fresh 
water. He dedicated his adult life to pursuit of 
public service as well as set an example that 
all future public servants, environmentalists, 
community members, Ohioans, and Americans 
should be inspired to follow. 
David is survived by his beloved wife, Kath 
‘‘Kady’’ Lerch, whom he married in 2007 as 
well as his sister Mary Engle and children;

be pronounced for years to come, both on and

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I was not in

MAYOR JON ARTHUR SIMMONS 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise be-
fore you today to recognize and honor Mayor 
Jon Arthur Simmons of Vienna, Illinois—a re-
markable man who has humbly dedicated his 
life to service, both to Southern Illinois and our 
great nation. 
Jon was born in Goreville Township, Illinois 
on June 15, 1941 to John and Veneta Sim-
mons. He attended Vienna High School, grad-
uating in 1959. Four years later, in 1963, Jon 
was drafted into the United States Army, serv-
ing in Vietnam until being honorably dis-
charged in 1965. In 2019, Jon was honored 
with the opportunity to travel to Washington, 
DC as part of the Southern Illinois Honor 
Flight. Jon recalls the experience and the wel-
come home celebration as humbling, a drastic 
contrast to his experience coming home from 
Vietnam where the soldiers were not wel-
comed and treated unkindly. 
Jon became an auctioneer in 1974 which 
has sent him all over Southern Illinois. His slo-
gan states, ‘‘Auction means action, and we 
guarantee satisfaction’’. The people with 
whom he has interacted throughout the years 
would agree. Furthermore, Jon has dem-
onstrated this motto in his local community, al-
ways being a reliable helping hand to whoever 
is in need. For the last 12 years, Jon has 
served as the Mayor of Vienna, Illinois and 
has spent his career working to progress the 
city he loves. 
At the end of 2020, Jon will retire from 
auctioneering after 46 years and serving as 
Mayor of Vienna after 12 years. Diabetes, a 
heart attack, and cancer of the bladder has 
impacted Jon’s health, a consequence of his 
exposure to agent orange while serving our 
country. 
Madam Speaker, Jon Simmons has proven 
to be an asset to his family, community, and 
country. I want to thank Mayor Simmons for 
his service throughout the years and wish him 
well in his retirement. 
RECOGNIZING MAYOR MARION 
GRAYSON 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’m honored to celebrate and recognize the 
extraordinary work of Belton, TX Mayor Marion 
Grayson. After seven years of extraordinary 
work to her beloved city, Mayor Grayson re-
tired on November 10, 2020. Her commitment 
to public service represents Texas values at 
their best. 
Not only was Marion the first female Mayor 
of Belton, but under her steady and forward- 
looking leadership, Belton has seen expo-
nential changes that have improved the quality 
of life for all and put the city on the track for 
continued growth in the future. Mayor Gray-
son’s work with Belton’s parks and recreation 
including the Nolan Creek project and the res-
toration of beloved public infrastructure dem-
onstrates that she is truly for the people and 
improving the lives of those around her. Not 
only did she enhance the roads of Belton, but 
she also worked to improve everything from 
water quality to performing arts education. 
In her wake, Mayor Grayson leaves behind 
a city, civic organizations, and elected officials 
all better off due to her involvement. She has 
brought her tremendous work ethic and com-
mitment to excellence to every challenge she 
has encountered. It is officials like her that 
make the City of Belton the welcoming, suc-
cessful city that it is. I salute her leadership, 
congratulate her on her retirement, and wish 
Mayor Marion Grayson nothing but the best in 
the years to come.

OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Cynthia Wilbanks as she celebrates her retire-
ment. We are proud to recognize her many 
years of distinguished service with the Univer-
sity of Michigan and the profound impact she 
has left on our community. 
In September 1998, Cynthia Wilbanks was 
appointed to Vice President of Government 
Relations at the University of Michigan. In this 
capacity, Wilbanks has directed U-M’s govern-
ment relation efforts at the local, state, and 
federal level and has been tirelessly advocate 
for the university’s students, faculty, and staff. 
Wilbanks has also held other notable leader-
ship positions at U-M. She has served on the 
Bentley Historical Library Executive Com-
mittee, the Bicentennial Planning Committee, 
the Ginsberg Center Board, the Honorary De-
gree Committee, the Michigan in Washington 
Program Faculty Advisory Committee, and the 
Residency Appeals Committee. In addition, 
she served as Interim Vice President for Com-
munications in 2007 and Interim Vice Presi-
dent for Development from 2002 to 2003. 
Cynthia Wilbanks has decades of public 
service experience. She previously served as 
district director and Washtenaw County field 
representative for U.S. Rep. Carl Pursell and 
also served as a staff assistant for U.S. Rep. 
Marvin Esch. Wilbanks’s extensive knowledge 
of the legislative process augmented her ef-
fectiveness as VP of Government Relations 
and enabled U-M to better meet its legislative 
priorities. In addition, Wilbanks has been an 
active member of several community and civic 
organizations. Before joining U-M, Wilbanks 
was the president of Michigan’s Children. In 
addition, she has served on the board of di-
rectors for Ann Arbor SPARK, the Riverside 
Arts Center Foundation, the Bank of Ann 
Arbor, and the Center for Michigan, and has 
been involved in leadership roles with the Ann 
Arbor Hands-On Museum and Glacier Hills

a host of organizations. She was named one 
of the 100 most influential women in Metro 
Detroit by Crain’s Detroit Business, has been 
a recipient of the Spirit Award, and received a 
Women of Distinction Award from the Girl 
Scouts of the Huron Valley Council, to name 
only a few. 
Throughout her career, Wilbanks has been 
recognized as a dedicated and compassionate 
leader who strives to effect lasting change. 
She has been a strong voice for the University 
of Michigan, expanding the breadth of the in-
stitution and the opportunities it can extend to 
students and surrounding communities. She 
used her knowledge, expertise. and authority 
to make a difference and positively impact the 
lives of countless Michiganders. Without a 
doubt, Wilbanks’s impact will forever endure, 
and we are all grateful for the remarkable 
strides she made. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the retirement of Cynthia 
Wilbanks from the University of Michigan. I am 
proud to honor her work, accomplishments, 
and significant community impact. We thank 
her for her outstanding leadership and wish 
her the best of luck in her future endeavors.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
JAMES JENSEN 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the life and career of James 
D. Jensen—a lawyer, assistant U.S. attorney, 
and a judge who resided for nearly two dec-
ades in our court systems. 
Born in Denver, OH, Judge Jensen built an 
educational career as well as a professional 
career out of Ohio institutions. Graduating 
from Buchtel High School he pursued his 
bachelors at Wittenberg University then his 
law degree at the University of Toledo, where 
he later taught as a professor of law inspiring 
a new generation of public servants. 
Jensen’s career found its beginning in pri-
vate practice and soon transformed into a 
public endeavor as an assistant U.S. attorney 
in Toledo, and in this position was appointed 
to senior litigation counsel. He then served a 
year at the Department of Justice as the as-
sistant director for the attorney general Advo-
cacy Institute, teaching courses at the institute

and at the FBI. After signing onto a firm for a 
span of his career he was appointed to a 
Common Pleas Bench in 1995 which pro-
pelled him to his eventual election onto the 
Ohio 6th District Court of Appeals Bench in 
2012 where he ended his career honorably. 
His professional career was studded with 
honor and recognition of his valor and kind 
disposition. Just last month Judge Jensen was 
honored with the 2020 Thomas J. Moyer 
Award for Judicial Excellence, a high regard 
and an honor well deserved. 
Judge Jensen exemplified passion in his 
legal tenure and is remembered by his peers 
as an authority on law like no other. He is re-
membered to have coined the phrase, ‘‘I’d 
rather be right than affirmed’’. These worded, 
often delivered in passing, reflect his sharp-
ened deliberate demeanor on the courts and 
in his life. 
Jensen’s humility and joy in life were mani-
fested with every court ruling, peer interaction, 
and opportunity to advocate for justice. He 
was commended for his quiet and intentional 
command of the court room, in delivering jus-
tice with a temperament that was even, con-
sistent, and memorable. 
Judge Jensen is survived by a loving family 
that continues his legacy of kindness and de-
termined intelligence. His children, Tracy, 
Tammy, Tim, Dean, and Tyler look forward 
having a path of educational and professional 
achievement paved by their father. 
Judge James Jensen’s impact on the To-
ledo community as well our legal system as 
whole is nothing less than immeasurable. His 
memory and his stature will be remembered 
all, and especially those lucky enough to call 
him friend.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF JULIE 
PIERCE 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of an esteemed 
leader in Contra Costa County, Julie Pierce. 
Julie began her career as a public servant 
in 1987 when she was appointed to the City 
of Clayton Planning Commission. In 1992, 
Julie was elected to the Clayton City Council, 
where she has served ever since, including in 
the roles of Mayor and Vice Mayor. During her 
tenure on the Council, Julie has worked to im-
prove the lives of current and future residents 
of Clayton by protecting open spaces, advo-
cating for residential and business planning 
and development, and fostering a sense of 
community. 
In addition to her work on the Council, Julie 
has been an active member of regional orga-
nizations that support the larger Bay Area, in-
cluding the Association of Bay Area Govern-
ments (ABAG), where has previously served 
as both President and Vice President. Julie’s 
work has been instrumental in advancing ini-
tiatives that focus on the growth of the Bay 
Area, including closing the wage gap. She has 
also been a delegate of the California Council 
of Governments, Commissioner of the Contra 
Costa Transportation Authority, and Commis-
sioner of the Transportation Partnership and 
Cooperation. Furthermore, Julie was an inte-
gral part of the Shaping Our Future initiative, 
which addressed housing, jobs, and transpor-
tation in Contra Costa County. 
Julie Pierce is known by her colleagues as 
a dedicated and effective leader and I have 
enjoyed our many years of working together. 
Please join me in thanking Julie for her serv-
ice to our County and wishing her the best in 
her retirement.

HONORING BISHOP ARTHUR 
JOSEPH SERRATELLI 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bishop Arthur J. Serratelli 
for his commitment to spread the word of God 
in the City of Paterson and beyond. May we 
all admire his relationship with God and re-
member his spiritual leadership as he retires 
from the Diocese of Paterson. Born in Newark, 
New Jersey on April 18, 1944, to Pio Serratelli 
and Eva Fasolino, Bishop Serratelli is a native 
son of our great State of New Jersey, and I 
am proud of his service to the people of the 
Ninth Congressional District. 
A learned man with many accomplishment 
as an academic, Bishop Serratelli is the recipi-
ent of a undergraduate degree from Seton 
Hall University in 1965, a Licentiate in Sacred 
Theology from the Gregorian University in 
1969, a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture from the 
Biblical Institute in 1976, and a doctorate in 
Sacred Theology from the Gregorian Univer-
sity in 1977. 
Ordained to the priesthood on December 
20, 1968 in St. Peter’s Basilica by Bishop 
Francis Reh, Bishop Serratelli would start his 
journey as a theologian serving one year as 
parochial vicar at St. Anthony Parish in Belle-
ville. He would also expand further and teach 
Systematic Theology at Immaculate Concep-
tion Seminary for two years before returning to 
Rome to complete his education. 
Prior to his appointment on July 6, 2004 to 
the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in 
Paterson, 
Arthur 
Serratelli 
was 
Auxiliary 
Bishop of Newark, Regional Bishop for Essex 
County, and Vicar General for the Apostolates. 
Bishop Serratelli has also assumed various 
leadership roles throughout our community. 
Most recently, Bishop Serratelli was Chairman 
of the International Committee on English in 
the Liturgy and co-chair of the Vatican’s Inter-
national Dialogue with the Baptist World Alli-
ance. Additionally, Arthur was also a member 
of the Congregation for Divine Worship and 
the Discipline of the Sacraments with the Vati-
can. Arthur is also currently on the Board of 
Directors for the Catholic Relief Services, 
Board of Trustees at Assumption College for 
Sisters and on the Board of Regents and 
Board of Trustees with Seton Hall University. 
Bishop Serratelli has been with the City of 
Paterson for nearly sixteen years providing the 
people of my district with his exemplary reli-
gious service. Our churches are among the 
most important social institutions in our nation, 
offering spiritual guidance, solace and com-
munal bonding to people across a wide spec-
trum of our land. An active church can be the 
glue that binds a community together, it can 
help to steer youth in the right direction, and 
it can offer hope where there is trouble. I am 
so grateful for Bishop Arthur Serratelli’s stew-
ardship and care for the Silk City. 
The job of a United States Congressman in-
volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to working with and recognizing the 
efforts of individuals like Bishop Arthur J. 
Serratelli. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, friends, family, and the residents of 
New Jersey in recognizing Bishop Arthur J. 
Serratelli for his outstanding work, as we cele-
brate his years of distinguished service to the 
people of the Ninth Congressional District.

IN HONOR OF ROBERT H. 
WASHBURN 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Robert H. Washburn 
of Huntingdon County for his service in the 
United States Army. Robert is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for his serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered 
the call to serve and fight for us—at a great 
cost. Truly, our veterans are the best of Amer-
ica. 
In Congress, it is my privilege—and my re-
sponsibility—to stand up for those who have 
served our country in uniform, as well as to 
recognize these brave Americans. As a nation, 
we are indebted to them. On behalf of the 
13th Congressional District, I thank Robert for 
his service to our nation and our community.
