DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, You breathed life into 
us at creation, making humanity a lit-
tle lower than the angels, crowning us 
with glory and honor, putting every-
thing under our feet. What a gift. 
Keep us ever mindful of the responsi-
bility that comes with that endow-
ment: that You desire that each and all 
would flourish, that everyone would be 
able to live into the privilege of becom-
ing the people You designed us to be. 
As You did in the beginning, send 
Your spirit and bring order over the 
chaotic waters of disputes and debate 
that surround us. 
Shed Your light on the darkness of 
alienation and division and divide the 
tempestuous 
argument 
from 
the 
unique, meaningful, and constructive 
dialogue. 
Remind us that You have created us 
in Your image, and this is what we 
should see reflected in the lives of the 
other. Whether we like them or not, 
whether we vote as they do or remain 
adamantly opposed, they, too, are Your 
beloved children. 
And as we labor in this place, we 
pray that You look over our steward-
ship of Your gifts and call it good. 
In the strength of Your divine name 
we pray. 
Amen.

ant to section 5(a)(1)(A) of House Reso-

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. GIMENEZ led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
SHORING UP DEMOCRACY 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act. 
The limits of our democracy have 
been tested like never before, espe-
cially in the last election, where we 
saw baseless lawsuits, misinformation, 
attempts to suppress legal votes, a re-
fusal by a sitting President to transfer 
power peacefully that resulted in an at-
tempted insurrection aimed solely to 
block the will of the people. 
While 
our 
system 
ultimately 
worked—thanks to patriotic State and 
local officials and volunteers across 
the country—its limitations were laid 
bare, for us to fix. 
H.R. 1 would shore up our democracy 
and the people’s faith in its power. 
I am pleased this bill incorporates 
two of my bills. The first requires all 
States to offer same-day registration. 
The 
second 
ends 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering by requiring States to adopt 
citizen redistricting commissions. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting ‘‘yes’’ for this transformational 
bill that fights special interests, takes 
money out of politics, and puts power 
back in the hands of the American peo-
ple. 
f 
REMEMBERING ELEANOR ‘‘SANDY’’ 
TORREY WEST 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor Mrs. Eleanor 
‘‘Sandy’’ Torrey West, who passed 
away on January 17 at the age of 108. 
Mrs. West was known as a woman 
who embodied the spirit of Ossabaw Is-
land, which is the third largest of Geor-
gia’s barrier islands, just south of Sa-
vannah. 
She established the Ossabaw Island 
Project in the 1960s and the Genesis 
Project in the 1970s as ways to allow 
students, artists, writers, scientists, 
ecologists, philosophers, and other in-
tellectuals and creative thinkers to re-
connect with the natural world and 
with each other. 
In the late 1970s, Mrs. West spear-
headed her family’s effort to ensure 
that Ossabaw Island would remain pre-
served and protected. 
She was the champion of Ossabaw, 
and her enthusiastic, joyful spirit 
shined in everything she did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1020 
March 3, 2021 
Throughout Mrs. West’s long, pros-
perous life, she inspired countless indi-
viduals. 
I am so thankful for her many con-
tributions to Georgia’s First District, 
and I know her legacy will continue for 
years to come. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her during this most difficult time. 
f 
CONSTRUCTIVELY CHANGING THE 
CULTURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, to help con-
structively change the culture of law 
enforcement and strengthen the trust 
between police and the communities 
they serve. 
Last summer, communities across 
the Nation convulsed with raw emotion 
after George Floyd was brutally mur-
dered by a police officer. 
His death may have been the spark, 
but the true force motivating these 
protests was the systemic racism that 
harms Black Americans every day. 
Last June, one month after his death, 
this House passed the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, only to see it 
stall in the Senate. 
We will vote again on the bill this 
week. 
George 
Floyd, 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Ahmaud 
Arbery, 
these people and 
countless others should still be alive 
today. 
We can’t bring them and the others 
back, but we can honor their memory 
and, in so doing, strengthen our com-
munities and our Nation. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
f 
WE NEED MEANINGFUL, 
BIPARTISAN ELECTION REFORM 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to H.R. 1. 
Free, fair, and transparent elections 
are the cornerstone of our democracy. 
Americans must be able to trust in the 
integrity of our election processes. 
This bill, however, federalizes elec-
tions and takes control of elections 
from State and local governments. 
It will grant the Federal Government 
unprecedented power over voting proc-
esses and pave the way for rampant 
fraud, abuse, and litigation. 
This legislation nullifies voter I.D. 
laws, allows convicted felons to vote, 
legalizes ballot harvesting, and ex-
pands mail-in voting. 
It even allows, for the first time ever, 
taxpayer 
funding 
of 
Federal 
cam-
paigns, with a 6-to-1 government, tax-
payer-funded match in most cases. 
H.R. 1 is a cynical and partisan meas-
ure that will erode faith in our democ-
racy and not restore it. 
Every citizen should be confident 
that every legal vote counts. Congress 
has a duty to deliver election reform 
that honors the will of the people and 
the Constitution. 
We need meaningful, bipartisan elec-
tion reform, and I urge my colleagues 
to oppose H.R. 1. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN 
DONALD LAMBERT, JR. 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here to honor the life of Captain 
Donald Lambert, Jr. 
Last weekend, the Henrico County 
Police Department lost one of its own. 
Captain 
Lambert 
served 
in 
the 
Henrico Police Department for nearly 
34 years, and his fellow officers remem-
ber him as a true friend, mentor, and 
leader. 
I had the privilege of getting to know 
Captain Lambert through his work as 
the head of the Henrico Special Oper-
ations Group. Captain Lambert’s secu-
rity expertise helped keep me, as well 
as my predecessors, Congressmen Brat 
and Cantor, and our staffs, out of 
harm’s way, and I am forever grateful 
for his dedication to his work. 
Captain Lambert was a pillar of our 
central Virginia community. He was a 
dedicated member of the Henrico Po-
lice Department, but he will be remem-
bered as a gifted musician, a beloved 
Sunday school teacher, and a man who 
demonstrated true compassion for oth-
ers. 
Captain Lambert’s decades of selfless 
service to the community of Henrico 
and the Commonwealth of Virginia will 
never be forgotten. 
Our hearts are with his family, 
friends, and fellow men and women of 
the Henrico County Police Department 
as they honor his life. 
f 
A TRAVESTY FOR AMERICANS 
(Mr. GIMENEZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 1. 
Americans love election season. They 
absolutely love the endless political 
ads, having their phones blown up by 
political calls and texts, and having 
their email inboxes littered with solici-
tations from want-to-be politicians. My 
phone keeps ringing off the hook from 
all of my constituents just pleading for 
Congress to use their dollars to fund 
more campaign ads. 
This is the fantasy world that gov-
ernment bureaucrats and career politi-
cians who want a Federal takeover of 
our elections live in. They want to 
take Americans’ money and give it to 
campaigns at a 6-to-1 ratio, effectively 
forcing you to finance political cam-
paigns you don’t support. 
H.R. 1, the so-called For the People 
Act, weaponizes the FEC into a par-
tisan commission and throws out com-
monsense voter I.D. laws, just to name 
a few. As one of the only Members of 
Congress who has actually had to im-
plement election protocols, I speak on 
authority when it comes to our elec-
tions. This bill is a travesty for all 
Americans. 
f 
REBUILDING OUR CREDIBILITY ON 
THE WORLD STAGE 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
1, the For the People Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I was in this very 
Chamber on January 6 when our de-
mocracy was attacked. 
In the days following, I received texts 
and calls from friends and former col-
leagues around the world, who were 
working on improving democracy in 
places like Burma and Hungary, who 
were devastated about what they were 
seeing and how it would impact their 
ability to make progress around the 
world. 
Passing H.R. 1, rebuilding trust in 
our democracy, is imperative for our 
national security. 
Since January 6, countries have ques-
tioned whether they need to listen to 
America’s calls to defend human rights 
or abide by the results of free and fair 
elections. 
Our allies and partners have ques-
tioned if they should continue fol-
lowing our lead when it seems like 
other countries’ autocratic systems are 
more capable of addressing crises. 
We need to rebuild our credibility on 
the world stage. 
Countries needn’t be defined by their 
darkest days, but rather by how they 
overcome them. 
The world was watching on January 
6, and it is watching again today. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1. 
f 
RECKLESS SWAMP FUELS FRAUD 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, in an era of fake news, it is 
refreshing to find editorialist Jerry 
Bellune, editor of the Lexington Coun-
ty Chronicle, expose the tragic fraud 
being perpetrated on taxpayers: 
The Washington Swamp set up criminals 
to steal billions of dollars through fraud. 
In attempts to shovel money to the rest of 
us, Congress has created an opportunity for 
criminal fraud. 
Their real victims are us, the American 
taxpayers, and our great-grandchildren who 
will be paying for this folly for generations 
to come. 
The reality is that those who created the 
CARES Act set us up for up to $100 billion in 
fraud. The Labor Department inspector gen-
eral estimates $63 billion in tax dollars were 
stolen.

NEED FOR RENTAL RELIEF 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of New York’s renters and the far- 
too-many families who are struggling 
as a result of the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
Hardworking New Yorkers who have 
lost their jobs and closed their busi-
nesses, through no fault of their own, 
now are struggling, too, to pay their 
rent. 
The American Rescue Plan would 
provide more than $20 billion in total 
for emergency rental and utility assist-
ance. This is in addition to the $25 bil-
lion provided in the December package. 
The House took bold action last week 
by passing the American Rescue Plan, 
and I call on the Senate to pass it im-
mediately and get it to the President’s 
desk. 
This is the lifeline our families and 
businesses so desperately need. Hope 
and health are on the way.

SACRIFICING ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, just 
weeks into this administration, and 
after endless promises of unity, the 
President has issued over 40 radical ex-
ecutive orders, ranging from rejoining 
a failed climate pact to taking steps to 
dismantle the Nation’s border security. 
Governing via executive order, the 
administration 
has 
unilaterally 
launched a coordinated assault on 
American energy and a war on agri-
culture. 
By revoking the Keystone XL pipe-
line project, the administration sent 
more than 10,000 skilled workers to the 
unemployment 
line, 
disrupted 
our 
safest and most efficient form of en-
ergy transportation, and increased the 
cost of transporting grain for farmers 
and agribusinesses. 
The President also issued extremist 
moratoriums on new oil and gas leas-
ing and drilling on Federal lands, 
which only serves to increase American 
reliance on foreign energy, eliminate 
good-paying jobs, further stifle eco-
nomic growth, and drive up the cost of 
fuel and electricity for every Amer-
ican. 
This backward agenda is sacrificing 
the energy independence achievements 
made by President Trump and Repub-
licans these past 4 years. Sadly, the 
Biden Democrat Party energy policy is 
putting America last. 
f 
STOP TREATING MENTAL ILLNESS 
LIKE A CRIME 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, equality 
and justice are core values of this 
country, yet for Americans with men-
tal illness, the risk of being killed 
when approached by law enforcement is 
16 times higher. An estimated one in 
four fatal police encounters ends the 
life of an individual with mental ill-
ness. 
We are not fulfilling the promise of 
equality and justice for Americans 
with mental illnesses and disabilities. 
That is why I introduced the Mental 
Health Justice Act, which would create 
specialized mental health first re-
sponder units. If someone is experi-
encing a mental health crisis, they are 
better served by a trained mental 
health professional, not a police offi-
cer. 
Mental illness is not a crime, and we 
have to stop treating it like one. Get-
ting the right help to individuals with 
mental illnesses prevents them from 
getting tangled up in a system that 
isn’t built to serve their needs. 
The 
Mental 
Health 
Justice 
Act 
makes our communities healthier and 
safer, more equal, and more just. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF NICK 
WINUM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Stanley Police Offi-
cer Nick Winum, who was tragically 
killed in the line of duty this weekend. 
Originally a successful tomato farm-
er on the Eastern Shore, Officer Winum 
followed his calling to serve others and 
joined the Virginia State Police. After 
working for more than a decade as a 
State 
trooper, 
Officer 
Winum 
transitioned into the Stanley Police 
Department in 2016, where he served 
until his passing. 
For the last 15 years of his life, he 
put the well-being of his neighbors 
above his own, and our community is 
forever grateful for the sacrifice he 
made while keeping our streets safe. 
Officer Winum is survived by the love 
of his life, his wife, Cara; his children, 
Jedediah, Aubrey, Jackson, and Nicki; 
his granddaughter, Willa; as well as his 
parents, siblings, and 24 nieces and 
nephews. 
He is remembered as a man of honor 
and principle who loved the Lord, his 
family, and his country. 
To honor this patriot, those who 
knew him will continue to carry on his 
legacy of kindness, compassion, and 
service to others. I join his law enforce-
ment colleagues in mourning his pass-
ing and extend my deepest condolences 
to his family.

DARK MONEY INTERESTS 
SQUEALING LOUDLY 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, this 
week we will be passing H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act, and the dark money in-
terests are squealing loudly about it 
right now. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, re-
quires exposure of the identities of the 
people and companies that are the dark 
money that contribute hundreds of 
millions of dollars toward American 
elections, including Federal elections, 
in this country—people and companies 
that don’t have to reveal who they are, 
what they are about, what profits they 
are trying to maximize, or even if they 
are from the United States of America. 
They don’t have to reveal any of that. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, is to 
restore democracy to this country, to 
restore pure democracy so that we 
know who is paying for these elections. 
The dark money interests are squeal-
ing about it. They are squealing like 
stuck pigs. Let’s pass H.R. 1.

REMEMBERING PEGGY SADLER 
(Mr. GARCI´A of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of my dear friend, Peggy 
Sadler, who is now with the Lord. 
Peggy and her husband, David, met 
while attending the University of Cali-
fornia-Santa Barbara. In the mid-1960s, 
they moved to the beautiful Simi Val-
ley. David passed away last year as 
well, so they are now reunited in Heav-
en. 
Peggy was the mother of two chil-
dren, Robert and Leslie. She was a tire-
less public servant for over 40 years, 
supporting local public leaders and vol-
unteering throughout the community. 
Peggy spent her retirement helping 
raise her grandchildren and great- 
grandchildren, serving as a docent at 
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li-
brary and Museum, and serving her 
community as a volunteer at her local 
church. 
I am grateful for the friendship that 
Peggy and I shared. The city of Simi 
Valley is a better place because of 
Peggy Sadler. May we all pray for her 
family, and may God bless Ms. Peggy 
Sadler.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1022 
March 3, 2021 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act. 
As a former voting rights attorney, I 
have seen firsthand the devastation on 
the faces of Americans when they are 
denied their ability to make their 
voice heard in our elections because 
they missed an arbitrary deadline or 
have shown up to their old polling 
place. It is heartbreaking, and it is not 
who we are as a nation. 
With today’s vote on the For the 
People Act, we, as a Congress, have an 
opportunity to affirmatively expand 
access to voting. This bill would do so 
by allowing for automatic and same- 
day voter registration and establishing 
a national early voting period, while 
also enacting key reforms that will 
make our elections more secure and 
that will ensure Americans and only 
Americans take part in them. 
I am proud that two bills that I in-
troduced, the Know Your Polling Place 
Act and the Shell Company Abuse Act, 
which would make our democracy more 
accessible and more secure, are in-
cluded in today’s bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
return political power to everyday 
Americans and to vote for this legisla-
tion. 
f 
REQUIRING VOTER ID STRENGTH-
ENS ELECTION INTEGRITY 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my strong opposition 
to H.R. 1 because it violates the U.S. 
Constitution. It usurps the rights of 
States to establish and administer 
their own elections. 
As we speak, Georgia lawmakers are 
working to make smart and targeted 
reforms to Georgia’s election laws, like 
picture identification for absentee vot-
ing. Such reforms are critically impor-
tant. 
H.R. 1 would not only nullify Georgia 
lawmakers’ efforts, but it would also 
mandate that all States provide no-ex-
cuse absentee voting with absolutely 
zero safeguards. 
I read the bill to see what I needed to 
do to obtain and cast an absentee bal-
lot under H.R. 1. I was shocked to learn 
I needed nothing: no witness signature, 
no picture identification. Nothing is re-
quired. 
Just tell that to TSA the next time 
you try to get on an airplane, or to 
your local gun dealer when you try to 
buy a gun. In fact, if we are going to 
eliminate a valid government-issued 
photo ID for constitutional voting 
rights, then let’s eliminate the need for 
photo ID to exercise your Second 
Amendment too. 
The hypocrisy by the liberal left to 
eliminate voter ID is stunning. Trust 
starts by States taking steps to verify 
that all votes are legal and cast by eli-
gible voters. That is why we must 
verify citizenship and require picture 
identification. 
I commend our Georgia lawmakers 
for strengthening the integrity of our 
Georgia elections, and I am proud to 
support those efforts by voting ‘‘no’’ on 
the Federal takeover of elections. 
f 
PUTTING THE FIX IN FUTURE 
ELECTIONS 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, what 
should be named the for the politicians 
act. There is nothing in this bill that is 
for the people. 
I could spend hours highlighting the 
damaging aspects of this bill, but let’s 
start with eliminating voter ID. Ameri-
cans need an ID to drive, to get mar-
ried, to get on an airplane, even to buy 
cold medicine, but to take part in the 
foundational component of our Repub-
lic? Apparently, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle think elimi-
nating any proof of who you are is for 
the people. It is not. It is for the politi-
cians. 
Then we have taxpayer-funded cam-
paigns. H.R. 1 would implement a 6-to- 
1 match for small-donor contributions 
up to $200 in a congressional or Presi-
dential campaign. The people of Illi-
nois’ 15th District shouldn’t be forced 
to fund the campaigns of people they 
vehemently disagree with. 
The November election made it read-
ily apparent that our election system 
needs fixing. This bill just puts the fix 
in future elections.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
JOSEPH CORR 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor the life and memory of 
New Hartford, New York Police Officer 
Joseph Corr. Fifteen years ago last 
month, Officer Corr was shot and killed 
in the line of duty while in pursuit of 
a robbery suspect. 
Joe Corr, who was born and raised in 
my hometown of New Hartford, New 
York, 
was 
a 
dedicated 
father 
to 
Kaitlyn, a loving husband to Tracie, 
and a hero who served and protected 
our community with honor. 
Today, the Officer Joseph D. Corr 
Foundation proudly honors Joe’s mem-
ory and gives back to his fellow mem-
bers in blue by supporting other fami-
lies who have experienced similar trag-
edies. His parents, Dave and Kathleen, 
continue to provide their love and 
counsel to those families as well. 
Officer Corr’s death is a sad reminder 
of the dangers our brave men and 
women face each day in the line of 
duty. These heroes deserve our unwav-
ering respect for the sacrifices that 
they make each and every day to keep 
our communities safe. 
USING TAX DOLLARS TO FUND 
CAMPAIGNS IS WRONG 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, 
H.R. 1 shamefully allows candidates for 
Congress to use tax dollars to fund 
campaigns with a $6 match for every $1 
raised. Any normal person would call 
this a form of embezzlement. 
Tax dollars are supposed to be used 
to maintain our transportation infra-
structure, fund our schools, and keep 
the public safe, not to fund campaigns. 
As a representative from New York 
City, which has public financing of 
campaigns, and as a former candidate 
for mayor, I can tell you that it does 
nothing to take big money out of poli-
tics, and it does nothing to level the 
playing field. Bill de Blasio still re-
ceived big donations bundled by lobby-
ists and special interests, and I would 
have still been outspent 4 to 1 with or 
without matching funds. 
Using taxpayer money to fund polit-
ical campaigns is not only wrong; it is 
an abuse of taxpayers and has led to 
more corruption. Multiple candidates 
and elected officials in New York City 
were convicted for exploiting the sys-
tem and developing schemes to ille-
gally pad their campaigns with tax-
payer money. 
Additionally, at a time when so 
many Americans question the integrity 
of our election system and are looking 
for safeguards to protect their vote, 
this bill bans States from having voter 
ID and implements same-day voter reg-
istration, which does not give election 
boards the proper time to ensure indi-
viduals’ eligibility and further erodes 
the public trust. 
Instead of this ridiculous bill, we 
should be adopting the Save Democ-
racy Act and restoring the trust and 
integrity of our election system.

RADICAL PATH OF DEMOCRATS 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to inform Democrats 
that the radical path you are taking 
will cause you to lose in 2022. 
The American people are shocked at 
what 
you 
are 
doing 
and 
running 
through this House of Representatives. 
Passing a bill of $1.9 trillion that 
spends less than 9 percent on COVID 
relief is shameful. Passing the inequal-
ity act, which destroys women’s rights, 
religious freedoms; puts men in our lit-
tle girls’ bathrooms, locker rooms, and 
on sports teams is unforgivable. 
Trying to pass what I call the Demo-
crats’ hate police bill, H.R. 1280—which 
puts police on Biden’s hit list and al-
lows police to be targets, also gets rid 
of qualified immunity, opening them 
up to be sued every time a criminal is 
offended and gets their feelings hurt—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1024 
March 3, 2021 
Strike section 4208. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Arizona. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to offer 
an amendment to remove section 4208 
from H.R. 1. 
Section 4208 is a dangerous provision 
of this bill that will put people’s pri-
vate information on display and put 
their personal security at risk. 
This section aims to forbid anony-
mous speech. Throughout American 
history, anonymous speech about polit-
ical matters has played a vital role. 
From the Federalist Papers, to those 
who supported the civil rights move-
ment of the 1950s and 1960s, many in 
history had very legitimate fears of 
having their identities uncovered and 
relied on anonymous speech to show 
their support for certain policies and 
initiatives. 
Section 4208 removes the protection 
of anonymous speech forever. By re-
quiring public reporting of the private 
information of individuals, partner-
ships, associations, and any group of 
people who spend $500 or more on polit-
ical advertising—which is a very broad 
definition in this bill—we put individ-
uals at risk. 
Furthermore, we drastically limit 
free speech and destroy the First 
Amendment. Notably, the courts have 
already begun to warn against the con-
stitutionality of similar provisions in 
State law. We cannot allow this to 
stand. Not only will it cause a security 
problem for these individuals but, as 
we have seen, people could lose their 
jobs, be shamed, or even worse. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Arizona 
for yielding, and I am proud to support 
her amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1, the so-called For the 
People Act a/k/a the for the politicians 
act. Supporters of this bill claim that 
it is the fix needed for the problems 
within our Nation’s electoral system, 
but in reality this bill is a power grab 
that will blur the lines between official 
and campaign resources and leave tax-
payers footing the bill. 
It is shameful that this body is even 
considering this legislation that forces 
hardworking Americans amid an un-
precedented crisis to give politicians 
money. H.R. 1 would funnel millions of 
taxpayer dollars into the campaign ac-
counts of politicians through voucher 
and funding match programs. This bill 
will allow 16-year-olds to vote, give $25 
vouchers to individuals to donate to 
the candidate of their choice, redefines 
free speech, triggers universal mail-in 
ballots, creates an election czar, strips 
voter ID requirements, and so much 
more. 
This bill jeopardizes the future of 
Americans’ freedom of speech with new 
requirements for public disclosure of 
support of political campaigns and can-
didates. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot claim to be 
protecting the rights and freedoms en-
shrined in our Constitution when this, 
the For the People Act—more aptly 
named the for the politicians act—is 
under consideration. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentlewoman’s amend-
ment, and I will be supporting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1, the underlying bill, the 
‘‘destroy election integrity and cen-
tralize all power in Washington, D.C., 
act’’ that Democrats are, once again, 
pushing because they never have and 
never will believe in the rights of our 
States and the limited power of Fed-
eral Government. 
Some of my colleagues who took 
every opportunity to emphasize that 
democracy was on the ballot in this 
past election have returned to Congress 
eager to change election laws in their 
favor. 
H.R. 1 is wholly about control—con-
trol of free speech and control of how 
elections are conducted. And when 
they exercise this control, their pur-
pose is to crush opposing views, be-
cause opposing views will not be toler-
ated when there are Democrat majori-
ties at stake. 
America’s strength lies in its free 
speech and decentralized elections, and 
we must continue to make our election 
system more resilient to natural chal-
lenges and foreign actors. H.R. 1 fails 
to do this on all fronts. 
Mr. Speaker, I was elected by the 
people of the 24th District of Texas to 
stand up for freedom, the rule of law, 
and limited government. I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this vile new 
form of tyranny in H.R. 1. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I dis-
agree with this amendment. It would 
strike section 4208 of H.R. 1 which re-
quires 
online 
platforms 
to 
retain 
records of certain online political ad-
vertisements. 
According 
to 
Forbes 
magazine, political advertisers spent 
$1.6 billion online in the 2020 election— 
almost 10 times what they spent in 
2012. 
At a time when Americans are in-
creasingly bombarded with political 
ads online, striking this provision is 
not useful and would harm the efforts 
of this bill to provide increased trans-
parency in political advertising. Fun-
damentally, 
Americans 
deserve 
to 
know who is paying for online political 
ads to ensure that they are informed 
voters. 
Digital advertising can also have a 
far greater reach than broadcast adver-
tising. Online political ads are rel-
atively inexpensive to produce and can 
be disseminated instantly to vast audi-
ences across great distances without 
regard to geographic boundaries. It is 
time for our disclosure and disclaimer 
laws and regulations to be updated to 
reflect how campaigns are run in the 
21st century and how to keep pace with 
changing technology. 
The online platform records require-
ments in this section are key to the 
Honest Ads Act, which is a part of H.R. 
1, designed to improve transparency in 
political advertising. By requiring on-
line platforms to retain copies of polit-
ical ads, everyday Americans at home 
will be able to see who is paying for 
what. These requirements are narrowly 
drawn and only apply to online plat-
forms with over 50 million monthly 
unique visitors and to advertisers who 
run over $500 a year in political adver-
tisements. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the measure and protect 
this important reform. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
CLARK). 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, the insurrection on January 6 
had a specific purpose: to overturn our 
election and to violently disenfran-
chise millions of voters. 
The immediate threat to the Capitol 
has been quelled, but our democracy’s 
future is still unclear. Across the coun-
try there are ongoing efforts to sup-
press and limit votes. Dark money 
fuels campaigns without transparency 
and accountability, and partisan gerry-
mandering tilts the playing field. 
A vote for H.R. 1 is a vote for equal-
ity, for transparency, and for returning 
power to the people. 
Mr. Speaker, 56 years ago on March 7, 
John Lewis almost lost his life on the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right to 
vote. He said: ‘‘Your vote is precious, 
almost sacred. It is the most powerful, 
nonviolent tool we have to create a 
more perfect union.’’ 
Let’s strive for that more perfect 
union. Let’s confirm our democracy 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1. 
b 1045 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just note that the late Justice Scalia, 
who was not exactly one of our liberal 
beacons on the Court, said this: ‘‘Re-
quiring people to stand up in public for 
their political acts fosters civic cour-
age, 
without 
which 
democracy 
is 
doomed.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN). 
Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
amendment proposes to knock out the

heart of the Honest Ads Act, so the 
public won’t know who is purchasing 
ads online. That is the exact opposite 
of what we need to be doing. We need 
far greater transparency about who is 
polluting the airwaves and who is pol-
luting the internet with propaganda 
and fake news. We should know who is 
paying for all of that. 
This used to be a very solid bipar-
tisan commitment between Democrats 
and Republicans. Everybody agreed 
there should at least be disclosure of 
campaign spending. 
Now, they not only want to put out 
propaganda online, but they don’t even 
want anybody to know who is paying 
for it. That is the opposite direction 
that we should be moving in America. 
We should be defending everybody’s 
right to vote, everybody’s right to par-
ticipate against all of the schemes to 
undermine voting rights, and we should 
make sure that everybody knows who 
is putting money into the political sys-
tem. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on that amend-
ment. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) for the purpose 
of a colloquy. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, in Florida, we have strong re-
districting standards that were passed 
by a large majority of Florida voters 
and placed in our State constitution. 
I also recognize that strong stand-
ards and criteria are provided for in 
H.R. 1. 
Would the chairperson agree to work-
ing together with the State-adopted re-
districting criteria to ensure H.R. 1 
does not dilute the Florida require-
ments? 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to work with the gentlewoman 
as this bill advances towards enact-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no additional 
speakers, and I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the Lesko amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The amendment was rejected. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
AMENDMENT NO. 37 OFFERED BY MS. PRESSLEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 37 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
9. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 88, after line 8, insert the following: 
SEC. 1055. LOWERING MANDATORY MINIMUM 
VOTING AGE IN FEDERAL ELEC-
TIONS. 
(a) LOWERING VOTING AGE TO 16 YEARS OF 
AGE.—A State may not refuse to permit an 
individual to register to vote or vote in an 
election for Federal office held in the State 
on the grounds of the individual’s age if the 
individual will be at least 16 years of age on 
the date of the election. 
(b) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—This section shall 
apply with respect to elections held in 2022 
or any succeeding year. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
PRESSLEY) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my amendment to H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act. 
H.R. 1 is bold, transformative legisla-
tion, which fights voter suppression, 
promotes access to the ballot, cracks 
down on money in politics, and pro-
vides transparency to the American 
people. 
Passing this bill has never been more 
urgent. We must act to protect and 
preserve our democracy. 
My amendment gets to the heart of 
H.R. 1 and recognizes the contributions 
that young people continue to make to 
our democracy. 
By lowering the Federal voting age 
from 18 to 16 years of age, my amend-
ment would enfranchise young Ameri-
cans to help shape and form the poli-
cies that will set the course for our fu-
ture. 
From police violence, to immigration 
reform, to climate change, to the fu-
ture of work and the minimum wage, 
our young people are organizing, mobi-
lizing, and calling us to action. They 
are at the forefront of social move-
ments and have more than earned in-
clusion in our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, 16- and 17-year-old con-
stituents of mine are supporting their 
families. They are working, not for en-
richment or to build a resume, but be-
cause they have no choice. They are at-
tending school full-time and taking 
care of loved ones in the midst of the 
COVID crisis. 
Young people are contributing both 
to the labor force and their local 
economies by paying taxes, and yet 
they are deprived of the opportunity to 
exercise their right to vote. 
Some have questioned the maturity 
of our youth. I don’t. 
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds today pos-
sess wisdom and maturity defined by 
today’s challenges, hardships, and op-
portunities. 
They deserve and demand a govern-
ment that is accountable to them, a 
government that values their voices, 
and understands the depth and breadth 
of their lived experience. 
They are not a monolith. But they 
are nation-builders, living through a 
global pandemic, confronting racial in-
justice, and rebuilding our democracy. 
Now is the time for us to meet the 
moment and enfranchise 16- and 17- 
year-olds. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
and dear friends, Representatives MENG 
and SCHAKOWSKY, for their leadership 
on this issue and for cosponsoring my 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
first, I want to thank my friend, 
AYANNA PRESSLEY, the wonderful con-
gresswoman 
from 
Massachusetts. 
I 
have had the pleasure of knowing 
AYANNA PRESSLEY well before she was 
even 16, and she was ready to vote as 
soon as that. 
I want to say that all over the coun-
try, and especially in my district, I feel 
we see young people, young activists, 
who are working tirelessly to make 
their voices heard, from battling cli-
mate change, battling gun violence, to 
advocating for racial justice and eco-
nomic equality. 
This is their century, and our na-
tional leadership should be accountable 
to them, to these young people in their 
generation who will be most impacted 
by the existential threats that are 
looming before us today. 
This is a serious proposal. Sixteen- 
year-olds are doing the work of adults, 
and they should be treated with the re-
spect that they deserve and the partici-
pation that they should be able to 
have. 
So I heartily support this amend-
ment and urge my colleagues to con-
sider it carefully and vote for it. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER), my good friend. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, our Na-
tion faces serious challenges, including 
an ongoing pandemic, vaccine distribu-
tion 
hurdles, 
continued 
lockdowns 
from 
out-of-touch 
Governors, 
pro-
longed closures of our schools, and one- 
in-four small businesses face the risk of 
permanent closure. 
At a time when the American people 
are concerned with election integrity, 
a top priority of our Democrat leader-
ship is to federalize election laws, re-
moving the authority of State legisla-
tures expressed in Article I, Section 4 
of the Constitution. 
H.R. 1, the bill before us today, would 
allow for taxpayer-funded campaigns 
through a government match on polit-
ical contributions at a 6-to-1 ratio. So 
a $200 contribution would be matched 
by the taxpayer to the tune of $1,200. 
H.R. 1 would also hinder the rights of 
States to determine their registration 
voting practices, including mandating 
automatic voter registration. 
The suggestion being made by my 
Democrat friends and colleagues that 
opposition to this legislation is some-
how a form of voter suppression is ri-
diculous. I and my colleagues would 
never consider engaging in a course of

action that suppresses a citizen’s le-
gitimate right to vote. 
This is a partisan power grab that 
threatens election integrity. ‘‘One cit-
izen, one vote’’ is my solemn resolve. I 
oppose this amendment and the under-
lying bill. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, let me rise to support the 
Pressley-Meng-Schakowsky 
amend-
ment. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY for bringing this forward and 
to say that she is about the future and 
really about making sure that civic 
participation is really enhanced and 
moved forward by allowing for this 
amendment to come into this bill, H.R. 
1, because this is what it is about. It is 
about our democracy, and she has been 
consistent in terms of inclusion and 
making sure our democracy works. 
Elections are about the future, and 
no one has more at stake in that future 
than our youth. By age 16, we trust our 
young people with a host of important 
decisions and responsibilities. It is the 
moment when lifelong habits are built 
and when ideas about the world become 
to be fixed. Evidence has shown that 
when people start voting younger, they 
are more likely to exercise their right 
to vote as they grow older. 
Too many of the arguments against 
lowering the voting age to 16 crumble 
when you really examine them clearly. 
Often the objection is simply that 16- 
year-olds are too young to exercise 
good judgment. This is really a patron-
izing thought. In fact, it is downright 
scary to think that we would have our 
government policies decide what con-
stitutes as wisdom for our young peo-
ple. 
It is past time for us to elevate vot-
ing as one of the central responsibil-
ities of our democracy. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CALVERT), 
my good friend. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment en bloc 
No. 4 and the underlying bill. 
I have a long list of concerns with 
this bill, and at the top of this list is 
nationwide ballot harvesting. 
Democrats in California have already 
legalized 
ballot 
harvesting 
in 
our 
State. Despite our concerns with the 
practice, Republicans were determined 
to play by the rules and utilized legal 
ballot collection methods in the last 
election. 
One amendment in this package, of-
fered by my California colleague, puts 
this hypocrisy on full display. Under 
current 
law, 
with 
my 
colleague’s 
amendment, 
a 
foreign 
operative— 
maybe a Russian operative, maybe a 
Chinese spy—could still handle ballots 
for untold numbers of people. My col-
league’s amendment is a blatant at-
tempt to criticize ballot harvesting 
only when the other guys do it. 
In other words, California Democrats 
think it is fine when their paid 
operatives collect ballots from strang-
ers and throw them in a bag. But they 
object when churches try to collect 
them for members of their congrega-
tion and put them in a box. 
Don’t be fooled. Democrats don’t 
want to facilitate ballot collection for 
all Americans. They just want to make 
it easier for their operatives to harvest 
ballots and will cry foul whenever Re-
publicans try to play by the same 
rules. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
this Chamber today thanks to the 
young people of Westchester and Rock-
land Counties. 
When I first ran for Congress, I was 
joined by a small group of young, com-
mitted volunteers. Many of them were 
not eligible to vote. Many of them were 
16 and 17 years old. And my goodness, 
did they know more about policy and 
national politics than people who are 
four and five times their senior. 
In this country, when you are 16 and 
17 years old, we charge you as an adult 
in the courtroom. You are able to drive 
to the job we expect you to work in 
order to help support your family. So I 
think that the least we can do is give 
16- and 17-year-olds a say in who gov-
erns them. 
b 1100 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE), an-
other great friend. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, the Con-
stitution vests primary responsibility 
in State legislatures to set the times, 
places, and manner of congressional 
elections, allowing States and local-
ities to determine how best to conduct 
elections that suit the needs of voters 
in their communities. 
But the bill before us today, and this 
amendment also, reverses the long-
standing history of State control over 
the electoral process, makes unconsti-
tutional changes to our election laws 
through a top-down Federal power 
grab, and places unprecedented limita-
tions on political speech. 
Rather than strengthening the elec-
tion process by working with Repub-
licans to find bipartisan solutions, H.R. 
1 was written without any input from 
Republican Members. Some of the most 
egregious 
provisions 
include 
man-
dating that States allow ballot har-
vesting, mandating same-day registra-
tion in all 50 States, abolishing the sig-
nature requirements for mail-in bal-
lots, mandating absentee ballots be ac-
cepted up to 10 days after election day, 
mandating that States send ballots in 
the mail proactively, and, finally, forc-
ing taxpayers to pay politicians to 
campaign for office. 
This bill is nothing more than an at-
tempt by Democrats to cement their 
fragile and fleeting majorities at tax-
payer expense. 
The bill would limit the free speech 
of my voters, use my voters’ tax dol-
lars to fund candidates, and violate the 
Constitution by superseding the Com-
monwealth’s ability to determine their 
own laws on voter eligibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this misguided and 
radical legislation. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, we 
must do right by the young organizers 
and activists who have fought for our 
democracy. They have a stake in our 
democracy, and they deserve to have a 
stake at the ballot box. 
Civil rights heroes like the late John 
Lewis taught us through example that 
no one is too young to fight for access 
to the ballot. In fact, he supported this 
very amendment last Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), a 
mediocre friend, not a great friend. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, after a divi-
sive election season, allegations of 
election fraud, objections to the elec-
toral college, and impeachment, a 
friend of mine on the other side of the 
aisle recently asked what it would take 
to unify our country. My answer is 
that it is certainly not this legislation 
which, from my standpoint, is the most 
divisive, unconstitutional, and destruc-
tive piece of legislation in my time in 
Congress. 
They call it the For the People Act, 
but it should be called the for the poli-
ticians act because it would force tax-
payers to fund political campaigns, in-
cluding the campaigns of politicians 
with whom those taxpayers disagree. 
Maybe a better name would be the 
election power grab act because it 
would normalize the chaos, uncer-
tainty, and irregularities surrounding 
mail-in voting in the 2020 election by 
centralizing the administration of elec-
tions in Washington, D.C., comman-
deering States to permanently expand 
mail-in voting without safeguards, le-
galize 
ballot 
harvesting, 
disregard 
voter ID laws, permit same-day voter 
registration without citizenship verifi-
cation, among other egregious meas-
ures. 
Mr. Speaker, election laws should 
make it easy to vote and hard to cheat. 
This bill would not only make it easy 
to cheat, but it would also effectively 
make it legal to cheat. 
At a time when half of Americans 
have lost confidence in the integrity of 
our elections, this bill will only drive 
distrust and division higher. 
Mr. Speaker, for the sake of ending 
division in our country, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this power 
grab of our elections. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. FALLON), an-
other mediocre friend. 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I have 
only been here 2 months, and in that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1027 
March 3, 2021 
time, I have seen some bad legislation. 
To date, this is one of the worst that I 
have seen. 
The age of consent has always coin-
cided with the franchise. For nearly 200 
years, it was 21. Then, in the 1970s, 
they changed it to 18. Our society has 
agreed since then, for 50 years, that 18 
is when a child becomes an adult. I find 
it interesting that our friends across 
the aisle don’t want to have 16- and 17- 
year-olds tried as adults when they 
commit violent adult crimes, yet they 
want those 16- and 17-year-olds to have 
the franchise. Some even, believe it or 
not, want 16- and 17-year-olds who are 
convicted of murder to be able to vote 
while they are in prison after they 
have been convicted. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
is 
a 
horrible 
amendment, and I respectfully request 
that all of our Members join us in vot-
ing ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

dinate lien on residential real property (in-

and cooperatives) designed principally for 
the occupancy of from 1- to 4- families. 
(f) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, and the Director of the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau may

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN) and the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each will control 
10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bloc of amend-
ments provides important additions to 
H.R. 1 that strengthen the bill and en-
hance voter access. 
Among the amendments in the bloc 
is an amendment from the gentle-
woman from Virginia that would re-
quire foreign agent disclaimers to be 
included on social media content. This 
increases transparency by requiring 
disclaimers to be embedded on the face 
of a social media post itself, and those 
disclaimers must remain whenever the 
post is subsequently shared. 
There are four amendments from the 
gentlewoman from California, includ-
ing one that addresses longstanding 
privacy concerns of survivors of domes-
tic and sexual abuse who want to reg-
ister to vote but do not want their per-
sonal information to be publicly acces-
sible; and a second that requires all in- 
person voting locations to have a suffi-
cient number of accessible voting ma-
chines for their voters. 
There is an amendment from the gen-
tleman from California that clarifies 
prohibitions on polling places or ballot 
drop boxes that falsely purport to be an 
official location established for an elec-
tion. 
I would note that, in California, the 
Republican Party in southern Cali-
fornia established drop boxes that pur-
ported to be from the registrar of vot-
ers. That was deceptive. An agreement 
was reached with the secretary of state 
that they could have the boxes, but 
they couldn’t hold themselves out to be 
the registrar of voters. 
H.R. 1 calls for all States to provide 
same-day voter registration. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan’s amendment 
makes an important addition that will 
help ensure the successful carrying out 
of this requirement: States must en-
sure that they have adequate copies of 
registration forms and other relevant 
voter registration at polling places. 
There is an amendment from the gen-
tleman from New York that requires 
the GAO to conduct a study on voter 
turnout rates, broken down by age in 
States and localities that permit vot-
ers to participate in elections before 
the age of 18. This is an issue that mer-
its examination, and this amendment 
will ensure that Congress is fully 
equipped to debate the issue. 
There is an amendment from the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois that would re-
quire the GAO to review small-donor 
campaign financing to study the extent 
to which the program increases oppor-
tunities for candidates of diverse ra-
cial, gender, and socioeconomic back-
grounds. 
There is an amendment from the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia that would re-
quire the Director of the CFPB to work 
with the EAC to develop a statement 
providing certain individuals with in-
formation regarding voter registration 
and their voting rights. This common-
sense reform ensures that tenants and 
homeowners will have easy access to 
voter registration and other voter-re-
lated information. 
Finally, there is an amendment from 
the gentlewoman from California that 
would ensure that the bill’s prohibi-
tions against election disinformation 
cover false claims that voters will face 
civil and other legal penalties for vot-
ing. 
I support these amendments, and I 
urge their adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the en 
bloc. I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. REED), a 
good friend and a problem solver. 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on an issue that is so important to so 
many of the people from my district, 
and that is election integrity. 
I am confident in the integrity of our 
democracy, but the fact remains that 
over 59 percent of Americans do not 
have confidence in the integrity of our 
election process. 
Time and time again, I have worked 
across the aisle with my Democratic 
colleagues to try to come together on 
commonsense reforms to address the 
issue of election integrity, and the 
issue that I am passionate about today 
is the question of voter ID. 
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP) and I had 
an amendment that we asked to be 
considered and debated on this floor to 
say that funds under this bill would not 
go to States that did not have a voter 
ID law in place. A simple reform to 
make sure that we have voter ID cards 
issued across America is a simple, com-
monsense integrity measure for our 
election systems to make sure that our 
votes count and the people casting the 
votes are those individuals who are 
registered to make that vote. 
We have IDs in America for simple 
things like buying alcohol, renting a 
car, and going into your grocery stores 
to get food stamps. We issue govern-
ment IDs for EBT cards. There are sim-
ple ways to make sure that people have 
access to identification so that they 
could perform one of the most funda-
mental civic duties and fundamental 
rights that we have, and that is to 
vote. 
To ask an individual to have an ID is 
a simple measure, and my Democratic 
colleagues did not allow us to have 
that debate and have an open, honest 
conversation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on these amendments and 
continue to work with us to ensure 
that the election integrity of our coun-
try is safe and secure. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1030 
March 3, 2021 
My amendment would require the 
Comptroller General to analyze the im-
pact of the voluntary small-donor fi-
nancing program on the racial, gender, 
and socioeconomic diversity of can-
didates for public office. 
As the first woman and first person 
of color to represent Illinois’ 14th Con-
gressional District, I know that Ameri-
cans with diverse backgrounds and ex-
periences are electable everywhere in 
this country, but too often, excellent 
candidates without personal wealth or 
corporate backing are outspent and 
overpowered long before the voters get 
a say. 
The 
Brennan 
Center 
found 
that 
small-donor 
financing 
cannot 
only 
make running for public office an op-
portunity for more Americans, but also 
increase the racial and gender diversity 
of our elected officials by giving every 
candidate a fighting chance. 
My amendment would make sure 
H.R. 1 fulfills its promise of letting the 
people decide who represents them. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK), who can take you on a 
tour of the best Philly cheesesteak 
places in the world. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, 
prior to my coming to Congress, I dedi-
cated my entire life as an FBI agent to 
fighting corruption and fighting for 
electoral reform, having overseen that 
program for the entire Nation. H.R. 1 
sets us back. 
H.R. 1 should not be called For the 
People. It should be called for the poli-
ticians. We know what we need to do to 
fix this system, Mr. Speaker. 
Several of my colleagues and I have 
introduced legislation that would actu-
ally restore faith in this institution 
and in the electoral process: term lim-
its, no budget-no pay, a balanced budg-
et amendment, single-issue legislation, 
abolishing congressional pensions, end-
ing ballot harvesting, providing free 
photo IDs to every registered voter, en-
suring signature matching, and, with 
the exception of military ballots, re-
quiring that all ballots be received by 8 
p.m. on election night. 
Mr. Speaker, this is common sense. 
What this body is doing today is the 
opposite. My colleagues are further 
eroding trust in this system, and that 
is a real shame because we have the op-
portunity to fix this. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to know why 
House leadership refuses to put these 
issues on the floor that would un-
equivocally pass with overwhelming 
margins in the House and the Senate. 
If it is going to pass overwhelmingly 
here, that means the American people 
want it. Let’s put those on the floor. 
b 1115 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my col-
league on the Committee on the Judi-
ciary. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her leadership and for adding 
to this legislation—my legislation—the 
For the People Act, adding the Coretta 
Scott King Mid-Decade Redistricting 
Prohibition Act that I wrote as long 
ago as 2006. 
Madam Speaker, section 2402 pro-
hibits a State that has been redis-
tricted in accordance with this legisla-
tion from doing it in the mid-decen-
nial, waiting till the next time, the de-
cennial apportionment; so no mid-dec-
ade kind of redistricting that has been 
so unhelpful to all of us. 
Madam Speaker, I rise, as well, to 
support the Swalwell amendments re-
garding the college student voting, as 
well as prohibiting false voting polling 
places and adding colleges and univer-
sities’ responsibility to give civic infor-
mation to our students. 
I also support the privacy informa-
tion required by the Speier amendment 
to ensure that there is no domestic vio-
lence and dating violence because your 
voting information gets out. 
And I also support the Waters amend-
ment that prohibits misinformation, 
which threatens potential voters with 
civil or legal penalties if they exercise 
their right to vote. I can assure you, 
this happens in the minority commu-
nity. 
And I do support the 16-years-of-age 
amendment, because if you can be on 
the front lines of civil rights and pro-
test for justice and democracy, you 
have the right to vote. 
Madam Speaker, let’s educate our 
young people so they can vote. I am 
very happy to support the en bloc. 
Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the ‘‘For the 
People Act of 2021,’’ which expands access to 
the ballot box, reduces the influence of big 
money in politics, and strengthens ethics rules 
for public servants. 
Specifically, the For the People Act will: 
Make it easier, not harder, to vote by imple-
menting automatic voter registration, requiring 
early voting and vote by mail, committing Con-
gress to reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act 
and ensuring the integrity of our elections by 
modernizing and strengthening our voting sys-
tems and ending partisan redistricting. 
Reform the campaign finance system by re-
quiring all political organizations to disclose 
large donors, updating political advertisement 
laws for the digital age, establishing a public 
matching system for citizen-owned elections, 
and revamping the Federal Election Commis-
sion to ensure there’s a cop on the campaign 
finance beat. 
Strengthen ethics laws to ensure that public 
officials work in the public interest by extend-
ing conflict of interest laws to the President 
and Vice President; requiring the release of 
their tax returns; closing loopholes that allow 
former members of Congress to avoid cooling- 
off periods for lobbying; closing the revolving 
door between industry and the federal govern-
ment; and establishing a code of conduct for 
the Supreme Court. 
H.R. 1 expands access to the ballot box by 
taking aim at institutional barriers to voting. 
This bill ensures that individuals who have 
completed felony sentences have their full 
rights restored and expands early voting and 
simplify absentee voting; and modernize the 
U.S. voting system. 
I am particularly proud and appreciative to 
Chairwoman LOFGREN and Congressman SAR-
BANES that the For The People Act incor-
porates in Section 2402 of the legislation the 
Coretta Scott King Mid-Decade Redistricting 
Prohibition Act that I first offered in 2006 dur-
ing the Judiciary Committee markup of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 reauthorization and 
as standalone legislation in the 114th Con-
gress. 
This provision, section 2402, prohibits a 
State that has been redistricted in accordance 
with this legislation from engaging in redis-
tricting again until after the next decennial ap-
portionment unless required by a court to do 
so to comply with the Constitution of the 
United States, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
the Constitution of the State, or the terms or 
conditions of this subtitle. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation is particu-
larly timely because more than 55 years after 
the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
we are still discussing voter suppression— 
something which should be a bygone relic of 
the past, but yet continues to disenfranchise 
racial minorities, immigrants, women, and 
young people. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a water-
shed moment for the Civil Rights Movement— 
it liberated communities of color from legal re-
strictions barring them from exercising the fun-
damental right to civic engagement and polit-
ical representation. 
But uncaged by Supreme Court’s infamous 
2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 
U.S. 
529 
(2013), 
which 
neutered 
the 
preclearance provision of the Voting Rights 
Act, 14 states, including my state of Texas, 
took extreme measures to enforce new voting 
restrictions before the 2016 presidential elec-
tion. 
If is not a coincidence that many of these 
same states have experienced increasing 
numbers of black and Hispanic voters in re-
cent elections. 
If not for invidious, state-sponsored voter 
suppression policies like discriminatory voter 
ID laws, reduced early voting periods, and 
voter intimidation tactics that directly or indi-
rectly target racial minorities, the 2016 presi-
dential election might have had a drastically 
different outcome. 
Madam Speaker, let me list some of the sal-
utary features of the legislation that will make 
it easier for Americans to exercise their right 
to vote, the most precious right of all because 
as President Johnson said in securing pas-
sage of the Voting Rights Act, the right to vote 
‘‘is preservative of all other rights.’’ 
H.R. 1 modernizes the voter registration 
system by requiring each state to make avail-
able online voter registration, correction, can-
cellation, and designation of party affiliation. 
In addition, H.R. 1: 
Requires states to permit voters to register 
on the day of a federal election, including dur-
ing early voting. 
Limits the authority of states to remove reg-
istrants from the official list of eligible voters in 
elections for federal office in the state based 
on interstate voter registration crosschecks . 
Requires states to provide annual reports on 
voter registration statistics to the Election As-
sistance Commission. 
Provides HAVA funds to implement the 
voter registration modernization reforms .

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1031 
March 3, 2021 
Makes it unlawful to hinder, interfere or pre-
vent an individual from registering to vote. 
Instructs the Election Assistance Commis-
sion to develop best practices for states to 
deter and prevent such violations. 
H.R. 1 explicitly prohibits ‘voter caging’, the 
pernicious practice of using returned non- 
forwardable mail as the basis for removing 
registered voters from the rolls, and it prohibits 
challenges to eligibility from individuals who 
are not election officials without an oath of 
good faith factual basis. 
Importantly, the legislation prohibits pro-
viding false information about elections to 
hinder or discourage voting and increases 
penalties for voter intimidation. 
I support the declaration in the legislation of 
the right of citizens to vote in federal elections 
will not be denied because of a criminal con-
viction unless a citizen is serving a felony sen-
tence in a correctional facility and it requires 
states and the federal government to notify in-
dividuals convicted of a state or federal felony, 
respectively, of their reenfranchisement 
H.R. 1 promotes election accuracy, integrity, 
and security by requiring states to use indi-
vidual, durable, voter-verified paper ballots 
and that said ballots be counted by hand or an 
optical character recognition device and that a 
voter be given the opportunity to correct his or 
her ballot should a mistake be made; and it 
also requires that provisional ballots from eligi-
ble voters at incorrect polling places be count-
ed. 
The legitimacy and stability of democratic 
governance is always enhanced by increased 
voter participation in elections, so I am very 
pleased that H.R. 1 outlaws many practices 
resorted to by voting opponents to reduce 
election participation. 
In particular, H.R. 1 requires at least 15 
consecutive days of early voting for federal 
elections and that early voting locations be 
near public transportation, in rural areas, and 
open for at least 10 hours per day. 
Additionally, the legislation prohibits a state 
from imposing restrictions on an individual’s 
ability to vote by mail and requires a state to 
carry out a program to track and confirm the 
receipt of absentee ballots and to make this 
information available to the voter who cast the 
ballot. 
Also, the bill requires the prepayment of 
postage on return envelopes for voting mate-
rials, which includes any voter registration 
form, any application for an absentee ballot, 
and any blank absentee ballot transmitted by 
mail. 
Madam Speaker, another important feature 
of H.R. 1 is that it promotes voter access by 
mandating several improvements to election 
administration, including: 
Treating universities as voter registration 
agencies; 
Requiring states to notify an individual, not 
later than 7 seven days before election, if the 
individual’s polling place has changed; 
Requiring states to allow voters to sign 
sworn affidavits to vote in lieu of presenting 
photo ID; 
Providing accommodations for voters resid-
ing in Indian lands; 
Ensuring equitable and efficient operation of 
polling places, reducing long lines and wait 
times for voters; 
Requiring states to provide secured drop 
boxes for voted absentee ballots in elections 
for federal office; 
Prohibiting states from restricting curbside 
voting; 
Imposing requirements for federal election 
contingency plans in response to natural dis-
asters and emergencies; and 
Clarifying that failure to vote is not grounds 
for removing registered voters from the rolls. 
Of course, nothing in this legislation pro-
hibits or restricts the authority of states to pro-
vide greater opportunities for voting, and the 
bill makes that explicitly clear. 
This litany of good measures demonstrates 
all the many ways and means through which 
H.R. 1 expands voter participation and elec-
tion integrity, and our experience of the pre-
vious four years counsels the urgency of 
adopting them. 
I am much less confident of the ability of 
one component of the bill—the title mandating 
creation of ‘‘Independent Redistricting Com-
missions’’—to strengthen our democracy; in 
fact I believe that title of the legislation should 
be stricken because of its potential to nega-
tively effective marginalized communities and 
minority groups. 
I am not contending that independent redis-
tricting commissions are an unconstitutional 
usurpation of authority belonging exclusively to 
state legislatures; that argument was pre-
sented and rejected by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona. 
Independent Redistricting Commission, 576 
U.S. 787 (2015). 
Instead, the nation’s experience with inde-
pendent redistricting commissions is still in its 
early stages, and I believe that instead of 
mandating a one-size fits all approach, Con-
gress should allow further experimentation to 
occur in the states, the ‘‘laboratories of de-
mocracy,’’ as they were described by Justice 
Brandeis in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 
285 U.S. 262 (1932). 
In addition, it appears to me that the selec-
tion process laid out in the bill for choosing 
members of the independent redistricting com-
missions is too random and will not result in 
a commission comprised of members reflec-
tive of the communities directly affected by the 
work of the commission, particularly members 
of racial and language minorities. 
Madam Speaker, the issue of redistricting 
and how to do it fairly is a never-ending one, 
and, as most political scientists agree, it is vir-
tually impossible to draw most congressional 
and legislative districts in ways that are com-
petitive; redistricting exacerbates geographical 
polarization, but it does not create it. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1 must be passed 
because many of the civil rights that I fought 
for as a student and young lawyer have been 
undermined or been rolled back by reactionary 
forces in recent years. 
To add insult to injury, the immediately pre-
ceding Administration issued an Executive 
Order establishing a so-called ‘‘Election Integ-
rity’’ Commission to investigate not voter sup-
pression, but so-called ‘‘voter fraud’’ in the 
2016 election. 
The 45th President and his followers were 
unceasing in their efforts to perpetuate the 
myth of voter fraud, but it remains just that: a 
myth. 
Between 2000 and 2014, there were 35 
credible allegations of voter fraud out of more 
than 834 million ballots cast—that is less than 
1 in 28 million votes. 
An extensive study by social scientists at 
Dartmouth College uncovered no evidence to 
support Trump’s hysterical and outrageous al-
legations of widespread voter fraud ‘‘rigging’’ 
the 2016 election. 
Just for the record, Madam Speaker, the 
popular vote of the 2016 presidential election 
was: 
Hillary Clinton: 65,853,5160. 
Donald Trump: 62,884,8240. 
Trump’s deficit of 2.9 million was the largest 
of any Electoral College winner in history by a 
massive margin, and despite the allegations of 
the current Administration, there have been 
only 4 documented cases of voter fraud in the 
2016 election. 
The same is true for the 2020 presidential 
election, which again Donald Trump claimed 
was fraudulent after losing the popular vote to 
President Biden by more than 7 million votes, 
and the Electoral College by 306–232, the 
exact margin that he claimed constituted a 
landslide and epic blowout when he won the 
Electoral College vote in 2016. 
Again, and just for the record, Madam 
Speaker, the popular vote of the 2020 presi-
dential election was: 
Joe Biden: 81,281,502. 
Donald Trump: 74,222,593. 
The Trump Campaign brought more than 63 
legal challenges to the 2020 election, claiming 
the outcomes were tainted by wide-spread 
and massive fraud but every court, whether 
state or federal, and nearly 90 judges, includ-
ing Trump appointees, summarily rejected 
these baseless claims for failure of proof. 
Of course, this did not deter the reckless 
45th President who then went on to threaten 
and coerce state election officials to corruptly 
change vote counts and after that ploy failed, 
incited his loyalists to storm the U.S. Capitol 
and use force and violence if necessary to 
prevent the Congress from conducting the 
constitutionally required Joint Meeting to count 
the electoral votes cast and announce the win-
ner of the presidential election. 
Madam Speaker, the Trump Voter Fraud 
Commission, like many of Trump’s business 
schemes, was a massive scam built on count-
less lies that did not hold up to any level of 
scrutiny. 
As Members of Congress, we should be de-
voting our time, energy, and resources ad-
dressing Russian infiltration of our election in-
frastructure and campaigns, along with other 
pressing issues. 
Instead of enjoying and strengthening the 
protections guaranteed in the Voting Rights 
Act—people of color, women, LGBTQ individ-
uals, and immigrants—have been given the 
joyless, exhausting task of fending off the con-
stant barrage of attacks leveled at our commu-
nities by Trump and other conspiracy theo-
rists. 
Not only are we tasked with reversing the 
current dismal state of voter suppression 
against minorities; we are forced to refute the 
blatant, propagandist lie of voter fraud. 
To this end, I have been persistent in my ef-
forts to protect the rights of disenfranchised 
communities in my district of inner-city Hous-
ton and across the nation. 
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have 
cosponsored dozens of bills, amendments, 
and resolutions seeking to improve voters’ 
rights at all stages and levels of the election 
process. 
This includes legislation aimed at: 
Increasing voter outreach and turnout;

March 3, 2021 
Ensuring both early and same-day registra-
tion; 
Standardizing physical and language acces-
sibility at polling places; 
Expanding early voting periods; 
Decreasing voter wait times; 
Guaranteeing absentee ballots, especially 
for displaced citizens; 
Modernizing 
voting 
technologies 
and 
strengthening our voter record systems; 
Establishing the federal Election Day as a 
national holiday; and 
Condemning and criminalizing deceptive 
practices, voter intimidation, and other sup-
pression tactics. 
Along with many of my CBC colleagues, I 
was an original cosponsor of H.R. 9, the 
Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta 
Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization 
and Amendments Act, which became public 
law on July 27, 2006. 
I also authored H.R. 745 in the 110th Con-
gress, which added the legendary Barbara 
Jordan to the list of civil rights trailblazers 
whose memories are honored in the naming of 
the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and 
Amendments Act. 
This bill strengthened the original Voting 
Rights Act by replacing federal voting exam-
iners with federal voting observers—a signifi-
cant enhancement that made it easier to safe-
guard against racially biased voter suppres-
sion tactics. 
As noted earlier, in the 114th Congress, I in-
troduced H.R. 75, the Coretta Scott King Mid- 
Decade Redistricting Prohibition Act of 2015, 
which prohibits states whose congressional 
districts have been redistricted after a decen-
nial census from redrawing their district lines 
until the next census. 
Prejudiced redistricting, or gerrymandering 
as it is more commonly known, has been used 
for decades to weaken the voting power of Af-
rican Americans, Latino Americans, and other 
minorities since the Civil Rights Era. 
Immediately after the Shelby County v. 
Holder ruling, which lifted preclearance re-
quirements for states with histories of discrimi-
nation seeking to change their voting laws or 
practices, redistricting became a favorite tool 
for Republicans who connived to unfairly gain 
3 congressional seats in Texas. 
In the 110th Congress, I was the original 
sponsor of H.R. 6778, the Ex Offenders Voting 
Rights Act of 2008, which prohibited denial of 
the right to vote in a federal election on the 
basts of an individual’s status as a formerly in-
carcerated person. 
The Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act sought 
to reverse discriminatory voter restrictions that 
disproportionately affect the African American 
voting population, which continues to be tar-
geted by mass incarceration, police profiling, 
and a biased criminal justice system. 
Those of us who cherish the right to vote 
justifiably are skeptical of Voter ID laws be-
cause we understand how these laws, like poll 
taxes and literacy tests, can be used to im-
pede or negate the ability of seniors, racial 
and language minorities, and young people to 
cast their votes. 
Voter ID laws are just one of the means that 
can be used to abridge or suppress the right 
to vote but there are others, including: 
Curtailing or Eliminating Early Voting; 
Ending Same-Day Registration; 
Not counting povisional ballots cast in the 
wrong precinct on Election Day; 
Eliminating Teenage Pre-Registration; 
Shortened Poll Hours; 
Lessening the standards governing voter 
challenges used by vigilantes, like the King 
Street Patriots in my city of Houston, to cause 
trouble at the polls; 
‘‘Voter Caging,’’ to suppress the turnout of 
minority voters by sending non-forwardable 
mail to targeted populations and, once the 
mail is returned, using the returned mail to 
compile lists of voters whose eligibility is then 
challenged on the basis of residence under 
state law; and 
Employing targeted redistricting techniques 
to dilute minority voting strength, notably 
‘‘Cracking’’ (i.e., fragmenting and dispersing 
concentrations 
of 
minority 
populations); 
‘‘Stacking’’ ( combining concentrations of mi-
nority voters with greater concentrations of 
white populations); and ‘‘Packing’’ (i.e., over-
concentrating minority voters in as few districts 
as possible). 
Madam Speaker, we must not allow our de-
mocracy to slide back into the worst elements 
of this country’s past, to stand idly by as our 
treasured values of democracy, progress, and 
equality are poisoned and dismantled. 
I urge all members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 1, the ‘‘For The People Act of 
2021.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the 
rule governing debate of H.R. 1, the ‘‘For the 
People Act of 2021,’’ which expands access to 
the ballot box, reduces the influence of big 
money in politics, and strengthens ethics rules 
for public servants. 
H.R. 1 is intended to increase public con-
fidence in our democracy by reducing the role 
of money in politics, restoring ethical stand-
ards 
and 
integrity 
to 
government, 
and 
strengthening laws to protect voting. 
I am particularly proud and appreciative to 
Chairwoman LOFGREN and Congressman SAR-

title E, Part 2. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Naples, Florida, 
(Mr. DONALDS), my good friend, who 
represents many of my former con-
stituents from Illinois who have left Il-
linois because of overtaxation. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act. This is really just a take-
over of elections by Washington, D.C. 
Madam Speaker, I got a chance to go 
through some of this bill—790 pages. 
Most of these things would basically 
eviscerate Florida’s election law. 
You see, I served in Florida’s legisla-
ture. We had the responsibility for ad-
justing legislation law from time to 
time. Our State was a State that went 
through hanging chads in 2000, and we 
have made the adjustment systemati-
cally in the State legislature to make 
sure that Florida has the very best 
election laws in these United States. 
You see, on election night, November 
3, we were done counting around 9:30. 
We knew the results by 10 o’clock. We 
have absentee ballots, we have voter 
ID, we have early voting, and we have 
a robust count system on election day. 
The people of Florida have never 
been disenfranchised when it comes to 
elections. The people of Florida have 
come accustomed to having a voter 
system that works. And what this body 
is trying to do with H.R. 1 is com-
pletely destroy Florida’s election laws. 
That is, to me, ridiculous. This Capitol 
should never allow that. If we are going 
to do anything, we should replicate 
what Florida has actually done. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). The gentleman needs to 
put his mask up. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
am sorry. It keeps falling down. 
Madam Speaker, I was trying to 
make a point— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman is expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
15 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, the 
point is clear: 33 States have voter ID 
laws. Many States have already taken 
care of these problems themselves. 
State legislatures should be changing 
their laws. This Capitol should not. 
And the people of the State of Florida 
definitely do not want the things that 
are in this bill. Our system is the best. 
Frankly, leave Florida alone. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, before I reserve, can I 
make a parliamentary inquiry? 
When a mask falls down unintention-
ally from a speaker, what is the rule? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers must properly wear their masks at 
all times. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Is 
this being enforced equally on the ma-
jority and minority? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will not answer a hypothetical 
question, but the Speaker’s announced 
policy applies to all Members. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. So I 
should ask the second-rate parliamen-
tarian off the floor? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not stating a proper par-
liamentary inquiry. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time each side has 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 41⁄2 min-
utes. The gentleman from Illinois has 6 
minutes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to H.R. 1 to crack down on for-
eign-backed disinformation and propa-
ganda on social media. This amend-
ment is the text of the Bipartisan For-
eign Agent Disclaimer Enhancement— 
FADE—Act. 
Under the FADE Act, political ads, 
issue campaigns, and content funded or 
directed by a foreign principal and in-
tended to influence the American peo-
ple must be disclosed to the Depart-
ment of Justice. But too often, this 
rule does not extend to the world of so-
cial media. 
Additionally, foreign agents acting 
from abroad too often evade current 
disclaimer 
requirements. 
Amid 
the 
pandemic and following the 2020 gen-
eral election, foreign governments con-
tinue to exploit existing vulnerabilities 
in our national security, including in-
fluencing Americans directly and infil-
trating public discourse without their 
knowledge. Foreign adversaries, such 
as Russia, China, and Iran, are among 
the most active, and they are increas-
ingly assertive in their efforts. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment 
will help protect against foreign influ-
ence that seeks to sow political divi-
sion and promote dangerous informa-
tion contrary to the Foreign Agents 
Registration Act. 
My amendment would require dis-
claimers—clearly stating this content 
is coming from a foreign principal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1034 
March 3, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
VAN DREW), my good friend and best- 
dressed member of our conference. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
am not so sure about that, but I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 1. 
We were warned for years about the 
rise of socialism. Well, here it is, 
served on a platter, using your money 
to pay for politicians campaigns. 
Do you like those robocalls during 
campaign season? 
How about the negative TV ads and 
the mailers? 
Or how about all of the political stuff 
that just comes out? 
Well, your tax dollars are paying for 
them. And, yes, this is taxpayer dol-
lars, no matter how they tell you oth-
erwise. 
Madam Speaker, this bill puts Wash-
ington, D.C., in charge of our States’ 
elections and how those elections are 
run. It would keep the status quo, like 
we saw this past November, with voter 
rolls that are not up to date and live 
ballots being mailed to voters who 
have died, moved, or even multiple bal-
lots to the same voter. 
Madam Speaker, elections do have 
consequences. And when leaders said 
the goal was to change America, they 
were telling the truth; and here we are. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS), who 
serves in the seat of our late, beloved 
John Lewis. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, it is our duty to not only do 
the work of the people, but to ensure 
that people have a voice in our democ-
racy. 
H.R. 1 amplifies the voice of the peo-
ple, empowers individuals to shape our 
democracy, and breaks down barriers 
to voting. It is historymaking by de-
sign, as a portion of H.R. 1 was written 
by my predecessor, Congressman John 
Lewis. We must honor his legacy and 
take this necessary step forward be-
cause Georgians and all people in this 
country deserve to retain their right to 
accessible elections. 
Madam Speaker, I have added provi-
sions to this bill that underscore not 
only the importance of voting, but 
making it easier for hardworking peo-
ple to do so. And making it easier, not 
harder to vote, should always be our 
main concern. 
Madam Speaker, this week, Georgia’s 
legislators moved forward to further 
restrict Black and Brown communities 
from voting by enacting new ID laws 
for absentee ballot applications and 
limiting the use of ballot drop boxes— 
old tactics, but the same tricks. We 
cannot 
let 
self-serving 
politicians 
stack the deck through voter suppres-
sion and discrimination. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the passage of H.R. 
1 so that we can make it easier for peo-
ple to cast their ballots and have their 
voices be heard. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a summary of letters sub-
mitted yesterday by the Institute for 
Free 
Speech 
and 
others 
opposing 
H.R. 1. 
INSTITUTE FOR FREE SPEECH, 
March 3, 2021. 
Re H.R. 1 Would Greatly Harm Free Speech. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The Institute for 
Free Speech strongly opposes H.R. 1, the Or-
wellian For the People Act. More appro-
priately known as the For the Politicians 
Act, this radical bill would, in fact, greatly 
harm the ability of the people to freely 
speak, publish, organize into groups, and pe-
tition their elected representatives in pur-
suit of a better government. 
In particular, H.R. 1 would impose onerous 
and unworkable standards on the ability of 
Americans and groups of Americans to dis-
cuss the policy issues of the day with elected 
officials and the public. Certain sections of 
the bill would violate the privacy of advo-
cacy groups and their supporters, limit polit-
ical speech on the internet, and compel 
speakers to recite lengthy government-man-
dated messages identifying some of their 
supporters by name in their communica-
tions. 
Importantly, 
these 
restrictions 
would 
reach far beyond campaign speech to regu-
late discussion of legislative issues and pub-
lic affairs. For advocacy groups, unions, and 
trade associations, several of the limits pro-
posed in H.R. 1 would operate as a total ban 
on speech 
If signed into law, all of these provisions 
would be interpreted and enforced by a newly 
partisan 
Federal 
Election 
Commission. 
Under H.R. 1, the Commission would be radi-
cally transformed from its historic and de-
liberately bipartisan structure to one under 
partisan control of the president. As nine 
former members of the Federal Election 
Commission with a combined 60 plus years of 
service warned in a recent letter to Congress, 
the likely impact would be to shrink public 
confidence in the impartial enforcement of 
campaign finance laws, weaponize these reg-
ulations for partisan gain, and silence much 
political speech through new rules on groups 
that speak about public affairs 
H.R. 1 would also force Americans to pay 
for speech they oppose. This new financing 
system is a riverboat gamble on an untest-
ed—and costly—scheme that would have 
many unforeseen effects. Existing research 
has proven that similar schemes elsewhere 
have failed to achieve proponents’ stated 
goals. Instead, the program will likely 
incentivize—and subsidize—candidates with 
hateful messages, create new avenues for 
corruption, increase polarization, give gov-
ernment greater control over campaigns, 
waste tax dollars, and fail markedly at im-
proving the quality of governance or the di-
versity of those who are elected to higher of-
fice 
At its core, H.R. 1 would greatly increase 
the already high legal and administrative 
compliance costs, liability risk, and costs to 
donor and associational privacy for civic 
groups that speak about policy issues. Orga-
nizations will be further deterred from 
speaking or will have to divert additional re-
sources away from their advocacy activities 
to pay for compliance staff and lawyers. 
Some groups will not be able to afford these 
costs or will violate the law unwittingly. 
The effect will be less speech by Americans 
and organizations, allowing politicians to 
act with less accountability to public opin-
ion and criticism. 
Few bills are more antithetical to the text 
of 
and 
principles 
underlying 
the 
First 
Amendment than H.R. 1. The numerous, 
overlapping, and interrelated provisions in 
this legislation combine to impose and tight-
en severe government controls on speech 
about campaigns, judicial nominees, and pol-
icy issues in truly shocking ways. Any 
American lacking expertise in campaign fi-
nance law would have little to no hope of un-
derstanding this bill or the voluminous re-
strictions it proposes on political speech and 
association. The sad result will be a political 
discourse dominated by Washington, DC in-
siders. Far from being For the People, H.R. 1 
is truly For the Politicians. 
The best way to give the American people 
a voice and to safeguard democracy is to pro-
tect and enhance the right to free speech 
guaranteed by the First Amendment. While 
the Institute takes no position on the myr-
iad provisions in H.R. 1 that deal with elec-
tion administration, voting rights, and redis-
tricting, the portions of H.R. 1 that trample 
on free speech are sufficient to warrant our 
firm opposition to this measure. For the 
above reasons, the Institute for Free Speech 
strongly opposes passage of H.R. 1. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID KEATING, 
President. 
ILLINOIS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Springfield, IL, February 19, 2021. 
To: Illinois Federal Delegation 
Fr: Illinois Representative Joe Sosnowski, 
69th District, Illinois House of Rep-
resentatives 
TO THE ILLINOIS FEDERAL DELEGATION: As a 
state legislator elected to be a voice for the 
people of Illinois, I write to express my oppo-
sition to H.R. 1/S. 1, an unconstitutional 
takeover of citizens’ right to free speech and 
association. 
As elected officials, we both have a duty to 
represent our constituents best interests and 
a responsibility to defend the United States 
Constitution. Therefore, it is my obligation 
to urge you to oppose the deceptively named 
For the People Act. The legislation is ill- 
considered and deeply unconstitutional, and 
I have seen firsthand the chilling effects of 
the donor disclosure provisions that it would 
enact. 
As a member of the American Legislative 
Exchange Council, a membership organiza-
tion of state legislators dedicated to prin-
ciples of limited government, free markets 
and federalism. In 2013, activists launched a 
campaign to reveal, then harass and shame, 
the ALEC donor base. Their goal was simple: 
Harassing ALEC donors and corporate mem-
bers would chill their participation with and 
support for the organization, ultimately cut-
ting off a funding source for ALEC. 
Worse, public elected officials used their 
platform to heighten this threat of donor 
disclosure in order to further intimidate 
ALEC supporters. In 2013, every company 
tangentially associated with ALEC received 
an official letter from US Senator Richard 
Durbin, demanding to know whether it had 
served as a member of ALEC or provided any 
funding to ALEC, with the intent of intimi-
dating them. Durbin wrote that he would 
read their responses into the official Con-
gressional 
record, 
forever 
memorializing 
their support and creating a public target 
list for activists opposed to the organization. 
Even the Chicago Tribune, the Senator’s 
hometown newspaper that had endorsed his 
candidacy, rebuked Durbin’s attempt at cre-
ating an enemies list by using his high fed-
eral office as a cudgel against his enemies. 
H.R. 1/S. 1 would institutionalize this har-
assment and intimidation and extend it to 
all nonprofits, regardless of their issue area 
or political persuasion. Whatever issues you

March 3, 2021 
support or oppose, this should be of serious 
concern to you. If this legislation is enacted, 
passionate activists on both sides of the aisle 
would have access to a government-run data-
base of donors who give to every organiza-
tion from ALEC and the Family Research 
Council to the ACLU and Planned Parent-
hood. Does anyone doubt that the blunt in-
strument of donor disclosure in H.R. 1/S. 1 
would put millions of Americans’ peace and 
livelihoods at risk of significant, material 
harm? 
These tactics are flimsy bureaucratic 
structures designed to harass nonprofits and 
chill speech, despite fundamental violations 
of the First Amendment. In keeping with to-
day’s cancel culture, H.R. 1/S. 1 is a govern-
ment-sanctioned attempt to chill speech and 
participation. Good governance watchdogs 
argue this measure increases transparency. 
Transparency is good when applied to gov-
ernment, but when it strips away Constitu-
tionally protected privacy for individuals, it 
is exceedingly dangerous. For the federal 
government to expose our constituents as 
supporters of any nonprofit’s cause would be 
an enormous overreach of centralized power. 
If passed, the donor disclosure provisions 
in H.R. 1/S. 1 would bludgeon our democratic 
institutions and threaten the safety and 
peace of our everyday constituents. It would 
further normalize the darkness of cancel cul-
ture and intimidation through overregula-
tion in American society. Therefore, we call 
on you to oppose H.R. 1/S. 1. 
Sincerely, 
Representative JOE 
SOSNOWSKI, 
69th District, Illinois 
House of Represent-
atives, Illinois ALEC 
State Chair. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, over the last couple 
of days, I have spoken a lot about my 
opposition to this bill’s creation of a 
public fund filled with dollars from cor-
porate fines to directly fund the cam-
paign coffers of every Member of this 
institution and candidates. 
And my Democrat colleagues have 
continued to say this isn’t public fund-
ing or corporate donations because it is 
corporate fines. 
So what is the truth? 
I think my chart here tells the story. 
So we have corporate fines. That is cor-
porate dollars, something that we, as 
Members of Congress in our campaigns, 
cannot accept right now. Those cor-
porate dollars that pay these corporate 
fines that we set the levels of in this 
institution, they then go to the U.S. 
Government in this new—that H.R. 1 
creates—the Freedom From Influence 
Fund. 
It is really a laundering machine. So 
they launder that corporate money 
that we cannot accept right now into 
the Treasury and it comes out clean as 
public money. It is money that used to 
be used for things like the Crime Vic-
tims Fund. Instead, this new laundered 
money, this taxpayer money—because 
it is public, it is under the control of 
us—then goes out exponentially to all 
of us, to our campaigns to pay for at-
tack ads, fundraisers, mailers, phone 
calls, whatever you want. 
But either way, it is government 
spending—government 
sending 
cor-
porate dollars directly to us. This is, 
and should be, prohibited, but H.R. 1 
changes that and it puts more money 
into politics and not less. 
How about the Crime Victims Fund 
or victims of domestic violence get 
these dollars? 
Let’s make sure that we address pro-
grams that deal with sexual assault, 
child abuse, and other crimes. This 
money will not go into the Crime Vic-
tims Fund because it is going to all of 
us. All 50 State attorneys general have 
told us that this vital Crime Victims 
Fund is nearly depleted. But instead of 
plussing it up, here we are today, fund-
ing our own campaigns with a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, this bill isn’t for the 
people. It is for the politicians. This is 
why I am offering a motion to recom-
mit so that we can put forward a bill 
that works for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt this mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on House Administration to 
consider an amendment to remove all 
public financing from this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include in the RECORD the 
text of the amendment immediately 
prior to the vote on the motion to re-
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, it is one reason I am 
opposed to H.R. 1, and giving Demo-
crats another chance to join me, stop-
ping this charade, stopping enriching 
themselves in their own campaign. 
This is one last chance before you do it 
again. 
Madam Speaker, another reason I op-
pose H.R. 1 is because the election 
mandates on States in this bill go 
against what our Founding Fathers in-
tended and essentially nationalizes our 
election system. 
If signed into law, H.R. 1 would be 
the greatest expansion of the Federal 
Government’s role in our elections 
than we have ever seen. By moving 
these decisions to D.C., we are further 
removing people from the laws that 
govern their elections. People should 
have more say in how their elections 
are run, not less. Our goal is to always 
ensure all eligible voters are able to 
vote and all lawful votes are counted. 
That is not what H.R. 1 does. And the 
only witness who has run an election 
before said during the single House Ad-
ministration hearing held on this bill 
that H.R. 1 will undermine many of the 
election laws States have put into 
place to make it easier for people to 
vote and improve their election process 
for their voters. 
One-size-fits-all 
mandates 
from 
Washington will not fix the problems 
we have seen in elections across the 
country. They will just cause more 
chaos and confusion. These issues need 
to be solved at the local and State 
level. Instead of dictating to States, we 
should be working with them and local-
ities to address these issues. And I 
stand ready and willing to work with 
my Democrat colleagues to do just 
that, but I will not vote for a Federal 
takeover of elections and I will not 
vote to use the Federal Government to 
put more money into my campaign. It 
is bad policy and it is bad for the 
American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the motion to recommit at the appro-
priate time, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1130 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close if the gentleman 
is ready to yield back or use the rest of 
his time. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to re-
quest a meeting with the Parliamen-
tarian. I personally witnessed one of 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
imme-
diately remove his mask and was never 
told to put it back on from the Chair at 
the time. So all we ask for is consist-
ency. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this bill. I urge support for the mo-
tion to recommit. I urge my Demo-
cratic colleagues: Don’t vote to put 
money into your own campaigns. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the 
secretary of state of Colorado, with a 
number of other secretary of states, 
urging support for this bill; and a let-
ter from former leaders of the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union and con-
cerned first amendment scholars urg-
ing support.

DEAR LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER PELOSI,

It’s no accident that the 2020 elections were 
the most secure in American history. A mon-
umental effort by election administrators— 
from board of elections officials, to county 
clerks, to poll workers—ensured our coun-
try’s democratic process was stronger than 
ever, even with the unique challenge posed 
by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
While the 2020 elections proved that our de-
mocracy is resilient, the elections also 
showed us that they cannot be taken for 
granted. Our elections were safe, secure, and 
successful because countless patriotic Amer-
icans took action to protect them. The poli-

March 3, 2021 
register to vote and cast a ballot in the face 
of the pandemic were a resounding success 
and must now be made permanent. 
Modernizing elections meant that eligible 
voters did not have to choose between cast-
ing a ballot and risking their health. It also 
resulted in record turnout for both parties. 
Policies like vote-by mail for all and early 
voting saw resounding success in states and 
municipalities across the country. Now, only 
Congress can ensure that every eligible voter 
across America has access to these voting 
options in the future. That’s why we need to 
immediately enact the For The People Act 
(H.R. 1) into law. 
The For The People Act offers a comprehen-
sive path to securing and modernizing Amer-
ican democracy for generations to come. The 
bill provides clear guidance for all 50 states 
and the District of Columbia to implement 
election processes that work for administra-
tors and voters alike, and its adoption into 
law is critical to the future of American 
elections. Proven policies such as automatic 
and same-day voter registration will remove 
administrative obstacles for eligible voters 
while maintaining up-to-date and accurate 
voter rolls. Voter-verified paper ballots will 
ensure every vote is accurately recorded and 
allow administrators to run key audits to 
verify election results. Other provisions, 
such as independent redistricting commis-
sions to combat gerrymandering and shining 
light on dark money, will further strengthen 
the integrity of our elections. 
As the chief elections officials in our re-
spective states, and as the administrators 
who will be tasked with executing many of 
the policies proposed in H.R. 1, we can con-
fidently state that this bill is designed to 
make our democracy stronger and safer than 
ever. We proudly and firmly support the For 
The People Act, and we strongly recommend 
its passage in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and U.S. Senate. 
Sincerely, 
Katie Hobbs, Arizona Secretary of State; 
Shirley Weber, California Secretary of State; 
Jena Griswold, Colorado Secretary of State;

FORMER LEADERS OF THE AMERICAN 
CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION AND CON-

ARS, 
February 18, 2021. 
Re H.R. 1, For the People Act. 
Hon. ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chair, House Administration Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. JOHN SARBANES, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chair, House Judiciary Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR LOFGREN, CHAIR NADLER, AND 
REP. SARBANES: The undersigned are former 
leaders of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) and concerned academics who 
have devoted much of their careers to the de-
fense of the First Amendment and the pro-
tection of American democracy. We write in 
support of speedy House enactment of H.R.1, 
the For the People Act. 
American democracy is at a perilous cross-
roads. H.R.1 responds with sweeping reforms 
countering voter suppression and partisan 
gerrymandering that have targeted commu-
nities of color; overhauling our deeply in-
equitable campaign finance system; and re-
ducing the influence of secret ‘‘dark money’’ 
in federal elections. We view H.R. 1 as the 
most significant prodemocracy legislation 
since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
Some have argued that despite the over-
whelmingly positive content of H.R.1, enact-
ment should be delayed in the House pending 
legislative hearings and efforts to amend 
certain provisions in the 700-page legislation, 
especially provisions requiring disclosure of 
the identities of large donors to tax-exempt 
organizations operating on the margins of 
electoral politics We agree that, ordinarily, 
best legislative practice would call for hear-
ings designed to resolve First Amendment 
concerns over important legislation. But, 
given the importance of shoring up the 
democratic process, the limited window of 
opportunity for passage of H.R.1, the likely 
delay in Senate consideration, and the na-
ture of the First Amendment objections to 
disclosure, we believe that immediate pas-
sage of H.R.1 in its present form is the pref-
erable course of action. 
Objectors to immediate passage of HR 1 ap-
pear to us to: (1) underestimate the risks to 
enacting HR 1 posed by substantial delay in 
House passage; (2) understate the importance 
of closing loopholes in our campaign finance 
disclosure laws; and (3) overstate the risks to 
First Amendment freedom posed by the bill’s 
disclosure provisions. We live in a demo-
cratic culture saturated by great wealth. 
The Supreme Court has rendered it almost 
impossible to directly regulate the role of 
money in determining electoral outcomes. 
One of the few practical reform windows left 
open is public disclosure of the sources of 
money-driven influence over electoral poli-
tics. Such disclosure is important, not only 
to prevent corruption, but to allow ordinary 
citizens to evaluate the truth of electoral 
speech by knowing who is paying for it. We 
recognize the need to preserve anonymity for 
persons whose speech or association might 
be deterred by fear of disclosure. That is why 
the H.R.1 disclosure rules apply. only to 
large donations exceeding $10,000. Moreover, 
current First Amendment doctrine already 
provides an ‘‘as applied’’ exception to disclo-
sure rules if a genuine fear of retaliatory ac-
tion were to exist. 
In short, we do not view First Amendment 
concerns over the precise scope of disclosure 
requirements affecting large donors to tax 
exempt organizations operating on the mar-
gins of electoral politics as outweighing the 
need for expeditious enactment of the clear-
ly desirable aspects of H.R.1 into law. 
We urge you to press for speedy enactment 
of H.R. 1 in its current form.

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I appreciate that the ranking mem-
ber has shown us this chart because he 
has proven that all of the Republican 
Members claiming that there was tax 
money funding the pilot project for the 
small matching donors were wrong. 
This is a pilot project that is funded 
by an additional fine on corporate 
wrongdoing. It doesn’t take money 
away from anything else. It is an addi-
tional fine that, if H.R. 1 doesn’t pass, 
will not be imposed. 
I was interested to hear our colleague 
from New Jersey say it is your money 
that will be used. Well, it is only your 
money if you are a corporate malfea-
sance individual, a corporate wrong-
doer that gets fined; and I don’t think 
very many of us have sympathy for 
that crew. 
I would like to just give some per-
spective here because all over the 
United States, because of the pan-
demic, efforts were made to allow for 
people to vote and not have to endan-
ger their health. So absentee voting be-
came more of the norm. There were 
more early voting efforts, a lot of 
things of that nature, because of the 
pandemic. 
And what happened? 
There was a huge increase in turnout, 
both among Republicans and Demo-
crats. It was a safe and secure election, 
the most safe and secure election in 
modern history. There wasn’t a bunch 
of fraud. 
Some of my colleagues said that peo-
ple don’t trust our system. 
Why is that? 
Because there are politicians in this 
country that are misleading the Amer-
ican public about that election. And I 
would say the former President is first 
among them, telling things that are 
not true and convincing people of that. 
So now that we have had this huge 
turnout because of the pandemic, we 
are seeing States—Republicans, I must 
say, unfortunately, all over the United 
States trying to cut off access to the 
ballot. 
In Georgia, they just passed a whole 
slew of voter restriction measures to 
try and tamp down turnout, and we see 
hundreds of bills being introduced to do 
that. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this en bloc 
and on the underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 179, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
ZIMBABWE—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–20) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with re-
spect to the actions and policies of cer-
tain members of the Government of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic proceses 
or institutions is to continue in effect 
beyond March 6, 2021. 
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has 
not made the necessary political and 
economic reforms that would warrant 
terminating the existing targeted sanc-
tions program. Throughout the last 
year, 
government 
security 
services 
routinely intimidated and violently re-
pressed citizens, including members of 
opposition 
political 
parties, 
union 
members, and journalists. The absence 
of progress on the most fundamental 
reforms needed to ensure the rule of 
law, democratic governance, and the 
protection of human rights leaves 
Zimbabweans vulnerable to ongoing re-
pression and presents a continuing 
threat to peace and security in the re-
gion. 
The actions and policies of certain 
members 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288, as amended, with respect to

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
UKRAINE—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–21) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, with re-
spect to Ukraine is to continue in ef-
fect beyond March 6, 2021. 
The actions and policies of persons 
that undermine democratic processes 
and institutions in Ukraine; threaten 
its 
peace, 
security, 
stability, 
sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity; and 
contribute to the misappropriation of 
its assets, and the actions and policies 
of the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration, including its purported annex-
ation of Crimea and its use of force in 
Ukraine, continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the na-
tional security and foreign policy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13660 with respect 
to Ukraine.

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-

from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs

tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, with re-
spect to the situation in Venezuela is 
to continue in effect beyond March 8, 
2021. 
The situation in Venezuela continues 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13692 
with respect to the situation in Ven-

SEC. 365. STOP MILITARIZING LAW ENFORCE-
MENT ACT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Under section 2576a of title 10, United 
States Code, the Department of Defense is 
authorized to provide excess property to 
local law enforcement agencies. The Defense 
Logistics Agency, administers such section 
by operating the Law Enforcement Support 
Office program. 
(2) New and used material, including mine- 
resistant 
ambush-protected 
vehicles 
and 
weapons determined by the Department of 
Defense to be ‘‘military grade’’ are trans-
ferred to Federal, Tribal, State, and local 
law enforcement agencies through the pro-
gram. 
(3) As a result local law enforcement agen-
cies, including police and sheriff’s depart-
ments, are acquiring this material for use in 
their normal operations. 
(4) As a result of the wars in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, military equipment purchased 
for, and used in, those wars has become ex-
cess property and has been made available 
for transfer to local and Federal law enforce-
ment agencies. 
(5) In Fiscal Year 2017, $504,000,000 worth of 
property was transferred to law enforcement 
agencies. 
(6) More than $6,800,000,000 worth of weap-
ons and equipment have been transferred to 
police organizations in all 50 States and four 
territories through the program. 
(7) In May 2012, the Defense Logistics 
Agency instituted a moratorium on weapons 
transfers through the program after reports 
of missing equipment and inappropriate 
weapons transfers. 
(8) Though the moratorium was widely 
publicized, it was lifted in October 2013 with-
out adequate safeguards. 
(9) On January 16, 2015, President Barack 
Obama issued Executive Order 13688 to better 
coordinate and regulate the federal transfer 
of military weapons and equipment to State, 
local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies. 
(10) In July, 2017, the Government Account-
ability Office reported that the program’s in-
ternal controls were inadequate to prevent 
fraudulent applicants’ access to the program. 
(11) On August, 28, 2017, President Donald 
Trump rescinded Executive Order 13688 de-
spite a July 2017 Government Accountability 
Office report finding deficiencies with the 
administration of the 1033 program. 
(12) As a result, Federal, State, and local 
law enforcement departments across the 
country are eligible again to acquire free 
‘‘military-grade’’ weapons and equipment 
that could be used inappropriately during po-
licing efforts in which people and taxpayers 
could be harmed. 
(13) The Department of Defense categorizes 
equipment eligible for transfer under the 1033 
program 
as 
‘‘controlled’’ 
and 
‘‘un-con-
trolled’’ equipment. ‘‘Controlled equipment’’ 
includes weapons, explosives such as flash- 
bang grenades, mine-resistant ambush-pro-
tected vehicles, long-range acoustic devices, 
aircraft capable of being modified to carry 
armament that are combat coded, and si-
lencers, among other military grade items. 
(b) LIMITATION ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
TRANSFER OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TO LOCAL 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 2576a of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(A) in subsection (a)— 
(i) 
in 
paragraph 
(1)(A), 
by 
striking 
‘‘counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border 
security activities’’ and inserting ‘‘counter-
terrorism’’; and 
(ii) in paragraph (2), by striking ‘‘, the Di-
rector of National Drug Control Policy,’’; 
(B) in subsection (b)— 
(i) in paragraph (5), by striking ‘‘and’’ at 
the end; 
(ii) in paragraph (6), by striking the period 
and inserting a semicolon; and 
(iii) by adding at the end the following new 
paragraphs:

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
1280. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 3 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, last summer, millions 
of Americans all across the country 
took to the streets to demand funda-
mental change in the culture of law en-
forcement and to call for meaningful 
accountability for officers who commit 
misconduct. 
The catalyst for these protests was 
the tragic and brutal death of George 
Floyd. None of us can forget the image 
of that officer’s knee pinned to his 
neck for nearly 8 agonizing minutes, or 
the sound of his anguished pleas of ‘‘I 
can’t breathe’’ that were ignored until 
his final breath was taken from him. 
After his death, the world awoke to 
daily indignities, and sometimes the 
brutality, that too many people—dis-
proportionately Black, Latinx, and in-
digenous people, people living in pov-
erty, and people with disabilities—face 
in their interactions with law enforce-
ment throughout the country. 
We value and respect the many brave 
and honorable police officers who put 
their lives on the line every day to pro-
tect us and our communities. We know 
that most law enforcement officers do 
their jobs with dignity, selflessness, 
and honor, and they are deserving of 
our respect and gratitude for all they 
do to keep us safe. But we must also 
acknowledge that there are too many 
exceptions. 
The reality for too many Americans, 
especially many Black Americans, is 
that police officers are perceived as a 
threat to their liberties; to their dig-
nity; and, too often, to their safety. 
Sadly, our country’s history of racism 
and racially motivated violence con-
tinues to haunt our Nation. 
We see it in the rates of COVID 
deaths, in our system of mass incarcer-
ation, and in the vast chasm of eco-
nomic inequality, all of which fall dis-
proportionately on the backs of Afri-
can Americans. And we see it in the 
harassment and excessive force that 
many people of color routinely experi-
ence by law enforcement. 
That is why we must act today. The 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
would allow for meaningful account-
ability in cases of police misconduct. It 
also effectively bans choke holds, ends 
racial and religious profiling, ends no- 
knock warrants in drug cases, and lim-
its the militarization of local policing. 
It encourages departments to meet a 
gold standard in training and other 
best practices to reduce police bias and 
violence. It requires significant data 
collection, including the first-ever na-
tional database on police-misconduct 
incidents to prevent the movement of 
dangerous officers from department to 
department. 
In addition, this legislation creates a 
process to reimagine how public safety 
could work in a truly equitable and 
just way in each community. 
Last summer, within weeks of the 
protests that galvanized the Nation, 
the House passed the legislation before 
us today. Unfortunately, the pleas for 
justice that rang out in the streets fell 
on deaf ears in the Senate. 
Since then, over 600 more people— 
disproportionately people of color— 
have been killed by law enforcement 
officers. 
The time for action is now. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BASS) for crafting this bold, 
yet responsible, legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER), a retired police 
officer. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1280, the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
With something as important as po-
lice reform, it is important to garner 
many perspectives. The JUSTICE Act, 
legislation Senator SCOTT and I intro-
duced, is a product of my perspective 
as a law enforcement officer from Min-
nesota and Senator SCOTT’s perspective 
as a Black man from South Carolina. 
The JUSTICE Act increases body 
cameras and implements duty to inter-
vene and deescalation training. It im-
proves hiring and recruitment prac-
tices. It reinvigorates the principles of 
community policing to rebuild the re-
lationships between law enforcement 
officers and the communities that they 
serve. 
The JUSTICE Act, which received bi-
partisan support last Congress, in-
cludes several critical provisions that 
are supported by Democrats: the Wal-
ter Scott Notification Act, the Na-
tional Criminal Justice Commission 
Act, and the Closing the Law Enforce-
ment Consent Loophole Act. It even in-
cludes legislation that Vice President 
HARRIS introduced, the Justice for Vic-
tims of Lynching Act. 
Unfortunately, we are not consid-
ering the JUSTICE Act today. We are, 
instead, once again, exploring political 
gamesmanship through H.R. 1280. 
Now, when we voted on this legisla-
tion last year, the Democrats knew it 
was dead upon passage, but my good 
friends and I in the Problem Solvers 
Caucus decided that this conversation 
was too important to let go. So we 
worked for months with Representa-
tives from both sides of the aisle, with 
Representatives 
from 
the 
Congres-
sional Black Caucus, with Representa-
tives from law enforcement and legal 
backgrounds, on areas where we could 
find compromise between the Justice 
in Policing Act and my bill, the JUS-
TICE Act. 
We discussed no-knock warrants, the 
1033 program, use of force, record re-
tention, and so much more. We were 
making such great headway. I truly be-
lieved that we could have put together 
a bipartisan package of reforms for our 
American communities that have been 
calling for change. 
Unfortunately, the other side walked 
away. As the election drew near, the 
priorities of my Democratic colleagues 
shifted. Their fight to retain power be-
came more important than providing 
police reform for the American people. 
So now we are here again, Mr. Speak-
er, to vote on the exact same bill with-
out a single change; a bill that has zero

input from Republicans, zero input or 
support from our law enforcement com-
munity. And I will repeat that. Zero 
input or support from our law enforce-
ment community. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
bill that will, no doubt, make our com-
munities less safe. We all want police 
reform and we all want change, but 
until such time as we work together, 
this legislation is just another mes-
saging bill from my Democrat col-
leagues. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BASS), the chief sponsor of 
this legislation. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago 
today, Rodney King was viciously beat-
en by police officers in Los Angeles. It 
would be the first time the world would 
witness what African Americans had 
been organizing, marching, and trying 
to change for over 100 years. 
Personally, I was hopeful that once 
everyone saw what happens in Black 
communities, 
policing 
in 
America 
would change. I was certain no one 
would deny what they saw with their 
own eyes and that the officers would be 
convicted. But they were acquitted. 
Some were even hired by other police 
departments. 
The sad truth was, when people told 
their stories of abuse or even murder at 
the hands of police officers, they were 
simply not believed. The story was al-
ways the same: I was in fear of my life. 
I thought they had a gun. The person 
was resisting arrest. The individual at-
tempted to assault me. 
That is all that was needed for the 
beating or murder to be discounted, 
dismissed. The individuals’ lives had 
little value. 
Even children. These are children 
here. This is an 8-year-old, a 10-year- 
old, a mother, and another child placed 
on the ground because the mother was 
suspected of stealing a car. 
Several years after Rodney King’s 
beating, cell phone cameras were in-
vented. It has taken technology and ac-
tive citizen involvement to document 
and expose this reality. And now there 
are many tapes, many examples of in-
dividuals being shot and killed by offi-
cers, yet transformation of policing in 
America has still not happened. 
Passing the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act will be a critical first 
step—just a first step—to transform 
policing in America. The bill raises the 
standards for policing and holds those 
officers accountable who fail to uphold 
the ethic of protecting and serving 
their communities. 
b 1830 
Now, I know that change is difficult, 
but I am certain that police officers 
who risk their lives every day are con-
cerned about their profession, and they 
don’t work in an environment where 
they are chastised for intervening 
when they see a fellow officer abuse a 
citizen or use deadly force when it is 
not necessary. And I am certain that 
police officers want to make sure that 
they are trained in the best practices 
in policing. 
To support officers, this legislation 
will create the first-ever national ac-
creditation standards for the operation 
of police departments, set national 
standards for officers, and establish 
best practices in training, hiring, dees-
calation 
strategies, 
and 
bystander 
duty. 
For example, if officers had better 
training, maybe they would understand 
that just because someone can verbally 
express ‘‘I can’t breathe,’’ does not 
mean they are faking and the officer 
can continue to press on the person’s 
chest, back, or neck. And despite our 
best intentions, there will be some offi-
cers who cross over the line. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why this bill 
also includes strong accountability 
measures, both as a matter of simple 
justice, and to keep unfit officers off 
the street. A profession where you have 
the power to kill should be a profession 
that requires highly trained officers 
who are accountable to the public. 
That is what this bill accomplishes. 
Police officers are the first to say it 
is unfair that they are not trained to 
be social workers or healthcare pro-
viders. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, the Justice 
in Policing Act reinvests in our com-
munities. 
If this legislation had been the law of 
the land several years ago, Eric Garner 
and George Floyd would be alive today, 
because the bill bans choke holds. 
If the bill had been law last year, 
Breonna Taylor would not have been 
shot to death in her sleep, because no- 
knock warrants for drug offenses would 
have been illegal. 
And if a national registry had been in 
effect, it would have been revealed that 
the 
officer 
who 
killed 
12-year-old 
Tamir Rice— 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS), the ranking member 
of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland 
Security Subcommittee. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budg-
et Office confirmed earlier this week 
that the Justice in Policing Act con-
tains an unfunded mandate by requir-
ing onerous data collection reporting 
from State and local law enforcement. 
This includes granular data collection 
on such basic law enforcement activi-
ties, like traffic stops. CBO estimates 
that this unfunded mandate placed on 
State and local law enforcement will 
cost several hundred million dollars. 
The consequences of H.R. 1280 are 
clear. It will drain resources away from 
important public safety activities. In-
stead, law enforcement officers will 
have to spend their time reporting data 
to Washington, D.C., from behind a 
desk. Make no mistake. This bill 
defunds the police. 
Additionally, any Member who is op-
posed to defunding the police should be 
opposing this bill. This legislation will 
also lower the mens rea standard when 
charging an officer with criminal mis-
conduct. It removes qualified immu-
nity, which will result in an ineffectual 
police force and leave our communities 
vulnerable to crime, and it also se-
verely limits the Department of De-
fense’s 1033 program. 
Mr. Speaker, but make no mistake, 
regardless of whatever else you may 
feel about this bill, this bill defunds po-
lice. We can never forget that. If you 
oppose defunding the police, you should 
be opposing this bill, like I am. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
tragic death of George Floyd has awak-
ened the Nation, the world. 
Last summer, in response to a call 
for action from righteous protestors 
across the Nation, we had to stand up. 
And we know that 8 minutes and 46 sec-
onds are printed and imprinted in the 
brains of those around the world. There 
is no defunding of the police. It is 
standing up the police and the commu-
nity. 
Today, we are honored that the 
George Floyd family did not turn to 
bitterness, but they turned to justice. 
Their parents, Larcenia and George; 
his daughter, Gianna; his siblings, 
Philonise, Zsa Zsa Williams, LaTonya 
Floyd, Rodney Floyd, Bridgett Floyd, 
Terrence Floyd, and a nephew, Brandon 
Williams. 
We know that we will be ending ra-
cial profiling now. We know that we 
will have qualified immunity for jus-
tice in the courts. We know that there 
will be training on racial bias. We will 
ban no-knock. We will ban choke holds. 
We will make sure that we end the ra-
cial profiling that caused George to 
come out of a grocery store and have 
someone’s knee on his neck for 8 min-
utes and 46 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, the world has stood up 
and justice is about to be rained on us. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, as an original co-
sponsor of the legislation, and the author of 
several of its key legislative provisions, I rise 
in strong and enthusiastic support of H.R. 
1280, the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act 
of 2021, which marks a defining turning point 
in our country. 
Let me say at the outset, Mr. Speaker, that 
any questions that there continues to exist 
today racial double-standards, disparities, and 
system racism in policing and the administra-
tion of justice were conclusively laid to rest by

what social scientists would regard as a ‘‘nat-
ural experiment’’ that took place in Wash-
ington, D.C., beginning in the summer and cul-
minating with the January 6, 2021, insurrection 
and siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump 
seditionists incited by the 45th President of the 
United States. 
Mass protests and political rallies took place 
in Washington, D.C., started May 29, 2020, 
four days after George Floyd died in Min-
nesota after a Minneapolis police officer 
kneeled on his neck for more than eight min-
utes. 
By the millions, Americans took to the 
streets in protest to affirm that no longer will 
the people of this country tolerate or acqui-
esce in horrible policing practices that include 
excessive and unnecessary uses of lethal 
force that has diminished community trust of 
policing practices across the country and has 
angered and terrified communities of color 
who are overwhelmingly and disproportion-
ately its innocent victims. 
Within days of the demonstrations, U.S. At-
torney General Bill Barr announced that mul-
tiple law enforcement agencies, including the 
National Guard, Secret Service and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, would ‘‘flood the 
zone’’ in D.C. 
Thousands of law enforcement officials, 
armed with tear gas, rubber bullets and fire-
arms were deployed to protect the city. 
Hundreds of people were arrested, D.C. po-
lice records show. 
More than 300 were arrested on June 1, 
2020, the day Attorney General Barr ordered 
law enforcement to forcefully clear peaceful 
protesters from a perimeter near the White 
House, making room for President Trump to 
pose for cameras while waving a Bible in front 
of St. John’s Episcopal Church. 
It was the largest number of arrests re-
corded for any day during the summer of 
events. 
Across the nation, law enforcement made 
an estimated 14,000 arrests in 49 U.S. cities 
during anti-racism protests in the summer of 
2020, according to the Washington Post. 
Following the November 3, 2020, election of 
Joe Eiden and running mate KAMALA HARRIS, 
large groups of Trump supporters held rallies 
in the city, where they clashed with counter- 
protesters. 
Police made 20 arrests during the so-called 
Million MAGA March on November 14, 2020, 
an event in which Trump-supporters, including 
White nationalists, far-right extremist groups, 
and conservative politicians gathered in D.C. 
to protest the election results. 
And, incredibly, only 61 arrests were made 
of rioters, who were overwhelming white and 
who used violence, that stormed the Capitol 
on January 6, an attack that claimed the lives 
of at least six persons, injured hundreds of 
others, caused horrific damage to property 
and national treasures, and inflicted emotional 
scars that will not heal for generations. 
But most of these arrests are related to 
charges 
involving 
curfew 
violations—D.C. 
mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 6 p.m. cur-
few, though mobs had broken into the Capitol 
hours earlier, around 1:30 p.m. 
There were only four non-curfew-related ar-
rests, compared to 40 non-curfew-related ar-
rests during Black Lives Matter protests on 
June 1, 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, the horrifying killing of George 
Floyd on May 25, 2020 by a Minneapolis po-
lice office shocked and awakened the moral 
consciousness of the nation. 
Untold millions saw the terrifying last 8:46 of 
life drained from a Black man, George Floyd, 
taking his last breaths face down in the street 
with his neck under the knee of a police officer 
who, along with his three cohorts, was indif-
ferent to his cries for help and pleas that he 
‘‘can’t breathe.’’ 
In direct response, for past several months 
civil protests against police brutality have oc-
curred nightly in cities large and small all 
across the nation. 
These protests were a direct reaction to the 
horrific killing of George Floyd but are most 
motivated by a deep-seated anger and frustra-
tion to the separate and unequal justice Afri-
can Americans receive at the hands of too 
many law enforcement officers. 
The civil disobedience witnessed nightly in 
the streets of America were also in memory of 
countless acts of the inequality and cruelty vis-
ited upon young African American men and 
women no longer with us in body but forever 
with us in memory. 
Beloved souls like Breanna Taylor in Louis-
ville, Kentucky; Eric Garner and Sean Bell in 
New York City; 12-year old Tamir Rice in 
Cleveland; and Michael Brown in Ferguson, 
Missouri. 
They remember the senseless killings as 
well of Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin by 
self-appointed vigilantes. 
Stephon Clark, was an unarmed 22-year-old 
African American male from Sacramento, Cali-
fornia, who was shot 23 times and killed by 
two uniformed members of the Sacramento 
Police Department on Sunday afternoon, 
March 18, 2018, in his grandmother’s back-
yard, leaving behind two small children be-
cause police officers claim that he had a gun 
but no weapon was found at the scene, only 
a cell phone. 
In August 2019, Elijah McClain, a 23-year- 
old African American man, was simply listen-
ing to music while walking home from a con-
venience store when he was stopped without 
basis by officers of the Aurora, Colorado Po-
lice Department, put into a carotid hold and 
given multiple doses of ketamine, which 
caused cardiac arrest from which he fell into 
a coma and died three days later. 
And the continuing need for their activism 
was reflected in the recent outrage, which 
began on June 12, 2020, and ended in the 
senseless slaughter of Rayshard Brooks, who 
was simply sleeping in his car at a local 
Wendy’s restaurant, by a uniformed officer of 
the Atlanta Police Department. 
It was reflected again on August 23, 2020, 
when a Kenosha Police Department officer 
shot Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old black man, 
in the back seven times—yes seven—as he 
attempted to enter his SUV where three of his 
young sons were in the back seat. 
We know the pain and heartbreak in my 
home state of Texas and the City of Houston 
where Robbie Tolan’s promising Major League 
Baseball was career was cut short after being 
shot by Bellaire Police Department officer in 
the front yard of his parents’ home. 
And Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old African 
American female who was arrested after a 
traffic stop just outside of Houston, Texas, and 
found dead in a Waller County jail cell three 
days later. 
Or Pamela Turner, an unarmed 44-year old 
African American mother of three who suffered 
from paranoid schizophrenia, who was killed 
outside her home in Baytown, Texas, by an 
officer of the Baytown Police Department, on 
Monday, May 13, 2019, the day after Mother’s 
Day. 
Or Jordan Baker, an unarmed 26-year-old 
African American male from Houston, Texas, 
who was shot to death by an off-duty uni-
formed member of the Houston Police Depart-
ment in the parking lot of a Harris County 
shopping mall on January 16, 2014. 
Or Danny Ray Thomas, an unarmed 34- 
year-old African American male, who was shot 
to death by a uniformed officer of the Harris 
County Sheriffs Department on March 22, 
2018, in Houston, Texas. 
Indeed, the history goes back much further, 
past Amidou Diallo in New York City, past the 
Central Park Five, past Emmitt Till, past the 
racist abuse of law enforcement power during 
the struggle for civil rights and equal treat-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, the times we are in demand 
that action be taken and that is precisely what 
my colleagues in the Congressional Black 
Caucus, on this committee, and Congressional 
Democrats did in introducing H.R. 1280, the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020. 
And we are taking the next bold action 
today in voting to pass this legislation and 
send it to the Senate and on to the White 
House for presidential signature and enact-
ment. 
I support this bold legislation not just as a 
senior member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, who also served on the House Work-
ing Group on Police Strategies, but also a 
mother of a young African American male who 
knows the anxiety that African American moth-
ers feel until they can hug their sons and 
daughters who return home safely, and on be-
half of all those relatives and friends who 
grieve over the loss a loved one whose life 
and future was wrongly and cruelly interrupted 
or ended by mistreatment at the hands of the 
police. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 
2021 is designed to destroy the pillars of sys-
temic racism in policing practices that has vic-
timized communities of color, and especially 
African Americans for decades, is overdue, 
too long overdue. 
This legislation puts the Congress of the 
United States on record against racial profiling 
in policing and against the excessive, unjusti-
fied, and discriminatory use of lethal and force 
by law enforcement officers against persons of 
color. 
The legislation means no longer will employ-
ment of practices that encourage systemic 
mistreatment of persons because of their race 
be ignored or tolerated. 
With our vote today to pass the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, the gov-
ernment of the United States is declaring firm-
ly, forcefully, and unequivocally that Black 
Lives Matter. 
It is true all lives matter, they always have. 
But that Black lives matter too, and in so 
many other areas of civic life, this nation has 
not always lived up to its promise but that the 
promise is worthy of fulfilling. 
Every African American parent, and every 
African America child, knows all too well ‘The 
Talk’ and the importance of abiding by the 
rules for surviving interactions with the police. 
While many police officers take this respon-
sibility seriously and strive to treat all persons

equally and with respect, their efforts are too 
often undermined by some of their colleagues 
who abuse the enormous trust and confidence 
placed in them. 
And systemically racist systems and prac-
tices left in place can corrupt even the most 
virtuous police officers. 
So, the most important criminal justice re-
forms needed to improve the criminal justice 
system are those that will increase public con-
fidence and build trust and mutual respect be-
tween law enforcement and the communities 
they swear an oath and are willing to risk their 
lives to protect and serve. 
That is the overriding purpose and aim of 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 
2021, which contains numerous provisions to 
weed out and eliminate systemic racism in po-
lice practices. 
Specifically, this legislation holds police ac-
countable in our courts by: 
Amending the mens rea requirement in fed-
eral law (18 U.S.C. Section 242) to prosecute 
police misconduct from ‘‘willfulness’’ to a 
‘‘recklessness’’ standard; 
Reforming qualified immunity so that individ-
uals are not barred from recovering damages 
when police violate their constitutional rights; 
Incentivizing state attorneys general to con-
duct pattern and practice investigations and 
improving the use of pattern and practice in-
vestigations at the federal level by granting the 
Department of Justice Civil Rights Division 
subpoena power; 
Incentivizing states to create independent 
investigative structures for police involved 
deaths; and 
Creating best practices recommendations 
based on the Obama 21st Century Policing 
Task force. 
As recognized by scholars at Cato—the 
conservative think tank Cato—the time has 
come to abolish qualified immunity. 
According to Cato, ‘‘qualified immunity is a 
legally baseless judicial invention’’ that has 
‘‘proven unworkable as a matter of judicial 
doctrine,’’ and ‘‘routinely denies justice to the 
victims of egregious misconduct and under-
mines public accountability across the board, 
especially for members of law enforcement.’’ 
I am particularly pleased that the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act includes the End 
Racial Profiling Now Act, which I introduced to 
ban the pernicious practice of racial profiling. 
In addition, I am proud that this legislation 
includes as Title I, Subtitle B, the bipartisan 
and bicameral George Floyd Law Enforcement 
Trust and Integrity Act, which I introduced with 
Congressman JASON CROW of Colorado in the 
116th Congress as H.R. 7100. 
This legislation provides incentives for local 
police organizations to voluntarily adopt per-
formance-based standards to ensure that inci-
dents of deadly force or misconduct will be 
minimized through appropriate management 
and training protocols and properly inves-
tigated, should they occur. 
The legislation directs the Department of 
Justice to work cooperatively with independent 
accreditation, law enforcement and commu-
nity-based organizations to further develop 
and refine the accreditation standards and 
grants conditional authority to the Department 
of Justice to make grants to law enforcement 
agencies for the purpose of obtaining accredi-
tation from certified law enforcement accredi-
tation organizations. 
As I have stated many times, direct action 
is vitally important but to be effective it must 
be accompanied by political, legislative, and 
governmental action, which is necessary be-
cause the strength and foundation of demo-
cratic government rests upon the consent and 
confidence of the governed. 
Effective enforcement of the law and admin-
istration of justice requires the confidence of 
the community that the law will be enforced 
impartially and that all persons are treated 
equally without regard to race or ethnicity or 
religion or national origin. 
As the great jurist Judge Learned Hand 
said: ‘‘If we are to keep our democracy, there 
must be one commandment: thou shalt not ra-
tion justice.’’ 
Equal justice is the proud promise America 
makes to all persons; the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act of 2021 will help make that 
promise a lived reality for African Americans, 
who have not ever known it to be true in the 
area of community-police relations. 
And when Black Lives Matter, then and only 
then can it truthfully be said that all lives mat-
ter. 
Finally, let me say a few words in memory 
of the man whose sacrifice of his inalienable 
right to life has galvanized the world and 
awakened the sleeping giant of moral de-
cency. 
Mr. Speaker, let me pay tribute to the per-
son for whom this legislation is named and to 
his family. 
George Floyd, also known lovingly as ‘‘Big 
Floyd,’’ ‘‘Perry,’’ or ‘‘The Gentle Giant,’’ loved 
life, his family, friends, and community and 
throughout his life used his love of sports and 
music to leave a positive impact on this world. 
Mr. Speaker, rather than giving in to bitter-
ness and hate, the family of George Floyd has 
channeled the pain and heartbreak of the trag-
ic loss of their beloved George into the cre-
ation of a force for good: The George Floyd 
Memorial Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non- 
profit, to promote global awareness about ra-
cial injustice and provide opportunities for oth-
ers to contribute to the unification of our com-
munities and touch the world. 
Let me thank each member of the Floyd 
family and list them by name: his parents, 
Larcenia 
Jones-Floyd 
and 
George 
Perry 
Floyd, Sr.; his daughter, Gianna Floyd; his sib-
lings Philonise Floyd, Zsa Zsa Williams, 
LaTonya Floyd, Rodney Floyd, Bridget Floyd, 
Terrence Floyd; and nephew, Brandon ‘‘WOO’’ 
Williams. 
Mr. Speaker, in Acts 2:23 of the Scriptures 
it is written that ‘‘This man was handed over 
to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowl-
edge; and you with the help of wicked men, 
put him to death by nailing him to the cross.’’ 
Duty calls us to do improve the quality of 
policing in America. 
We cannot agitate for change one day and 
then allow things to remain the same, to allow 
wicked men to keep committing this crime 
against humanity. 
This behavior did not begin with George 
Floyd; there is a 400-year history here, from 
slave patrols, to Jim Crow to Bull Connor to 
the modern-day lynching of George Floyd by 
Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. 
But the good news is that right is on our 
side; God has stepped in. 
In John 1:46 it is said, ‘‘can anything good 
come out of Nazareth?’’ 
When he was growing up, I am sure there 
were people who saw George Floyd and 
asked can anything good come out of the 
Third Ward of Houston? 
We now know the answer is clearly yes. 
George Floyd was here in service to God’s 
divine plan. 
And as his daughter Gianna said, her 
Daddy changed the world. 
Thank you, George Floyd for what you have 
done for us, for helping us find our voice and 
our resolve. 
We will not let you down; we will finish the 
job. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentlewoman just said that there 
was no defunding of the police. I would 
just point out Democrat-controlled cit-
ies around the country: 
Austin, Texas, $150 million cut; 
Baltimore, Maryland, $22 million; 
Boston, $12 million; 
Burlington, $1 million; 
Columbus, $23 million; 
Denver, $55 million; 
Eureka, California, $1.2 million; 
Hartford, $2 million; 
Los Angeles, $175 million; 
Madison, Wisconsin, $2 million; 
Minneapolis, $8 million; 
New York, $1 billion; 
Norman, $865,000; 
Oakland, $14.6 million; 
Oklahoma City, $5.5 million; 
Philadelphia, $33 million; 
Portland, Oregon, $15 million; 
Salt Lake City, $5.3 million; 
San Francisco, $120 million; 
Seattle, $69 million; 
Washington, D.C., $15 million cut. 
That is what Democrats have done 
over the last year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS). 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 1280. 
I spent the last week talking to law 
enforcement officers in Utah. These 
men and women are heroes. They are 
good, honest officers who risk their 
lives every day to keep us safe. 
I asked them about H.R. 1280, and 
this is what they said: 
‘‘This will destroy public safety.’’ 
‘‘We haven’t done anything to earn 
this type of distrust.’’ 
‘‘This will push good law enforce-
ment out of the business.’’ 
‘‘Utah is an amazing place. We have 
the right people protecting us. Let’s 
keep them here.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, police reform is nec-
essary. We need to give officers the 
tools they need to fairly enforce the 
law. But this legislation paints a tar-
get on the back of every police officer 
in America. 
In Salt Lake City, we saw a 38 per-
cent increase in homicides. At the 
same time, Salt Lake cut $5.3 million 
from the police department’s budget. It 
should be no surprise that voluntary 
resignations doubled. This bill will 
make good officers flee the profession 
when we need them most. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats won’t say 
this, but this bill simply defunds the 
police. Not in Utah’s Fourth District; 
not now; not ever. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
simply point out that this bill does

not—all the cities that we talked 
about, it does not mention any cities. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act. 
I started my career as the legal ad-
viser to the Memphis Police Depart-
ment. There were many fine policemen, 
and most of them never used a choke 
hold, never used their gun, and oper-
ated admirably. Some did not. 
The disproportionate share that Afri-
can Americans have suffered from 
killings by police shows we need to act. 
You can’t think about George Floyd 
being choked with a knee and killed for 
8 minutes. You can’t think of Eric Gar-
ner being wrestled down like a prize 
trophy animal and killed in Staten Is-
land, or young Tamir Rice, shot with-
out an officer taking a second to think 
about it. 
Mr. Speaker, these deaths require us 
to act. This is not defund the police. 
This is reform the police and save 
human lives. We need to pass this bill 
today. We should have passed it 40 
years ago when I was a police attorney. 
Pass it now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in strong opposition to 
the efforts by you and your colleagues 
to defund our police. 
This week we will be voting on H.R. 
1280, the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act. This bill is named after a man 
who was murdered by a police officer. 
The officer responsible should have 
never been allowed to don a badge and 
act on behalf of the agency sworn to 
protect its citizens. He should and is 
being held accountable. 
Now, as a member of a first responder 
family, I can say definitively on behalf 
of our officers that there is absolutely 
nothing, nothing that a good cop hates 
more than a bad cop. And as the wife of 
a first responder, this issue could not 
be more personal to me. 
Mr. Speaker, my husband serves our 
local community as a firefighter and a 
SWAT medic for our local sheriff’s de-
partment. And next to me here today, 
you see one of his SWAT vests. 
This is the same vest that he wore 
for 14 hours while on a massive man-
hunt for a man who had just been re-
leased from prison, who promptly raped 
and killed his girlfriend. 
It is the same vest that he wore while 
responding to a man who had barri-
caded himself with weapons, threat-
ening to kill his own children. 
These are just some of the scenes 
that this vest and my husband have 
seen, like so many of our LEOs. But 
the real threat here is not the dan-
gerous situations that my husband has 
seen in protecting his community, it is 
the fact that this bill—and by exten-
sion, you, Mr. Speaker—want to take 
this vest off my husband’s back be-
cause, yes, what this bill does is take 
this kind of equipment off the backs of 
our men and women in uniform. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues who are considering voting for 
this bill: 
Are you waking up at 2 a.m. to re-
spond to a gruesome murder? 
Are you missing your children’s 
birthday parties to respond to gang 
shootings? 
There is absolutely room for us to 
improve. There is absolutely room and 
a necessity for us to do better. But the 
answer is not to defund the police. It is 
not the answer. What this bill ulti-
mately does is defund the police. 
You want a better trained, more re-
sponsive police force in your home-
town? Fully fund the police. You say 
this is a reform bill, and I say that is 
BS. 
Mr. Speaker, your own conference 
members have been advocating for the 
defunding of our local police officers, 
calling them names that I cannot and 
will not repeat here today. In fact, 
many of your members have made it a 
top priority of their platforms. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, George 
Floyd died under the knee of a police 
officer 302 days ago. In the time since 
then, 797 people—more than 21⁄2 every 
day—have died during encounters with 
law enforcement. 
Black Americans are 21⁄2
times as 
likely as White Americans to be killed 
by the police. Police use of force is now 
the sixth-leading cause of death for 
young Black men in this country. This 
cannot continue. It is time to address 
systemic racism in policing. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will begin to do 
that. It ends choke holds. It will hold 
bad officers accountable, combat racial 
profiling, and demilitarize police de-
partments. This bill is about ensuring 
accountability and restoring trust be-
tween law enforcement and their com-
munities. Both the police and the com-
munity deserve that and will benefit 
from it. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a co-
sponsor, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
And I would say, there has been a lot 
of discussion about defunding the po-
lice. The only party in this Chamber 
defunding the police are the Repub-
licans, who just voted against billions 
of dollars to support local and State 
government, first responders, police of-
ficers. We supported that. We are fund-
ing the police. They voted to defund it. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill restores rela-
tionships between the police and the 
community, and I urge its passage. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to this egregious, 
so-called police reform bill. The proc-
ess used to craft this bill is nonsense. 
In a normal functioning Congress, 
the Speaker would bring together Re-
publicans and Democrats to discuss 
ways to push needed police reforms. 
But in this dysfunctional Congress, we 
got a bill that strips our frontline po-
lice officers from qualified immunity, 
that will weaken and possibly destroy 
our communities’ police forces. 
Mr. Speaker, as mayor and sheriff of 
Miami-Dade County, and a former 
SWAT medic myself, I was actually re-
sponsible for ensuring my community 
was kept safe from lawlessness. I un-
derstand firsthand the importance of 
qualified immunity for police officers 
to carry out their jobs. 
Officers perform vital tasks requiring 
split-second decisions under intense 
circumstances. Taking away qualified 
immunity will lead to police officers 
not taking the decisive actions and 
rendering it impossible for them to do 
their job. Without this security, offi-
cers will resign and deplete our police 
force, leaving our communities—the 
very ones who need a strong police 
force the most—less safe and costing 
the lives of countless Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote against this dangerous 
bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to strongly support the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act and to 
say Black Lives Matter. 
I rise for Charleena Lyles, Che Tay-
lor, Manuel Ellis, Tommy Le, Tony 
McDade, George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, Eric Garner, Atatiana Jefferson, 
Ezell Ford, Tanisha Anderson, Tamir 
Rice, Walter Scott, Philando Castile, 
Gabriella Nevarez, Botham Jean. 
I rise for all of our Black siblings 
who have been killed by law enforce-
ment, because there are far too many 
to say all of their names. 
I rise for the Black Lives Matter 
protestors who were met with aggres-
sion, tear gas, and force while White 
domestic terrorists were met with none 
of these things. 
I rise to answer the call of millions of 
people led by Black voices who have 
taken to the streets demanding trans-
formative change. 
I rise because that change begins 
today by once again passing the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
b 1845 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. STEUBE). 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of our Nation’s law 
enforcement. Blessed are the peace-
makers for they will be called children 
of God. 
Mr. Speaker, since last summer, 
members of law enforcement have 
faced attacks and dangerous rhetoric, 
even from Members of this body. As of-
ficers put their lives on the line to pro-
tect all of us, our communities, and 
our families, we have seen nothing but

dangerous attempts from the left to 
defund, dismantle, and disband the po-
lice even as we stand here today, sur-
rounded by razor wire, the National 
Guard and increased police presence to 
protect you, but you don’t want them 
to protect our citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill would end 
qualified immunity. Qualified immu-
nity is only applicable when they fol-
low their training and protocol and 
protects officers from being personally 
sued for official actions. If we repeal 
qualified immunity, we will not find 
anyone willing to serve as police offi-
cers because they can be sued out of ev-
erything they own for doing their jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, if that is not enough, 
this bill would threaten our officers’ 
physical safety by denying them pro-
tective gear and equipment. The Demo-
crats and radical left are going to 
defund and dismantle departments and 
take away officers’ liability protection 
for doing their job. Then they are going 
to take away their physical protection 
from harm. We will be lucky to have a 
police force in America in 10 years. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
proud of our many officers in Georgia’s 
Sixth Congressional District, here in 
the Capitol, and those nationwide who 
do all that they can to keep our fami-
lies safe. 
They have the trust of their commu-
nities and, as a result, are better at en-
suring everyone’s safety. These officers 
know the people that they serve. They 
see them as brothers, sisters, and 
neighbors. They serve with honor and 
respect the dignity of every citizen. 
This bill is about making sure that 
every officer and every department is 
held to the same standard as has been 
set by the officers in my own district. 
Mr. Speaker, by passing the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act, we in-
vest in our departments, end harmful 
profiling, and provide grants to com-
munities finding new and innovative 
ways to improve safety. 
This bill ensures all of our police offi-
cers have the resources to become our 
very best police officers, and that they 
are all working to make sure that 
every single one of us is safer. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
whenever the left takes control of local 
law enforcement, the result is predict-
able and catastrophic. They act to 
defund the police, deliberately with-
hold police protection from law-abiding 
shopkeepers and citizens, declare sanc-
tuaries for criminal illegal aliens, de-
cline to charge criminals, and prevent 
law-abiding citizens from protecting 
themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, we are now suffering 
the result: skyrocketing homicides, 
shootings, and other violent crimes, 
preying most of all upon the decent 
citizens of our inner cities. Now, after 
their summer of love and lawlessness, 
look at the results. Their storefronts 
are boarded up. Their buildings are 
burned out. Their streets are increas-
ingly surrendered to the lawless. 
Frankly, the Democrats in Congress 
that have applauded these policies 
would not be my first choice to micro-
manage every police department across 
our country as this bill does; just say-
ing. 
The ultimate target of the left is not 
isolated abuses by law enforcement of-
ficers but, rather, law enforcement 
itself. As we can now see, without law 
enforcement, there is no law. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, no mat-
ter how many times the other side says 
that this bill will defund the police, it 
does not make it true. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it would be 
an irresponsible policy to defund the 
police. We are not for that. 
Hear me. You can say it over and 
over and over again. It will be a lie. No 
matter how well it serves your polit-
ical purposes, it will be a lie. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this legislation. I want to thank 
Representative BASS and members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus for 
their leadership last year and now. I 
also want to thank my friend, Chair-
man NADLER, and the Judiciary Com-
mittee for their hard work. 
I am proud to be an original sponsor. 
If I thought this defunded the police, I 
would not be for it. Now, that won’t af-
fect you and your debate, I understand 
that, any more than it affected you in 
recognizing the legitimacy of the Pres-
idential election. 
I am proud to be an original sponsor. 
Mr. Speaker, in June of last year, the 
House passed this bill because we rec-
ognized that something had to change. 
Change could not wait. Change waited 
too long in the Jim Crow South. 
Change has waited too long throughout 
this country—North, East, West, and 
South. 
Mr. Speaker, when we mournfully 
say 
the 
names 
of 
George 
Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Michael 
Brown, Philando Castile, Freddie Gray, 
with a list that goes on and on and on 
and on, enough, my colleagues, enough. 
We must change the psychology of 
how we treat people. I don’t mean po-
lice alone. I mean all of us, but all of us 
don’t carry guns. All of us have not 
been given extraordinary authority by 
the public we serve. Because we give 
certain people in this country extraor-
dinary authority to take our freedom 
away and, yes, to take our lives away, 
we must ensure accountability for the 
use of that power, just as the voters 
ought to ensure accountability for the 
power that they give to us. 
When we hear about African Amer-
ican parents having to teach their sons 
how to act during encounters with po-
lice so that they, too, don’t become 
victims, it is time for change. When we 
feel the energy of many millions of 
Americans of every race, every faith, 
and every age taking peacefully to the 
streets in protest against injustice, we 
know that change must come now. 
I know how you lament the use of vi-
olence. I saw that on January 6. 
Mr. Speaker, peaceful demonstra-
tions, Martin Luther King was locked 
up. Rosa Parks was locked up. For a 
crime? Of course, Parks sat in the front 
of the bus. That was illegal. As King 
said, an illegal law ought not to be 
obeyed. 
Mr. Speaker, they paid the con-
sequences. They had the courage and 
fortitude to do that. 
That is why we took action last year, 
passing the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act. This legislation addresses 
police choke holds like the kind that 
took George Floyd’s life. Stand if you 
can justify that action. 
Mr. Speaker, it addresses no-knock 
warrants like the one that led to the 
tragic 
and 
preventable 
death 
of 
Breonna Taylor. It would condition 
Federal funding and resources to police 
departments on ending racial profiling. 
Content of character, did we not learn 
that lesson? It is not the color of your 
skin, the cut of the cloth you wear, or 
the part in your hair. 
Mr. Speaker, we ask them to follow 
best practices with that power and au-
thority we have given them, best prac-
tices in police training that help en-
sure the rights of those who encounter 
police, as well as the safety of all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill also brings jus-
tice to victims and their families by fa-
cilitating, 
under 
appropriate 
cir-
cumstances, their ability to seek re-
dress of grievances. 
This bill is not only intended to pro-
tect people who encounter the police, 
but it is meant to help keep police safe 
as well, to help them do the difficult 
job of keeping their communities safe. 
Mr. Speaker, there is not a Member 
of this body, I think I can safely say, 
who has attended more frequently the 
annual National Law Enforcement Offi-
cers Memorial Fund ceremony. I am 
local, but I dare say that no Member in 
this body has attended that more fre-
quently, been more supportive of law 
enforcement, or been more supportive 
of my local sheriffs and police depart-
ments. They are critically important. 
Of course, we don’t want to defund 
them. We have to have a safe society if 
democracy is going to prevail. That is 
why we have law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard from so 
many law enforcement officials who 
are deeply concerned about misconduct 
and racial bias in policing, just as each 
one of us ought to be concerned about 
a politician who commits a crime. 
Why? It reflects on all of us. All of 
those politicians are crooks. Somebody 
out there is saying amen. 
That is why this is important, be-
cause there are so many hundreds of 
thousands of honest, hardworking, cou-
rageous, dedicated police officers, sher-
iffs, and constables in this country.

March 3, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, most police officers are 
good and decent men and women, serv-
ing with honor. They want to know 
that their ranks are free from those 
who would apply bias and sow mistrust 
that endangers their and their col-
leagues’ safety. This is just the begin-
ning of a larger effort to reform polic-
ing, which will require the Senate and 
White House to work with us to ensure 
that victims of misconduct and their 
families get the justice they deserve, 
while police departments have the sup-
port, the funding, if you will, they need 
to keep our communities safe. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, when we passed 
this bill last year, the Republican-con-
trolled Senate refused even to consider 
it. They were in charge. They put no 
bill of their own on the floor. I apolo-
gize. I retract that. Mr. JORDAN is cor-
rect. 
Now, however, with this Democratic 
Senate majority, I hope I can see ac-
tion, work with Senator SCOTT, and 
come to a resolution, because this 
problem will not go away if we don’t 
help it. We will not save lives if we 
don’t act. 
Mr. Speaker, I know that this is a top 
priority for Senate Democrats, as well 
as for President Biden and Vice Presi-
dent Harris. So, I hope that we will not 
only see the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act pass the House today but 
also be signed into law this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a necessary bill 
to respond to a crisis throughout our 
country, certainly not by every mem-
ber of law enforcement, but by the mi-
nority of law enforcement officers, just 
as my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle are a credit to the service in this 
House, not all, but the overwhelming 
majority. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s pass this bill. Let’s 
act for justice. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair and not to each 
other. 
b 1900 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the majority leader just 
said: Enough, my colleagues, enough. 
I couldn’t agree more. 
Last summer, Democrats called for 
unrest in the streets. They raised bail 
money for rioters. They called antifa a 
myth. They voted and pushed for 
defunding the police all across this 
country. 
Guess what? When you call for unrest 
in the streets while there is unrest in 
the streets, guess what happens? 
You get more unrest in the streets. 
When you raise money to bail out ri-
oters, guess what happens? 
You get more rioters. 
When you call antifa a myth, guess 
what happens? 
You get more attacks on property 
and on people. 
Guess what also happens when you 
call for defunding the police? 
You get more crime. 
And when you fail to condemn vio-
lence—all violence, whether it happens 
on January 6 or last summer—you get 
more violence. 
Everyone understands that. Everyone 
should understand that, but it seems 
Democrats don’t. 
We had a bill in the House, just like 
Senator SCOTT’s bill, and Representa-
tive STAUBER was the sponsor. Last 
year, when we had a markup, we of-
fered 12 amendments in committee. 
They wouldn’t take any of them. Some 
of the amendments, the Democrats ac-
tually supported them. But nope, nope, 
got to be this bill. 
They didn’t want to work with us to 
deal with the real concern, because we 
all know what happened to Mr. Floyd 
was as wrong as wrong could be. We 
were willing to work, but, no, they 
wouldn’t take any of our amendments 
and said the things they said last sum-
mer. We should work together on this, 
but they don’t want to. They don’t 
want to do it. 
They want their own bill. They don’t 
want Republicans to vote for it. They 
want to play politics. We would actu-
ally like to solve the problem. We 
would actually like to solve the prob-
lem. 
You know what else happens when 
you call for defunding the police? 
The police retire. There is a 72 per-
cent increase in retirement of police 
officers in New York City alone. Think 
of what it is like around the country. 
That is what happens when you send 
the message that Democrats sent all 
last summer. It is wrong. We shouldn’t 
stand for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, Officer Tif-
fany-Victoria Enriquez, Officer Kaulike 
Kalama, 
Sheriff 
Sheldon 
Gordon 
Whiteman, 
Officer 
Katherine 
Mary 
Thyne, I could go on and on 113 times 
with the names of law enforcement of-
ficers who died in the line of duty, who 
were killed last year in 2020—113. 
And we are on the floor of the House 
of Representatives with a bill gutting 
the qualified immunity that helps pro-
tect our law enforcement officers with-
out so much as a hearing, without so 
much as coming back to talk to us and 
work with us since last June. 
Why? 
Because this is all political. This is 
all political. 
We talk about defunding. I am from 
Austin, Texas; $150 million cut from 
the police budget there. 
And what did my Democrat col-
leagues do last Friday? 
Jammed through $500 billion for 
State and local governments, funding 
the very Democratic cities that are 
gutting our law enforcement officers, 
taking away what they need to be able 
to exist. 
And with what happened in Austin, a 
50 percent increase in murder rate. We 
lost the greatest cadet class we had. 
This bill is a sham. We should oppose 
it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, no mat-
ter how many times Republicans may 
say the contrary, Democrats have 
never called for defunding the police. 
Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, we re-
spect every single officer who has died 
in the line of duty. 
The question is: Why don’t you re-
spect those Black and Latino individ-
uals who were shot in the back, choked 
to death, beaten nearly unconscious, or 
have a knee to the neck, strangling the 
life out of them for 8 minutes and 46 
seconds? Why don’t you respect them? 
That is what the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act is all about. 
We respect police officers, those who 
protect and serve; but we have a chal-
lenge with police violence, police bru-
tality. The police abuse of force cannot 
be denied, video after video after video. 
Don’t believe us, believe your own 
eyes. 
Thirty years ago, Rodney King was 
beaten on this very day, and we 
thought it would be different. But 30 
years later, nothing has changed in 
terms of accountability and reining in 
those officers who cross the line. 
It is time to pass the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, and do it now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
ignores the harm that anti-law enforce-
ment rhetoric and unchecked violence 
have inflicted on our communities and 
our police. 
Since last year, we have seen busi-
nesses and communities terrorized, 
burned, and looted by criminal gangs 
and thugs, while some elected officials 
justified 
the 
violence, 
called 
for 
defunding the police, and moved to tie 
the hands of law enforcement. In es-
sence, lawlessness prevailed and ac-
countability failed. This legislation 
doubles down on that failed policy. 
In my home State of Wisconsin, we 
watched city officials in Madison, Ke-
nosha, and Milwaukee stand by as vio-
lent rioters destroyed property, monu-
ments, shops, and livelihoods. Sheriffs 
in my home State tell me they are hav-
ing significant retention and recruiting 
issues. This will only exacerbate that. 
It is a back door to the misguided 
defund the police efforts. Defunding the 
police does not make the police safer. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill empowers 
criminals, while stripping cops of the 
tools they need to do their jobs and due 
process guaranteed to them by the 
Constitution. It exposes law enforce-
ment officers and their families to po-
tential retribution by criminals. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I, like so 
many 
in 
my 
community 
of 
Min-
neapolis, 
are 
still 
traumatized. 
I 
watched horrified for 8 minutes and 46 
seconds as George Floyd’s life was

taken from him, another innocent 
Black man murdered by the police in 
our community. 
Time and time again, we have wit-
nessed the people who are sworn to pro-
tect 
our 
communities 
abuse 
their 
power. My city is not an outlier, but, 
rather, an example of the inequalities 
our country has struggled with for cen-
turies. 
Brutality 
against 
unarmed 
Black men and women is not a new 
phenomenon. 
Today, we find ourselves at a cross-
road. Will we have the moral courage 
to pursue justice and secure meaning-
ful change? Or will we succumb to this 
moment? 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH). 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Ohio for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, here we go again: about 
to vote on a divisive bill being pushed 
through by the majority without any 
Republican input. Disguised as ac-
countability, this bill hinders law en-
forcement’s ability to do their jobs, 
limits the readiness of law enforce-
ment, and demonizes an entire profes-
sion for the actions of a few. 
A bill from my Minnesota colleague, 
Mr. STAUBER, a former police officer 
himself, accomplishes many of the 
aims of this bill before us today, and 
has bipartisan support from the stake-
holders involved; but Democrats re-
jected it, picking partisanship over 
real reform to help and improve law en-
forcement. 
We do not deny there is work to be 
done, but the path to getting it done is 
working together to ensure that law 
enforcement developed the necessary 
tools to keep our communities safe and 
protect the rights of people they serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ and to work on a bill that 
will really help law enforcement and 
the citizens. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, any 
man’s death diminishes me. We will 
never forget, the world will never for-
get, as we watched as a police officer 
knelt on George Floyd’s neck for more 
than 8 minutes. 
George Floyd cried out for his moth-
er, 
saying 
‘‘Mama, 
mama, 
mama, 
mama, mama, mama, mama, I can’t 
breathe. I love you. Tell my kids I love 
them. I am dead.’’ 
As he was murdered by an officer 
sworn to protect and serve, Americans 
of all races and backgrounds flooded 
the streets all across this Nation, de-
manding long overdue accountability 
so that no one has to live in fear of the 
police. 
They demanded that we recognize 
George Floyd’s death and the deaths of 
so many others at the hands of the po-
lice. These killings have left the Black 
community and, much more impor-
tantly, our entire community trauma-
tized and scared. Wounds cannot heal 
without accountability. 
This is not an anti-police bill. The 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is 
for Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Breonna 
Taylor, Elijah McClain, and so many 
more. 
Any man’s death diminishes me. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1280 
and defunding the police. 
When 
vandalism 
and 
violence 
plagued cities across the country last 
summer, our law enforcement officers 
were the thin blue line protecting us. 
The 
violence 
reached 
communities 
from New York City to Portland. It 
even hit places in my district, and we 
saw our local law enforcement act he-
roically. 
Unfortunately, as both the son and 
father of law enforcement officials, 
this bill is a step in the wrong direc-
tion. The bill substantially reduces due 
process for police officers, restricts ac-
cess to needed equipment, and makes it 
more difficult to get critical funding. 
Our law enforcement officers need 
more funding, not less. More funding 
will help our officers get additional 
training to deescalate conflicts and get 
more equipment to keep all parties 
safe. Instead of focusing on how we can 
help the police build trust in the com-
munities, this bill focuses on how we 
can take from the police. 
Clearly, the bill is designed to satisfy 
those that seek to defund and dis-
mantle the police. None of this bill 
serves to build trust between law en-
forcement and their communities. Like 
every occupation, law enforcement has 
bad apples that must be held account-
able. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from New York, 
the distinguished chair of the Judici-
ary Committee, for yielding and for his 
leadership in bringing this important 
legislation to the floor. 
I commend Congresswoman KAREN 
BASS for her great leadership in this 
important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, nearly 1 year ago, 
George Floyd gasped his last words, ‘‘I 
can’t breathe,’’ and ignited a nation-
wide reckoning on the racial injustice 
and police brutality in America. 
Americans from every corner of the 
country took to the streets to peace-
fully protest violence against Black 
Americans: waving Black Lives Matter 
flags, chanting the names of the mur-
dered, repeating George Floyd’s dying 
words, ‘‘I can’t breathe.’’ They turned 
their agony into action. 
But, tragically, despite these mass 
protests, the injustice, the killing, con-
tinues. Those protests were global. 
They were all over the world. 
Here, as Members of Congress, and as 
Americans, we cannot accept this epi-
demic of injustice. We cannot stay si-
lent when our most vulnerable and his-
torically marginalized communities— 
people of color, those living in poverty, 
Americans with disabilities—are being 
targeted and sometimes killed. 
That is why today the House will 
again pass the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act and send it to the Senate 
and the President’s desk, so that it can 
finally become the law of the land. 
b 1915 
I salute Congresswoman KAREN BASS, 
who has been relentless, persistent, and 
absolutely courageous in her leadership 
on this legislation. I thank the Con-
gressional Black Caucus and its chair-
person, JOYCE BEATTY; and Judiciary 
chair, JERRY NADLER. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act fundamentally transforms the cul-
ture of policing with strong, unprece-
dented reform. This legislation will not 
erase centuries of systemic racism and 
excessive policing in America. It will 
not bring back George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor—say her name, Breonna Tay-
lor—Ahmaud Arbery, or the countless 
other men and women who died or were 
senselessly injured. But it will take a 
tremendous step forward to stop the vi-
olence, stem the suffering, and start to 
build a healthier and better relation-
ship between law enforcement and 
communities that they protect. 
All of us here salute and are pro-
foundly grateful for our law enforce-
ment heroes. I grew up in a public serv-
ice family. My father, my whole life at 
home, was the mayor of Baltimore. My 
brother 
was 
mayor 
later, 
Thomas 
D’Alesandro, in Baltimore. They had a 
motto about the police: Be true to the 
men in blue. 
Of course, this was a long time ago. 
Be true to the men in blue. I was raised 
with that respect. 
But then, prayerfully, these people, 
our men and women—now men and 
women—in uniform, whether they are 
police or fire, but addressing police 
here, our first responders left home 
when they left to go to work, not 
knowing, and their families not know-
ing, if they would return home because 
they were risking their lives to save 
lives and to protect all of us. So it was 
with great prayerful gratitude to most 
of the men and women in blue that we, 
sadly, have to say that our apprecia-
tion for them cannot lapse into apathy 
or acceptance of actions that are fun-
damentally incompatible with the pur-
pose of policing. 
Of course, there is not anyone on our 
side of the aisle who has advocated any 
policy in this body to defund the po-
lice, contrary to misrepresentations 
that are coming forth. All of us here, 
again, salute and are profoundly grate-
ful for our law enforcement heroes. 
As the National Organization of 
Black Law Enforcement Executives 
writes: 
The passage of this act is paramount in 
achieving the fundamental principle of a po-
lice force that ‘‘protects and serves’’ every

citizen of their community with fairness, ac-
countability, and transparency in their ac-
tions. 
The Democratic Congress, together 
with the Biden-Harris administration, 
is committed to not only ensuring that 
this legislation becomes law, but to 
take further action to end violence and 
advance justice in America. Let us en-
sure that the passage of the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act is the 
first of many steps in this direction. 
The family of George Floyd, who 
came here when the bill was being re-
viewed by Chairman NADLER’s com-
mittee, asked me: Madam Speaker, will 
you name this bill for our brother? 
His brother asked that question. The 
gentleman remembers that day. We 
couldn’t be in the committee room be-
cause of COVID. 
I said: Only if you think it is worthy 
of your brother. 
I think of George Floyd at least once 
a day and sometimes more. 
Do you know why? 
Not just because of the sadness of it 
all, but I think of him because they tell 
us that, in order to be safe from 
COVID, we must wash our hands for 20 
seconds. So as I’m washing my hands 
for 20 seconds, after about 8 or 9 sec-
onds, I am thinking that this is taking 
forever; I can’t do this for 20 seconds; it 
takes too long. Then I think of George 
Floyd—8 minutes and 46 seconds. It is a 
long time. It is a long time, as Con-
gresswoman DEAN said, calling out for 
his mother and extending love to his 
family. 
Let us ensure that George’s brother, 
Philonise, when he said that George’s 
name means something; and that as his 
daughter, 
Gianna, 
said, 
‘‘Daddy 
changed the world,’’ with this legisla-
tion, let us take an important step in 
changing the world for George’s family, 
for all communities of color, for all 
Americans, and for the whole world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan vote in the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act, and I thank 
KAREN BASS, again, for her leadership. 
Madam Speaker, nearly one year ago, 
George Floyd gasped his last words—‘‘I can’t 
breathe’’—and ignited a nationwide reckoning 
on the racial injustice and police brutality in 
America. 
Americans from every corner of the country 
took to the streets to peacefully protest vio-
lence against Black Americans: waving Black 
Lives Matter flags, chanting the names of the 
murdered, repeating George Floyd’s dying 
words. 
They turned their agony into action, but 
tragically, despite these mass protests, the in-
justice—the killing—continues. 
Last year, 1,127 people were killed by po-
lice, far more than in the year before. In the 
months following George Floyd’s murder, 645 
people were killed—and hundreds more were 
attacked 
and 
assaulted, 
including 
Jacob 
Blake: shot seven times in the back in front of 
his three children. 
As George Floyd’s brother Philonise re-
cently said, ‘‘As a Black man in the United 
States, I want to be able to go outside and 
protest, because at this time, I don’t know who 
is going to survive or not.’’ 
As Members of Congress and as Ameri-
cans, we cannot accept this epidemic of injus-
tice. We cannot stay silent, when our most 
vulnerable and historically marginalized com-
munities—people of color, those living in pov-
erty, Americans with disabilities—are being 
targeted and killed. 
That is why, today, the House will again 
pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act—and send it to the Senate and the Presi-
dent’s desk, so that it can finally become law. 
I salute Congresswoman KAREN BASS, who 
has been relentless, persistent and absolutely 
courageous in her leadership on this legisla-
tion. Thank you to the CBC and Chair JOYCE 
BEATTY, and Judiciary Chair JERRY NADLER. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
fundamentally transforms the culture of polic-
ing with strong, unprecedented reforms, in-
cluding: banning chokeholds; stopping no- 
knock warrants; ending the court-created 
qualified immunity doctrine; combating racial 
profiling; and establishing strong new stand-
ards and protections to prevent and combat 
police misconduct. 
This legislation will not erase centuries of 
systemic racism and excessive policing in 
America. 
It will not bring back George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery or the countless other 
men and women who died or were sense-
lessly injured. 
But it will take a tremendous step forward to 
stop the violence, stem the suffering and start 
to build a healthier, better relationship be-
tween law enforcement and the communities 
that they protect. 
All of us here salute and are profoundly 
grateful for our law enforcement heroes. But 
our appreciation cannot lapse into apathy or 
acceptance of actions that are fundamentally 
incompatible with the purpose of policing. 
As the National Organization of Black Law 
Enforcement Executives writes, ‘‘The passage 
of this act is paramount in achieving the fun-
damental principle of a police force that ‘pro-
tects and serves’ every citizen of their commu-
nity, with fairness, accountability and trans-
parency in their actions.’’ 
The Democratic Congress, together with the 
Biden-Harris Administration, is committed to 
not only ensuring that this legislation becomes 
law—but to taking further action to end vio-
lence and advance justice in America. 
Let us ensure that the passage of the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is the first 
of many steps in this mission. 
And let us ensure that, as George’s brother 
said, ‘‘George’s name means something’’; and 
that, as his daughter Gianna said, ‘‘Daddy 
changed the world.’’ 
With this legislation, let us take a small step 
to ‘‘changing the world’’—for George’s family, 
for all communities of color, and for all Ameri-
cans. 
With that, I urge a strong, bipartisan vote for 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I will 
just point out that the Speaker of the 
House said we should respect the po-
lice, but the Speaker of the House 
named an individual to conduct a re-
view of the breach of the Capitol on 
January 6, and that individual has in-
sulted the very police who protect us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 
1280. 
Do you know what is terrifying to 
the American people? 
Watching Democrats try to pass a 
defund the police bill; the same Demo-
crats who cheered on and supported 
riots that burned American cities, and 
the same Democrats who shared Min-
nesota Freedom Fund bail bond links 
supporting criminals and helping them 
get out of jail. 
This bill is atrocious. Shame on all of 
you. This hurts our police officers. 
April 29, 2010, my friend, Jonathan 
Edwards, was shot in the line of duty. 
If that happened today and this bill is 
passed, getting rid of qualified immu-
nity allows the criminal who shot him 
to be able to sue him simply because 
they are upset that they were arrested. 
This same bill will also allow that 
criminal who shot him to be able to 
put his name on a national hit list that 
will be made public, whether police of-
ficers are found to have done wrong or 
not. 
This is shameful. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
OMAR). Members are reminded to direct 
remarks to the Chair and not each 
other. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act is a critical 
step towards ensuring a country where 
Black people are treated as equal citi-
zens, not just in theory, but in real life. 
This bill weaves into our laws the tru-
ism that Black Lives Matter. This bill 
will help build trust between law en-
forcement and the communities that 
they are sworn to protect and serve. 
‘‘Equal Justice Under the Law’’ may 
be etched atop the entrance to this Na-
tion’s highest court, but it is not a 
privilege enjoyed by each of us. We 
must act now to ensure that we protect 
the humanity of every person. Stand 
up for the principle of equal justice for 
all. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ for the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, the 
death of George Floyd last year led to 
communities across the Nation to 
come together to speak out against in-
justices, call for additional account-
ability and transparency in policing, 
and advocate for solutions that could 
move us forward together as a nation. 
But instead of working with Repub-
licans to find a bipartisan solution, the 
Democrat majority has, once again, 
written a partisan bill to ram through 
the House with no committee markup,

no open amendments, and no meaning-
ful bipartisan collaboration. That is 
not what the American people sent us 
here to do. 
This legislation will impede the abil-
ity of good police officers to do their 
jobs effectively and uphold the rule of 
law. Our dedicated police officers who 
serve our communities work tirelessly 
to ensure that lawlessness does not 
prevail in our streets and neighbor-
hoods. 
The effect of this bill on law enforce-
ment is to levy unfunded mandates on 
local governments, force law enforce-
ment to leave the profession, and, yes, 
defund the police. 
Madam Speaker, as you said, defund 
the police is not a slogan, but a policy 
demand. 
Madam Speaker, I will vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California, KAREN BASS, for her leader-
ship; as well as the Congressional 
Black Caucus for always speaking 
truth to power. 
Madam Speaker, today we take a 
stride towards ending racism in polic-
ing. But this is just the beginning. We 
must recognize that systemic racism 
extends well beyond law enforcement. 
Systemic racism is the way govern-
ments have deliberately impoverished 
Black families, then condition nec-
essary medical care on our ability to 
pay. 
It is the way we fund our public 
schools, a property tax-based system 
that concentrates tens of billions more 
dollars in White communities than in 
Black and Brown communities. 
In America, it is the way we run our 
elections, purging Black voters, espe-
cially in Southern States, from the 
rolls and closing the polls in Black 
neighborhoods. We can’t stop until we 
have eradicated systemic racism in all 
of its forms. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the insidious and 
false pretext for this legislation endan-
gers and ends lives. The bill rests on a 
false premise and promotes a false nar-
rative that police are racists and use 
their power to advance racist ends. 
This narrative is a false and despicable 
slander. 
Police officers do not leave their 
loved ones and risk their own lives 
every shift to oppress or discriminate. 
They do it to serve. They do it without 
fanfare and for little pay, and they 
have come to anticipate abuse in place 
of the respect that they deserve. They 
do it to save lives. 
But the reckless ‘‘defund the police’’ 
rhetoric behind this legislation is forc-
ing police to retreat and to leave the 
vulnerable at the mercy of those who 
prey upon them. 
Madam Speaker, you should run from 
that rhetoric, as you are. Madam 
Speaker, you called the police ‘‘rotten 
to the root’’ and called for it to be 
‘‘dismantled.’’ 
That 
rhetoric 
is 
killing 
people. 
Please stop the political games. Stop 
slandering law enforcement, and stop 
endangering our communities. Back 
the blue. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, no 
matter how many times Republicans 
say that this bill defunds the police, it 
doesn’t change the fact that it does not 
defund the police. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, first of 
all, we shouldn’t be talking about good 
police and bad police. There should just 
be police who are doing their job to 
serve and protect the people. So let’s 
make that clear. 
There is no such thing as good police. 
There is no good nursing. When you go 
get food, you don’t go look for: This 
place has a good chef; this one has the 
bad chef; I am going to go where the 
bad chef is. 
We don’t need this good police/bad 
police. We need police if we are going 
to have police. But I will move on. 
Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise 
on behalf of the more than 788 people 
who have been killed by law enforce-
ment over the last year. We rise 30 
years to the day after the ruthless 
beating of Rodney King. We rise in 
honor of Breonna Taylor, who was bru-
tally gunned down by police in her 
home last March. We rise for George 
Floyd and all those who have been 
killed by police since his torture and 
murder. 
Those names: William Burgess, Mark 
Brewer, Dion Johnson, Tony McDade, 
Rayshard 
Brooks, 
Modesto 
Reyes, 
Ruben Smith, David McAtee, Kamal 
Flowers, Robert Harris, Joseph Denton, 
Vincent Truitt, Sincere Pierce, Jeremy 
Southern, Angelo Crooms, and Amir 
Johnson.

Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
chairman of the committee has said 
several times that Democrats are not 
for defunding the police, but I would 
just point out the individual presiding 
over this session said that defunding 
the police is not a slogan, it is a policy 
demand. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVID-
SON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the Justice in Polic-
ing Act was crafted in response to 
George Floyd’s murder. Almost no one 
believes that that was justifiable. Par-
tisans have snatched this moment of 
unity to further divide our Nation. 
How have they done that? 
Look at this debate. Speaker after 
speaker 
has 
hurled 
insults 
falsely 
claiming that no Republican supports 
reform. Now, it is true that we don’t 
support this reform, but the majority 
has refused to even consider amend-
ments or alternatives to this partisan 
bill. 
An essential component of any jus-
tice in policing bill would correct cur-
rent injustices. I only have time to 
mention one: warrantless surveillance 
of American citizens is wrong. 
Get a warrant. 
Last year, conservatives and progres-
sives united around this point, and the 
Speaker blocked debate or amendment 
to FISA reauthorization. Now the same 
tactics are being employed. Every sin-
gle Member of Congress is here to rep-
resent American citizens, and denying 
us amendments denies all Americans a 
voice. 
Don’t politicize something that can 
heal and unite us. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
bill. Insist on regular order. 
b 1930 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, 8 
minutes, 46 seconds on George Floyd’s 
neck. ‘‘I can’t breathe.’’ 
Say their names, Madam Speaker. 
Breonna Taylor, Casey Goodson, Jr., 
Andre Hill, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, 
and so many more. 
While we can never bring them back 
and we cannot undo the pain their fam-
ilies, friends, and communities have 
felt, we can do everything in our power 
if we unite and pass this bill. 
As the chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, I urge all of my col-
leagues, Democrats and Republicans, 
to join us. 
Our power, our message, is to pass 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act. 
The right should read the bill. The 
right should quote from the bill. Show 
me those words in the bill to defund 
the police. 
I will show you accountability. I will 
show you transparency. I will show you 
justice. 
The American people are calling on 
Congress to act. Yes, Black Lives Mat-
ter. 
Let’s meet the moment and turn 
agony into action. Let’s pass the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD), a 
former sheriff. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to this bill. 
This bill should be a balefire, a warn-
ing to America that there are those

across the aisle who wish to attempt to 
federalize State and local law enforce-
ment. I would like to focus specifically, 
though, on this move to eliminate 
qualified immunity. This is a betrayal 
of law enforcement. This alone is 
enough reason to vote against this bill. 
There is a myth, a lie, perpetrated by 
those who want to do away with quali-
fied immunity, that qualified immu-
nity gives officers free rein on the job. 
This is not true. This is not sovereign 
immunity; it is qualified immunity. 
The way that an officer qualifies for 
that immunity and for it to apply in an 
action that he has taken, he must fol-
low the law, he must follow his agen-
cy’s policies, and he has to act as he 
has been appropriately trained. If he 
violates any one of those three, he is 
on his own; qualified immunity does 
not apply. 
Madam Speaker, law enforcement is 
a dangerous profession that deals in 
split-second decisions. Most people in 
this room have no idea what it is like 
to determine, in a high-stress, life- 
threatening—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 9 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 7 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. BOWMAN). 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I was 
11 years old when the police beat the 
crap out of me. Eleven years old, sixth 
grade; what threat did I pose, other 
than that of a child who was horse-
playing in the street? 
My mother and I did not feel empow-
ered to take any recourse, because in 
our community, the police, unfortu-
nately, operate as an occupying force. 
I thank God that I am alive to tell 
this 
story. 
Unfortunately, 
George 
Floyd is not alive. Philando Castile is 
not alive. Tamir Rice is not alive. 
Aiyana Jones slept in her apartment 
on her couch. She was 7 years old. Po-
lice came in with a no-knock warrant 
and murdered her. 
This is about transparency and ac-
countability, and we should pass the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
in a bipartisan way. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
this bill, and that is a shame, because 
this is an area that is ripe for bipar-
tisan compromise. 
But the House continues to spend its 
time forcing through another Demo-
cratic package that had zero Repub-
lican input. We considered this very 
same bill last Congress, but it only 
passed the House with three Repub-
lican votes in support. 
Meanwhile, 
my 
colleagues, 
Rep-
resentative PETE STAUBER and Senator 
TIM SCOTT, have proposed the JUSTICE 
Act to positively reform police to serve 
all Americans equally. 
However, their sincere efforts have 
not even been considered by those 
across the aisle. That bill would im-
prove law enforcement transparency, 
require more detailed records on the 
use of force, provide funds for body 
cameras, ban choke holds, and improve 
training to intervene in situations and 
deescalate. These are all things we 
agree upon. 
Yet, instead of equipping our law en-
forcement for success, we are consid-
ering this bill that would make it hard-
er for our police officers to keep our 
communities safe. 
Every community is different and 
dictating policy from Washington will 
only constrain our law enforcement he-
roes who put their lives on the line. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. 
My dear friends, you say you have a 
bill. Where was your bill when you had 
the House, the Senate, and the Presi-
dency, and you could have passed it? 
You say you have a bill. The same 
bill that you had to replace the Afford-
able Care Act that you never passed? 
The same bill that you had to rebuild 
the infrastructure across the length 
and breadth of this country that you 
never passed? 
Where is the invisible bill? 
I rise to support this bill that will 
deal with elimination of deadly force 
racism that can take the lives of Black 
people with impunity. 
I rise against your invisible bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded again to direct their 
remarks to the Chair and not to each 
other. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, Sen-
ator SCOTT had legislation, good legis-
lation, but the Democrats wouldn’t 
take it up; they filibustered. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOH-
MERT). 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what happened to George Floyd is atro-
cious, it is criminal, and the policeman 
will be held accountable; he has got to 
be. 
But that has nothing to do with 
eliminating immunity for countless po-
licemen across the country. This bill 
does not properly address or prevent 
what happened in poor George Floyd’s 
case. 
Why would we have a bill that elimi-
nates immunity for anybody charging 
the Capitol, breaking in illegally? They 
would be able to sue the police in the 
future, tie them up in court. Why 
would we do that? Because if we do 
this—follow 
the 
money—then 
the 
unions will be selling a lot of liability 
insurance; it will be the biggest fund-
raiser they have ever had. 
Let’s get together and come together 
on a bill that will not just raise money, 
not just hire more lawyers, but will 
solve the problem of the death, as 
criminal as it was, of George Floyd. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, 
this bill isn’t about what we just heard. 
This bill is a moment of potential re-
demption for a country riven by racial 
division, riven by a history of racism 
going back to slavery, the Reconstruc-
tion 
era, 
post-Reconstruction, 
Jim 
Crow, the violent oppression of people 
because of the color of their skin. 
We, in this body, have an opportunity 
to redeem our country and its history. 
Let us unite behind that cause and that 
opportunity at redemption. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1280, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
of 2021. 
The peaceful protests for racial justice last 
summer compelled a long overdue reckoning 
for our country to take action to fulfill Amer-
ica’s promise of equality no matter the color of 
your skin. 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor this 
proposal to end police brutality and address 
the systemic racism that has marred American 
law enforcement for generations. 
With this legislation, we finally say enough 
is enough: We’ve had enough of racial and re-
ligious profiling; Enough of no-knock warrants 
and chokeholds; and Enough of police using 
military-grade equipment on our American 
streets. 
We are a country crying out for an end to 
the centuries-long scourge of racist brutality 
that has stolen so many black lives from our 
communities. 
The Justice in Policing Act will help erode 
the culture of impunity within too many of our 
police forces by bringing much-needed ac-
countability and transparency to our law en-
forcement institutions. 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1280, a 
purely partisan bill, developed with 
zero Republican input, that would 
defund the police and hamstring the 
ability of our law enforcement agencies 
to keep our communities safe. 
This bill would lower the legal 
threshold to criminally prosecute a po-
lice officer for deprivation of rights, 
which would, at best, lead to a torrent 
of frivolous cases against officers and, 
at worst, discourage them from doing 
their jobs. 
Our officers are already forced to 
work in difficult environments. Count-
less officers have already simply quit 
or retired early, while morale has 
plummeted for those who stay. It will 
continue if this bill passes. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1280, a bill that 
defunds the police. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1068 
March 3, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 61⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, Eric Garner, 
George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, all 
Black men and women who were killed 
by police. 
It is in their memory that I rise 
today in support of the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, because we 
cannot live up to our ideals of justice 
for all while BIPOC Americans are dis-
proportionately killed by police. 
We need to pass this bill to save 
lives, to reform qualified immunity, to 
ban no-knock warrants like the one 
that 
contributed 
to 
the 
death 
of 
Breonna Taylor, to end the use of 
choke holds that killed Eric Garner 
and George Floyd. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
voting to pass this long overdue bill, to 
join me in this work to make this 
country a safer, more just place for all 
Americans. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. 
DOGGETT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
death and destruction at this Capitol 
from recent Trump-instigated violence 
shows the result of insufficient polic-
ing. The deaths of George Floyd and 
Breonna Taylor, and in my area, Mike 
Ramos and Javier Ambler, and too 
many more, from misconduct, show the 
result of insufficient justice. As the 
name of this bill, ‘‘Justice in Polic-
ing,’’ indicates this bill is not about re-
moving the police; it is about removing 
the injustice. It seeks accountability. 
It seeks equal justice under the law 
by our law enforcers, particularly for 
people of color, who have too often 
been victimized by systemic racism. 
Instead of working with us to make it 
better and secure our communities and 
more justice for all, many of today’s 
Republican opponents are only spout-
ing the poisonous slogans of Trumpism. 
Because Black and Brown lives do mat-
ter, let’s approve this bill to achieve 
greater justice for all in an America 
that is safer for all. 
b 1945 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to this 
bill, which represents the worst of 
Washington: defunding police in a sur-
prise vote in the middle of the night. 
This bill advances the far-left Demo-
crat platform, and would defund the 
police through unfunded mandates that 
cost State and local departments mil-
lions of dollars. 
If this weren’t bad enough, the bill 
advances an antipolice agenda with 
Washington-knows-best 
regulations, 
and puts a target on the backs of ev-
eryday officers by creating a national 
database of complaints that have not 
been adjudicated. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the bill. I 
stand with law enforcement, and I am 
grateful for those who serve on the 
thin blue line. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, as a person of color who has 
seen in my own life the dehumanizing 
effect of stop-and-frisk policing in New 
York City, I know firsthand that the 
Achilles’ heel of American policing is 
the absence of accountability. 
We, as a country, have a choice. We 
can either choose police accountability 
or choose qualified immunity, but we 
cannot choose both. 
The purpose of the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act is not to second- 
guess officers who act in good faith. 
The objective is to hold liable officers 
who repeatedly abuse their power and 
who rarely, if ever, face consequences 
for their repeat abuses. 
If you are a good officer, you have 
nothing to fear. But if you are a bad of-
ficer, you have accountability to fear, 
and fear accountability, you should. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS). 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, what we saw happen to 
George Floyd was not an isolated inci-
dent. It was a modern-day lynching 
caught on camera, and it must stop. 
Black men, women, and children are 
done dying. We are done dying at the 
hands of police. 
Law enforcement should protect and 
serve. But in communities of color, we 
don’t have the luxury of making that 
assumption. Many Black people get the 
talk, instructions on how to act when 
encountering police to increase the 
likelihood of returning home alive. 
These are survival tactics that my hus-
band and I don’t want to have to pass 
on to my young Black son, but we 
must. 
For Black and Brown people every-
where, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act. Let’s affirm our commit-
ment to root out police brutality and 
ensure accountability in policing. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in loving memory of Aiyana 
Jones, who was only 7 years old when 
she was killed by Detroit police. 
The fact that the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act could have been 
named after countless other people 
murdered by police shows that this is 
long overdue. It is important to note 
this bill is a start, not the end, of our 
movement to transform what it means 
to feel safe in our country. 
We must demand true accountability, 
justice, and reparations for the genera-
tions of police brutality against our 
Black communities. We must invest in 
the social programs that we know will 
give our communities the opportunity 
to thrive. 
This is the justice that Aiyana Jones 
and George Floyd and many other lives 
lost to police violence deserve. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 21⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 31⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, there 
is an old African proverb that says: 
Until the lions tell their own story, the 
tales of the hunt will always glorify 
the hunter. 
Who are the lions? They are the vic-
tims. They are Black and Brown and 
indigenous. They have suffered, en-
dured, and survived 200 years of bru-
tality, slavery, racism, Jim Crow, op-
pression, deprivation, degradation, de-
nial, and disprivilege. 
We have learned in this country one 
thing, that justice comes in small 
steps. And when we consider the en-
slavement of the Negro, the extermi-
nation of the Indian, the annexation of 
the Hispanic, our Nation that we love 
had an iniquitous conception. 
So these small steps, no matter how 
painful they are, must be taken. This 
bill helps move us toward a more per-
fect Union. I urge passage of the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
as a representative of more than a 
quarter of NYPD’s 36,000 active offi-
cers, and thousands more retirees and 
first responders, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1280 and every piece of leg-
islation that aims to cripple or degrade 
our law enforcement. 
Instead of working with Republicans, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle have chosen to push forth yet an-
other partisan bill that will diminish 
public safety and prevent our law en-
forcement officers from serving and 
protecting our communities, all while 
trying to hold them personally liable. 
The brave men and women who put on 
the uniform every day deserve better. 
We have offered real solutions to in-
crease 
transparency, 
accountability, 
and performance so our Nation’s law 
enforcement officers can better serve 
and protect all. 
But make no mistake, this bill you 
are about to pass today defunds the po-
lice. The Congressional Budget Office

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1069 
March 3, 2021 
has confirmed that the unfunded man-
dates contained in this bill will drain 
the resources of State and local law en-
forcement to the tune of several hun-
dred million dollars. This is negligence. 
As a resident of New York City who 
has seen our police department’s budg-
et slashed by a billion dollars by politi-
cians who think they know more than 
the officers doing the job on the street, 
I can tell you that there are serious 
ramifications. 
Crime has skyrocketed. Last year, 
shootings increased by 97 percent, and 
murders increased by 44 percent. We 
have seen livelihoods and properties 
destroyed by rioters and looters in cit-
ies across America. 
Government’s number one responsi-
bility to its citizenry is to keep them 
safe. Defunding law enforcement is an 
abdication of that responsibility. 
Tonight, I call on every Member of 
this body to cosponsor my Right to Re-
main Safe Act, which holds local gov-
ernments responsible should someone 
become a victim of a crime due to gov-
ernment’s negligence. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit today, we will in-
struct the Judiciary Committee to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 1280 to in-
clude a simple, straightforward sense 
of Congress strongly rejecting efforts 
to defund the police. 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues say 
they don’t support defunding the po-
lice. Well, here is their chance to show 
it. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to say thank you to the 
millions of Americans who peacefully 
put this bill on the agenda. 
It was nowhere last year until we saw 
8 minutes and 46 seconds of a man 
being murdered, a Black man, George 
Floyd. People—White, Black, all dif-
ferent colors—took to the streets, and 
they said, ‘‘No more.’’ I want to thank 
those activists and ordinary people 
who said we don’t have to tolerate this. 
The bill passed last year, and it is 
going to pass again because the Amer-
ican people are tired of this racism and 
the killing and killing and killing of 
Black people. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, you said: Defunding 
the police is not a slogan; it is a policy 
demand. 
Over 20 cities in this great country 
enacted that. They did that to the tune 
of $1.7 billion taken from the brave 
men and women who protect us all. 
That is our concern. 
We would have loved to have worked 
with the other side. We had a bill. Sen-
ator SCOTT
worked tirelessly on it. 
Representative STAUBER, former police 
officer STAUBER, on our side worked 
night and day on it. But Democrats 
wouldn’t work with us, wouldn’t take 
any of our amendments. 
This is a partisan, political bill, un-
fortunately. That is why I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS). 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the George Floyd Justice 
in Policing Act, which bans police 
choke holds, creates a national police 
misconduct registry, and eliminates 
qualified immunity, among other need-
ed provisions. 
I grieved when first watching George 
Floyd’s murder by a cop, and I grieve 
still over the continued loss of so many 
Blacks killed by cops. There have been 
149 Black men killed at the hands of 
police since George Floyd’s murder. I 
have been fighting against this police 
brutality since my first days as a mem-
ber of the California State Assembly. 
But here we are, mourning the vic-
tims of police choke holds, Blacks 
being shot in the back, fathers being 
killed in front of their children and 
their families. We Blacks are under 
siege by rogue cops, who we pay to pro-
tect and serve us, and White suprema-
cists and domestic terrorists. 
We have to resist this. We have to 
say to bad cops in blue that we are 
going to fight you. Or proud boys in 
yellow gear, we are going to fight you. 
We are going to resist you. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, a comprehensive bill to address 
systemic racism in law enforcement. 
Today’s legislation is named for George 
Floyd, whose senseless death at the hands of 
a police officer shocked the conscience of mil-
lions of Americans and sparked a long-over-
due reckoning on race in America and a 
movement demanding racial justice. Congress 
has heard this call for justice, and in response, 
Congresswoman KAREN BASS and the Con-
gressional Black Caucus have written this crit-
ical legislation to hold police accountable, 
change the culture of law enforcement, and 
build trust between law enforcement and the 
communities they serve. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
takes these challenges head on by banning 
chokeholds, mandating racial bias training, 
ending qualified immunity, restricting the sale 
of military-grade weapons to local police de-
partments, and establishing a National Police 
Misconduct Registry. While the inequities in 
our criminal justice system are immense, this 
legislation is a bold step to address systemic 
racism in law enforcement, and the time has 
come to make these reforms the law of the 
land. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to affirm my support as an original 
cosponsor for H.R. 1280, the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act of 2021. 
This is not a new issue. But one that we 
continue to revisit over. And over. And over. 
Madam Speaker, how many times will my 
Republican colleagues affirm that Black Lives 
Matter as the blood of Black Lives cry out 
from American cities and streets? 
Despite what my Republican colleagues are 
purporting, the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act will not defund the police. 
But what it will do is bring us one step clos-
er to justice by: banning chokeholds; prohib-
iting no-knock warrants; ending the qualified 
immunity doctrine that is a barrier to holding 
police officers accountable for wrongful con-
duct; Combatting racial profiling; Mandating 
there be data collection of these incidences for 
tracking, including body cameras and dash-
board cameras; and; establishing new stand-
ards for policing. 
George Floyd’s death should not be in vain. 
And as a mother of a black son. Grandmother 
to three black grandsons, I do not want to 
have to worry about their safety when they en-
counter the police who are sworn to protect 
and serve. Not be the judge, jury, and onsite 
executioner. 
Black lives matter, Madam Speaker, and it 
is past time that the laws of our nation reflect 
it. That is why I am urging my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this bill. It 
goes without saying that I strongly encourage 
its immediate consideration and passage in 
the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 179, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Malliotakis moves to recommit the 
bill H.R. 1280 to the Committee on the Judi-
ciary. 
The material previously referred to 
by Ms. MALLIOTAKIS is as follows: 
Add, at the end of the bill, the following 
(and conform the table of contents): 
SEC. 503. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES. 
It is the sense of the House of Representa-
tives that the House— 
(1) recognizes and appreciates the dedica-
tion and devotion demonstrated by the men 
and women of law enforcement who keep our 
communities and our nation safe; and 
(2) condemns calls to ‘‘defund’’, ‘‘disband’’, 
‘‘dismantle’’, or ‘‘abolish’’ the police. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 2(b) of rule XIX, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the motion 
to recommit. 
The question is on the motion to re-
commit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.

Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that in the engross-
ment of H.R. 1, the Clerk be authorized 
to correct section numbers, punctua-
tion, spelling, and cross-references and 
to make such other technical and con-
forming changes as may be necessary 
to reflect the actions of the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1073 
March 3, 2021 
CONTRACT FOR USPS FLEET 
VEHICLES 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with great concern regarding the re-
cently announced contract between the 
United States Post Office and Oshkosh 
Defense for the construction of 165,000 
postal vehicles over the next decade, 
all new. 
There is no doubt our postal fleet is 
aging. The Grumman LLV, in service 
since 1994, is gas powered and lacks 
basic safety equipment like airbags or 
air conditioning. 
Unfortunately, this contract lacks 
any commitment to make these vehi-
cles new age, either electric, hybrid, or 
advanced biofuels. 
While new vehicles are said to be ca-
pable 
of 
incorporating 
an 
electric 
drivetrain, Postmaster General Louis 
DeJoy, who has been a disaster for the 
Postal Service, recently indicated only 
10 percent of the new fleet will be elec-
tric. Ten percent? That makes no sense 
and flies in the face of the Biden ad-
ministration’s recent order to electrify 
the Federal fleet. 
DeJoy’s failed tenure calls into ques-
tion the awarding of this contract. 
As such, the administration and the 
Postal Service must delay the contract 
until a review is conducted to deter-
mine that there was not inappropriate 
political influence in the process and 
that the proposed contract is con-
sistent with Biden’s Executive Order 
on tackling the climate crisis. 
This contract is a multi-billion-dol-
lar opportunity to reimagine the Fed-
eral fleet and develop this critical do-
mestic supply chain. We can’t fumble 
this opportunity.

HONORING CENTENNIAL OF THE 
TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER 
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of the centennial of the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier. 
The following is the resolution this 
body passed 100 years ago tomorrow, 
H.J. Res. 426. 
‘‘Providing for the bringing to the 
United States of the body of an un-
known American, who was a member of 
the American Expeditionary Forces, 
who served in Europe and lost his life 
during the World War, and for the bur-
ial of the remains with appropriate 
ceremonies. 
‘‘Resolved by the Senate and House 
of Representatives of the United States 
of America in Congress assembled, 
That the Secretary of War be, and he is 
hereby, authorized and directed, under 
regulations to be prescribed by him, to 
cause to be brought to the United 
States the body of an American, who 
was a member of the American Expedi-
tionary Forces who served in Europe, 
who lost his life during the World War 
and whose identity has not been estab-
lished, for burial in the Memorial Am-
phitheater of the National Cemetery at 
Arlington, Virginia. 
‘‘Such sum as may be necessary to 
carry out the provisions of the joint 
resolution is hereby authorized to be 
expended by the Secretary of War.’’ 
Madam Speaker, they will not be for-
gotten. 
f 
DELIVERING RELIEF TO COMMU-
NITIES AND ESSENTIAL WORK-
ERS 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored to have been able to vote 
‘‘yes’’ last week for the American Res-
cue Plan Act and join my House col-
leagues in sending this critically im-
portant legislation to the Senate. 
It is past time that we enact bold re-
lief that delivers critical resources to 
individuals, families, and communities 
throughout our Nation so that we can 
get back to work and past this health 
crisis. 
I am pleased that this legislation in-
cludes vital health care provisions to 
support community vaccination sites, 
scale up testing and tracing, and ad-
dress care disparities. 
Further, this legislation includes sig-
nificant resources to assist schools in 
reopening. We must continue to do all 
we can to support our intrepid teachers 
and the critical work that they are 
doing in this challenging time to en-
gage students and prepare them with 
the life skills they need for their career 
endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, the momentum is 
on our side to defeat this virus. I en-
courage my Senate colleagues to take 
the next step in approving this legisla-
tion as soon as possible so that we can 
provide all of our communities and our 
valiant essential workers with the re-
sources they need. 
f 
CELEBRATING HOT SPRINGS 
NATIONAL PARK CENTENNIAL 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the 100th anni-
versary of Hot Springs National Park. 
Nearly 5,500 acres of forested hills 
settle just above historic downtown 
Hot Springs, Arkansas, protecting 47 
thermal water springs. Hot Springs Na-
tional Park attracts millions of tour-
ists each year with its rich multigener-
ational legacy of preserving history 
and conserving natural resources for 
public health, wellness, and enjoyment. 
First named Hot Springs Reservation 
in 1832, the land was one of the first 
federally protected parcels of land in 
the country. Its official National Park 
designation on March 4, 1921, led to the 
park quickly becoming a source of na-
tional intrigue. Bathhouse Row drew 
millions of people seeking health rem-
edies in the thermal spring waters. 
Many of these bathhouses still stand 
today, offering visitors a glimpse into 
local history, art, and culture. 
I take this time to honor the Na-
tional Park Service’s century of care-
taking of one of Arkansas’ most valu-
able natural treasures. I look forward 
to the next 100 years, and I invite the 
world to come to experience my home, 
beautiful Hot Springs National Park, 
Arkansas. 
f 
FIXING AN ALREADY SECURE 
ELECTION 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
my Democrat colleagues say that the 
2020 election was the least corrupt and 
most secure in our Nation’s history. 
But if that is true, Madam Speaker, 
then why are they pushing an 800-page 
bill to fix it? 
f 
ONE DOSE OF THE PFIZER 
VACCINE 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to Operation 
Warp Speed, we now have a pathway 
out of the pandemic using anti-COVID 
vaccines, but I want to share some 
more good news. 
A new study published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine shows 
that just one dose of the Pfizer vaccine 
has an efficacy of close to 93 percent. 
The clinical difference between 92 per-
cent and 95 percent of the two-dose reg-
imen is minuscule. 
If we gave everyone, except possibly 
the most vulnerable, just the first dose, 
we could possibly double our supply 
immediately and thus inoculate our 
citizens much faster. Using this strat-
egy, we could possibly prevent the 
spread of new variants and mutants 
and effect a quicker end to this tragic 
pandemic, which has already cost hun-
dreds of thousands of lives in this coun-
try. 
Yesterday, I joined some of my fellow 
physician 
colleagues, 
asking 
the 
Health and Human Services Depart-
ment to consider adopting this strat-
egy. 
Acting now could prevent the spread 
of new variants and the further spread 
of this tragedy, the kind of tragedy al-
ready felt and continuing to be felt by 
thousands across this country. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the 
Health Secretary to follow the science.

RECOGNIZING VENANGO MUSEUM 
OF ART, SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the Venango Museum of Art, 
Science and Industry in Oil City, Penn-
sylvania. 
The museum plays a big role in main-
taining the culture and history of the 
region with educational programming 
and rotating exhibits. 
Recently, the executive director of 
the museum, Betsy Kellner, reached 
out to my office to let us know of an 
exciting project the museum was able 
to complete thanks to funding provided 
by the Pennsylvania Humanities Coun-
cil and the National Endowment for 
the Humanities through the CARES 
Act. 
The museum is the proud owner of a 
1928 Wurlitzer pipe organ, which was 
previously held in the historic Latonia 
Theater in Oil City. The museum was 
able to refurbish the organ, a feat that 
took thousands of volunteer hours and 
more than 600 different pipes. 
After the organ was successfully re-
furbished, the Venango Museum of Art, 
Science and Industry hosted a virtual 
concert for residents to enjoy. The con-
cert can also be viewed online at 
venangomuseum.org. 
I would like to thank Betsy and the 
museum team for providing this en-
riching cultural experience for the resi-
dents of Venango County during the 
pandemic. 
f 
RESPECT DR. SEUSS BY 
FORGETTING CANCEL CULTURE 
(Mr. MOONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOONEY. Madam Speaker, let’s 
not attempt to steal knowledge of our 
Nation’s history from our children, 
like the Grinch attempted to steal 
Christmas. 
I rise to honor the legendary Dr. 
Seuss for Read Across America Day. 
Yesterday would also have been his 
117th birthday. 
Before he became a world-famous 
writer, Seuss attended Dartmouth Col-
lege, my alma mater. He was also a 
member of the New Hampshire Alpha 
Chapter of the fraternity Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, of which I was also a member. 
We used to love showing Theodore 
Geisel’s class photo on the wall to visi-
tors. 
But in the spirit of cancel culture, 
publishers have discontinued six of his 
books. Dr. Seuss was known as a pro-
gressive for his time. His famous story 
‘‘The Lorax’’ was about protecting the 
environment. 
My favorite, ‘‘Marvin K. Mooney Will 
You Please Go Now!’’ my 6-year-old 
daughter thinks was written just for 
her. Children grow up dreaming about 
‘‘Oh, the Places You’ll Go!’’ a Dr. Seuss 
book with the lessons we find through-
out our life’s journey. 
Madam Speaker, we should all re-
spect and honor Dr. Seuss and forget 
this cancel culture nonsense.

TRANSFORMING SCHEDULE 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there needs to be comment about the 
way the schedule was totally trans-
formed, once again. 
What drove this change? 
We were supposed to be debating the 
George Floyd bill tomorrow. George 
Floyd deserves a better bill than he 
got, a bipartisan bill that we would 
certainly be willing to work with the 
Democrats on, but they didn’t want our 
help. We rushed through and did it to-
night. 
We asked: What was the reason for 
the dramatic change? Is somebody 
ashamed of what we are bringing and 
they want to do it late at night? 
We were told: No. There is concern 
from somebody that the QAnon-an-
nounced inauguration will be tomor-
row, so we need to get out of town. 
Apparently, there is somebody that 
believes it. I don’t know anybody on 
our side, but perhaps the Speaker and 
the majority leader are the believers in 
QAnon. Nobody else here that I know 
of.

SENATE SERGEANT AT ARMS 
STAFF 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
begin this morning with a very excit-
ing announcement about critical lead-
ership roles in the Senate Chamber. 
Three outstanding individuals are set 
to resume new responsibilities. LTG 
Karen Gibson will serve as the next 
Senate Sergeant at Arms, while Kelly 
Fado will serve as Deputy Sergeant at 
Arms, and Jennifer Hemingway will 
serve as Chief of Staff. 
The Senate Sergeant at Arms was es-
tablished 223 years ago as an outgrowth 
of the Office of the Senate Doorkeeper, 
back when one of the biggest problems 
was making sure the Senate had a 
quorum. Today, the Sergeant at Arms 
is the Senate’s chief administrative of-
ficer and chief law enforcement officer, 
so very important at this time. These 
offices have the enormous responsi-
bility of keeping the trains running on 
time, while at the same time keeping 
everyone in the Capitol safe. As we 
have seen in recent weeks, the security 
component of the role is immensely 
important. 
LTG Karen Gibson is the perfect per-
son for this job, the job of Sergeant at 
Arms. She has spent 33 years in Active 
Duty in the military, much of it in the 
Office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence as a senior intelligence officer, 
where she supported U.S. national se-
curity objectives in Iraq, Afghanistan, 
East Africa, Korea, the Pacific, and 
across the Middle East. 
She is ready to hit the ground run-
ning because since January 6, she has 
been part of a weekslong review to 
identify actions that can be taken im-
mediately—immediately—to 
improve 
the security of the Capitol and its 
Members. She is 100 percent committed 
to ensuring a safe and secure working 
environment for Senators, visitors, 
Capitol employees, Senate staff, press, 
and paying particular attention to 
staffers of color. 
Lieutenant General Gibson has a big 
job ahead of her, but I have every con-
fidence she will perform her duties at 
the same exemplary standard she set 
over the course of her heralded three- 
decade military career. 
Kelly Fado and Jennifer Hemingway, 
meanwhile, are two of the most rec-
ognizable faces in the Capitol, Jennifer 
having recently filled in as the Acting 
Sergeant at Arms. Kelly has been part

of my team for many years, on the 
Rules Committee and in my leadership 
office. She has helped plan, coordinate, 
safeguard, and execute multiple Presi-
dential 
inaugurations—and 
what 
a 
great job she has done in every one of 
them—and Capitol-wide ceremonies in 
general. She has been an indispensable 
resource to me and to my entire staff. 
I am very glad that Kelly is taking on 
this challenge. 
One other note that I am very proud 
of—I think we all as Senators can be 
proud of—this will be the first time in 
the Senate’s history that the Sergeant 
at Arms’ leadership will be comprised 
entirely of women. I cannot think of a 
team better prepared than LTG Karen 
Gibson, Kelly Fado, and Jennifer Hem-
ingway. 
To all three of them: Congratulations 
on your new roles, and thank you for 
your many years of service to the Sen-
ate and to our country. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on the American Rescue Plan, as early 
as tonight, the Senate will move to 
take up the American Rescue Plan, a 
bill designed to immediately deliver 
help to American families, workers, 
and businesses struggling under the 
weight of the pandemic and to lay the 
foundation for our Nation’s recovery, 
so needed. 
Every day, we see signs of hope and 
signs of caution in our fight against 
the COVID pandemic. As of today, in 
good part because the Biden adminis-
tration is really doing a good job, over 
78 million doses of the COVID vaccine 
have been administered in the country 
and 
over 
100 
million 
have 
been 
shipped—well ahead of the rosiest ex-
pectations at the start of the year. 
Just yesterday, President Biden an-
nounced that there will be enough vac-
cines for every adult in the United 
States by the end of May—by the end 
of May—far sooner than most had 
thought. Again, President Biden and 
his team are doing a great job in mov-
ing the vaccine out quickly but fairly. 
Still, the United States averages 
66,000 cases of COVID per week. That 
exceeds anything we saw last summer 
during the worst months of the spread. 
So we cannot relax, and the need for 
the legislation that is before us is 
stronger than ever before. 
It is a similar story with the econ-
omy. There are green shoots, but un-
employment is still over 6 percent and 
9 percent for African Americans. The 
economy has lost 10 million jobs com-
pared to a year ago. Tens of millions of 
Americans report being thousands of 
dollars behind in rent and utilities. As 
Treasury Secretary Yellen and Federal 
Reserve Chair Powell have repeatedly 
warned us, our economy and its recov-
ery remain deeply uncertain. 
There are bumps but mainly because 
of the stimulus bills we have done. We 
did a bill in March, and the May and 
June numbers looked pretty good but 
then sunk again over the summer and 
fall. We did a bill in December, and the 
January numbers looked pretty good. 
But that is not evidence that the econ-
omy is able to sustain things on its 
own; that is evidence that the Federal 
Government needs to continue its role 
to get us back on track. 
We have come a long way, but we 
have a long way to go. The American 
Rescue Plan is designed to build on our 
early progress and finish the job, to 
help our country get through the final 
months of the crisis and then, equally 
important, bring our economy roaring 
back. 
We cannot go through the situation 
we did back in 2009, where the stimulus 
wasn’t strong enough and we stayed in 
recession for years. So just because the 
numbers are not as bad as they were 
doesn’t mean we don’t need a contin-
ued strong push to get us out of this 
ditch and go upward and forward. 
Now, we had always hoped that this 
very important work would be bipar-
tisan. Regrettably, it seems that too 
many of our Republican colleagues are 
resorting to the same predictable ob-
jections they raise about nearly every 
proposal supported by a Democrat. It 
doesn’t matter what is in the bill; ev-
erything my colleagues oppose is ‘‘a 
liberal wish list’’. That is what many 
of them call it. 
Let me tell you, this bill is not a lib-
eral wish list; this is an American wish 
list. When people want checks to help 
them get out of the morass, that is not 
a liberal wish list; that is what the 
American people want. It is an Amer-
ican wish list. When people want re-
sources to open schools quickly and 
safely, that is not a liberal wish list; 
that is an American wish list. When 
people want assistance for the hardest- 
hit small businesses, that is not a lib-
eral wish list; that is an American wish 
list. Funding to keep teachers, fire-
fighters, transit workers, first respond-
ers in Red States and Blue on the job, 
it is not a liberal wish list; it is an 
American wish list. 
So many of the people affected by 
this bill are not liberals or Democrats. 
They may be Republicans, they may be 
Independents, they may be conserv-
atives, but they are Americans who 
want some help to get out of this mo-
rass. 
Money to expand the testing and 
speed of the distribution of vaccines, 
the cornerstone of ending this crisis 
once and for all—that is not a liberal 
wish list; that is an American wish list. 
Everyone wants the vaccine out there. 
Direct checks, as I mentioned, as prom-
ised to Americans struggling to keep 
up with expenses, to buy their gro-
ceries, medicine, to pay the rent and 
utilities—that is not a liberal wish list; 
that is an American wish list. 
I would ask my Republican col-
leagues to go ask their constituents 
which of these things their constitu-
ents oppose. None. That is what the 
data shows. 
The American Rescue Plan will be 
the single largest anti-poverty bill in 
recent history, with crucial assistance 
for American families, particularly 
those struggling with the cost of 
childcare. It will give tax breaks for 
low-income workers, so when they 
work hard, they can afford the neces-
sities of life. 
So these things are ‘‘the liberal wish 
list’’ that Republicans are talking 
about—support for schools and jobs and 
families and workers and the vaccine? 
No way. 
Ironically, the ‘‘liberal wish list’’ in-
cludes a whole bunch of bipartisan 
amendments that were accepted, in-
cluding provisions to help restaurants, 
sponsored by Senators SINEMA
and 
WICKER; a vaccine public awareness 
program, 
sponsored 
by 
Senators 
CARDIN and PORTMAN; and a provision 
to better target direct payments, spon-
sored by Senators MANCHIN and COL-
LINS. 
Make no mistake, the American Res-
cue Plan is a very, very strong bill that 
will move our country forward in 
amazing ways. It should come as no 
surprise that support of the American 
Rescue Plan is coming from all over 
the country. 
Hundreds of business leaders—not the 
most liberal bunch—have urged Con-
gress to pass this bill. More than 435 
mayors and State leaders, Democrats 
and Republicans, have said the same: 
They want the bill. As one Republican 
mayor from Michigan put it, ‘‘The need 
is real, and not just in Democratic 
communities.’’ He went on to tell his 
fellow Republicans in Washington who 
oppose the bill to ‘‘talk to some of the 
Republican mayors.’’ 
But if my Republican colleagues here 
in the Senate don’t want to listen to 
the words of their fellow Republican 
mayors and Governors, they can look 
at the polls, which show the vast ma-
jority of Americans, including a major-
ity of Republicans, support this bill. 
It seems like the only people who are 
dead set against this bill are Repub-
lican Senators—not Republicans out in 
the country, not Republican mayors, 
not Republican businesspeople, not Re-
publican small businesses. 
I guess all of this should be expected. 
COVID–19 is not a Red State or a Blue 
State crisis. Our Republican friends 
should know that. It is not a Demo-
cratic or Republican concern. They 
should know that too. COVID–19 is a 
menace to all of us, and we should be 
banding together to fight. 
The economic crisis has affected all 
of us, and the plan that we are going to 
vote on this week is going to provide 
real, robust relief for all of us. 
Whatever our Republican colleagues 
decide to do, the Senate majority is in-
tent on going forward and helping the 
American people with bold action 
quickly. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

March 3, 2021 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will be in a period of morning 
business, with Senators permitted to 
speak therein for up to 10 minutes 
each. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
year, 
Congress 
rallied 
five 
times 
around historic bipartisan legislation 
to meet urgent and unprecedented 
needs. Our COVID–19 packages rein-
forced the healthcare frontlines, fueled 
the sprint for vaccines, and cast life-
lines for the workers and small busi-
nesses hit hardest by shutdowns. 
Together, those bills cost about $4 
trillion, but none of those measures 
passed the House of Representatives 
with less than a bipartisan super-
majority of about 80 percent—com-
pletely overwhelming support. 
Then, last week, House Democrats 
rammed through the American Rescue 
Plan Act on a razor-thin margin of 50.7 
percent. The only thing bipartisan 
about their bill was the opposition to 
it. Their bill costs about $2 trillion. 
That is roughly the same size as the 
entire CARES Act that saved our 
health system and economy through 
months of shutdowns last year. Even 
liberal experts admit this is far out of 
proportion to what is needed now, with 
vaccines going into arms and the econ-
omy already primed to literally roar 
back. 
Amazingly, Democrats managed to 
allocate less than 9 percent—9 per-
cent—of their massive bill to the entire 
healthcare response; 9 percent of the 
$1.9 trillion related to the healthcare 
response, and—listen to this—even less 
than 1 percent of the $1.9 trillion to the 
vaccines that will actually finish the 
fight. 
They needed to save the other 91 per-
cent of the borrowed money for a vast 
catalog of liberal spending with basi-
cally no relationship whatsoever to 
beating COVID–19. For example, they 
want to send wheelbarrows of cash to 
State and local bureaucrats to bail out 
mismanagement from before the pan-
demic. They are changing the previous 
bipartisan funding formula in ways 
that will especially bias the money to-
ward big blue States. This outraged a 
bipartisan group of Governors, largely 
from middle America, who went on 
record this week. There are generous 
new benefit packages for government 
employees. There are provisions to let 
abortion providers drain money from 
rescue programs that were built to 
save Main Street small businesses. 
There is a strange new Acela corridor 
kickback where they will make Medi-
care send more money to just New Jer-
sey, Rhode Island, and Delaware. 
Just looking at the timeframe for all 
of their spending belies any notion that 
this is an urgent rescue plan. 
Take the K–12 funding which, con-
trary to science, Democrats say is a 
prerequisite for opening schools. Nine-
ty-five percent of that supposedly ur-
gent money would not be spent this fis-
cal year but, instead, over the next 7 
years. Let me say that again. Ninety- 
five percent of the money for K–12 is 
not going to be spent this year, but 
over the next 7 years. That is not my 
definition of an emergency. 
Grants for rural healthcare would be 
on a slow drip out through fiscal 2024. 
Agriculture-related funds would trickle 
out over the next—listen to this—over 
the next decade. It doesn’t sound very 
urgent to me. 
What the American people need are 
fast-acting plans to get schools re-
opened now, get laid-off workers back 
into jobs, and finish the fight against 
this virus right now. The Democrats 
have, instead, drawn up a liberal omni-
bus to fund miscellaneous government 
spending over the next decade. 
We are adding all this money to the 
national debt, and they have a rescue 
package with most of the money being 
spent out far in the future. That is why 
there was bipartisan opposition over in 
the House. That is why aspects of the 
House bill are already dropping like 
flies before this thing even hits the 
Senate floor. 
A pet project for the San Francisco 
Bay area is gone. Special upgrades for 
a bridge connecting New York to Can-
ada, gone. Even CNN had to admit 
these were ‘‘controversial.’’ Senator 
SANDERS’ far-left minimum wage pol-
icy that would have killed 1.4 million 
jobs just as we try to recover appears 
to be gone, too—at least for now. 
According to public reports, right 
now, as we speak, several of our Demo-
cratic colleagues are frantically trying 
to trim back other crazy provisions: 
the runaway government bailouts, the 
policies that will keep workers at 
home when we should be focusing on 
rehiring. 
Just a few days ago, President 
Biden’s Chief of Staff bragged that this 
smorgasbord of borrowed money will 
add up to ‘‘the most progressive domes-
tic legislation in a generation.’’ 
So that is what you get when the 
Democratic leader persuades all of my 
distinguished friends across the aisle 
that their first undertaking as Senate 
committee 
chairmen 
should 
be 
to 
outsource all their gavels to the House. 
The Senate wrote the CARES Act. In 
the earliest days of the crisis, this 
Chamber took the bull by the horns. I 
personally assembled bipartisan task 
forces that crafted urgent solutions to 
help America weather the storm. 
This time around, on the substance, 
the Senate has been largely missing in 
action. House Democrats are bristling 
and publicly pushing back if our Sen-
ate Democratic colleagues even try to 
make their mark on this partisan bill 
in small ways. 
So these two radically different proc-
esses have generated two radically dif-
ferent pieces of legislation. 
The Democrats had a choice. They 
chose to go it alone, tack to the left, 
leave families’ top priorities on the 
cutting-room floor. 
f 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
a completely different matter, just 6 
weeks into unified Democratic govern-
ment, we already have another crisis 
brewing on our southern border. In 
January, Customs and Border Protec-
tion logged more than 78,000 encoun-
ters on our southwest border, more 
than double the figure from January of 
2020. 
Last week, HHS sources told report-
ers we just logged the busiest February 
in the history of the Unaccompanied 
Alien Children Program. The number 
of kids turning up on our border with 
no parents is soaring, and everyone ex-
pects the numbers to keep climbing. 
Now the Biden administration is re-
portedly planning to reopen the same 
kinds of emergency shelters over which 
Democrats vilified the Trump adminis-
tration a couple of years back. Both 
President Biden and his Secretary of 
Homeland Security have said this week 
they don’t think this is a crisis. Not a 
crisis, they say? Well, if this isn’t a cri-
sis, with unaccompanied kids pouring 
in and exceeding the capacity in a pan-
demic, I would hate to see what one 
looks like. 
The cause of this emergency is not 
some mystery. It is not mysterious at 
all. Everybody knows exactly what 
happened. The new administration ex-
plicitly campaigned on weakening bor-
der security, and 6 weeks in, they have 
reversed the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ pol-
icy, begun letting more people in in a 
haphazard way, and broadcast con-
fusing mixed messages. 
The L.A. Times says: ‘‘Biden immi-
gration policy stirs confusion at Mex-
ico border.’’ They interviewed one 
woman who crossed the Rio Grande 
‘‘on a smuggler’s raft’’ and was only 
briefly detained before being released 
into our country. She explained she 
had specifically come because of the 
new Biden administration: ‘‘That gave 
us the opportunity to come.’’ 
Another reporter put it this way: 
‘‘The message received in Tijuana and 
other 
Mexican 
border 
cities

simpl[e]: Joe Biden was now letting 
people in.’’ 
We are not just talking about the 
fine details of border policy. The big 
backdrop behind this whole discussion 
is the sweeping leftwing amnesty plan 
that the Biden administration unveiled 
before they were even sworn in. They 
want to fast-track 11 million illegal 
immigrants into temporary legal sta-
tus, then green cards, and then full 
citizenship. 
The far left loves this approach, but 
so does a certain cross section of Big 
Business. There is a whole lot of cul-
tural power and economic power push-
ing the liberal vision. As for the best 
interest of American workers, well, 
that is not as trendy a cause in certain 
circles. 
The truth is that it is not helpful or 
compassionate to just open up our bor-
ders. It is not fair to American citizens 
and workers, but neither is it fair to 
the people who are being lured into a 
humanitarian crisis in the middle of a 
pandemic because they believe this 
Democratic administration just con-
spicuously turned on a neon ‘‘Vacan-
cies’’ sign. 
Republicans just spent 4 years mak-
ing major headway on the security and 
humanitarian crisis at our border. It 
took serious policy changes. It took 
international diplomacy with multiple 
countries, and it took border enforce-
ment. 
The American people would be better 
served if the Biden administration had 
chosen to build on this progress instead 
of rapidly trying to tear it down. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is

f 
NOMINATION OF MERRICK BRIAN 
GARLAND 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, history 
was made on Monday. Judge Merrick 
Garland finally got a vote before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. It was a 
long time in coming. His nomination 
was approved by a bipartisan vote of 15 
to 7. I am not surprised. He is superbly 
qualified to be the next Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States. 
With experience, judgment, and in-
tegrity, he checks all the boxes. He 
served with distinction on the DC Cir-
cuit Court for 23 years and, in that 
time, developed a reputation for fidel-
ity to the rule of law, a strict adher-
ence to judicial independence, and a 
commitment to treat people with fair-
ness, dignity, and respect. It is no sur-
prise that he has been endorsed by 60 
former Federal judges and by judges, of 
course, who have been appointed by 
Presidents of both political parties. In 
addition to his experience on the 
bench, he is a longtime veteran of the 
Department of Justice, where he served 
before he ascended to the DC Circuit. 
He is uniquely qualified at this mo-
ment in history to lead the Depart-
ment and to investigate and prosecute, 
for example, the January 6 insurrec-
tion—the mob that invaded this Cap-
itol Building. The reason he is quali-
fied is that he led the investigation and 
prosecution of the Oklahoma City 
bombing. We remember that very well. 
That was clearly a case of domestic 
terrorism. His work on that project 
won praise from across the political 
spectrum. 
He also personally understands the 
Department’s role in protecting civil 
rights. I believe he is the person to re-
store honor and dignity to this Depart-
ment. He has support from every major 
law enforcement organization in the 
country, from 150 former Justice De-
partment officials of both parties, from 
the Nation’s leading civil rights orga-
nizations, and from many others—left, 
right, and center. His credentials are 
second to none, and his character—in 
particular, his selflessness—is a model 
to us all. 
When we held the markup on his 
nomination in the committee, the most 
significant witness may have been a 
lady by the name of Mrs. Tucker. She 
testified on the second panel. She is 
the mother of two DC public school 
students 
who 
were 
tutored 
and 
mentored by Judge Garland. After the 
first child had received his helping 
hand for several years, the second child 
asked if she could be included in the 
next round, and then they both won the 
help of Judge Garland. Doesn’t it speak 
volumes of a man who has reached that 
station in life that he would be so hum-
ble as to sit down and help children 
whom he had never met before find 
their way through life? It was a touch-
ing moment when she testified. It real-
ly was an insight into his character. 
So you would think, with a 15-to-7 
vote, you would think with all of these 
endorsements, and you would think 
that the fact of there being four mem-
bers on the Republican Senate side of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee be-
hind him that this would be a nomina-
tion of an Attorney General so impor-
tant to this Nation that it would be 
given expedited treatment on the floor 
of the Senate. No. Unfortunately, there 
was an objection to expediting his 
nomination so he could get to work for 
the Department of Justice, and, as a 
consequence, we face the Senate proce-
dure, which means that it could be 
days, maybe even into next week, be-
fore he can take the job. That is unfor-
tunate. We need him now more than 
ever. Even Republican Leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL has said he would support 
him. CHUCK GRASSLEY, my friend and 
the ranking member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, voted for him. 
There is just no reason the Senate 
should not immediately hold a vote for 
Merrick Garland’s nomination. He is 
the last remaining member of Presi-
dent Biden’s national security team to 
be chosen. It is time for him to take 
this job. The Attorney General is need-
ed to fight the threat of domestic ter-
rorism, which the FBI Director spoke 
to yesterday in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, to reorganize this Depart-
ment and get it moving in the right di-
rection, and to face the many chal-
lenges when it comes to national secu-
rity and the administration of justice. 
We should confirm Merrick Garland 
immediately. I sincerely hope that 
whoever is holding his nomination on 
the other side can be persuaded to give 
him his chance. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on a dif-
ferent subject, I listened to the speech-
es of Senator SCHUMER and Senator 
MCCONNELL about the American Res-
cue Plan—Joe Biden’s proposal, his ini-
tial proposal as President—to deal with 
the pandemic, the state of the econ-
omy, and many other aspects of Amer-
ican culture and life that need to be ad-
dressed. Clearly, there is a difference of 
opinion. 
I couldn’t help but think, as Senator 
MCCONNELL was recounting our experi-
ence last year, that when it came to 
the CARES Act a year ago—the $2 tril-
lion plan to respond to the state of the 
pandemic and the economy, the plan 
that was engineered by Treasury Sec-
retary Mnuchin, a member of the 
Trump administration, who argued and 
negotiated 
with 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats alike—that, when they fi-
nally agreed, the vote was 96 to noth-
ing in this Chamber. Every Democrat 
voted for the proposed CARES Act that 
was engineered by the Trump adminis-
tration. Party was pushed aside be-
cause the priority was our Nation. It 
happened again in December of last 
year. In President Trump’s administra-
tion, with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin 
at the table and with Democrats and 
Republicans bargaining, the final vote 
was 92 to 6 in the Senate—not bad—and 
the 6 noes were all Republicans. Again, 
the Democrats stepped up and said: We 
will support this bipartisan effort be-
cause that is why we are here. The 
American people sent us here to do a 
job. 
Now comes the new President, Joe 
Biden, who says: Good work last De-
cember, but that was temporary, and 
that was supposed to be a special ef-
fort. Now we have to finish the year. 
We have some deadlines coming. Just 2 
weeks from now—or in less than 2 
weeks—the unemployment insurance 
programs will be running out for mil-
lions of Americans, and the rental as-
sistance program as well. Some will 
face eviction, and some will not have 
enough money to feed their families. 
So get to work. Pass the American 
Rescue Plan on a bipartisan basis. 
We have yet to hear from one Repub-
lican Senator who will support Presi-
dent Biden’s plan. Some of them have

legitimate differences with his policy, 
and I wish they would come to the 
table and be a part of the conversation, 
but none of them has really stepped up 
and said: We are in for the big effort 
that the President is calling for. That 
is what it will take. Unfortunately, be-
cause of that, in a 50–50 Senate, we will 
need every Democratic Senator to sup-
port the President’s plan and to pass a 
version of what the House is sending 
over to us. We will go through an exer-
cise called ‘‘reconciliation’’ in just a 
few days. It is not a pretty scene if you 
follow legislative history, but it is long 
overdue. 
Do you know the one thing that 
should drive us on? It is not only the 
obvious need for this but the fact that 
the American people overwhelmingly 
support what President Biden has pro-
posed. The American people believe, as 
he does, that we should be investing 
billions into more vaccines and more 
people to administer them. The Amer-
ican people believe that a cash pay-
ment to families is essential in some 
parts of this country. They would like 
to see the $600 in last December’s bill 
complemented with the $1,400 in this 
proposal. They would like for us to put 
money on the table for people who are 
unemployed so they can put food on 
that same table, and they would like 
for us to get the schools ready to deal 
with reopening and classes that are 
safe for the kids and the teachers. 
There is no argument about that. 
While 20 percent of the people may 
oppose it, 80 percent support it. Yet we 
can’t find one Republican Senator to 
support President Biden’s plan. They 
say it costs too much. Well, the Chair-
man of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Pow-
ell, a conservative Republican econo-
mist, has told us to be careful that you 
do too little. This economy is fragile. 
It needs to be strengthened. We need to 
inject into this economy enough of our 
resources so that people are back, pur-
chasing again, and businesses are re-
opened. He has warned us, if you do too 
little and if you cut it off too soon, you 
are going to pay for it for years to 
come with unemployment and prob-
lems with the sluggish economy. 
My Republican colleagues say it is 
just too much money. Well, I think 
they are wrong, and at this moment in 
history, I am prepared to err on the 
side of investing in the American peo-
ple and American businesses and mak-
ing certain that we have a fighting 
chance to put this behind us. 
Our constituents know about the cost 
of this situation. They want us to pro-
vide the solutions. They want results 
from Congress. If we were to delay this 
payment, people would see their unem-
ployment insurance lapse and hard-
ships continue. 
We shouldn’t play politics with it ei-
ther. In the two big bills last year, the 
Democrats were on board for plans en-
gineered by the Trump administration. 
Economists believe that we need to 
move and move decisively. 
According to an analysis by the 
Brookings Institution, passing a com-
prehensive plan like the American Res-
cue Plan could produce a 4-percent 
growth in U.S. GDP this year. 
Moody’s estimates that passing the 
same plan would create 71⁄2
million 
American jobs. How about that? 
We got good news over the weekend 
with the arrival of another safe and ef-
fective vaccine. This is the third one, 
the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, in our 
arsenal—perhaps more to follow. It 
holds the promise of finally getting 
America inoculated, vaccinated, and 
breaking the back of this pandemic. 
This 
new 
vaccine 
prevents 
hos-
pitalizations and deaths, stored at nor-
mal temperatures, a single shot—all 
good news. 
But we need more than a promise of 
a vaccine. We need a plan. These vac-
cines are of no good to us sitting on a 
shelf or not being produced in volumes 
necessary. 
President Biden’s rescue plan, which 
not 
a 
single 
Republican 
supports, 
would provide 100 and—I think I have 
got the number right—$160 billion in 
resources for the production of vac-
cines and the distribution. If we ever 
needed it, this was the moment. 
Thankfully, President Biden’s leader-
ship has led to allocations to Illinois of 
vaccines that have increased by 70 per-
cent since he took over as President. 
We still have our challenges at the 
local level. 
I want to salute the Governor, JB 
Pritzker; the mayor of the city of Chi-
cago, Lori Lightfoot; the Cook County 
Board President Preckwinkle; and all 
the others who are doing their best. 
I 
announced 
with 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH just last Friday that we 
are going to put a new facility in the 
parking lot of the United Center, where 
the amazing Chicago Bulls play basket-
ball from time to time, and it is going 
to be able to vaccinate thousands of 
people every single day. 
It is Federal assistance that is mak-
ing it happen, and it happens to be in a 
neighborhood where African Americans 
and Latinos are nearby, and we need to 
protect them with even more effective-
ness than we have to date. They ac-
count for 33 percent of the population 
of that area, and only 16 percent have 
been vaccinated. 
The American Rescue Plan provides 
$20 billion to expand our vaccine dis-
tribution capacity. You would think 
that that would maybe attract one Re-
publican supporter. It should. There 
are certainly some who argue against 
all vaccines and spending any money 
for it and all the rest, but they are 
such a small minority. The vast major-
ity of Americans of both political par-
ties understand that we have got to go 
to vaccinations as quickly as possible. 
The Biden rescue plan does that. I wish 
they would join us in supporting it. 
There is also a need for money for 
education. There is $128 billion in this 
bill for additional education funding K– 
12, and there have been arguments 
made on the floor here by the Repub-
licans that we just don’t need it. They 
point to data showing that the school 
districts haven’t spent the money that 
we provided in previous relief pack-
ages. Well, just talk to the principals 
and the teachers in your home State 
about that conclusion. You will find 
the money is desperately needed and 
that the money that has been appro-
priated before will be spent in an or-
derly way and not shoveled out the 
window. 
We are looking ahead to the entire 
year and making certain that we have 
a real school year—perhaps the remain-
der of this year but certainly for next 
year. Illinois needs these funds and 
America does. 
When it comes to State and local 
support, I have to tell you, we have 
paid a heavy price in our State of Illi-
nois and our major cities. We have seen 
expenses go up and we have seen rev-
enue go down and we need help, not un-
reasonable. 
This helping hand will save jobs that 
are necessary for us—some of them 
healthcare jobs, some of them security 
and safety jobs, but they will save jobs, 
and that is why the State and the local 
resources included in this bill are so 
important and timely. 
Over the past year, States and local-
ities have lost 1.3 million jobs of their 
payrolls, far more than the 750,000 lost 
in the great recession. There is needed 
help from the Federal Government, and 
it is needed now. 
We have recovered just 12 million of 
the 22 million jobs we have lost since 
the start of the pandemic. 
According to the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, more than 8 million 
rental households and 2 million home-
owners were behind on housing pay-
ments at the end of last year. The bur-
den is tough, and for those of us lucky 
enough to have escaped it, we may not 
know the feeling, the empty feeling of 
eviction or the loss of a home that you 
have paid a mortgage on for years. 
I am going to close. I see one of my 
colleagues on the floor preparing to 
speak, but I would like to close with 
the 
story 
of 
Galen 
Hensen 
from 
Midlothian, IL. 
For 34 years, Galen has supported 
touring artists through his work in live 
concert production for some of Amer-
ica’s most iconic musicians. When the 
American economy was upended by the 
pandemic, his industry froze to save 
other lives and to avoid crowds. 
Like so many others, Galen went on 
unemployment. Yet, even with the 
Federal $600 supplement to State un-
employment, he had only half of his 
regular income replaced. He struggles— 
still struggles to make ends meet. He 
wrote to me urging that we put aside 
our partisan differences and pass the 
American Rescue Plan. Let’s listen to 
Galen, and let’s listen to many others 
like him. They are counting on us. 
I hope when all is said and done after 
all the speeches, that just as we came 
together on a bipartisan basis to pass 
the rescue plan twice last year—96 to

nothing, 92 to 6—under the Trump ad-
ministration, with all Democrats sup-
porting it, wouldn’t it be great if we 
showed that same bipartisanship again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
f 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, less than 
2 months ago, President Biden empha-
sized a theme of unity at his inaugura-
tion. 
‘‘Today, on this January day, my 
whole soul is in this,’’ he said. ‘‘Bring-
ing America together. Uniting our peo-
ple. And uniting our nation.’’ 
Admirable words, but so far they 
haven’t been met with much action. On 
the first big legislative test of his Pres-
idency, coronavirus legislation, Presi-
dent Biden and Democrats in Congress 
have pursued a resolutely partisan 
course. 
They have not only failed to invite 
Republican input in any meaningful 
way, they deliberately excluded it by 
passing 
their 
coronavirus 
package 
using budget reconciliation. 
This allows them to pass the bill in 
the Senate by a simple majority vote, 
instead of requiring the concurrence of 
60 Senators to move to a vote on the 
bill, which is typically how legislation 
is passed here in the Senate, including 
the five coronavirus bills that we 
passed last year, when the Republicans 
had the majority here in the Senate. 
Now, Democrats’ decision to use rec-
onciliation might be understandable if 
Republicans had declared our opposi-
tion to any further coronavirus legisla-
tion, but, of course, that is not the 
case. 
Republicans made it clear that we 
were willing to work with Democrats 
on additional coronavirus legislation. 
In fact, 10 Republican Senators put to-
gether a plan and met with President 
Biden for 2 hours to discuss a bipar-
tisan agreement. But while the Presi-
dent 
listened 
to 
them 
graciously, 
Democrats and the President quickly 
made it clear that they intended to 
move 
forward 
without 
Republican 
input. 
Two days after Republicans met with 
President Biden, the House passed its 
partisan budget resolution to pave the 
way for reconciliation here in the Sen-
ate. Two days later, the Senate fol-
lowed suit. 
Clearly, there were no plans to let 
negotiations with Republicans slow 
down the partisan juggernaut. In fact, 
Democrats have been pretty deter-
mined to make sure Republicans don’t 
have a voice in this legislation at all. 
During markups of the COVID relief 
package in House committees, Repub-
licans offered a number of amend-
ments: 245 amendments, to be exact. 
Out of those 245 amendments, Demo-
crats accepted exactly one for the final 
bill—one. 
Among 
the 
amendments 
House 
Democrats rejected were commonsense 
proposals to tie school funding to the 
reopening of schools. There was an 
amendment to unfreeze funding for the 
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 
for farmers and ranchers. There were 
amendments to target funding to over-
looked 
rural 
communities 
and 
an 
amendment to protect healthcare pro-
viders from frivolous lawsuits. 
The one thing that can be said for 
the House is at least it gave Members 
in the House a chance to review the bill 
in committee. Here in the Senate, 
Democrats’ COVID package will come 
to the floor without any committee 
consideration. Senators are just sup-
posed to accept whatever the House 
sent over or whatever changes the Sen-
ate Democratic leader makes, minus 
those items that are excluded from a 
reconciliation package by Senate budg-
et rules. 
Democrats’ 
partisan 
course 
on 
COVID legislation is particularly dis-
appointing 
because 
up 
until 
now, 
COVID relief has been a bipartisan 
process. 
That is right. To date, Congress has 
passed five COVID relief bills, and 
every single one of those bills was over-
whelmingly bipartisan. 
The Republican-led Senate took up 
and passed COVID relief legislation by 
margins of 96 to 1, 90 to 8, 96 to 0, 92 to 
6, and one even went by voice vote here 
in the Senate. 
Back then, of course, Democrats 
thought that the minority party should 
have a voice in the process. In fact, the 
Democratic 
leader 
filibustered 
the 
original 
CARES 
Act, 
our 
largest 
COVID bill to date, multiple times 
until he got a version that he was sat-
isfied with. 
Now that the Democrats are in the 
majority, however, they have decided 
minority representation can be dis-
pensed with. It is Democrats’ way or 
the highway on COVID legislation. Re-
publicans and the Americans that they 
represent will not be allowed to con-
tribute. 
I guess it is not surprising. After all, 
if the Democrats had pursued a bipar-
tisan process, they would probably 
have had to eliminate some of the non- 
COVID-related provisions in this legis-
lation, like the $86 billion bailout of 
multiemployer pension plans, hardly a 
coronavirus emergency. 
They might have been forced to trim 
their slush fund for States and ensure 
that the distribution formula wasn’t 
weighted heavily in favor of blue 
States. 
The Senator from Illinois was just 
down here talking about the impor-
tance of helping out the States. Well, 
under the formula that they have de-
signed for this relief package, the dol-
lars skew heavily, surprisingly, to 
States like New York, where the Demo-
cratic leader is from, or California, 
where the House Speaker is from, or Il-
linois, where the Senate Democratic 
whip is from. 
It seems like a lot of States around 
the country sort of got left out when it 
came to how to distribute what is 
going to be a huge amount of money 
that is going to go out to State and 
local governments if the Democrats 
have their way with this bill. They 
might have had to reject the measure 
to give labor unions and Planned Par-
enthood access to loans designed to 
help small businesses—again, hardly 
something that we ought to be doing in 
a coronavirus relief bill that is de-
signed to make sure that small busi-
nesses stay viable, but it does satisfy a 
lot 
of 
Democrat 
special 
interest 
groups. 
They might have had to tie funding 
for schools to school reopening—seems 
like a fair consideration. There was an 
amendment offered during the budget 
resolution when it was being consid-
ered on the floor of the Senate that 
would have required schools where 
every teacher had the vaccination to 
reopen in order to qualify for Federal 
assistance under this legislation, but 
there is nothing about that in this bill. 
There is nothing that, of all the 
money, the $128 billion that will go out 
to schools—by the way, we put $68 bil-
lion out there already, much of which 
hasn’t been spent. But with all this 
money that would go out to schools, 
there is no stipulation anywhere in 
this legislation that would attempt to 
tie funding for schools to their reopen-
ing so that we can get our kids back to 
school and learning again in that envi-
ronment. 
In fact, it would be arguable, I think, 
that the schools, if the teachers can 
get vaccinated—and that was the very 
language of the amendment that was 
offered in the budget resolution by Re-
publicans. It was defeated here in the 
Senate on a 50–50 vote. All Republicans 
voted for it, all Democrats against it. 
But again, all it simply said was that if 
you are going to get Federal funding 
under this bill and all of the teachers 
in your school are vaccinated against 
the coronavirus, then you have to re-
open. If you don’t reopen after all the 
teachers have been vaccinated, then 
you don’t get funding under this bill. 
That seems like a fairly straight-
forward request, given the fact that so 
many schools across this country and 
so many of our kids continue to have 
to learn virtually at a time when we 
need to have them in the classroom. 
This 
is 
obviously 
something 
that 
wasn’t included in this legislation. 
I would argue that all the changes 
that I have just mentioned would have 
made the bill better, but they might 
not have made the Democrat allies as 
happy. This whole process could have 
been different. We could be here today 
with another bipartisan COVID bill 
that would speed up vaccination and 
help our country through the rest of 
the pandemic. In fact, as I said, there 
were lots of Republicans who were in-
terested in negotiating, sitting down 
with Democrats to do just that. 
The Democrat whip, the Senator 
from Illinois, was down here saying: 
Wouldn’t it be great if this could be bi-
partisan like the other bills we have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1005 
March 3, 2021 
done earlier that were bipartisan? I 
would simply point out the obvious, 
and that is that all of the bills that 
were done last year when Republicans 
had the majority here in the Senate 
were bipartisan because we did them 
under regular order. We did them under 
the 60-vote threshold that is required 
to move legislation through the Sen-
ate. 
What the Democrat leadership has 
opted to do is to use a rarely used leg-
islative vehicle here—budget reconcili-
ation—to do a bunch of things that 
they could do simply with 51 votes, and 
it was pretty clear to me that they had 
no intention ever of including Repub-
lican ideas or involving Republicans in 
developing this legislation or, ulti-
mately, having Republican support for 
at the end. In fact, that was probably 
made most clear by a statement made 
by the Chief of Staff to President Biden 
in the White House when he described 
this as ‘‘the most progressive domestic 
legislation 
in 
a 
generation,’’ 
sug-
gesting, of course, that this is filled 
with all kinds of liberal priorities, 
most of which have very little to do 
with the coronavirus. 
In fact, if you look at where the fund-
ing goes in this, the $1.9 trillion, less 
than 10 percent—less than 10 percent— 
deals 
with 
funding 
for 
public 
healthcare; in other words, funding for 
vaccines, either for production or dis-
tribution; funding for providers; fund-
ing more mental health; funding for 
anything related to healthcare. If you 
look at the $1.9 trillion, it is less than 
10 percent. Less than 10 percent of it is 
actually directed at addressing the ac-
tual healthcare crisis that we are fac-
ing as a nation. 
I would simply say that it is pretty 
clear to me that if Democrats had 
wanted to, they could have had—easily 
could 
have 
had—a 
bipartisan 
bill. 
There are 10 Republicans I know of 
today who would have voted for a bill 
that would include funding for vac-
cines, that would include funding for 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, 
that would include funding for unem-
ployment checks, that actually would 
have included funding for direct checks 
to go out, which I know is a very pop-
ular thing. But that consultation never 
occurred. That desire to get input 
never happened—that offer to allow the 
committees of jurisdiction to even 
have a voice or any input into this. 
Frankly, if I am a Democrat here in 
the Senate, I would be outraged that 
my committees were bypassed com-
pletely. There was no consideration at 
any committee—any committee—here 
in the Senate about what the contents 
of this legislation should be or what 
the substance of it should look like in 
the end. It was literally ramrodded, 
coming from the House of Representa-
tives, taken up by the Democratic lead-
ership with no input from the commit-
tees—Republicans, for sure, but also 
Democrats, of all people, who you 
think would want to be heard. I mean, 
they got these chairmanships of these 
committees for a reason. They finally 
got the majority, and they have com-
mittee gavels and all that, and here we 
are, talking about $1.9 trillion in 
spending, and the committee chairs, 
the committees themselves had no ac-
tion when it comes to shaping or in 
any way producing this legislation. 
So to suggest, as the Democrat whip, 
Senator DURBIN, did earlier, that he 
really hopes that this will be bipar-
tisan, I just—it is hard to take that 
even seriously, given how this is pro-
ceeding and how the Democrats opted 
to do this relative to how the other five 
coronavirus relief bills were passed last 
year under the Republican majority. 
We are looking instead at a partisan 
bill that directs billions of taxpayer 
dollars to projects and policies that 
have nothing to do with overcoming 
COVID. And just as one observation— 
again, I made this point on the floor 
yesterday. But one thing that we need 
to remember here is that we are talk-
ing about real money here, and we are 
talking about it all being borrowed 
money. This is all money that goes on 
the debt. Every dollar that we are 
going to provide of the $1.9 trillion that 
is proposed in this Democrat bill is a 
borrowed dollar. These are all dollars 
that go on the debt, the debt which has 
grown dramatically in this last year, in 
some cases because we had to move ag-
gressively, as we did last year at this 
time in March with a bill that would 
get immediate assistance out there to 
people who desperately needed it. We 
were fighting at that time a major 
emergency, a major crisis. Well, here 
we are, a year later. We have a very 
different perspective on the world 
today than we did 12 months ago. But 
that $1.9 trillion, when added to the 
other coronavirus relief bills, ends up 
being about $6 trillion—$6 trillion. 
That amount of money is absolutely 
hard to comprehend and hard to fath-
om. 
And 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
compounding the $4 trillion or so al-
ready out there with another $2 trillion 
with this bill, and as I pointed out yes-
terday, at some point—at some point— 
the chickens come home to roost. You 
cannot continue down this path with-
out consequence on the economy. 
Now, the argument in support of this 
legislation made by Democrats is that 
we need to do more; we have got to get 
this out there; we have got to stimu-
late the economy. My fear in a lot of 
respects right now is that the economy 
could be overstimulated. The Congres-
sional Budget Office said just recently 
that without any additional assistance, 
the economy is going to grow in 2021 at 
3.7 percent, and we are flooding the 
zone with so much money that the 
money supply numbers have been ex-
ploding. 
The 2020 money supply was up—the 
M2 as they measure it—was up 26 per-
cent. Year over year, from 2000 to 2019, 
it averaged about 6 percent. This year 
it is going to be up another 12 percent. 
There is a lot of money out there in the 
economy. What does that mean long- 
term for our economy and for the indi-
vidual workers in our economy? Well, 
first off, it means that as there are 
more and more dollars chasing fewer 
goods, you are going to get inflation. 
That is inevitable. When you get infla-
tion, typically what happens is interest 
rates follow because those who are buy-
ing that debt, if it is being lost to infla-
tion, want to make sure that they are 
getting a return on their investments, 
so interest rates start to go up. 
When interest rates go up, the 
amount of money we borrow becomes 
even more expensive because we have 
to pay interest. We have to finance 
that debt. So the amount of interest— 
the amount of Federal tax dollars that 
we will be using to pay for interest on 
the debt will explode and will swamp— 
it will swamp, literally—the amount of 
tax revenue coming into this country. 
We know that because the debt is so 
large already, and we know that be-
cause interest rates have been low for a 
long time, which has lulled everybody 
into a sense of complacency that this is 
not going to have any impact, that 
there is no downside. We can just keep 
borrowing because interest rates are 
low. 
Well, if you keep putting as much 
money out there as we are—another $2 
trillion out into the economy—I would 
argue that you are not only going to 
unleash inflation, which has a dra-
matic consequence for our fiscal situa-
tion as a country, but it also has a dra-
matic consequence for the personal fi-
nancial situation of the American fam-
ily because when inflation takes off, 
everything that people have to buy, 
from food to gasoline to clothing—all 
those things go up. Inflation pushes the 
prices of things higher, which means 
they are more expensive to the average 
family in this country. 
Then the other effect, long-term, is 
when inflation starts to go up, as I 
said, interest rates start to follow. We 
are already starting to see some evi-
dence of that. When interest rates go 
up, not only does the Federal Govern-
ment fiscal picture get much, much 
worse because the amount of tax dol-
lars that we have to spend to finance 
our debt grows dramatically, but the 
American consumer is also faced with 
higher interest rates. So mortgage pay-
ments go up if somebody is trying to fi-
nance a home. Interest rates on cars, 
automobiles, will go up. Interest rates 
on student loans go up. That also has a 
direct impact on the pocketbooks of 
people in this country. 
Mr. President, I am going to con-
clude, but I think it is really important 
to point out—and I know that my 
State is not indicative of every State 
around the country. There are States 
that have legitimate, different finan-
cial situations. But in South Dakota 
right now, we have 3-percent unem-
ployment. We have a growing economy. 
We have a State that has already bene-
fited 
significantly 
from 
earlier 
coronavirus relief legislation to the 
point where there are dollars that they

March 3, 2021 
are still trying to figure out how to use 
from the previous installations of Fed-
eral spending that we have put out 
there. It just seems to me that we 
ought to, given the potential adverse 
consequence of higher interest rates, 
higher inflation, higher debt and spend-
ing, think about that what we are 
doing here should be very targeted. It 
should be very specific. 
We know now—we have a lot more in-
sight into where the needs are in the 
economy than we did at this point last 
year, in March, when we did the first 
CARES package. We are at a time now 
when it is very clear where those needs 
are, and we could come up with a much 
more targeted bill. Those 10 Repub-
licans that I have mentioned have 
come up with a bill that is in the $600 
billion to $700 billion range, which ad-
dresses the healthcare issues, addresses 
the unemployment insurance issues, 
addresses the PPP program. It deals 
with direct checks, as I mentioned. It 
has got funding for education. I think 
some funding is in there for State and 
local governments, which, frankly, as I 
said, I am not for. I would rather see us 
take those dollars, if we are going to 
put them somewhere, put them toward 
something that is more targeted, at 
least a formula that makes more sense. 
But let me just say that in my view 
it is really important right now that 
we be circumspect. We are talking 
about borrowed money. This is now— 
this is the house of dollars. This is 
not—this isn’t just magic money that 
appears out of nowhere. Every single 
dollar that we are using is borrowed, 
will be added to the debt, will be a li-
ability for somebody to have to pay 
back—for our kids and our grandkids. 
And if the potential economic impacts 
that I mentioned actually occur and in-
terest rates start to tick up, it is going 
to be a lot more expensive money to fi-
nance in the future, and I think that is 
a very real consideration. It is some-
thing we ought to be thinking long and 
hard about, not just because of the fis-
cal situation that the country faces 
right now but because of the financial 
situation every American family, as 
they sit around the kitchen table and 
talk about these pocketbook issues, 
will be looking at. If we see higher in-
flation, if we see higher interest rates, 
it is going to affect their jobs; it is 
going to affect their cost of living; and 
it is going to make it that much harder 
for them to make ends meet. 
Less than 2 months after the Presi-
dent committed himself to unity at his 
inauguration, the first major bill of his 
Presidency will be a resolutely par-
tisan piece of legislation. I hope—I 
hope—that this is not a sign of things 
to come.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this week, my Democratic colleagues 
are poised to push through the Senate 
here an untargeted and unfocused $1.9 
trillion tax and spending package, and 
it is all being done under the guise of 
COVID relief. Some of it is very essen-
tial for COVID relief but a small part 
of it. 
This whole act is very unfortunate 
because it didn’t have to be this way. 
In the past year, Republicans and 
Democrats were able to work together 
to pass more than $4 trillion in COVID 
relief, and it was all done with strong 
bipartisan support. 
From the start of this year, my Re-
publican colleagues and I have stood 
ready to engage in good-faith, bipar-
tisan negotiations to provide further 
targeted relief. However, despite all 
the talk of unity and bipartisanship by 
President Biden, the new Senate ma-
jority hasn’t even attempted to reach 
across the aisle. Bipartisanship worked 
5 times over the last 12 months, start-
ing about 1 year ago right now. 
The majority, demonstrating their 
unwillingness to compromise, has re-
sorted to using special budget proce-
dures so that they may pass a partisan 
bill strictly along party lines. The re-
sult is going to be an unwieldy, nearly 
$2 trillion package that isn’t shaped ac-
cording to current economic realities 
but strictly by a partisan liberal agen-
da. 
In February, the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office, CBO, pro-
jected that even without any further 
stimulus, gross domestic product will 
return to its prepandemic levels by 
mid-2021, and, for the year, the econ-
omy will grow at 4.6 percent. 
If those two points aren’t strong 
enough, it was recently reported that 
retail sales jumped 5.6 percent during 
January, and the National Retail Fed-
eration is projecting retail sales for the 
year to grow at the fastest rate in two 
decades. 
If those four points aren’t enough, at 
the same time, personal income is re-
ported to have risen by 10 percent, and 
the personal savings rate has surged 
from a historically high 13.4 percent to 
over 20 percent. 
The American economy will soon be 
roaring without a $2 trillion further 
stimulus. It is no longer March of 2020 
when the economy was in free fall and 
businesses and places of employment 
were shut down. And how were they 
shut down? By those of us right here in 
the Congress of the United States, the 
Federal Government doing it by gov-
ernment edict. 
While many individuals and certain 
sectors of our economy continue to 
struggle and, of course, deserve a help-
ing hand, others have largely recovered 
and are no longer in need of assistance. 
At this time, instead of $2 trillion, two- 
thirds of it not needed, why not help 
those hurting and not pour gasoline on 
the inflationary fires? A COVID relief 
package should reflect this reality in 
both size and scope. 
Even longtime Democratic econo-
mists, such as Obama’s former Director 
of the National Economic Council, 
have raised concerns about enacting 
nearly a $2 trillion stimulus package at 
this point when we are already in re-
covery. As former Secretary of Treas-
ury Summers—I also referred to him as 
Director of the National Economic 
Council—this is what he says: ‘‘The 
proposed Biden stimulus is three times 
as large as’’ the gap between actual 
and potential output as estimated by 
the CBO. 
Enacting a stimulus unmoored from 
economic reality poses real risks to our 
economy, including inflation and slow-
er economic growth moving forward. In 
fact, a Penn Wharton Budget Model 
analysis of the President’s proposal 
projects the proposed stimulus would 
result in a decrease in both GDP and 
wages in 2022 and over the next 2 dec-
ades. 
While inflation has been subdued in 
recent years, we shouldn’t let that lull 
in inflation lull us into a false sense of 
confidence that we can spend with im-
punity with no consequences. We are in 
unchartered waters with debt held by 
the public exceeding the size of our 
economy and trillion-dollar annual 
deficits. 
Moreover, as economist John Green-
wood and Steve Hanke, professor of ec-
onomics at Johns Hopkins, recently 
warned: 
The money supply will grow by nearly 12 
percent this year. That’s twice as fast as its 
average growth rate from 2000–19. It’s a rate 
that spells trouble—inflation trouble. 
And that is without another round of 
stimulus that we are going to be debat-
ing in the next few days here on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate and probably 
passing before the end of the week. 
Concerns of inflation have been dis-
missed by the White House and by the 
Federal Reserve. This sounds too famil-
iar to those of us who witnessed the 
stagflation of the 1970s. We were told 
by President Nixon and his advisers 
that they could spend their way to 
lower unemployment and economic 
growth without inflation. They were 
wrong. 
The 
Nixon 
administration’s 
mistakes ushered in a decade of disas-
trous inflation. I have said for decades, 
if Nixon did something, we ought to 
learn from it, not repeat it. 
It was with this background of stag-
flation that I first ran for Congress on 
a platform of fighting inflation. Infla-
tion is a regressive stealth tax on every 
single American. It is particularly un-
fair to those who have very little 
money to begin with, and those who 
have lived beneath their incomes to 
save for the future only to see their 
hard work wiped out as the value of the 
dollars that they put away plunges. 
Hopefully, Nixon inflation is only his-
tory never to return.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1007 
March 3, 2021 
But none of us can guarantee that in-
flation won’t return. Not only is the 
size of this stimulus package detached 
from reality; so is the scope. A com-
mon adage for stimulus and economic 
relief measures is that they should be 
timely, they should be temporary, and 
they should be targeted. By this stand-
ard, the Democrats’ stimulus is well 
wide of the mark. 
More than one-third, or about $700 
billion, of the funding in the bill 
wouldn’t even be spent until 2022 or be-
yond, according to the CBO. How does 
anybody know that we need a stimulus 
in 2022 and beyond? By what standard 
does the Biden administration say that 
we are going to need that? And doesn’t 
that have something to do with the 
failure of this bill to accomplish what 
it wants to accomplish, or even the 
need for it, if some of this money won’t 
be spent until the outer years? 
I don’t know about you, but I don’t 
see how spending hundreds of billions 
of dollars years from now is either 
timely or targeted. As these econo-
mists talk about a stimulus, if it is 
going to be any good, it needs to be 
timely and targeted. 
What does all this have to do with 
fighting the pandemic right now, with 
the people hurting right now? Are 
these same people going to be hurting 
in these out years when some of this 
money is going to be spent? If that is 
the case, this brand-new administra-
tion is already admitting that their 
policies of the future are a failure and 
a failure today. 
Nearly a quarter of the package, or 
$422 billion, is dedicated to direct pay-
ments to households with incomes up 
to $200,000, all regardless of whether 
they have lost a job or experienced any 
loss of income. Such untargeted pay-
ments make little sense when just this 
past week it was reported that personal 
income was up 10 percent and personal 
savings rates soared to over 20 percent. 
We clearly shouldn’t be using taxpayer 
dollars to pad the bank accounts of 
those with six-figure incomes when we 
ought to be targeting this toward those 
who are unemployed and those who are 
low income. 
Then we have another $350 billion of 
this package that is going to be allo-
cated to bail out fiscally irresponsible 
States at the expense of States that 
have managed their State budgets 
wisely, like my home State of Iowa. 
This spending is hard to justify given 
recent reports indicating most States 
saw little to no drop in revenue be-
tween 2019 and 2020. And many States 
that were previously projecting short-
falls are now projecting budget sur-
pluses. 
The package also includes hundreds 
of billions of dollars in liberal wish-list 
priorities that have very little to do 
with the current pandemic. This in-
cludes enhancements to refundable tax 
credits, an expansion of ObamaCare 
subsidies, and an $86 billion taxpayer 
bailout of poorly managed pension 
plans. 
On poorly managed pension plans, 
that is something that I have been try-
ing to reform over the last 2 years, and 
reform is necessary, as much as helping 
them with taxpayer dollars. But there 
are absolutely no reforms in this stim-
ulus of those multiemployer pension 
plans. It is simply an $86 billion bail-
out. 
In the case of COVID, there are some 
things that no amount of money can 
address. Until the widespread immu-
nity is achieved, many people will not 
feel comfortable eating out, going to a 
movie, taking in a concert, or traveling 
on a vacation. Spending trillions of 
dollars will not change the attitude of 
those people who are going to still be 
very cautious. 
So here is what I would spend the 
money on—and a lot less money than 
$1.9 trillion. Yes, let’s prioritize fund-
ing for vaccine distribution, assistance 
for the unemployed, and aid for small 
businesses in the struggling sectors. 
And, by all means, let’s open our 
schools. Doing this doesn’t require $2 
trillion. Let’s remove the pork in this 
bill. Let’s set aside the long-term left-
wing wish list and work together as we 
did before in those five bipartisan bills 
over the last 12 months. And they have 
passed both bodies overwhelmingly. 
Several of my Republican colleagues 
approached the White House a few 
weeks ago with a long list of what I 
just said—maybe a longer list of items 
proposed by President Biden that could 
get Republican support with minimal 
tweaks. A bipartisan package along 
those lines could well have passed a few 
days ago. It is still not too late. I hope 
we can make a bipartisan effort happen 
again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
first, I would like to associate myself 
with the outstanding remarks from the 
senior Senator from Iowa, whose long 
experience in this body is one that we 
all look to with great admiration and 
respect. 
When he speaks on this, he is well 
known for his fundamental focus on 
taxpayer dollars and making sure 
money 
isn’t 
wasted, 
making 
sure 
money is directed to the areas where it 
is supposed to go, where it is needed 
the most. When he points out how this 
is a bill basically piled on with pork— 
and he is from Iowa; he knows about 
pork—he points out how misguided this 
effort is, how expensive it is, and how 
misdirected it is. 
I just want to associate myself with 
these wonderful remarks of the senior 
Senator from Iowa, and it is a pleasure 
and a privilege to serve with him. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
also come to the floor today to talk 
about the need for integrity in our 
elections. 
In 2020, the American people voted 
for a 50–50 Senate. We are in that body 
today. And they gave Republicans 
nearly a dozen more seats in the House 
of Representatives. 
In the Presidential election, 37 elec-
toral votes were decided by less than 1 
percent in those States. Without those 
37 electoral votes, President Biden 
would have failed to achieve a majority 
in the electoral college. This was a 
close election. The reason it is a close 
election is it is a closely divided coun-
try. 
I am home every weekend in Wyo-
ming and the two things I hear about 
is, one, this massive bill in front of the 
Senate 
right 
now—a 
$1.9 
trillion 
amount of money that is all going to 
be added to the debt—and the concern 
for that spending. And the other issue 
is the integrity of our elections. 
So we have a close election. We have 
a closely divided country. If you would 
think anything, that should be a man-
date to move to the middle, to find 
common ground, and to work for solu-
tions. It is the kind of things that the 
President talked about in his inaugural 
address on January 20. 
At a time like this, Americans want 
to make sure that our own elections 
are safe and secure and fair. I think 
voters, no matter what their political 
party or predisposition is—I think all 
voters deserve that, and they want it. 
But when Republicans raise ques-
tions about the integrity of the elec-
tion, well, we are attacked, and we 
have seen that now. In fact, earlier this 
very week, the majority leader of the 
U.S. Senate spoke of ‘‘the pernicious 
and nasty guise of election integrity.’’ 
‘‘Pernicious and nasty guise of election 
integrity’’—the majority leader of the 
U.S. Senate. He attacked the motives 
of millions of Americans who want to 
be confident in our elections. Every 
American ought to want to be con-
fident in our elections. 
But it looks like though some Demo-
crats may accuse us of this, many 
Democrats share our concerns. I hear 
that from both sides of the aisle. 
Democrats in Iowa, right now, are 
contesting a congressional race, and as 
I stand here, Democrats in the House 
are considering the most sweeping 
changes—and this is reason I am here— 
to election laws in decades. 
Their bill is nearly 800 pages long. It 
is called H.R. 1, No. 1. To me, that 
means it is their No. 1 priority. Other-
wise, why would they introduce it as 
their first bill and label it as H.R. 1? 
H.R. 1, for Democrats in the House, is 
not the coronavirus. It is not jobs. It is 
not schools. It is a change in the elec-
tion process for the American people 
and is a big mandate coming out of 
Washington. So the No. 1 priority of 
House Democrats is not those key 
issues. Their No. 1 issue is elections 
and changing elections in our country. 
The bill, interestingly, didn’t go 
through a normal committee process as 
bills are supposed to do in the House or 
in the Senate. It went straight to the 
floor—from NANCY PELOSI’s desk to the 
floor of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. Hundreds of pages are in there of

new mandates, and it tells each of our 
States how to hold elections. It doesn’t 
read, ‘‘States, you do it.’’ It tells the 
States how to do it. These aren’t just 
any mandates. These are radical left-
wing mandates that people in my home 
State of Wyoming view as scary and 
say would make the elections less se-
cure. This bill is so radical that an ear-
lier version of it was felt to be too lib-
eral even for the ACLU, and the latest 
version is even more liberal than that. 
I am just going to mention a few of the 
mandates in this bill. 
H.R. 1 would force every State—force 
every State—to give the vote to con-
victed felons. This would not be a State 
choice but a Federal mandate. One 
group of Democrats even tried to give 
the vote to felons who are still in pris-
on right now, but that amendment 
failed. 
H.R. 1 would force every State to 
allow same-day voter registration, on-
line voter registration, and even auto-
matic voter registration. Automatic 
voter registration? Voter registration 
is something somebody should have to 
do, register to vote. If the bill were to 
become law, you would be registered to 
vote 
automatically, 
without 
even 
knowing it, and when the States auto-
matically register you, you are not al-
lowed to find out how they got your in-
formation. They can’t tell you. In ef-
fect, voter registration would be a 
thing of the past. A thing that we all 
did as young people, register to vote, 
would be a thing of the past. 
H.R. 1 forces States to count provi-
sional ballots statewide. So, if you vote 
Democrat in one district and are from 
another district, they will count it as a 
vote for the Democrat in your district. 
Mistakes like this shouldn’t happen, 
let alone should your vote be able to be 
changed from the vote you actually 
cast. 
The bill also doubles down on mail-in 
voting. The problems with that, I think 
people would agree, are obvious. Ama-
zon—and many of us shop on Amazon, 
if not everyone—recently tried to re-
strict mail-in voting for a union elec-
tion at one of its facilities. That is not 
because Amazon has conservative lead-
ership; it is because they say it is hard-
er to secure mail-in voting than it is to 
secure in-person voting. If you want an 
accurate vote, in-person voting is more 
accurate. The reason mail-in voting 
was expanded last year was because of 
the pandemic, but now the Democrats 
want to carve it into stone forever. 
H.R. 1 would also take government 
funding and give it to political cam-
paigns. The American people have 
some thoughts on that. The bill actu-
ally has a 6-to-1 match for campaign 
donations under $200. So, if you were to 
donate $100 to your favorite candidate, 
the Federal Government would take 
taxpayer dollars and give an additional 
$600 of taxpayer money to that can-
didate who just got a $100 check. Hard- 
working people would pay their taxes 
knowing that their hard-earned dollars 
would go to fund political activity, 
even activity that they would not nec-
essarily agree with. 
Like so many liberal government 
programs, this is a system that could 
easily be defrauded. We see that now 
with the coronavirus bill as well. The 
Democrats know that they would still 
get their big corporate donations in 
New York and in San Francisco, but 
now they would get an added bonus—a 
6-to-1 match—from taxpayers. 
H.R. 1 would also give government- 
funded vouchers for people to donate to 
political campaigns. Political cam-
paigns do not need taxpayer subsidies. 
People can decide how they want to 
spend their own money. The govern-
ment shouldn’t be redirecting it toward 
the party in power. The Democrats 
complain about money in politics all of 
the time. The solution, in seeing H.R. 
1, apparently, is for there to be more 
money in politics as long as it is the 
taxpayers’ money. 
H.R. 1 ends the equal balance be-
tween the Republicans and Democrats 
on the Federal Election Commission. It 
ends it. The Democrats want to politi-
cize the Commission that enforces our 
election laws. They want to make it a 
partisan organization. That is just an-
other idea that would make it easier to 
commit fraud. 
H.R. 1 doesn’t just politicize the Fed-
eral Election Commission; it politicizes 
the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS. 
The Democrats want to break down the 
guardrails that currently keep the IRS 
out of politics. H.R. 1 gets rid of any of 
the limits on the IRS when giving tax 
exemptions to nonprofits. Now, think 
about this. Remember the scandal at 
the IRS under the Obama-Biden admin-
istration—a scandal, headlines. People 
are well aware. Well, H.R. 1 enshrines 
that into law. H.R. 1 gives a big stamp 
of approval to Lois Lerner and her be-
havior in the way she worked the IRS. 
Every Democrat who votes for the bill 
is saying that he or she will endorse 
what happened at the IRS under Presi-
dent Obama. 
There is more, a lot more. The bill 
goes on and on. It is 800 pages. It is 
hard to believe too many Democrats 
have actually read it. 
The bottom line is this: H.R. 1 would 
not reform our elections; it would de-
form our elections, change them dra-
matically. H.R. 1 makes our elections 
harder to secure, easier to defraud, and 
will cast doubt on every election into 
the future. That is the last thing we 
need in this country. 
This is no time to sow doubt about 
our elections. People want confidence 
in the elections. That is why I am 
joined with Senator SCOTT of Florida, 
Senator HYDE-SMITH, and Senator LUM-
MIS to introduce a better proposal. Our 
bill would make our elections safe and 
secure and fair. It would give people 
more confidence in our elections. 
Our bill says: no automatic registra-
tion. The House bill repeals all voter 
ID laws. Our bill says, if you want to 
register to vote, let’s make sure you 
are a citizen. We need to make sure of 
your identification. Let’s make sure 
you have a Social Security number. 
Those are the sorts of things to provide 
integrity in the election process. 
Under our bill, States can’t just send 
out ballots in the mail based on old in-
formation, 
and 
that 
happened 
all 
around the country this year. You can 
still vote by mail. You just need to re-
quest a ballot so your information is 
up to date. It is the way we have done 
it in Wyoming. We send out requests to 
say, if you would like a ballot, apply 
for your absentee ballot, and people do. 
There is no question about the integ-
rity of that system. It was in a number 
of States in which ballots were mailed 
out based on old information and with-
out a request by a voter for that ballot 
that led to so many concerns about the 
abuse and fraud. 
Our bill bans vote harvesting. It 
means you can’t drop off somebody 
else’s ballot. 
The collection boxes they have need 
to be monitored. When you turn in 
your ballot to a ballot box, that ought 
to be monitored. 
When votes are being counted, our 
bill makes sure that both sides are 
watching. 
Our bill prohibits delays or pauses in 
ballot counting. 
We require an audit of ballot count-
ing systems within 30 days after the 
election. 
Now, these are basic, commonsense 
measures to protect against fraud and 
error. You want it to be accurate. You 
want it to be fair. 
The differences between our bill and 
the House’s 800-page bill could not be 
more clear. The Republican bill makes 
it harder to commit fraud. The Demo-
cratic bill makes it easier to commit 
fraud. The Republican bill costs almost 
nothing. The Democratic bill costs bil-
lions. The Republican bill strengthens 
the protections of our elections. The 
Democratic bill weakens those protec-
tions and even gets rid of some of 
them. 
This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. 
We should all be against voter fraud. 
We should make it as hard to commit 
fraud as we possibly can. So I urge my 
colleagues to join me with Senators 
SCOTT
and LUMMIS
and HYDE-SMITH. 
Let us stand for integrity in our elec-
tions. Let us give every American cit-
izen confidence and the peace of mind 
that our system works. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Texas.

That legislation, you will recall, re-

that it was not just a one-off. Each of

March 3, 2021 
signed into law last year received over-
whelming bipartisan support. 
That is not to say that everybody 
was in perfect agreement about the size 
and shape of the bills. We had more 
than our fair share of disagreements 
along the way, but both sides of the 
aisle understood the most pressing 
challenges facing our country and the 
types of support that were needed to 
sustain that fight both when it came to 
public health and when it came to the 
economic fallout and recession that re-
sulted: resources for hospitals and 
healthcare workers, support for the 
hardest hit families, assistance for 
small businesses, and, of course, the de-
velopment, manufacturing, and dis-
tribution of vaccines. Not only did we 
agree on what should be in the bills, 
but we, actually, also agreed on what 
should not be in the bills. 
We were all guided, I believe, by an 
understanding that the focus should re-
main on COVID–19 and that pandemic 
relief bills were no place to inject unre-
lated or partisan preferences, but now 
that our Democratic friends control 
the House and the Senate and the 
White House, they have tossed that 
principle in the trash. 
The Democrats have drafted their so- 
called COVID–19 relief bill without the 
input, the ideas, or the support of a 
single Republican. Now, that is not be-
cause folks on this side of the aisle 
were unwilling. As I remember, there 
were 10 Republican Senators who met 
with President Biden at the White 
House and offered a $600 billion alter-
native that would enjoy broad bipar-
tisan support. This partisan legislation 
was a choice, not a necessity—a choice, 
a conscious choice. 
Last year, the House majority whip 
referred to this crisis as a ‘‘tremendous 
opportunity to restructure things to fit 
our vision.’’ That was Mr. CLYBURN. 
The Democrats knew that a bipartisan 
bill would limit the scope of discus-
sions of policies that were actually rel-
evant to the pandemic. So, rather than 
maintain that relevance to the pan-
demic, they chose to go it alone. This 
opportunity to restructure, as Mr. CLY-
BURN
said, has been months in the 
making, and now that the Democrats 
have the numbers they need to make 
the law without having the support of 
anybody but their own party, they 
have tacked on an entire liberal wish 
list and tried to call it COVID–19 relief, 
but nobody believes it or should believe 
it. 
You see, these are some of the things 
that are in the so-called COVID–19 re-
lief bill of $1.9 trillion when hundreds 
of billions of dollars of money that we 
appropriated just in December haven’t 
even been spent yet. Here is what is in 
the Trojan horse, otherwise known as 
the Democrats’ COVID–19 relief bill: 
funding for climate justice. At a time 
when many Americans are asking 
‘‘When can I get the vaccine?’’ and 
‘‘How long until my children can safely 
return to school?’’ our Democratic col-
leagues are pushing funding to support 
President Biden’s unilateral climate 
Executive orders. 
And then there is the funding—the 
backdoor funding—for Planned Parent-
hood. It is responsible for the most 
abortions of any other organization in 
America. Now, that is a personal 
choice for people to make, but asking 
taxpayers to fund Planned Parenthood 
so it can perform more abortions is 
simply irrelevant to COVID–19 relief. It 
is exploiting another emergency for 
special interest purposes. 
This bill expands the criteria for the 
Paycheck Protection Program, one of 
the 
most 
successful 
parts 
of 
the 
CARES Act that we passed last March. 
It was designed specifically to keep 
small 
businesses 
afloat, 
but 
now 
Planned Parenthood can take advan-
tage of the funding—something they 
were precluding from doing under bi-
partisan agreement previously. 
There is another big political ally for 
our Democratic friends that would be 
newly eligible for these small business 
loans—the labor unions. So now labor 
unions can apply for and receive money 
that was otherwise previously directed 
toward 
mom-and-pop 
businesses 
so 
they could keep their doors open, so 
they could keep their employees on the 
payroll. But now it includes labor 
unions. 
Many of the labor unions’ pension 
plans in particular have been in dire fi-
nancial straits for years, long before 
COVID–19 even existed. Up until now, 
our Democratic colleagues have not 
been able to find a way to bail out 
these mismanaged pension funds. As 
you can imagine, using taxpayer dol-
lars to cover the mistakes of union 
bosses is incredibly unpopular, and 
that is because it is wrong. But the au-
thors of this bill have found a couple of 
workarounds which they have tucked 
into this so-called pandemic relief bill. 
In addition to making labor unions 
eligible for the paycheck protection 
loans, the COVID–19 relief bill also cre-
ates a taxpayer fund to bail out under-
funded union pension funds. That is not 
to help the public generally; that is to 
help labor union members, which is 
certainly their issue. I understand why 
it is important, but I don’t understand 
why my taxpayers in Texas should 
have to bail out underfunded labor pen-
sion funds in other States. Union 
bosses who have mismanaged these 
funds and made bad choices will be re-
warded with a taxpayer-funded check. 
While there is a range of provisions 
to line the pockets of our friends on 
the other side of the aisle across the 
country, the authors of this bill also 
tried to sneak in more localized fixes, 
two 
of 
which 
have 
already 
been 
dropped from this bill. 
In one of the most audacious exam-
ples of tone-deaf Washington politics, 
one of these was an underground rail 
system in the Speaker’s home State of 
California—an underground rail sys-
tem. That has nothing to do with 
COVID–19. 
The Bay Area Rapid Transit expan-
sion has been in the works for years, 
and Californians have raised concerns 
over the rising cost. In 2018, it was pro-
jected to cost nearly $4.7 billion, and 
that estimate has already jumped to 
$6.9 billion from $4.7 billion. 
Despite the fact that this rail system 
has absolutely nothing to do with the 
pandemic and would serve only the 
people of one of the wealthiest areas in 
the country, our Democratic friends 
provided more than $100 million for 
this project in their so-called COVID–19 
relief bill. Well, fortunately, not any 
thanks to our Democratic friends who 
wrote the bill, this completely unre-
lated project has now been removed 
from the bill because it violates Senate 
rules. You are not supposed to be able 
to appropriate money and authorize 
transportation projects in a budget rec-
onciliation bill. That is why it is gone, 
not because our Democratic friends 
were 
embarrassed 
or 
had 
second 
thoughts after it was pointed out to 
them the hypocrisy of including that in 
the bill but because it violates the Sen-
ate rules. 
Another portion of the bill would 
have provided money for a bridge from 
New York to Canada. Let me think for 
a minute which Senator would have 
stuck money for a bridge from New 
York to Canada in the bill. Well, there 
are two Senators, one of whom is the 
majority leader from the State of New 
York. Well, that has now been struck 
by our colleagues because it received 
so much blowback. It was such an em-
barrassing, irresponsible money grab 
that it is no longer in the bill. 
Well, we will see if this trend con-
tinues and more of the completely un-
related partisan projects are elimi-
nated because the long list of unneces-
sary spending does not end there. 
This legislation also establishes a bu-
reaucrat bailout, an exclusive paid 
leave fund just for Federal employees. 
If their kids aren’t in school full time 
because of the pandemic, these employ-
ees could take home up to $1,400 a week 
in paid leave. That is roughly equiva-
lent to $70,000 a year, all to stay home 
and not work. And these benefits would 
last for months. Federal employees 
could take home up to 600 hours of paid 
leave until September 30 even though 
President Biden said every adult who 
wants to get vaccinated will be vac-
cinated by the end of May. This ben-
efit, this ridiculous money grab, would 
last until the end of September, long 
after people had gained antibodies and 
immunity from COVID–19 as a result of 
having been vaccinated. 
Across the country, only about 35 
percent of school districts have re-
turned to fully in-person instruction. If 
the parents of children at the other 65 
percent of school districts happen to 
work for the Federal Government, they 
can claim these benefits. Even if a 
school offers in-person instruction but 
maintains the option to learn vir-

aren’t receiving these same benefits. 
This is clearly cherry-picking to ben-
efit Federal employees, to pay them 
not to work. 
I respect the work that Federal em-
ployees do. I respect the work that all 
government employees do. But to give 
them preferential treatment in the 
midst of this pandemic by paying them 
not to work and using tax dollars from 
other States and other places that 
don’t enjoy that benefit is simply 
grossly unfair. 
Over the last year, countless num-
bers of parents have balanced the im-
possible: work and remote learning for 
their children. It has been hard. I un-
derstand that. Many parents turned 
their kitchen tables into makeshift of-
fices and classroom spaces until their 
children were able to physically return 
to school. Today, less than 7 percent of 
the school districts in Texas are fully 
remote. Seven percent are fully re-
mote, and two-thirds are fully in-per-
son in my State. They have found a 
way to safely return to the classroom. 
There is no reason why the Texans who 
have made that tough juggling act, 
working and learning remotely, should 
now have to pay Federal employees 
who have not had to make that tough 
choice. 
It is simply false advertising to call 
this a COVID–19 relief bill. It is decep-
tive and outrageously so. Only $160 bil-
lion dollars—8 percent of the total 
cost—is directly related to combating 
COVID–19. Eight percent. The rest of 
the bill, as I have tried to point out, is 
a variety of—it is a grab bag, really, of 
partisan priorities, wasteful spending, 
and counterproductive policy. 
What is worse, this restructuring, ac-
cording to Mr. CLYBURN’s language, to 
fit the vision of the Democratic Party 
will cost taxpayers nearly $2 trillion. 
That is on top of the $4 trillion we al-
ready spent last year. Two trillion 
more. 
Well, somebody is going to have to 
pay that money back, and I fear it will 
not be us because we will be long gone. 
It will be our children and grand-
children, and at this rate of reckless 
spending, our great-grandchildren will 
have to be the ones to pay the money 
back. 
This bill is not the answer to the real 
challenges that face our country posed 
by the pandemic. We have shown our 
willingness to work together in a bi-
partisan way to enthusiastically sup-
port the need to provide real relief both 
from the public health consequences 
and the economic fallout associated 
with the virus, but this bill doesn’t 
even attempt to do that. 
Fortunately, as a result of the work 
we did last year, including last Decem-
ber—and by the way, only about 20 per-
cent of the money that we appropriated 
just a few weeks ago—actually, a cou-
ple of months ago in December—has ac-
tually been spent. Only about 20 per-
cent has been spent, and here we are 
being asked to appropriate $1.9 trillion 
more. 
But the good news is, the money we 
spent last year is having real results. 
The money we invested in treatments 
and research and development of vac-
cines and now the distribution of vac-
cines—it is actually making a real dif-
ference. We are vaccinating roughly 3 
million people a day in America. More 
than 70 million people have had shots 
in arms, and we are doing our best to 
try to get it in people’s arms as fast as 
we safely can. President Biden said we 
will get that job done by the end of 
May. That is wonderful news. 
The other wonderful news is that un-
employment rates are going down and 
State revenue is going back up. School 
districts across the country have safely 
resumed in-person learning. One in five 
adults in America has now received a 
dose of the vaccine, and a third vaccine 
has now been approved, so that number 
will climb faster and faster and faster. 
Every day we are moving closer to 
the light at the end of the tunnel, and 
now is not the time to squander the 
good will and trust that the American 
people have had in us to be good stew-
ards of the public health and our econ-
omy by engaging in this sort of embar-
rassing partisan exercise.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I 
wanted to speak in particular terms 
about the American Rescue Plan and in 
particular about the provision of home- 
and 
community-based 
services. 
We 
know that when we speak of these 
kinds of services, we are talking about 
services that benefit seniors across the 
country as well as Americans with dis-
abilities. We are also concerned as well 
for the heroic frontline workers who 
provide those services, most of whom— 
virtually all of whom have been under-
paid and, frankly, underappreciated for 
far too long. 
Let me start with the provision of 
these 
home- 
and 
community-based 
services in terms of the people who are 
benefiting from these services. Right 
now, about 4 million Americans receive 
home care and home health services in 
their own homes or apartments. Re-
ceiving these services at home reduces 
the likelihood that that older Amer-
ican will be infected by the virus. 
Serving and supporting older adults 
and people with disabilities reduces 
pressure on nursing homes and other 
congregate settings. We know that 
these kind of services, the home- and 
community-based services, make sure 
that seniors and people with disabil-
ities have a chance to continue to live 
where they want to live, as opposed to 
living in a congregate setting. In many 
cases, that means they will have more 
contact with their families, reducing 
the loneliness and social isolation that 
can be damaging to their mental 
health. So this American Rescue Plan 
includes temporary Federal funding to 
States to increase Medicaid home- and 
community-based services. 
If the bill were to pass, an additional 
$9.3 billion would be made available to 
States to ensure that workers who pro-
vide these services have the protection 
and resources they need to provide the 
care and to provide the services. 
More than 200 organizations from 
around the country wrote to Congress 
in support of these new dollars. For 
months, SEIU, one of the great unions 
in 
America 
representing 
workers— 
healthcare workers; the disability com-
munity, as well; advocates for older 
adults like AARP and others—have ral-
lied around the need for this funding. 
This funding can be used to increase 
wages for direct-service providers, the 
workers. It can be used to secure addi-
tional personal protective equipment 
and testing supplies for workers and 
those that they support. Home- and 
community-based funds can also be 
used to help people transition from 
congregate 
settings 
back 
to 
their 
homes. It can also be used to provide 
services for the 800,000 Americans wait-
ing for this kind of help. 
For example, Ira Hall from West-
moreland County, PA, just right in the 
southwestern corner of our State, next 
to Pittsburgh, in that county, Ira will 
continue to receive services, and he 
will receive that service from his direct 
service worker, Ray Williams. I was 
able to visit both of these individuals 
last May during a virtual home visit. 
Home- and community-based services 
make it possible for Ira, who has a de-
velopmental disability, to live in his 
own apartment. Ray, who is his direct 
service worker, helps Ira plan his day 
and helps him throughout his workday 
and helps him find the resources he 
needs to meet his goals. 
During the pandemic, Ray’s support 
made it possible for Ira to remain in 
his home and to be safe from con-
tracting the virus. The services Ray 
provides also helps Ira maintain his 
physical and mental health. We know 
that the American Rescue Plan makes 
it possible for services like those Ira 
receives and Ray provides. It will also 
mean the agencies providing these 
services will continue to operate and 
provide essential home- and commu-
nity-based 
services 
throughout 
the 
public health crisis. 
Passage of the bill would be a down 
payment on securing strong and com-
prehensive 
home- 
and 
community- 
based services infrastructure, but it is 
only a down payment. This pandemic 
has revealed a fragile home care and 
home 
health 
system. 
These

should be the first step in creating 
home- and community-based services 
infrastructure that can serve seniors 
and all people with disabilities who 
want to live in their own homes and re-
main in their communities with their 
families, friends, and neighbors. 
With the passage of this American 
Rescue Plan, we will be able to address 
the immediate pandemic needs of older 
adults, as well as people with disabil-
ities. Let’s work to ensure this first 
step starts to create the path to a ro-
bust, comprehensive home care and 
home health network in every State 
for every senior and every American 
with a disability. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Ohio. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
worked with my colleague from Penn-
sylvania on some of these home care 
options, and I think it is a very posi-
tive thing. In fact, it saves a lot of cost 
for the system, but the question is, 
What is it doing in a COVID relief bill? 
You know, I just have to say, having 
been involved in a bipartisan way on 
five different COVID relief packages 
over the last year, I am just so discour-
aged that we can’t sit down, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike, and work 
out a targeted, focused bill on COVID, 
and, by the way, then move on to other 
things, including healthcare reform, in-
cluding issues that traditionally have 
also been bipartisan, like infrastruc-
ture and broadband expansion, like re-
tirement 
security 
or 
dealing 
with 
China and supply chain issues. 
But this is not the way to start. We 
are looking at a $1.9 trillion package, 
the second largest ever written by Con-
gress. The first one went through last 
year. And there was no input—vir-
tually no input—from anybody on our 
side of the aisle because the adminis-
tration decided they didn’t want it. 
They wanted to jam this thing through 
without our participation. And it is too 
bad, because they will end up with a 
product that is not going to be as fo-
cused and targeted, but, also, it is just 
getting off on the wrong foot and mak-
ing it more difficult for us to figure out 
how to come together on other issues. 
It is really the opposite. This process 
is really the opposite of what President 
Biden talked about. He talked about it 
in his campaign. I mean, he won a cam-
paign, including in his primary, saying 
he wanted to work across the aisle; he 
wanted to change the tone in Wash-
ington. That was pretty brave of him 
to say, really. 
And, then, in his inaugural address, 
he did the same thing; didn’t he? He 
talked about the need for unity. He 
talked about wanting to get people to-
gether and to work with Democrats 
and Republicans alike and kind of get 
back to that. This is exactly the oppo-
site of that. I just don’t get it. I have 
to tell you, I am mystified why they 
want to start off this way. 
I was one of the 10 Republicans who 
went down to the White House to meet 
with President Biden about this a few 
weeks ago, and we offered our own pro-
posal and said we would like to work 
with you and negotiate with you. And, 
you know, there has been no interest, 
to be honest, and I wish it weren’t the 
case. 
And $4 trillion has already been allo-
cated to the COVID–19 issue, and it was 
needed. It is a crisis. It still is. It is not 
over yet, although things are getting a 
lot better, both in terms of the 
healthcare crisis and in terms of the 
economy. But we did that, again, five 
different times—over $4 trillion, five 
different times in a bipartisan way. 
So we know we can do it. It is hard 
for us to do it on other issues—let’s 
face it—like taxes or even healthcare, 
but it is not with regard to COVID–19. 
At least it hasn’t been until now. 
The most recent $900 billion COVID 
relief package passed at the end of De-
cember by a 92 to 6 vote—92 to 6. I 
came out to the floor to give speeches 
on this Senate floor over 20 times in 
the months prior to that legislation fi-
nally being passed, urging Congress to 
come out of our partisan corners, 
Democrats and Republicans alike, and 
to come up with a COVID relief pack-
age, because I saw so much middle 
ground. And we found it by the end of 
December. I was part of a group of five 
Democrats and five Republicans who 
sat down over a month-long period or 
so. We actually wrote a bill. The ‘‘908 
Coalition,’’ we called ourselves because 
we wrote a bill for $900 billion that was 
the basis for that $900 billion legisla-
tion that eventually passed. So I have 
been there. I have done it. We have 
done it. We can do it. Yet we are look-
ing here at an entirely different proc-
ess and, unfortunately, a product that 
is not targeted, not focused. 
It is interesting to note that of the 
$900 billion that we appropriated just a 
couple of months ago, at the end of the 
year, more than half of that, we are 
told, has not been spent yet. So while 
we are starting a $1.9 trillion new 
spending project, about half of what we 
just did has yet to be spent. So how do 
we know how much is needed? It is 
very hard to know. 
I will say that it is troubling to me 
that this bill is loaded up with provi-
sions that don’t relate to addressing 
the COVID–19 pandemic, because we 
should be targeted and focused like a 
laser on that issue and not on other 
things. In fact, when you look at the 
healthcare part of this, most people 
would think: OK, what would you do 
with a COVID–19 bill? You would focus 
on the coronavirus. You would focus on 
the testing and the tracing. You would 
focus on the vaccine development and 
distribution. You would focus on the 
healthcare side, including healthcare 
providers. 
Unfortunately, that is a very small 
part of the funding of this bill. It is 
$160 billion out of $1.9 trillion, so less 
than 10 percent of the bill is focused on 
that. And, by the way, the alternative 
I mentioned that we offered to Presi-
dent Biden—$160 billion. We totally be-
lieve in that part of the bill, and that 
we should put all of that in there, par-
ticularly with regard to the vaccines. 
So it is frustrating because not only 
is the process not what we have done in 
the past and is best for this country, 
but also the substance of this bill is 
just not targeted on COVID–19. How do 
I tell hard-working families in my 
State of Ohio that there is a provision 
in the bill that asks Medicare to spend 
more money in New Jersey, Delaware, 
and Rhode Island but not in Ohio and 
other States? How do I explain that we 
need to set aside hundreds of millions 
of dollars that are in this bill in addi-
tional Federal funds for the arts? We 
can have that debate on the arts, but it 
has nothing to do with COVID–19. We 
have the highest deficit, as a share of 
GDP, since World War II—the highest 
debt as a share of GDP. You know, I 
don’t think we should be spending that 
kind of money on things that don’t re-
late to COVID–19. 
Beyond these kinds of unrelated pro-
visions, there are also proposals in this 
stimulus that are directed at impor-
tant issues, but, based on what is need-
ed to respond to the current chal-
lenges, are simply unnecessary and add 
up to more wasteful spending. 
For example, we reached a point in 
this pandemic where the CDC, or the 
Centers for Disease Control, has said 
that schools can start to open safely 
with the right measures in place— 
thank goodness. We want to get our 
kids back to school. That should be a 
cause for celebration. But the plan 
here, the $1.9 trillion, doesn’t reflect 
those findings. Last year, we appro-
priated $113 billion for schools to help 
navigate the pandemic, but, as of now, 
of that $113 billion, only $15 billion has 
been spent. So, roughly, $100 billion is 
left over from last year with regard to 
schools. 
If we are already opening classes 
safely with that amount, why does this 
$1.9 trillion plan instead call for an ad-
ditional investment of $130 billion in 
our schools, but especially when we are 
told that most of that $130 billion will 
not be spent in this calendar year? No-
body thinks that next year, at this 
time, we are going to have the crisis we 
have now, and yet the $130 billion of 
new money will not be spent until the 
end of 2028. 
By the way, the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that 
about half of the funds in the entire 
proposal won’t even be spent in this 
calendar year. That is their analysis— 
objective, nonpartisan. No one expects, 
again, that we will be in this crisis at 
that time. So it just doesn’t seem to 
make sense to me. 
There are other provisions in this bill 
that seem to actually take solutions 
we have come up with in the past 
COVID–19 package and make them 
worse. Unemployment insurance is a 
good example. Republicans and Demo-
crats alike believe there needs to be

March 3, 2021 
some expanded help in terms of those 
who have been hit hardest by the pan-
demic and have lost a job, and the last 
bipartisan 
spending 
agreement 
re-
flected that consensus. But now, after 
finally reaching an agreement on ex-
panded unemployment insurance, one 
that got people the help they need 
without creating a disincentive to 
work, Democrats want to jam through 
another UI proposal that increases the 
$300 per week that we just agreed to in 
December to $400 a week. Now, again, 
that is in the context of the healthcare 
crisis getting better and the economy 
getting better and the unemployment 
numbers going down that we are going 
to put more into unemployment insur-
ance. 
That creates a problem because it 
will mean if you go up to $400 a week, 
then more than half of the workers on 
unemployment insurance will be earn-
ing more on unemployment than they 
would staying employed. We want to 
get people back to work. That is what 
we all should want, at least. So why 
would you do that? We shouldn’t want 
that. It is going to result in fewer peo-
ple getting to work as unemployment 
continues to go down, as the vaccines 
are more widely available. That is the 
opposite of what we should want. 
At the same time, a new provision in 
this bill would allow employees who 
are Federal employees to take 600 
hours of taxpayer-funded emergency 
leave this fiscal year. To put that in 
perspective, 600 hours is about half of 
the total number of working hours re-
maining in this fiscal year. 
There are plenty of problems with 
the way this plan is written. To give 
you one example, a Federal employee 
with children in school would be eligi-
ble for this leave program as long as 
the school is offering a remote learning 
option, even if the kids are going to the 
classroom every day for in-person 
learning. Federal employees would also 
be eligible for this leave if they are 
feeling unwell, even if they don’t have 
COVID–19, and with no oversight, no 
doctor’s note, and no supervisory ap-
proval. 
This is far beyond the responsible bi-
partisan family leave proposal we did 
include, because we should have, in the 
Family First Coronavirus Response 
Act, which offered 80 hours of sick 
leave, about one-seventh of the time 
off in this new proposal, and which ap-
plies to millions of private and public 
sector employees, in addition to the 
Federal employees who are only cov-
ered by this new proposal. 
When none of us knew exactly how 
long we would be faced with the 
COVID–19 crisis, we decided, on a bipar-
tisan basis, that 80 hours was suffi-
cient. But now that we have this new 
proposal, at seven times that leave 
with no test necessary, it is at a time 
when we are actually turning the tide 
on this virus, and we all acknowledge 
that. When more of us are being tested 
and vaccinated, our numbers are going 
down—thank goodness—and we have a 
much better understanding of the dan-
gers of COVID–19. So why does this 
make sense? 
Furthermore, Federal jobs are pretty 
secure. Why should taxpayers pay for 
Federal employees to get 600 hours of 
leave when private sector employees 
are suffering more job losses than the 
public sector? It hardly seems like a 
good use of taxpayer dollars. It is also 
disappointing in this bill, which all of 
us are expected to vote on here in the 
coming days, because the end result is 
so different than the last five. As I 
said, the last five times, we put it to-
gether in a bipartisan basis. 
The process has been frustrating, and 
I know many colleagues who were part 
of the group of five Republicans and 
five Democrats agree with that. We 
are, in effect, for the sake of expedi-
ency and partisan victory, forgetting 
about thoughtful policy and bipartisan-
ship. 
We have to show that we have enough 
Republicans to work with Democrats 
to get this done. I understand that. 
That is why 10 of us went down to the 
White House, because along with 50 
Democrats, that would be 60, which is 
the magic number needed. But there is 
more than 10 Republicans who want to 
work with Democrats. There have been 
every time we have taken this up over 
the past year. 
We proposed the $618 billion counter-
proposal that shares a lot of common 
ground with the Biden plan—not $1.9 
trillion but $618 billion. Again, we take 
care of all the healthcare response to 
the virus. This is in the Biden plan. We 
have a similar approach on stimulus 
checks: Make it a little more targeted, 
which everyone, I think, agrees is a 
good idea. 
Again, with regard to schools, we 
don’t waste the money, which we 
talked about earlier, but we would be 
focused on getting kids back to school. 
The main difference in our bill is we 
take a more targeted approach to ad-
dress the most urgent healthcare and 
economic needs. 
We heed the advice of prominent 
Democratic economist Larry Summers 
and so many others who have now said 
that the $1.9 trillion Biden stimulus is 
not just wasting taxpayer money; it 
risks overheating an already recov-
ering economy, leading to higher infla-
tion, hurting middle-class families, and 
threatening long-term growth. 
But rather than the counterproposal 
leading to this productive type of bi-
partisan negotiations we had last year, 
this time we have been told Democrats 
want to go it alone. 
We will keep talking to the Presi-
dent’s people. We will keep talking to 
Democrats in Congress, hoping they 
will follow through on the campaign 
message and the inaugural promise be-
cause that is what we should be doing 
as a Congress, not just on this issue but 
so many other issues as well. We 
shouldn’t be going it alone. 
Reconciliation has allowed Demo-
crats to take what is essentially a ‘‘my 
way or the highway’’ approach to a re-
sponse package that would be among 
the most expensive pieces of legislation 
in our country’s history. As a result, 
dozens of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle are being shut out of pro-
viding their input on this bill, and we 
are going to be left with a partisan bill 
that fails to meet the most urgent and 
pressing needs. 
In fact, because all of these unrelated 
spending measures we talked about and 
others are directed toward traditional 
Democratic constituencies, I would 
argue that this bill has not just been 
my way or the highway, but it has been 
my way and the highway. 
The bottom line is, at the end of the 
road of this reconciliation process, we 
will have a bill that underdelivers in 
many respects and is overpriced, and 
that is sad to me. It didn’t have to be 
this way. Again, we have done it before 
five times together, made it inclusive, 
listened to each other to come up with 
a bipartisan result. Let’s put a stop to 
this runaway train that is going to add 
to the deficit unnecessarily and put a 
damper on the prospects for the bipar-
tisanship promised by this new admin-
istration. 
Wanting to heal the wounds is some-
thing all of us should want. Wanting to 
work together is something all of us 
should want. Getting back to an era 
where we actually sit down, debate 
things, work them out, and help bring 
the country together is something all 
of us should want. 
I agree with what President Biden 
said in his campaign and the inaugural 
address about the need for unity. Let’s 
do it. Let’s not have rhetoric; let’s 
have action. 
We can work together to get this 
done. We won’t get there if we continue 
to operate like this. It hurts not just 
our new President and his hopes for 
getting things done; it hurts the coun-
try and the ability for us to continue 
to work together to deal with this cri-
sis and get back to a more normal life. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-

f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. RES. 88 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, America is in crisis. Today, the 
Federal debt sits at a staggering $27 
trillion, and it has grown by more than 
$4 trillion in just the last year. Now, 
Congress is debating whether to spend 
another $1.9 trillion, raising our debt 
to nearly $30 trillion. 
Less than 10 percent of this massive 
$1.9 trillion package actually goes di-
rectly to COVID relief, and just 1 per-
cent is dedicated to vaccine-related 
programs. The rest is filled with waste-
ful liberal priorities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1013 
March 3, 2021 
around without a care for what it 
means for our future. It is dangerous, 
and it is time to get serious. 
Congress has the responsibility to 
thoroughly review how every single tax 
dollar is spent by the Federal Govern-
ment and make sure we are spending 
wisely. Sadly, this is rare behavior in 
Washington. 
Congress 
spends 
with 
reckless abandon and rarely considers 
how today’s foolishness will impact our 
children and grandchildren, and we are 
seeing President Biden and Senate 
Democrats continue this dangerous be-
havior. 
For 
them, 
the 
Obama-era 
thinking of ‘‘Never let a crisis go to 
waste’’ is alive and well. 
Estimates show that there is roughly 
$1 trillion in enacted but unspent 
COVID–19 
stimulus 
funding. 
Last 
month, I wrote to President Biden’s 
Acting Director for the Office of Man-
agement and Budget requesting any 
documents related to enacted but cur-
rently 
unspent 
COVID–19 
stimulus 
funding. The response: None. Total si-
lence. 
Here is what that means: The Senate 
has no idea how States are spending 
their allocated funds, and we don’t 
know what the actual needs are. It 
would be completely irresponsible and 
an abdication of our duty as stewards 
of American tax dollars if the Senate 
continues to approve further spending 
without more information. 
That is why my colleagues and I are 
introducing a resolution calling on 
President Biden to inform the Senate 
of how much unspent funds are left 
over from the previous COVID spending 
bills. We want to be very clear. This 
resolution only asks for information 
from the President that will help the 
Senate make an informed decision. 
I am proud to be joined today by Sen-
ator LANKFORD and Senator ERNST to 
ask for transparency. 
It is pretty simple. Ever since the 
pandemic started, I have wanted the 
Federal Government to step in and 
help those who are hurting and have 
lost their jobs. I will completely agree 
that we need to do more to help fami-
lies and small businesses that continue 
to suffer from the impacts of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Relief is needed, 
but it has to be targeted. We have to 
consider our debt and do only what is 
necessary for those in need. 
I grew up in public housing and 
watched my parents struggle to find 
work and make ends meet. I saw my 
dad’s car get repossessed twice. I never 
want a family to go through what mine 
did growing up. But before another dol-
lar is spent, especially dollars going to 
liberal initiatives that have nothing to 
do with COVID relief, there needs to be 
a full and clear accounting of all en-
acted but unspent funding. The deci-
sions we make today have serious im-
pacts on our children and grand-
children. 
But before I continue, I yield to my 
colleagues from Iowa and Oklahoma 
and thank them for their effort. 
I now yield to Senator ERNST. 
Ms. ERNST. Thank you to the Sen-
ator from Florida as well and for shar-
ing his personal story and why it is so 
important that we have transparency 
on bills like this COVID package. 
Over the course of the pandemic, 
Congress has worked together—Repub-
licans and Democrats—to pass five 
overwhelmingly bipartisan bills pro-
viding COVID–19 relief to the American 
people, and I think we would all agree 
that that relief was much needed. 
Now, in March, we passed the largest 
stimulus package in American history. 
And just a few months ago, we passed 
the second largest. But what the Demo-
crats aren’t telling you is that much of 
the $900 billion we passed in the most 
recent relief package, and even some of 
the CARES Act money, has yet to be 
spent. And, frankly, folks, we don’t 
even know exactly who has spent what 
money Congress has doled out over the 
last year. 
I have long said, the American tax-
payer deserves to know where and how 
their money is being spent. Bottom 
line, we need transparency and to know 
what has and has not been spent so far. 
This commonsense effort will help us 
get this information. Until we have 
those details, we should not continue 
throwing money to Washington bu-
reaucrats, and we certainly should not 
support this partisan $1.9 trillion pack-
age that includes many items that are 
completely unrelated to COVID–19. 
I agree with my colleagues that there 
is more that we can do to help expedite 
the vaccine distribution and promote 
access to childcare so our parents can 
return to work. But, folks, this is not 
Monopoly money. This is real money. 
We have a moral obligation to our fu-
ture generations to spend responsibly. 
Iowans and all Americans deserve 
transparency before we add trillions of 
dollars to their tab. 
With that, I will yield to the Senator 
from Oklahoma. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
Senator SCOTT, Senator ERNST, and I 
are not trying to ask for something 
that the American people aren’t al-
ready asking for as well and, quite 
frankly, the Senate and this White 
House haven’t already said that they 
wanted to be able to do: basic trans-
parency, efficient spending. 
It is Wednesday afternoon right now. 
We are about to take up a bill for, we 
think, $1.9 trillion. And I say ‘‘we 
think’’ because none of us has seen the 
text of this bill yet, not one of us on ei-
ther side of the aisle. And the debate 
was supposed to begin on it today, but 
none of us has seen the text for this. 
Supposedly, we are supposed to start 
voting on it tomorrow night, though no 
one has seen the text of the bill yet. In 
addition to that, last year, this Con-
gress, on a bipartisan basis, passed five 
COVID relief bills totaling over $4 tril-
lion. Every dollar of that $4 trillion 
was borrowed, every dollar. None of 
that was budgeted. But there was bi-
partisan 
agreement 
as 
we 
walked 
through the process to determine that 
this is an emergency; this is a global 
pandemic. To help stabilize our econ-
omy from going into free fall, we have 
to do some very difficult things. But in 
the middle of all of that, we also said 
we don’t need to borrow a dollar more 
than what we need to borrow. Let’s 
borrow what we need to but not more 
than we need to. 
Interestingly enough, of the five bills 
and $4 trillion that was allocated for 
COVID last year, only $3 trillion of 
that $4 trillion has actually been spent 
yet. We still have over $1 trillion 
unspent of the money from last year. 
But before that last trillion dollars, 
which imagine just how big that really 
is—to give you an example, every sin-
gle Agency in the Federal Government, 
the total budget for a year, is $1 tril-
lion. So this ‘‘little $1 trillion’’ that is 
left would cover the total budget for 
every Agency in the Federal Govern-
ment for all of next year. 
With this $1 trillion that is still 
unspent, the Biden administration and 
my Democratic colleagues are saying: 
We want an additional $2 trillion. Basi-
cally, near the end of the pandemic, 
they want a bill as large as what we 
had the very first month of the pan-
demic a year ago, when we knew we 
were in economic free fall. 
All we are asking are a couple of 
things: One is, hey, can we read the 
bill? No. 2, can we get real numbers of 
what is unspent and anything that is 
unspent that we can reallocate for 
something in the future? Let me give 
you an example. The best I can tell, we 
have about $6 billion still left in the 
vaccine line item left over from last 
year—$6 billion just for vaccine, and 
that is vaccine purchases. There is an-
other $17 billion left over just for all 
the distribution process for vaccines. 
That is a lot of money. 
Just yesterday, President Biden an-
nounced we will have all the vaccines 
available for every adult in America by 
the end of May. It is paid for, set aside, 
ready to go. Yet this bill that I under-
stand 
is 
coming 
tomorrow—maybe 
later today—has tens of billions of dol-
lars more in vaccine money. Why are 
there tens of billions of dollars more in 
vaccine money, when just yesterday 
the President announced we have all 
the purchases done all the way through 
toward the end of May to vaccinate 
every adult in America? And there are 
billions of dollars still left over in the 
two vaccine accounts even after that. 
Why are we asking for tens of billions 
of dollars more? Where is that money 
going? That shouldn’t be an unreason-
able question. That should be a ques-
tion everybody should ask. Why are we 
asking for tens of billions of dollars 
more in vaccine money when we have 
already purchased everything related 
to vaccines? Is this foreign aid vac-
cines? We don’t know. 
There is $170 billion being requested 
for education expenses. All of us want 
to take care of education, but $170 bil-
lion is twice as much as what the

American people spend on education in 
a year. The total education budget is 
$67 billion for the entire year for all of 
the Federal education budget—$67 bil-
lion. This is now very close to three 
times what the annual budget is for all 
of spending just for COVID. And, by the 
way, still unspent in the education 
amount from last year’s budget, we un-
derstand, is about $68 billion. So there 
is still $68 billion unallocated in edu-
cation entities that hasn’t even been 
touched yet. 
Hey, listen, before everybody jumps 
up and says, you Republicans are just 
being a blockade, can we just ask a 
question? How much money is unspent, 
and what is the money going toward 
that we are asking for? That shouldn’t 
be an unreasonable question. That 
should be a reasonable question. We are 
not trying to be obstructionists; we are 
just trying to get information. 
And, quite frankly, when our team 
calls over to the White House and says: 
Can you give us the details of what is 
unspent in this amount—I know it is 
early in their Presidency, and they are 
still getting organized, but most of the 
time their answer is: We will get back 
to you, and they never do. 
We need to know what is still left 
over of this $1 trillion that has already 
been allocated before we allocate an-
other $2 trillion, knowing every single 
dollar of that is borrowed from China 
or somewhere else. 
This is a real issue. We should resolve 
this before we move to spending an-
other $2 trillion. And I thank very 
much Senator SCOTT for his leadership 
in this area and asking some very basic 
questions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank Senator LANKFORD and 
Senator ERNST. 
Passing this resolution will show the 
American people that Congress can be 
both responsive to the needs of Amer-
ican families and small businesses hurt 
by this pandemic while also remaining 
fully accountable for the proper stew-
ardship of tax dollars. 
This is about basic transparency and 
getting the facts. If this resolution 
passes and the administration shares 
the information I have been requesting, 
it will go a long way in helping Con-
gress craft a targeted bill that directly 
addresses the real needs in our Nation 
today. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 88, submitted earlier today. I 
further ask that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I re-
serve the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
certainly appreciate the Senator from 
Florida’s interest in oversight of the 
coronavirus emergency relief funds. 
This funding has been and continues to 
be critical to the American people 
throughout the pandemic. 
I also appreciate the Senator’s sup-
port for the creation of the Pandemic 
Response Accountability Committee 
when he voted for the CARES Act. This 
was a provision that I authored to en-
sure that we would have strong over-
sight of coronavirus relief dollars. 
I agree wholeheartedly that we must 
be 
faithful 
stewards 
of 
taxpayer 
money. That is why the CARES Act di-
rected the Government Accountability 
Office, our congressional watchdog, to 
oversee coronavirus spending. We are 
fortunate to receive consistent, de-
tailed reporting and recommendations 
on these issues. The Senator’s resolu-
tion, however, will not strengthen 
these oversight mechanisms, nor will it 
deliver any form of relief to families 
who are hurting and small businesses 
that are struggling. 
If the Senator from Florida wants an 
update on the current status of funding 
from previous coronavirus relief bills, I 
am happy to provide one to him. 
Let’s 
first 
look 
at 
the 
first 
coronavirus relief measures, all of 
which were passed in March and April 
of last year. To date, approximately 93 
percent of those funds have been obli-
gated and 88 percent have been outlaid. 
After accounting for benefits that are, 
by design, continuing to be paid out 
over time, there is less than $100 billion 
of uncommitted funds left, and ap-
proximately half of that is in the Pro-
vider Relief Fund for struggling med-
ical providers, whose needs continue to 
be extremely high. 
For the legislation signed into law on 
December 27, 2020, more than half of 
this funding has already been com-
mitted, but if we set aside expanded 
unemployment benefits, which expire 
next month; small business relief; and 
the tax credit portion of the economic 
impact payments, which will be dis-
bursed over time, less than 12 percent 
of the funding from December remains 
unobligated. 
We know the status of funds from 
past COVID relief bills. This informa-
tion is not being kept secret in any 
way. In addition to reports from the 
Pandemic 
Response 
Accountability 
Committee and the Government Ac-
countability Office, we have a monthly 
SF 133 report from the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. 
Coronavirus-related spending is also 
publicly tracked—publicly tracked—on 
both USASpending.gov and on the 
website of the Pandemic Response Ac-
countability Committee. 
We don’t need more reports right 
now; we need action. We have been 
fighting a public health and economic 
crisis, neither of which will magically 
disappear without additional Federal 
action. We can’t wait until more small 
businesses close or hospitals run into 
the red. We know how badly Americans 
are hurting, and they are hurting right 
now. 
We are a full year into this pandemic 
that has taken the lives of over 515,000 
Americans. And this pandemic is not 
over. It is continuing to ravage com-
munities all across our Nation. 
Let’s look at where we are right now. 
Upwards of 2,000 Americans are dying 
each and every day. Daily cases are at 
the same levels we saw during the last 
surge in July, with over 50,000 Ameri-
cans testing positive for COVID–19 
every day. We are also facing the new 
threat of emerging variants like the 
UK and South African strains, which 
unfortunately could lead to even more 
cases. 
The economic toll continues to go on. 
Millions of Americans remain out of 
work. In January, the unemployment 
rate 
was 
nearly 
double 
that 
of 
prepandemic levels, and unemployment 
claims are still more than double 
prepandemic 
levels. 
We 
all 
have 
friends, family members, and neighbors 
who are hurting right now. Small busi-
nesses have had to slash their hours, 
cutting into their own bottom line and 
employees’ paychecks. 
We need to help struggling families 
by providing rental assistance, stim-
ulus checks, and unemployment bene-
fits. We need to help kids by supporting 
our schools so we can get back to in- 
person learning. We need to invest in 
the public health infrastructure nec-
essary to combat this virus by increas-
ing testing capacity, implementing 
vaccine 
education 
campaigns, 
and 
tracking 
and 
containing 
the 
new 
COVID variants that we see springing 
up. 
We are starting to see a glimpse of 
light at the end of this very long—far 
too long—tunnel, but we must keep 
moving forward. The American Rescue 
Plan will finally allow us to control 
the virus, improve the lives of all 
Americans, and get us out of this cri-
sis. 
We should not be wasting time on 
partisan resolutions that will neither 
deliver relief nor meaningfully improve 
oversight of COVID relief efforts. We 
must come together and provide the re-
lief that families and small businesses 
all across our country so desperately 
need. 
Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The junior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I am extremely disappointed in 
my colleague’s decision to block this 
resolution. 
My 
colleagues 
and 
I 
wouldn’t be doing this resolution if we 
were receiving the information that 
my colleague said we were receiving. 
This has nothing to do with whether 
Senate Republicans want to provide re-
lief. We want to provide relief. We want 
to do it in a targeted manner, and we 
want to make sure that we don’t waste 
taxpayer dollars. 
This objection just blocked the Sen-
ate from requesting basic information

that will help us do our basic jobs. Sen-
ate Democrats just objected to trans-
parency. This means they are against 
giving us the facts, against ensuring 
accountability, and against getting 
targeted help to the right people. My 
colleague is choosing to prevent the 
Senate 
from 
receiving 
information 
that is pertinent to our ongoing nego-
tiations. 
Senate Republicans believe in relief 
of those hurt by COVID–19. We want to 
help our small businesses. We want to 
help those who have lost their jobs. We 
want to make sure families are able to 
survive this crisis and come out on the 
other side with their health and liveli-
hood. 
My colleague’s objection shows that 
Senate Democrats are not actually in-
terested in finding a bipartisan solu-
tion to our Nation’s problems. Instead, 
they want to blindly spend money on 
provisions 
completely 
unrelated 
to 
COVID, as if there are no consequences 
to racking up more debt and spending 
beyond our means. 
I am thinking about the kids who are 
just like me, growing up in public 
housing, with parents who are barely 
scraping by. We need to help those fam-
ilies. In order to do that, we need to 
better understand where the need is. 
I am disappointed in my colleague’s 
decision, and I hope he reconsiders. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Utah. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the bill 
before the Senate this week is not real-
ly about COVID relief; it is about poli-
tics. Before this, COVID relief has not 
been a terribly partisan issue. In fact, 
we have passed 5 relief bills, each with 
at least 90 votes. That means they are 
overwhelmingly broad-based and bipar-
tisan efforts. So if this one were to 
pass, it would be the first of those to 
have passed that has been highly con-
troversial. Why? Because, in the first 
place, it borrows and spends another 
$1.9 trillion when there are still hun-
dreds of billions of dollars of unspent 
relief money from past COVID–19 relief 
packages. The new spending authorizes 
money to go to projects in States and 
local governments, including many 
that may not even need it. 
The fight against the pandemic has, 
of course, fundamentally changed in 
the months since this plan was first de-
vised and proposed. It is already out-
dated. Now, as we are here, into the 
month of March, the circumstances 
have changed, yet the plan remains 
largely the same as it was. So it feels 
a little bit, to me, like we are fighting 
the last war using the last war’s battle 
plan, leaving us unprepared for the bat-
tle actually in front of us. 
This is a bill that will worsen our na-
tional debt and weaken our economy in 
the long run without even doing much 
to help small businesses and American 
families in the short term. 
This is not without consequence. In 
fact, as the book by Drs. Reinhart and 
Rogoff, published nearly 10 years ago— 
a book known as ‘‘This Time Is Dif-
ferent’’—notes, once we get into this 
cycle, once we get accustomed to 
spending this much and acquiring this 
much of a debt-to-GDP ratio, we find 
ourselves in dire circumstances—cir-
cumstances in which it is even more 
difficult to raise the same revenue 
based on the same tax structure or 
even while tweaking that tax struc-
ture, it can be very difficult to pull out 
of the tailspin that could be produced 
when we start spending in sums this 
large and perpetuating a debt-to-GDP 
ratio that is, frankly, unsustainable. 
This $1.9 trillion package has very, 
very little to do with COVID–19. In 
fact, only 1 percent of the spending in 
this bill will go toward accelerating 
vaccine distribution; just 5 percent is 
focused on public health. Instead, ac-
cording to the Committee for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget, three times as 
much money will go toward partisan 
priorities that are ‘‘not directly related 
to the current crisis.’’ 
What are some of the examples of 
this type of spending? Well, we have 
$1.5 billion more set aside for Amtrak, 
which is itself already sitting on $1 bil-
lion of unspent bailout money. What 
this has to do with the virus and why 
the virus somehow justifies giving 
them an additional $1.5 billion when 
they are already sitting on $1 billion of 
still unspent bailout money is beyond 
my comprehension. There is $50 million 
in funding for environmental justice 
projects, also difficult to connect that 
up to COVID; $200 million for the Insti-
tute of Museum and Library Services; 
$135 million for the National Endow-
ment for the Arts; $135 million for the 
National Endowment for the Human-
ities; $86 billion in a pension bailout for 
private sector workers. 
The list goes on and on, but you get 
the idea. You get money that goes to 
projects, as well as a significant 
amount to State and local govern-
ments. We will get back to that in a 
moment. When there is as much as $63 
billion leftover in unspent funds, this 
money will not necessarily even help 
schools to reopen. 
And $350 billion in aid goes to State 
and local governments, even though 
total losses to date have mostly been 
covered by the $360 billion that Con-
gress has already provided in aid for 
State and local governments over the 
last year. While there is some disparity 
among and between the States and how 
they have responded to the COVID pan-
demic and how they fared as far as 
their revenues, State and local revenue 
has mostly recovered, and while 26 
States saw general revenue decline, 21 
States actually saw revenue gains. In 
fact, my home State of Utah, as well as 
some other States, is running sur-
pluses. Utah’s sacrifice and good gov-
ernance should not go to bail out other 
profligate States to the tune of $350 bil-
lion. 
I think about hard-working moms 
and dads in Utah, struggling to make 
ends meet while paying their Federal 
and State taxes. They are told over and 
over and over again that they have to 
be giving more. They are told that 
what they have spent and the time 
they have allotted—weeks or months 
out of every year just to pay their Fed-
eral tax alone—still somehow isn’t 
enough, isn’t nearly enough because, in 
addition to the money that they have 
worked so hard to earn and give to the 
Federal Government, there is so much 
more that has to be spent, like $1.5 bil-
lion going to Amtrak, even though it is 
already sitting on $1 billion of unspent 
bailout relief. 
These same moms and dads through-
out Utah are not pleased when they are 
made to understand that, in addition 
to bailing out Amtrak again when Am-
trak is already sitting on this $1 billion 
in unspent bailout relief money, they 
are also going to have to bail out other 
States; they are going to have to bail 
out State and local governments that 
haven’t been managed well, as Utah’s 
government has. This isn’t fair to 
them. This is a matter of fundamental 
fairness to them and to countless 
Americans, not only in Utah but in 
every State. 
Some States still have unspent fund-
ing that they have gotten from pre-
vious COVID relief packages. Cali-
fornia alone has $8 billion in unspent 
funding, and New York has up to $5 bil-
lion. In this bill, we are acting like 
States are facing a fiscal catastrophe 
that is specifically from COVID when 
they are not. 
At the same time, we are acting like 
the unprecedented magnitude of Fed-
eral debt is a nonissue. It is not. We 
have got this situation exactly back-
ward. 
Look, any new relief funding just 
needs to be targeted, and it needs to be 
temporary, and it needs to be directly 
tied to COVID relief. This package is, 
instead, about fulfilling the political 
wish list of one political party over an-
other and has very little, if anything, 
to do with the pandemic. It is offen-
sive, and, yes, it is inappropriate for 
one political party—the political party 
that clings to the narrowest of margins 
of a majority in this body—to push its 
own political wish list onto an oppor-
tunity to provide COVID relief for the 
American people, and it would be 
equally inappropriate for Republicans 
to use it as an opportunity to push 
their own wish list. 
Look, we haven’t seen this before. We 
haven’t seen anything like this before. 
We didn’t, in the past, see any of the 
previous COVID relief packages pushed 
through reconciliation. There are a 
number of reasons for that, one of 
which was it is wrong. It is not an ap-
propriate use of reconciliation. An-
other was, it wasn’t necessary because 
we made it bipartisan, not just mildly 
bipartisan with a few straggler votes

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1016 
March 3, 2021 
This one is different. I am not op-
posed to discussing what role govern-
ment should play in providing actual 
relief from the pandemic. We can and 
should have that debate. I welcome it. 
I would love to have it right now. In 
fact, that is a question that I think 
merits its own debate. This bill is not 
about that, not anything close to that. 
It is riddled with poor economic rea-
soning and rank political favoritism. It 
will only worsen our debt and our eco-
nomic health in the long run. It doesn’t 
help America’s small businesses and 
families in the short run. It doesn’t do 
anything to materially advance the 
cause of getting our children back to 
school at a time when they have suf-
fered so greatly, not only academically 
but socially and in so many other 
ways. That is where we ought to be fo-
cused. 
This bill comes nowhere close to ad-
dressing that issue, and, instead, it di-
rects itself in other directions that are 
not only helpful, but in many cases 
they are the opposite of that. 
It is sad. It is disappointing. And on 
that basis, I can’t support this bill but 
would urge my colleagues to figure out 
ways to make it better. We don’t have 
to do it this way. It doesn’t have to be 
a deeply partisan vote. We can still 
choose a different path. I, for one, hope 
we will. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, the 
circumstances that we face today in 
the Senate are so disturbing. This is 
really, really unbelievable. I mean, 
there is so much good news out there 
on the healthcare front, on the pan-
demic front, on the economic front. 
But what we are going to do in this 
Chamber is absolutely, absolutely ap-
palling. 
The Members of this Chamber came 
together five times last year and 
passed overwhelmingly bipartisan bills 
to deal with this pandemic, to deal 
with the economic crisis that came 
from the lockdown that we experi-
enced—five times, about $4 trillion, 
completely unprecedented in scope and 
scale, the nature of it. Never imagined 
before, but we did it. We did it because 
we needed to, and we came together. I 
think it was the biggest of the bills 
passed—the biggest by far—without a 
single ‘‘no’’ vote in this whole Cham-
ber, completely bipartisan. 
So President Biden gets elected, 
gives a great speech, a great inaugural 
speech, about uniting the country, 
coming together: We don’t have to be 
divided the way we have been. We can 
work 
together 
and 
find 
common 
ground. 
So 10 Republican Senators go down 
to the White House and say: Well, Mr. 
President, I know you would like to do 
$1.9 trillion, whatever it is, but we 
think there is a good case for $600 bil-
lion. 
Now, I don’t happen to agree with 
those 10 Republican Senators, as it 
happens. I don’t think even that is ap-
propriate, but they did. And the reason 
that is significant is that there were 10 
of them, which just so happens to be 
exactly the minimum number needed 
of Republican Senators to join with the 
Democrats to pass anything they want 
on a bipartisan basis. So there, handed 
to him on a silver platter, to the Presi-
dent, was the opportunity to do a bi-
partisan bill to figure out where that 
common ground was. The Republicans 
were offering to negotiate from there. 
This probably could have ended easily 
at $1 trillion or so after just weeks be-
fore passing a $1 trillion bill. The 
President could have gotten so much of 
what he wanted, but President Biden 
didn’t want any part of that. You have 
to ask yourself, why is that when he 
campaigned as the guy who is going to 
unify America, and he had every Re-
publican vote he needed sitting in his 
office, asking him to work this out? He 
said: No, not interested. Effectively, 
that is what he said. 
Well, when you look at the bill, it is 
clear why President Biden chose this 
path, because there is no justification 
for this bill. There is no medical jus-
tification. There is no pandemic jus-
tification. There is no economic jus-
tification. This isn’t about coming to-
gether and doing something about a 
crisis; this is about a partisan leftwing 
wish list. And, of course, Republicans 
aren’t interested in that kind of polit-
ical gesturing that is going to do eco-
nomic damage. 
I am reminded of the words of Rahm 
Emanuel, who famously said: ‘‘You 
never want a serious crisis to go to 
waste.’’ Rahm Emanuel must be very 
proud of our Democratic colleagues and 
President Biden because what they 
have done is they have taken a crisis 
that is rapidly receding—let’s be hon-
est—and they decided this is their 
chance to make one last mad dash to 
the door with a staggering amount of 
money and presumably claim credit for 
the recovery that is already well un-
derway. 
The good news is—there is a lot of 
good news, right? We went through one 
of the most trying times we have been 
through in a very long time in this 
country. 
This 
pandemic 
was 
dev-
astating. It was deadly, it was scary, 
and the economic crisis was very, very 
real. But now we have over 100 million 
doses of vaccines that have gone into 
people’s arms. You figure that we 
might very well have 100 million Amer-
icans who have had the disease and re-
covered. We have to have well over half 
of the American population who has ei-
ther recovered or been vaccinated and 
is therefore no longer at risk to this 
disease—not a significant risk. That is 
fantastic news. 
By the way, the vaccine administra-
tion is accelerating. Following that, we 
are unsurprisingly seeing this terrific 
collapse in the number of new cases. 
The daily count of new cases of the 
coronavirus, of COVID–19, peaked at 
around 250,000 new cases in a single 
day. We were running at that pace. By 
the time we got to the inauguration of 
President Biden, we were down to 
185,000, and yesterday was about 60,000. 
So we are less than a quarter of the 
number of new cases on a daily basis 
that we were experiencing at the peak, 
and it continues to drop. It is going to 
continue to decline probably very rap-
idly as we continue to roll out these 
vaccines. That is terrific. 
There is a sort of parallel recovery of 
the economy underway. If you go back 
to April of 2020, when it was at its 
worst, the unemployment rate was al-
most 15 percent, 14.8 percent. That is a 
terrible, terrible unemployment rate. 
As of January of this year, just a few 
months ago, the unemployment rate 
was 6.3 percent, less than half of where 
we were. We are not back to the fan-
tastic economy we had a year ago just 
before this pandemic broke, but we are 
getting there. Eighteen States across 
the country have unemployment rates 
below 5 percent, so we are going to get 
there. 
The economy is growing. After a col-
lapse in the second quarter of last year, 
the third quarter came roaring back, 
and the fourth quarter grew. The Con-
gressional Budget Office thinks that in 
this whole calendar year of 2021, our 
economy will grow almost 5 percent. 
Most private economists think it will 
be more than that. There is a lively de-
bate about whether we will even reach 
6 or 7 or more percent growth. We were 
told never again to expect to see 3 per-
cent. But that is how strong this eco-
nomic recovery is because of the resil-
iency of the American people, the tre-
mendous ingenuity of the private sec-
tor to come up with vaccines that are 
incredibly effective—several of them— 
and do it in a record time, I mean a 
fraction of what was the previous 
record time. It is amazing. 
And yes, you know what, we played a 
role in this too. I think we did. The bi-
partisan cooperation of Congress to 
pass one bill after another on a huge 
scale—like I said, five bills. The big-
gest was without a single dissenting— 
actually, I am not sure any of them 
had a dissenting vote in the Senate. 
And there was almost a trillion dollars 
in December, leaving tens of billions of 
dollars that we approved that haven’t 
even been spent yet. The intended 
beneficiaries haven’t gotten the money 
yet. It takes a little while to get the 
money out the door. 
Given this context, given this his-
tory, this is why it is so dispiriting to 
see our Democratic colleagues insist-
ing on a bill that has almost nothing to 
do with COVID. That is the truth. It is 
not about reopening the economy; it is 
a partisan leftwing spending binge. 
That is what it is. Let’s take a look at 
some of the individual items. 
We have these so-called stimulus 
checks—I never heard anything more 
inaptly named—$414 billion. The fact 
is, real, personal income in the country

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1017 
March 3, 2021 
today is higher than it was just before 
the pandemic. Disposable, real, per 
capita income rose at its highest rate 
since 1984. Personal savings rate hit an 
alltime record high in 2020. Why? Be-
cause we more than replaced lost in-
come through all of the bills that we 
passed. What about that data suggests 
we need another round of universal 
payments to people? It is not going to 
stimulate the economy. Even the last 
check—60 percent of that money went 
to savings accounts or paying down 
debt. According to a Penn Wharton 
study, about 75 percent of these checks 
are going to go into savings. 
Why in the world are we sending so 
many checks to tens of millions of peo-
ple who never had any lost income? 
Under this bill, the Federal Govern-
ment is going to send out $5,600 to a 
family of four—$5,600 to a family of 
four who makes $160,000 a year and 
never had a dime of income loss, no 
interruption of income, no loss of in-
come. They are going to get $5,600. By 
the way, that is on top of the $5,800 
they already got last year, with no 
need, no demonstrated problem here. 
So $11,400 of money that we don’t have, 
we are going to send to people who 
never had a dime of lost income. That 
is a big chunk of this bill. 
It may not be the worst. It may be 
that the worst is the $350 billion we are 
going to send to State and local gov-
ernments to bail out the mismanaged 
blue States and cities. The amazing 
thing is, you can’t possibly make the 
case that they need the bailout. They 
don’t even need it. Why do I say that? 
Well, if you look in 2020—the books are 
closed now. We know what we didn’t 
know early in the year of 2020. We are 
in 2021 now. We know what happened in 
2020. 
What happened was States and mu-
nicipalities in the aggregate brought in 
more revenue in 2020 than they did in 
2019, which was a record year. So they 
set an alltime new record for tax rev-
enue collected—alltime new record. 
And that does not include the $500 bil-
lion we sent them anyway. I mean, 
these States are loaded with cash. I 
don’t know what they are going to do 
with it. 
There is $60 billion in rainy day 
funds. We heard: Oh my goodness, these 
States are going to have to cut essen-
tial services. All the teachers are going 
to be laid off. The firemen and the po-
lice officers are all done. 
How is that when they have taken in 
more revenue than they ever have be-
fore in their history and then we sent 
them another $500 billion? Now we are 
going to send them yet another $350 on 
top of this? How does this make any 
sense at all? We are going to borrow or 
print this money so we can send it to a 
bunch of States, many of which are sit-
ting on so much cash, they are going to 
probably cut taxes. It is just unbeliev-
able. 
Then there is the ObamaCare expan-
sion. What does that have to do with 
COVID? This is just a decade-long goal 
of our Democratic colleagues to con-
tinue 
the 
endless 
expansion 
of 
ObamaCare. There is $45 billion in this 
bill to pay insurance companies more 
money to cover people who already 
have health insurance. That is what 
they are doing. Sixty-three percent of 
these new subsidies will go to people 
who already have health insurance 
through ObamaCare. By the way, it in-
cludes huge numbers of people who 
make over $100,000 a year. Never miss a 
chance to make more people dependent 
on government. 
It has policies, big policies, that will 
absolutely slow the economic recovery. 
Let me be clear. This bill will slow 
down the economic recovery underway. 
Why do I say that? Well, the bill insists 
on adding $400 a week on top of what-
ever States are paying in unemploy-
ment benefits. Well, what does that 
mean? It means that more than half of 
everyone who is unemployed is going 
to get paid more not to work than they 
get paid working. Who could even 
think this up? 
We have had unemployment insur-
ance for decades in this country. We 
have never said: Let’s systematically 
make sure that people can make more 
money not working than they can 
make if they go to work. 
I hear some of my colleagues talk 
about the dignity of work. I think 
there is a lot of dignity in work. What 
is our message to people about the dig-
nity of work when we say: You are 
worth more to us sitting on the couch 
than you are at your job. That is what 
this is. It is a terrible idea. 
How do you know for sure that no-
body on the other side is even pre-
tending that this is really about the 
economic recovery? Well, you know for 
sure because the Congressional Budget 
Office has told us that only a fraction— 
a small fraction—of this money is even 
going to be spent this year. How long 
do we think the pandemic is going to 
be with us as a pandemic? How long do 
we think we are going to have these 
lockdowns? We are going to be out of 
the woods pretty soon here. 
As I said, half of all Americans have 
already been either vaccinated or re-
covered from this. But the school num-
bers are a good illustration, the ele-
mentary and secondary education. This 
bill has $128 billion—$128 billion—and 
$6.5 billion is going to be spent in 2021. 
The rest gets dribbled out for years and 
years. How long do they think before 
schools can reopen? Oh, by the way, 
this bill doesn’t require schools to re-
open. You don’t even have to reopen. 
Just throw billions and billions of dol-
lars at schools whether or not they are 
actually having kids in the school. 
Some of these provisions are so bla-
tantly unrelated to COVID or the econ-
omy that it is really just hard to even 
read them with a straight face. 
There is $86 billion to bail out multi-
employer pension plans without any re-
form whatsoever. Look, we all know we 
have a multiemployer pension problem 
in this country, and there has been a 
lot of discussion about what do you do 
about these grossly underfunded pen-
sion plans and how do you fix this. The 
conversation has always been, what 
kinds of reforms come with what kind 
of cash so that these errors of the past 
are corrected? There are no reforms 
here. None. Nothing. Just a big pile of 
cash. It is a clear message that you 
don’t have to fix anything. You don’t 
have to reform the flaws of these pro-
grams that got us here. And by the 
way, it is the same message to the in-
solvent public pension plans of most of 
the major cities in many States: Don’t 
worry. Look what Congress will do if 
the Democrats have their way. They 
will just send you so much cash, you 
don’t have to worry about the insol-
vency you are dealing with. 
What a terrible message. 
There is $270 million for the National 
Endowment for the Arts and Human-
ities. That is COVID-related. Thank 
goodness that is there. 
There is $91 million for ‘‘outreach’’ to 
student loan borrowers. I don’t even 
know what that means. 
There is $50 million for environ-
mental justice grants. I have no idea 
what that means. 
But this one is really rich. There is 
about $4 billion for ‘‘socially disadvan-
taged farmers and ranchers.’’ I say 
‘‘about $4 billion’’ because it says 
‘‘such sums as may be necessary.’’ Here 
is what the money is for. It is going to 
pay off 120 percent of the debt of these 
farmers and ranchers, 120 percent of 
the borrowings. 
So what in the world are the require-
ments to have 120 percent of your debt 
paid off? Well, you actually have to 
have debt. OK, so you have to have bor-
rowed money from the USDA farm 
loan. There are tens of billions of dol-
lars out there. They lend a lot of 
money. And you have to be a member 
of one of the following groups: African 
American, American Indian, Alaskan 
Native, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Island-
ers, refugees, or immigrants. 
As long as you are in one of those 
categories of mostly racial and ethnic 
groups, then the taxpayers are going to 
pay off 120 percent. It is not the whole 
loan but more than the whole loan—120 
percent. 
The thing that is so disturbing about 
this is that the essential criterion is 
your skin color. The essential criterion 
is your race. This is unbelievable to 
me. By the way, there is no income 
test and no asset test for the under-
lying loans. There is no requirement 
whatsoever that COVID caused any 
problem—caused any lost income or 
any other problem. It is not mentioned. 
So what is the effect of this? 
This means that, if you have a 
wealthy Hispanic rancher who has a $1 
million loan from the USDA, he is 
going to get $1.2 million and pay off the 
loan—200,000 bucks with which to do 
whatever he likes. Meanwhile, if you 
are a poor White farmer in rural Penn-
sylvania and you have a $100,000 loan, 
you get nothing, exactly nothing. How

S1018 
March 3, 2021 
is that even remotely fair? I don’t even 
know how that could be constitutional. 
It is, certainly, not in any way COVID 
related. 
There was an amendment in the 
House that would have limited the pay-
ment. It would have allowed the pro-
gram, which I object to, but it would 
have allowed this repayment of debt 
but only for debt incurred during the 
COVID crisis. The Democrats all voted 
that down. That failed. This is unbe-
lievable stuff. 
Even the provisions that purport to 
be about public health are completely 
divorced from any reality. As I think I 
mentioned 
earlier, 
we 
are 
admin-
istering almost 2 million doses of vac-
cines every day now. That is terrific. It 
is actually the highest daily rate of 
doses administered anywhere in the 
world. The government has already 
purchased 700 million doses. Now, we 
have fewer than 350 million Americans, 
and not all Americans are going to 
need two doses. You can do the math: 
We have bought more vaccine doses 
than we need to administer, and that is 
fine. Yet how many more do you need 
to buy when you have already bought 
more than enough for every single 
American? 
That is not all we paid for. Through 
the previous bills that we passed, we 
paid for the research and development. 
We paid for the production. We paid for 
the transportation. We paid for all of 
the accompanying supplies, like the sy-
ringes, the vials, and the dry ice. We 
paid for all of that, and we should have. 
That was the right thing to do. Insur-
ance covers the cost of the admin-
istering of the vaccines. Between Medi-
care and Medicaid and private insur-
ance, it is free. What is left to spend 
money on? I am all ears, but I haven’t 
heard what we need to spend money on. 
So what do we have in this bill? 
We have no justification for it in 
terms of public health. We certainly 
have no justification for it in terms of 
the economy. We certainly have no jus-
tification for it in terms of basic fair-
ness. Frankly, it is going to do more 
harm than good, but you don’t have to 
take my word for it. We could take the 
word of prominent liberal Democrat 
economist Larry Summers. He was the 
Treasury Secretary under President 
Clinton, and he was the Director of the 
National 
Economic 
Council 
under 
President Obama. 
He said about this bill: 
[M]acroeconomic stimulus on a scale clos-
er to World War II levels than normal reces-
sion levels will set off inflationary pressures 
of a kind we have not seen in a generation. 
Or consider the words of Steve 
Rattner, who is a liberal economist. 
President Obama named him the ‘‘car 
czar.’’ You may recall him admin-
istering that program. 
He said of the American Rescue Plan, 
which is, apparently, what they call 
this: 
The American Rescue Plan is also partly a 
legislative Trojan horse—an enormous aid 
package aimed at addressing needs that, in 
some cases, go well beyond the immediate 
challenges of COVID. Some of the most ex-
pensive provisions are the least well targeted 
to help the neediest. 
That is from a liberal Democrat who, 
I think, supports the bill, but at least 
he is being honest in his description of 
it. 
So my suggestion, my plea, to my 
Democratic colleagues and to the new 
President is to listen to some of the 
things you have said. Try an approach 
that is actually informed by the facts 
on the ground—the health facts, the 
economic facts, the reality. Look at 
what the science is currently telling us 
about the course that this virus has 
been taking. What about actually at-
tempting to bring people together—the 
path of unity—after we demonstrated 
five times last year that we can work 
together and do something on a bipar-
tisan basis? 
I urge my colleagues: Don’t push 
through this radically partisan bill 
that will probably, in the end, do more 
harm than good. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, let 
me first say that I wish this Chamber 
were full of our colleagues who had lis-
tened to my Republican colleague’s de-
scription—the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania—of what this bill is and what 
this bill isn’t. It is not a COVID relief 
bill. Senator TOOMEY did an excellent 
job. I am hoping that people are watch-
ing it on their TV screens. They really 
can’t be reading the bill yet because it 
is not constructed. I don’t want to re-
peat all of the excellent points the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania made, but I 
wanted to come down because I think 
we have grown immune to these vast 
amounts of money. 
I always knew we were going to be in 
big trouble when we stopped talking 
about hundreds of billions of dollars 
and switched to talking about trillions 
of dollars. When we talk about $1 tril-
lion or $2 trillion, it just doesn’t sound 
like as much as $200 billion or $800 bil-
lion, which was in the stimulus pack-
age under the Obama administration. 
The fact of the matter is we have al-
ready authorized $4 trillion in COVID 
relief. That is 18 percent of last year’s 
GDP, and, roughly, $1 trillion is yet to 
be spent. Some of that isn’t even obli-
gated, and we are going to be debating, 
over the next couple of days, $1.9 tril-
lion. So I just wanted to come down 
here to the floor and try to illustrate 
what a massive amount of money $1.9 
trillion is. You have to use analogies. 
Again, the human mind really can’t 
contemplate what ‘‘a trillion’’ is. 
I found this first analogy—my wife 
talked to me about it—in terms of 
time. This one is simply talking about, 
if I would give the Presiding Officer $1 
per second, how long would it take me 
to give her $1 million? You see the 
chart here. It would take 11.6 days. 
Again, with $1 per second, how long 
would it take to give her $1 million? 
11.6 days. 
The next question: How long would it 
take you to accumulate $1 billion? 
Again, when you do the math, you 
find out it would take 31.7 years. That 
was back when the Chinese had their 
protests in Tiananmen Square. 
The next question: What about $1 
trillion? 
This is what becomes mind-boggling. 
If I gave you $1 every second and I 
wanted to give you $1 trillion, it would 
take 31,688 years to give you $1 trillion. 
That takes us back to beyond the last 
glaciation period, a period in time 
when Wisconsin was under a mile-thick 
glacier. 
By the way, as a quick aside for my 
colleague, the Senator from Rhode Is-
land, since that point in time, about 
20,000 years ago, the water level in the 
San Francisco Bay has increased 390 
feet. Now, that is global warming—that 
is a rise in sea level—but that is what 
happened through natural causes. That 
was an aside. 
How long would it take to accumu-
late $1.9 trillion? Over 60,000 years. 
Again, put that in context. The human 
race began to develop language about 
50,000 years ago. So that is the time 
analogy. 
Another way of looking at this is 
through distance and volume. So here 
is 
the 
calculation. 
I 
should 
have 
brought a $1 bill to just demonstrate 
its thickness, but the thickness of a $1 
bill is 4.3-thousandths-of-an-inch thick. 
To illustrate how much $1 trillion is, 
let’s start with $1 million. If you 
stacked a million dollar bills on top of 
each other, they would stack up to be 
358 feet high. You can see the calcula-
tion here. That is about a 30- to 35-foot- 
story building. 
How big would a stack of a billion 
dollar bills be? It would be 67.86 miles. 
Now, there is something called the 
Karman line. I think I am pronouncing 
that right. That is the point at which 
the atmosphere ends and outer space 
begins. That is 62 miles. So a stack of 
a billion dollar bills would actually ex-
ceed the atmosphere and extend into 
outer space—62 miles. 
Then, the next question is: How big 
would a stack be of a trillion dollar 
bills? Well, it would be 1,000 times that. 
So it would be 67,866 miles high. That 
is an astonishingly large stack of dol-
lar bills that equals $1 trillion. 
Again, we are not just talking about 
$1 trillion. We are not talking just 
about 67,000 miles worth. We are talk-
ing about $1.9 trillion, which would 
stack up to be 135,732 miles high. The 
distance to the Moon is 238,900 miles. 
So that stack of $1.9 trillion worth of $1 
bills would be more than halfway to 
the Moon. That is what we are debat-
ing spending—a stack of dollar bills 
that extends more than halfway the 
distance to the Moon. This is at a point 
in time when we are about $28 trillion 
in debt. That single stack would be

over 1.9 million miles or, if you were to 
put it relative to the Moon, there 
would be eight stacks—seven stacks 
that go directly to the Moon and one 
further stack that would be 95 percent 
of the way there. 
These are astonishing sums that we 
are talking about, and the majority 
party here wants to jam this through 
using the reconciliation process—no 
consultation with our side. They want 
to just blow it through here with 20 
hours of debate, a vote-arama, pass $1.9 
trillion in spending, and go home, hav-
ing no consideration whatsoever about 
the fact that we are mortgaging our 
children’s futures. At some point in 
time, there will be a day of reckoning— 
a debt crisis—and it won’t be pretty. 
My suggestion, at least as we con-
sider this, is to actually have a debate. 
Let’s have a discussion. Let’s consider 
the amendments. Let’s not do this in 
20, 24, 30 hours. Let’s take the time to 
seriously consider what we are doing to 
our children in contemplating spending 
a stack of dollar bills over 135 miles 
high, extending more than halfway to 
the Moon. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

SAN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

f 
MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION 
SYSTEM 
Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Madam 
President. This week, we have an op-
portunity to finally deliver for millions 
of retirees and workers and small busi-
nesses by saving America’s pensions. 
The multiemployer pension system is 
on the verge of collapse, threatening 
the livelihoods of more than a million 
Americans and thousands of small 
businesses from New Hampshire to 
Ohio, across the country. This affects 
more than 100,000 workers and retirees 
in my State alone and millions more 
around the country. These pension 
plans were in danger before. Now the 
economic emergency we are in has ac-
celerated the crisis even further. 
Multiemployer pension plans receive 
contributions 
based 
on 
the 
hours 
worked. As workers have been laid off 
during the pandemic, their employers 
no longer contribute to the pension 
plans, while current retirees continue 
receiving their earned benefits, making 
the plan even more likely to fail. And 
if that happens, it won’t just be retir-
ees feeling the pain. 
Current workers will be stuck paying 
into pension funds for benefits they 
will never receive. Small businesses 
will be left drowning in pension liabil-
ity they can’t afford to pay. Small 
businesses that have been in the family 
for generations could face bankruptcy, 
and workers will lose jobs in businesses 
which have been forced to close up 
shop. The effect will ripple across the 
entire economy at a time when we can 
least afford it. 
The Chamber of Commerce has said: 
The multiemployer pension system is an 
integral part of [our] economy. 
It is not only union businesses that 
participate in these plans that will 
close their doors. This will devastate 
small communities across the indus-
trial heartland. Small businesses in 
these communities are already hurting 
because of the virus. That is why we 
have to get this done. 
After a lifetime of hard work and 
service to our country, these workers 
and retirees have already waited far 
too long for Congress to do the job we 
should have done. We have been trying 
to solve this for years. Unions, the 
Chamber of Commerce, small busi-
nesses pretty much agree we need to 
get this done. 
The House has done its part. They 
have passed a solution multiple times. 
Every time it stopped because of MITCH 
MCCONNELL and the U.S. Senate. He 
has deliberately blocked it. We have 
continued to try. The House does it 
year after year. People like the Pre-
siding Officer and others have fought 
for this in the Finance Committee, 
have fought for this on the Senate 
floor, and we simply haven’t been able 
to move it. 
Now that Senator MCCONNELL is out 
of the way, we can finally keep the 
promise to these workers and their 
families. They spent years working on 
assembly lines, bagging groceries, driv-
ing trucks, working to keep our econ-
omy going, and money came out of 
every single one of their paychecks to 
earn these pensions. 
People in this town don’t always un-
derstand 
the 
collective 
bargaining 
process. People give up dollars at the 
bargaining table today for the promise 
of a secure retirement with healthcare 
and a pension. That is what collective 
bargaining is. Union workers sit down 
with each other and their employer, 
talk about giving up wages. They are 
willing to give up wages today to have 
a more secure future. What is more 
American than that? 
For years now, they have lived in 
fear of drastic cuts. One retiree from 
Michigan told us he would lose two- 
thirds of his income and that ‘‘at 71 
years old, there’s no jobs out there that 
we could get to recover what we’d 
lose.’’ 
He said: 
Pass the Butch Lewis Act so . . . we can 
take this weight off of us, and retire with the 
dignity that we earned for 30, 40, 50 years of 
hard working labor. 
It is always the same story. When 
Wall Street is in trouble, there is a 
bailout. When corporations need some-
thing, the stock market is in trouble, 
the Washington elite drop everything 
to help. But these workers, they are 
not asking for a bailout; they are not 
asking for a handout; they are just 
asking for what they earned. 
These workers have been in the fight 
for years. Their activism has gotten us 
this far. They have traveled all day and 
all night on buses. They have rallied 
outside in the bitter cold, in the hot 
DC summer, all trying to get people in 
this town to listen. 
Let’s finally deliver for them. Let’s 
give them peace of mind. Let’s keep 
this promise. It comes back to the dig-
nity of work. When work has dignity, 
we honor the retirement security peo-
ple earned. When work has dignity, we 
honor their retirement security that 
they gave up at the bargaining table in 
collective bargaining. 
I urge my Republican colleagues in 
this body—colleagues with healthcare 
and retirement plans paid for by tax-
payers, including these taxpayers that 
have been paying into their own pen-
sion funds for years. I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues to think about these 
retired workers and think about the 
small business owners. Companies like 
Smucker’s—there 
is 
a 
baker 
in 
Navarre, OH. Think of the candy com-
pany, Spangler, in Bryan, OH—compa-
nies like that. Think about these re-
tired workers. Think about these small 
business owners and think about the 
stress they are facing. 
I have listened to my colleagues’ 
speeches for years, extolling the values 
of hard work and the virtue of small 
businesses. This is your chance to live 
up to your own words, to show Ameri-
cans if you work hard all your life, 
your government will, in fact, be there 
for you. 
Join us, and let’s pass a solution that 
really indeed does honor the dignity of 
work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. ELLEN HODGES 
AND ELIZABETH BATES 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is that time of the week that our 
pages—when we had them—used to al-
ways look forward to. It is the time of 
the week that I come down on the floor 
and talk about someone in Alaska who 
is making a huge impact on my State, 
a lot of times for the country. These 
two Alaskans I am going to talk about 
actually have gotten national news for 
the great work they are doing, some-
body we call our Alaskan of the Week. 
It is usually about a group of individ-
uals, one, two, maybe a group of people 
who are helping make Alaska what, in 
my view, is the greatest State in the 
country—resilient, 
tough, 
generous, 
kind, unique. 
Like so many States, this pandemic 
has really hit Alaska hard—tourism for 
sure. The oil and gas sector last year 
was really hit hard with low prices. Un-
fortunately, this year, with the Biden

administration’s attacks on this sector 
of the United States and Alaska’s econ-
omy, it is tough; commercial fishing, 
tough. It has been a tough year eco-
nomically. But an area of good news 
during the pandemic, one that I am 
very proud of for all of my constitu-
ents, involves how we in Alaska have 
responded on the health side. Vaccines, 
testing, death rates—we have consist-
ently been the top State rated in all of 
these categories throughout the pan-
demic, which is kind of amazing given 
that we are a very, very big State with 
a very small population. 
I know that so many Americans 
watching right now want to get back 
out, visit Alaska. Our Governor, Mike 
Dunleavy, recently tweeted: 
With the best vaccination efforts [in the 
country] & some of the lowest COVID num-
bers in the country, Alaska is open for busi-
ness . . . safe for travelers! 
So come on, America, get back up to 
Alaska. Love to have you. 
So this is all very true. Our vaccina-
tion efforts are viewed as the best in 
the United States of America, and the 
great lengths that so many in Alaska 
have gone through to make it so have 
captured the country’s imagination. 
These efforts just in the last couple of 
weeks have been featured all across the 
country—USA TODAY, ‘‘Good Morning 
America,’’ the Washington Post, the 
New York Times, a great piece by 
Bloomberg News, and so many others. 
So big thanks to the press corps, the 
national press corps, for featuring my 
State’s efforts and importantly the he-
roic work being done to distribute life-
saving vaccines to a State that is more 
than 21⁄2 times the size of Texas. Sorry 
there, Senator CORNYN, Senator CRUZ. 
It is true. 
Most of the geography of Alaska is 
dotted with small villages without 
roads in freezing-cold temperatures. I 
was in Fairbanks last weekend—just a 
couple of weeks ago in Fairbanks. It al-
most hit 40 below. That is cold. 
All across Alaska, our healthcare 
workers are jumping on boats, single- 
prop airplanes, snow machines, and, 
yes, in a couple of cases, dog sleds to 
bring the vaccine and hope to their fel-
low Alaskans. And it shows. 
As of a few days ago, close to 160,000 
Alaskans had received at least their 
first vaccine dose. That is about 21 per-
cent of our State’s population. 
Now, in Southwest Alaska, what we 
called the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, or 
the YK Delta—those are two giant riv-
ers that come together—these efforts 
have 
been 
particularly 
impressive. 
That is largely thanks to the amazing 
people at the YK Health Corporation, 
or YKHC, which is the YK Delta’s Trib-
al health provider. The whole organiza-
tion, 
consisting 
of 
just 
about 
90 
healthcare professionals, serves around 
28,000 people in the YK region, which is 
about the size of Oregon, so a huge 
area, not a lot of people. 
Prior to the vaccine, the YK Delta 
had been stricken by COVID–19 with 
one of the highest infection rates in 
the country, in a very far-flung place 
in terms of the dispersal of the popu-
lation. It is the efforts of two women 
there in the YK Delta, Drs. Ellen 
Hodges and Elizabeth Bates, who are 
our Alaskans of the Week, who have 
been in charge of getting the vaccine to 
roughly 50 remote villages in South-
western Alaska. Spread out over a ter-
ritory, as I said, about the size of Or-
egon, the village populations in the YK 
Delta range from about 1,200 people to 
as small as 10 in terms of population. 
Let’s start with Dr. Hodges. She is 
the chief of staff at YKHC. She grew up 
in rural Minnesota. After graduating 
from the University of Minnesota Med-
ical School, Dr. Hodges came to An-
chorage as a resident in 2002, eventu-
ally making her way to Bethel, which 
is the hub village. It is a big commu-
nity, the biggest in the YK Delta. She 
absolutely fell in love with the area. 
She 
said 
it 
has 
everything—very 
friendly people, authentic. It is beau-
tiful. Soon enough, her patients turned 
into her family. Also soon enough, she 
was—according 
to 
Tricia 
Franklin, 
Alaska’s director of the State Office of 
Rural Health Division—‘‘the go-to per-
son for how things are working in rural 
communities’’ and how to get things 
done. 
She worked in the emergency room 
tending cuts, bruises, broken bones. 
She delivered babies. She worked tire-
lessly to contain a number of tuber-
culosis outbreaks in the region. And 
then the virus hit, and as I mentioned, 
it hit the YK Delta region very hard 
with some of the highest COVID rates 
in America. 
There are reasons for that: the 
multigenerational housing, very crowd-
ed housing in this region; communal 
lifestyle; and also—here is a big one, 
and it should be a shock for every 
American listening—about 50 percent 
of the households in this region of 
America lack running water. Let me 
say that again. Some of the most patri-
otic communities in the country, as 
Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in 
the military than any other ethnic 
group in the country, live in commu-
nities that don’t have running water or 
flushed toilets—American citizens. 
It is wrong. It is wrong. And we 
need—we the U.S. Senate, Congress—to 
continue to work on this issue. How do 
you wash your hands five times a day, 
as the CDC wants you to do during the 
pandemic, when you don’t have run-
ning water or flushed toilets? We need 
to keep working on this. It is a dis-
grace, to be honest. 
So what happened when COVID hit in 
this region? Because of a lack of sani-
tation and many other problems, pre-
cious lives were being lost. Elders, who 
are vital to pass on the traditional wis-
dom of the Native Alaskan culture and 
heritage, were being lost. Because of a 
lack of functioning sanitation, even 
young people, whom this virus doesn’t 
really impact, were starting to have 
respiratory illnesses and getting sick, 
and some were even dying. That is hor-
rible. It was terrifying, particularly for 
an area that is still dealing with the 
multigenerational trauma of previous 
pandemics, particularly the Spanish flu 
of 1918, which in several Alaskan Na-
tive communities wiped out entire 
communities; 60, 70 percent mortally 
rates from that flu. So we needed to 
get to work fast, particularly in this 
region. 
Enter another intrepid doctor and 
our Alaskan of the Week, Dr. Elizabeth 
Bates. Dr. Bates arrived in Bethel in 
December of 2018—just a little over 2 
years ago—and she found a community 
that she loved. She had experience 
working in women’s health and infec-
tion control and emergency care and 
disaster relief. She has great experi-
ence across the country—really, across 
the world. As a doctor, she worked with 
patients 
during 
9/11, 
Hurricane 
Katrina, and has spent time even in 
refugee camps in Rwanda. 
In Bethel, she was in charge of set-
ting up testing centers for the region. 
Working 
hand 
in 
glove 
with 
Dr. 
Hodges, she started one of the first 
drive-through and airport testing sites 
in rural Alaska, much of it outside in 
the cold weather under tarps. 
But we all know that testing alone, 
particularly, as I said, when people are 
living so closely together and don’t live 
in places where you can wash your 
hands 
frequently, 
wasn’t 
nearly 
enough. They tried everything—public 
service announcements, reaching out 
to villagers, helping them use bleach to 
sanitize. It was a 24/7 effort, but, as I 
said, it wasn’t enough. The virus was 
spreading rapidly. They were losing. 
People were dying. 
Then on December 18, a few days be-
fore winter solstice—the darkest day of 
the year—hope came to Bethel, AK, be-
cause 
the 
first 
vaccines 
arrived. 
Thanks to the great work of so many 
scientists, government workers, pri-
vate sector workers, Operation Warp 
Speed, the vaccine arrived on Decem-
ber 18 to the YK Delta. These two in-
trepid doctors I have been talking 
about cried. They had seen a lot of 
death and struggles in the region, and 
like a Christmas miracle, this vaccine 
arrived. They hugged each other, and 
then they got to work. 
As I said, there are roughly 50 remote 
villages in the YK Delta spread out 
over a territory about the size of many 
States in our country—as a matter of 
fact, bigger than most States in our 
country—so they traveled on small 
planes, trucks, on ice roads, snow ma-
chines, dog sleds. 
Their operation, Project Togo, is 
named in reference to one of the fa-
mous sled dogs that helped carry the 
diphtheria serum to Nome, which, of 
course, is the original inspiration for 
the Iditarod Sled Dog Race. Sometimes 
it was so cold that they had to keep the 
syringes 
filled 
with 
COVID 
serum 
under their clothes, lest the serum 
froze. 
The operation that they initiated and 
organized has hit every single village,

all 50 in the YK Delta, bringing the 
vaccine to pretty much anyone who 
wants it. In some villages, they have 
been able to vaccinate as much as half 
the population. As a result, the num-
bers of COVID infections and deaths 
are plummeting in this region, and 
hope is spreading. 
This great team, Drs. Hodges and 
Bates, as well as all in the community 
and all working at YKHC, have made a 
huge difference, and this team has cre-
ated a special bond that nobody will 
forget. 
Dr. Bates, a relative newcomer to 
Alaska, says that the experience has 
made her fall in love with the YK Delta 
region even more. She bought a home. 
She intends on staying. She describes 
the beauty of the region, something 
that she appreciates even more now, as 
‘‘Our sky is huge. . . . We have a front- 
row seat to the entire universe.’’ 
These two doctors also have a front- 
row seat in providing a front-row seat 
to hope during this pandemic. 
So I want to thank both of them 
again, Dr. Hodges and Dr. Bates, and 
all those across Alaska who are helping 
distribute the vaccine. 
As I mentioned, right now, Alaska is 
the No. 1 State in the country per cap-
ita in terms of vaccine distribution and 
the No. 1 State per capita in terms of 
testing and has one of the lowest death 
rates. This is really amazing, really, 
when you see how big and widespread 
and harsh the weather conditions can 
be in the great State of Alaska. 
Our fellow Alaskans are tough, resil-
ient, and innovative, and Dr. Hodges 
and Dr. Bates are a huge and essential 
part of this effort. That is why I want 
to congratulate them and thank them 
again for being our Alaskans of the 
Week.

REMEMBERING BILL NIGHBERT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
earlier this year, my home State of 
Kentucky 
said 
goodbye 
to 
Bill 
Nighbert, a longtime public servant 
and a kindhearted friend. Both as a 
local mayor and a statewide official, 
Bill was instrumental to the achieve-
ments of communities across our Com-
monwealth. Today, I would like to rec-
ognize his lifetime of contributions to 
Kentucky. 
As the Gateway to the Cumberlands, 
the city of Williamsburg holds a spe-
cial significance not just in South-
eastern Kentucky but for the entire 
Commonwealth. Bill worked several 
jobs for the city he loved before being 
elected mayor in 1993. For the next dec-
ade, the people of Williamsburg put 
their trust in him. In return, Bill 
worked around the clock to deliver for 
his community. Even in the city’s top 
job, Bill could still be found helping 
plow snow, deliver goods, or any other 
job that needed doing. A beloved local 
splash park is just one tangible exam-
ple of Bill’s leadership and vision for 
his city. 
As a successful mayor, Bill’s reputa-
tion grew across the Commonwealth. 
He was elected president of the Ken-
tucky League of Cities in 2002, using 
his talents to improve communities 
throughout the Bluegrass. Bill left city 
hall when Governor Ernie Fletcher 
tapped him to be deputy commissioner 
of the Department of Local Govern-
ment and later the secretary of the 
Transportation Cabinet. Even as Bill 
served the entire Commonwealth in 
Frankfort, he still took care of Whitley 
County. For instance, he was a driving 
force in the construction of a new 
interchange over I–75 near Williams-
burg. 
Apart from his professional work, 
Bill was legendary for his ability to 
make a friend in any situation. I guess 
you don’t become the president of the 
Optimists Club without a sunny dis-
position. He was a role model and a lit-
tle league coach, lending whatever free 
time he could find to a variety of local 
organizations. 
Of course, Bill’s greatest achieve-
ment was the love he shared with his 
wife of 34 years, Susan, as well as his 
children and their spouses, Brad and 
Monica, Renee and Chris, and Benton. 
Anyone who was lucky enough to know 
Bill could see the immense pride he 
had in his children and grandchildren. 
He said they were the reasons he dedi-
cated so much of his life to public serv-
ice. On behalf of the Senate, I send sin-
cere condolences to Bill’s friends and 
loved ones. We are grateful they shared 
him with us for so many years. Ken-
tucky was made better as a result.

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
NATIONAL 
LI-
BRARY SERVICE FOR THE BLIND 
AND PRINT DISABLED 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I rise 
today to recognize the National Li-
brary Service for the Blind and Print 
Disabled on its 90th anniversary. The 
National Library Service, or NLS, is an 
important part of the Library of Con-
gress, an institution that has long been 
committed to serving readers with dis-
abilities. The concept of a national li-
brary for the blind was introduced in 
1897 by the seventh Librarian of Con-
gress, John Russell Young, who estab-
lished a reading room for the blind that 
included more than 500 books and 
music items in raised characters. 
In 1913, Congress began to require 
that one copy of each book be made in 
raised characters and deposited in the 
Library of Congress for educational 
use; however, as impressive as this col-
lection was, it was only available to 
people who were able to visit in person. 
In 1930, legislation was introduced in 
both the House and the Senate to fund 
a Library of Congress program to pro-
vide service to blind readers on a na-
tional scale. This led to passage of the 
Pratt-Smoot Act which, on March 3, 
1931, established what we now know as 
the National Library Service for the 
Blind and Print Disabled. The act has 
been amended several times, not only 
increasing funding for the program, but 
also expanding service to children and 
people with physical and reading dis-
abilities and adding what is now the 
world’s largest accessible music mate-
rials collection. 
Missouri has wonderful local libraries 
that play a key role in connecting the 
NLS 
program 
to 
my 
constituents 
across the State. NLS and the Wolfner 
Talking Book and Braille Library serve 
nearly 6,500 individuals and more than 
600 intuitions in Missouri, providing 
daily access to all the incredible re-
sources NLS has to offer. 
NLS is continuing its innovative and 
adaptive approach to serving Ameri-
cans with disabilities. NLS has a vi-
brant history that spans phonograph 
records, cassette tapes, flash memory 
cartridges, and the internet, all while 
continuing to supply hardcopy and dig-
ital braille materials. With its mod-
ernization efforts underway, NLS no 
doubt has a very exciting future ahead. 
Today, it is my pleasure to congratu-
late NLS on its 90th anniversary. I 
wish the wonderful staff at NLS con-
tinued success as they work to ensure 
the NLS mission ‘‘that all may read.’’ 
TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER 
PICKENS 
Mr. 
WICKER. 
Madam 
President, 
today I wish to recognize Mr. Chris-
topher Pickens, a Knauss Sea Grant 
fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
Mr. Pickens has had a significant im-
pact during his time as a fellow. His ex-
pertise on fisheries management and 
ocean sciences has meaningfully con-
tributed to the committee’s efforts. He 
has worked on several pieces of legisla-
tion that have passed the Senate or 
have become law, such as the FLOODS 
Act and the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric 
Administration 
Commis-
sioned Officer Corps Amendments Act. 
His contributions will help improve 
ocean and flood monitoring to keep 
Americans safe, promote deep sea 
ocean exploration, and inform the 
stewardship of our Nation’s marine re-
sources. 
I would like to extend my sincere 
thanks and appreciation to Mr. Pick-
ens for all of the fine work he has done 
and wish him luck in the years to 
come.

∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I

Supporting Our Veterans 
Every day, men and women in the military 
risk their lives for the protection of their fel-
low citizens. The ideology of our nation de-
pends on their service. Yet every day, vet-
erans across the country face issues regard-
ing claim approvals, mental health, and 
post-service employment. 
The lengthy claim approval process and 
36% claim granting rate is something that 
many veterans encounter. The issue is not 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ 
generous budget, but how the money is 
spent, and the efficiency/availability of the 
benefits being offered. The VA should hire 
more people to process claims in order to 
shorten the processing time, which is cur-
rently four months or longer on average. 
Hiring veterans in these positions would also 
address unemployment issues. Additionally, 
more guidance should be given on how to file 
a 
claim. 
This 
includes 
identifying 
the 
quickest claim type and specifying what 
medical information should be given. Lastly, 
the VA only approves claims for illnesses 
and injuries which they deem to be a direct 
cause of service. Extending this to all serious 
illnesses and injuries throughout life, or at 
least partial financial and medical support, 
would be extremely beneficial to veterans 
and could even improve their mental health. 
Studies have shown that veterans have a 
higher risk for alcohol/drug abuse, and sui-
cide. One in five veterans suffer from mental 
health problems like PTSD, depression, and 
severe anxiety. Veterans account for 13.8% of 
the suicides in America, and for over a dec-
ade 17–18 veterans have died daily from sui-
cide. We cannot take away their experiences, 
but offering more support in their recovery 
is the least we can do. Many veterans with 
mental health problems are not aware of 
their condition, or are too embarrassed to 
ask for help. Educating veterans (especially 
while serving) about signs and effects of 
mental health problems, and the care and 
treatment available to them, could save 
lives. Additionally, implementing a mental 
health scan for veterans every few years 
could be very effective in identifying these 
issues early on, and opening thousands of 
veterans’ eyes to the care available to them. 
Enforcing 
quality-of-care 
standards 
for 
treatment in all mental health care facilities 
would also benefit the nation. 
American veterans receive very effective 
military training and preparation, but are 
rarely prepared for post-service employment. 
Studies suggest the unemployment rate for 
veterans is considerably higher than their ci-
vilian counterparts. This can be attributed 
to the rarity of higher education and the nu-
merous mental health issues among vet-
erans. Increasing accessibility and lowering 
costs for college education would broaden 
the post-service career opportunities for 
countless veterans. Lower tuition rates for 
veterans could be paid for by the VA, with 
the extra money resulting from having to 
offer less veterans unemployment benefits. 
Our nation cannot forget the selfless sac-
rifices our soldiers and military families 
make. Brave women and men have been tak-
ing care of this nation for almost 250 years. 
It’s time we start taking care of them. 
LING BUSHEY, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY, 
FAIRFAX, SENIOR 
The sexual health education and cur-
riculum in America is not adequate to our 
current society, and should be focused on im-
mensely to ensure better health in our youth 
population. Kids are not educated on the top-
ics revolving around sexual health, and this 
leads to struggling mental health effects and 
potentially life changing decisions that 
teens should be informed on. 
Ignorance on sexual orientation, contra-
ceptives, and diseases leads to a dangerous 
society, where teens are unaware of con-
sequences and ignorant to possible solutions 
of preventions. According to the USC De-
partment of Nursing, nearly 750,000 teenagers 
in the United States will become pregnant 
this year; and half of the 20 million new 
cases of sexually transmitted diseases will be 
diagnosed in young people ages 15 to 24. 
Being informed about the physical, mental, 
and emotional changes in a teenagers’ life 
and environment will benefit not only the 
person 
learning, 
but 
relationships 
sur-
rounding them for years to come. By start-
ing to educate kids in middle school will nor-
malize these discussions to be had later on, 
and create a more open and unjudged envi-
ronment. According to the United Nations, 
understanding one’s own body is a human 
right, and the US needs to address a human’s 
right to learn about their body and have leg-
islature and youth service providers fund and 
educate a coherent and inclusive sexual edu-
cation across the nation. 
A guaranteed cohesive program or set cur-
riculum addressing sexual health, will also 
allow for schools to help inform kids in the 
LGBTQ community, what the subject is and 
how to respect and support members that are 
a part. The importance of educating a posi-
tive outlook sexual orientation, and safe 
hetero and homosexual activities is crucial. 
Only 24 states mandate sex education, which 
is unacceptable. America needs to educate

teens on the opposite sex’s changes during 
puberty, and normalize these changes as 
they are inevitable. Mandating sexual edu-
cation in schools will give students a coher-
ent safe space to learn about these topics, 
which might not be offered and found from 
other inaccurate sources which leads to false 
information and mis-interpretations. 
While this might be a tedious and drawn 
out process, our legislature should mandate 
sexual education across the nation by mak-
ing a federal law. This law would teach an all 
inclusive comprehensive curriculum across 
all states. Overall this would positively af-
fect teens all across America and would take 
a step towards a brighter and better future. 
Along with this federal mandate we need to 
make teens and young adults have access to 
a planned parenthood or a trusted medically 
accurate source to trust and rely on for in-
formation. Especially during these strenuous 
times during this pandemic, the availability 
of these sources are more crucial than ever. 
FATIMA KHAN, ESSEX HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
July 17, 2014: ‘‘I Can’t Breathe.’’ These 
were the last words of Eric Garner. A 43- 
year-old father of six children. A man who 
was known as the ‘‘neighborhood peace-
maker.’’ Eric Garner was an unarmed black 
man, who was choked to death by Daniel 
Pantaleo, a New York City police officer, as 
he repeatedly pleaded for him to stop. 
May 25, 2020: ‘‘I Can’t Breathe.’’ These were 
the last words of George Floyd. A 46-year-old 
father of one daughter. A man who wanted to 
‘‘touch the world.’’ George Floyd was an un-
armed black man, who died when Min-
neapolis 
police 
officer, 
Derek 
Chauvin, 
pressed his knee into his neck, for 8 minutes 
and 46 seconds, as he repeatedly pleaded for 
him to stop. 
The murder of Eric Garner, in 2014, ignited 
fierce emotions and propelled people into ac-
tion, all over the country. A developing 
project which began as a response to the 
murder of Trayvon Martin, was beginning to 
receive national attention. It was known as 
Black Lives Matter. Today, BLM is one of 
the 
most 
influential 
social 
movements 
today, and among many human rights issues, 
it has awakened the eyes of the nation to the 
issue of police brutality. 
Although we have come a long way in our 
work against police brutality since 2014, 
there is still plenty of work to do. Black 
Americans are disproportionately affected 
by police violence across the US. According 
to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health, black Americans are 3.23 times more 
likely than white Americans to be killed by 
police. In order to truly combat this issue, 
there needs to be a reformation of our police 
departments. 
To do so, the responsibilities of police offi-
cers relating to mental health, homelessness, 
and drug abuse, needs to be pared back. Ac-
cording to the US Department of Justice, 
there are over 10 million arrests, annually. 
Only a small fraction of those are violent 
crimes. This makes the US the world’s larg-
est jailer, housing about 25 percent of the 
world’s prisoners. Police departments are 
overworked and our jails are overcrowded. 
Overcriminalization has led to mass incar-
ceration in our criminal justice system. To 
address overcriminalization, policymakers 
should consider what offenses result in con-
viction 
and 
prison 
time, 
and 
reduce 
arrestable offenses. More resources should be 
put into education and training for officers, 
not 
arrests. 
Additionally, 
more 
mental 
health professionals should be deployed as 
first responders. 
We also have to hold every police officer 
accountable to the law. Too many times, po-
lice officers who have broken the law, 
haven’t faced adequate consequences for 
their actions, because of qualified immunity. 
Qualified immunity has protected police offi-
cers in cases where they have disgustingly 
abused their power. Victims whose constitu-
tional rights have been violated have been 
denied justice. By altering this doctrine, we 
can ensure that nobody is above the law. In-
creasing the consequences of misconduct, 
will weed out the bad apples in our police de-
partments. 
By critically reforming our police depart-
ments, we can ensure a more equitable fu-
ture for all Americans.∑

States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with re-
spect to the actions and policies of cer-
tain members of the Government of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions is to continue in effect 
beyond March 6, 2021. 
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has 
not made the necessary political and 
economic reforms that would warrant 
terminating the existing targeted sanc-
tions program. 
Throughout the last year, govern-
ment security services routinely in-
timidated and violently repressed citi-
zens, including members of opposition 
political parties, union members, and 
journalists. The absence of progress on 
the most fundamental reforms needed 
to ensure the rule of law, democratic 
governance, and the protection of 
human rights leaves Zimbabweans vul-
nerable to ongoing repression and pre-
sents a continuing threat to peace and 
security in the region. 
The actions and policies of certain 
members 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288, as amended, with respect to 
Zimbabwe and to maintain in force the 
sanctions to respond to this threat.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and 
Mr. SCHATZ): 
S. 554. A bill to require the Secretary 
of Agriculture to conduct a study on 
the establishment of, and the potential 
land that could be included in, a unit of 
the National Forest System in the 
State of Hawaii, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a bill that requires 
the Secretary of Agriculture to con-
duct a study on the establishment of, 
and the potential land that could be in-
cluded in, a unit of the National Forest 
System in the State of Hawaii. 
The U.S. Forest Service currently 
oversees more than 150 National forests 
that receive Federal funding for water-
shed protection, wildlife conservation, 
enhancement of recreational access, 
wildfire 
prevention, 
among 
other 
things. Despite having unique forest 
ecosystems found nowhere else in the 
Nation, Hawaii is currently among the 
few States that do not have a National 
Forest. If warranted, a National Forest 
designation in Hawaii could provide ad-
ditional Federal research and manage-
ment resources. 
This bill directs the U.S. Department 
of 
Agriculture 
Secretary, 
acting 
through the Chief of the U.S. Forest 
Service, to conduct a study in coordi-
nation with the Hawaii Department of 
Land and Natural Resources, and in 
consultation with the Hawaii Depart-
ment of Agriculture as well as other 
State and local stakeholders, on the is-
lands of Hawaii, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, 
Lanai, and Maui. 
This 
study 
would, 
among 
other 
things, assess unique vegetation types, 
opportunities to improve and protect 
forest resources, secure favorable water 
flows, and opportunities for visitor use. 
The Secretary of Agriculture is given 
three years to conduct the study and 
report the results to Congress. Infor-
mation from that report will then in-
form which lands in Hawaii, if any, 
would be suitable for inclusion in a Na-
tional Forest. This bill is supported by 
the Hawaii Department of Land and 
Natural Resources. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. CANTWELL): 
S. 557. A bill to establish a pilot pro-
gram for native plant species, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Native Plant 
Species Pilot Program Act. I am 
pleased to be partnering with Senator 
CANTWELL on this initiative. Our bipar-
tisan bill would create a new pilot pro-
gram at the National Park Service to 
support the use of native plants, and 
would direct the Park Service to re-
view existing data and study the cost- 
effectiveness of using native plants. 
Native plants are species found natu-
rally in regions and can add beauty and 
value to our National Park System. 
Benefits range from using less water 
and pesticides, purifying the air, and 
recharging groundwater in wetlands. 
By using native species, the Park Serv-
ice can also improve habitat for wild-
life and restore important species of 
birds and butterflies to their natural 
environment. 
In Acadia National Park, native 
plants are an important part of the on-
going conservation efforts undertaken 
by Superintendent Kevin Schneider 
and all those who work to encourage 
the use of native plants. Acadia Na-
tional Park protects more than 900 
plant species, including some that are 
globally, nationally, and locally rare. 
Acadia 
is 
home 
to 
the 
vibrant 
rhodoras that flower along wetland 
edges in the spring and stunning wood 
lilies that bloom on the mountain tops

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1028 
March 3, 2021 
in August, helping to attract the more 
than 3.5 million visitors a year to the 
seventh most-visited national park in 
the United States. The Wild Gardens of 
Acadia, located at Sieur de Monts, are 
a collection of more than 400 native 
plants maintained almost exclusively 
by park volunteers and represent the 
natural plant communities found with-
in Acadia National Park. This partner-
ship project with Friends of Acadia al-
lows visitors to easily step through the 
park’s myriad habitats and learn about 
the splendor of Acadia’s native plant 
species. The Wild Gardens celebrates 
its 60th anniversary in 2021. 
Native plants, however, face many 
threats, such as non-native pests, non- 
native plants, diseases, and a changing 
climate. Today, almost one quarter of 
Acadia National Park’s species are 
non-native to the park. The red spruce, 
iconic to Acadia, is projected to lose a 
substantial amount of its habitat in 
coming decades because of climate 
change. In addition, invasive pests, 
such as the Emerald Ash Borer and the 
hemlock woolly adelgid are affecting 
northern forests and have expanded 
into Maine. Hemlock woolly adelgid re-
cently infested hemlock trees just out-
side of the park on Mount Desert Is-
land. 
Our bipartisan bill has earned en-
dorsements from the Garden Club of 
America, Friends of Acadia, Scenic 
America, and the Native Plant Center 
at Westchester Community College. I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation to help protect the natural 
landscapes at our national parks for 
years to come. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Mr. ROUNDS): 
S. 569. A bill to direct the Secretary 
of Agriculture to transfer certain Na-
tional Forest System land to the State 
of South Dakota, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 572. A bill to provide for the water 
quality restoration of the Tijuana 
River and the New River, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to re-introduce the ‘‘Border 
Water Quality Restoration and Protec-
tion Act.’’ 
For over two decades, cleaning up the 
Tijuana River Valley has been one of 
my top priorities for Southern Cali-
fornia. The wastewater, trash and sedi-
ment that continues to flow into San 
Diego and Imperial Counties is an 
alarming danger to public health and 
our economy. Although we have made 
recent strides in cleaning up this pollu-
tion, there is much work remaining. 
That’s why I am proud to introduce 
this important legislation, once again, 
to help address this decades-long issue. 
I am very pleased Senator PADILLA has 
joined me as an original cosponsor and 
I look forward to working with him on 
this important issue. 
Polluted water from the Tijuana and 
New Rivers flows north across the bor-
der into the United States causing un-
sanitary water conditions, pollution 
and beach closures across Southern 
California. It also jeopardizes military 
training exercises for Navy Seals in 
Camp Pendleton. 
Three-quarters of the 1,700-square- 
mile Tijuana River watershed lies in 
Mexico. However, the watershed, along 
with all its pollutants, drains into San 
Diego County and the Tijuana River 
Valley. 
In addition to jeopardizing human 
health and safety, two of the most 
drastic effects from this cross-border 
water pollution are harm to wildlife 
and damage to the tourism industry, 
integral to Southern Californian com-
munities. As the coronavirus pandemic 
continues to threaten our nation’s 
health and economy, it is critical we 
work to address the pollution in the re-
gion so California can welcome visitors 
back to their beaches when it is safe to 
do so. 
The beaches in the region are central 
to San Diego’s tourism economy. In re-
cent years, beaches in the communities 
of Coronado and Imperial Beach were 
closed for more than 200 days in a sin-
gle year due to pollution. 
Health and safety of residents and 
workers are also at risk. In recent 
years, local Border Patrol union offi-
cials reported that 80 officers suffered 
from contamination, rashes, infections, 
chemical burns and lung irritation due 
to toxic cross-border flows. 
In addition, pollution from Mexico 
harms sensitive areas that provide crit-
ical habitat for more than 300 species 
of birds as well as marine animals like 
leopard sharks and bottlenose dolphins. 
The region is home to multiple parks 
and public lands, including the Tijuana 
River’s National Estuarine Research 
Reserve, the River Mouth State Marine 
Conservation Area and River Valley 
Regional Park Preserve. 
The harmful effects of pollution in 
the Tijuana River Valley on our resi-
dents, businesses, economy and envi-
ronment are simply unacceptable. 
In February 2020, the Government 
Accountability Office issued a com-
prehensive 
report, 
‘‘International 
Boundary Water Commission: Opportu-
nities Exist to Address Water Quality 
Problems.’’ My office worked closely 
with the GAO to utilize their findings 
to craft meaningful change through 
this legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1029 
March 3, 2021 
Simultaneously, we were able to se-
cure $300 million in the U.S.-Mexico- 
Canada trade agreement to address pol-
lution in the Tijuana River Valley Wa-
tershed. 
With significant funding and detailed 
findings by the GAO investigation, we 
developed this legislation in concert 
with federal, state and local agency 
input. As beaches in both the United 
States and Mexico continue to close 
due to high levels of pollution, it is as 
imperative as ever to advance a solu-
tion that engages all stakeholders. 
The Border Water Quality Restora-
tion and Protection Act includes key 
reforms to advance concrete solutions. 
One of the problems is that no one 
agency is in charge of this problem. A 
whole range of agencies—EPA, Inter-
national Boundary and Water Commis-
sion, State Department, Department of 
Homeland Security, Customs and Bor-
der Protection, Defense Department— 
all have jurisdiction or interest in this 
international issue. 
What we need is one agency in 
charge, taking input from the others so 
decisions can be made. This approach is 
similar to other large, regional envi-
ronmental challenges like the Great 
Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Everglades and 
Chesapeake Bay. Here in California, we 
have also seen great success with this 
model of interagency coordination at 
Lake Tahoe. 
Here’s how the bill would work: 
The EPA would be officially named 
the agency with overall control of this 
effort. 
The EPA, along with its federal, 
state and local partners, would be di-
rected to identify a list of priority 
projects. It also would be authorized to 
accept and distribute funds to build, 
operate and maintain those projects. 
The bill would permanently author-
ize the Border Water Infrastructure 
Program to manage storm water runoff 
and water reuse projects. 
State and local authorities would 
also be authorized to contribute fund-
ing to federal projects, which is cur-
rently not allowed. 
The 
International 
Boundary 
and 
Water Commission would be authorized 
to mitigate storm water from Mexico 
and the pollution that comes with it 
and is required to construct, operate 
and maintain projects on the priority 
list developed by the agencies within 
the U.S. that improve water quality. 
We need a new and comprehensive ap-
proach to this issue that has plagued 
border communities for too long. This 
bill creates a formal process to con-
sider effective, long-term solutions and 
additional wastewater infrastructure 
to mitigate cross-border pollution and 
I hope the Senate can move on this bill 
quickly. 
I want to thank California Environ-
mental Protection Agency, California 
Natural Resources Agency, San Diego 
and Imperial counties, cities of Impe-
rial Beach and Coronado, Mayor of 
Chula Vista, Mary Casillas Salas, the 
City of San Diego and the Port of San 
Diego for supporting this legislation. 
These communities, and others, have 
been negatively impacted by this issue 
for far too long. 
It’s past time that we finally solve 
this problem to safeguard local health 
and economic growth. 
Once again, I thank Senator PADILLA 
for his cosponsorship. Thank you, Mr. 
President. I yield the floor. 
By Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina

March 3, 2021 
The program helped States, local 
governments, and nonprofit organiza-
tions acquire properties and rehabili-
tate or repurpose them as long-term af-
fordable housing. 
Between 2008 and 2019, Neighborhood 
Stabilization Program funds have fa-
cilitated the construction or rehabili-
tation of more than 50,000 homes, and 
the program has generated $1.8 billion 
in return income, allowing commu-
nities to stretch Federal investments 
even further. 
Today, more than 7.4 million units of 
affordable housing are needed across 
the U.S. to meet the needs of low-in-
come renters. In my home State of 
California, more than 1.4 million units 
are needed to address the State’s af-
fordable housing shortage. 
Due to financial burdens and loss of 
income resulting from the COVID–19 
pandemic, millions of people in the 
United States are at risk of eviction or 
foreclosure, and the need for more af-
fordable housing is expected to in-
crease dramatically. 
In addition to making long-term in-
vestments in building new affordable 
housing in the United States, it is also 
critically important to focus resources 
on more immediate solutions, such as 
acquiring and rehabilitating existing 
buildings. 
Acquisition and rehabilitation pro-
vides two distinct advantages: it lowers 
per-unit construction costs and makes 
affordable housing units available to 
low-income households much faster. 
The ‘‘Affordable Housing Redevelop-
ment Act’’ would reauthorize and ex-
pand the Neighborhood Stabilization 
Program to help State and local gov-
ernments purchase blighted, vacant, 
abandoned, foreclosed, or surplus prop-
erties, and convert them into afford-
able housing. Eligible projects would 
include mixed-use development and 
conversions of non-residential office 
and retail properties. 
All new units would have to serve 
households whose income does not ex-
ceed area median income, and at least 
25 percent of units would serve house-
holds whose income does not exceed 50 
percent of area median income. Long- 
term affordability requirements would 
apply in all cases. 
The bill would authorize $1.5 billion 
in discretionary appropriations to be 
allocated as a competitive grant pro-
gram administered by the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. 
This bill provides a targeted and cost 
effective way for the Federal govern-
ment to help communities build more 
affordable housing, while also stimu-
lating local economies and creating 
jobs. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 582 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal 
Death Penalty Prohibition Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IMPOSITION OF DEATH 
SENTENCE. 
(a) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of law, no person may be sen-
tenced to death or put to death on or after 
the date of enactment of this Act for any 
violation of Federal law. 
(b) PERSONS SENTENCED BEFORE DATE
OF 
ENACTMENT.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other 
provision of law, any person sentenced to 
death before the date of enactment of this 
Act for any violation of Federal law shall be 
resentenced. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
YOUNG, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr. 
LEE, Mr. COONS, Mr. GRASSLEY, 
Mr. PAUL, and Mr. DURBIN): 
S.J. Res. 10. A joint resolution to re-
peal the authorizations for use of mili-
tary force against Iraq, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am 
pleased today to introduce in the Sen-
ate, 
with 
my 
colleagues 
Senators 
YOUNG, 
DUCKWORTH, 
LEE, 
COONS, 
GRASSLEY, DURBIN and PAUL a bipar-
tisan resolution to repeal the 1991 and 
2002 Authorizations for Use of Military 
Force (AUMF) against Iraq. This legis-
lation will formally end the authoriza-
tions for the Gulf and Iraq wars—30 and 
19 
years, 
respectively, 
after 
these 
AUMFs were first passed, reasserting 
Congress’ vital role in not only declar-
ing wars, but in ending them. The re-
peal of these authorizations also recog-
nizes the strong partnership the United 
States now has with a sovereign, demo-
cratic Iraq. 
The United States is no longer at war 
with Iraq and our legal frameworks 
should reflect this reality as much as 
our policy frameworks, to include the 
Strategic Framework Agreement that 
Iraq and the United States signed in 
November 2008, which affirms the es-
tablishment of a long-term relation-
ship of cooperation and friendship, 
based on the principle of equality in 
sovereignty and the rights and prin-
ciples that are enshrined in the United 
Nations Charter. 
Since 2014, U.S. troops have been in 
Iraq, alongside Iraqi forces, at the Gov-
ernment of Iraq’s request for assistance 
in combating the Islamic State of Iraq 
and Syria (ISIS). Current Administra-
tion 
officials, 
including 
President 
Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, Sec-
retary of Defense Austin and Com-
mander of the United States Central 
Command, General McKenzie, have 
routinely 
emphasized 
that 
United 
States military forces remain in Iraq 
at the invitation of the Government of 
Iraq and in respect to its sovereignty. 
Recent 
presidential 
administrations 
have maintained that the 2002 AUMF 
only serves to ‘‘reinforce’’ any legal au-
thority to combat ISIS provided by the 
2001 AUMF and is not independently re-
quired to authorize any such activities. 
As such, repealing the 1991 AUMF and 
the 2002 AUMF would not affect ongo-
ing United States military operations. 
It would however, prevent the future 
misuse of the Gulf and Iraq War au-
thorizations and strengthen Congres-
sional oversight over war powers. 
It is past time to repeal both AUMFs 
and formally mark the end of the Iraq 
War that resulted in a devastating loss 
of life and wounded tens of thousands 
of our troops. It makes no sense that 
two AUMFs remain in place against a 
country that is now a close partner. 
They serve no operational purpose, run 
the risk of future abuse by the Presi-
dent, and help keep our nation at per-
manent war. 
I am proud to join this group of Sen-
ators in introducing a bill to repeal 
these outdated and unnecessary au-
thorizations. I hope we can continue to 
find bipartisan compromise on these 
tough war power issues to include re-
vising and replacing the 2001 AUMF.

S. RES. 87 
Whereas any relief and long-term recovery 
from the economic fallout of the COVID–19 
pandemic must recognize, rebuild, and re-
turn mothers to the workforce; 
Whereas women, and especially working 
mothers, are bearing the brunt of the eco-
nomic fallout from the COVID–19 pandemic 
as a result of existing social barriers and pol-
icy failures such as— 
(1) the lack of a care infrastructure, in-
cluding child care deserts and lack of care 
infrastructure caused by high child care 
costs; 
(2) the lack of family-supportive work-
places; 
(3) the lack of a national paid leave policy; 
and 
(4) gender and racial pay inequity;

March 3, 2021 
the first time in almost a decade, even as 
women continued to face unjust gender and 
racial wage gaps; 
Whereas 2,300,000 women have left the 
labor force since the beginning of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including 275,000 who 
exited in January 2021; 
Whereas participation by women in the 
labor force was less than 55 percent in April 
2020 for the first time since 1986, in part be-
cause of the child care crisis caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas participation by women age 20 
and older in the labor force fell to a 33-year 
low in January 2021, hitting 57 percent; 
Whereas women— 
(1) have suffered the majority of pandemic- 
related job losses; and 
(2) have lost over 5,400,000 net jobs since 
February 2020, and account for 55 percent of 
overall net job loss since the start of the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas 86 percent of net jobs lost in De-
cember 2020 were jobs held by women, with 
women losing 196,000 jobs during that month; 
Whereas mothers in the prime of their 
working lives have paid an especially high 
price, with mothers ages 25 to 54 experi-
encing a 5.7-percentage point decline in em-
ployment since the COVID–19 pandemic 
began, compared to a 3.1 percentage-point 
decline for fathers in the same age group; 
Whereas women are overrepresented in 
low-wage jobs and underrepresented in high- 
wage jobs; 
Whereas employment in the bottom quar-
tile of the wage distribution has declined by 
17 percent since February 2020, far exceeding 
the overall employment decline of 6.5 per-
cent; 
Whereas wages for women are key to the 
economic security of the families of such 
women; 
Whereas women of color play a particu-
larly vital role in the financial stability of 
their families, and any disruption to their 
earnings can be detrimental to the welfare of 
their families; 
Whereas the absence of affordable child 
care exacerbates inequality by severely in-
hibiting low-income parents from attaining 
promotions and higher salaries; 
Whereas child nutrition is strongly linked 
to the employment status of mothers, such 
that almost 1 in 4 children experienced food 
insecurity in 2020 at the same time that 
mothers experienced work disruptions or un-
employment that led to income loss; 
Whereas work interruptions caused by 
school closures and child care closures have 
disproportionately impacted women, forcing 
women to reduce work hours, take a leave of 
absence, or permanently leave the work-
force; 
Whereas, without reliable and affordable 
child care, mothers who have left the work-
force will not be able to return to work, 
since such mothers often cannot pay for 
child care without the income made from 
going back to work; 
Whereas essential workers who are single 
parents face additional challenges and great-
er financial burden due to needing affordable 
child care; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has exac-
erbated existing stigmas against working 
mothers that falsely assume that their role 
as caregivers will negatively impact their 
work performance; 
Whereas mothers forced to permanently 
leave the workforce or reduce work hours be-
cause of the COVID–19 pandemic are experi-
encing career trajectory disruptions that 
lower their lifetime earnings potential and 
endanger their future Social Security earn-
ings and other potential retirement income; 
Whereas child care is a lifeline for working 
mothers, and over 75 percent of mothers with 
children younger than age 10 say child care 
is one of their top 3 challenges during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, in 2019, before the COVID–19 pan-
demic hit the United States, there were 
roughly 9,700,000 working mothers with a 
child younger than age 6; 
Whereas 95 percent of the child care work-
force is comprised of women, and yet nearly 
2⁄3 of child care workers with children report 
problems with accessing public support pro-
grams and often struggle to afford high-qual-
ity child care for their own families; 
Whereas 60 percent of businesses in the 
child care industry are minority-owned; 
Whereas a significant investment in child 
care would be simultaneously job creating 
and job enabling, creating care jobs and sup-
porting parental employment, both of which 
would benefit women; 
Whereas women of color are disproportion-
ately represented in many frontline indus-
tries that also lack critical benefits such as 
paid sick leave and flexibility to telework, 
including food services, hospitality, retail, 
and social assistance; 
Whereas the unprecedented burdens of 
child care, work, and remote learning have 
strained the mental and emotional health of 
mothers; and 
Whereas access to paid leave during the 
COVID–19 pandemic has been linked to a re-
duction in the spread of COVID–19 by as 
many as 15,000 new cases per day where peo-
ple were able to use the leave, such that paid 
leave 
has 
prevented 
the 
compounded 
stressors of countless evictions, hospitaliza-
tions, and hungry children: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) mothers, especially mothers of color, 
have been pushed to the brink of economic, 
social, and emotional collapse during the 
COVID–19 pandemic because of the existing 
economic and social inequalities that women 
have long faced; 
(2) any relief and long-term recovery pack-
age to address the COVID–19 crisis should 
recognize and rebuild moms in the work-
force, in order to secure meaningful and sus-
tainable economic recovery, by including, at 
a minimum— 
(A) a robust paid leave plan, which is es-
sential to securing the physical health and 
financial health of families, including emer-
gency paid leave policies that would create a 
path toward permanent paid leave solutions; 
(B) the means to rebuild and stabilize the 
child care industry, which is essential to eco-
nomic recovery and bolstering women in the 
labor force; 
(C) major investments in our education 
systems, which must be made in order to 
safely reopen schools and campuses, pro-
viding funding to support and protect the 
safety and health of educators, support staff, 
students, and families; 
(D) recurring child benefits, and expanded 
and improved child tax credit and earned in-
come tax credit to help reduce child poverty 
and provide economic security for families; 
(E) an expanded unemployment insurance 
program that benefits struggling workers, 
including those experiencing long-term un-
employment; and 
(F) access to mental health support for 
mothers, which is essential to maintaining 
the health of the family; and 
(3) employers and policymakers in the 
United States must prioritize addressing the 
economic cliff facing mothers, and make per-
manent the aforementioned policies so that 
mothers are protected against any future 
economic calamities.

Mr. BRAUN, Mr. ROUNDS, and Mr. 
HOEVEN) submitted the following reso-

mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs: 
S. RES. 88 
Whereas the national debt of the United 
States is $27,900,000,000,000; 
Whereas this represents $223,441 in debt per 
taxpayer; 
Where 
Congress 
appropriated 
over 
$4,000,000,000,000 on a bipartisan basis to ad-
dress COVID–19 during 2020; 
Whereas 
Congress 
passed 
additional 
COVID–19 relief legislation as part of the bi-
partisan-bicameral omnibus COVID–19 relief 
deal on December 21, 2020; 
Whereas the latest reports from the Con-
gressional Budget Office indicate that a sub-
stantial portion of funds previously allocated 
remain unspent; 
Whereas Congress needs reliable informa-
tion on unspent funds before it should con-
sider allocating additional dollars; 
Whereas, according to Center for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget, the proposed American 
Rescue Plan allocates less than 10 percent of 
its total funding to directly combat COVID– 
19 needs; 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Budget Office, the level of spending in the 
proposed American Rescue Plan is at least 3 
times the size of the output shortfall in our 
economy, which will lead to higher inflation; 
and 
Whereas, almost half of the American Res-
cue Plan would not be spent until fiscal year 
2022 or later, with at least $140,000,000,000 not 
being spent until fiscal year 2024 or later: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the President is requested

ABRANCHES TO SAVE THE LIVES 
OF FRENCH JEWS AND OTHER

DURING

CAUST 
Mr. ROMNEY (for himself and Mr. 
MURPHY) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 89 
Whereas Nazi Germany invaded France on 
May 10, 1940, and after brief but intense hos-
tilities, secured the surrender of France on 
June 22, 1940; 
Whereas, as a consequence of the Nazi con-
quest, the lives of French Jews and Jewish 
and non-Jewish persons of other nationali-
ties seeking refuge in France were put in 
grave and imminent danger; 
Whereas many thousands of those persons 
fled to Bordeaux, France, and elsewhere in 
southwest France, seeking to traverse Spain 
and escape to Portugal; 
Whereas, in 1939, the Government of Por-
tugal under Antonio de Oliveira Salazar 
issued Circular 14, which sharply restricted 
the availability of visas to displaced persons; 
Whereas the Consul General of Portugal in 
Bordeaux was Dr. Aristides de Sousa Mendes 
do Amaral e Abranches; 
Whereas, in June 1940, confronting a hu-
manitarian crisis and in defiance of Circular 
14, Sousa Mendes, assisted principally by his 
diplomatic 
colleagues 
Jose 
de 
Seabra, 
Manuel de Vieira Braga, and Emile Gissot, 
issued without charge tens of thousands of 
visas, including thousands to fleeing Jews; 
Whereas Sousa Mendes reportedly stated, 
‘‘I declare that I shall give, free of charge, a 
visa to whosoever shall request it. My desire 
is to be with God against Man rather than 
with Man and against God.’’; 
Whereas those visas, as well as Sousa 
Mendes’ personal intervention at the border 
between France and Spain, enabled the refu-
gees to reach safety in Portugal; 
Whereas, in July 1940, the Government of 
Portugal under Oliveira Salazar responded 
by recalling Sousa Mendes, dismissing Sousa 
Mendes later from active diplomatic service, 
and subjecting him to economic retribution 
and subsequent ostracism; 
Whereas, in 1941, Sousa Mendes explained, 
‘‘In truth, I disobeyed, but my disobedience 
does not dishonor me. I chose to defy an 
order that to me represented the persecution 
of true castaways who sought with all their 
strength to be saved from Hitler’s wrath. 
Above the order, for me, was God’s law, and 
that’s the one I have always sought to ad-
here to without hesitation. The true lesson 
of Christianity is to love one’s neighbor.’’; 
Whereas, in 1954, Sousa Mendes died penni-
less in Lisbon, Portugal, under the cloud of 
the discipline imposed for his defiance; 
Whereas, in 1966, Yad Vashem recognized 
Sousa Mendes as a Righteous Among the Na-
tions for his selfless efforts to save Jewish 
lives at personal risk to himself, making 
Sousa Mendes the first of a number of diplo-
matic rescuers to be so honored; 
Whereas, in 1988, the United States Senate 
passed Senate Resolution 270, 110th Congress, 
agreed to June 23, 1988, to commemorate 
Sousa Mendes’ humanitarian efforts; 
Whereas, in 1986, President of Portugal 
Mario Soares posthumously rehabilitated 
Sousa Mendes, decorating Sousa Mendes as 
an Officer of the Order of Liberty; 
Whereas, in 1988, the Parliament of Por-
tugal posthumously granted Sousa Mendes 
the status of Ambassador; 
Whereas, in 1995, President of Portugal 
Mario Soares posthumously bestowed on 
Sousa Mendes the Grand Cross of the Order 
of Christ; 
Whereas, in 2017, President of Portugal 
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa posthumously be-
stowed on Sousa Mendes Portugal’s highest 
honor, the Grand Cross of the Order of Lib-
erty; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Parliament of Por-
tugal unanimously voted to memorialize 
Sousa Mendes in the National Pantheon in 
Lisbon; and 
Whereas, in 2020, on the 80th anniversary of 
his heroism, the United States Commission 
for the Preservation of America’s Heritage 
Abroad initiated commemorations in honor 
of Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux, France, and 
Portugal: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors and salutes the humanitarian 
and principled work of Dr. Aristides de Sousa 
Mendes do Amaral e Abranches, Consul of 
Portugal in Bordeaux, France, for acting 
with great courage and at personal risk to 
issue transit visas to French Jews and other 
persons, sparing them from Nazi occupation 
and the Holocaust, thus saving many thou-
sands of innocent lives; 
(2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to 
transmit copies of this resolution to the 
President; and 
(3) requests that the President transmit a 
copy of this resolution to the President of 
Portugal and the President of the Assembly 
of the Republic of Portugal.

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 90 
Whereas school counselors are more impor-
tant now than ever, as the COVID–19 pan-
demic has magnified the mental health crisis 
among the youth of our Nation; 
Whereas the American School Counselor 
Association 
has 
designated 
February 
1 
through 5, 2021, as ‘‘National School Coun-
seling Week’’; 
Whereas school counselors have long advo-
cated for equitable opportunities for all stu-
dents; 
Whereas school counselors help develop 
well-rounded students by guiding students 
through academic learning, social and emo-
tional development, and career exploration; 
Whereas personal and social growth can 
help lead to increased academic achieve-
ment; 
Whereas school counselors play a vital role 
in ensuring that students are ready for both 
college and careers; 
Whereas school counselors play a vital role 
in making students aware of opportunities 
for financial aid and college scholarships; 
Whereas school counselors assist with and 
coordinate efforts to foster a positive school 
climate, resulting in a safer learning envi-
ronment for all students; 
Whereas school counselors have been in-
strumental in helping students, teachers, 
and parents deal with personal trauma as 
well as tragedies in their communities and 
the United States; 
Whereas students face myriad challenges 
every day, including peer pressure, bullying, 
mental health issues, the deployment of fam-
ily members to serve in conflicts overseas, 
and school violence; 
Whereas a school counselor is one of the 
few professionals in a school building who is 
trained in both education and social and 
emotional development; 
Whereas the roles and responsibilities of 
school counselors are often misunderstood; 
Whereas the school counselor position is 
often among the first to be eliminated to 
meet budgetary constraints; 
Whereas the national average ratio of stu-
dents to school counselors is 430 to 1, almost 
twice the 250 to 1 ratio recommended by the 
American School Counselor Association, the 
National Association for College Admission 
Counseling, and other organizations; and 
Whereas 
the 
celebration 
of 
National 
School Counseling Week will increase aware-
ness of the important and necessary role 
school counselors play in the lives of stu-
dents in the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of February 1 
through 5, 2021, as ‘‘National School Coun-
seling Week’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe National School Coun-
seling Week with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities that promote awareness of the 
role school counselors play in schools and 
the community at large in preparing stu-
dents for fulfilling lives as contributing

Whereas a competitive global economy re-

Whereas 3,000,000 workers will be needed 
for the United States’ infrastructure in the 
next several years, including designing,

economy, creating significant demands for 
high-quality and efficient upskilling and 
reskilling opportunities to ensure a quick 
and equitable recovery; 
Whereas career and technical education 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘CTE’’) en-
sures that competitive and skilled workers 
are ready, willing, and capable of holding 
jobs in high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand 
career fields such as science, technology, en-
gineering, art and design, mathematics, 
nursing, allied health, construction, infor-
mation technology, energy sustainability, 
and many other career fields that are vital 
in keeping the United States competitive in 
the global economy; 
Whereas CTE helps the United States meet 
the very real and immediate challenges of 
economic 
development, 
student 
achieve-
ment, and global competitiveness; 
Whereas the United States has 30,000,000 
jobs providing an average income of $55,000 
per year that do not require a bachelor’s de-
gree yet increasingly require some level of 
postsecondary education; 
Whereas over 12,800,000 students are en-
rolled in CTE across the country at the sec-
ondary and postsecondary levels, with CTE 
programs in thousands of CTE centers, com-
prehensive high schools, career academies, 
and CTE high schools, and nearly 1,000 2-year 
colleges; 
Whereas CTE matches employability skills 
with workforce demand and provides rel-
evant academic and technical coursework 
leading to industry-recognized credentials 
for secondary, postsecondary, and adult 
learners; 
Whereas CTE affords students the oppor-
tunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and cre-
dentials needed to secure careers in growing, 
high-demand fields; 
Whereas secondary CTE is associated with 
a lower probability of dropping out of high 
school and a higher likelihood of graduating 
on-time; 
Whereas according to an American Federa-
tion of Teachers poll, 94 percent of parents 
approve of expanding access to CTE and 
other programs that prepare students for 
jobs; 
Whereas students at schools with highly 
integrated rigorous academic and CTE pro-
grams are significantly more likely to meet 
college and career readiness benchmarks 
than students at schools with less integrated 
programs; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress affirmed the im-
portance of CTE by passing the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education for 
the 21st Century Act (Public Law 115–224), 
which supports program improvement in sec-
ondary and postsecondary CTE programs in 
all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puer-
to Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, 
and outlying areas; and 
Whereas, February 23, 2019, marked the 
102nd anniversary of the signing of the Act of 
February 23, 1917 (39 Stat. 929, commonly 
known as the ‘‘Smith-Hughes Vocational 
Education Act of 1917’’), which was the first 
major Federal investment in secondary CTE 
and laid the foundation for the bipartisan, 
bicameral support for CTE that continues as 
of February 2021: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of February 
2021 as ‘‘Career and Technical Education 
Month’’ to celebrate career and technical 
education across the United States; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Career 
and Technical Education Month; 
(3) recognizes the importance of career and 
technical education in preparing a well-edu-
cated and skilled workforce in the United 
States; and 
(4) encourages educators, school coun-
selors, guidance and career development pro-
fessionals, administrators, and parents to 
promote career and technical education as a 
respected option for students. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, by sup-
porting the development of a workforce 
trained in in-demand skills, we can ac-
celerate the recovery of our economy. 
The Nation’s continued progress and 
the socioeconomic mobility of our citi-
zens are contingent on the education 
and skills of the American workforce 
and its ability to adjust to and fulfill 
the needs of the 21st century econ-
omy—especially in the wake of the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Career 
and 
technical education (CTE) programs 
are vital to every student’s education, 
providing them access to the important 
knowledge, 
skills, 
and 
credentials 
needed to obtain careers in rapidly 
growing, 
high-demand 
industries. 
Today, approximately 12.8 million stu-
dents across the Nation are enrolled in 
CTE programs offered by thousands of 
career academies, comprehensive high 
schools, CTE high schools, community 
colleges, and CTE centers. Through ap-
plied learning, these students obtain 
workplace skills and technical training 
that mirror in-demand positions in the 
workforce. 
In the next decade, millions of 
skilled workers will be needed to fill 
infrastructure positions in the United 
States, including jobs related to de-
signing, building, and operating trans-
portation, 
housing, 
telecommuni-
cation, and utilities facilities. CTE 
programs intentionally match skills 
with workforce demands, lowering the 
probability of high school drop-out and 
increasing the likelihood of on time 
graduation rates. These CTE programs 
will help fill the estimated 30 million 
U.S. jobs available with an average an-
nual income of $55,000 that do not re-
quire a bachelor’s degree yet neces-
sitate some level of postsecondary edu-
cation. 
Across Virginia, I hear about an in-
crease in workforce needs from front-
line health services to manufacturing 
PPE to contract tracing—the list goes 
on. As we see a surge in unemployment 
overall from the pandemic, it is essen-
tial that we highlight the important 
role of CTE in the country’s ability to 
meet the challenges we face in eco-
nomic recovery and development, stu-
dent achievement, and global competi-
tiveness. In 2018, Congress affirmed the 
importance of CTE by passing the 
Strengthening Career and Technical 
Education for the 21st Century Act 
which supports CTE programs in sec-
ondary and postsecondary education. 
We also need to ensure we continue 
reskilling and upskilling workers by 
supporting workforce development pro-
grams. 
Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus 
co-chairs Senator PORTMAN, Senator 
BALDWIN, and Senator YOUNG and more 
than half of my colleagues in the Sen-
ate, I am pleased to again introduce a 
bipartisan resolution to designate Feb-
ruary as Career and Technical Edu-
cation (CTE) month. CTE Month en-
courages students, parents, counselors, 
educators, and school leaders to learn 
more about the diverse educational op-
portunities offered in their commu-
nities, and recognize the valuable role 
of CTE in developing a well-educated 
and highly skilled workforce in the 
United States. 
By formally recognizing CTE Month 
through this resolution, we hope to 
bring greater awareness to improving 
access to high-quality career and tech-
nical education for millions of Amer-
ica’s students and our nation’s ongoing 
economic competitiveness.

Whereas National Speech and Debate Edu-
cation Day acknowledges that most achieve-

pivotal moments in modern history begin, 
end, or are crystallized with public address; 
Whereas National Speech and Debate Edu-

March 3, 2021 
CELEBRATING THE SERVICE OF 
READING CLERK JOE NOVOTNY 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the outstanding service of the Reading 
Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, Joe Novotny, as he prepares for 
his retirement. As Reading Clerk, Joe Novotny 
has served as the ‘Voice of the House,’ and 
his trusted leadership and valued presence on 
the House Floor will be missed by Members 
and staff on both sides of the aisle. 
Joe Novotny has dedicated his entire career 
to the People’s House. A Chicago native, 
Novotny came to Washington to serve as a 
Congressional page at age 16. After studying 
Political Communication at George Wash-
ington University, he returned to the House, 
where he worked as a staffer for the House 
Education and Labor Committee for fifteen 
years, rising to become Chief Clerk for this es-
sential committee. His service was greatly re-
spected by all, including by Education and 
Labor Chair George Miller, who lauded 
Novotny as ‘an incredibly valuable asset to my 
staff [whose] unparalleled integrity and dedica-
tion helped our committee advance major poli-
cies that are making a difference in the lives 
of working families.’ 
In 2010, it was my great and proud honor 
as Speaker of the House to name Joe 
Novotny Reading Clerk: the first openly gay 
man to hold this important position. His his-
toric service has made our Congress more in-
clusive, diverse and representative of the peo-
ple whom we serve. As Novotny stated upon 
his appointment, ‘When you think about the di-
versity in this House now—and the fact that 
we have the first woman Speaker and we 
have the first African-American Clerk of the 
House—this is a Congress of firsts, so to be 
a part of that is a tremendous honor.’ As the 
child of immigrants, Novotny’s ascendance to 
service in the halls of the United States Cap-
itol is, as he has proudly said, the story of the 
American Dream. 
As Reading Clerk, Novotny has been vital in 
engaging and connecting our country with 
their Democracy, as he ensures that legisla-
tive measures debated in the House are clear-
ly articulated not only to Members of Congress 
but to the American people and to commu-
nities around the world. He has consistently 
brought his steady, calming presence and 
great professionalism and institutional exper-
tise to the House Floor, and in doing so, has 
helped advance the ability of the People’s 
House to do the people’s work. 
His commitment to making the Congress 
more open, accessible and efficient has been 
particularly important to the functioning of the 
House and the health of our Democracy dur-
ing the challenging time of the coronavirus 
pandemic, as our institution has adjusted to 
remote and virtual operations. 
While Joe Novotny’s service will be missed, 
his great love for the House and his dedication 
to our Democracy stand as an inspiration for 
all who will follow in the path that he has 
blazed. On behalf of the United States House 
of Representatives, I thank Joe Novotny for 
his patriotic service, which has strengthened 
the Congress and Country.

CHESTER 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize three young women from Vir-
ginia’s 10th Congressional District who made 
history as the first female Eagle Scouts in the 
Shenandoah Area Council. Eagle Scout is the 
highest achievement or rank to earn in Scouts 
BSA, 
and 
Lauren 
Reed, 
Amelia 
‘‘Mia’’ 
Lunceford, and Elaina Truban of Winchester 
have all exemplified the remarkable leader-
ship, talent, and perseverance to earn this dis-
tinction. 
To achieve the Eagle title, scouts are re-
quired to earn 21 merit badges, complete and 
lead a service project that benefits their com-
munity and sit before the Eagle Scout Board 
of Review. For their thoughtful community 
projects, Lauren planted shrubbery and land-
scaping around a flag pole at Locust Grove 
Cemetery in Stephens City, Mia worked on a 
wildflower rain garden at Izaak Walton Lake in 
Frederick County, and Elaina made a raised 
flower bed and planted seven trees on the 
grounds of her church. Until recently, girls and 
young women were not allowed to join the 
program. Now, there are 83 female scouts in 
five different troops in the Shenandoah Area 
Council. All three of the first class of female 
Eagle Scouts in the Shenandoah Area Council 
are members of Troop 2G of Winchester. 
These young women were honored and rec-
ognized in Winchester, Virginia on January 26, 
2021. All three are following in the footsteps of 
their male siblings and other family members 
who attained the same recognition. Lauren, 
Mia, and Elaina now help pave the way for fu-
ture female scouts to pursue the ranks of 
Eagle Scout, and they are just beginning their 
journeys as impactful community members 
and strong, female leaders.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 447 NATIONAL 
APPRENTICESHIP ACT OF 2021 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and as a cosponsor, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 
2021, which invests more than $3.5 billion 
over 5 years in expanding opportunities and 
access to Registered Apprenticeships, youth 
apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeships. 
I thank Congressman SCOTT, the Chairman 
of the Education and Labor Committee, for re-
introducing this legislation which passed by a 
substantial margin in the 116th Congress as 
H.R. 8294. 
This important legislation has the potential 
to yield $10.6 billion in net benefits to U.S. 
taxpayers in the form of increased workers 
productivity and decreased spending on pub-
lic-assistance programs and unemployment in-
surance and which bring America’s invest-
ments in apprenticeship more in line with 
countries around the world. 
Madam Speaker, the Registered Apprentice-
ship (RAs) system is America’s most success-
ful federally authorized workforce development 
program. 
According to the Department of Labor, 94 
percent of people who complete RAs are em-
ployed upon completion, earning an average 
starting wage of above $70,000 annually. 
Yet, according to the most recent data, only 
0.3 percent of the overall workforce in America 
have completed an apprenticeship. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation could not 
be more timely because during a time of 
record unemployment, the National Appren-
ticeship Act of 2021 invests more than $3.5 
billion over 5 years in expanding opportunities 
and access to Registered Apprenticeships, 
youth apprenticeships, and pre-apprentice-
ships. 
The legislation also creates an additional 1 
million new apprenticeship opportunities on 
top of the current expected growth of the ap-
prenticeship system, an investment that not 
only will pay off for workers and employers, 
but also benefit the taxpayers. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation is critical to 
expanding the nation’s workforce development 
system during our country’s deepest economic 
downturn since the Great Depression. 
Specifically, the National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2021 authorizes $400 million for fiscal year 
(FY) 2022, increasing by $100 million annually 
to $800 million for FY 2026, to support the 
creation or expansion of registered apprentice-
ships, youth apprenticeships and pre-appren-
ticeship programs, including in non-traditional 
apprenticeship occupations and for nontradi-
tional populations. 
This funding will also attract and encourage 
employer participation and recruitment for indi-
viduals with barriers to employment, including 
individuals impacted by the criminal justice 
system. 
Additionally, to ensure that apprenticeship 
agreements and program registration to en-
sure consistency in quality standards and 
worker protections, H.R. 447 codifies and 
streamlines standards for registered appren-
ticeships, youth apprenticeship and pre-ap-
prenticeship programs.

Also codified are the existing regulations 
and practices to ensure that all individuals 
have an equal opportunity to participate in pro-
grams under the national apprenticeship sys-
tem, and to increase diversity in the occupa-
tions offered and the individuals participating 
in programs, especially in high-skill, high- 
wage, and in-demand industry sectors and oc-
cupations. 
The legislation institutionalizes, and estab-
lishes by statute, the Department of Labor’s 
(DOL) Office of Apprenticeship, and vests it 
with the following roles and responsibilities: 
Increasing participation in programs under 
the national apprenticeship system through 
technical assistance and program recognition 
activities; 
Bringing together industry sector leaders 
and experts, including employers, industry as-
sociations, joint labor-management organiza-
tions, labor organizations, education and train-
ing providers, credential providers, and ap-
prentices to establish national frameworks to 
expand apprenticeships to new occupations 
and sectors; and 
Improving data infrastructure to improve re-
porting and publicly disseminating information 
about apprenticeship programs. 
Another strong feature of this legislation is 
that it codifies the roles and responsibilities of 
the State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs) by: 
Authorizing annual funding for State Appren-
ticeship Offices and SAAs at $75 million for 
fiscal year (FY) 2022, increasing by $10 mil-
lion annually to reach $115 million for FY 
2026, with one-third of funds equally distrib-
uted to all States and outlying areas, and two- 
thirds of funds distributed via formula to SAAs; 
and 
Requiring SAAs to submit plans for reg-
istered apprenticeship activities, which gen-
erally mirror existing state requirements under 
the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
and the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical 
Education Act. 
My concluding reason for supporting this im-
portant legislation is that it strengthens the 
connections between the Department of Edu-
cation and Department of Labor through an 
interagency agreement to support the creation 
and expansion of youth apprenticeships, col-
lege consortiums, and data sharing agree-
ments. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage. 
APPRENTICESHIP SUCCESS STORIES 
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM 
The Houston Community College (HCC) 
Apprenticeship Program is a partnership be-
tween HCC and 11 U.S. Department of Labor 
approved Apprenticeship programs in Hous-
ton. The program provides a 3–5 year job 
training system for skilled trade and craft 
workers. 
Employers, employer associations, and 
joint-labor 
management 
organizations 
known collectively as apprenticeship spon-
sors provide apprentices with on-the-job in-
struction that reflects industry needs, while 
HCC provides the classroom-related instruc-
tion. HCC apprentices can study in eight dif-
ferent disciplines including: carpenters, elec-
tricians, millwrights, pipe-fitters, welders, 
masons, stationary engineers, and glaziers. 
In 2013, HCC launched a 35-million renova-
tion project of the San Jacinto building on 
its Central campus with HCC apprentices 
contributing to the massive renovation and 
restoration project. 
Ten HCC plumber and pipefitter appren-
tices helped upgrade the building’s pool, bas-
ketball gymnasium, laid pipes and rede-
signed Memorial Green. 
HCC apprenticeship program prides itself 
on 
the 
rapid 
development 
and 
profes-
sionalism of its students. Thus far, HCC ap-
prentices can boast a zero OSHA injuries and 
a 24% increase in productivity and 43% de-
crease in job turnover. 
‘‘The quality of the work on this project 
will provide lower maintenance and oper-
ating cost for Houston Community College 
and is referred to as Life Cycle Engineering 
Cost. This project provides a win-win oppor-
tunity for Houston Community College and 
their students,’’ said Apprenticeship Direc-
tor, Doug Posey. 
When the San Jacinto project is complete, 
it will become an academic center for Cen-
tral College. The project is scheduled to be 
completed by the end of 2013. 
JOHN SOILEAU’S STORY 
John Soileau knows his way around a 
plumbing system. He’s spent the last 5-years 
learning to install and repair commercial 
and residential plumbing systems, as well as 
designing new systems, laying or fitting 
pipes and repairing and maintaining appli-
ances 
in 
Houston 
Community 
College’s 
(HCC) apprenticeship program. 
‘‘I’ve learned so much over the five year 
period. From math basic, AutoCAD, shop 
classes to welding and learning how to pipe 
a dollhouse,’’ said Soileau. 
Unlike many college students, Soileau got 
paid to go to school. The 3–5 year apprentice-
ship program mixes paid on-the-job training 
with classroom instruction allowing the stu-
dent to earn as they learn. 
‘‘This program gave me the opportunity to 
make a living and eliminate any doubts I 
had about how I was going to pay my tui-
tion. It was a win/win situation for me.’’ 
As Soileau nears the end of the apprentice-
ship program, he is looking forward to start-
ing his career as a Master Plumber and with 
a five-year work history; he says he is con-
fident about his training and his future. 
HCC APPRENTICE STUDENTS HELP BUILD NEW 
HOSPITAL 
Eleven Houston Community College (HCC) 
and 
Independent 
Electrical 
Contractors 
(IEC) apprentice students broke ground on 
the 
Jeanie 
Sealy 
Hospital 
construction 
project in Galveston, Texas in September 
2012. In collaboration with numerous con-
tracted workers, HCC students are proving 
on a daily basis that their apprentice train-
ing is valuable to the project. 
‘‘The project is an example of the quality 
of electricians being trained at their appren-
tice school. The old time skills of electrical 
workers simply are no longer sufficient to 
meet the demands of modern day technology 
in accomplishing the work,’’ said Eddie 
Rodriquez, 
Director 
of 
IEC 
Apprentice 
School. 
The total project was design by computer 
aided drafting or AutoCAD with prefabrica-
tion of all conduits including the smaller 3⁄4′′ 
size conduit at their fabrication shop and 
shipped to the job site for installation. The 
complexity of this project has construction 
veterans in awe of the students’ knowledge 
and success. 
‘‘I was totally impressed with the com-
plexity and quality of the conduit installa-
tion in such a complex and compact facility 
as a modern hospital requires,’’ said Doug 
Posey, HCC Director of Apprenticeship Pro-
grams. 
Apprentice workers training has been rec-
ognized in providing increased productivity 
by 24%, worker turnover down by 43%, job 
site absenteeism down by 59%, Occupational 
Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) re-
cordable injuries down by 67%, and first aid 
cases down by 90%. 
‘‘IEC continues to modernize their training 
methods and the technology needed to sat-
isfy the contractor’s needs to stay produc-
tive and competitive in today’s market 
place,’’ said Rodriquez. 
The Jeanie Sealy Hospital project contract 
is valued at $27.4 million. The project is 
scheduled to conclude August 2015.

HONORING EDGAR KING FOR HIS 
LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO SARA-
TOGA 
COUNTY, 
NEW 
YORK 
DAIRY FARMERS, AND THE EN-
TIRE NORTH COUNTRY REGION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Edgar ‘‘Ed’’ King for his lifetime 
dedication to public service for the betterment 
of Saratoga County and New York State’s 
Dairy industry. 
Born a Saratogian with deep family roots in 
dairy farming, Ed made improving New York’s 
agricultural industry his life’s work at the local, 
state, and national level. A lifelong farmer and 
graduate of the prestigious Cornell University 
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Ed 
went on to serve as the Deputy Commissioner 
of New York State’s Department of Agriculture 
and Markets from 1976 to 1987. When Ed re-
turned from Albany, he immersed himself in 
local politics, and was elected Supervisor for 
Northumberland on the Saratoga County 
Board of Supervisors in 1992. He held that po-
sition until 2004, following in his father’s foot-
steps who held the same seat after being 
elected in 1944. Ed also spent time serving on 
the boards of Dairy Management, Inc., the Na-
tional Dairy Board, and the New England 
Dairy Promotion Board. 
After retiring from his exemplary career in 
public service, Ed continued to be heavily in-
volved in the day to day operation of Kings 
Ransom Farm in Schuylerville. This fifth-gen-
eration, family-run farm is one of the largest 
dairy farms in the region, established in 1901 
by King’s grandfather. Ed continued doing 
what he loved, interacting with and serving his 
community, as he and his wife, Carolyn, oper-
ated a bed and breakfast on the farm where 
they 
eagerly 
welcomed 
visitors, 
tourists, 
strangers, and friends. Ed was especially 
proud to watch as his sons very successfully 
expanded the business to add King Brothers 
Dairy, a dairy store that offers home delivery 
service. My heartfelt condolences go out to his 
wife, their four sons, and his extended family. 
Ed was an extraordinary leader for Saratoga 
County, the dairy industry and beyond. He 
was tireless in his efforts to promote agricul-
tural development throughout New York State. 
His welcoming demeanor, selfless service, 
and deep respect for everyone he encoun-
tered is a shining example for us all. Ed was 
an integral part of the community and will be 
greatly missed. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
Congressional District, I am honored to recog-
nize his remarkable leadership and life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF VERNON E. JORDAN, JR. 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of the distin-
guished civil rights leader and my dear friend, 
Mr. Vernon E. Jordan, Jr. For decades, Mr. 
Jordan pursued public service as a lawyer, 
presidential advisor, and civil rights advocate. 
We have lost a prominent figure of the Amer-
ican civil rights movement, a tremendous lead-
er, and a dear friend. 
Mr. Jordan dedicated his life to social justice 
and civil rights activism. Born on August 15, 
1935, he grew up in the segregated South and 
graduated from DePauw University in Indiana 
in 1957, where he was the only African Amer-
ican in his class. Jordan then attended How-
ard University School of Law, where he began 
his legal career working in the civil rights 
movement. In 1961, he joined the firm of Don-
ald Hollowell and won a lawsuit against the 
University of Georgia on behalf of the first two 
Black students to attend the University. 
Throughout his lifetime of social justice ac-
tivism, he assumed leadership positions to im-
prove the lives of those around him. Mr. Jor-
dan served as field secretary for the Georgia 
chapter of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP), direc-
tor of the Voter Education Project for the 
Southern Regional Council (SRC), and head 
of the United Negro College Fund. Later in 
1971, he was appointed president of the Na-
tional Urban League. 
Upon his recovery from an assassination at-
tempt on his life in 1980, Jordan stepped 
down from the Urban League and took a posi-
tion as legal counsel for the Washington, D.C. 
firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer, and Feld. 
While there, he represented many prominent 
clients, including Arkansas Governor Bill Clin-
ton. In 1992, Mr. Jordan was chosen by Presi-
dent-elect Clinton to lead his transition team 
and then served as his advisor. He was the 
first Black person to be assigned such a role. 
Jordan knew what it meant to serve his 
community and our nation. His dedication for 
civil rights and ability to move society toward 
justice will always leave a mark in history. Mr. 
Jordan dedicated his life to transforming soci-
ety and his hard work will always be remem-
bered. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest con-
dolences to Vernon’s wife, Ann; his daughter, 
Vickee; and his entire family during this ex-
tremely difficult time. His life and legacy will al-
ways live on and he will be dearly missed. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
express my strong opposition to H.R. 1 and 
my great disappointment that the Majority re-
fused to allow my commonsense amendments 
to be offered to this bill. This bill was written 
behind closed doors and though Members of 
Congress offered over 180 amendments to im-
prove this bill only 56 were allowed to be of-
fered on the House floor. That is a travesty for 
Congress and the American people who want 
and deserve honest and transparent elections. 
This bill bans voter identification laws and 
mandates States implement mail-in voting 
both of which will lead to massive election 
fraud. Even European countries have rejected 
these failed policies due to fraud. 
While serving in the Florida Senate I was 
tasked with reforming Florida’s election laws 
following the 2000 election and chaos that en-
sued. Having tackled election reform in the 
aftermath of an uncertain election, I know first-
hand how important it is to restore confidence 
and eliminate existing grey areas that may 
lead to fraud or raise questions about fairness. 
Events surrounding the 2020 election raised 
questions from my constituents about the op-
eration and certification of voting machines 
used throughout our state and the nation. 
Chief among those concerns was whether our 
voting machines are connected to the internet 
and vulnerable to manipulation through hack-
ing. To answer these and other questions I 
contacted the U.S. Election Assistance Com-
mission which certifies voting hardware and 
software for use in our elections. 
In her letter to me, the Inspector General of 
the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ad-
dressed this topic stating that the ‘‘EAC be-
lieves Michigan may use modem transmission 
features in at least some of its Dominion vot-
ing systems.’’ This is in direct conflict with as-
sertions by the maker of the Dominion Voting 
System who stated, ‘‘. . . Voting systems are 
by design meant to be used as closed sys-
tems that are not networked meaning they are 
not connected to the Internet.’’ 
To end the confusion on this issue and re-
store confidence in our system, I filed an 
amendment that would prohibit voting systems 
from being connected to the Internet; specifi-
cally, stating that no system or device upon 
which ballots are programmed or votes are 
cast or tabulated shall be connected to the 
Internet at any time. That would ensure the in-
tegrity of voting machines. Unfortunately, that 
amendment was not allowed to be debated 
and voted on. 
My second amendment would ensure that 
election machines are fully auditable—no 
longer would election officials and election 
equipment providers deny full audits of elec-
tions due to proprietary software or hardware. 
The American people have a right to a full 
audit of any election to ensure the full integrity 
of elections. There is no good reason to op-
pose this amendment but, again, it was not al-
lowed to be debated and voted on. 
And, my third amendment would have pro-
hibited the use of voting systems produced by 
a foreign entity. It would also require all com-
ponents of the voting systems be manufac-
tured and maintained in the United States. 
Why should the votes of the American people 
be subject to counting using foreign equipment 
that cannot be audited and that may be con-
nected to the Internet? My amendments would 
ban all three of these things. 
By denying elected Members of Congress a 
vote on these amendments, Speaker PELOSI 
decided against providing full transparency 
and accountability in our federal elections. 
This partisan bill should be rejected.

EXPRESSING 
CONDOLENCES 
AND 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR. 
IRBY B. HUNTER, SR. 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Irby 
Hunter, Sr., who transitioned on February 24, 
2021. It is with sorrow that I mourn his pass-
ing, but with great joy that I remember his rich 
legacy. 
Dr. Hunter was born in Lindale, Texas on 
July 12, 1940 to Oliver and Malissa Hunter, 
the fourth of six children. He excelled in 
school and went on to earn a Bachelor of 
Science in Chemistry from Texas College and 
a Master of Science in Chemistry from 
Tuskegee Institute in 1963. Thereafter, he 
continued his education at the The University 
of Texas Health Science Center at Houston 
School of Dentistry, where he earned his doc-
torate degree in dental surgery as only the 
second African American to earn a degree 
from this institution. 
Dr. Hunter launched his dental practice in 
Dallas, dedicating his career to consistently fo-
cusing on the health and healing of his pa-
tients. Throughout his robust career, he 
served as the President and Chairman of the 
Board of the Gulf State Dental Association for 
three terms. Other noteworthy leadership roles 
included President and Chairman of the M.C. 
Cooper Dental Society, and affiliation with the 
Dallas County Dental Society, the Texas Den-
tal Association, and the American Dental As-
sociation. Along with his impressive career, 
Dr. Hunter was consistently engaged with his 
community, serving on the founding Board of 
Directors of the Sunbelt National Bank. Fur-
thermore, he was President, Ball Chair, and 
Chaplain of the Cotillion Idlewild Club; a loyal 
donor to the YMCA Mooreland Branch; and a 
regular volunteer at several Dallas area 
schools. He remained closely affiliated with is 
alma mater, Texas College, serving on the 
Trustee Board of Directors and regularly at-
tending a host of Texas College events. 
Known for his approachable and kind de-
meanor, Dr. Hunter was a loving husband of 
58 years, dedicated father of two, and re-
spected community member. Beyond his pas-
sion for his career and community, he will be 
remembered for encouraging the young peo-
ple in his life to dedicate themselves to their 
studies as they pay it forward. 
Dr. Hunter is preceded in death by his par-
ents, brother, Dr. Oliver Hunter, Jr, and sis-
ters, Ruth Byrdsong, Faye Stull, and Rosalind 
McClellan. He leaves behind his devoted wife, 
Staphalene; daughter, Constance Hunter Wil-
son; son, Dr. Irby Hunter, Jr.; sister, Nancy

RECOGNIZING BRIGADIER 
GENERAL JONATHAN C. MOYER 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor U.S. Army Brigadier General Jonathan 
C. Moyer. A beloved son of Burlington County, 
Jonathan C. Moyer was recently promoted to 
Brigadier General and took command of the 
335th Theater Signal Command. I, and the 
town of Pemberton, cannot be prouder of him. 
Brigadier General Jonathan C. Moyer’s pro-
motion is much deserved. He has served his 
country in the armed forces for over two dec-
ades and has been awarded a Bronze Star 
Medal, and numerous citations of the Meri-
torious Service Medal and Army Commenda-
tion Medal for his service. In addition, Briga-
dier General Moyer is dedicated to community 
service and uplifting veterans and students. 
Brigadier General Moyer is a co-founder of 
Tip of the Arrow Foundation, a not-for-profit 
organization that assists mobilized National 
Guard and Reserve Veterans returning from 
military service overseas to translate their mili-
tary skillset to find gainful civilian employment. 
Brigadier General Moyer also served as Direc-
tor of Coaching for Tip of the Arrow Founda-
tion, where he managed 30 volunteer coaches 
to assist our Veterans with resume writing, job 
interviews, and salary negotiation. Additionally, 
Moyer has been involved with several organi-
zations from AFCEA, AOC, to AUSA, serving 
as a senior mentor for local high schools and 
colleges STEM programs. 
I commend Brigadier General Jonathan C. 
Moyer for his work, and I know I speak on be-
half of my constituents when I say congratula-
tions.

CELEBRATING 
WWII 
VETERAN 
KENNETH 
COOPER’S 
100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th birthday of WWII Vet-
eran Kenneth Conrad Cooper, who served in 
the United States Navy from 1942 to 1981. 
After a full military career, Navy Captain Coo-
per retired as an Air Wing Commander. 
Born March 12, 1921, to Clarence and Ruby 
Cooper, Ken was raised in Pomona, the west-
ern anchor of California’s citrus-growing region 
known as the ‘‘Queen of the Citrus Belt.’’ 
Ken was part of the Orange Empire legacy, 
having been born and raised on a citrus 
ranch. He grew up working in the groves and 
well remembers the sweet scent of citrus blos-
soms and the sooty smoke of the smudge 
pots that were lit to save the orange trees 
from frost. 
With a mother who was a public school 
teacher, and later a principal, Ken was a good 
student who followed in his mother’s footsteps 
to become a lifelong educator. 
Ken remained in the Pomona area to attend 
Chaffee and La Verne colleges. While in col-
lege his love of flying took wing and he earned 
his pilot’s license and became an instructor. 
Then WWII happened. 
With his civilian flight instructor background 
and the urgency of the war at hand, he joined 
the United States Navy and immediately 
began training young pilots. A short time after 
his entrance into the service, he began flying 
the large DC–6 and DC–7 transport planes. 
It was during these tumultuous times that he 
met a Navy nurse, Shirley, who became his 
wife. At the end of the war, he and Shirley set-
tled back in the Orange Empire. 
Ken became an elementary school teacher. 
During his many years in education, he ad-
vanced from classroom teacher to principal of 
both elementary and junior high schools. At 
the end of his career, he was assistant super-
intendent of the same school district he at-
tended as a child. 
These were busy years for Ken. Along with 
raising a family of three children with Shirley, 
while moving up the ladder in education, he 
also was chairman of the Pomona Planning 
Commission, president of the local Kiwanis 
Club, and president of the Pomona Teachers 
Association. 
He maintained his passion for flying by par-
ticipating as a Navy Reserves ‘‘weekend war-
rior.’’ While doing all of this, he earned a Mas-
ter’s degree at Pomona College and attended 
the Naval War College, thereby continuing his 
military advancement. 
In retirement, his drive did not diminish. He 
and Shirley maintained additional homes in 
both Mexico and Palm Springs, where he pur-
sued his passion for golf. It was also during 
this time that he and his wife did a great deal 
of traveling, mostly on cruises. This wander-
lust took them all over the world, from Asia, 
Alaska, Europe, South and North America, 
and the Caribbean, to name a few. 
Later they moved to Walnut Village in Ana-
heim, where Ken participates in veterans cele-
brations in full uniform. 
Please rise with me to salute this good man 
who has devoted his life to family, community 
and country. Happy 100th with many more 
birthdays to come.

REMEMBERING EMILIA MARIA 
PLACANICA 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Emilia Maria Placanica, of 
Warren, Ohio, who passed away peacefully on 
Sunday, February 21, 2021 at the age of 83. 
Emilia was born on May 8, 1937 in 
Caulonia, Regio Calabria, Italy, daughter of 
Ilario and Rosa. 
Emilia 
married 
the 
love 
of 
her 
life, 
Francesco Carmelo ‘‘Frank’’ Placanica on Oc-
tober 13, 1957. They shared 52 years of mar-
riage together until Frank’s passing in 2010. 
Prior to coming to the United States in 
1960, Emilia graduated and held a degree as 
a tailor for men and women’s garments. She 
retired after a 30-plus year career working in 
various department stores. 
Mrs. Placanica enjoyed sewing, cooking, 
knitting, crocheting, making ceramics, reading, 
being with friends and family, however, she 
most enjoyed and loved babysitting her grand-
children. Emilia was a God-fearing woman and 
greatly enjoyed reading prayers in Italian. 
Emilia will be dearly missed by her children, 
Anna Maria Placanica of Washington, D.C., 
Sandra 
‘‘Sandy’’ 
Placanica—Frazeskos 
of 
Warren, Renee Placanica of Warren, and An-
tonio F ‘‘Tony’ Placanica of Liberty, and grand-
children, Francesca, Isabella and Georgio 
Frazeskos, Francesco McElrath, Adrianna, 
Olivia and triplets, Antonio, Francesco and 
Dominico Placanica. In New York, Emilia 
leaves her niece, Rosa Placanica, along with 
her children (great-niece/nephew) Angelica 
Blazina-Mantovani 
and 
family 
and 
Fabio 
Blazina. Additionally, Emilia leaves many fam-
ily members abroad to include sister-in-law 
Rosa (Australia), as well many nieces, neph-
ews, great-niece and nephews, cousins in Italy 
and Australia. 
Emilia was preceded in death by her par-
ents; her husband, Frank; daughter, Angelina 
Placanica; two brothers and three sisters. 
My family and I are proud to be friends with 
Emilia’s daughter, Sandy, and her grandson, 
Georgio. My deepest condolences go out to 
the Placanica Family and to all whose lives 
Emilia touched.

HONORING UNITED STATES AIR 
FORCE COLONEL LARRY H. SHAW 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor United States Air Force Colo-
nel Larry H. Shaw on his highly decorated, 33- 
year career serving our nation, and to con-
gratulate him on his retirement as commander 
of the 434th Air Refueling Wing, Grissom Air 
Reserve Base in Miami County, Indiana. 
Colonel Shaw began his military career in 
1988 after earning his commission from Re-
serve Officer Training School at the University 
of Nebraska, where he graduated with a Bach-
elor of Science in Criminal Justice. He went 
on to accumulate more than 5,700 flight hours 
and deployed overseas for multiple operations. 
Colonel Shaw’s years of leadership, pilot train-
ing, and mission development have ensured 
the nearly 1,900 military, civilian, and con-
tractor personnel at Grissom have what they 
need to support the United States Air Force 
mission and defend our country. 
Grissom Air Reserve Base is a source of 
pride for Hoosiers in our community. It is the 
largest employer in Miami County, and it is 
home to the largest KC–135R Stratotanker 
unit in the Air Force Reserve Command. Since 
Colonel Shaw became commander in 2016, I 
have seen firsthand the positive impact of his 
dedication and commitment to excellence. I 
want to thank him for his outstanding initiative 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. He has

gone above and beyond to ensure the brave 
men and women under his command remain 
safe and healthy. In addition, his innovative 
thinking has brought numerous economic de-
velopment opportunities to northern Indiana, 
strengthening the communities surrounding 
Grissom Air Reserve Base. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Colonel Shaw’s accomplish-
ments through more than three decades of 
service in the United States Air Force and Air 
Force Reserve. On behalf of 2nd District Hoo-
siers, I am grateful for the incredible legacy he 
will leave behind, and I wish him all the best 
in the years to come.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act I am 
proud to have co-introduced, which includes 
my amendment to further facilitate voting by 
all eligible Americans through the best-prac-
tices expansion of vote-by-mail elections. 
Our For the People Act is a truly revolu-
tionary bill that will implement many of the 
most critical government reform efforts we 
need to get government working for the peo-
ple again, such as fighting voter suppression, 
simplifying voting, promoting election security, 
curbing special interest and dark money in 
politics, incentivizing smaller and broader do-
nations, increasing transparency and fortifying 
ethics laws. 
While I applaud the efforts and amendments 
of my colleagues that incorporate lessons 
learned in this past election, like ensuring 
Americans with disabilities have access to vot-
ing and verification infrastructure, I believe 
more can and must be done to analyze the 
greatest possible utilization of mail-in voting 
throughout our nation. My amendment, which 
has been accepted by the House and added 
to the bill, is needed because we should know 
what went well and what needs improvement 
as we look to responsibly expand voter access 
by mail. 
Heading into the 2020 election, five states— 
Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Utah and my 
Hawaii—held universal vote-by-mail elections, 
with no-excuse absentee voting being an op-
tion in 34 states and the District of Columbia. 
The growing concerns over the safety of in- 
person voting during the COVID–19 pandemic 
prompted an additional 11 states to make it 
easier to vote by mail using absentee ballots. 
The prevalence and easy access to vote-by- 
mail led, in part, to record voter turnout in the 
last election. Roughly two-thirds of eligible vot-
ers cast a record 158.4 million ballots, with 
nearly 65 million ballots cast using the mail. 
This is a dramatic increase from the 2016 
elections, where roughly 34 million Americans 
cast a ballot by mail. 
In my Hawaii, which performed its first uni-
versal vote-by-mail election in the 2020 pri-
mary elections, vote-by-mail increased election 
accessibility across-the-board, especially for 
our kupuna (elders) and those in underserved 
communities for whom in-person voting is 
problematic, especially during the COVID–19 
pandemic. Hawaii’s most recent primary elec-
tion resulted in the highest voter turnout per-
centage for a primary election in our state’s 
history, and more people voted in Hawaii’s 
general election than ever before. We dem-
onstrated to ourselves and the rest of the 
country that we can hold an all-mail election 
with virtually no fraud claims or disputed elec-
tion results. 
Despite Hawaii’s success, I am sure we can 
do even better, and there are best practices 
that can be shared amongst the states across 
our nation to encourage the even more wide-
spread adoption of vote-by-mail. Thus, my 
amendment simply directs the Election Assist-
ance Commission to conduct a study on vote- 
by-mail efforts in 2020 elections and develop 
recommendations to help states better admin-
ister their elections in the future. My study and 
the recommendations that will come from it 
can help improve vote-by-mail procedures and 
systems to ensure the right to vote to all eligi-
ble Americans while protecting the integrity 
and security of our elections. 
I thank this House for supporting my 
amendment, and urge this body to support 
final passage of the underlying bill. The For 
the People Act will truly deliver on our obliga-
tion to help renew Americans’ faith in govern-
ment by making sure it is of and for the peo-
ple. Mahala (thank you).

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MONROE 
COUNTY 
HISTORICAL 
ASSOCIA-
TION’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to the Monroe County Historical 
Association located in Stroudsburg, Pennsyl-
vania. They are approaching the significant 
benchmark of 100 years of service, which they 
celebrated at their annual meeting on Feb-
ruary 28. 
Formed on April 8, 1921, a group of enthu-
siasts known as the Historical Society were 
given one room in the Stroud Mansion to keep 
records and relics of earlier days. Officially in-
corporated on September 5, 1928, the Histor-
ical Society continued to collect artifacts and 
required more space over the years. 
On March 8, 1990, the Monroe County His-
torical Society merged with the Monroe Coun-
ty Museum Association fanning the present- 
day Monroe County Historical Association. A 
few years later, on May 16, 1994, the Wom-
an’s Club of the Stroudsburgs transferred total 
ownership of the Stroud Mansion to the Mon-
roe County Historical Association. 
They are well known for their stately home, 
the Stroud Mansion, which was built in Geor-
gian-style architecture in 1795 by a prominent 
businessman and has its own unique history. 
It is a prime example of their stewardship and 
is one of three buildings they maintain. The 
stately Mansion houses pieces dating back to 
pre-contact experiences as well as historic 
photographs and articles. I am sure the Mon-
roe County Historical Association will continue 
to document the events of our recent times 
with a sharp awareness of how soon they will 
be our past. 
It is my honor to commend the Monroe 
County Historical Association for their service 
as the official county historical organization for 
Monroe County. The staff and volunteers have 
strived well and hard to preserve Monroe 
County’s rich history. It is my hope they will 
continue this valuable work for many years to 
come.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a statement from Oregon 
Secretary of State Shemia Fagan urging sup-
port for H.R. 1, For the People Act. 
TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1, FOR THE 
PEOPLE ACT—STRENGTHENING AMERICA DE-
MOCRACY HEARING 
(Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan) 
Dear Chairwoman Lofgren, Ranking Mem-
ber Davis and Distinguished Members of the 
Committee: My name is Shemia Fagan, and 
I’m honored to serve as Oregon’s 28th Sec-
retary of State. As Oregon’s chief elections 
officer, I lead the agency responsible for up-
holding our democracy. I am writing in sup-
port of H.R. 1, For the People Act. 
My dad raised my two older brothers and 
me as a single parent in a beautiful part of 
rural Oregon: The Dalles and Dufur. Our 
mother suffered from addiction and was in 
and out of our lives. I remember my brother 
driving us to the Portland area when I was in 
high school to see my mom after she had 
been homeless for several years. We pulled 
up to this large Victorianstyle house, with a 
big wrap around porch and we were blown 
away by this large house. Instead of walking 
up the steps to the front door when she 
greeted us though, my mother dropped to all 
fours and crawled under the porch. She in-
vited us into her home, where a sleeping bag 
covered the dirt. Underneath that porch she 
shared with us one of her few possessions, a 
box of pictures of me and my brothers. A few 
years later she went into recovery and 
fought her addiction. In doing so, she fought 
for herself and our family. In 2014, she passed 
away and I’ll never forget the words of the 
minister at her eulogy, ‘‘Trish reached the

place of an ordinary life, but it didn’t just 
happen to her, she had to fight for it with ev-
erything she had in her.’’ 
Many of us understand the meaning of the 
minister’s words because we have had to 
fight, and are often still fighting, against 
poverty or injustice to reach the place of an 
ordinary life. The ballot is a place to have 
your voice heard on the issues that impact 
you directly. Those fighting against barriers 
to the ballot box need to see progress within 
reach, and I’ve learned that no matter the 
fight: progress must be within reach for ev-
eryone. H.R. 1, the People’s Act is a step to-
ward progress for all eligible Americans. 
I’m fighting every day as Oregon’s Sec-
retary of State to ensure every Oregonian 
has a voice. 
The consideration of H.R. 1 comes at a 
critical moment in America’s history. For 
far too long, too many Americans across the 
country have faced barriers to having their 
voice heard. We should not settle for the sta-
tus quo. We know that free and fair elections 
are a cornerstone of our society, democracy, 
and country—and that they are under threat. 
Hostile foreign governments are trying to 
undermine our democracy and attack our 
democratic institutions. Meanwhile, people 
within our own democratic institutions are 
putting up barriers that impede the funda-
mental right to vote. We must take seriously 
these attempts to undermine the basic prin-
ciples of democracy. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, will help re-
store and bolster voters’ rights. Democracy 
only works when the people can participate 
and have their voice heard. This legislation 
will help to lift the voices of every Amer-
ican, no matter their political party or 
where they live. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, will help re-
store and bolster voters’ rights. Democracy 
only works when the people can participate 
and have their voice heard. This legislation 
will help to lift the voices of every Amer-
ican, no matter their political party or 
where they live. 
H.R. 1 builds upon best practices across the 
country, including many originated in Or-
egon. We are proud to lead by example with 
tried and true policies that have improved 
voter access and participation in the demo-
cratic process for decades. The late Repub-
lican Secretary of State Dennis Richardson 
said, ‘‘Everyone who is eligible to vote 
should be able to vote.’’ Secretary Richard-
son’s words exemplify what we proudly refer 
to as ‘The Oregon Way.’ Together, Orego-
nians across the political spectrum continue 
to work together to reduce barriers to par-
ticipating in our democracy. As Oregon’s 
Secretary of State, I am proud to lend my 
voice to the chorus calling for replicating 
Oregon’s example to other states. 
Vote at Home Act is important legislation 
that was introduced by Representative Earl 
Blumenauer and Senator Ron Wyden and I’m 
proud to support this act and see the critical 
legislation included in H.R. 1. 
Best Practices in Oregon include: 
Vote by Mail 
Automatic Voter Registration 
Online voter registration 
Voting Rights for formerly incarcerated 
individuals 
Secure and convenient drop box locations 
throughout the state 
Early Voting 
Pre-registration of 16 and 17-year-olds 
Voting for individuals with disabilities 
Voting for uniformed services and overseas 
voters 
VOTE BY MAIL/VERIFIED PAPER BALLOTS 
In Oregon, we have a proud tradition of 
open, fair, and accessible elections. This is 
why we were proud to be the first state to 
switch entirely to a vote-by-mail system. 
Voters first approved our vote-by-mail sys-
tem in 1998 and it has long enjoyed bipar-
tisan support. My recent predecessor, Repub-
lican Secretary of State Bev Clarno said in a 
60 Minutes interview that voteby-mail is not 
controversial in Oregon and suggested that if 
other states try it, ‘‘they might like it.’’ 
Thanks to our safe, secure, and modern 
system, Oregon consistently ranks as a na-
tional leader in voter turnout. Voters’ pam-
phlets are sent to every Oregon household 
two to three weeks before an election, giving 
voters time to research issues or candidates. 
Registered voters receive an official ballot to 
complete and insert into an official ballot re-
turn envelope, which is then signed by the 
voter. This ballot return envelope can be 
mailed (postage paid) or dropped off at any 
official drop box across the state. 
Election security is built into Oregon’s 
vote-by-mail system. Each ballot has a 
unique bar code. Election officials in every 
county double check the signature on the 
ballot envelope to ensure it matches the one 
on file. In the 2020 elections, Oregon had a 3– 
step authentication process that allowed for 
computer verification and then two individ-
uals verify the signature on the ballot. Sim-
ply put, paper ballots are the safest method 
for conducting secure and accurate elections. 
Military and overseas ballots are mailed to 
voters at least 45 days before Election day. 
Ballots may be accessed through an on line 
portal called ‘‘My Vote’’ and filled in with 
Oregon’s online ballot-marking tool. Once 
printed, ballots are mailed to the appro-
priate county elections office. A signed bal-
lot may be faxed or emailed if the voter com-
pletes and returns an official Secret Ballot 
Waiver Form. 
AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION 
In 2016, Oregon became the first state to 
implement an automatic voter registration 
(AVR) system. Under the old system, most 
Oregonians needed to take a separate step to 
register to vote at the Department of Motor 
Vehicles (DMV) after obtaining or renewing 
their driver license or ID Card. This law 
makes voter registration automatic, shifting 
from an opt-in process to an opt-out process. 
It eliminates the need to fill out the voter 
registration card for those with qualifying 
interactions at the DMV. Instead, eligible 
Oregonians receive a mailing from the Or-
egon Elections Division explaining their op-
tions for registering to vote. 
The AVR process is limited to applicants 
who have been coded as citizens by DMV. 
The Elections Division sends Oregon Motor 
Voter Cards to those who have provided doc-
umentation that they are U.S. citizens. Or-
egon voters are also required to attest to 
their qualifications—including citizenship— 
at the time they submit their ballot. 
As a result of automatic voter registra-
tion, 92 percent of the eligible voting popu-
lation is registered to vote. Since implemen-
tation in the 2016 election cycle, Oregon saw 
the second largest increase of people of color 
registered at 79 percent, according to Blue 
Lab analysis. A study by political scientist 
and voting expert Professor Paul Gronke of 
Reed College, found that Oregon’s AVR sys-
tem helped register more people of color, 
young people, those who are low income, and 
rural voters. Across the board, Oregon’s AVR 
system has been one of the most successful 
programs in the country to expand access to 
the ballot. 
We already know that this program has 
been instrumental to bringing the vote to 
traditionally disenfranchised populations. As 
just one example: in 2016 advocates in Oregon 
spoke with a man named Charles who was 
automatically registered to vote. Charles 
was an African American and disabled vet-
eran of both Korea and Vietnam wars who 
was told by his commanders not to register 
to vote because ‘‘Black men shouldn’t vote.’’ 
Thanks to Oregon’s AVR legislation, Charles 
cast his ballot for the very first time—ensur-
ing his vote had a place in Oregon’s democ-
racy. 
ONLINE VOTER REGISTRATION/PRE- 
REGISTRATION FOR 16 AND 17-YEAR-OLDS 
Oregon’s online voter registration tool pro-
vides Oregonians a convenient and secure 
way to make sure they can participate in the 
democratic process. Oregon first imple-
mented on line voter registration in 2009. In 
the first year of implementation almost 
87,000 Oregonians used the system. 
Just a few years after, Oregon began allow-
ing 16 and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote 
under the online voter registration system 
and through the AVR system. Oregon’s on-
line voter registration system, also allows 
Oregonians to conveniently update their reg-
istration if they move, change their name or 
mailing address, or want to select or change 
a political party. 
VOTING RIGHTS FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED 
INDIVIDUALS 
Oregon allows previously incarcerated in-
dividuals the right to register to vote in Or-
egon. Persons convicted of a felony, whether 
the defendant serves their term of incarcer-
ation in a state correctional facility or in a 
county jail, cannot vote while they are serv-
ing their term of incarceration for the fel-
ony. All others in the criminal justice sys-
tem retain their right to vote (such as pre- 
trial detainees, persons serving misdemeanor 
sentences in county jails, persons on parole 
or probation). 
Voting rights are restored when a person 
convicted of a felony is released from incar-
ceration. However, once released from incar-
ceration they must re-register to vote in 
order to restore their voting rights. 
VOTING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES 
Oregon allows individuals who are visually 
impaired to request a large format ballot 
from their local county clerk’s office. The 
election clerks can send them a video, and/or 
an audio clip to assist individuals with fill-
ing out their ballot privately and securely. 
Voters with no or limited vision can use a 
screen reader to have ballots and the voters’ 
pamphlets read to them. Voters using tablets 
to mark a ballot can increase the size of the 
font and change the color and contrast of the 
text. Additionally, Oregonians can utilize a 
screen reader or other technology to access a 
ballot at home using ‘‘My Vote.’’ 
Tablets also help voters with cognitive dis-
abilities or limited reading capabilities. 
They work well for voters with limited range 
of motion. Voters who are quadriplegic or 
have severe arthritis can use their fingers or 
a number of assistive technologies, such as 
sip-and-puff systems, to mark their ballots. 
Any Oregon voter who needs assistance 
with can get assistance registering to vote, 
voting, or returning their ballot and are en-
couraged to contact their local election offi-
cials to ask for assistance and support. 
CONCLUSION 
We are proud of our trailblazing efforts to 
ensure all eligible Oregonians have access to 
the ballot box. In Oregon we believe, regard-
less of political party or affiliation, that de-
mocracy works when everyone is represented 
and everyone can participate and have their 
voice heard. H.R. 1 is necessary to ensure 
Americans who all too often face barriers to 
the ballot box have an opportunity to have 
their voice heard. 
H.R. 1 builds upon best practices we have 
built here in Oregon. We are proud to lead by 
example with safe, secure, transparent, effi-
cient, and modern policies that have been

RECOGNIZING THE 29TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE KHOJALY MAS-
SACRE 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this past 
week marks the 29th anniversary of the mas-
sacre of hundreds of people in the town of 
Khojaly, Azerbaijan. This was the largest kill-
ing of ethnic Azerbaijani civilians during the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Khojaly, which is 
in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, 
was once home to 7,000 people. On February 
26, 1992, Armenian armed forces massacred 
over 600 unarmed people—including 106 
women and 83 children—and left less than 
2,000 survivors. Hundreds more became dis-
abled due to their injuries. More than 100 chil-
dren lost a parent and 25 children lost both 
parents. At least 8 families were all killed. This 
is a devastating tragedy. 
A cease-fire was negotiated in 1994, but the 
conflict remains unresolved. In the wake of the 
2020 fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia 
in the Nagorno-Karabakh, it is my hope that 
Armenia and Azerbaijan can finally come to 
the table and find peace. Long-term peace, 
security, and regional cooperation are in the 
best interests of the entire region of the South 
Caucasus and the world. 
Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the 
United States and its allies. This cooperation 
has included: playing a leadership role in non-
proliferation issues; providing troops to serve 
shoulder-to-shoulder 
with 
U.S. 
forces 
in 
Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan; allowing transit 
of non-lethal equipment used by coalition 
forces through Azerbaijan to Afghanistan; con-
struction of the Southern Gas Corridor from 
the Caspian Sea to Italy, thereby providing 
Europe with an alternative to Russian energy 
sources; and supplying 40 percent of Israel’s 
oil. Azerbaijan also has a thriving Jewish com-
munity and has outstanding relations with 
Israel. As Azerbaijanis throughout the world 
commemorate the massacre and continue to 
grieve the loss of loved ones, I hope they can 
find peace amidst this tragedy.

HONORING THE FAITHFUL SERV-
ICE OF ARMY MAJOR GENERAL 
BRIAN E. WINSKI 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Army Major Gen-
eral Brian Winski for his distinguished and re-
markable service to this nation. Major General 
Winski joined the Army in 1989 and was com-
missioned as an officer through the University 
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s ROTC program. 
His tenacious spirit and tireless work ethic 
propelled his swift rise through the ranks. 
Within a few short years, he saw duty as a 
Rifle Platoon Leader during Desert Storm, and 
he served in Iraq as Chief of Operations for 
the famed 101st Airborne Division, Squadron 
Commander in the 61st Cavalry Regiment, 
and Brigade Combat Team Commander for 
the 1st Cavalry Division. Major General Winski 
proceeded to serve as Chief Legislative a Liai-
son for the Office of the Secretary of the Army 
before assuming his duties as the Com-
manding General of the 101st Airborne Divi-
sion and Fort Campbell. 
Throughout his nearly four decades of serv-
ice, Major General Winski has been a con-
stant example of the Army’s core principles of 
duty, honor, and courage. In 2006 he was 
awarded the Bronze Star for Valor for his gal-
lant leadership under enemy fire in a fierce 
90-minute firefight. When approaching his mis-
sion objective, a contingent of insurgents 
opened fire on his squad, crippling one of their 
vehicles. Major General Winski took decisive 
action and led the men under his command to 
dispatch 11 enemy combatants, driving the re-
maining insurgents to retreat. 
Major General Winski’s leadership extends 
far beyond the battlefield. Under his leader-
ship, Fort Campbell has been a model Army 
base, earning the top ranking in the U.S. Army 
Installation Management Command for the 
most intergovernmental support agreements. 
Furthermore, Major General Winski was instru-
mental in facilitating the construction of a local 
middle school, which will serve the needs of 
the families stationed at Fort Campbell. Al-
though Fort Campbell faced unprecedented 
challenges during the pandemic, Major Gen-
eral Winski’s leadership ensured that the base 
was able to maintain readiness in uncertain 
circumstances. Under his guidance, Fort 
Campbell was able to provide critical medical 
assistance to cities stricken the hardest by the 
pandemic. 
Without question, Major General Winski is a 
true patriot and has repeatedly gone above 
and beyond the call of duty. In his command 
of soldiers both stateside and across the 
world, he has led with honor and integrity. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in expressing 
our deepest gratitude for his faithful service 
and commitment to the defense of our nation.

HONORING MAYOR HAZELLE P. 
ROGERS 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished Hazelle P. 
Rogers. On the eve of 25 years of life in pub-
lic service, Mrs. Rogers has demonstrated her 
commitment to her friends and family, her 
community, and the state of Florida. Along the 
way, she has made history. Mrs. Rogers’ first 
election in 1996 made her the first person 
from the Caribbean American community to be 
elected to office in the southeastern United 
States. Furthermore, she became the first Ja-
maican to be elected to the Florida House of 
Representatives. 
Mrs. Rogers has dedicated herself to the 
public and continues to give back to her com-
munity in the humblest of ways. In 2014, 
former Representative Rogers was a strong 
advocate for in-state tuition for undocumented 
students which earned her the Broward Col-
lege 2014 Award for support of the ‘Florida 
Dreamers’ Legislation. The communities Mrs. 
Rogers has led have always admired her lead-
ership and commitment as she is also the re-
cipient of honorable community awards such 
as the Florida Association of Counties’ Cham-
pion Award; the Jamaican American Bar Asso-
ciation Legislative Award; and the Florida 
League of Cities’ Legislative Appreciation 
Award for four consecutive years. 
In November, the city of Lauderdale Lakes 
elevated her to an outstanding victory with a 
66 percent vote to the office of Mayor. As 
Mayor, economic empowerment and economic 
development for the underprivileged in her 
community are her passion and fortitude. 
Mayor Rogers continues to build consensus 
around issues and support programs that are 
lifting community members out of poverty and 
into financial stability. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my best wishes 
and regards to not only Mayor Rogers, but 
also to Mrs. Rogers’ husband, Mr. Clifton Rog-
ers; and the rest of her family and friends for 
an outstanding and wonderful life in public 
service.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
RESEARCH ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am introducing the National Gun Vio-
lence Research Act. 
As Chairwoman of the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology, I am com-
mitted to elevating the voice of science in the 
consequential deliberations taking place in this 
body. In our efforts to develop fair, effective, 
and sustainable policy solutions to the chal-
lenges facing the American people, we must 
ensure we are drawing from a strong base of 
evidence. My fellow Committee Members and 
I are dedicated to ensuring that the U.S. sci-
entific enterprise is equipped with the re-
sources it needs to derive that evidence. As 
the 
COVID–19 
crisis 
has 
clearly 
dem-
onstrated, there are enormous benefits to hav-
ing a thriving research ecosystem in place that 
is poised to respond when called upon. 
Gun violence is a threat to our national wel-
fare. The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) released a report reviewing 
the latest gun mortality data last month enti-
tled A Public Health Crisis Decades in the 
Making. And the numbers are stark. For the 
past three years in a row, nearly 40,000 peo-
ple were killed by guns in the United States. 
The vast majority of these deaths, 86 percent, 
were males. Tragically, one in ten were chil-
dren and teens. Put another way, guns were 
the leading cause of deaths for Americans age 
1 to 24. After years of slow, but steady de-
cline, gun homicides are on the rise, account-
ing for one third of gun deaths in 2019. Black 
men are more than 20 times as likely as White 
men to be victims of firearm homicide. The 
majority of firearm deaths are suicides. The 
rate of suicide fatalities has steadily increased 
over the past decade, with white men more 
than twice as likely to die by firearm suicide 
than non-white men. 
And the stressors associated with the 
COVID–19 crisis have not helped. Early re-
search suggests that the rate of gun violence

has risen dramatically during the pandemic, 
with factors such as increased unemployment, 
increased alcohol consumption, and increased 
firearm purchases potentially playing a role. 
The fact is that gun violence is rampant in 
our society and lives will continue to be lost 
unless we act decisively to stem this tide. I 
commend my colleagues in the Gun Violence 
Prevention Task Force for their leadership in 
advancing the policy discussions surrounding 
this issue. I was thrilled to see the appropria-
tions committees approve $25 million for the 
CDC and the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) to support gun violence research, finally 
putting an end to the de facto ban on federal 
funding for this important area of study. 
We are heading in the right direction, but 
there is much more to be done. We must take 
a bold, comprehensive approach to grow the 
field of gun violence research. We need to at-
tract more students to careers in gun violence 
research and support interdisciplinary collabo-
ration to connect experts in public health with 
those in criminology and the social and behav-
ioral sciences. We need to support the trans-
lation of research into effective policy interven-
tions. We need better coordination among key 
agencies like the CDC, NIH, the National 
Science Foundation, the National Institutes of 
Standards and Technology, and the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
The National Gun Violence Research Act 
takes a whole-of-government approach to ad-
dressing the paucity of federal funding for re-
search on gun violence by directing the Presi-
dent to establish a six-year National Gun Vio-
lence Research Program. To carry out the 
program, funding is authorized for the National 
Science Foundation ($15 M), the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology ($1 M), 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices ($25 M), and the Department of Justice 
($3 M) to conduct or support gun violence re-
search. In addition to awarding individual re-
search grants, the National Science Founda-
tion is directed to establish a much-needed 
national center for violence research to en-
courage multidisciplinary collaboration and 
train the next generation of gun violence re-
searchers. Research enabled by this legisla-
tion will improve our understanding of gun vio-
lence so we can advance effective solutions 
and save lives.

REVISITING JANUARY 6TH 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, no one is defending the violent riot 
at the Capitol on January 6th and as more evi-
dence is reviewed, I am grateful for the insight 
today by columnist Jack Devine in The Aiken 
Standard: 
‘‘My column four weeks ago—‘‘The insur-
rection 
that 
wasn’t’’—argued 
that 
por-
traying the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol 
as an armed insurrection is simply wrong, 
unsupported by the facts. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
many 
disagree. 
The 
armed insurrection label has been repeated 
so often and by so many that it has become 
widely accepted as true. 
But we’ve learned a great deal since then 
about what happened on Jan. 6 and what 
didn’t—and we’ve watched as the new Demo-
cratic leadership takes extreme and dis-
turbing actions to slay the imaginary dragon 
that they created. 
Let’s take another look. 
The Capitol insurgents—mainly rowdy pro-
testers caught up in the moment—were not 
armed in any real sense. Their inventory of 
‘‘dangerous and deadly weapons,’’ as classi-
fied by DOJ investigators, consist of two 
baseball bats, a hockey stick, one pocket- 
sized extendable baton, a few cans of com-
mercially available pepper spray and bear re-
pellant, and other makeshift odds and ends. 
No knives and no guns. The infamous zip- 
ties, initially considered to be proof positive 
that the insurgents intended to take hos-
tages, were later determined to have been 
carried into the building by police officers. 
The myth that Capitol Police Officer Brian 
Sicknick was murdered by the frenzied mob 
has evaporated completely. The New York 
Times has backed away from its bludgeoned- 
by-fire-extinguisher report; there was no evi-
dence of blunt force trauma; it appears that 
Sicknick died of natural causes (probably a 
stroke) hours after returning to the station 
house under his own power. 
Only one gun was fired during the four- 
hour assault—that by an unidentified police 
officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt, an 
unarmed female trespasser. While the FBI is 
still combing videos to find someone to 
charge for Sicknick’s death, both they and 
the otherwise pit bull media seem remark-
ably incurious about Babbitt’s killing. 
None of the supposed targets of the Capitol 
assault—Democratic lawmakers and Vice 
President Pence—were harmed; and the 2020 
election result was not derailed by the at-
tack and was never in serious jeopardy. 
Make no mistake. The Jan. 6 riot was reck-
less, angry and ultimately lethal. It cannot 
be condoned. But for a supposed overthrow of 
the U.S. government, it looks pretty lame— 
and more like the continuing wanton rioting 
that since mid-summer has taken dozens of 
lives, destroyed untold livelihoods and cost 
billions in damage to American cities. 
A mindless mob bent on venting its anger? 
Yes. An armed insurrection? Not even close. 
And how are we dealing with this non-in-
surrection? 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pushing for 
investigation by a ‘‘9/11-style commission’’— 
implying that this bumbling fiasco was 
somehow comparable to the 2001 terrorist at-
tack that murdered nearly 3,000 Americans. 
The U.S. Capitol complex in Washington, 
D.C., has been turned into an armed camp. It 
was guarded during the inauguration by 
25,000 National Guard troops, thousands of 
whom still remain. The barriers and check-
points will be kept in place through Sep-
tember. So far, none of the feared domestic 
terrorists have reappeared. 
The Justice Department has been con-
ducting a nationwide manhunt for the Jan. 6 
perpetrators and to date has arrested and 
charged over 300. Reportedly, dozens are 
being held without bail—a measure usually 
reserved for hardened criminals arrested for 
heinous crimes—in stark contrast to the re-
volving door treatment of thousands of vio-
lent rioters apprehended in recent months 
and quickly released (and provided bail 
money if needed by progressive organiza-
tions, as encouraged by Democratic leaders 
including Vice President Kamala Harris). 
Prospective U.S. Attorney General Merrick 
Garland promises to prosecute the Jan. 6 
perpetrators to the full extent of the law. It 
would be far better to call that riot what it 
is, acknowledge the broader issue of esca-
lating American violence and deal with it in 
an even-handed way. 
In my column last month, I characterized 
our government’s response to the supposed 
insurrection as ‘‘performance art’’—the art 
form that utilizes dramatic live performance 
to evoke an emotional response. It’s an apt 
comparison. The net effect of the actions 
outlined above has been to cement in the 
public mind inordinate fear of the risk posed 
by domestic terrorism, particularly of the 
white supremacist variety. 
Our leadership seems to think that if we’re 
all terrified enough, we’ll go along without 
objection to the politicized show-and-tell— 
Capitol Hill barricaded and patrolled by 
armed troops, perpetrators hunted and held 
without bond, suspension of due process, 
rampant censorship—America on a wartime 
footing, but without the war. 
Any threat of terrorism, foreign or domes-
tic, from left or right, deserves serious atten-
tion—not hyperbole and hysteria.’’

RETIREMENT OF LIFELONG COM-
MUNITY ADVOCATE LAURA MAR-
TINEZ 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the retirement of Laura Martinez, 
a public servant who has spent a lifetime help-
ing her community, most recently as the Con-
stituent Services Director for the Office of 
Congressman LUIS CORREA in Orange County, 
California. 
Over her 30-year career in public service, 
Ms. Martinez has literally helped thousands of 
individuals and families resolve issues with 
local, state and federal agencies. Ms. Martinez 
devoted 20-years of her public service career 
with the Office of Congresswoman Loretta 
Sanchez. 
Throughout her years of service, Ms. Mar-
tinez developed relationships with liaisons rep-
resenting Social Security, the IRS, Medicare, 
Immigration and Customs, and other entities. 
By using her expertise in navigating the 
complicated immigration system and over-
coming bureaucratic roadblocks, she was able 
to reunite families during emergencies, obtain-
ing citizenships, visas, and much more. 
Born in the Boyle Heights area of Los Ange-
les, Ms. Martinez grew up witnessing many 
acts of racial injustice. Her dream and lifelong 
mission was to help those who did not have 
the capability to help themselves due to living 
in poverty, being a minority, and living in other 
challenging conditions. 
She brought heartfelt passion to her work 
that included positions with such non-profits as 
the renowned City of Hope and The East Los 
Angeles Community Union, which helps em-
power communities and revitalize neighbor-
hoods. 
As a breast cancer survivor, along with her 
mother, she is a decades long participant in 
the American Cancer Society Relay for Life. 
Her team, Laura’s Lifeline, has raised thou-
sands of dollars to battle cancer. 
Another passion was working with Latino 
Advocates for Education, an organization that 
pays tribute to WWII veterans. Her uncles 
were all veterans who served in WWII and the 
Korean and Vietnam wars. She was the only 
girl in a family of six boys, several of whom 
served in law enforcement. 
Ms. Martinez was honored for her work with 
veterans by being invited to witness the un-
veiling of the WWII Memorial in our nation’s 
capital.

tended family and traveling. 
Please join me in wishing this good and 
faithful public servant a well-deserved retire-

HONORING 
THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
OSCEOLA COUNTY NAACP AND 
ITS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO AD-
VANCE CIVIL RIGHTS IN OSCE-
OLA COUNTY 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, founded in 
1909 in response to the ongoing violence 
against Black people around the country, the 
NAACP is the largest and most pre-eminent 
civil rights organization in the nation. One hun-
dred and twelve years later, the organization 
has over 2,200 branches across the nation 
with more than 2 million members. 
The NAACP’s mission is to secure the polit-
ical, educational, social, and economic equal-
ity of rights to eliminate race-based discrimina-
tion and ensure the health and well-being of 
all persons. The NAACP is integral to ensure 
a society in which all individuals have equal 
rights without discrimination on race. 
The Osceola branch of the NAACP was 
originally 
established 
as 
the 
Kissimmee 
NAACP in 1965 and later changed to its cur-
rent name in the early 1970’s as the Osceola 
County Branch 5121. Reverend T.C. Callahan 
served as the branch’s first president. The 
branch is currently led by Deloris McMillon. 
The Osceola branch of the NAACP works to 
promote civic engagement among its commu-
nity through voter registration drives. It also 
recognizes outstanding citizens and leaders to 
inspire younger generations to participate in 
their community. 
The strength of the NAACP is dependent on 
support from the community. The NAACP 
seeks enactment and enforcement of federal, 
state, and local laws securing civil rights. It 
tirelessly provides for and supports their com-
munities and equality of all citizens.

Hardin County Chamber of Commerce. 
Since 2011, he has worked in his leadership 
role to promote economic development, ad-

omy in Hardin County. Brad played a funda-
mental role in establishing the Knox Regional 
Development Alliance (KRDA), and in 2017, 
he was given the Ft. Knox Gold Neighbor 
Award for his work in bringing together Fort 
Knox and nearby communities. He also in-
vested in the next generation of local talent 
through the Youth Leadership Hardin County 
and Leadership Hardin County programs. 
I want to thank Brad for his work in the Har-
din County community.

SUPPORTING TEXAS AFTER 
WINTER STORM DAMAGE 
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to ask for continued support of my 
district, my city and my state, as we recover 
from the impact of the winter storm. Many 
Texans are still suffering. 
Even worse, many are still grieving the loss 
of a loved one. In Harris county alone, 25 
human lives were lost as a consequence of 
this storm. 
Senior citizens account for more than one 
third of the deaths in Harris County. 
One woman, 100 years old, was taken to a 
hospital after being found unresponsive in a 
home with no power. 
The youngest victim was just 8, he was 
found in a home while using a gas-powered 
generator, dying of carbon monoxide poi-
soning. 
The damage extends far beyond the city of 
Houston. Over 200 Texans died. Thousands 
lost their homes, and 390 thousand still lack 
access to clean water. 
I ask my colleagues, and those watching, 
that they continue to pray for the people of 
Texas, and that they help in any way they 
can. 
For those who have already helped I thank 
you. Thank you very much (Muchisimas 
gracias).

REMEMERING APOSTLE 
FREDERICK K.C. PRICE 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Apostle Frederick K.C. 
Price of Los Angeles, California, who died on 
February 12, 2021 at the age of 89. 
Apostle Frederick K.C. Price is the founder 
of Crenshaw Christian Center (CCC) in Los 
Angeles, California. He began CCC in 1973 
and shepherded it into a ministry of world re-
nown, with services held in the 10,000-seat 
FaithDome. 
In 1978, Apostle Price received instruction 
from God to begin a television broadcast and, 
as a result, Ever Increasing Faith Ministries 
(EIFM) began broadcasting in five major tele-
vision markets. Thus, the television broadcast 
soon after became global. 
EIFM can be viewed on many television sta-
tions in all 50 states and in many foreign 
countries. Apostle Price is also heard on nu-
merous radio programs and 19 Internet broad-
cast stations. Additionally, he can be seen on 
most 
social 
media 
platforms, 
including 
Facebook, 
Twitter, 
Instagram, 
YouTube, 
Pinterest, and others. In 1990, Apostle Price 
founded the Fellowship of Inner-City Word of 
Faith Ministries (FICWFM), which later be-
came the Fellowship of International Christian 
Word of Faith Ministries before disbanding in 
2017. And in 2001, he established an East 
Coast church, Crenshaw Christian Center 
East. 
A visionary and prolific author, Apostle Price 
is the author of some 50 books on faith, heal-
ing, prosperity, and the Holy Spirit. How Faith 
Works is a classic on the operation of faith 
and its life-changing principles. 
Although he had already operated in the 
fivefold ministry gift of apostle, in 2008 Apostle 
Price was publicly affirmed as an apostle of 
faith. Under the mantle of the teaching gift, 
Apostle Price established several schools for 
ministry and formal education at CCC. Among 
them are Frederick K.C. Price Ill Christian 
Schools (preschool to 12th grade); the Ministry 
Training Institute in 1985; a CCC Correspond-
ence School; the Frederick K.C. Price School 
of the Bible; and in 2008, the Apostle Price 
Ministry Training Center. Over the years, 
Apostle Price has received many prestigious 
awards, most notably the Horatio Alger Award 
and the Kelly Miller Smith Interfaith Award. 
A year after his affirmation and after more 
than 35 years of service, Apostle Price 
stepped aside as pastor to formally install his 
son, Frederick K. Price Jr., as his successor. 
For years he served as the presiding prelate 
of both CCC West and CCC East and as the 
chairman of CCC’s board of directors. 
A devout husband and proud father, Apostle 
Price is survived by his wife of 67 years, Dr. 
Betty Price, four children, ten grandchildren, 
and four great-grandchildren. 
I am proud to call myself a friend of the 
Price family, and I extend my deepest condo-
lences to them and to the countless lives 
touched by the life and work of Apostle Fred-
erick K.C. Price.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
the precious right to vote in free and fair elec-
tions at all levels in the United States will be 
seriously jeopardized if H.R. 1 becomes law. 
Under an egregiously false facade of re-
form, the legislation consolidates and conveys 
new sweeping powers to regulate elections to 
bureaucrats in the federal government and 
nullifies existing state laws requiring valid 
identification before either registering to vote 
or casting a ballot. 
More than two-thirds of states currently rely 
on voter ID laws to protect the sanctity of the 
vote. Weakening—even prohibiting—certain 
safeguards against fraud will make our elec-
tions less secure, more vulnerable to fraudu-
lent activity, and will undermine participation in 
our democracy. 
Other safeguards designed to mitigate voter 
fraud are also abolished, including bans on 
ballot harvesting. 
All states will be required to enable the 
practice of same day registration and voting

which precludes any serious process at the 
local level to verify the eligibility of the appli-
cant to vote. 
By making it illegal to scrutinize voter rolls 
with an interstate cross-check and by refusing 
any cross-check removals from the voter rolls 
within six months of an election, officials will 
be stymied in their duty to remove illegal and 
ineligible voters. 
H.R. 1 is embedded with free speech in-
fringements that even the American Civil Lib-
erties Union (ACLU) has harshly criticized say-
ing it ‘‘contains significant flaws that are detri-
mental to the health of our democracy.’’ 
H.R. 1 politicizes the FEC by turning the 
current bipartisan commission into a partisan 
entity and expands the powers of the FEC 
chair, effectively destroying the agency’s abil-
ity to ensure fair elections by leaving important 
decisions on what is acceptable speech to a 
single individual. 
And by allowing the IRS to investigate and 
consider political views of an organization be-
fore granting tax-exempt status, this legislation 
empowers federal bureaucrats—with agen-
das—to decide which views should be re-
warded or penalized. 
The bill also mandates states to give the 
right to vote to all felons who have been re-
leased from prison. Yesterday, the Democrats 
tried—but failed—to go further with an amend-
ment to expand voting rights to criminals cur-
rently serving time in jail. 
H.R. 1 creates a 6 to 1 funding match for 
contributions of $200 or less to a congres-
sional or presidential campaign—meaning for 
every $200, the federal government will match 
$1,200. 
The Congress can—and must—do better.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SUSAN WILD 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I represent a 
Congressional district with nearly equal num-
bers of Democrats, Republicans, and Inde-
pendents. But when it comes to the question 
of whether everyday Americans’ interests are 
reflected in their government, I hear the same 
message from my constituents, almost unani-
mously. 
Regardless of political affiliation, my con-
stituents seem to agree that dark money is 
drowning out the voices of working families. 
And they are outraged that lobbyists for the 
most powerful interests have a degree of ac-
cess to our political system that is unheard of 
for an everyday citizen. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, would begin 
the work of returning power to the American 
people. Among many important provisions, it 
would implement landmark anti-corruption re-
forms, including: requiring super PACS and 
dark money groups to disclose their donors, 
strengthening ‘‘conflict of interest’’ require-
ments for federal officials, and preventing 
members of Congress from serving on cor-
porate boards. I’m also proud to have intro-
duced the Lobbyist Loophole Closure Act as 
part of H.R. 1, which will enact more robust 
regulations around what constitutes lobbying 
and ensure no one can skirt federal lobbying 
rules. 
Together, let’s restore the trust of the Amer-
ican people in their government.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support for H.R. 1, the For the People 
Act, and am proud to be a cosponsor of this 
bill. It will fight big money in politics, take on 
the power of special interests, end dark 
money, and ensure public officials are working 
in the public interest. It will expand voting 
rights to ensure we have secure, accurate 
elections and stop voter suppression efforts 
designed to keep people from voting based on 
their perceived political preferences. It ends 
extreme partisan gerrymandering by creating a 
non-partisan, open process to draw trans-
parent and fair congressional district maps. 
This bill will also hold elected officials account-
able by implementing tougher ethics laws to 
ensure elected officials are held accountable. 
I am also proud to cosponsor an important 
amendment to this bill with my colleague Con-
gresswoman SPEIER. Our amendment extends 
the statute of limitations on campaign finance 
violations. As a former law enforcement offi-
cer, I know that extending the statute of limita-
tions is necessary to improve accountability 
and ensure that those who break campaign fi-
nance laws and then try to hide their actions 
can be brought to justice. As we have learned 
in recent events, violations of campaign fi-
nance laws may not be uncovered until years 
after the fact. Extending the statute of limita-
tions provides investigators and prosecutors 
the ability to go after those who the break the 
law. This is an important addition to H.R. 1, 
the For the People Act. 
However, there is one provision in the bill 
that I believe could be improved, and I look 
forward to working with Chairwoman LOFGREN 
to make improvements. I was just recently 
made aware of concerns about voting ma-
chines that will need to be updated or rede-
signed after enactment of H.R. 1, including 
some equipment like Direct Recording Elec-
tronic (DRE) voting machines. I would like to 
make sure that we don’t exclude machines 
that are currently approved by the Election As-
sistance Commission without providing rea-
sonable time and assistance to bring these 
machines into compliance with the new, higher 
standards of H.R. 1. In my home state of Indi-
ana, many counties rely on DRE machines, 
and transitioning to the higher standards will 
require time and resources that I hope we can 
provide. Also, I have learned that the disability 
community has concerns about these provi-
sions, so I would like to include in the RECORD 
a statement describing their concerns. I am 
committed to working with my colleagues to 
address these concerns so we can make vot-
ing more accessible for everyone. 
DISABILITY COMMUNITY FEARS PAPER BALLOT 
MANDATE WILL HURT VOTERS WITH DIS-
ABILITIES 
[Jan. 29, 2021] 
WASHINGTON, DC.—Today, the undersigned 
disability organizations issued the following 
joint statement expressing concerns over a 
paper ballot mandate. 
How ballots are cast in the United States 
varies depending on what different jurisdic-
tions offer to their voters. Today, most vot-
ers in the U.S. cast their ballot by marking 
a paper ballot by hand or by Ballot-Marking 
Device (BMD), with some use of Direct Re-
cording Electronic (DRE) voting machines. 
Most American voters are familiar with 
the former, which requires voters to mark, 
verify and cast a paper-based ballot. BMDs 
use an electronic interface to aid voters in 
marking their ballot. Once the voter has 
made selections with the BMD, the device di-
rectly marks on or prints the ballot. The 
voter then typically verifies and casts the 
ballot into the same optical (or digital) vot-
ing scanner that hand marked paper ballots 
are cast. BMDs simply increase the accessi-
bility of paper ballots by allowing voters 
with disabilities to use these accessible vot-
ing machines to magnify, ‘voice,’ and mark 
their ballots. For example, a blind voter can-
not privately and independently mark a 
paper ballot with a pen, however, they can 
privately and independently mark their bal-
lot using a BMD. 
DRE voting systems, on the other hand, 
allow voters to use an electronic interface to 
mark, verify and cast their votes electroni-
cally with or without a paper back up. Argu-
ably, DREs provide the best option for vot-
ing privately and independently for all vot-
ers with all types of access needs based on 
age, disability, language fluency, literacy, 
and many other individual circumstances, as 
guaranteed to all voters by the Help America 
Vote Act and Americans with Disabilities 
Act. DREs eliminate the need to handle or 
directly verify a paper ballot, which prevents 
BMD voting systems from being fully acces-
sible to all eligible voters. 
Despite overall reduced paper consumption 
in many areas of daily life, as a result of 
technological advancement, paper-based bal-
lot voting options have become the preferred 
voting system to many who believe man-
dating the use of paper ballots is necessary 
to ensure the security of our elections. How-
ever, it must be made abundantly clear, that 
the ability to privately and independently 
hand mark, verify, and cast a paper ballot is 
simply not, and will never be, an option for 
all voters. 
Given that paper ballots are already the 
predominant method of casting a ballot in 
America today, mandating paper ballots is 
frankly unnecessary. Additionally, any man-
date of a paper-based voting system will in-
evitably harm voters with disabilities. A 
paper ballot mandate would: 1.) end all vot-
ing system innovation and advancement to 
produce a fully accessible voting system that 
provides enhanced security without relying 
on inaccessible paper; 2.) limit voters with 
disabilities’ federal right to privately and 
independently verify and cast their ballots 
and; 3.) ultimately segregate voters with dis-
abilities. 
Further, any paper ballot mandate that en-
titles voters to a hand marked ballot threat-
ens the availability of BMDs for voters who 
rely on them to mark their ballots and dras-
tically limits use of BMDs to voters with dis-
abilities. This would result in segregating 
voters with disabilities away from the entire 
pool of voters by making them the only 
group of people that use a particular type of 
voting machine. Federally mandated seg-
regation is problematic alone, but in prac-
tice, it also increases the likelihood that poll 
workers will not be properly trained on the 
machine, the machines will not be properly 
maintained or set up for use, and if the only 
available BMD is not functioning, there is no 
alternative option for voters who need it. 
Limits on BMD use will also saddle poll 
workers with determining who is ‘‘disabled 
enough’’ to use the BMD, a decision for

which they have no qualifications or legal 
right. Finally, if the ballot produced by the 
BMD is not identical to the hand marked 
ballot or the BMD ballot cannot be scanned 
and stored with hand marked ballots, the 
voters right to cast a private ballot is vio-
lated. 
To be clear, no paper ballot voting system 
today, ready for widespread use, is fully ac-
cessible. Even BMDs require voters with dis-
abilities to verify and a cast a paper-based 
ballot, which does not ensure a private and 
independent vote. A fully accessible voting 
system by Federal law must ensure the voter 
can receive, mark, verify, and cast the ballot 
without having to handle paper. Most, if not 
all, market-ready voting systems cannot do 
this. 
Before paper-based voting systems become 
the law of the land, the harm to voters with 
disabilities must be addressed.

JOE NOVOTNY’S RETIREMENT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, this 
week marks the end of an era as Joe Novotny 
concludes a thirty-year career in the House, 
the last ten as our Reading Clerk. 
In a sense, it seems longer than ten years 
in that he assumed that role naturally with 
such quiet competence. He was unflappable in 
the midst of often frantic activity. He is the 
face of a critically important and complex set 
of activities that keeps the House legislative 
process moving forward. Even when it seems 
like we’re not doing much, it takes a lot of 
people and a lot of moving pieces to make it 
look that way. 
It’s almost as though he was born for this 
important role, having literally grown up in the 
House. He was a House page, a program that 
allowed for so many young people to see first-
hand the legislative process Hill. 
Joe’s rise through the ranks culminated with 
his decade as House Reading Clerk. He has 
steadily and thoughtfully performed his duties 
in exemplary fashion. He has been personally 
warm and helpful, being a perfect representa-
tion for the many men and women behind the 
scenes that hold his place together. 
I, along with thousands of C–SPAN junkies, 
will miss Joe, and we all wish him the very 
best in the next chapters of his career and life.
