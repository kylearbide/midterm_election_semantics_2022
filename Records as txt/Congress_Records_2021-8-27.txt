FEDERAL SHIP FINANCING 
PROGRAM 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce legislation expanding the Maritime 
Administration’s (MARAD) federal ship financ-
ing program—commonly referred to as ‘‘Title 
XI’’ of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936—to in-
clude re-flagging, repair, or conversions of US- 
flagged civilian vessels for commercial and 
military purposes. 
Currently, MARAD’s Title XI program only 
provides federal loan guarantees for the con-
struction of new civilian vessels in U.S.-based 
commercial shipyards or facility and equip-
ment upgrades at those shipyards. My legisla-
tion would allow MARAD to also provide loan 
guarantees for corrective or preventative main-
tenance or re-flagging work at US-based ship-
yards, including to convert a commercial ves-
sel to a more useful military configuration to 
carry out federal contracts. 
As chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Readiness and the former 
ranking member of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Subcommittee on Coast Guard 
and Maritime Transportation, I have long sup-
ported our domestic shipbuilding and U.S.- 
flagged international fleet. 
The legislation I introduced today builds 
upon my work in the William M. (Mac) Thorn-
berry National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283), in 
which I helped to secure Congressional au-
thorization for the new tanker security fleet 
and strengthened the military’s U.S.-flagged 
preference for seaborne cargo contracts. It 
also complements my work with U.S. Senator 
TAMMY BALDWIN (D–WI) in the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 
(Public Law 116–92), in which we imple-
mented 
‘‘Buy 
America’’ 
requirements 
for 
MARAD’s small shipyard grant program. 
Madam Speaker, American shipyards are 
ready, willing, and able to take on this addi-
tional work. Expanding MARAD’s Title XI loan 
guarantee program to support that work 
means more well-paying jobs for American 
workers and better maintained vessels flagged 
in the United States, useful for military and 
commercial purposes.

HONORING DETECTIVE EVERETT 
BRISCOE 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember Detective Everett 
Briscoe, a veteran of the New Orleans Police 
Department who was tragically shot and killed 
while off-duty in Houston this weekend. 
Officer Briscoe served the New Orleans 
community for over 12 years, which included 
work for the department’s homicide investiga-
tions division. 
He was a father of two children and a friend 
to many. I’m lucky to have befriended him 
through our shared membership of the Zulu 
Social Aid & Pleasure Club, a Mardi Gras or-
ganization. 
I was lucky to call him my Zulu brother. 
Praying for his family, his friends, and the 
other victim in this senseless act of violence. 
Sometimes 
life, 
in 
all 
its 
beauty, 
is 
inexplicably tragic. 
But we will always have the memories we 
have shared together. 
Rest in Peace, Detective Briscoe.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ILLI-
NOIS STATE SENATOR WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ HAINE 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of Illinois State Senator Wil-
liam ‘‘Bill’’ Haine, who passed away at the age 
of 77 on August 16. Bill was born on August 
8, 1944 in Alton, Illinois, to Mary and James 
Haine. In the late 1960s, Bill served in the 
U.S. Army during the Vietnam War as a mem-
ber of the First Cavalry Division (Air Mobile) 
and was awarded the Bronze Star for his serv-
ice in combat operations. After returning home 
from Vietnam, Bill earned his JD from St. 
Louis University School of Law. There he met 
and later married his wife, Anna. They were 
blessed with seven children: Cecelia Phil-
ippine, Elizabeth Schlueter, Mary Burkett, Mar-
garet Balan, Alice Stirton, Thomas, and Jo-
seph, 37 grandchildren, and one great grand-
child. Through it all, Bill was always involved 
in local politics in Madison County. He served 
on the Madison County Board and then be-
came the State’s Attorney for Madison County 
in 1988—a position he held for 14 years. In 
2002, he was appointed to fill the Illinois Sen-
ate seat for the 56th district and served in that 
role for five terms. Madam Speaker, please 
join me in this celebration of the life of Bill 
Haine. On behalf of Southern Illinois, I thank 
Bill for service to our community. My prayers 
go out to Bill’s wife Anna, their family, and 
friends during this difficult time.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, due to un-
foreseen circumstances, I missed the vote on 
final passage of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021. I am 
an original cosponsor of the bill and support 
the legislation, having previously voted in sup-
port of this bill when it passed the House on 
December 6, 2019. Had I been present, I 
would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 259 
and YEA on Roll Call No. 260.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CON-
GRESS THAT AUGUST 30, 2021, BE 
OBSERVED AS THE 131ST ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE 1890 INSTITU-
TIONS 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduced a resolution commemorating August 
30, 2021, as the 131st anniversary of the 
1890 Institutions. This resolution celebrates 
the collaborative work the 19 historically Black 
1890 Institutions, established under the Sec-
ond Morrill Act on August 30, 1890, have un-
dertaken to address the agricultural research 
and extension needs of the country. 
Currently, the 1890 Institutions collectively 
serve over 88,000 undergraduate and grad-
uate students, and like all Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities, have given so 
much to our community and our country. 
As a proud 1890s graduate, I am honored 
to introduce this resolution, which recognizes 
the 131 years of significant and meaningful 
contributions the 1890 Institutions have made. 
These institutions are more than schools: they 
represent pathways to the middle class; 
they’re cornerstones of our communities; and 
have unlocked so much potential that our 
country has too often ignored.

DISAPPEARED OF EL SALVADOR 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, August 
30th has been designated by the United Na-
tions as The International Day of the Victims 
of Enforced Disappearance. I rise today to talk 
about the history of forced disappearance and 
its impact on individuals, families; commu-
nities, and all of society in one country, El Sal-
vador. 
Madam Speaker, I fell in love with El Sal-
vador and the Salvadoran people during very 
dark days. As a young aide to our former col-
league, Congressman Joe Moakley of Boston, 
my first trip to El Salvador was in 1983, and 
I have returned more than 30 times. 
During the civil war and afterwards, I have 
had the privilege to meet with so many Salva-
doran families throughout the country. I’ve 
often met with nuns and local priests, listened

August 27, 2021 
to them describe the daily lives of their com-
munities. They would introduce me to the peo-
ple of their parish who had lost loved ones. 
The disappeared have always been with us. 
For decades they have haunted El Salvador. 
You can hear their voices in every corner of 
the country. 
Yet in all these meetings with individuals 
and families who have suffered such great 
loss—and who still suffer—what has struck me 
most is their generosity of spirit, their courage 
and resilience, their ability to embrace mercy 
and forgiveness, seek reconciliation and de-
mand truth. 
Next year, El Salvador will celebrate the 
30th Anniversary of the Peace Accords—a 
very important milestone in El Salvador’s his-
tory—and reason for celebration, reflection 
and recommitment. But as we all know, peace 
does not come with the signing of accords. 
The work of building peace, of creating peace, 
of strengthening democratic institutions, of 
promoting reconciliation, truth and justice—all 
of that hard work begins the day the peace 
accords are signed. 
Much has been accomplished by the Salva-
doran people over these past three decades— 
but so very much is left to do. Among the 
work left unfinished is an accounting for the 
disappeared. 
The past is never simply the past—it lives in 
the present, it echoes in the daily lives of 
thousands of Salvadorans whose family mem-
bers, loved ones, friends; neighbors and col-
leagues disappeared during the civil war. 
There is nothing abstract about the suffering 
endured by these sons and daughters, these 
mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, 
brothers and sisters. They are haunted by 
memories and questions about their relatives: 
Where are they? What happened to them? 
Where are their remains? Will I ever be able 
to bury them with dignity and love? Will I ever 
know the truth? For thousands of Salvadorans 
and Salvadoran-Americans, the effects of the 
war are still felt in very real ways. 
It is no secret that the United States bears 
part of the responsibility to help find answers 
to these questions. Billions of dollars in U.S. 
military and economic aid was poured into the 
Salvadoran war. And during the twelve years 
of the war, the U.S. government tolerated ter-
rible human rights abuses. 
We 
share 
accountability 
for 
its 
con-
sequences, and we share the responsibility to 
help bind up the wounds that remain so long 
after the accords were signed. This is why I 
and so many of my colleagues in the U.S. 
Congress were so moved when we were ap-
proached in 2016 by American citizens who 
are the sons and daughters of Salvadorans 
who disappeared during the war. They asked 
us to help them in their quest to find out the 
truth about what happened to their parents. 
Working together, we asked the U.S. and 
Salvadoran governments to release all remain-
ing documents that U.S. agencies have kept 
classified on the Salvadoran civil war. On the 
U.S. side, the good news is that most U.S. 
documents were declassified and released 
during the presidency of Bill Clinton and have 
long been available to human rights research-
ers. But some documents still remain classi-
fied, mainly those of U.S. defense and intel-
ligence agencies. There’s still more that could 
be released, and I and many of my congres-
sional colleagues continue to press for further 
declassification. 
In 2010, El Salvador established a National 
Commission for the Search of Children Dis-
appeared during the Armed Conflict—or the 
CNB. The CNB seeks to investigate and de-
termine the whereabouts and situation for dis-
appeared children, including finding children 
alive and promoting their reunion with their 
families of origin. The CNB also formally insti-
tutionalized decades of work to find missing 
children and help reunite them with their Sal-
vadoran families and relatives carried out by 
my dear friend Father Jon Cortina at the Uni-
versity of Central America (UCA) Jose´ Simeo´n 
Can˜as. 
Equally as important, in 2017, the Salva-
doran government established the National 
Commission for the Search of Disappeared 
Adults in the Context of the Armed Conflict in 
El Salvador, known as Conabu´squeda. Its 
mandate is to investigate, locate, exhume, 
identify, and return the bodily remains of per-
sons disappeared at the hands of the State 
during the armed conflict. I am grateful that 
President Bukele has continued support for 
the work of each of these two critical commis-
sions. 
Forced disappearance is a crime of long- 
lasting pain and harm. Not only for the victim 
who so abruptly disappears, deprived of liberty 
and often made to suffer torture, beatings, 
rape, and other brutality before being killed 
and disposed of—but also because it affects 
the lives of their relatives and communities. 
Family members and those close to the victim 
always harbor the hope that someday they will 
meet the disappeared person again. They 
keep questions about what happened to them. 
Often faced by the denial of official authorities 
and society, the need to discover the truth and 
find closure means that the search for the 
missing is passed from grandparents to par-
ents, to their children and grandchildren for 
generations until the events surrounding a dis-
appearance are clarified. 
Last year, in August 2020, Conabu´squeda 
released a seminal study on the disappeared 
of El Salvador: Forced disappearance in the 
context of the armed conflict in El Salvador: a 
first approach to the phenomenon. The report 
described how forced disappearance was a 
repressive practice used systematically by the 
State from the 1970s onward. The report also 
made clear is that forced disappearance is not 
something that happened several decades in 
the past, it is a painful reality of the present 
that continues to affect thousands of families 
throughout El Salvador. 
Many people continue to disappear as part 
of the violence ripping apart El Salvador’s 
communities and families. According to the 
January 2021 Human Rights Watch Worldwide 
Report covering the events of 2020, from Jan-
uary 2014 to October 2019, ‘‘the Salvadoran 
police registered over 11,900 disappearance 
victims, including more than 400 children.’’ 
This exceeds the estimated 8,000 to 10,000 
disappeared during the civil war (1979–1992). 
Today’s disappearances are committed by a 
range of actors, including gangs and the po-
lice. Few cases are investigated. As in the 
past, they remain in impunity. 
How can we hope to stand up for these lat-
est victims and their families if we fail to con-
front and resolve the issue of the past dis-
appeared? The denial of past disappearance, 
the lack of cooperation by authorities to clarify 
the circumstances surrounding the forced dis-
appearances of thousands of victims in the 
past, and the failure to pursue legal action 
perpetuates the crime and the impunity that 
has always surrounded it. 
In both El Salvador and the United States, 
we must do more to support efforts to ad-
vance the search for the disappeared and pro-
vide thousands of families the closure and 
healing they have been so long denied. It is 
the right thing to do; it is the moral thing to do; 
and it is the humane thing to do.

IN MEMORY OF B. WAYNE HUGHES 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a great man, B. Wayne Hughes. Mr. 
Hughes, a prominent leader in the equine in-
dustry, lived in Lexington, Kentucky where he 
passed away on August 18, 2021. 
Mr. Hughes was born in Oklahoma in 1933 
where his father was a sharecropper. In the 
midst of the Great Depression and the Dust 
Bowl, his family moved to California when he 
was a child. After the family moved to Cali-
fornia, his father took him to Santa Anita Park 
when he was 11 years old and first introduced 
him to horseracing. He had a strong work 
ethic, delivering newspapers to help pay for 
tuition to college. He graduated from the Uni-
versity of Southern California in 1957 and 
went on to serve as an officer in the United 
States Navy. Mr. Hughes became a very suc-
cessful businessman and started companies 
including Public Storage and American Homes 
4 Rent. 
In 2002, Mr. Hughes retired as the CEO of 
Public Storage and devoted himself fully to 
horseracing. He raced his first champion in 
2003, winning the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile at 
Santa Anita. Mr. Hughes purchased Spend-
thrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky in 2004 and 
began restoring the historic 700-acre property. 
He worked diligently to make Spendthrift a 
successful breeding operation once again. 
Mr. Hughes achieved great success as a 
racehorse owner, with six Breeders’ Cup wins 
and six Eclipse Award wins. In 2020, his colt 
Authentic won the Kentucky Derby and the 
Breeders’ Cup Classic. The colt retired to stud 
and was named North America’s Horse of the 
Year for 2020. Mr. Hughes was passionate 
about the sport of horseracing and did much 
in his lifetime to improve and promote racing 
for future generations. 
Mr. Hughes is survived by his wife Patricia, 
his son Wayne Jr., and his daughter Tamara 
Gustavson. B. Wayne Hughes was a leg-
endary man who became one of horseracing’s 
most influential leaders. He will be deeply 
missed. It is my honor to recognize his life be-
fore the United States Congress.

CURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE

AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
SPEECH OF 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
Americans simply cannot afford S. Con. Res. 
14—the Biden-Sanders budget that will au-
thorize trillions of dollars in new taxes and 
spending, and I join my Republican colleagues 
in strongly opposing this irresponsible pro-
posal. 
One of the many egregious provisions in the 
Biden/Sanders budget will make conveyance 
at death of a small business or family farm to 
family members or loved ones a catastrophic 
tax event—possibly triggering a 40 percent 
death tax that must be paid immediately on 
how much the asset has appreciated. 
Shockingly, this Biden/Sanders new death 
tax would not be triggered by the sale of the 
business or family farm—instead merely taking 
ownership makes the inheritor liable for the 
new 40 percent confiscatory tax. Many of 
those who inherit would be forced to sell the 
hereditary asset just to pay the new tax. 
The author of this massive new tax and 
spend proposal, BERNIE SANDERS—Chairman 
of the Senate Budget Committee—President 
Biden and the Democratic leadership are ram-
ming this highly partisan bill through Congress 
without serious consideration of its disastrous 
impact on families and the economy. 
My constituents deserve better than this. 
When will we return to working across the 
aisle in a bipartisan way? 
After all of the suffering and economic pain 
endured by the people of my district and 
throughout the country during the COVID–19 
Pandemic, the Biden/Bernie Sanders budget: 
doubles the capital gains tax to 43.4 percent, 
raises the tax rate for many businesses—in-
cluding at least 2 million small businesses— 
from 21 to 28 percent and as I mentioned a 
moment ago imposes a major expansion of 
the ‘‘death tax’’ by taxing unrealized capital 
gains at death. 
Small businesses in particular should not 
face additional tax burdens as they struggle to 
recover from the COVID–19 pandemic. Orga-
nizations such as the New Jersey Business & 
Industry Association and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce expressed alarm at these pro-
posals, and the National Federation of Inde-
pendent Businesses stated, ‘‘increased taxes 
on small businesses mean less investment in 
employees, less investment in small busi-
nesses, and less economic growth.’’ 
According to the Senate Republican leader-
ship on the Budget Committee, the reckless 
tax and spend plan includes: $4.2 trillion in 
new spending over 10 years; $3.5 trillion in 
new mandatory spending; $263 billion in new 
discretionary spending, and $390 billion in in-
creased interest on the debt. 
National debt soars to $40 trillion (119 per-
cent of GDP) by 2031. 
Total debt (subject to limit) soars to $45 tril-
lion (134 percent of GDP) by 2031. 
Nearly $400 billion in defense cuts com-
pared to current law projections. 
Deficits that average $1.6 trillion annually 
under the plan, reaching $2.2 trillion by 2031. 
According to supporting documents provided 
by Chairman SANDERS, the $3.5 trillion reck-
less tax and spend spree will be ‘‘fully offset.’’ 
Because the Finance Committee was given a 
broad reconciliation instruction that did not re-
quire or disclose a specific level of revenue, 
this can be accomplished entirely by raising 
$3.5 trillion in new truces. There is no restric-
tion on the amount of tax increases allowed 
under this budget resolution or through the 
fast-track reconciliation process. 
Especially in New Jersey, one of the highest 
taxed states in the Nation, taxpayers need re-
lief, not the massive taxes that will be levied 
to pay for this Biden/Sanders budget bill.

REMEMBERING CHERYL TEAMER 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA

Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and mourn con-
stituent, activist, public servant, lawyer, busi-
nesswoman and dear friend, Cheryl Teamer. 
She died this weekend at the age of 58. 
A native of New Orleans, she earned her 
law degree at Tulane University and worked to 
get things done in City Hall in Mayor Marc 
Morial’s administration. 
She then worked in government relations 
and founded her own consultancy and advis-
ing firm. 
We all knew her for her incredible ability to 
multitask 20 different things at the same time, 
and to do it with a sense of joy. 
She built relationships and bridges between 
people of all backgrounds and walks of life. 
She loved to be in the thick of it—whatever 
was happening. 
Cheryl Teamer was accomplished, kind, big- 
hearted and rooted in the New Orleans com-
munity. 
She will be deeply missed. Rest easy, my 
friend.

ture, is now just young at heart, but in Bill 
Clinton it produced one of the nation’s great-
est presidents. 
As President, Bill Clinton, the ‘‘Man From 
Hope,’’ always put our people first and led our 
Nation to unrivaled heights of shared pros-
perity for all, unmatched progress in becoming 
‘one Nation unified,’ and brought peace to Ire-
land, freedom to the people of Kosovo, res-
cued the economy of Mexico from destruction, 
and led America to the leadership position in 
the emerging globalized economy of the 21st 
Century. Madam Speaker, if anyone wants to 
know 
the 
true 
meaning 
of 
‘‘American 
Exceptionalism’’ all they have to do is examine 
the years 1993 through 2001 when President 
Bill Clinton commanded the ship of state. 
Under President Clinton, the United States 
enjoyed the longest economic expansion in 
American history. The President’s strategy of 
fiscal discipline, opening foreign markets, and 
investments in the American people helped 
create the conditions for a record 115 months 
of economic expansion and our economy grew 
at an average of 4 percent per year during the 
years of his presidency. More than 22 million 
jobs were created in less than eight years— 
the most ever under a single administration, 
and more than were created in the previous 
twelve years. We enjoyed the highest home-
ownership in American history because the 
strong Clinton economy and fiscal discipline 
kept interest rates low, making it possible for 
more families to buy homes, and the home-
ownership rate increased from 64.2 percent in 
1992 to 67.7 percent, the highest rate ever. 
We had the lowest unemployment in 30 years. 
Unemployment dropped from more than 7 per-
cent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 
2000. Unemployment for African Americans 
and Hispanics fell to the lowest rates on 
record, and the rate for women was the lowest 
in more than 40 years. 
Between 1993 and 2001, reading and math 
scores increased for 4th, 8th, and 12th grad-
ers, and math SAT scores reached a 30-year 
high, 49 states put in place standards in core 
subjects, and federal investment in education 
and training doubled. During the Clinton Ad-
ministration financial aid for students was 
nearly doubled by increasing Pell Grants to 
the largest award ever, expanding Federal 
Work-Study to allow 1 million students to work 
their way through college, and by creating new 
tax credits and scholarships, such as Lifetime 
Learning tax credits and the HOPE scholar-
ship. At the same time, taxpayers saved $18 
billion due to the decline in student loan de-
faults, increased collections and savings from 
the direct student loan program. 
President Clinton and Vice President Gore’s 
commitment to education technology, including 
the E-Rate and a 3,000 percent increase in 
educational technology funding, increased the 
percentage of schools connected to the Inter-
net from 35 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in 
1999. Because of President Clinton’s com-
prehensive anti-crime strategy of smart pre-
vention, more police, as well as commonsense 
gun safety laws, the overall crime rate de-
clined for 8 consecutive years, the longest 
continuous drop on record, and was at the 
lowest level since 1973. As part of the 1994 
Crime Bill, President Clinton enacted a new 
initiative to fund 100,000 community police of-
ficers in more than 11,000 law enforcement 
agencies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E932 
August 27, 2021 
Since the President signed the Brady bill in 
1993, stopping more than 600,000 felons, fugi-
tives, and other prohibited persons from buy-
ing guns, gun crime declined 40 percent dur-
ing his years in office. 
President Clinton signed into law the Family 
and Medical Leave Act in 1993, which enabled 
more than 20 million Americans to take leave 
to care for a newborn child or sick family 
member without fear of losing their job. Presi-
dent Clinton pledged to end welfare as we 
know it and signed landmark bipartisan wel-
fare reform legislation in 1996. As a result of 
the booming economy and welcoming job 
market, welfare caseloads were cut in half, to 
the lowest level since 1968, millions of parents 
joined the workforce, and ‘‘welfare is no longer 
a political issue to be exploited by dema-
gogues, as people on welfare today were five 
times more likely to b working in 2000 than in 
1992. After falling by nearly $2,000 between 
1988 and 1992, the median income for fami-
lies rose by $6,338, after adjusting for inflation 
during the Clinton years. In that same time, 
African-American family income increased 
even more, rising by nearly $7,000 since 
1993. 
After years of stagnant income growth 
among average and lower income families, all 
income 
brackets 
experienced 
double-digit 
growth since 1993, with the bottom quintile en-
joying the largest income growth at 16.3 per-
cent. Because Congress passed President 
Clinton’s Economic Plan in 1993, the poverty 
rate declined from 15.1 percent to 11.8 per-
cent—the largest six-year drop in poverty in 
nearly 30 years. In 2000, there were seven 
million fewer people in poverty than when 
President Clinton took office in 1993. The child 
poverty rate declined more than 25 percent, 
the poverty rates for single mothers, African 
Americans, and the elderly had dropped to 
their lowest levels on record, and Hispanic 
poverty dropped to its lowest level since 1979. 
In his 1995 State of the Union Address, Presi-
dent Clinton challenged Americans to join to-
gether in a national campaign against teen 
pregnancy, which resulted in the birth rate for 
teens aged 15–19 declining every year of the 
Clinton Presidency, from 60.7 per 1,000 teens 
in 1992 to a record low of 49.6 in 1999. 
Because the Clinton Administration ex-
panded efforts to provide mothers and new-
born children with healthcare, a record high 82 
percent of all mothers were receiving prenatal 
care by the time he left office and the infant 
mortality rate dropped from 8.5 deaths per 
1,000 in 1992 to 7.2 deaths per 1,000 in 1998, 
the lowest rate ever recorded. 
The accomplishments of President Clinton 
were just as impressive in the field of national 
security and foreign affairs. President Clinton 
understood from the beginning of his presi-
dency that the most pervasive force in our 
world is globalization and he understood that 
while globalization is inexorable, its benefits 
must be harnessed to advance our objectives 
of democracy, shared prosperity and peace. 
Under the visionary leadership of President 
Clinton, America exercised its influence by 
building with its democratic partners an inter-
national system of strong alliances and institu-
tions attuned to the challenges of a globalized 
world, by ensuring this system is genuinely 
open to all who adhere to clearly defined 
standards, and by being ready to stand up for 
those standards when they are threatened. 
After the absence of such leadership the last 
four years, is it not wonderful that the Adminis-
tration of President Biden also understands 
that the power of America’s example carries 
more influence than examples of America’s 
power. But let us get back to the story of 
spectacular leadership and spectacular re-
sults. 
The Clinton-Gore Administration led the 
international effort to dismantle more than 
1,700 nuclear warheads, 300 launchers and 
425 land and submarine-based missiles from 
the former Soviet Union. 
President Clinton led the revitalization, ad-
aptation, and expansion of NATO from a static 
Cold War alliance to a magnet for new democ-
racies, with new partners, members and mis-
sions; adapted its command structure; admit-
ted Hungary; Poland and the Czech Republic; 
and created the Partnership for Peace. Presi-
dent Clinton led NATO in its first military en-
gagement and stopped the killing in Bosnia, 
brokered the peace in the Dayton Accords, 
leading to a sustained civil society complete 
with active opposition parties an non-govern-
mental organizations and national and local 
elections taking place throughout the country. 
As Commander in Chief, President Clinton 
took military action in Kosovo to stop geno-
cide, ethnic cleansing, and regional instability, 
forcing the withdrawal of Serb forces, dis-
banding the Kosovo Liberation Army, and de-
ploying an international presence in Kosovo— 
with a 47,000 strong NATO-led force providing 
security for the province, resulting in the safe 
and unconditional return of over 900,000 refu-
gees. Under President Clinton, nuclear weap-
ons and their delivery vehicles were perma-
nently eliminated from Ukraine, Belarus and 
Kazakhstan and the Comprehensive Nuclear 
Test Ban Treaty was signed; in addition, the 
indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and ratification of the Chemical Weap-
ons Convention was achieved. 
Under President Clinton, the perpetrators of 
the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and 
CIA killings were brought to justice and the 
planned terrorist attacks against Millennium 
celebrations were foiled. President Clinton de-
veloped a national counter-terrorism strategy, 
led by a national coordinator, and the Nation’s 
first national strategy to protect critical infra-
structure, and increased funding on critical in-
frastructure Protection by over 40 percent 
since 1998. An admirer of Nelson Mandela, a 
student of his teachings, and a true friend of 
Africa and the Caribbean, President Clinton 
was the second American President to visit 
sub-Sahara Africa, following President Jimmy 
Carter’s visit to Lagos, Nigeria in 1978. 
As President, Bill Clinton launched and won 
approval for the African Growth and Oppor-
tunity Act to support increased trade and in-
vestment between the United States and Afri-
ca, strengthen African economies and demo-
cratic governments, increase partnerships to 
counter terrorism, crime, environmental deg-
radation and disease, and for the Caribbean 
Basin Initiative enhancement legislation to pro-
mote economic prosperity in Central America 
and the Caribbean. 
Madam Speaker, between 1998 and 2000, 
the national debt was reduced by $363 bil-
lion—the largest three-year debt pay-down in 
American history and we were on track to pay 
off the entire debt by 2009 until the fiscal mis-
management of the succeeding administration. 
President Clinton converted the largest budget 
deficit in American history to the largest sur-
plus in history; the deficit was $290 billion in 
1993 and was expected to grow to $455 billion 
by 1998 but instead, thanks to the leadership 
of President Clinton, the United States had a 
surplus of $237 billion. 
In the area of the great outdoors and the 
environment, it should be noted that President 
Clinton protected more land in the lower 48 
states than any other president, protecting 5 
new national parks, designating 11 new na-
tional monuments, and expanding two others 
and proposing protections for 60 million acres 
of roadless areas in America’s national for-
ests. 
During the Clinton years, federal govern-
ment spending as a share of the economy had 
decreased from 22.2 percent in 1992 to a pro-
jected 18.5 percent in 2000, the lowest since 
1966. On a related note, Americans enjoyed 
the lowest federal income tax burden in 35 
years under President Clinton, who enacted 
targeted tax cuts such as the Earned Income 
Tax Credit expansion, $500 child tax credit, 
and the HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime 
Learning Tax Credits. 
As a candidate, President Clinton pledged 
that he would have a government ‘‘that looks 
like the American people,’’ and he made true 
on that commitment and then some. President 
Clinton appointed more African Americans, 
women and Hispanics to the Cabinet than any 
other President in history; he appointed the 
first female Attorney General, the first female 
Secretary of State and the first Asian-Amer-
ican cabinet secretary ever. 
Under his Administration, the outright ban 
on gays serving in the military was ended and 
the military’s policy of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ 
worked so well in allowing LGBTQ service 
personnel to demonstrate their talents and 
skills that the policy would later be found to be 
unnecessary and discarded altogether. 
Madam Speaker, I have laid out the major 
reasons why Americans are so appreciative 
that Bill Clinton served as the 42nd President 
of the United States, especially for his healing 
words and actions during the time of the tragic 
and horrific April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing 
at the Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building that 
killed 168 persons, including 19 children, and 
wounded more than 800 others. And as he 
pledged to the Nation he would, the terrorists 
who perpetrated this heinous act were brought 
to justice and punished in accordance with the 
law. 
We Democrats thank President Clinton for 
all that but for much more. Bill Clinton was the 
unparalleled visionary Democratic political 
leader of the latter half of the 20th Century. In 
the presidential election preceding his, the 
Democratic candidate was beaten in the Elec-
toral College 426–112, losing 40 states, and 
trailing in the popular vote by 7.8 percentage 
points and 7 million votes. In the presidential 
election before that, 1984, the Democratic 
candidate lost 49 of 50 states, lost the Elec-
toral College 525–13, and lost the popular 
vote by 18.2 percentage points and 16.8 mil-
lion votes. The electoral map and political out-
look were bleak for the Governor of the ‘‘small 
southern state of Arkansas’’ but he would not 
be deterred and would not be outworked and 
did not waver in his conviction that his pro-
gressive policies promising shared prosperity 
and his inclusive vision in which the United 
States ‘‘did not have a person to waste’’ would 
attract majority support. 
Madam Speaker, because of the remarkable 
leadership and success role-modeled by

CELEBRATING 250 YEARS OF THE 
JOHN CORBLY MEMORIAL BAP-
TIST CHURCH 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the John Corbly Memorial 
Baptist Church and congratulate them on serv-
ing God and western Pennsylvania for 250 
years. 
Originally called Goshen Baptist Church, 
what would become John Corbly Memorial 
Baptist Church consisted of two congrega-
tions. Meetings were held as early as 1769 on 
Muddy Creek and 1770 on Big Whiteley 
Creek. In April 1771, their first log meeting 
house was erected on Big Whiteley Creek in 
Garards Fort. 
The congregation’s first brick structure was 
completed in 1843, with the first service held 
on December 9 of that year. On February 24, 
1907, a motion was made to rename the 
church in honor of John Corbly, the church’s 
founder and former minister. 
John Corbly was an Irish immigrant and 
prominent early settler of southwestern Penn-
sylvania. In, 1747, at 14, he started his life in 
the New World and was apprenticed to a 
Pennsylvania Quaker family. At the end of his 
term of indentured servitude, Corbly settled in 
Winchester, Virginia, and found God. 
In Virginia, Corbly met Elder John Garrard, 
an emerging Baptist preacher in the area. He 
converted soon after their first encounter and 
became a reverend. His subsequent preaching 
was so impassioned and effective that it led to 
persecution 
from 
other 
Virginia 
religious 
groups. Reverend Corbly was consequently 
imprisoned for his beliefs. 
Following 
his 
imprisonment, 
Reverend 
Corbly settled near Whiteley Creek with other 
Baptists. While he planned to practice his reli-
gion in peace, our nation’s war for independ-
ence began and Reverend Corbly enlisted to 
fight, ultimately aiding in the founding of our 
nation. 
After the Revolutionary War, Reverend 
Corbly returned home to raise his family and 
preach. Sadly, in May 1782, his wife and three 
children were killed on their way to church. 
Despite the incredible emotional toll, Reverend 
Corbly continued to preach and established 30 
Baptist churches in Pennsylvania, West Vir-
ginia, and Kentucky before his death in 1803. 
Madam Speaker, the story of the John 
Corbly Memorial Baptist Church is uniquely 
American. 
Their 
founder 
and 
original 
congregants endured religious persecution, 
the American Revolution, and the hardships of 
frontier life, yet maintained their commitment 
to the Gospel. The church has stood as a tes-
tament to their faith for 250 years and I look 
forward to what the next chapter has in store 
for their congregation and community.

RECOGNIZING 
ROBERT 
MAJOR 
STAFFORD FOR HIS SERVICE TO 
THE UNITED STATES 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Robert Major Stafford, who 
devoted his life to serving our country and his 
community. Through his tireless work ethic 
and dedication, Robert has left a lasting effect 
on those he helped in both the military and his 
community. 
Regardless of Robert’s multiple life-altering 
injuries, he has consistently served the public 
with honor and is an amazing role model for 
his community. After suffering a partial loss of 
sight at a young age, Robert was ineligible to 
be deployed overseas. This did not stand in 
his way of pursuing a life of service, and Rob-
ert went on to be stationed at both Camp Ellis 
and Camp Grant in the 1940s. During his time 
there, he worked at the hospital caring for pa-
tients, managed a bowling alley, and worked 
at Caterpillar making belly pans for U.S. Army 
tanks. Even with his partial loss of sight, he 
was awarded the marksman badge for his in-
credible shooting accuracy and received the 
rank of TEC 5 during his time in the Army. 
Following his service, he and his wife, Dorothy 
Wills, moved to the Upper Peninsula and 
raised eleven children in Iron River, Michigan. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constitu-
ents, I ask you to join me in honoring the serv-
ice of Robert Major Stafford. Michiganders can 
take great pride in knowing their state is home 
to such a selfless leader.

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER 
REPRESENTATIVE 
DOUG APPLEGATE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a fine gentleman who was not 
just a former colleague, but also a fellow 
Buckeye, and a dear friend. 
Congressman Doug Applegate of Steuben-
ville, Ohio, served nine terms in the House 
from 1977 until 1994. Sadly, Doug passed 
away on August 7 at the age of 93. 
For nearly two decades, Representative Ap-
plegate ably and honorably represented east-
ern Ohio’s 18th Congressional District. He and 
his beloved wife Betty were indefatigable in 
their fierce advocacy for their constituents. 
Doug was particularly gifted in his representa-
tion of his industrial and mining region and his 
advocacy for the steelworkers, coal miners, 
and veterans who called their shared Appa-
lachian region ‘‘home.’’ I can recall travelling 
to Steubenville and viewing the industry that 
propelled its economy atop the Ohio river 33 
miles from Pittsburgh. 
Doug served as a Member and then chair of 
the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Com-
pensation, Veterans, and Insurance. He never 
stopped championing their cause. Representa-
tive Applegate was responsible for passing a 
$150 a month benefit increase for World War 
I pensioners and their spouses. 
He also fought for raises in disability and 
other allowances and benefits that improved 
the quality of life for our heroic members in 
uniform. 
When I was first elected to Congress and 
achieved appointment to the House Veterans 
Affairs Committee, I remember the poignant 
debate about Agent Orange and why Vietnam 
veterans should receive medical eligibility at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs for diag-
nosis and treatment of illnesses, including soft 
tissue cancers, they were developing due to 
exposure to Agent Orange. Long debate oc-
curred in the Committee at that time as to who 
then this was possibly afflicting because irref-
utable scientific studies had not been com-
pleted at that point in time. Doug Applegate 
turned the debate to positive support of Viet-
nam veterans self-examining themselves to 
determine their medical conditions by saying 
‘‘There is a difference between what is sci-
entifically provable and morally right.’’ From 
that point onward, the VA covered Agent Or-
ange diagnostic tests and treatments for Agent 
Orange. Doug Applegate never yielded when 
it came to America’s veterans and he stood 
his ground. 
Toward the end of his career, he was instru-
mental in ensuring Veterans Affairs became a 
department-level agency—allowing our heroes 
to receive the attention and care they deserve. 
I also vividly remember his scorching de-
nunciation of unfair trade policies, such as 
when he introduced legislation in 1986 to pun-
ish countries skirting steel import rules and 
harming American workers. He was a fighter 
for the working pension and the middle class. 
I miss his passion in these chambers. 
As his tenure drew to a close, Representa-
tive Applegate was praised by his colleagues 
and constituents for his work to secure hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for 
Ohio, and the diligence he displayed in serv-
ing the residents of the 18th District. 
While many today did not have the privilege 
of working alongside Representative Doug Ap-
plegate, he provides a model for us all to fol-
low on behalf of the people of Ohio. I thank 
him for his honorable and faithful service, and 
offer my deepest condolences to his family, 
loved ones, and the constituents to whom he 
dedicated his best years. May the angels carry 
him close to his beloved Betty.

HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th birthday of Ms. Sue 
Lott. Throughout her life, Ms. Lott has seen 18 
different presidents and many changes in the 
world. Growing up during the Great Depres-
sion, Ms. Lott learned the importance of sim-
plicity and hard work, where many of her days 
were spent tying strings around June bugs for 
fun and picking butter beans with her sister to 
trade for ice cream. Other days, she would

work with her family all day to make a mere 
50 cents. Ms. Lott worked as a seamstress as 
she grew older, and during World War II, she 
was one of many women who kept the country 
going while the men served in the war. She 
worked for many years at Regal Mills, sewing 
diapers. 
Although Ms. Lott never had her own chil-
dren, her many nieces and nephews and 
members of the community consider her to be 
a mother and grandmother. She is an active 
member of Providence Baptist Church in 
Hodges, SC, and her love for others and the 
Lord radiates around her wherever she goes. 
Ms. Lott loves to cook, garden, and read a 
good book. Throughout the isolation of the 
pandemic, Ms. Lott’s main source of joy and 
comfort was reading. She lived most of her 
adult life in Greenwood, SC, and has since re-
turned to her birthplace, as a resident of 
Saluda Nursing Home. Her impact is seen ev-
erywhere in the community, and I am proud to 
represent and serve constituents as impactful 
as those like Ms. Sue Lott. 
On behalf of the Third District of South 
Carolina, I would like to wish Ms. Sue Lott a 
very happy 100th birthday and thank her for 
her many dedicated years to our community.

HONORING CARLA BROWN 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a member of the 
Baton Rouge community. 
Nurse Carla Brown has been going door to 
door in her ‘‘clinic on wheels,’’—her car—pro-
viding COVID vaccinations. 
As of now, she and her partners have vac-
cinated over 2,000 people. 
To Mrs. Brown, this fight is personal. 
Her husband David died from COVID–19 
after weeks on a ventilator. 
He was a two-time cancer survivor. He sur-
vived a gunshot wound to the face. 
But COVID was what took his life. 
Since then, Nurse Brown has turned her 
grief into action, using her time off to provide 
vaccination house calls to underserved com-
munities like North Baton Rouge. 
Louisiana has one of the lowest vaccination 
rates in the country, so her work is truly sav-
ing lives. 
Mrs. Brown tells people, ‘‘If there were a 
vaccine when my David was alive, he would 
be here.’’ 
I thank Carla Brown for her service to our 
community. 
To all Americans, please hear this brave 
nurse’s message: Get vaccinated.

AWARD 
OF 
CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO PRESI-
DENT LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON 
FOR 
HIS 
EXTRAORDINARY 
RECORD 
OF 
ACHIEVEMENT 
IN 
THE FIELD OF DOMESTIC AF-
FAIRS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in remembrance of one of the true giants of 
American history and politics, Lyndon Baines 
Johnson, the 36th President of the United 
States, who was born 113 years ago today, 
August 27. It might be fair to say that I have 
quoted the wise words of President Abraham 
Lincoln on this floor perhaps more than any 
other Member and my appreciation and pro-
found gratitude for leadership of President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who led our coun-
try out of the Great Depression and into an 
economic and military superpower, to victory 
in World War II, and whose New Deal trans-
formed the way Americans live and work for 
the better, is unsurpassed. 
But next to these two greatest of all Amer-
ican presidents, in my view shared by millions, 
stands Lyndon Baines Johnson, the visionary 
and architect of the Great Society, which cen-
tered federal policy on the growth and human 
development of the individual, providing edu-
cational and economic opportunity to all per-
sons of all races, genders, and creeds living in 
every rural and urban community in every re-
gion of the nation. As I will discuss, the ac-
claimed Pulitzer Prize winner and preeminent 
historian and biographer, Robert Caro, is ex-
actly right when he wrote that with the single 
exception of Abraham Lincoln, Lyndon John-
son was the greatest champion of the poor 
and underprivileged in the history of the Re-
public and was the President ‘‘who wrote 
mercy and justice into the statute books by 
which America was governed.’’ 
That is why earlier this year I introduced 
H.R. 115, legislation awarding the Congres-
sional Gold Medal to President Lyndon Baines 
Johnson, whose vision and leadership secured 
passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 
1965, the Social Security Amendments Act 
(Medicare) of 1965, the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, the Higher Education Act of 1965, the 
Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, to 
name just a handful of the more than 180 laws 
that have done so much to shape American 
society in the 21st Century. The awarding of 
the Congressional Gold Medal is long overdue 
recognition of the remarkable record of 
achievement in the field of domestic affairs of 
the person most responsible for several of the 
nation’s landmark laws that mark their 56th 
anniversary this year. 
Madam Speaker, as a Member of Congress 
from the Tenth Congressional District of 
Texas, as Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate, 
Vice President and President of the United 
States, Lyndon Baines Johnson’s domestic ac-
complishments in the fields of civil rights, edu-
cation, and economic opportunity rank among 
the greatest achievements of the past century. 
As President, Lyndon Johnson proposed, 
championed, led to passage, and signed into 
law on August 6, 1965 the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, which swept away barriers impeding 
millions of Americans from meaningful partici-
pation in American political life. On July 30, 
1965, President Johnson signed into law the 
Social Security Amendments Act of 1965, 
which we today know as Medicare, which has 
transformed the delivery of health care in the 
United States and which, along with Social 
Security, reduced the rate of poverty among 
the elderly from 28.5 percent in 1966 to 9.1 
percent in 2012. 
On July 2, 1964 President Johnson secured 
passage and signed into law the most sweep-
ing civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits 
discrimination in employment, education, and 
public accommodations based on race, color, 
religion, or national origin. 
On November 8, 1965, President Johnson 
signed into law the Higher Education Act, 
which provided need-based financial aid to 
students in the form of scholarships, work- 
study grants, and loans, and thus for the first 
time made higher education more accessible 
to populations of persons who were previously 
unable to attend college because of economic 
circumstances. 
On October 3, 1965, President Johnson 
signed into law the Immigration and Natu-
ralization Act of 1965, which transformed the 
nation’s immigration system by abolishing the 
racially based quota system that had defined 
American immigration policy for the previous 
four decades and replaced it with a policy 
whose central purpose was family reunifica-
tion, with a preference for immigrants with 
specific skillsets. 
Madam Speaker, Lyndon Baines Johnson 
began his working life as a teacher and de-
bate coach in the poor Hispanic community in 
the South Texas town of Cotulla, where pov-
erty was so bad that he recalled seeing ‘‘Mexi-
can children going through a garbage pile, 
shaking the coffee grounds from the grapefruit 
rinds and sucking the rinds for the juice that 
was left, a sight he never forgot, and which 
fueled his passion and commitment to ending 
poverty in America. This teacher who became 
president served his country in numerous, dis-
tinguished ways, including as Lt. Commander 
in the U.S. Navy during World War II, as a 
Member of both houses of Congress, as Vice 
President of the United States, and as the 
36th President of the United States. Lyndon 
Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 
1908, in Stonewall, Texas. 
In 1927, he enrolled in Southwest Texas 
State Teachers College at San Marcos, Texas 
(Texas State University-San Marcos) and 
graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree 
in August 1930. After graduation he taught at 
Pearsall High School in Pearsall, Texas, and 
taught public speaking at Sam Houston High 
School in Houston, Texas, where in the spring 
of 1931, his debate team won the district 
championship. In a special election in 1937, 
Johnson won the U.S. House of Representa-
tives seat representing the 10th Congressional 
District of Texas, defeating nine other can-
didates, and would be re-elected to a full term 
in the 76th Congress and to each succeeding 
Congress until 1948. 
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on De-
cember 7, 1941, Johnson became the first 
Member of Congress to volunteer for active 
duty in the armed forces (U.S. Navy), report-
ing for active duty on December 9, 1941. 
Johnson received the Silver Star from General

Douglas MacArthur for gallantry in action dur-
ing an aerial combat mission over hostile posi-
tions in New Guinea on June 9, 1942. Presi-
dent Roosevelt ordered all Members of Con-
gress in the armed forces to return to their of-
fices, and Johnson was released from active 
duty on July 16, 1942. In 1948, after a cam-
paign in which he traveled by ‘newfangled’ 
helicopter all over the state, Johnson won the 
primary by 87 votes and earning the nickname 
‘Landslide Lyndon’ and went on to victory in 
the general election, where he served until in-
augurated Vice-President of the United States 
on January 20, 1961. 
As a member of the Senate, Lyndon John-
son is acknowledged by historians, scholars, 
and students of politics as the greatest Major-
ity Leader in the history of that chamber. Lyn-
don Johnson became the 36th President of 
the United States on November 22, 1963, 
after the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy. During his administration, education 
was one of the many areas where President 
Johnson blazed new ground, proposing nu-
merous education initiatives which became 
landmark education bills he signed into law. In 
1963, President Johnson signed the Higher 
Education Facilities Act (P.L. 88–204) which 
authorized a five-year program of federal 
grants and loans for construction or improve-
ment of public and private higher education 
academic facilities. This legislation was the 
largest education program enacted by Con-
gress since the National Defense Education 
Act of 1958, and itwas the first broad edu-
cation bill enacted in the post-World War II pe-
riod that was not tied to national defense. 
In 1964, Johnson signed the Library Serv-
ices Act (P.L. 88–269) to make high quality 
public libraries more accessible to both urban 
and rural residents. The funds made available 
under this Act were used to construct as well 
as operate libraries, and to extend this pro-
gram to cities as well as rural areas. Later that 
year, President Johnson signed the Civil 
Rights Act (P.L. 88–352), which included Title 
VI among its landmark provisions authorizing 
federal authorities to sue for the desegregation 
of schools and to withhold federal funds from 
education institutions that practiced segrega-
tion. In 1965, in the presence of his first teach-
er, Mrs. Kathryn Deadrich Loney, President 
Johnson signed the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act (P.L. 89–10) at the 
former Junction Elementary School in Stone-
wall, Texas, where he first attended school. 
This legislation was the first general aid-to- 
education program ever adopted by Congress, 
and it provided programs to help educate dis-
advantaged children in urban and rural areas. 
Later that year, he also signed the Higher 
Education Act (P.L. 89–329), which was the 
first program approved by the U.S. Congress 
for scholarships to undergraduate students. In 
1965, President Johnson launched Project 
Head Start, as an eight-week summer pro-
gram, to help break the cycle of poverty by 
providing pre-school children from low-income 
families with a comprehensive program to 
meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, 
and psychological needs. Recruiting children 
from ages three to school-entry age, Head 
Start was enthusiastically received by edu-
cation and child development specialists, com-
munity leaders, and parents across the nation. 
Currently, Head Start continues to serve chil-
dren and their families each year in urban and 
rural areas in all 50 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories, 
as well as many migrant children. In 1966, 
President Johnson signed the International 
Education Act (P.L. 89–698), which promoted 
international studies at U.S. colleges and uni-
versities. 
In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act Amendments of 1967 
(P.L. 90–247), establishing bilingual education 
programs for non-English speaking children, 
and providing more funds for special edu-
cation for disabled children. Later that year, he 
also signed the Handicapped Children’s Early 
Education Assistance Act (P.L. 90–538), which 
authorized experimental programs for disabled 
children of preschool age. In 1965, President 
Johnson achieved passage of the greatest 
legislative achievement for the cause of civil 
rights and equality of opportunity, the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discrimina-
tion in voting, thus allowing millions of south-
ern black Americans to vote for the very first 
time. In other actions on the civil rights front, 
President Johnson nominated civil rights attor-
ney Thurgood Marshall to the positions of So-
licitor General and later Associate Justice of 
the Supreme Court, making him the first Afri-
can American to serve in either capacity. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a 
document entitled the ‘‘The Legislative Legacy 
of President Lyndon Baines Johnson: 1963– 
1968,’’ to remind all Members and the Nation 
what can be accomplished under the leader-
ship of one who had a servant’s heart, an iron 
will, and as the famed biographer Robert Caro 
memorably characterized it, ‘‘a natural genius 
for politics.’’ I invite all Members to join me in 
sponsoring H.R. 115, legislation awarding the 
Congressional Gold Medal and recognizing 
the extraordinary domestic achievements of 
President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the 36th 
President of the United States.

RECOGNIZING 
JAMES 
MOUSALIMAS 
FOR 
HIS 
DEDI-
CATED PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 27, 2021 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing James 
Mousalimas for his dedicated service to our 
community and congratulating him on his re-
tirement after 35 years in education. 
James found his passion for education dur-
ing his time as a Peace Corps Volunteer in 
Niger, West Africa, where he was a teacher 
and basketball coach. Following this experi-
ence, he taught math in Richmond Unified 
School District and then embarked overseas 
to become a teacher, assistant principal, and 
eventually the principal of an American Inter-
national School in Saudi Arabia. 
In 1998, James returned to the United 
States and served as Coordinator of Year- 
Round Education for Tracy Unified School Dis-
trict. Shortly thereafter, he became the Direc-
tor of Alterative Programs for Tracy Unified 
School District. In 2008, James joined the San 
Joaquin County Office of Education (SJCOE) 
as Assistant Superintendent of County Oper-
ated Schools and Programs. 
James was elected as the San Joaquin 
County Superintendent of Schools in 2014 and 
again in 2018. During his tenure as Super-
intendent of Schools, James brought visionary 
ideas to fruition, expanding and adding new 
services to meet the needs of students, fami-
lies, and our community. From advancing 
STEM education to furthering adult learning, 
James worked tirelessly to ensure the success 
of SJCOE schools and programs including the 
Greater Valley Conservation Corps, Come 
Back Kids, Teachers College of San Joaquin, 
CodeStack 
Academy, 
and 
the 
SJCOE 
FabLab. 
James has made invaluable contributions to 
our community, and his leadership has made 
a positive impact on countless students. He 
was instrumental in the opening of the Dis-
covery Challenge Academy in San Joaquin 
County, which helps students who traditionally 
would have fallen through the cracks and al-
lows them to earn high school credits, develop 
leadership, job skills, and academic skills 
while improving self-esteem, pride, and con-
fidence. Additionally, James oversaw the tran-
sition to online learning during the COVID–19 
pandemic to keep students, teachers, and 
educators safe. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing James Mousalimas for his distinguished 
service and in wishing him a happy, well-de-
served retirement.
