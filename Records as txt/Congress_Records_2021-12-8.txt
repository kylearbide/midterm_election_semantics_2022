PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord our shepherd, how wonderful 
it is to be found by You. When we stray 
from Your Word or wander from the 
shelter of Your tender care, You seek 
us out. 
There is nowhere You won’t go to 
look for us. You who know our every 
thought, every desire, every decision, 
our every move, You have shown time 
and again that You will pursue us until 
we come back to You, our creator, re-
deemer, and friend. 
May we be willing to be found today. 
May we hear Your Words before we 
speak. May we know Your desires be-
fore we make our plans. May we feel 
Your presence before we take off on our 
own. And may we receive the embrace 
of Your love before we engage with our 
family, friends, colleagues, and strang-
ers. 
Wherever we are today, O God, find 
us, wrap us in Your tender embrace and 
bring us back to the fold and restore us 
to the life that You intend for us. 
In Your merciful name, we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
LIEUTENANT GARRETT RAMOS 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the life of 
Lieutenant Garrett Ramos of Sterling, 
Illinois. Thirty-eight-year-old Lieuten-
ant Ramos served the Sterling Fire De-
partment for a decade before losing his 
life late last week. 
Late Friday night in Rock Falls, Illi-
nois, Lieutenant Ramos responded to a 
call for help. As he was bravely fight-
ing a house fire, the floor collapsed be-
neath 
him. 
But 
while 
Lieutenant 
Ramos’ life was cut short, his memory 
will live on. 
Described as an amazing individual of 
the highest caliber on and off duty, 
Lieutenant Ramos carried on his fam-
ily’s legacy of service when he became 
a firefighter, just like his father. 
Lieutenant Garrett Ramos was a 
good man, a good firefighter, a good 
friend, and a good Cubs fan. But above 
all else, he was a son, a husband, and a 
father to two little children who will 
dearly miss him. 
He was a true hero to the community 
he served. The community is asked to 
put a red light on their porch in honor 
of Lieutenant Garrett Ramos. 
My deepest condolences to his loved 
ones. May they be comforted by his 
memory. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MAYOR ANTHONY 
WILLIAMS 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate 
my friend, Mayor Anthony Williams, 
on 20 years of excellence in public serv-
ice to the Key City, Abilene, Texas. 
Mayor Williams has grown up, re-
ceived his education, and raised his 
family in the Key City community his 
entire life. Anthony has dedicated his 
life to public service and has had a tre-
mendous impact on the community 
that he dearly loves. 
Mayor Williams’ record reflects that 
he believes that a thriving community 
stems from a free and responsible citi-
zenry, strong faith and families, and a 
growing economy. 
A big country, west Texas thank you, 
Mr. Speaker, to his wife, Lynette, and 
their four children for their sacrifice 
for giving him the leeway to spend 
time in the community and make Abi-
lene a better place to live for all of us. 
I thank Mayor Williams for being a 
great friend, brother in Christ, and 
partner in our public service venture 
for liberty and prosperity for all Amer-
icans. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate An-
thony. God bless him and his family. 
And go West Texas.

CELEBRATING FRED GRAY’S 91ST 
BIRTHDAY 
(Ms. SEWELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor a true American hero and one of 
our Nation’s most distinguished civil 
rights lawyers, Attorney Fred Gray, 
Sr., as he celebrates his 91st birthday 
on December 14, 2021. 
A native of Alabama’s Seventh Con-
gressional District, Attorney Gray was 
born in Montgomery, Alabama, and 
came of age during the height of the 
Jim Crow segregation era. 
One of Alabama’s first Black lawyers, 
he 
successfully 
litigated 
groundbreaking civil rights cases, rep-
resenting the likes of Rosa Parks, 
Claudette Colvin, Reverend Martin Lu-
ther King, and even our own John 
Lewis and those protesters who dared 
to march across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. His trailblazing work dared 
this Nation to live up to its highest 
ideals, leading to the desegregation of 
the University of Alabama, Auburn 
University, 
and 
Alabama’s 
public 
schools. 
Attorney Gray’s long and accom-
plished career fought back against in-
justice wherever it existed. To para-
phrase one of his clients, the Reverend 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Attorney Gray 
was a drum major for justice, peace, 
and righteousness. 
As we celebrate another year of At-
torney Gray’s life, it is my hope that 
President Biden will strongly consider 
awarding him our Nation’s highest ci-
vilian honor, the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom. There is no one more deserv-
ing. Let’s give him his flowers as he 
lives. 
f 
PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, we pay tribute to the lives lost 
on December 7, 1941. 
Eighty years ago, Japan launched a 
surprise sneak attack on the U.S. naval 
base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The at-
tack on Pearl Harbor took well over 
2,000 military and civilian lives. 
This unprovoked act of war served as 
a rallying cry for all Americans to 
stand up for their brothers and sisters 
in the name of freedom, liberty, and se-
curity. 
In my home district, a local treasure, 
Lou Conter, one of the last two living 
survivors of the USS Arizona, resides 
in Grass Valley. We could not be more 
proud of Mr. Conter and what he fought 
for. It is my honor to be his Represent-
ative. 
This last September, Lou turned 100 
years old. He is still full of vigor, 
verve, and a smile for everybody. He is 
truly a pleasure to be around. 
Lou’s efforts and our eventual tri-
umph as a country over the evil at 
Pearl Harbor and all through World 
War II is proof of the unbounded deter-
mination of people like Lou and of the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize today the 
lives lost at Pearl Harbor and salute all 
who served to ensure the safety then 
and now of all of our families in this 
great country. 
f 
HONORING BASEBALL HALL OF 
FAMER MINNIE MINOSO 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in 1954, I 
was stricken with polio. In 1955, not 
quite 6 years of age, I went to a base-
ball game in a segregated Memphis, 
Tennessee. I had crutches, a White Sox 
cap, and a White Sox T-shirt. A player 
gave me a baseball, a White player. 
I went to my dad and told him about 
it, and we went down to thank him. He 
said: Don’t thank me. Thank that play-
er over there, No. 9. 
He was the blackest player in the 
stadium in the first integrated game in 
Memphis, Minnie Minoso. 
Minoso didn’t feel comfortable giving 
a baseball to a White boy in Memphis 
in 1955 at the exhibition game. That 
lucky moment for me gave me a hero 
and an angel who stayed with me all 
my life. 
Later in 1960, when he came to Mem-
phis, we visited not at the Peabody 
where the White players were but at 
the Lorraine Hotel where the Black 
players stayed. He was a nine-time all- 
star baseball player in the segregated 
Lorraine Hotel. 
We maintained our friendship over 
the years. 
This is a picture of me giving him a 
certificate in Comiskey Park, where he 
played seven decades, the most decades 
of anybody playing professional ball. 
In this picture, we were in Memphis 
at the Civil Rights Baseball Game. 
One of the first things I did when I 
was a Congressman was to introduce a 
resolution to honor the Negro League

Baseball Hall of Fame in Kansas City. 
In it, I said that Minnie Minoso would 
have been in the Hall of Fame but for 
segregation and spending years in the 
Pacific Coast League and the Negro 
Leagues when he should have been in 
the major leagues. It was killed in the 
Senate by Jim Bunning, a Senator who 
was also a Hall of Famer. 
On Sunday, Minnie Minoso was voted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
I took Minnie to Cuba when I went 
there and handed out No. 9 pins, and I 
handed out baseball cards to Cuban 
fans when I was there for the baseball 
game that President Obama put to-
gether. The Cuban people loved him. He 
was their Jackie Robinson. 
On January 24, he goes in the Hall of 
Fame with Jim Bunning. I thank the 
Baseball Hall of Fame, and I thank 
Minnie Minoso. He has been my hero.

REMEMBERING SENATOR BOB 
DOLE 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, America 
has lost a statesman, noble war hero, 
and service-minded Kansan who never 
forgot where he came from. Senator 
Bob Dole died peacefully at the age of 
98, having left his district, State, and 
this country better for the many con-
tributions he made over 79 years of 
public life. 
I was blessed to spend some time 
with Senator Dole a few weeks ago. His 
love for Kansas and its people were on 
full display in his excited curiosity 
about our plans for the Big First Dis-
trict. 
He was a thoughtful, committed, and 
energetic champion for our Nation and 
our way of life in rural Kansas. He al-
ways treated others with respect and 
kindness, especially his fellow vet-
erans, as he attended nearly every 
Honor Flight that came to Washington, 
D.C. He was a fierce advocate for his 
political views, but he was equally 
committed to cross-aisle friendship and 
comradery. 
I left our time together inspired and 
commissioned, as Senator Dole made it 
clear we must never forget where we 
come from. He knew deep down that 
the heartbeat of our Nation lies in 
places like his hometown of Russell, 
Kansas. His legacy will echo into the 
future, and his patriotic spirit serves 
as a benchmark for anyone who be-
lieves that our brightest days are yet 
to come. 
I thank Senator Dole for working 
tirelessly to make our world a better 
place. May he rest in peace. 
Mr. Speaker, my prayers and grati-
tude for Senator Bob Dole go out to his 
family.

HARRISONBURG 
BOYS 
& 
GIRLS 
CLUBS CELEBRATES 25TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Boys & Girls Clubs of 
Harrisonburg in Rockingham County, 
which will celebrate its 25th anniver-
sary on December 21. 
Since its founding in 1955, this orga-
nization has grown from just one loca-
tion to now more than seven through-
out the region. For the past two-and-a- 
half decades, they have worked to en-
sure children in Shenandoah Valley 
have a safe, inclusive, and supportive 
environment to call home after school. 
They are committed to fulfilling 
their mission to help mold our region’s 
youth into productive, caring, respon-
sible citizens through programs focused 
on academic success, healthy life-
styles, good character, and citizenship. 
Serving more than 900 kids annually, 
ages 5 to 18, for the past quarter-cen-
tury, the positive contribution the 
group has had on the valley’s youth is 
immeasurable. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the orga-
nization on its first 25 years of success 
and wish them many more. Our com-
munity is forever grateful for all they 
do.

b 1015 
NY–22 STATE FOOTBALL 
CHAMPIONS 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize three New York State 
Section Four high school teams. This 
past weekend, for the first time since 
2019, hundreds of players, coaches, par-
ents, and fans from across the great 
State of New York returned to Syra-
cuse University’s Carrier Dome to com-
pete for a New York State Public High 
School Athletic Association Football 
Championship. 
This past Friday, the Class D, 12-win, 
undefeated Tioga Tigers, led by Head 
Coach Nick Aiello, roared to victory 
with a 27–0 victory over the Moriah Vi-
kings, winning their second State 
championship in school history. 
Saturday’s games would bring more 
fun to New York State’s 22nd District. 
First, the fourth-seeded Class C, 12- 
and-1 Blue Devils of Chenango Forks, 
led by Head Coach David Hogan, played 
a rematch of their 2019 championship 
game, and again beat the Schuylerville 
Horses, this time with a convincing 21– 
0 shutout victory. 
And last, but certainly not least, the 
13-and-1, Class B, Maine-Endwell Spar-
tans, led by Head Coach Matt Galla-
gher, came back from a 12–7 halftime 
deficit, to outscore the Pleasantville 
Panthers 14–0 in the second half, win-
ning their first State championship 
since 2014. 
One State, 27 congressional rep-
resentatives, five championship divi-
sions, and New York State’s 22nd dis-
trict took home the trophies in three 
of four divisions we competed in. 
Congratulations to all teams from 
the 22nd District.

CONGRATULATING MIKE 
FLETCHER ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. ELLZEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I come to 
the House floor today to congratulate 
Mike Fletcher, the store director of the 
H-E-B in Corsicana, Texas. After 27 
years, Mike did something we all hope 
to do one day, and that is retire. 
Though not a Corsicana native, Mike 
has come to call Corsicana home. He 
grew up in Waco, and lived there until 
he was about 20, and then attended 
Texas A&M University and while at-
tending school, started his career in 
the grocery industry. 
What H-E-B and Mike have done for 
Corsicana and the surrounding commu-
nity over the last 19 years cannot be 
captured in a 1-minute speech. But 
what I can say is that Mike has served 
his community. He kept the doors 
open, the shelves stocked, and the com-
munity fed during the COVID–19 pan-
demic and the winter storm that hit 
the great State of Texas. 
He and his wife, Deedy, have been an 
integral part of Navarro County since 
they moved there in 2002. Mike has 
served on the Salvation Army board, 
the United Way board of Navarro Coun-
ty, been a member of the Rotary Club, 
volunteered on disaster relief teams in 
West, Texas, when the fertilizer plants 
exploded in 2013, and much more. 
He might be retired from working at 
H-E-B, but he is not finished serving 
his community. 
So, Mike, congratulations on your re-
tirement and thank you for your con-
tinued dedication to Corsicana and 
Navarro County.

RECOGNIZING ENES KANTER 
FREEDOM 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Enes Kanter 
Freedom. 
Since being drafted third overall in 
the 2011 NBA draft, Mr. Freedom, a 
newly minted American citizen, has 
made our country incredibly proud. 
Growing up in Turkey, Enes says he 
did not know what freedom was until 
he moved to the United States. And 
since then, he has used his platform to 
speak out against human rights atroc-
ities in China, Turkey, and beyond. 
Enes uses his voice for the people 
around the world who are voiceless. 
And because of his outspoken criti-
cism of Turkey’s authoritarian regime 
and inhumane treatment of political 
prisoners, the Turkish Government re-
voked Enes’ passport and issued mul-
tiple warrants for his arrest, leaving

him stateless for many years. And in 
China, broadcasts of Enes’ basketball 
games were banned after he criticized 
the Chinese Communist Party’s repres-
sive regime and their human rights 
abuses against the Uighurs and Tibet-
ans. 
Since facing backlash, Enes has made 
it his life’s mission to push the bound-
aries of what is possible on and off the 
court. He understands and recognizes 
using his voice and the importance of 
it. 
After waiting six long years, Mr. 
Speaker, last week Enes finally became 
a U.S. citizen, and at his citizenship 
ceremony, he recited the oath using his 
newly minted last name, Freedom. And 
I cannot think of a more appropriate 
new last name for Enes, as he embodies 
all that freedom means. And by chang-
ing his last name, Enes can now carry 
that word with him wherever he goes. 
Mr. Speaker, I salute the brave work 
of Enes Kanter Freedom. At a time 
when others remain silent, he has spo-
ken up. 
I congratulate Enes on his citizen-
ship, and this United States Congress 
and all of us welcome him to our Amer-
ican family.

SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
5545, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5545, as amended, the Respon-
sible Education Mitigating Options and 
Technical Extensions Act, or the RE-
MOTE Act. This bill is an urgent ex-
tension of flexibilities for student vet-
erans using their educational assist-
ance benefits as the COVID–19 pan-
demic wears on. 
H.R. 5545, as amended, extends the 
Student Veteran Coronavirus Response 
Act of 2020 through the spring 2022 
term. 
When 
my 
Student 
Veteran 
Coronavirus Response Act was signed 
into law in April 2020, I am not sure 
many of us would have foreseen that 19 
months later the COVID–19 pandemic 
would still affect everyday life for vet-
erans and their families across the 
country. 
And since then, we have extended 
these flexibilities for student veterans 
three times as the pandemic remains a 
public health emergency throughout 
the country and the world. Still, many 
college students remain unable to re-
turn to campus. 
H.R. 5545, as amended, would extend 
remote learning waivers for student 
veterans through the spring 2022 term 
and ensure they will continue receiving 
full housing benefits despite not taking 
on-campus courses. 
We have been negotiating this bill 
with the minority for months and, 
while this bill is not the exact version 
that I would prefer, student veterans 
are simply too important to let these 
benefits lapse. 
A majority of students have already 
enrolled in their spring classes, having 
signed up as early as this past October 
or November. They selected their class-
es with the hope that we, in Congress, 
would act to extend these flexibilities 
through the spring term. We cannot 
wait any longer to pass this critical 
piece of legislation for our student vet-
erans. 
New cases of the virus are up. There 
is a new variant, leading some States 
to declare a new state of emergency, 
and it is clear, COVID–19 is not behind 
us. The emergency persists, and we 
cannot walk away from our duty to as-
sist student veterans now. 
Without this legislation, student vet-
erans who planned and started out the 
school 
year 
remotely—reasonably 
thinking they would be able to stay in 
status for the entire school year—will 
have to figure out a plan to get back to 
taking on-campus classes in order to 
receive their monthly allowance for 
housing. 
This legislation is to address this 
specific emergency now. This is not 
setting precedent for any future emer-
gencies, nor is it setting a standard for 
treating future education terms im-
pacted by COVID–19. 
Should we have to extend these pro-
visions again next year, we should use 
the same emergency designations we 
have used three times in the past. We 
know these provisions are not for new 
benefits. They are to maintain existing 
benefits and existing spending. 
Additionally, this bill ensures stu-
dent bodies at U.S. universities remain 
diverse and allows for the continued re-
cruitment of foreign students. It also 
simplifies the verification process for 
tuition reimbursement for certain edu-
cational 
institutions 
to 
minimize 
unneeded paperwork for student vet-
erans. 
Student veterans should be able to 
focus on their studies, not on whether 
they are going to receive their earned 
VA benefits. And that is why I intro-
duced this bill, with my House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee colleagues, 
Representative TRONE and Representa-
tive MIKE LEVIN, to ease the burden on 
student veterans during these persist-
ently uncertain times. 
Now, this legislation is endorsed by 
numerous VSOs, such as the Student 
Veterans of America, the American Le-
gion, the VFW, American Council on 
Education, Tragedy Assistance for Sur-
vivors, Association of Public and Land- 
grant Universities, and the National 
Association of Veterans’ Program Ad-
ministrators, and countless others. 
Finally, the legislation includes an 
additional provision from Representa-
tives LAMB and MANN. The text of this 
section of the bill would help the De-
partment address diversity and equity 
within the workforce. It removes a 1997 
law that limits the number of VA coun-
selors who can advise employees on 
equal employment opportunity issues. 
VA has roughly doubled in size since 
1997, and VA requested for this limit to 
be removed to allow the Department to 
hire additional counselors to support 
the needs of a growing workforce and 
help ensure that VA is a welcoming 
place for all employees. 
I wish to thank Speaker PELOSI and 
Majority Leader HOYER
for bringing 
this legislation to the floor; and I urge 
the rest of my colleagues to support 
this legislation to ensure student vet-
erans are able to access the benefits 
they have earned and continue their 
studies during the spring semester. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5545, as amended, the REMOTE Act. I 
am pleased to support this bill, which 
is very similar to my bill, H.R. 5509, 
the Student Veteran COVID–19 Protec-
tion Act of 2021. This bill will help ad-
dress urgent needs of student veterans 
who are impacted by COVID–19. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, 
Congress worked to ensure that stu-
dent veterans’ GI bill housing allow-
ance payments were not cut when in- 
person classes were moved online.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7470 
December 8, 2021 
The current authorization for this 
protection expires on December 21, 
2021. H.R. 5545, as amended, would ex-
tend it through June 1 of 2021. This 
would provide veterans and schools 
with the certainty that students will 
not see a reduction in their monthly 
housing checks this school year. 
The bill also includes changes to en-
sure that GI bill students can attend 
foreign schools and give American 
schools time to comply with new con-
sumer protection rules. 
It includes a change to the VA’s 
rounding-out policy to allow students 
to retain their full monthly housing al-
lowance, even if they finish their pro-
gram-required coursework early. 
Finally, it also includes language 
sponsored by Congressman LAMB and 
Congressman MANN to remove the cap 
on the equal employment opportunity 
counselors at the VA. There is no place 
for discrimination at the VA. I am 
pleased that we can, once again, pass 
this important provision to help em-
ployees avail themselves of their right 
for a safe workplace. 
The costs of this bill are fully paid 
for by extending current VA home loan 
funding fees for a few months into 2030. 
This is a bipartisan offset that has 
been used multiple times in previous 
Congresses. 
This issue of whether to offset the es-
timated $220 million mandatory costs 
associated with this bill has been an 
issue of disagreement for many weeks, 
and I want to thank Chairman TAKANO 
for working with me and finding a mu-
tually beneficial solution that is paid 
for and can quickly pass the Senate. 
This is win for the veterans, schools, 
and taxpayers alike. 
b 1030 
In 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
cir-
cumstances, I strongly believe that 
Congress should do our job and pay for 
this new spending. We have a responsi-
bility to pay for our bills, just like 
every American does. However, that 
does not mean that I will not consider 
the use of emergency spending when it 
is appropriate and necessary in the fu-
ture as new emergencies may arise. 
Before I close, I would like to thank 
the dozens of higher education groups 
and veterans service organizations that 
have advocated for the passage of this 
needed extension and reform. 
I want to especially thank the Amer-
ican Council on Education and the Stu-
dent Veterans of America for their con-
tinued support for this fully paid for 
legislation. They understand that if 
these changes are not made soon, many 
schools will be forced to stop accepting 
students who are using the GI Bill. I 
agree with them that such an outcome 
is simply unacceptable. 
While I wish we could have enacted 
these protections weeks ago, I am glad 
we are taking care of them today on a 
bipartisan basis that protects veterans 
and taxpayers alike. 
I, again, want to thank Chairman 
TAKANO for working with me and oth-
ers on this issue, as well as our col-
leagues, Senators TESTER and MORAN, 
for their support. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE), my good friend and 
the author of H.R. 5545, as amended. He 
is a member of the House Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee and an active member 
on the Subcommittee on Economic Op-
portunity and the Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of our bill, the RE-
MOTE Learning Act, to protect vet-
erans’ education benefits. 
Last year, Congress prevented cuts to 
veterans’ tuition payments as students 
transitioned to online learning. This 
helped folks stay in school during the 
pandemic, which remains one of the 
most challenging times to pursue high-
er education. 
Unfortunately, these benefits are at 
risk once again. By law, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs is required to 
cut housing benefits for student vet-
erans who are taking classes remotely. 
This doesn’t make sense during a glob-
al pandemic. 
While some colleges and professors 
have chosen to keep classes remote, 
many student veterans have opted to 
live on campus. We need to act now to 
ensure our veterans receive the nec-
essary flexibility to achieve academic 
success. 
The REMOTE Learning Act will ex-
tend remote learning waivers, ensure 
veterans receive full housing benefits, 
allow universities to continue recruit-
ing foreign students so that student 
bodies can remain diverse, and mini-
mize paperwork for tuition reimburse-
ment. 
Our veterans deserve a world-class 
education. They deserve to earn their 
degrees on time. Some of these brave 
servicemembers 
have 
waited 
their 
whole lives to get their degrees. The 
negative 
effects 
of 
the 
pandemic 
shouldn’t hinder them from doing that. 
We have a responsibility to help. 
I want to thank Chairman TAKANO 
and Chairman LEVIN for their leader-
ship on this bill and for all the hard 
work they have done to protect our 
veterans. It is time to pass this bill and 
give the veterans the benefits they 
have earned. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I 
just want to let everyone know that I 
am very much in support of this legis-
lation. I encourage my colleagues to 
support it as well, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work 
and cooperation of the ranking mem-
ber, and I appreciate that he stands 
squarely behind this legislation. 
What is at stake at the very end of 
this year is the housing of our Nation’s 
student veterans, numbering in the 
tens of thousands. We need swift pas-
sage of this bill and the companion bill 
in the Senate. 
I urge all Members of the House to 
support this bill, and I urge our Senate 
colleagues to act on this expeditiously. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 5545, 
as amended, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5545, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to extend certain ex-
piring provisions of law relating to 
benefits provided under Department of 
Veterans Affairs educational assistance 
programs during COVID–19 pandemic, 
and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
NASA ENHANCED USE LEASING 
EXTENSION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5746) to amend title 51, United 
States Code, to extend the authority of 
the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration to enter into leases of 
non-excess property of the Administra-
tion, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5746 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘NASA En-
hanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress find the following: 
(1) NASA uses enhanced use leasing to 
enter into agreements with private sector 
entities, State and local governments, aca-
demic institutions, and other Federal agen-
cies for lease of non-excess, underutilized 
NASA properties and facilities. 
(2) NASA uses enhanced use leasing au-
thority to support responsible management 
of its real property, including to improve the 
use of underutilized property for activities 
that are compatible with NASA’s mission 
and to reduce facility operating and mainte-
nance costs. 
(3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced 
use lease authority, NASA leased 65 real 
properties. 
(4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA’s use of en-
hanced use leasing resulted in the collection 
of $10,843,025.77 in net revenue. 
(5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion 
of its enhanced use leasing revenues for re-
pairs of facility control systems such as 
lighting and heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning. 
(6) NASA’s use of enhanced use leasing au-
thority can contribute to reducing the rate 
of increase of the Agency’s overall deferred 
maintenance cost.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5746, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
passage of the bipartisan NASA En-
hanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 
2021, H.R. 5746. 
I want to thank my colleagues, 
Ranking Member BRIAN BABIN of the 
Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics, Representative TROY CARTER, 
and Representative YOUNG
KIM, for 
being original cosponsors. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense 
bill that would enable public- and pri-
vate-sector entities the opportunity to 
benefit from NASA property that is not 
fully used, while helping NASA manage 
its vast facilities and maintenance 
challenges. 
The act would extend NASA’S au-
thority to enter into leases for under-
utilized, non-excess real property, in-
cluding office space, testing and launch 
facilities, and hangars, to other Fed-
eral, State, and local government agen-
cies, academic institutions, and pri-
vate-sector entities. 
NASA’s existing enhanced use lease 
authority, or EUL, expires on the last 
day of this month, December 31, 2021. 
While several short-term extensions 
have previously been enacted, this act 
provides a clean, 10-year extension that 
will create more certainty for NASA 
and the many EUL partners who ben-
efit from the authority. According to 
the July 2021 NASA testimony to the 
Subcommittee on Space and Aero-
nautics, that I chair and Dr. BABIN is 
the ranking member of, the agency has 
70 ongoing leases at six NASA centers. 
The authority also allows NASA to 
retain lease revenue and apply it to-
ward maintenance, capital revitaliza-
tion, and improvement of NASA’s real 
property assets. 
That is important because with the 
majority of NASA’s facilities dating 
back to the Apollo era and over 80 per-
cent beyond their design life, mainte-
nance is an ongoing challenge. NASA 
currently manages a deferred mainte-
nance backlog of $2.6 billion. The rev-
enue NASA receives from enhanced use 
leases, $10.8 million in fiscal year 2019, 
can help avoid further increases to that 
backlog. 
EUL authority also benefits the pri-
vate entities, the Federal, State, and 
local government agencies, and the 
academic institutions that enter into 
lease agreements to use specialized fa-
cilities and properties, such as launch 
infrastructure, while also providing the 
valuable service to NASA of maintain-
ing the properties. 
In addition, co-locating other Fed-
eral, State, and local government agen-
cies, private-sector entities, and other 
institutions on NASA properties cre-
ates a vibrancy and community at 
NASA centers that benefits NASA and 
its workforce, including through part-
nerships with those institutions. 
Mr. Speaker, NASA’s leadership and 
success in expanding our knowledge 
through groundbreaking scientific dis-
coveries and extending human presence 
deeper into space inspires our youth, 
advances our technological capacity, 
and strengthens our economy. 
Enabling such an inspiring mission 
requires unique infrastructure and ex-
tensive property and facilities. We need 
to ensure that NASA has the tools and 
flexibilities to continue its successes 
for decades to come. Those tools in-
clude the ability to manage property 
that may no longer be actively or fully 
used by NASA, at least at this time. 
The bipartisan NASA Enhanced Use 
Leasing Extension Act of 2021 ensures 
the benefits of EUL authority will con-
tinue for the next decade, and in so 
doing, provides stability to NASA and 
its EUL partners. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is 
good for NASA, good for the entities 
that benefit from EUL authority, and 
good for the taxpayer. 
We cannot afford to let this impor-
tant authority lapse and risk delays 
and disruption to the many new leases 
currently being processed by NASA. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
and support passage of H.R. 5746 so that 
the Senate can swiftly pass it and send 
it to the President’s desk for signature 
and enactment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support strong 
of H.R. 5746, the NASA Enhanced Use 
Leasing Extension Act of 2021, legisla-
tion that I cosponsored, to extend 
NASA’s enhanced use leasing author-
ity, which expires on December 31. 
NASA has used enhanced use leases 
for almost 20 years to enter into ar-
rangements to lease idle or underuti-
lized areas on NASA property to the 
private sector, to State and local gov-
ernments, and to academic institutions 
and universities. 
NASA can then use some of the 
money raised from the leases to offset 
spending for facilities maintenance, 
capital revitalization, and real prop-
erty improvements. NASA expects to 
collect over $14 million in net revenue 
in 2022 from enhanced use leases and 
apply that money to its deferred main-
tenance backlog. 
The last extension of the enhanced 
use lease authority was for 2 years. 
H.R. 5746 will extend it for 10 years, 
until December 31, 2031. 
This 
10-year 
authority 
will 
give 
NASA and its partners the flexibility 
and predictability to enter into longer 
term leases, which could reduce the 
burden on taxpayers and help the 
United States’ commercial space indus-
try continue to compete and out-inno-
vate the world. 
I proudly represent the Johnson 
Space Center of Houston, Texas. As a 
strong advocate for this vital NASA 
center, as well as for all of our NASA 
centers, I want to make sure that we 
are doing the utmost to empower the 
brilliant men and women supporting 
our 
space 
industry, 
scientific 
dis-
covery, and human exploration. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield as 
much time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. CAR-
TER). 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, NASA’s Michoud Assembly 
Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, is 
known as America’s rocket factory. 
For over 55 years, Michoud has man-
ufactured large vehicles and compo-
nents for NASA, from the Apollo pro-
gram to the space shuttle to the Space 
Launch System, or the SLS. 
Michoud is the main manufacturing 
and assembly site for SLS, which will 
take us to the furthest reaches of our 
solar system. 
This 
site 
employs 
approximately 
3,500 people but supports more than 
6,000 jobs nationwide. This includes 
government civil service workers, con-
tractors, and staff of other government 
agencies, as well as commercial firms, 
including firms from Louisiana that 
create a significant number of jobs and 
economic opportunities. 
The National Center for Advanced 
Manufacturing, a partnership between 
NASA, the State of Louisiana, Lou-
isiana 
State 
University 
in 
Baton 
Rouge, and the University of New Orle-
ans, also calls Michoud home. The 
total economic output of Michoud is 
over $830 million. 
All this to say, Michoud is an indis-
pensable part of the New Orleans’ econ-
omy, New Orleans’ community, and our 
Nation’s space program. 
Sites like Michoud would benefit 
greatly from the passage of H.R. 5746, 
which reauthorizes the enhanced use 
leases needed to keep up production.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7472 
December 8, 2021 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this bill and ask that all Mem-
bers support this bill. I urge a ‘‘yea’’ 
vote for this incredibly important 
piece of legislation to maintain and to 
continue the work that we have done 
at Michoud with NASA for our coun-
try. 
b 1045 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
5746, the NASA Enhanced Use Leasing 
Extension Act. This is a bipartisan bill 
I was proud to colead with Space and 
Aeronautics 
Subcommittee 
Chair 
BEYER, Ranking Member BABIN, and 
Representative TROY CARTER. 
H.R. 5746 would allow NASA to con-
tinue leasing any underutilized, non- 
excess property owned by the Federal 
Government to private-sector entities, 
State and local governments, academic 
institutions, and other agencies in-
volved in the research, development, 
and deployment of space innovation. 
We need an all-hands-on-deck ap-
proach to help the U.S. lead the global 
space race for innovation and the de-
velopment of new technologies, and 
this legislation aims to do exactly 
that. I am proud to support H.R. 5746, 
those on the front lines of space inno-
vation, and aerospace manufacturers in 
southern California that create the 
tools for the United States to continue 
reaching new heights. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
5746. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time to speak on 
this bill, and I am prepared to close 
when necessary. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, passage of this legisla-
tion will allow NASA to better manage 
their infrastructure, maintain their fa-
cilities, and support the commercial 
space industry. The provision is fis-
cally responsible, as it helps NASA col-
lect revenue from its underutilized 
properties. 
Congress will continue to provide 
oversight of how NASA uses this au-
thority in the coming years to ensure 
that taxpayer interests are protected 
and that the authority is not misused. 
I would like to thank Representative 
FRANK LUCAS, the ranking member of 
the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee, for his leadership on this 
important topic. He is a strong advo-
cate for not only our Nation’s space 
program but for our entire scientific 
enterprise, both public and private. 
I would also like to thank Chair-
woman EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON, my 
colleague from Texas, and also my 
friend, Chairman DON BEYER, for their 
efforts to expedite this bill, as well as 
the majority and minority staff of the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee. 
I would also like to thank the NASA 
civil servant and contractor workforce. 
Despite 
the 
challenges 
posed 
by 
COVID–19, NASA employees and con-
tractors have been able to accomplish 
phenomenal achievements. From once 
again launching American astronauts 
on American rockets from American 
soil, to landing a rover the size of an 
SUV on Mars, to flying the first heli-
copter on another planet, NASA has 
not missed a stride. These achieve-
ments are a credit to the perseverance 
and fortitude of the entire NASA fam-
ily, and I look forward to witnessing 
many more amazing feats in the com-
ing weeks and months. It is an exciting 
time. 
Finally, I would also like to recog-
nize the passing yesterday of Mark 
Geyer, the former Director of Johnson 
Space Center. Mark was a stalwart 
leader, 
a 
skilled 
engineer, 
and 
a 
thoughtful friend. 
Representing the Johnson Space Cen-
ter afforded me the opportunity to 
work with Mark over the years, and I 
can tell you that he had a profound im-
pact on our Nation’s space program. 
I would also like to wish his wife, 
Jackie, his three children, and the en-
tire Geyer family my heartfelt condo-
lences and thank them for Mark’s serv-
ice to NASA, the American people, and 
the noble endeavor of space explo-
ration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I concur 
with my friend Dr. BABIN that we are 
very fortunate to be led by EDDIE BER-
NICE JOHNSON, our chair, and FRANK 
LUCAS, our ranking member. It is a joy 
to work on this committee, and we ac-
tually work together in a good way. I 
would like to thank the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. CARTER), and the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM) for cosponsoring this and helping 
put this together, and our wonderful 
Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee 
staff, who actually took the time to 
put the title of this bill in iambic pen-
tameter, the NASA Enhanced Use 
Leasing Extension Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to vote for this good bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5746, the ‘‘NASA Enhanced 
Use Lease Extension Act of 2021’’. 
I want to thank Chairman BEYER of the Sub-
committee on Space and Aeronautics for intro-
ducing this bipartisan bill, along with Sub-
committee Rankin Member BABIN, Represent-
ative 
TROY
CARTER, 
and 
Representative 
YOUNG KIM , as original cosponsors. 
As Chair of the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology, I’ve had the privilege 
over the years to visit many NASA Field Cen-
ters and witness the extensive infrastructure 
required to support our nation’s inspiring 
space program. 
Some of those properties are underutilized 
and many are aging. Therefore, they can fall 
into disrepair. 
NASA facilities, properties, and infrastruc-
ture comprise over 5,000 buildings and struc-
tures, including those at its field centers, and 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
The extension of enhanced use leasing au-
thority in this bill helps NASA manage the 
agency’s real property, including the preserva-
tion of underutilized or unique, historic prop-
erties. 
As Chairman BEYER noted, enhanced use 
leasing, or ‘‘EUL’’, allows NASA to enter into 
agreements with state and local governments, 
academia, private sector entities, and other 
Federal government agencies to lease non-ex-
cess and underutilized properties at NASA. 
EUL authority allows the agency to accept 
lease revenues, in turn helping NASA to re-
duce operating costs and make repairs and 
improvements to facility systems. 
According to NASA, in Fiscal Year 2019, 
five NASA Centers used enhanced use leas-
ing resulting in a total of over $10 million in 
net revenue for the agency. 
Congress first granted NASA authority to 
demonstrate enhanced use leasing at two 
NASA Field Centers as part the Fiscal Year 
2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution. 
The Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropria-
tions Act expanded the authority to agency- 
wide use. 
Since then, the authority has been amended 
in 2008, and further amended in 2012 to allow 
NASA to accept in-kind considerations for 
leases for the purpose of developing renew-
able energy production facilities. 
The most recent extension of EUL authority 
was in the Fiscal Year 2020 Further Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, where the authority 
was extended for 2 years, until December 31, 
2021, the end of this year. The bill we are 
considering today provides a clean ten-year 
extension until December 31, 2031. 
This longer term extension provides consist-
ency and certainty to NASA and tenants, al-
lowing NASA to continue existing EUL ar-
rangements and make progress on developing 
new arrangements that are currently under-
way. 
Enhanced use leasing is an important, well- 
used authority that benefits NASA and the 
many institutions that enter into EUL leases. 
We must act now to extend it. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote yes and pass H.R. 5746, the 
bipartisan ‘‘NASA Enhanced Use Lease Ex-
tension Act of 2021.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5746, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Code, is amended by adding by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(d) PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION.—A com-
mon carrier, marine terminal operator, or 
ocean transportation intermediary, either 
alone or in conjunction with any other per-
son, directly or indirectly, may not retaliate 
against a shipper, a shipper’s agent, or a 
motor carrier by refusing, or threatening to 
refuse, cargo space accommodations when 
available, or resort to other unfair or un-
justly discriminatory methods because the 
shipper has patronized another carrier, has 
filed a complaint, or for any other reason. 
‘‘(e) CERTIFICATION.—A common carrier or 
marine terminal operator shall not charge 
any other person demurrage or detention 
charges under a tariff, marine terminal

an accurate certification that such charges 
comply with all rules and regulations con-
cerning demurrage or detention issued by 
the Commission. The certification require-
ment only applies to the entity that estab-
lishes the charge, and a common carrier or 
marine terminal operator that collects a 
charge on behalf of another common carrier 
or marine terminal operator is not respon-
sible for providing the certification, except 
that an invoice from a common carrier or 
marine terminal operator collecting a charge 
on behalf of another must include a certifi-
cation from the party that established the 
charge.’’. 
SEC. 9. PROHIBITION ON UNREASONABLY DE-
CLINING CARGO.

to fail to furnish containers or other facili-
ties and instrumentalities needed to perform 
transportation services, including allocation 
of vessel space accommodations, in consider-
ation of reasonably foreseeable import and 
export demands; or 
‘‘(15) unreasonably decline export cargo 
bookings if such cargo can be loaded safely

cline’’ for the purposes of subsection (a)(15) 
of section 41104 of title 46, United States 
Code (as added by subsection (a)). 
(2) CONTENTS.—The rulemaking under para-
graph (1) shall address the unreasonableness 
of ocean common carriers prioritizing the 
shipment of empty containers while exclud-
ing, limiting, or otherwise reducing the ship-
ment of full, loaded containers when such 
containers 
are 
readily 
available 
to 
be 
shipped and the appurtenant vessel has the 
weight and space capacity available to carry 
such containers if loaded in a safe and timely 
manner.

carrier to include a certification under sec-
tion 41102(e) alongside any demurrage or de-
tention charge shall eliminate any obliga-
tion of the charged party to pay the applica-
ble charge. 
‘‘(e) DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION PRACTICES 
AND CHARGES.—Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law and not later than 30 days of 
the date of enactment of this subsection, a 
common carrier or marine terminal oper-
ator, shall— 
‘‘(1) act in a manner consistent with any 
rules or regulations concerning demurrage or 
detention issued by the Commission; 
‘‘(2) maintain all records supporting the as-
sessment of any demurrage or detention 
charges for a period of 5 years and provide 
such records to the invoiced party or to the 
Commission on request; and 
‘‘(3) bear the burden of establishing the 
reasonableness of any demurrage or deten-
tion charges which are the subject of any 
complaint proceeding challenging a common 
carrier or marine terminal operator demur-
rage or detention charges as unjust and un-
reasonable. 
‘‘(f) PENALTIES FOR FALSE OR INACCURATE 
CERTIFIED
DEMURRAGE
OR
DETENTION 
CHARGES.—In the event of a finding that the 
certification under section 41102(e) was inac-
curate, or false after submission under sec-
tion 41301, penalties under section 41107 shall 
be applied if the Commission determines, in 
a separate enforcement proceeding, such cer-
tification was inaccurate or false.’’. 
(b) RULEMAKING ON DETENTION AND DEMUR-
RAGE.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Federal Maritime Commission shall initiate

prohibiting common carriers and marine ter-
minal operators from adopting and applying 
unjust and unreasonable demurrage and de-
tention rules and practices. 
(2) CONTENTS.—The rulemaking under para-
graph (1) shall address the issues identified 
in the final rule published on May 18, 2020, ti-
tled ‘‘Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and 
Detention Under the Shipping Act’’ (85 Fed. 
Reg. 29638), including the following: 
(A) Establishing clear and uniform defini-
tions for demurrage, detention, cargo avail-
ability for retrieval and associated free time, 
and other terminology used in the rule. The 
definition for cargo availability for retrieval 
shall account for government inspections. 
(B) Establishing that demurrage and deten-
tion rules are not independent revenue 
sources but incentivize efficiencies in the 
ocean transportation network, including the 
retrieval of cargo and return of equipment. 
(C) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of demurrage and deten-
tion charges when obstacles to the cargo re-
trieval or return of equipment are within the 
scope of responsibility of the carrier or their 
agent and beyond the control of the invoiced 
or contracting party. 
(D) Prohibiting the commencement or con-
tinuation of free time unless cargo is avail-
able for retrieval and timely notice of cargo 
availability has been provided. 
(E) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of demurrage charges 
when marine terminal appointments are not 
available during the free time period. 
(F) Prohibiting the consumption of free 
time or collection of detention charges on 
containers when the marine terminal re-
quired for return is not open or available.

charges that will allow the invoiced party to 
validate the charges. 
(I) Requiring common carriers and marine 
terminal operators to establish reasonable 
dispute resolution policies and practices. 
(J) Establishing the responsibilities of 
shippers, receivers, and draymen with re-
spect to cargo retrieval and equipment re-
turn. 
(K) Clarifying rules for the invoicing of 
parties other than the shipper for any de-
murrage, detention, or other similar per con-
tainer 
charges, 
including 
determining 
whether such parties should be billed at all. 
(c) 
RULEMAKING
ON
MINIMUM
SERVICE 
STANDARDS.—Not later than 90 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Commis-
sion shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7476 
December 8, 2021 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4996, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
chairman of the committee, Mr. DEFA-
ZIO. Congressman DUSTY JOHNSON and I 
announced our intention to pursue this 
bipartisan legislation, the Ocean Ship-
ping Reform Act of 2021, just this past 
June. In late August, we introduced 
H.R. 4996 and have since earned the 
support of more than 90 bipartisan co-
sponsors. On November 17, the Biden 
administration put out a public state-
ment endorsing our bipartisan bill. 
Now, less than 4 months since we 
first began to develop this legislation, I 
am thrilled—in fact, I am awed, and I 
am amazed but very happy—that the 
House is taking up our comprehensive 
reform. 
The amendment in the nature of a 
substitute reflects relatively minor 
changes and a reorganization of H.R. 
4996 as introduced. In other words, it is 
not important to the substance of the 
bill. I am thrilled with the compromise 
legislative text reached by the commit-
tee’s majority and minority staff and 
the members. 
This is what the voters sent us here 
to do, to identify problems, develop 
practical solutions, and then work to-
gether across the aisle to reach a com-
promise to achieve a result. That is ex-
actly what the House, both Democrats 
and Republicans, are now doing in tak-
ing up this bipartisan Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2021 on this date. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO); the gentleman 
from California (Mr. CARBAJAL); the 
ranking member, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. GRAVES); and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) for work-
ing with me and my Republican coun-
terpart, the gentleman from South Da-
kota (Mr. JOHNSON) to get this result. 
I will very, very briefly go through 
what the bill attempts to do. We are all 
aware that the pandemic highlighted 
the longstanding issues of the ocean 
shipping industry and also the stag-
gering vulnerabilities in the integral 
supply chain that drives global com-
merce. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
would be the first overhaul of Federal 
regulations for the international ocean 
shipping industry since 1998. For dec-
ades, the United States has run a sig-
nificant trade imbalance, due in large 
part 
to 
export-driven, 
nonmarket 
economies like mainland China. 
In 2001, the People’s Republic of 
China was granted permanent normal 
trade relations with the United States, 
the so-called most favored nation sta-
tus, following that country’s admission 
to the World Trade Organization. There 
has since been considerable consolida-
tion among the foreign-based ocean 
carriers, coinciding with the continued 
decline 
of 
the 
U.S.-flagged 
inter-
national fleet in favor of foreign flags 
of convenience. 
A handful of foreign-flagged ocean 
carriers now dominate the global ocean 
shipping industry, three of which are 
from China, another from Korea, and a 
fifth from Europe, several of which are 
effectively controlled by these foreign 
governments. Foreign business access 
to the American market and our con-
sumers is a privilege; it is not a right. 
In 2001, the United States’ trade im-
balance with the People’s Republic of 
China was approximately $83 billion in 
nominal dollars. In 2020, our trade im-
balance with mainland China was $310 
billion, having increased year over year 
most every year. 
This legislation would ensure recip-
rocal trade to help reduce the United 
States’ longstanding trade imbalance 
with 
export-driven 
countries 
like 
China. 
California agricultural exporters and 
other businesses are willing to pay to 
ensure that their products reach mar-
kets in Asia, but they can’t pay a for-
tune to do it. One example, Jelly Belly, 
the candy company in my district, last 
spring would pay $3,000 for a container 
full of candy to ship to the Western Pa-
cific. Today it is $31,900. That is the 
problem. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act does 
make critical reforms requested by 
major U.S. importers, like the National 
Retail Federation’s member compa-
nies. There are many, many examples. 
I will let those go for now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
It is impossible for any American to 
ignore the supply chain crunch, a sup-
ply chain crunch that seemingly im-
pacts most every part of the American 
economy. 
In that kind of an environment, I 
want to echo so much of what my 
friend from California said. I am indeed 
thrilled that the House is taking up 
this bill today. I am grateful for his 
leadership. I am grateful to be the lead 
Republican on this, and I am grateful 
that this bill has been endorsed by 360 
national, State, and local groups. This 
is much-needed legislation. 
How did we get here? With a massive 
influx of Federal dollars into the econ-
omy and with COVID–19 changing how 
Americans purchase goods, for more 
than a year, United States ports have 
faced unprecedented volumes of cargo. 
Some estimates say that American de-
mand for consumer electronics has 
gone 
up 
40 
percent 
compared 
to 
prepandemic. This pressure on our 
ports has trickled down to every other 
part of the supply chain, leading to 
what Americans have seen: delays and 
product shortages. 
Now, those constraints and the re-
sulting extremely high shipping rates 
have made it more difficult not just for 
our country to receive imports but also 
for us to ship our manufactured goods 
and agricultural goods out to the rest 
of the world. 
b 1100 
We have seen unprecedented rejec-
tion of American container loads by 
the large ocean carriers. They are in 
contravention of their contractual ob-
ligations, just refusing to haul that 
cargo, preferring instead to take the 
empty containers and get them back to 
Asia for a quick turn. That has caused 
serious problems, not just conceptual 
dollars, real dollars, real cents. The 
American dairy industry has seen $1 
billion worth of losses just in the first 
6 months of this year. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I am a big fan of 
the free market, but the free market is 
many buyers and many sellers, and 
that 
is 
not 
in 
place 
today. 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI so rightfully talked about 
the consolidation we have seen in this 
industry. And indeed, 30 years ago the 
largest foreign-flagged ocean carriers 
controlled about 15 percent of this traf-
fic. Today, they control about 75 per-
cent. That is not quite the free market 
that we used to have. 
And so, H.R. 4996, the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2021 helps to address 
these supply chain bottlenecks. It 
helps to promote American competi-
tiveness. And it holds accountable 
these foreign-flagged ocean carriers, 
which I would note are increasingly 
dominated by Chinese state-backed 
firms. 
Now, let me be honest and let me be 
clear, this bill is no silver bullet, but 
shame on us if we fail to act. This sup-
ply chain crunch has laid bare the defi-
ciencies in the marketplace, and we 
have an opportunity today to address 
many of those deficiencies. 
Probably the most common question, 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues ask of me 
about this bill is why a Congressman 
from the plains of South Dakota would 
be so interested in maritime law. I 
would just remind them of the world’s 
great hunger for American beef, Amer-
ican beans, American corn, and Amer-
ican dairy. Indeed, 60 percent of South 
Dakota’s soybeans are exported abroad. 
In that environment this is not just a 
coastal issue, but it is an issue that im-
pacts lives from the farm gate to every 
Main Street. 
And indeed, I have been hearing from 
South Dakota businesses like Strider 
Sports International in Rapid City to 
Valley Queen, a cheese processor in 
Milbank, and they are telling me about 
how these issues are having a real im-
pact on dollars and cents. 
Valley Queen has two million pounds 
of lactose. This is a product that has 
already been sold to Asian markets, 
and it is just sitting there in their 
warehouses waiting for an opening at

the ports. A recent container load of 
this lactose waited on the ports, Mr. 
Speaker, for 75 days. The lactose began 
to turn, and, of course, that meant a 
big deduction on the price that Valley 
Queen could get for that lactose. Just a 
destruction of American value. 
This bill is about American competi-
tiveness. Broadly speaking, the legisla-
tion provides the Federal Maritime 
Commission—that is the cop on the 
beat—the tools they need to make sure 
that this system runs more efficiently 
and runs more fairly and makes sure 
that the interests of the foreign- 
flagged 
ocean 
carriers 
are 
better 
aligned with the interests of American 
shippers. 
So the bill does a number of things, 
but I will quickly hit on just five. 
First off, under this bill the FMC can 
set minimum standards for ocean ship-
ping that makes sure that U.S. ship-
pers are protected from the actions of 
others which leave export cargoes 
stranded at U.S. ports. 
Number two, it protects U.S. shippers 
from retaliation if they file a com-
plaint with the FMC. 
Number three, this bill prohibits the 
foreign-flagged ocean carriers from un-
reasonably denying American export 
cargo on their vessels. 
Number four, it requires foreign 
ocean carriers to certify the accuracy 
of the detention and demurrage fees. 
These are fines they can hit shippers 
with; they have to certify that those 
fines are accurate. 
And number five, it would authorize 
the National Academy of Sciences to 
study how best to improve trans-
parency in the supply chain. 
Now, I just don’t know, Mr. Speaker, 
how any of my colleagues can allege 
any of these things are not reasonable. 
These are very basic guardrails. These 
are very basic rules of the road that 
people who are using American ports 
should be obligated to follow. 
And so the choice for my colleagues 
is simple, a vote for H.R. 4996 is a vote 
to put U.S. shippers, manufacturing, 
farmers, truckers, retailers, and con-
sumers first. That is where they should 
be. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) who alerted me 
to this problem early last summer. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman JOHN GARAMENDI, a friend 
and a person who I have worked with 
on a host of issues over the years, and 
Congressman DUSTY JOHNSON. This is a 
good example of what bipartisan co-
operation is all about. Mr. Speaker, I 
commend Congressman GARAMENDI’s 
leadership in this effort—a member of 
the subcommittee and the full com-
mittee—with Congressman DEFAZIO in 
working out the differences, which was 
important. 
Having said that, the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act, of which I am a cosponsor, 
is the first major update in Federal 
regulations for global ocean shipping 
since 1998. Think about how much the 
world has changed in 23 years in terms 
of trade. 
This legislation, as I said, is a result 
of bipartisan efforts. 
This legislation supports U.S. export-
ers who have been disproportionately 
impacted by unfair trade practices in 
our ports and harbors. 
No ship arriving with imports should 
leave an American port empty when 
products are ready to go, and that is 
what is happening, sadly. 
Enacting strong regulatory frame-
work will help end these disruptions to 
deal with the issue of demurrage and 
backup on the supply chain that has 
created this bottleneck. 
We can and must do more to ensure 
that all exporters in this country have 
a fair and level playing field. California 
agricultural producers, as well as other 
U.S. exporters should be able to ship 
their products without unnecessary 
delays. It is a national security issue. 
The 
increased 
shipping 
container 
costs and delays exporters are facing 
only continue to impact our recovery 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Let me give you a local example. 
California is our Nation’s largest agri-
cultural producer and exporter with 
more than 400 commodities, over a 
third of the Nation’s vegetables and 
two-thirds of the Nation’s fruits and 
nuts. Forty-four percent of California’s 
agriculture production is exported. 
The San Pedro Bay Complex, which 
we otherwise call the Los Angeles and 
Long Beach Ports in southern Cali-
fornia is the ninth busiest in the world 
and provides importation of 40 percent 
of the container industry in America. 
Think about that. This is where the 
bottleneck is most acute. 
It is necessary that we utilize all re-
sources to reduce port congestion and 
empower the Federal Maritime Com-
mission to do what they can and should 
do. This is about short-term and long- 
term solutions to relieve the bottle-
neck in this supply chain. This is about 
an effort to, in fact, provide relief that 
benefits American workers, American 
consumers. It is about the economic re-
covery; it is about trade; and it is 
about jobs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. It is a part of the short-term and 
long-term solution. I recommend a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I would just note Mr. COSTA’s 
unyielding advocacy of this project, 
this issue and thank him for that sup-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Representative JOHNSON
for 
yielding, and I thank him for his pas-
sion to address the supply shipping cri-
sis that we are facing in our Nation 
today. 
I, too, rise today in strong support of 
the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021. 
This is a bipartisan bill I was proud to 
cosponsor that would help address the 
container ship bottlenecks at the San 
Pedro Complex, which includes the 
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in 
southern California near my district, 
California’s 39th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
While this bill is not a silver bullet 
to resolving all of our supply chain 
issues like major labor shortages and 
warehouses overcapacity, it does take 
meaningful steps to address uncom-
petitive practices by some ocean car-
riers. 
H.R. 4996 provides the Federal Mari-
time Commission with more tools to 
address practices that discriminate 
against 
U.S. 
exporters, 
importers, 
truckers, and other players in our sup-
ply chain. 
Bottlenecks at the San Pedro Com-
plex continue to cause supply disrup-
tions that are raising prices for work-
ers, families, and small businesses and 
hurts the ability of our manufacturers 
and farmers to export goods overseas. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
4996. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington State (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I am so proud to represent Washing-
ton’s Eighth Congressional District, 
which stretches from the suburbs of Se-
attle in the west across the Cascade 
Mountains into the rich farmland of 
central Washington. It is home to some 
of the Nation’s largest agricultural 
producers and exporters whose hay, ap-
ples, pears, and cherries are in high de-
mand all around the world. 
For more than a year, these export-
ers have shared with me how pandemic 
conditions and the behavior of foreign- 
owned shipping carriers are hurting 
their industries, threatening export 
markets and relationships that they 
have developed over decades. 
They often don’t know when a ship 
will be in port, making it difficult to 
get their products to the carrier in 
time. They are forced to pay additional 
fees when their products—often perish-
able ones—have to wait at the port to 
be loaded on to a ship. 
And shipping carriers are opting to 
return as many empty containers to 
China as possible for fast turnaround 
and their own bottom line, rather than 
accepting U.S. exports. It is better for 
them financially to return to China 
with empty containers to bring back 
TVs, iPads, and just about everything 
else we buy from Amazon versus bring-
ing back Eighth District hay or agri-
cultural goods. This rejection threat-
ens to upend our Nation’s agricultural 
industry and relationships built over 
decades for years to come. 
I was proud to cosponsor the Ocean 
Shipping Reform Act of 2021 together 
with 
Congressmen 
GARAMENDI
and 
JOHNSON. I thank them for their sup-
port. This is a great bipartisan bill

that will make a real difference for ex-
porters in my district, and I encourage 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of H.R. 4996, the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act. 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
JOHNSON, 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI, and others for joining me 
in raising the alarm back in March in 
a letter to the Federal Maritime Com-
mission about the empty container 
ships leaving American ports. 
This bill follows on that effort, offer-
ing necessary reforms to Federal regu-
lations overseeing the ocean shipping 
industry in order to address problems 
like this that have been discussed. 
Agricultural exports are critical to 
not only feeding the world but to the 
livelihood of the producers I represent 
in Nebraska. 
We cannot do that if container ships 
leave 
American 
ports 
completely 
empty. 
This bill prohibits foreign ocean car-
riers from refusing U.S. exports unrea-
sonably and gives the FMC more tools 
to ensure these carriers are held ac-
countable and held to a high standard. 
Trade only works if exports reach 
their final destination in a reliable and 
affordable way. 
This bill is great step toward facili-
tating exactly that. 
It is a reasonable bill, and I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CARBAJAL). 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to express my support for the bipar-
tisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, a bi-
partisan agreement that Representa-
tives GARAMENDI
and JOHNSON
have 
reached. I thank my colleagues for 
working with me and Congressman 
DEFAZIO on this legislation. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
Coast Guard and Maritime Transpor-
tation, I have held hearings on the on-
going supply chain disruptions and met 
with countless stakeholders and con-
stituents who are feeling the impacts 
of the disruptions, including those who 
suffered wrongdoing by ocean carriers. 
This legislation is a big step toward ad-
dressing this. 
The increase in funding for the Fed-
eral Maritime Commission, FMC, in 
this 2-year authorization is indicative 
of this body’s strong support for find-
ing an effective solution to the pan-
demic supply chain crisis. 
b 1115 
Now is the time to ensure that the 
Commission has the ability to enforce 
fairness in ocean carrier practices. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the 
bill contains a number of provisions 
aimed at addressing wrongfully issued 
detention and demurrage fees and com-
plements President Biden’s actions to 
address this issue. The bill also in-
cludes several reporting requirements 
on issues of maritime cargo flow at 
U.S. ports and anticompetitive busi-
ness practices. 
By addressing these challenges, Con-
gress seeks to counter trade imbal-
ances with foreign exporting countries, 
making reciprocal trade one of the 
FMC’s missions. 
I am proud of the committee’s work 
on this important legislation, and I 
look forward to ensuring that this leg-
islation, H.R. 4996, is signed into law. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. CARBAJAL for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. GIBBS), the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Coast Guard and Maritime Trans-
portation. 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representatives DUSTY
JOHNSON
and 
JOHN GARAMENDI for their work on this 
bill. 
While I support this bill, I do have 
concerns 
about 
the 
process 
under 
which it has been brought to the floor, 
and whether, by itself, it will have 
much impact on the supply difficulties 
we are currently facing. 
Neither a hearing nor a markup was 
held on this bill. Given its complexity, 
I believe a hearing and a markup would 
have given Members a better oppor-
tunity to fully understand and perhaps 
improve the bill. 
The bill gives the Federal Maritime 
Commission, the FMC, enhanced au-
thorities to prevent ocean carriers, 
who operate ships in the container 
trade, from engaging in anticompeti-
tive activities in regards to shippers, 
and give shippers enhanced input into 
the FMC complaint process. 
I have concerns about giving bureau-
crats at the Federal Maritime Commis-
sion more authority to insert them-
selves into privately held contractual 
agreements. However, it appears to a 
great extent, the delays, port conges-
tion, and higher shipping prices are due 
primarily to short-term contracts, un-
willingness or inability to share data 
by all parties to operate efficiently, 
equipment shortages, lack of ware-
house space, chassis truck and train 
capacity, and labor issues, rather than 
anticompetitive practices by ocean 
shippers. 
If ocean carriers were the sole prob-
lem, we would not see container ships 
waiting for weeks to unload. Ag ex-
ports are at record highs for some com-
modities, and it is unfortunate that 
some of the ag shipments have not 
been able to make it on ships in a time-
ly and efficient manner. However, it is 
not clear to me that the decision that 
led to these products from being 
stranded are due to practices that are 
anticompetitive under U.S. law. 
This bill would prohibit carriers from 
unreasonably declining cargo that can 
be safely and timely loaded and is 
going to a port on the ship’s itinerary. 
It will be curious to see how often this 
provision is used. 
As I said, I am willing to support this 
bill to assure that detention and de-
murrage is used as an incentive to 
move cargo efficiently, not—as some 
have claimed—as an indiscriminate 
corporate profit center, and to provide 
shippers additional protections. 
However, as has been said by the 
sponsor, this bill isn’t perfect and there 
is still more work to be done. I expect 
it to address the supply chain more 
broadly and not assume that alleged 
anticompetitive behavior by ocean car-
riers is the sole cause of the current 
supply chain disruption. 
The legislation needed must, number 
one, be comprehensive and look at 
long-term port truck chassis, train, 
intermodal connection, and warehouse 
capacity needs. 
Two, assure the availability of trans-
parent, enforceable contracts to assure 
goods can be shipped at the agreed 
time and cost; 
And three, improve data sharing 
among the parties in the supply to as-
sure that everyone knows where and 
when they must have equipment to 
move containers efficiently. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation and ask that we continue to 
work to address the whole supply chain 
crisis. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 10 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from South 
Dakota has 71⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take an opportunity 
to thank Chair DEFAZIO and Ranking 
Member GRAVES for the various hear-
ings they have had in talking with 
Chairman Maffei, Commissioner Dye, 
and others on the FMC about these 
issues. I thank Mr. GARAMENDI and oth-
ers for bringing up this legislation in a 
number of hearings we have had on the 
supply chain crunch. I think it has 
helped to fill out the record on these 
incredibly important issues and the 
role that this legislation can play in 
advancing this cause. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman JOHNSON for yielding and 
for his support on this important legis-
lation today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 
2021. Throughout the pandemic, I heard 
from Georgia farmers who were unable 
to access affordable shipping. Agri-
culture is the largest industry in my 
district and the largest industry in the 
State of Georgia. Our ports are a crit-
ical part of our Nation’s infrastructure 
and it should be considered a great 
honor and privilege for any inter-
national company or entity to have ac-
cess to them. 
Foreign players gain access to the 
largest consumer market on earth 
through our ports, with a GDP of $20 
trillion and 325 million people. Yet,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7479 
December 8, 2021 
American farmers face high fees and 
barriers to getting their commodities 
into shipping containers. 
After defying the odds of weather and 
many other issues that our farmers 
face, it is unconscionable that our per-
ishable exports are left sitting in ware-
houses to rot. 
This bill provides the first significant 
Federal update of the Federal Mari-
time Commission’s powers since 1998 
and will significantly improve our 
farmers’ access to affordable shipping. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor 
of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 
2021, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important bill. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, there are a few things 
that I know for sure. The first is that 
when you use American ports you 
should be subjected to some very basic 
rules of the road. Things like not being 
allowed to unreasonably discriminate 
against American cargo, that is one 
thing I know for sure. 
Another thing I know for sure is that 
although this bill is not a silver bullet, 
and nobody is alleging that it is only 
the ocean carriers that are responsible 
for this supply chain crunch, this will 
help. This better aligns the interests of 
the ocean carriers with the interests of 
American manufacturers and American 
farmers and ranchers. That will go a 
long way toward helping to resolve the 
supply chain crunch. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, one more thing 
that I know for sure, and that is when 
you have 360 national, State, and local 
groups, when you have 90 Members of 
Congress, when you have a bipartisan 
coalition that has come together to 
embrace this concept in what is all too 
often a partisan environment, then I 
think you know you have a good policy 
solution. 
With that in mind, I once again 
thank the gentleman from California 
for his leadership, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to support the bill, and ask 
the Senate for their expeditious consid-
eration of it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Occasionally, we toss words back and 
forth across the aisle here, and I would 
like to toss a word back across the 
aisle to Mr. JOHNSON. 
He said compliments my way. The 
actual compliments go his way. It is 
not often that we spend time, and we 
spend a good deal of time working to-
gether on these bills, and we ought to 
do more across the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure 
working with Mr. JOHNSON
and his 
team, and I thank him. I thank him for 
stepping forward, as have other Mem-
bers on your side and my side of the 
aisle, stepping forward and saying, 
Hey, there is a problem. It is a problem 
out there. There are problems of reten-
tion and demurrage charges that are, 
Well, how could that be. 
An importer of plastic Christmas 
trees and wreaths and other ornaments 
from China could not get his con-
tainers off of the port. Yet, he was 
being charged $4 million, which pretty 
much puts him out of business. He is 
not the biggest company in the world, 
but he would like to be. And given the 
unfair situation that he was facing, he 
may never become a major company in 
the United States. So we need to set up 
rules of the road, words that Mr. JOHN-
SON laid out so clearly. Rules of the 
road; the guardrails. Within these 
rules, operations, free enterprise, mar-
ket competition can take place, but 
right now, it is a wide-open system in 
which there is a gunfight on the street, 
and that is leading to companies not 
being able to get their goods on the 
ships to export. 
And comments that you have already 
heard from Mr. COSTA, California is a 
big agricultural export, and so is South 
Dakota, and so is the Midwest, and so 
is the Southeast. All of America wants 
to export, but when you cannot get a 
container, you are not going to export 
and you are likely to be out of busi-
ness, and you are going to incur a very, 
very significant charge. 
So we set up a system in which these 
charges and the availability are regu-
lated in a mechanism that will be con-
ducted by the Federal Maritime Com-
mission. We can go on and on here, and 
we probably ought to, but I won’t take 
my full 10 minutes. I will say, as Mr. 
JOHNSON said earlier, this isn’t the sil-
ver bullet, this isn’t going to solve all 
the problems, but when you consider 
what has already occurred in legisla-
tion here—specifically, the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act, that 
piece of legislation will provide $2.5 bil-
lion to the ports so that they can up-
grade their facilities, so that they can, 
the next time around, be able to avoid 
the kind of congestion that is plaguing 
all of the commerce in this Nation. 
We also look to the Build Back Bet-
ter legislation, which has another $2.5 
billion in it to deal with additional in-
frastructure that is necessary to con-
nect the ports to the rest of the trans-
portation system in this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, we need this bill. We, 
the American farmer, needs this bill. 
We, the American export industry— 
whether it is heavy, light—and the im-
port community, all need this bill. So I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and in that process, we will, I 
believe, have a much better market 
system here in the United States, one 
that has guardrails, one that provides 
an equitable and balanced system for 
the importers and the exporters. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take an op-
portunity here to thank some very im-
portant people. The staff that put this 
together, on our side of the aisle, Matt 
Dwyer, the lead person on the Sub-
committee on Coast Guard and Mari-
time Transportation; CheriAnn Thomp-
son 
on 
that 
committee; 
Cheryl 
Dickson; and Iain Hart from my own 
staff. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. 
JOHNSON) if he would like to thank his 
staff. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
would 
just 
echo 
the 
thoughts of Mr. GARAMENDI that there 
have been so many who have worked 
together, and really a broad national 
coalition, and he is exactly right to 
call attention to the people who do the 
work behind the scenes. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
GARAMENDI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4996, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

ADJUSTABLE INTEREST RATE 
(LIBOR) ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4616) to deem certain references 
to LIBOR as referring to a replacement 
benchmark rate upon the occurrence of 
certain events affecting LIBOR, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4616 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Adjustable 
Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
(1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in 
more than $200 trillion of contracts world-
wide; 
(2) a significant number of existing con-
tracts that reference LIBOR do not provide 
for the use of a clearly defined or practicable 
replacement benchmark rate when LIBOR is 
discontinued; and 
(3) the cessation or non-representativeness 
of LIBOR could result in disruptive litiga-
tion related to existing contracts that do not 
provide for the use of a clearly defined or 
practicable replacement benchmark rate. 
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this 
Act— 
(1) to establish a clear and uniform proc-
ess, on a nationwide basis, for replacing 
LIBOR in existing contracts the terms of 
which do not provide for the use of a clearly 
defined or practicable replacement bench-
mark rate, without affecting the ability of

parties to use any appropriate benchmark 
rate in new contracts; 
(2) to preclude litigation related to exist-
ing contracts the terms of which do not pro-
vide for the use of a clearly defined or prac-
ticable replacement benchmark rate; and 
(3) to allow existing contracts that ref-
erence LIBOR but provide for the use of a 
clearly defined fallback and practicable re-
placement rate, to operate according to their 
terms. 
(c) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this Act shall be construed to disfavor the 
use of any benchmark rate on a prospective 
basis. 
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 
As used in this Act, the following terms 
shall have the following meanings: 
(1) ‘‘Benchmark’’ shall mean an index of

in whole or in part, as the basis of or as a ref-
erence for calculating or determining any 
valuation, payment or other measurement. 
(2) ‘‘Benchmark Administrator’’ means a 
person that publishes a Benchmark for use 
by third parties. 
(3) ‘‘Benchmark Replacement’’ shall mean 
a Benchmark, or an interest rate or dividend 
rate (which may or may not be based in 
whole or in part on a prior setting of 
LIBOR), to replace LIBOR or any interest 
rate or dividend rate based on LIBOR, 
whether on a temporary, permanent, or in-
definite basis, under or in respect of a LIBOR 
Contract. 
(4) ‘‘Benchmark Replacement Conforming 
Changes’’ shall mean any technical, adminis-
trative, or operational changes, alterations,

(A) the Board determines, in its discretion, 
would address one or more issues affecting

mark Replacement in LIBOR contracts; or 
(B) solely with respect to a LIBOR Con-
tract that is not a Consumer Loan, in the 
reasonable judgment of a Calculating Per-
son, are otherwise necessary or appropriate

SEC. 4. LIBOR CONTRACTS. 
(a) On the LIBOR Replacement Date, the 
Board-Selected 
Benchmark 
Replacement 
shall, by operation of law, be the Benchmark 
Replacement for any LIBOR Contract that, 
after giving any effect to subsection (b)— 
(1) contains no Fallback Provisions; or 
(2) contains Fallback Provisions that iden-
tify neither— 
(A) a specific Benchmark Replacement; nor 
(B) a Determining Person. 
(b) On the LIBOR Replacement Date, any 
references in the Fallback Provisions of a 
LIBOR Contract to— 
(1) a Benchmark Replacement that is based 
in any way on any LIBOR value, except to 
account for the difference between LIBOR 
and the Benchmark Replacement, or 
(2) a requirement that a person (other than 
a Benchmark Administrator) conduct a poll, 
survey, or inquiries for quotes or informa-
tion concerning interbank lending or deposit 
rates, 
shall be disregarded as if not included in the 
Fallback Provisions of such LIBOR Contract 
and shall be deemed null and void and with-
out any force or effect. 
(c) Subject to subsection (g)(2), a Deter-
mining Person shall have authority under 
this Act, but shall not be required, to select 
the Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement 
as the Benchmark Replacement. 
(d) Any selection by a Determining Person 
of the Board-Selected Benchmark Replace-
ment pursuant to subsection (c) shall be— 
(1) irrevocable; 
(2) made by the earlier of the LIBOR Re-
placement Date and the latest date for se-
lecting a Benchmark Replacement according 
to the terms of such LIBOR Contract; and 
(3) used in any determinations of the 
Benchmark under or in respect of such 
LIBOR Contract occurring on and after the 
LIBOR Replacement Date. 
(e) If a Determining Person has authority 
to select the Board-Selected Benchmark Re-
placement under subsection (c) but does not 
select a Benchmark Replacement by the date 
specified in subsection (d)(2), then, on the 
LIBOR Replacement Date, the Board-Se-
lected Benchmark Replacement shall, by op-
eration of law, be the Benchmark Replace-
ment for the LIBOR Contract. 
(f) If the Board-Selected Benchmark Re-
placement becomes the Benchmark Replace-
ment for a LIBOR Contract pursuant to sub-
section (a), (c), or (e) then all Benchmark 
Replacement Conforming Changes shall be-
come an integral part of such LIBOR Con-
tract by operation of law. For the avoidance 
of doubt, a Calculating Person shall not be 
required to obtain consent from any other 
person prior to the adoption of Benchmark 
Replacement Conforming Changes. 
(g) The provisions of this Act shall not 
alter or impair— 
(1) any written agreement specifying that 
a LIBOR Contract shall not be subject to 
this Act; 
(2) any LIBOR Contract that contains Fall-
back Provisions that identify a Benchmark 
Replacement that is not based in any way on 
any LIBOR value (including, but not limited 
to, the prime rate or the Effective Federal 
Funds Rate), except that such LIBOR Con-
tract shall be subject to subsection (b); 
(3) any LIBOR Contract subject to sub-
section (c) as to which a Determining Person 
does not elect to use a Board-Selected 
Benchmark Replacement pursuant to sub-
section (c), except to the extent that such 
LIBOR Contract is subject to subsection (b) 
or (e); 
(4) the application to a Board-Selected 
Benchmark Replacement of any cap, floor, 
modifier, or spread adjustment to which 
LIBOR had been subject pursuant to the 
terms of a LIBOR Contract; or 
(5) any provisions of Federal consumer fi-
nancial law that require creditors to notify 
borrowers regarding a change-in-terms or 
that govern the reevaluation of rate in-
creases on credit card accounts under open- 
end (not home-secured) consumer credit 
plans. 
(h) Except as provided in section 5(c), the 
provisions of this Act shall not alter or im-
pair the rights or obligations of any person, 
or the authorities of any agency, under Fed-
eral consumer financial law (as defined in 
section 1002(14) of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(12 U.S.C. 5481(14)). 
SEC. 5. CONTINUITY OF CONTRACT AND SAFE 
HARBOR. 
(a) A Board-Selected Benchmark Replace-
ment and the selection or use of a Board-Se-
lected Benchmark Replacement as a Bench-
mark Replacement under or in respect of a 
LIBOR Contract, as well as any Benchmark 
Replacement Conforming Changes, by oper-
ation of section 4 shall constitute— 
(1) a commercially reasonable replacement 
for and a commercially substantial equiva-
lent to LIBOR; 
(2) a reasonable, comparable, or analogous 
rate, index, or term for LIBOR; 
(3) a replacement that is based on a meth-
odology or information that is similar or 
comparable to LIBOR; 
(4) substantial performance by any person 
of any right or obligation relating to or 
based on LIBOR; and

(5) a replacement that has historical fluc-
tuations that are substantially similar to 
those of LIBOR for purposes of the Truth in 
Lending Act and its implementing regula-
tions. 
(b) Neither of (1) the selection or use of a 
Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement as 
a Benchmark Replacement or (2) the deter-
mination, implementation, or performance 
of 
Benchmark 
Replacement 
Conforming 
Changes, in each case by operation of section 
4, shall (A) be deemed to impair or affect the 
right of any person to receive a payment, or 
to affect the amount or timing of such pay-
ment, under any LIBOR Contract or (B) have 
the effect of (i) discharging or excusing per-
formance under any LIBOR Contract for any 
reason, claim, or defense (including, but not 
limited to, any force majeure or other provi-
sion in any LIBOR Contract), (ii) giving any 
person the right to unilaterally terminate or 
suspend performance under any LIBOR Con-
tract, (iii) constituting a breach of any 
LIBOR Contract, or (iv) voiding or nullifying 
any LIBOR Contract. 
(c) No person shall be subject to any claim 
or cause of action in law or equity or request 
for equitable relief, or have liability for dam-
ages, arising out of— 
(1) the selection or use of a Board-Selected 
Benchmark Replacement, 
(2) the implementation of Benchmark Re-
placement Conforming Changes, or 
(3) with respect to a LIBOR Contract that 
is not a Consumer Loan, the determination 
of 
Benchmark 
Replacement 
Conforming 
Changes, 
in each case after giving effect to the provi-
sions of section 4; provided, however, that in 
each case any person (including a Calcu-
lating Person) shall remain subject to the 
terms of a LIBOR Contract that are not af-
fected by this Act and any existing legal, 
regulatory, or contractual obligations to 
correct servicing or other ministerial errors 
under or in respect of a LIBOR Contract. 
(d) The selection or use of a Board-Selected 
Benchmark Replacement or the determina-
tion, implementation, or performance of 
Benchmark 
Replacement 
Conforming 
Changes, in each case by operation of section 
4, shall not be deemed to— 
(1) be an amendment or modification of 
any LIBOR Contract for the purpose of the 
governing law of such LIBOR Contract; or 
(2) prejudice, impair, or affect any person’s 
rights, interests, or obligations under or in 
respect of any LIBOR Contract. 
(e) Except as provided in either subsections 
(a), (b), or (c) of section 4, the provisions of 
this Act shall not be interpreted as creating 
any negative inference or negative presump-
tion regarding the validity or enforceability 
of— 
(1) any Benchmark Replacement (including 
any method for calculating, determining, or 
implementing an adjustment to the Bench-
mark Replacement to account for any his-
torical differences between LIBOR and the 
Benchmark Replacement) that is not a 
Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement; or 
(2) any changes, alterations, or modifica-
tions to or in respect of a LIBOR Contract 
that are not Benchmark Replacement Con-
forming Changes. 
SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. 
(a) This Act and the regulations hereunder 
shall supersede any and all laws, statutes, 
rules, regulations, or standards of any State, 
the District of Columbia, or any territory or 
possession of the United States, insofar as 
they provide for the selection or use of a 
Benchmark Replacement or related con-
forming changes. 
(b) No provision of State or local law that 
expressly limits the manner of calculating 
interest, including the compounding of inter-
est, shall apply to the selection or use of a 
Board-Selected Benchmark Replacement or 
Benchmark 
Replacement 
Conforming 
Changes. 
SEC. 7. TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939. 
Section 316 of the Trust Indenture Act of 
1939 (15 U.S.C. 77ppp) is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘and’’ after ‘‘of subsection 
(a),’’ in subsection (b); and 
(2) by inserting ‘‘, and except that the right 
of any holder of any indenture security to re-
ceive payment of the principal of and inter-
est on such indenture security shall not be 
deemed to be impaired or affected by any 
change occurring by the application of sec-
tion 4 of the Adjustable Interest Rate 
(LIBOR) Act of 2021 to any indenture secu-
rity’’ after ‘‘subject to such lien’’ in sub-
section (b). 
SEC. 8. RULEMAKING. 
Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Board shall issue 
such regulations as may be necessary or ap-
propriate to enable it to administer and 
carry out the purposes of this Act. 
SEC. 9. REVISED CALCULATION RULE TO AD-
DRESS INSTANCES WHERE 1-MONTH 
USD LIBOR CEASES OR IS NON-REP-
RESENTATIVE. 
Section 438(b)(2)(I) of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087–1(b)(2)(I)) is amend-
ed by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(viii) REVISED CALCULATION RULE TO AD-
DRESS INSTANCES WHERE 1-MONTH USD LIBOR 
CEASES OR IS NON-REPRESENTATIVE.— 
‘‘(I) SUBSTITUTE
REFERENCE
INDEX.—The 
provisions of this clause apply to loans for 
which the special allowance payment would 
otherwise be calculated pursuant to clause 
(vii). 
‘‘(II) CALCULATION
BASED
ON
SOFR.—For 
loans described in subclause (III) or (IV), the 
special allowance payment described in this 
subclause shall be substituted for the pay-
ment provided under clause (vii). For each 
calendar quarter, the formula for computing 
the special allowance that would otherwise 
apply under clause (vii) shall be revised by 
substituting ‘of the quotes of the 30-day Av-
erage Secured Overnight Financing Rate 
(SOFR) in effect for each of the days in such 
quarter as published by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York (or a successor adminis-
trator), adjusted daily by adding the Tenor 
Spread Adjustment, as that term is defined 
in the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act 
of 2021, for 1-month LIBOR contracts of 
0.11448 percent’ for ‘of the 1-month London 
Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for United 
States dollars in effect for each of the days 
in such quarter as compiled and released by 
the British Bankers Association’. The special 
allowance calculation for loans subject to 
clause (vii) shall otherwise remain in effect. 
‘‘(III) LOANS ELIGIBLE FOR SOFR-BASED CAL-
CULATION.—Except as provided in subclause 
(IV), the special allowance payment cal-
culated under subclause (II) shall apply to all 
loans for which the holder (or, if the holder 
acts as an eligible lender trustee for the ben-
eficial owner of the loan, the beneficial 
owner of the loan) at any time after the ef-
fective date of this clause notifies the Sec-
retary that the holder or beneficial owner af-
firmatively and permanently elects to waive 
all contractual, statutory, or other legal 
rights to a special allowance paid under 
clause (vii) or to the special allowance paid 
pursuant to any other formula that was pre-
viously in effect with respect to such loan, 
and accepts the rate described in subclause 
(II). Any such waiver shall apply to all loans 
then held, or to be held from time to time, 
by such holder or beneficial owner; provided 
that, due to the need to obtain the approval 
of one of the following, demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary— 
‘‘(aa) one or more third parties with a legal 
or beneficial interest in loans eligible for the 
SOFR-based calculation, or 
‘‘(bb) a nationally recognized rating orga-
nization assigning a rating to a financing se-
cured by loans otherwise eligible for the 
SOFR-based calculation, 
the holder of the loan (or, if the holder acts 
as an eligible lender trustee for the bene-
ficial owner of the loan, the beneficial owner 
of the loan) may elect to apply the rate de-
scribed in subclause (II) to specified loan 
portfolios established for financing purposes 
by separate notices with different effective 
dates. The special allowance rate based on 
SOFR shall be effective with respect to a 
portfolio as of the first day of the calendar 
quarter following the applicable effective 
date of the waiver received by the Secretary 
from the holder or beneficial owner and shall 
permanently and irrevocably continue for all 
subsequent quarters. 
‘‘(IV) FALLBACK PROVISIONS.— 
‘‘(aa) In the event that a holder or bene-
ficial owner has not elected to waive its 
rights to a special allowance payment under 
clause (vii) with respect to a portfolio with 
an effective date of the waiver prior to the 
first of— 
‘‘(AA) the date on which the ICE Bench-
mark Administration (‘IBA’) has perma-
nently or indefinitely stopped providing the 
1-month United States Dollar LIBOR (‘1- 
month USD LIBOR’) to the general public, 
‘‘(BB) the effective date of an official pub-
lic statement by the IBA or its regulator 
that the 1-month USD LIBOR is no longer re-
liable or no longer representative, or 
‘‘(CC) the LIBOR Replacement Date, as 
that term is defined in section 3 of the Ad-
justable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021, 
the special allowance rate calculation as de-
scribed in subclause (II) shall, by operation 
of law, apply to all loans in such portfolio. 
‘‘(bb) In such event— 
‘‘(AA) the last determined rate of special 
allowance based on 1-month USD LIBOR will 
continue to apply until the end of the then 
current calendar quarter; and 
‘‘(BB) the special allowance rate calcula-
tion as described in subclause (II) shall be-
come effective as of the first day of the fol-
lowing calendar quarter and remain in effect 
for all subsequent calendar quarters.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SHERMAN) and the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this leg-
islation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today we show that the 
House of Representatives can deal with 
a really big problem before it becomes 
a crisis and before almost anybody 
even knows that there is a problem. We 
can deal with such a problem without 
drama, without deadlock, without par-
tisanship. We can do it a year and a 
half before it all explodes, so as to give 
the Senate, the regulatory agencies,

and the private sector the time that 
they need to do this job long before the 
impending uncertainty disrupts our 
economy. 
As co-chair of the CPA Caucus, I am 
here to certify that this is the most 
important genuinely boring bill that 
will come before this House this year. 
Mr. Speaker, there are trillions of 
outstanding loans that have adjustable 
interest rates. The adjustment of these 
loans is tied to the London Interbank 
Offered 
Rates, 
known 
as 
LIBOR. 
LIBOR has been referred to as the most 
important interest rate in the world. 
We are dealing here with adjustable 
rate mortgages, business loans and se-
curities, and even some student loans. 
For many years LIBOR was the index. 
When LIBOR went up, the interest rate 
on these instruments would go up. 
When LIBOR went down, the interest 
would go down. For many years it 
worked well. 
LIBOR is based on a survey of British 
bankers. A few years ago some British 
bankers lied and some went to jail. Our 
friends across the pond said they would 
stop publishing the LIBOR index. We 
asked them to keep doing it. They are 
going to stop on June 30, 2023. 
Some $16 trillion of loans and busi-
ness instruments will still be out-
standing. Those instruments will speci-
fy that you calculate the interest rate 
based on LIBOR, and LIBOR will not 
exist. 
These $16 trillion of loans and other 
business instruments do not specify 
what is supposed to happen if you go to 
calculate the interest rate based on 
LIBOR and there is no LIBOR. That is 
why they are called tough legacy 
LIBOR instruments. 
We could do what all too often hap-
pens in Washington—we could ignore 
the problem. We could then leave it up 
to tens of thousands of class action 
lawsuits, hundreds of thousands of reg-
ular lawsuits, as borrower and lender 
try to figure out what interest rate 
would apply. That would be terrible for 
our economy and our court system. 
We have got a better idea. The legis-
lation before us today, H.R. 4616, the 
Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, 
which will provide borrowers, inves-
tors, and all those in the financial 
space certainty as to what happens 
when LIBOR is no longer published. 
Before I continue, I want to thank 
Chairwoman 
WATERS
and 
Ranking 
Member MCHENRY, and their staff for 
working closely with me to get this bill 
on the floor today. I particularly want 
to thank Rob Robilliard of my staff 
who has poured his heart and soul into 
this bill for the entire year. 
I am pleased to say that H.R. 4616 has 
received the support of 21 business or-
ganizations, I would say every business 
organization with a stake in this mat-
ter, including the American Bankers 
Association, the Independent Bankers, 
and the Chamber of Commerce. 
I want to particularly thank Kristi 
Leo, President of the Structured Fi-
nance Association, for working with us 
on this bill. The legislation has also 
won the support of so many public in-
terest groups, including the National 
Consumer Law Center and Americans 
for Financial Reform. 
I particularly want to thank Andrew 
Pizor of the National Consumer Law 
Center for his assistance. 
Not only has this legislation received 
support from these important organiza-
tions, but every word—and I mean 
every word—has been carefully re-
viewed by the Federal Reserve Board, 
the U.S. Treasury Department, the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission, the 
Office of Controller of the Currency, 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency, 
and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau. We have revised it again and 
again based on their comments. 
Each of these agencies has cleared on 
every word of the bill before us today. 
Once again, I want to thank the staff, 
particularly of the Federal Reserve, for 
their excellent work for helping us 
draft this legislation: Mackenzie Gross, 
Evan Winerman, and Mark Van Der 
Weide. 
This text before us is a consensus 
product and all the agencies have 
signed off. We have worked with over 
100 different organizations and groups, 
and to my knowledge none oppose the 
text that is before us today. 
I want to thank the Alternative Ref-
erence Rate Committee, which was 
convened by the New York Fed which 
created the structured overnight fi-
nance rates, which are based on the 
treasury markets. Those markets are 
public, transparent, and not subject to 
manipulation. It is a broad market. 
Unlike the LIBOR rate, it is not sub-
ject to manipulation. 
This bill provides that as to that $16 
trillion of tough legacy LIBOR, pursu-
ant to regulations published by the 
Fed, the various SOFR rates that are 
applicable will stand in for the LIBOR 
rate once the LIBOR rate is no longer 
published. It sounds simple, but let me 
tell you it has been a hell of a year as 
you try to get consensus on a bill af-
fecting $16 trillion. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little 
bit about why this bill is necessary and 
why it is so important. Just 2 months 
ago, October 20, the Federal Reserve, 
the CFPB, the FDIC in conjunction 
with the State Bank and Credit Union 
Regulators issued a joint statement 
stating that failure to adequately pre-
pare for LIBOR’s discontinuance could 
undermine the financial stability and 
safety and soundness of the institu-
tions they oversee. 
The Financial Stability Oversight 
Council, which we created in response 
to the 2008 meltdown, said that a ces-
sation of LIBOR has the potential to 
significantly disrupt our financial mar-
kets. The SEC similarly warned that 
LIBOR’s discontinuance may pose a 
significant risk to our stock and bond 
markets. 
Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal 
Reserve Board Chair Powell told us 
that we need legislation to deal with 
this matter at the Federal level, and it 
is bipartisan. Steve Mnuchin testified 
to the same thing when he was Sec-
retary of the Treasury in the Trump 
administration. 
Finally, I should point out that Fed-
eral Reserve Chair Powell has told us 
that failure to deal with this presents a 
big financial stability risk to our en-
tire economy. 
As to the scope of this bill, it deals 
only with tough legacy LIBOR. It does 
not deal with those instruments that 
expire while LIBOR is still published, 
nor does it deal with those instruments 
that are created in the future and do 
not reference LIBOR. 
There was an earlier draft of this bill 
that set forth the obvious, and that is 
the substitution of SOFR for the 
LIBOR index does not constitute a sale 
or exchange for tax purposes. We took 
that out because we wanted to move 
the bill quickly and not cause a refer-
ral to the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mostly we took it out because it was 
absolutely unnecessary. 
It is very clear under existing tax 
law, the change of one index to another 
index that is incredibly similar, in this 
case, designed to be as close as hu-
manly possible does not constitute a 
sale or exchange, but especially where 
that change is through the operation of 
law and where the change is neces-
sitated because the original index is no 
longer published. The tax outcome is 
obvious and does not need to be part of 
the statute. 
The last change we made in this bill 
was to add the words ‘‘for purposes of 
the governing law of such LIBOR con-
tracts’’ to section 5(d). We did that to 
make it clear that we weren’t dealing 
with any tax issue and anybody could 
hold it up to a magnifying glass and 
try to find a tax word in it. By putting 
these words in it we satisfied the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. There is no 
taxation in this statute. 
This law does deal and preempts the 
field with regard to all non-tax law, 
that means contract, commercial, fi-
nancial law at both the Federal, State, 
and local level. 
Finally, this act does not prescribe 
what interest rates ought to be used in 
the future. That is up to the parties in-
volved. Nothing in this bill is designed 
to encourage the use of SOFR or any 
other particular benchmark interest 
rate, nor does it encourage or authorize 
any Federal regulatory agency to push 
any bank or other institution to use 
any particular rate in the future. That 
is up to them. 
This bill deals with $16 trillion of 
tough legacy LIBOR. It is a consensus 
product. It is the result of the work of 
regulators, industry, and the public in-
terest community. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
appreciate the opportunity to be here 
today and to have this conversation. 
This shouldn’t be a surprise. We 
knew this day was coming since 2014. 
The Alternative Reference Rate Com-
mittee, the ARRC, has worked dili-
gently to help ensure a successful tran-
sition from the aforementioned LIBOR 
rate system to a new system. 
In fact, over the last several years, 
Republicans on the Financial Services 
Committee have raised this issue on 
numerous occasions with our pruden-
tial regulators, as well as the Sec-
retary of the Treasury under even the 
last administration. 
I, myself, have asked for a greater 
focus on this issue, but unfortunately, 
this request seemingly fell on some 
deaf ears. It was unfortunate that my 
colleagues on the other side seemed to 
sort of forge ahead without having a 
broader conversation. There was one 
hearing on this issue before we marked 
up this bill in July. We needed to do a 
better job in socializing this particular 
issue because now, Mr. Speaker, we 
have a problem. 
We have Members of this Chamber 
who do not understand the issue and 
don’t understand the process, and they 
look at this as being just rushed. They 
don’t see the 21⁄2, 3, 4, 5 years of having 
this discussion since the London Whale 
scandal happened where there was a 
manipulation of those international in-
terest rates. 
Here we are today, once again, be-
cause of a truncated process, and it ap-
pears to some of our Members that we 
are rushing through a bill that is going 
to expand the Federal Government, 
that could cost the Federal Govern-
ment something, that is going to inter-
fere with private contracts. We simply 
have not done the work to normalize 
and socialize this particular issue. 
This has been described as a once-in- 
a-generation event, and we are talking 
about financial instruments with hun-
dreds of trillions of dollars at stake, in-
cluding effects that we can’t even to-
tally foresee. 
Fast-forward more than 21⁄2
years, 
here we are less than a month from the 
deadline, and we are just now voting on 
a bill to address these legacy contracts 
for the transition from LIBOR. 
b 1145 
This is Washington and, frankly, the 
process at its worst. 
So how did we get here? Every day, 
thousands of financial contracts attach 
LIBOR as the interest rate. With 
LIBOR phasing out, the financial sys-
tem needs legal certainty on what hap-
pens to those legacy contracts that 
have this rate already baked in. 
This bill attempts to provide a solu-
tion. It offers an alternative rate to af-
fected parties who cannot agree on a 
rate to replace LIBOR. 
To be clear, the rate offered under 
this legislation is one option. It does 
not prevent these parties from agreeing 
to something better that suits those 
particular needs of that contract. 
Again, this bill was passed out of 
committee in July. Now, 4 months 
later, the Committees on Ways and 
Means and Education and Labor were 
finally able to include their portions of 
this. That is 4 months of inaction that 
has caused some of that now, today, 
concern by many on this side of the 
aisle. 
To make this situation more frus-
trating, we still don’t know where the 
Senate stands. I don’t, the chair 
doesn’t, and certainly the industry 
doesn’t know where the Senate is. 
Frankly, maybe the Senate doesn’t 
know itself. But, hopefully, today will 
spur them into this conversation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7484 
December 8, 2021 
The bottom line is this process could 
have been much, much better. In fact, 
it should have been much, much better. 
It must be better when we are talking 
about preventing systemic risk to our 
financial system. 
Our regulators who supervise the fi-
nancial system have stated that this is 
a satisfactory fix, but I would wager a 
bitcoin that they aren’t happy with 
how we arrived here today. 
As a whole, I would like to thank the 
regulators for their hard work, and, in 
fact, I do believe that this bill would 
not be here today without their guid-
ance. But this is not the process that 
Financial Services Committee Repub-
licans would have pursued, and it is 
certainly not quite the bill that we 
would have drafted. But there are tril-
lions of dollars at stake, and the safety 
and soundness of our financial system 
is at the stake, and here we are with an 
eleventh hour scramble again. Unfortu-
nately, that seems to define how Wash-
ington, D.C., is being run today. 
I will not stand in the way of this 
process, of allowing this process, and 
the progress for our regulators to be 
able to supervise this financial system. 
But I do encourage my Republican col-
leagues to trust our regulators and sup-
port this legislation despite having 
some doubts about the process of what 
we are seeing here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to respond to 
this gentleman’s remarks about the 
process. First, this bill is a good bill. 
Vote for the bill. There is no doubt this 
bill is a good bill. 
I don’t need to talk about the proc-
ess, but I will for just a second. As to 
whether we had sufficient hearings and 
enough hearings that match the inter-
est of this House, we had a full hearing 
of my subcommittee on this, and it is 
not as if 400 Members of the House 
showed up and said: We are not a mem-
ber of the subcommittee, but can we 
participate? 
It is not as if the balcony is filled. It 
is not as if we deprived our colleagues 
of information they were anxious to 
obtain. 
But it is not just one hearing of the 
subcommittee. I regarded at least a 
dozen of the hearings of the Financial 
Services Committee over the last 2 
years as hearings on LIBOR. In my 
opening remarks, I quoted what Sec-
retary Mnuchin said. He said that in 
response to my questions when he 
came before us at hearings. The gen-
tleman knows that at least probably a 
dozen hearings that we have had at Fi-
nancial Services where we had the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, where we had 
the Chair of the Federal Reserve, where 
we had other experts, I asked a ques-
tion about LIBOR. And if my col-
leagues had found this subject near as 
interesting as I do, they would have 
asked questions about LIBOR as well. 
So we had one hearing dedicated to 
LIBOR and a dozen and more hearings 
where those dedicated to LIBOR could 
have asked questions. 
As to whether people in this House 
should think that we are interfering 
with the rights of businesses to trans-
act business, I include in the RECORD a 
letter in support of this bill signed by 
21 business groups basically, every 
business group that deals with any in-
strument tied to the LIBOR index. 
DECEMBER 7, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SPEAKER
PELOSI
AND
REPUBLICAN 
LEADER MCCARTHY: We, the undersigned or-
ganizations, support H.R. 4616, the ‘‘Adjust-
able Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act,’’ to address 
‘‘tough legacy’’ contracts that currently ref-
erence LIBOR. We respectfully request the 
House of Representatives expeditiously pass 
this legislation. 
In June 2023, all tenors of US dollar 
LIBOR, one of the most important financial 
benchmarks that underpins nearly $200 tril-
lion in financial contracts, will cease to be 
published. As a result, there are trillions of 
dollars of hard to modify financial contracts, 
securities, and loans that use LIBOR—known 
as ‘‘tough legacy’’ contracts—that are un-
able, before this end date, to either convert 
to a non-LIBOR rate or amend the contracts 
to add adequate fallback language to another 
rate. Without federal legislation to address 
these contracts, investors, consumers, and 
issuers of securities may face years of uncer-
tainty, litigation, and a change in value. 
This would thereby create ambiguity that 
would lead to a reduction in liquidity and an 
increase in volatility. 
H.R. 4616 provides a solution for these 
‘‘tough legacy’’ contracts that have insuffi-
cient fallback language and cannot other-
wise be amended among the parties. The leg-
islation is narrowly crafted to allow parties 
to contracts that already have effective fall-
back provisions to opt-out of the legislation 
and to only apply to tough legacy contracts 
so that new or future business will not be af-
fected. In addition, the legislation offers uni-
form, equitable treatment for all U.S. con-
tracts that fall under the federal legislation. 
It creates a safe harbor from litigation for 
parties that are covered by the legislation 
and prevents otherwise inevitable litigation 
costs and gridlock. The need for uniform fed-
eral legislation has been expressed by con-
sumer groups, investors, financial regu-
lators, and industry participants. 
We thank the House Committee on Finan-
cial Services for providing a bipartisan solu-
tion that offers fair, equitable and consistent 
treatment for all ‘‘tough legacy’’ contracts 
in support of the LIBOR transition by pass-
ing H.R. 4616 out of the committee by voice 
vote. We wholeheartedly support the Adjust-
able Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act and ask that 
you and all Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives vote in favor of this critical leg-
islation.

urers; Education Finance Council; The Loan

Mr. SHERMAN. Finally, as to the 
issue, I agree with the gentleman that 
I would like to have had this bill come 
up 21⁄2 years before LIBOR ceased to be 
published. We are bringing this to this 
House 11⁄2 years before LIBOR ceases to 
be published. Compared to everything 
else in Washington, that is record time. 
I speak today on a fiscal year that 
began October 1 where we hope to pass 
the appropriations bills in February. 
Dealing with a problem 11⁄2 years before 
it happens may not be 21⁄2 years in ad-
vance, but it is good compared to ev-
erything else I have seen. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I will 
reserve my comments for our colloquy, 
but the gentleman certainly knows 
that communication has been slim at 
best between staff and Members. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL), who is a leader on 
this issue. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
distinguished ranking member of the 
House Financial Services Committee 
for yielding and, of course, the chair-
man of the Subcommittee on Investor 
Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Cap-
ital Markets, Mr. SHERMAN, for his 
leadership. On this side of the aisle, 
there is absolutely no debate that Mr. 
SHERMAN has the most passion on this 
topic as a certified public accountant 
and that his questions about improving 
this bill are unlimited. 
I rise today in support of this effort, 
flawed as it might be, and support the 
Adjustable Interest Rate Act of 2021. 
As the chairman of the subcommittee 
said, for decades, the London interbank 
market has been the institutional fixed 
income rate used by hundreds of mar-
ket participants to benefit American 
families because that LIBOR rate has 
been a very competitive rate and facili-
tated securities being issued that fa-
cilitated in more houses being built for 
more families in America, a liquid 
market for our families’ credit card 
debt, and important student loan debt. 
So this rate is critically important, 
and it is a part of, also, the U.S. dollar, 
Mr. Speaker, being at the forefront of 
the global securities market. 
As the ranking member on our Hous-
ing, Community Development, and In-
surance Subcommittee, it was the go- 
to rate for mortgage-backed securities 
and for use of the government sec-
ondary mortgage market for Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac. I think the 
chairman has outlined the importance 
of this. 
This bill deals with all those con-
tracts that depended on that LIBOR

rate that just stubbornly don’t have an 
alternative right now. As we approach 
the end of the quote for this important 
interest rate, there are contracts—the 
chair says some $16 trillion of bonds 
outstanding—that need this replace-
ment contractual rate. 
This bill does not increase govern-
ment. This bill does not increase regu-
latory power. This bill facilitates the 
private-sector bond market solving 
this tough, thorny issue for the stub-
born minority of bond market trans-
actions that we call these legacy 
issues. 
Now, the gentleman from Michigan, 
the gentleman from California, and I 
have listened to and worked on this bill 
for years, and we thought the Federal 
Reserve and the regulators were going 
to solve this problem years ago. That is 
what they told us years ago. 
But as those years have gone by, they 
found that they can’t solve this prob-
lem in the regulatory agencies, and 
they have turned to Congress to legis-
late and craft a narrow fix to solve 
these tough contracts. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I am in 
favor of taking this action today. I en-
courage my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle—this is a technical issue, and 
it is an eyes-glazed-over issue, but it 
affects all the families in our country. 
It affects the importance of the U.S. 
dollar in capital markets. When LIBOR 
concludes in June 2023, we don’t want 
any gap, Mr. Speaker, in the ability to 
have those legacy contracts move for-
ward. 
I don’t believe this is a bill that any-
one should oppose. I think we all 
should support it. It has the support of 
the six regulatory agencies; it has the 
support of the financial industry; and 
it deals with reality. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend from Michigan for yielding me 
the time. I thank him for his work. 
Yes, this process was flawed, first in 
the hands of the regulators, and, sec-
ondly, I think it could have been far 
better in the majority, particularly as 
it relates to getting the views of the 
Ways and Means Committee and the 
Education and Labor Committee. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
simply say to my Republican col-
leagues who may be watching: You 
don’t have to trust the 21 business 
groups who have signed the letter that 
I just included in the RECORD, and you 
don’t have to trust me. Listen to the 
words you just heard from our col-
league, Mr. HILL: This bill does not in-
crease 
government 
or 
regulatory 
power. You ought to vote for the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the 
gentleman at this point to engage in a 
colloquy if he is so willing. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
be thrilled. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. I know this is an 
issue that is both thrilling and excit-
ing, but let me just state that the prob-
lem I am hearing from some of my col-
leagues is they don’t necessarily under-
stand the depth, breadth, and work 
that has gone into this for years prior 
to this. They know that it is showing 
up. They are questioning whether there 
was a hearing; they are questioning 
whether there was a proper markup; 
and sadly, they are questioning that 
because it seems to be following a pat-
tern as of late. That is why there are 
questions. 
Mr. HILL, others from the committee, 
and I are trying to alleviate that. A 
number of our colleagues have ex-
pressed they haven’t had time to really 
dive into it and come to us with those 
types of questions. So we are trying to 
deal with that. 
But as far as our colloquy here, we 
both described in our respective re-
marks that it is regulators who ulti-
mately worked on that. 
Mr. Chairman, is that correct? 
Mr. SHERMAN. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. HUIZENGA. I yield to the gen-
tleman from California. 
Mr. SHERMAN. This bill reflects an 
awful lot of work by the regulators, 
particularly the Fed. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Yes, and the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, OCC, 
FHA, CFPB, and, of course, the Fed. I 
appreciate the technical advice that 
each of them has lent and, ultimately, 
their comments. They actually re-
viewed every change that was made to 
this bill as sufficient to address the 
issue. 
It is fair to say that it is a fix that 
these regulators have requested. Is 
that fair? 
Mr. SHERMAN. Absolutely. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Let’s turn to the 
Senate here. 
It is my understanding, however, 
that there is no consensus in the Sen-
ate and that it is unlikely, frankly, 
that any action in the Senate will spe-
cifically, exactly reflect this bill. 
Would that be a characterization 
that you have as well? 
Mr. SHERMAN. I have long advo-
cated for a unicameral legislature. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. I think we can let 
that reflect as a yes. 
The Senate will probably be acting. 
We know that they will be acting, as 
has been expressed by the players on 
the Senate. 
Mr. SHERMAN. If I can comment on 
that further? 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Please. 
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senate has ad-
dressed this issue, and they have dis-
cussed the bill. Most of the com-
mentary has been positive. There was a 
recent hearing. 
In particular, I believe that Mr. 
TOOMEY had a concern that somehow 
this bill would influence future instru-
ments and that somehow regulators 
would be pushing banks, particularly 
smaller banks, to use SOFR in the in-
struments they draft in the future. 
That is why the report that accom-
panies this bill makes it excruciatingly 
clear that nothing in this bill author-
izes, directs, encourages, or allows a 
regulator to point to this bill and say: 
Now, bank, you need to use SOFR in 
the instruments used in the future. 
Nothing in this bill authorizes a reg-
ulator to push or give a preference to 
any other regulation. The report lan-
guage 
was 
drafted 
with 
Senator 
TOOMEY in mind. 
b 1200 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, re-
claiming my time on that; that would 
be my understanding of that. And a 
concern that I had of not having ‘‘coer-
cion’’ is the word that I would use, that 
private entities could be coerced into 
using a particular declared rate. 
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. 
I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I will simply comment again, for the 
record. This bill deals with tough leg-
acy LIBOR instruments drafted in the 
past, and nothing in it—and you can 
look at every word of all 22 pages— 
nothing in it would allow anyone to 
say you have got to use SOFR, or you 
ought to use SOFR, or we give you a 
preference to use SOFR, or any other 
benchmark in any instrument you 
draft in the future. And just in case 
that wasn’t excruciatingly clear, we 
put it in the report as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the 
right to close. I have no other speak-
ers, so I will reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. And I 
will just make a few final points on 
this bill. 
There are trillions of dollars that are 
caught up in this, and this is about the 
safety and soundness of our financial 
system. Whether it is mortgages, car 
loans, you name it, this is an inter-
national stage where this is being 
played out on. 
And as I have said, we could do better 
than an eleventh-hour scramble; should 
have done better than an eleventh-hour 
scramble, but here we are. 
Again, this is not the process that I 
would have chosen or my colleagues on 
the Republican side would have pur-
sued. It is not the bill necessarily that 
we would have drafted. But I will not 
stand in the way of allowing our regu-
lators to supervise the financial system 
within checks, within proper checks. 
This is not giving them free rein. I do 
expect that there will be changes to 
occur from the Senate. I look forward 
to hearing and listening to the regu-
lators on those changes. 
I do encourage my Republican col-
leagues to listen to our regulators, but, 
more so, listen to your Republican col-
leagues who have been working on this 
issue. And I ask that they support this 
legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7486 
December 8, 2021 
And, no, we will not see an increase 
in government. No, we will not see an 
increase in the regulatory footprint. It 
clarifies how we are going to be dealing 
with and how these private companies 
are going to need to move forward with 
the legacy contracts that they have 
that no longer are within the param-
eters that are allowed because of this 
fraud that had happened within the 
LIBOR system. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
am prepared to close. 
As to the process, we have had a 
dozen hearings with the top financial 
officials in the U.S. Government over a 
period of 2 or 3 years at the full com-
mittee, in which it was appropriate 
and, in my case, I used this oppor-
tunity to bring up the LIBOR issue. 
They have testified again and again 
that we need Federal legislation. 
Then the six regulatory agencies in-
volved each have reviewed this down to 
the comma, and we have had discus-
sions, down to the comma. They have 
helped us draft legislation. 
My hope is that we not only pass this 
legislation today, but that my Repub-
lican colleagues help me pass this bill 
through the Senate in the current 
form. You want a form that reflects 
the regulators? Every comma reflects 
what the regulators would like to see. 
It is important that this bill not be 
held up in the Senate by those who 
want to change existing law and say, 
well, not only should this act not allow 
a regulator to push a bank toward this 
or that index, but if any other law 
gives the regulators the power to do 
that, we should strip that authority 
from them. That is not the purpose of 
this bill. 
If somebody wants a bill titled, regu-
lators shouldn’t be pushed to telling 
banks what to do on indexes, I will 
work with the gentleman, if he wants 
to, on a freedom to pick your own 
index bill. This is a bill to just deal 
with LIBOR. 
So my hope is that we will have Re-
publican House Members who urge the 
Senate to move quickly because, yes, it 
would have been better to deal with 
this issue 21⁄2 years in advance. We have 
dealt with it 11⁄2 years in advance; a 
full hearing, a full markup, a full op-
portunity for anyone to submit amend-
ments at that full markup, and a dozen 
hearings, at which it was appropriate 
to address questions—at least I did—of 
the top officials in our country dealing 
with financial matters about the im-
portance of LIBOR. 
This bill is important because it 
deals with $16 trillion of instruments 
where we will not be able to calculate 
how much the borrower must pay the 
lender after June 30 of 2023 unless we 
pass this bill. 
This is a consensus product. The con-
sumer and public interest groups, the 
business groups, the regulators, and we 
are passing it and need to pass it expe-
ditiously so that we deal with this 
issue long before it disrupts our finan-
cial markets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE). The question is on the motion of-
fered by the gentleman from California 
(Mr. SHERMAN) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4616, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

LIVESTOCK MANDATORY 
REPORTING EXTENSION 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 5290) to extend 
authorization for livestock mandatory 
reporting. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5290 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. LIVESTOCK MANDATORY REPORTING 
EXTENSION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 260 of the Agri-
cultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 
1636i) is amended by striking ‘‘2020’’ and in-
serting ‘‘2022’’. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 942 
of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 
1999 (7 U.S.C. 1635 note; Public Law 106–78) is 
amended by striking ‘‘2020’’ and inserting 
‘‘2022’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on the 
bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 5290. 
Our agriculture industry is the best, 
the greatest in the world. And at the 
centerpiece of it is our livestock indus-
try. And that is why we are gathered 
here. 
Livestock mandatory reporting is an 
important tool that provides the nec-
essary transparency information to our 
livestock producers. This legislation 
extends livestock mandatory reporting 
until the end of September 2022, and it 
has bipartisan support with Democrats 
and Republicans working together on 
this very, very important bill. 
In talking to our great livestock pro-
ducers, I have heard time and again 
how important it is to extend this 
mandatory 
reporting 
program; 
and 
that if we let it lapse it will cause sig-
nificant problems for our farmers and 
ranchers. 
We are working together to make 
sure we get the job done the right way. 
All of our industry groups agree on this 
important bill, and that is the 1-year 
extension immediately of our livestock 
reporting. 
Our Agriculture Committee held a 
hearing earlier this year that exten-
sively covered the importance of live-
stock reporting, mandatory reporting. 
In that hearing, we also heard from a 
variety of very distinguished industry 
representatives that, first and fore-
most, we need to extend this program. 
My committee’s work on this issue— 
and while I am at it, I want to really 
give great thanks and gratitude to our 
agriculture staff. They have worked 
very diligently on this, and we are 
grateful for the hard work and dedica-
tion of the House Agriculture Com-
mittee staff. 
So, as I said, my work on this issue is 
indicative of how important the live-
stock industry is to our fellow com-
mittee members, both Democrats and 
Republicans, and to our Nation and the 
vital importance, as the leading force, 
in our Nation’s economy. That is where 
our great agriculture system is today. 
I am aware of some ongoing discus-
sions and pending legislation that 
seeks to reform the cattle industry, 
and we are going to deal with that. We 
are dealing with that over in the Sen-
ate Agriculture Committee and in our 
House committee. 
However, we should not let negotia-
tions of those reforms that we are 
working with stand in the way of ex-
tending this vital program for 1 year. 
In recent months, we have seen cattle 
markets begin to recover; prices for 
producers have moved up. This change 
in market dynamics is important to ac-
count for as we look to reach a con-
sensus point on the framework of our 
reforms. 
This 1-year extension will help to set-
tle the concerns in the livestock mar-
kets and provide certainty to our live-
stock industry, while also giving our 
Agriculture members in both the House 
and the Senate more time to come up 
with a consensus of the proposed re-
forms to cattle markets. 
We, in our House committee, are 
working with the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. I am personally working 
with Senator GRASSLEY on the Senate 
committee so that we can have legisla-
tion going forward that has the vital 
input of both the House and the Sen-
ate, and we are giving it the time and

the interest that is needed, more time 
to have a consensus on the reforms 
that other Members of Congress have 
ideas on. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1215 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5290, to extend authority for the 
Department of Agriculture’s Livestock 
Mandatory Reporting program. 
Under the Livestock Mandatory Re-
porting program, or LMR, meatpackers 
across the country are required to re-
port to the USDA the details of trans-
actions involving the purchase of cat-
tle, swine, and sheep, as well as trans-
actions for the corresponding sales of 
certain beef, pork, and lamb products. 
The USDA compiles and disseminates 
the information through hundreds of 
market reports each week, detailing 
price trends and supply and demand 
conditions. In turn, livestock industry 
participants, including farmers, ranch-
ers, and feedlot operators, use the in-
formation to make informed mar-
keting decisions. 
The livestock markets have experi-
enced significant price volatility lead-
ing up to and in the wake of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, cattle markets in 
particular. As I am sure many of you 
have heard from constituents at home, 
this uncertainty has led to cries from 
the countryside for significant market 
reforms and investigations into packer 
purchasing behavior. 
As industry and Congress continue to 
grapple with the best approach to im-
proving market transparency while 
avoiding unintended consequences, and 
as we await the results of ongoing in-
vestigations, it is imperative that 
farmers and ranchers maintain access 
to the market information already pro-
vided by LMR. 
H.R. 5290 would do just that, pro-
viding much-needed certainty for the 
year ahead. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this important legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume for the purpose of 
closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the Livestock Manda-
tory Reporting program is really a nec-
essary and significant tool for the agri-
culture industry, especially based on 
the disruptions that we experienced 
most recently in 2020. 
I think American citizens are con-
sciously aware of the difficulties and 
the potential difficulties with the food 
and agriculture supply chains and the 
difficulties that they experienced as 
they went to the grocery stores as they 
sought to feed their families, specifi-
cally during 2020 and in the wake of 
COVID–19. The Livestock Mandatory 
Reporting program is a tool that can 
help avoid that type of an issue. 
This reauthorization, as the chair-
man said, is important. It gives us time 
to have a great debate and to look at 
how we increase transparency within 
the livestock industry. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
extension, this reauthorization, to give 
us time to make the necessary fixes 
and refinements in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I will just close right 
briefly with a big thank you to my 
great staff, which is headed by the dis-
tinguished, smart, and dedicated Anne 
Simmons. I don’t know what I would 
do without her. Of course, Ashley 
Smith, Prescott Martin, Daniel Fein-
gold, 
Lesly 
McNitt, 
Kelcy 
Schaunaman, and also my chief of 
staff, Catherine Kuerbitz. We are a 
team, and I want to thank our staff. 
Also, I want to thank our ranking 
member. We work together in a bipar-
tisan way. This is an example of how 
we Democrats and Republicans have 
got to continue to do. We are here 
today setting this fine example of 
strong bipartisanship. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr.

CATTLE CONTRACT LIBRARY ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 5609) to amend 
the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, 
to establish a cattle contract library, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT) and the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the bill under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5609. 
One of my goals, Mr. Speaker, as 
chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, is to ensure that our farm-
ers and our ranchers are treated fairly. 
This bill, which creates a cattle con-
tract library, will improve fairness 
through increasing transparency in the 
marketplaces. 
Mr. Speaker, over the past few years, 
we have seen significant volatility in 
our cattle markets, and the Agri-
culture Committee has held hearings 
to discuss this volatility and the 
events that precipitated those price 
fluctuations. 
As we look for ways to bring about 
parity to cattle markets, this bill is 
one good step in that right direction. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend, Mr. JOHNSON, for his work on 
this bill. This is a good reminder, an-
other reminder, of the great bipartisan 
legislation that is possible when we 
Democrats and Republicans work to-
gether to address important issues. I 
thank the gentleman, Mr. JOHNSON, for 
putting this bill forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield the management 
of this bill to Mr. JOHNSON of South 
Dakota. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 5609, the Cattle Contract Library 
Act of 2021. 
As I am sure many of my colleagues 
have heard from their constituents 
back home, the differences between 
prices paid to producers for their live 
cattle, and those paid by consumers at 
the meat counter, have led to spirited 
debate about the transparency of the 
cattle markets in the wake of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
A variety of hearings on the matter 
have amplified those concerns. These 
hearings and other related oversight 
have also made very clear the differing 
opinions on if and how they should be 
addressed legislatively. 
There is a small, but vocal, faction in 
support of government mandates dic-
tating thresholds of cattle to be pur-
chased on the spot market. Frankly, 
such a proposal lacks broad industry 
support and, in my opinion, needs fur-
ther review to ensure it would actually 
achieve its intended goals. 
In fact, on two occasions now during 
this Congress, the House Agriculture 
Committee has heard from diverse 
groups of respected economists and in-
dustry stakeholders about the poten-
tial costs and unintended consequences 
of this sort of government intervention 
in the marketplace. 
Giving these complex and compelling 
interests, I am thankful for Congress-
man DUSTY
JOHNSON’s leadership in 
pursuit of what I view as a pragmatic 
middle ground with a broad cross-sec-
tion of industry support. 
If true market transparency is the 
goal, it seems to make sense that a 
cattle contract library could serve as 
part of the solution. The library would 
serve as a clearinghouse of information 
regarding the various contract provi-
sions being utilized in a variety of mar-
keting arrangements. Hopefully, access 
to this information would provide pro-
ducers and feeders more insight into 
market transactions and ultimately 
give them more leverage in negotiating 
better terms for the sale of their cat-
tle. 
It may not be a silver bullet to all 
that ails the industry, but I certainly 
think H.R. 5609 marks a commonsense 
step in the right direction. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
join me in support of this carefully 
crafted bill. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s be honest. It has 
been a pretty difficult few years to be 
a cattle producer. People in that busi-
ness understand the cyclical nature of 
prices, so that is not so much their 
beef, if you will. 
But in that environment, it is much 
more difficult to have black swan 
event after black swan event hit these 
hardworking men and women. From

December 8, 2021 
the Holcomb fire to COVID–19 disrup-
tions, it has been an incredibly volatile 
marketplace. They are trying to make 
a living and they are trying to pay 
their bills in that kind of environment 
with less price transparency than they 
have ever had. 
Now, it used to be relatively easy. Of 
course, I think we all know that price 
discovery is a critically important part 
of any fully functional marketplace. It 
used to be easy. You just went down to 
the sale barn, you sat in the seats, and 
you were able to see exactly what Mr. 
MANN was selling his cattle for and ex-
actly what Mrs. HARTZLER was buying 
them for. 
But as we have seen a migration of 
sales away from the sale barn and to 
alternative 
marketing 
agreements, 
that has left our producers less pre-
pared to understand what is going on in 
the marketplace. 
That is why I was so grateful to see 
a broad cross-section of stakeholders 
come together in Phoenix a few months 
ago. They said: Gosh darn it, we are 
tired of having the livestock industry 
fight amongst each other. Let’s settle 
on what we can agree on, things that 
we can actually get done in the 117th 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, they came out of that 
meeting with a clear clarion call for 
what Congress can do to help. There 
were three majors items, but the cattle 
library, along with the bill we just 
passed, the Livestock Mandatory Re-
porting program, were the heart of one 
of the three recommendations. 
What this bill does is takes the infor-
mation, basic nonconfidential informa-
tion, from those alternative marketing 
agreements and makes it available, 
and it makes sure that there is a mech-
anism for that information to be put 
into resources that can actually be 
used by the independent cattle pro-
ducers and the small feeders that are 
so critically important to this market-
place. 
This has been widely bipartisan, and 
this is embraced by a fantastic cross- 
section, from the U.S. cattlemen to 
NCBA to Farm Bureau to National 
Farmers Union to the Livestock Mar-
keting Association, good people who 
have come together and understand 
that while this does not solve the prob-
lem, it is a critically important step in 
moving us in the right direction. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 5609, a 
bill that I am a cosponsor of, the Cattle 
Contract Library Act. 
This legislation includes a vital piece 
of my Optimizing the Cattle Market 
Act that establishes a USDA-main-
tained library of cattle contracts, in-
cluding information on the type of con-
tract, length of the contract, pricing 
information, and delivery information. 
The increased market transparency 
that this bill provides is long overdue. 
American cattle producers continue 
to face challenges as a result of market 
disruptions and the unprecedented ef-
fects of the COVID–19 pandemic. It is 
essential that cattle producers are 
equipped with the necessary resources 
and knowledge to increase their lever-
age during price negotiations for cat-
tle. 
The Cattle Contract Library Act can 
provide a much-needed tool in helping 
cattle producers make informed deci-
sions and survive volatility across to-
day’s industry. 
I fully support this bipartisan legisla-
tion, and I thank Congressman DUSTY 
JOHNSON for his hard work and leader-
ship on this. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no additional speakers 
on this bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to recognize the real 
leadership that Mrs. HARTZLER
has 
shown on these issues for years and 
thank her for that. 
One of the great things about Con-
gress is most of us were just normal 
people before we got here, leaders in 
our industry, and the next speaker is 
certainly that. He is somebody who un-
derstands the finance of ag operations 
and the operation of these farms and 
ranches. He is one of the strongest 
freshman voices in Congress. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. 
JOHNSON) for all of his work in getting 
this legislation put together and bring-
ing it to the floor this morning. It is 
not a silver bullet, but it potentially 
can help our cattle markets. 
I grew up on a family farm and pre-
conditioning feed yard. I spent thou-
sands of hours riding pens and doc-
toring sick cattle in the Big First Dis-
trict of Kansas, which is the largest 
beef-producing district in the country. 
The Big First is home to cow-calf oper-
ations, feed yards, and packing plants 
of all sizes. 
In my district and across the coun-
try, cattle producers face challenging 
market dynamics, including histori-
cally wide gaps between wholesale beef 
prices and fed cattle prices, packing ca-
pacity and regulation, and more. 
I have talked to hundreds of cattle 
producers in Kansas, ranging from 
small cow-calf operations to some of 
the country’s largest feed yards. Over-
whelmingly, I have heard that we need 
to increase price discovery in the cash 
market, make sure that producers ben-
efit when they provide a superior prod-
uct, refuse to let the government in the 
free market, and acknowledge regional 
differences in the industry. 
The Cattle Contract Library Act is a 
simple step toward addressing some of 
today’s concerns with more fairness, 
transparency, and healthy competition 
in the cattle market. I am committed 
to working with the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON), my col-
leagues in the House, and others across 
Kansas and the country in addressing 
any concerns with the program and the 
cattle market before reauthorization of 
the program at this time next year. 
The Cattle Contract Library Act will 
help ensure that all market partici-
pants are both paying and receiving a 
fair price for their goods. It sends a 
clear message to ranchers, farmers, and 
livestock producers across the country 
that their voices are being heard in 
Washington. I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), 
a Member who has firsthand experience 
with the true operation of America’s 
farms and ranches. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 5609, 
the Cattle Contract Library Act of 
2021. 
My fellow farmers, farm families, and 
members of the House Agriculture 
Committee know the importance of 
bringing transparency to the cattle 
market. Currently, cattlemen are un-
aware of contract terms being offered 
by producers, which leads to a decline 
in leverage for smaller producers dur-
ing price negotiations. 
This bill will require packers to re-
port terms of alternative marketing 
agreements between packers and pro-
ducers to the USDA, equipping ranch-
ers with additional market data needed 
to make informed business decisions. 
The USDA library will provide pro-
ducers with key details on cattle con-
tracts, including the type and dura-
tion. Market transparency is a critical 
component of price discovery in cattle 
marketing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 
putting forth this important legisla-
tion. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my friend and colleague from 
South Dakota for yielding me time to 
speak today. 
Iowa’s farmers, ranchers, and pro-
ducers know the value of a hard day’s 
work. For years, they have endured 
challenges beyond their control. Even 
though I am a doctor, I know of no 
work more demanding than birthing 
calves in the middle of winter and help-
ing them to survive. 
Natural 
disasters 
such 
as 
fires, 
drought, and derechos have created sig-
nificant market disruptions. 
I was proud to be a cosponsor of Con-
gressman JOHNSON’s Cattle Contract 
Library Act to give cattlemen access

to the most accurate data to make the 
best decisions possible for their fami-
lies and their business in the face of 
these conditions and provide more 
transparency in the markets. 
For months, I have been calling for 
increased transparency in our cattle 
markets to help both producers and 
consumers. I was proud to introduce 
the bipartisan Meat Packing Special 
Investigator Act to take on anti-
competitive practices and give pro-
ducers a fair shake and strictly enforce 
the Packers and Stockyards Act. 
I was also proud to help introduce 
the Cattle Price Discovery and Trans-
parency Act, which aims to return fair-
ness to the cattle marketplace domi-
nated by four major meatpackers. 
It is crucial for Iowa’s producers that 
there is fairness and transparency in 
our cattle industry. I thank Congress-
men JOHNSON and CUELLAR for their in-
credible work on this issue. I urge all 
of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
important legislation, H.R. 5609. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know that I can 
say it any better than the Members of 
Congress here who have so much first-
hand experience with working ranches 
and farms. This is a beautiful bipar-
tisan solution. 
If you believe in the marketplace, 
then you understand the importance of 
price discovery, and you cannot have 
price discovery if you don’t have trans-
parency. This just provides additional 
leverage and additional tools to the 
hardworking, independent cow-calf op-
erators and small feeders who have 
seen their position, their leverage, in 
the marketplace erode in recent years. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to enthusiastically support 
this promarket legislation. I look for-
ward to the Senate expeditiously tak-
ing up this issue as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
First of all, I thank the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 
his dedication, hard work, and talent 
in putting forward this bill. 
I believe that our ranchers, farmers, 
and those in the agriculture industry 
are looking at a great day for agri-
culture today to get these four impor-
tant bills over to the Senate, where we 
will be working together on them. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. 
JOHNSON, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 5609. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

NATIONAL FOREST RESTORATION 
AND REMEDIATION ACT 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4489) to amend 
the Act of June 20, 1958, to require that 
certain 
amounts 
collected 
by 
the 
United States with respect to lands 
under the administration of the Forest 
Service be invested into interest bear-
ing obligations, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4489 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Forest Restoration and Remediation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. INVESTMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDS INTO 
INTEREST BEARING OBLIGATIONS. 
Section 7 of the Act of June 20, 1958 (16 
U.S.C. 579c), is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘of any improvement, pro-
tection, or rehabilitation’’ and inserting ‘‘of 
any assessment, improvement, protection, 
restoration, or rehabilitation’’; and 
(2) by striking ‘‘Provided, That’’ and all 
that follows through the period at the end 
and inserting: ‘‘Provided, That any monies 
covered into the Treasury under this section, 
including all monies that were previously 
collected by the United States in a for-
feiture, judgment, compromise, or settle-
ment, shall be invested by the Secretary of 
the Treasury in interest bearing obligations 
of the United States to the extent the 
amounts are not, in the judgment of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, required to meet cur-
rent withdrawals: Provided further, That any 
interest earned on the amounts, including 
any interest earned by investment, is hereby 
appropriated and made available until ex-
pended to cover the costs to the United 
States specified in this section: Provided fur-
ther, That, for fiscal year 2021 and thereafter, 
the Secretary shall include in the budget 
materials submitted to Congress in support 
of the President’s annual budget request 
(submitted to Congress pursuant to section 
1105 of title 31, United States Code) for each 
fiscal year the proposed use of such amounts 
with respect to the Forest Service: Provided 
further, That any portion of the monies re-
ceived or earned under this section in excess 
of the amount expended in performing the 
work necessitated by the action which led to 
their receipt may be used to cover the other 
work specified in this section.’’.

the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT) and the gen-
tleman from South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the bill under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume, and I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4489. 
This bill is an excellent example, 
again, of the strong bipartisan work 
that can be accomplished through the 
Agriculture Committee. First, I want 
to applaud and thank the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) and the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA) for working together to get 
this legislation to the floor for consid-
eration today by the full House. 
Mr. Speaker, we know that there are 
significant needs for investment in res-
toration and recovery work on our 
great national forests. Our bill this 
morning allows the Forest Service to 
keep interest on settlement funds and 
apply these additional resources to res-
toration work on Forest Service land 
that has been damaged by mining ac-
tivities and wildfires. All of us know of 
the devastation that these wildfires 
have caused to our forests. 
This is one of several major responses 
that we here in Congress are respond-
ing to, to keep our forestry strong and 
to provide this much-needed financial 
help to keep interest on settlement 
funds and apply those additional re-
sources to the restoration work and 
the Forest Service lands that were 
damaged by these terrible fires. 
It will also allow for more restora-
tion work to be done in some of the 
areas where it is most needed, particu-
larly the West Coast in California. It 
will allow this restoration work, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port this commonsense, bipartisan leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA), the lead Repub-
lican on H.R. 4489. 
b 1245 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
our chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, Mr. SCOTT, and I have appre-
ciated working with Ms. SCHRIER from 
Washington and helping her lead this 
bill and letting me help do so. I am 
glad to be able to support this bill here 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7491 
December 8, 2021 
Of course, this bill is just common 
sense. It will allow the Forest Service 
to use the interests they gather on set-
tlement accounts to continue the im-
portant restoration work we have in 
our forests, especially after so many 
horrific fires. 
Currently, the U.S. Forest Service 
must transfer the interest they collect 
to the General Treasury accounts. 
Now, this feels a little bit like if my 
kids are out gathering aluminum cans 
and plastic bottles and I keep the 
money when we take it down to be re-
cycled. 
The Federal Government should be 
allowing the money generated by these 
settlement accounts to build up and go 
for the much-needed work instead of 
skimming that money off the top. 
Now, other agencies like the Depart-
ment of the Interior are allowed to re-
tain the interest that accrues on their 
accounts and allows them to spend 
that additional money on needed res-
toration in their projects. 
The 2021 fire season, as we know— 
which is getting to be every year—was 
devastating for the West and left mil-
lions of acres that will need to be re-
stored, including one in my district 
known as the Dixie fire, which was 
right at a million acres. A million 
acres, one fire. 
Without this legislation amending 
the Forest Service’s ability to retain 
this interest, the value of the settle-
ment accounts diminishes over time. 
There already isn’t enough money to 
replant and restore to get our forests 
growing again after devastating fires, 
so why are we skimming this interest 
off the top and thinking we are doing 
something by putting it back in the 
Treasury? Why wouldn’t we want the 
focus to be on restoring and replanting 
our forests after so many devastating 
fires year after year. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. SCHRIER for 
stepping forward and sponsoring this 
bill, and I look forward to hearing her 
comments on this. Somehow, I got 
ahead of her in order here. I also look 
forward to working with Ms. SCHRIER. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER), the sponsor of this bill. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank Mr. 
LAMALFA for his kind words and for co-
sponsoring this bill with me. 
My bill, the National Forest Restora-
tion and Remediation Act will help the 
Forest Service fund the cleanup of 
damaged public lands. 
This bipartisan legislation, which 
passed unanimously out of the Com-
mittee on Agriculture would allow the 
Forest Service to collect and keep in-
terest earned on settlement funds, 
much like other Federal agencies do, in 
order to supplement their already 
strained restoration efforts. 
The Forest Service is responsible for 
overseeing the remediation and res-
toration of lands damaged by mining 
activities and human-caused wildfires. 
And when the negligent actions of com-
panies or individuals result in damages 
to Forest Service property, officials 
enter a settlement agreement with the 
responsible parties to hold them ac-
countable. The Forest Service then 
uses the settlement funds to restore 
the affected lands. 
At the moment, the Forest Service 
does not have the authority to retain 
interest on those settlement funds like 
other Federal agencies, like the De-
partment of the Interior and the EPA 
do. The National Forest Restoration 
and Remediation Act would simply 
allow the Forest Service to retain in-
terest on settlement funds and apply 
those additional resources to restora-
tion work that is abundantly needed. 
Without this additional funding, the 
value of settlement funds diminishes 
over time, and the Forest Service can 
face long-term budget shortfalls for en-
vironmental cleanup. If this bill had 
been in effect between fiscal years 2015 
and 2019, the Forest Service would have 
received more than $7.5 million to sup-
plement their environmental restora-
tion work. 
So as we confront another poten-
tially devastating wildfire season, it is 
so important to ensure that the Forest 
Service can use accrued interest to pro-
tect and remediate our forests. 
The Forest Service provides many 
important environmental services in 
Washington 
State, 
including 
miti-
gating wildfires and improving forest 
health. This is especially critical in 
places like Chelan County in my dis-
trict where 82 percent of the land is 
owned by the Forest Service. 
According to the National Inter-
agency Fire Center, there were over 
50,000 human-caused wildfires last year 
burning nearly six million acres na-
tionwide. And over half of the wildfires 
on Forest Service lands are started by 
humans. 
My bill will ensure that when we hold 
bad actors accountable for negligent 
behavior, the Forest Service can fully 
use the fines and the interest to reha-
bilitate the land. 
I was so proud to introduce this bill 
with my colleagues Representatives 
LAMALFA, ROSENDALE, and NEGUSE. I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense bill to protect our Fed-
eral public lands. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Mon-
tana (Mr. ROSENDALE), another leader 
in this effort. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from South Da-
kota for yielding to me. I thank my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who helped bring this bill to the floor 
today. 
I am proud to rise in support of this 
bipartisan bill with Congresswoman 
SCHRIER, H.R. 4489, the National Forest 
Restoration 
and 
Remediation 
Act, 
which would allow the Forest Service 
to use accumulated interest on settle-
ment agreements to restore our na-
tional forestlands. 
Montana is blessed with an abun-
dance of public lands with well over 20 
million acres available to all for recre-
ation, hunting, fishing, camping, and 
more. It is part of who we are as Mon-
tanans and an important aspect of our 
Montana way of life. 
These public lands are a patchwork 
of land managed by the State as well as 
the National Park Service, Bureau of 
Land Management, and the U.S. Forest 
Service. If these Federal lands are 
damaged, an agency will reach a settle-
ment agreement with the responsible 
party to support restoration and clean-
up efforts. 
And while the Department of the In-
terior, which houses the National Park 
Service, and the BLM has the author-
ity to retain interest from these settle-
ment funds, the Forest Service does 
not. 
This commonsense bill would rectify 
that by allowing the Forest Service to 
use the interests on settlement funds 
to restore damaged public lands, which 
improves forest health and supports 
conservation. It merely will mirror the 
policy that is already utilized by these 
other agencies. 
When the Forest Service enters into 
a settlement agreement, the funds are 
deposited into the Treasury account 
that is used to remediate the damaged 
land. However, these accounts do not 
allow the Forest Service to take advan-
tage of the interest generated in them, 
leading to the value of funds available 
for forest restoration to diminish over 
time creating the potential for years- 
long delays and budget shortfalls from 
remediation efforts. 
The National Forest Restoration and 
Remediation Act would ensure the For-
est Service has adequate funding for 
restoration work by unlocking this ad-
ditional funding without additional ex-
penses to taxpayers. 
I, again, urge my colleagues to sup-
port Congresswoman SCHRIER and my 
bill and I thank all those involved in 
this commonsense, bipartisan legisla-
tion. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I think it has been said very well. Mr. 
ROSENDALE just reminded us that this 
only mirrors the authority that other 
agencies have to be able to gather up 
the interest from those interest-bear-
ing accounts. 
Ms. SCHRIER did a good job of remind-
ing us that had this been in place in re-
cent years, it would have been $7 mil-
lion more that could have been in-
vested in forest management and in 
forest health. And I just want to echo 
all of those findings. 
This is absolutely a commonsense, 
bipartisan bill, and I am looking for-
ward to its passage. 
But I can’t let the passage of this 
bill, which would be a big success, go 
by without calling attention to how 
much more needs to be done with re-
gard to forest health.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7492 
December 8, 2021 
I remain disappointed, as so many do, 
of the fact that this Congress, this ad-
ministration has not prioritized highly 
enough forest management. 
Mr. Speaker, here is what I know 
from the Black Hills of South Dakota: 
A managed forest is a healthy forest. 
And I want to say that one more time 
because there will be no truer state-
ment spoken on the House floor on this 
day: A managed forest is a healthy for-
est. 
Today, millions of acres in this coun-
try are at risk of severe wildfire with 
potentially catastrophic impacts to our 
communities. Six of the worst fire sea-
sons on record have occurred just over 
a period in the last few years. 
Our agencies, Federal partners, com-
munities, and our States need more 
tools to proactively manage and miti-
gate this threat. Again, a managed for-
est is a healthy forest. 
And so, yes, by all means, let’s cele-
brate this bill. It is an important tech-
nical fix that will improve in a narrow 
way the funding needs of the Forest 
Service. But let us keep in mind, to an 
even greater extent, in the days that 
follow that the resiliency of our forests 
remains a critically important na-
tional priority, and one that deserves 
greater attention from this body. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion, I encourage the Members to vote 
‘‘aye,’’ and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Again, I thank Mr. JOHNSON for the 
time he has put into this bill. The peo-
ple of this country are very grateful, 
and we hope they realize how we here 
in Congress are really responding to 
the challenges facing our forestry, par-
ticularly with these wildfires. 
A while back I recognized some of my 
staff, but we have had an addition that 
I would like to recognize because he 
really worked feverishly on this bill all 
the way up until this morning, I under-
stand, and that is Mr. Paul Babbitt. I 
would ask Paul to stand. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank him for his work. 
So much has already been said about 
this, but I am so proud of the efforts of 
our full House committee because once 
we really began to get into the ravages 
of these wildfires out West about a 
year back, we made a commitment 
that we were going to make sure that 
we did everything we can to save and 
prosper our great forestry industry, 
and we have done it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
great bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
DAVID SCOTT) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4489, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE RE-
SEARCH AND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 5608) to support 
research and state management efforts 
on chronic wasting disease. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5608 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chronic 
Wasting Disease Research and Management 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neu-
rological disease found in cervids, is a funda-
mental threat to the health and vibrancy of 
deer, elk, and moose populations, and the in-
creased occurrence of chronic wasting dis-
ease in regionally diverse locations neces-
sitates an escalation in research, surveil-
lance, monitoring, and management activi-
ties focused on containing and managing 
chronic wasting disease. 
(2) A focus on research into the trans-
mission of, resistance to, diagnosis of, and 
epidemiology of chronic wasting disease is 
needed to inform future policies to combat 
the disease and ensure the health of cervid 
populations. 
(3) Because States and Tribes have diverse 
policies for addressing chronic wasting dis-
ease, the Federal Government, in consulta-
tion with the Chronic Wasting Disease Task 
Force established by section 104 of America’s 
Conservation Enhancement Act (Public Law 
116–188), should coordinate financial and 
technical support to States and Tribes, State 
and Tribal departments of agriculture, State 
and Tribal wildlife agencies, institutions of 
higher education, and research centers con-
ducting scientific research on chronic wast-
ing disease. 
(4) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the 
States retain primacy and policymaking au-
thority with regard to wildlife management. 
(5) Under current policies, chronic wasting 
disease remains a systemic threat to cervids. 
(6) Scientific advances that lead to the 
ability to stop transmission of chronic wast-
ing disease are needed to ensure the long- 
term viability of cervids. 
SEC. 3. CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE RESEARCH 
AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. 
(a) RESEARCH PROGRAM.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date on which funds are made avail-
able to carry out this section, the Secretary 
of Agriculture shall establish a program

enter into cooperative agreements or other 
legal instruments, as authorized under 10413 
of the Animal Health Protection Act (7 
U.S.C. 8312), with eligible entities to conduct 
research on the transmission of, resistance 
to, and diagnosis of chronic wasting disease. 
(2) CRITERIA
FOR
SELECTION.—In entering 
into cooperative agreements or other legal 
instruments pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
Secretary shall give priority to eligible enti-
ties that shall conduct research relating to— 
(A)(i) methods and products to effectively 
detect infectious chronic wasting disease 
prions in live cervids, cervid excreta, the en-
vironment, and inorganic surfaces, and to de-
contaminate such infectious prions; or 
(ii) testing methods that significantly im-
prove sensitivity and accelerate timelines 
for test results on non-live cervids; 
(B) the long-term suppression or eradi-
cation of chronic wasting disease; or 
(C) determination markers for genetic re-
sistance to chronic wasting disease and 
strategies for using genetic resistance to 
combat the spread of the disease; 
(D) sustainable cervid harvest manage-
ment practices to reduce chronic wasting 
disease occurrence and to prevent or limit 
spatial spread of chronic wasting disease; or 
(E) factors contributing to local emergence 
of chronic wasting disease, increased preva-
lence of chronic wasting disease, and dis-
tribution of chronic wasting disease, includ-
ing mechanisms of disease transmission and 
effective barriers to transmission. 
(3) SIZE OF AWARDS.—To the maximum ex-
tent 
practicable, 
individual 
cooperative 
agreements or other legal instruments en-
tered into under paragraph (1) shall be not 
less than two percent and not more than 10

(E) the greatest need for response to new 
outbreaks of chronic wasting disease occur-
ring in— 
(i) areas in which chronic wasting disease 
is already found; or 
(ii) areas with first infections, with the in-
tent of containing chronic wasting disease in 
any new area of infection. 
(4) RAPID RESPONSE.—If a State or Indian 
tribe detects chronic wasting disease in a 
cervid population within its jurisdiction that 
was not previously infected, the Secretary 
may, notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), 
immediately issue funds made available 
under subsection (e), in an amount to be de-
termined by the Secretary, to support State 
and Tribal efforts to immediately control 
the spread of chronic wasting disease within 
that population. 
(5) PUBLIC EDUCATION ON CHRONIC WASTING 
DISEASE.—The Secretary, in consultation 
with State and Tribal departments of agri-
culture and wildlife agencies, organizations 
representing the farmed cervid industry, and 
organizations 
representing 
deer 
hunters, 
shall develop and maintain materials based 
on the latest scientific knowledge to be used 
to educate the public on chronic wasting dis-
ease and techniques to help prevent the 
spread of the disease.

striking ‘‘(25 U.S.C. 450b)’’ and inserting ‘‘(25 
U.S.C. 5304)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT) and the gen-
tleman from South Dakota (Mr. JOHN-
SON) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
b 1300 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5608. Chronic 
wasting disease is a devastating illness 
and has had significant impacts on deer 
and other cervid populations around 
our great Nation. And improving man-
agement of chronic wasting disease is 
vital to containing the disease and pre-
venting further spread of the disease. 
Currently, there is no cure for the 
disease, and passage of this bill will 
also provide important research fund-
ing so that scientists can better under-
stand the disease and their trans-
mission. 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me a real spe-
cial honor to recognize and say a word 
about the great sponsor of this bill— 
two great sponsors, I might add—Mr. 
RON KIND, and Ranking Member G.T. 
THOMPSON, for their longtime dedica-
tion on this important issue. Both of 
these gentlemen have been working on 
this bill feverishly for quite some time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is also special be-
cause of Mr. RON KIND, one of our stal-
wart leaders and tremendous contribu-
tors to the Congress and this Nation, 
and most certainly to his great State 
of Wisconsin. But we all have heard the 
news that our good friend, Mr. KIND, 
this will be his last year here with us, 
and he has dedicated so much of his 
time to this specific bill. He is a good 
man and a good friend, and he is also a 
good friend of my own brother-in-law, 
Hank Aaron. And he, in Wisconsin, who 
represents Eau Claire, played a very 
big role in getting that statue up there 
for my brother-in-law, Hank Aaron. He 
sent me a message when the Braves 
won the World Series. He said: DAVID, 
Hank is up in heaven smiling now. 
I say to my friend: We are going to 
miss you. Great work here. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope the body will for-
give me a digression before we talk 
about chronic wasting disease, which 
is, as the chairman says, critically im-
portant. I do also want to talk about 
Mr. KIND. 
So many Americans believe that 
every Member of Congress is a kind of 
villain with scales and fangs and horns, 
and that they are all just despicable 
people, or at the very least somebody 
who belongs to the opposite tribe is a 
despicable person. I just don’t know 
anybody in Congress who believes that 
is true of RON KIND. 
I will recount a story about a dinner 
where I had my two oldest boys with 
me. One of them was seated next to Mr. 
KIND. My son stole Mr. KIND’s dessert, 
and rather than erupt in anger or an 
accusatory finger wag, he handled it 
with great grace and friendship. My 
boys remind me still of that evening 
spent with Mr. KIND. 
Mr. Speaker, as he seeks, certainly, a 
less stressful and perhaps a better and 
more rewarding future, let us remark 
on the type of impact that a decent 
person can still have in these Halls, 
and this bill before us today is ample 
evidence of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND), who 
is the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, as the origi-
nal sponsor of H.R. 5608, the Chronic 
Wasting Disease Research and Manage-
ment Act, I rise in strong support of 
this legislation, which did pass unani-
mously out of the Agriculture Com-
mittee. I do thank and commend my 
good friend and colleague from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for being one 
of the original sponsors of this legisla-
tion with me; of course, my dear friend, 
the chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, Mr. SCOTT, for his support and 
leadership. 
Throughout the years, I have been in-
volved in a lot of debates and discus-
sions on the House floor. I don’t think 
I have ever been brought to blushing, 
and I thank the chairman for his kind 
introductory remarks and, of course, I 
thank my dear friend from South Da-
kota (Mr. JOHNSON) for those remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, but to the task at hand, 
this legislation does authorize $70 mil-
lion for research and management of

CWD, 
or 
chronic 
wasting 
disease, 
through USDA grants. Chronic wasting 
disease is a contagious neurological 
disease affecting cervid animals—deer, 
elk, moose—and it is 100 percent fatal. 
And it is caused by misfolded proteins, 
or prions, as they are known, that rav-
ages the animal’s brain. 
The legislation also authorizes USDA 
and State and Tribal agencies to de-
velop educational materials to inform 
the public on CWD and directs USDA 
to review its certification program 
within 18 months. 
CWD has been reported in over 25 
States and is spreading. It not only is 
devastating to these animals and their 
herds but also to the outdoor recre-
ation economy; namely, hunting, that 
depends on these animals. 
Fortunately, the CDC has not found 
any jump from these animals to hu-
mans, and that is one of the reasons 
why we need further research to ensure 
that that does not happen. CWD pre-
sents one of the greatest threats to 
deer and other wild cervids in the 
United States and it has no known 
cure. 
We have been battling this disease in 
Wisconsin for many years out of con-
cern for the wildlife population and the 
adverse economic impact that it has, 
which is substantial. Hunters in Wis-
consin have about $2.5 billion yearly 
economic impact, supports directly or 
indirectly over 35,000 jobs, and gen-
erates billions in salaries and wages. 
Last year, 131 out-of-State hunters 
came into the State of Wisconsin just 
to participate in the 9-day deer gun 
hunt season, which always takes place 
during the week of Thanksgiving. They 
spent about $3.4 million. Nationwide, 
according to the International Associa-
tion of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 
hunting in America is big business, 
generating more than $67 billion in eco-
nomic output and over 1 million jobs. 
Now, we can stand here and throw 
more facts and figures about the eco-
nomic toll the CWD is having, but as a 
kid who grew up loving to hunt in Wis-
consin with my dad and my brothers— 
deer hunting, turkey hunting, duck 
hunting on the Mississippi, now we do 
most of our deer and turkey hunting on 
the family farm, a little bit north of La 
Crosse. It is much more than just eco-
nomics and jobs and the amount being 
spent by hunters and the amount of 
revenue that we raise through the Rob-
inson-Patman Act, which is collected 
and then reinvested in vital conserva-
tion programs throughout the country. 
It is part of our DNA, our heritage, our 
culture. 
One of the most alluring aspects of 
the 9-day deer gun hunt season isn’t 
the actual hunt itself, it is deer camp. 
It is being able to spend some time 
with your family, brothers, families, 
cousin, play some poker, razz each 
other for the weekend. And then that 
next morning, opening morning, you 
have over 800,000 hunters flooding the 
fields and forests of Wisconsin. Some-
times it feels like the third day of the 
Battle of Gettysburg, the number of 
shots going off. I perhaps overstate 
that, but it is a real communal activity 
that brings people together and still 
one of the bonding elements, I think, 
that transcends the politics and the 
tribal nature of politics today. So it is 
important in that regard as well. 
We have tried some self-help meas-
ures in Wisconsin to try to battle the 
spread of CWD, from free, clear firing 
zones, increase prohibition on baiting 
and feeding deer, to an earn a buck pro-
gram, where you have to shoot a doe 
first before you can shoot a buck. All 
these are wildly unpopular with hunt-
ers because they are meant to try to 
reduce the deer herds and prevent the 
congregation and the spread of the dis-
ease from animal to animal. 
That is why, again, I think this re-
search is important. And there has 
been some good research taking place 
on prion disease generally in CWD, 
places like UW-Wisconsin and Wash-
ington and other areas. This legislation 
will enable that type of open-source re-
search and collaboration to take place 
with increased vigor and focus, which 
again is long overdue before it spreads 
even further into more States ad-
versely affecting the wildlife herds and 
the economy of those States. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is nec-
essary to expand the basic and applied 
research that we see taking place that 
can be further enhanced, and also to 
better detect the spread of this disease, 
find out better management and con-
tainment strategies, and ultimately 
lead to a cure of the disease. 
I do thank the Congressional Sports-
men’s Foundation, Jeff Crane, and his 
team over there, for his support and 
help with this legislation. They have 
been terrific to work with, as a former 
chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s 
Caucus here in Congress. 
I thank Theodore Roosevelt Con-
servation Partnership, the National 
Wildlife 
Federation, 
the 
Boone 
& 
Crockett National Deer Association, 
North American Deer Farmers Associa-
tion, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, 
Mule Deer Foundation, Wildlife Man-
agement Institute, Backcountry Hunt-
ers and Anglers—many people, many 
groups, many members that have a 
vested interest in making sure we do 
this research right. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the legislation 
is self-evident of the need. I encourage 
my colleagues to support it. And I con-
clude by thanking Olivia Kirchberg on 
my office staff who has been instru-
mental in helping us get the bipar-
tisan, unanimous support for this legis-
lation that it has enjoyed, and we look 
forward to working with the Senate for 
its passage there. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he would 
consume to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER), one of this 
body’s leading voices in policing, in 
mining, in infrastructure. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, Con-
gressman KIND talked about the deer 
camps and the stories. I remember the 
very first time at 16 years old when my 
father brought me up to the hunting 
shack with my uncles. It is a special 
time for those of us who recreate and 
deer hunt. I am proud to cosponsor this 
legislation with him, and I thank him 
and others for their work. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of legislation I proudly cosponsored, 
the Chronic Wasting Disease Research 
and Management Act. CWD threatens 
Minnesota’s legendary whitetail deer 
herd and, therefore, our hunting way of 
life up North. 
Whitetail season is an annual tradi-
tion for hundreds of thousands of Min-
nesotans. Every year, we meet at our 
respective deer camps, reconnecting 
with family and old friends. We retell 
stories from previous years, and maybe 
embellishing a little bit, as we pass on 
the traditions and culture to our chil-
dren. 
However, deer harvests were down 8 
percent throughout Minnesota this last 
year due to a myriad of issues. And if 
deer harvests keep trending down-
wards, it means fewer stories to share 
at camp around the fire, fewer deer for 
new hunters and kids to see and experi-
ence. Therefore, our hunting traditions 
trending down directly correlated with 
those harvest numbers. And in Min-
nesota, this trend will only be exas-
perated by further spread of CWD. 
In my district we have CWD hotspots 
cropping up seemingly every other 
week. Whether it be in Brainerd, the 
Bemidji area, or in other corners of the 
State, these troublesome reports are 
evidence of CWD creeping across our 
hunting lands. And that is why this 
legislation is so important right now. 
This CWD Research and Management 
Act authorizes needed funding for 
State agencies doing crucial on-the- 
ground work, like our DNR. 
Funding from this bill will help drive 
the research and testing needed to 
wrap our arms around the problem by 
letting the experts get in the field and 
the laboratory. It will also empower 
our State fish and game industries to 
partner with grassroots organizations 
that can reach and educate hunters 
across the State. 
The Minnesota Deer Hunters Associa-
tion has a statewide reach with a fin-
ger on the pulse of their membership. 
Helping the DNR help them is a true 
partnership that is necessary to com-
bat the spread of CWD. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge pas-
sage of this legislation in both the 
House and the Senate, and I look for-
ward to it becoming law. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.

Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thought Mr. KIND, Mr.

well. This is important because chronic

wasting disease can wreak such havoc 
upon our herds. 
I want to start by thanking Chair-
man SCOTT for facilitating the timely 
consideration of this bill, and not just 
this bill, sir, but also livestock manda-
tory reporting, the cattle contract li-
brary, and Ms. SCHRIER’s forestry bill. 
These came together, sir, and I want 
to thank you for that. I want to recog-
nize Mr. KIND, as well as Mr. THOMP-
SON, for the work that they put into 
this important bipartisan solution. 
I also want to express my apprecia-
tion for the coalition that Mr. KIND 
mentioned, such a broad coalition of 
stakeholders from the farmed and wild 
deer stakeholder groups and the sports-
men community at large. They pro-
vided a tremendous amount of insight 
so we could get this legislation right, 
and they were relentless in working 
with all of us to find common ground 
to craft this legislation and make sure 
that it was able to pass out of com-
mittee unanimously, and, hopefully, we 
can get a similar vote off the House 
floor. 
As it has been said, but as it bears re-
peating, chronic wasting disease is a 
contagious, neurological disease that 
affects deer and elk and moose. It is al-
ways fatal. Unfortunately, it is not a 
highly localized disease particular to a 
particular State or region of the coun-
try. CWD has been detected in 27 
States. Given the lack of any known 
cure, I fear that that number of States 
will only continue to grow. 
H.R. 5608 authorizes up $70 million of 
much-needed appropriations each year 
with the funding split evenly between 
CWD research and management efforts, 
all of this with the hope of one day 
eradicating this disease altogether. 
The funding would support high-pri-
ority research to improve CWD detec-
tion methods and to continue invalu-
able research on genetic resistance. It 
would support the use of the latest and 
most effective on-the-ground manage-
ment tools and strategies at the State 
and Tribal levels. 
The bill would also help improve pub-
lic awareness of the disease by requir-
ing the development and dispersal of 
educational materials which would be 
based, obviously, on the latest avail-
able science. 
Mr. Speaker, I know combatting this 
devastating disease would be a slow 
and challenging process, but I think we 
should all acknowledge that passage of 
this bill would be a critically impor-
tant step in that journey and can help 
us protect those vulnerable deer popu-
lations. 
I appreciate my colleagues’ attention 
to this matter, and I urge the entire 
House in casting a resounding ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the bill. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a very 
proud day and a proud moment for us 
here in the House of Representatives. 
This bill is going to help our agri-
culture industry, our deer, and a lot of 
our other animals. 
This chronic wasting disease has 
been so devastating. RON KIND has been 
working on this for several years. He 
has not just jumped on this, he has 
dedicated a lot of his time to this, and 
it is a great monument to him as he 
leaves his service here in the Congress. 
Job well done, my friend. Job well 
done. 
Mr. Speaker, we have no more speak-
ers. As we are concluding our four bills 
today, I am so proud of the great work 
that our House Agriculture Committee 
has done. We have them all moving 
over to the Senate, and so our work, 
again, begins anew as it goes over. 
We have good friends over there 
working. As I mentioned before, we are 
working with my colleague, Ms. STABE-
NOW from Michigan, who is chairman of 
the Senate Agriculture Committee; and 
as I mentioned before, my friend, Sen-
ator GRASSLEY. We are all going to 
come together and improve these four 
bills even more so. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
JOHNSON. I want to thank KIM SCHRIER. 
I want to thank our entire committee. 
This has been a great day, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
DAVID SCOTT) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5608. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR 
PREVENTION ACT 
MR. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1155) ensuring that goods made 
with forced labor in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region of the 
People’s Republic of China do not enter 
the United States market, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1155 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region of China, the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China has, since 2017, arbi-
trarily detained as many as 1.8 million 
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of 
other Muslim minority groups in a system of 
extrajudicial mass internment camps, in ad-
dition to arbitrarily detaining many in for-
mal prisons and detention centers, and has 
subjected detainees to forced labor, torture, 
political indoctrination, and other severe 
human rights abuses. 
(2) Forced labor exists within the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region’s system of 
mass internment camps, and throughout the 
region, and is confirmed by the testimony of 
former camp detainees, satellite imagery, of-
ficial media reports, publicly available docu-
ments, 
official 
statements, 
and 
official 
leaked documents from the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China as part of a 
targeted campaign of repression of Muslim 
ethnic minorities. 
(3) In addition to reports from researchers 
and civil society groups documenting evi-
dence that many factories and other sup-
pliers in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region are exploiting forced labor, the De-
partment of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry 
and Security on July 22, 2020, added eleven 
entities to the entity list after determining 
the entities had been ‘‘implicated in human 
rights violations and abuses in the imple-
mentation of China’s campaign of repression, 
mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and 
high-technology 
surveillance 
against 
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of 
Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region’’. 
(4) Audits and efforts to vet products and 
supply chains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Auton-
omous Region are unreliable due to the ex-
tent forced labor has been integrated into 
the regional economy, the mixing of involun-
tary labor with voluntary labor, the inabil-
ity of witnesses to speak freely about work-
ing conditions given government surveil-
lance and coercion, and the incentive of gov-
ernment officials to conceal government- 
sponsored forced labor. 
(5) The Department of State’s June 2020 
Trafficking in Persons Report found that 
‘‘Authorities offer subsidies incentivizing 
Chinese companies to open factories in close 
proximity to the internment camps, and to 
receive transferred detainees at satellite 
manufacturing sites in other provinces. 
Local governments receive additional funds 
for each inmate forced to work in these sites 
at a fraction of minimum wage or without 
any compensation.’’. 
(6) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has 
issued 11 ‘‘Withhold Release Orders’’ on prod-
ucts suspected to be produced with prison or 
forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region. Products subject to the ‘‘With-
hold Release Orders’’ include all cotton, cot-
ton products, tomatoes, and tomato products 
as well as certain garments, hair products, 
apparel, computer parts, and other products. 
(7) In its 2019 Annual Report, the Congres-
sional-Executive 
Commission 
on 
China 
(CECC) found that products reportedly pro-
duced with forced labor by current and 
former mass internment camp detainees in-
cluded textiles, electronics, food products, 
shoes, tea, and handicrafts. 
(8) Reports in 2020 indicated that, in recent 
years, People’s Republic of China Govern-
ment authorities had organized a labor 
training and transfer system on a mass 
scale. Under this system, hundreds of thou-
sands of rural residents of the Tibet Autono-
mous Region participated in ‘‘military- 
style’’ training, ideological education, and 
vocational training before being transferred 
to job postings in the Tibetan Autonomous 
Region or elsewhere in China. The similarity 
of the Tibet Autonomous Region system to 
that in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region raised fears that coercive practices 
or rights abuses may be taking place in the 
Tibet Autonomous Region.

H7496 
December 8, 2021 
(9) Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1307) states that it is illegal to import 
into the United States ‘‘goods, wares, arti-
cles, and merchandise mined, produced, or 
manufactured wholly or in part’’ by forced 
labor. Such merchandise is subject to exclu-
sion or seizure and may lead to criminal in-
vestigation of the importer. 
(10) The policies of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China are in contraven-
tion of international human rights instru-
ments signed by that government, includ-
ing— 
(A) the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, which the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China has signed but not 
yet ratified; 
(B) the International Covenant on Eco-
nomic, Social, and Cultural Rights, ratified 
by the People’s Republic of China in 2001; 
and 
(C) the United Nations Protocol to Pre-
vent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children 
(Palermo Protocol), to which the People’s 
Republic of China has been a state party 
since February 2010. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to prohibit the import of all goods, 
wares, articles, or merchandise mined, pro-
duced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, 
by forced labor from the People’s Republic of 
China and particularly any such goods, 
wares, articles, or merchandise produced in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of 
China; 
(2) to encourage the international commu-
nity to reduce the import of any goods made 
with forced labor from the People’s Republic 
of China, particularly those goods mined, 
manufactured, or produced in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(3) to coordinate with Mexico and Canada 
to effectively implement Article 23.6 of the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to 
prohibit the importation of goods produced 
in whole or in part by forced or compulsory 
labor, which includes goods produced in 
whole or in part by forced or compulsory 
labor in the People’s Republic of China; 
(4) to actively work to prevent, publicly 
denounce, and end human trafficking as a 
horrific assault on human dignity and to re-
store the lives of those affected by human 
trafficking, a modern form of slavery; 
(5) to regard the prevention of atrocities as 
in its national interest, including efforts to 
prevent torture, enforced disappearances, se-
vere deprivation of liberty, including mass 
internment, arbitrary detention, and wide-
spread and systematic use of forced labor, 
and persecution targeting any identifiable 
ethnic or religious group; and 
(6) to address gross violations of human 
rights in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region through bilateral diplomatic chan-
nels and multilateral institutions where 
both the United States and the People’s Re-
public of China are members and with all the 
authorities available to the United States 
Government, including visa and financial 
sanctions, export restrictions, and import 
controls.

H7499 
December 8, 2021 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1155. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1155, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act introduced by my good 
friend, colleague, and chairman of the 
Rules Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN. 
Let me also thank Speaker PELOSI 
for bringing this crucial measure to the 
floor, and her unwavering dedication to 
human rights issues in China over the 
course of her public life. 
This necessary and bold measure re-
inforces this body’s commitment to our 
values by responding to the PRC’s 
human rights violations and imposing 
concrete costs on the PRC for the use 
of Uyghur forced labor. 
Since 2017, the People’s Republic of 
China has systematically carried out 
mass detention, torture, political in-
doctrination, restrictions on religious 
attractions, and inhumane atrocities 
against Uyghurs and members of other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang. 
We have seen the People’s Republic 
of China expand its extensive program 
of repression and transform it into a 
system of state-sponsored forced labor. 
Under the guise of vocational training 
or poverty alleviation, authorities in 
Xinjiang have forced thousands of 
adults and children to work against 
their will and under threat of punish-
ment to produce goods and raw mate-
rials that are then woven into inter-
national supply chains and into our 
homes. 
According to the United States Holo-
caust Memorial Museum, it has been 
conservatively estimated that more 
than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred 
out of Xinjiang to work in factories 
across China between the years of 2017 
and 2019, with some of them being sent 
directly from detention centers. Some 
analysts estimate that over 100,000 ex- 
detainees in Xinjiang are working in 
conditions of forced labor today. 
I have seen firsthand the benefits of 
the American companies engaging in 
China. Most American companies pay 
above-market wages and have better 
corporate social responsibility prac-
tices than their domestic counterparts. 
It would be inconsistent with core and 
crucial American values for this body 
not to take a stand against forced 
labor, and to stand up for the per-
secuted Uyghurs. 
Many brave companies have already 
spoken out and made ethical choices 
detrimental to their bottom line, and 
this bill ensures that corporate actors 
that have lived their values are not at 
a competitive disadvantage in the 
American marketplace. 
This bill, which has passed the House 
before, prohibits the import of goods 
and merchandise from Xinjiang unless 
the importer can prove the products 
did not come from forced labor, im-
poses sanctions on officials facilitating 
the use of forced labor against Chinese 
ethnic minorities, adds important fi-
nancial disclosures for public compa-
nies that do business in the region, and 
calls for a diplomatic strategy to ad-
dress forced labor in Xinjiang. 
This is a straightforward bill. It sig-
nals that forced labor has no place on 
this planet. It signals that products 
made using forced labor in Xinjiang 
have no place in the American market-
place. In 2021, for any country to uti-
lize forced labor systematically and to 
oppress and exploit a population is sim-
ply unconscionable. 
With the passage of this bipartisan 
measure, the House would hold ac-
countable those responsible for perpe-
trating these heinous crimes that have 
irrevocably threatened the lives of over 
1.8 million Uyghurs and Muslim mi-
norities in Xinjiang and ensure Ameri-
cans and American companies are not 
complicit in the Chinese Communist 
Party’s human rights atrocities. 
This legislation is critical to showing 
that we are putting human rights at 
the center of our foreign policy and 
economic policy. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port and urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking Chairman MEEKS and Chair-
man MCGOVERN for bringing this im-
portant human rights legislation to 
this floor. It is high time. 
I want to start this debate with the 
simple truth that we cannot afford to 
forget. Truly, free trade cannot involve 
slave labor. 
Today, the Chinese Communist Party 
is using the forced labor of the Uyghurs 
and other minorities to help bankroll 
its genocide against these very same 
groups. 
b 1330 
The repression taking place right 
now in Xinjiang is breathtaking in its 
scope and its brutality. It involves the 
detention of more than 1 million people 
in concentration camps. It also in-
volves 
surveillance 
and 
intensive 
brainwashing on a massive scale. It in-
volves breaking up families and taking 
children from their parents. And it in-
volves forced sterilization and forced 
abortions. 
This should be a terrifying warning 
not only to China’s neighbors and to 
the American people but also to the 
world. The Chinese Communist Party 
is fundamentally focused on expanding 
its power and its authoritarian style of 
government. It views things that it 
does not control, like religion, cultural 
identity, and the yearning of all people 
for freedom, as threats that must be 
destroyed. Because we have drawn the 
CCP into many of our most critical 
supply chains, it has the ability to hold 
our national security hostage while it 
uses U.S. consumers to subsidize its 
atrocities. 
As many as one in five cotton gar-
ments globally are potentially tainted 
with Uyghur slave labor. Last year 
alone, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion seized a 13-ton shipment of human 
hair 
that 
originated 
in 
Xinjiang’s 
forced labor system. It is brazen, and it 
is sickening. 
We must refuse to be complicit in the 
CCP’s genocide against the Uyghurs, 
and for that reason, I support the 
measure before us today. 
I wish we could have taken this up 
earlier. After sending a letter to the 
Speaker, we are finally at the day 
where we are now. Last Congress, this 
legislation went straight to the floor. 
Two weeks ago, 10 members of the For-
eign Affairs Committee joined me in a 
letter urging the Speaker to move this 
bill. I am grateful that our message 
was received. But we could send this 
legislation to the President’s desk 
today by taking up the Senate version. 
Instead, we are setting this bill up for 
further legislative gridlock by passing 
a conflicting version, although I do ap-
plaud Chairman MCGOVERN’s efforts in 
this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, going forward, I hope 
the majority in both Chambers will 
move this to final passage regardless of 
pressure from the administration to 
not advance the American values we 
all share. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from the 
great State of Massachusetts (Mr. 
MCGOVERN), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank Chairman MEEKS for yielding 
me the time and for his incredible lead-
ership on this issue. I also want to 
thank 
Ranking 
Minority 
Member 
MCCAUL for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, many products used 
every day by people all over our coun-
try, 
including 
clothing, 
food, 
and 
shoes, are made using forced labor, the 
forced labor of Uyghurs and other Mus-
lim minorities held by the Chinese 
Government across a network of in-
ternment camps. 
It has been illegal to import forced 
labor products into the United States 
for more than 90 years, but it is exceed-
ingly difficult to spot them since Chi-
nese producers often mix together 
products that are the result of both in-
voluntary and voluntary labor. More-
over, the lack of Chinese Government 
transparency and the police state at-
mosphere in Xinjiang make auditing of 
product sourcing unreliable if not im-
possible, according to the administra-
tion’s ‘‘Xinjiang Supply Chain Business 
Advisory.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the imperative to act is 
clear. This is not a partisan issue. It is 
a human rights issue. It is a moral 
issue. 
There is already strong, diverse, bi-
partisan, and bicameral support for

this legislation on both sides of the 
Capitol. That includes my colleagues 
on the Congressional-Executive Com-
mission 
on 
China, 
Representative 
CHRIS SMITH and Senator MARCO RUBIO, 
the author of the Senate bill. 
I, too, want to especially thank 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI for her longtime 
advocacy for human rights in China 
and for her leadership in getting this 
bill to the House floor today. I want to 
thank Chairman RICHARD NEAL, Chair-
man GREGORY MEEKS, and Chairwoman 
MAXINE WATERS for their support in 
their committees. 
The House of Representatives passed 
this bill in September 2020 by a vote of 
406–3, but, sadly, the Senate did noth-
ing. It never took it up. The Senate 
now passed a version of this bill in 
July. It is time for us to get this done. 
Two years ago, the Congressional-Ex-
ecutive Commission on China, of which 
I serve as the co-chair, held a hearing 
and an expert roundtable and issued a 
groundbreaking staff report. This legis-
lation would not be possible without 
the hardworking staff of that Commis-
sion. 
Our findings of systematic and wide-
spread forced labor in Xinjiang are 
based on testimony from camp detain-
ees, satellite imagery of factories being 
built at internment camps, and public 
and leaked Chinese Government docu-
ments. 
Forced labor was one of the justifica-
tions cited by the State Department, 
first by Secretary Pompeo and then re-
iterated by Secretary Blinken, in de-
termining that the Chinese Govern-
ment was committing genocide against 
Uyghurs and members of other Muslim 
ethnic minority groups. 
Forced labor was listed by the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
its November 2021 report finding that 
the Chinese Government had com-
mitted crimes against humanity in 
Xinjiang. 
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act prohibits imports from Xinjiang to 
the U.S. by creating a rebuttable pre-
sumption that all goods produced in 
the region are made with forced labor 
unless U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection certifies by clear and con-
vincing evidence that goods were not 
produced with forced labor. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2 months, the Chi-
nese Government will host the Winter 
Olympics in the middle of a genocide. 
This is unconscionable. We asked the 
International Olympic Committee to 
postpone and move the games. They re-
fused. Instead, the IOC made ANTA, a 
Chinese company implicated in slave 
labor, its official sportswear uniform 
supplier. 
I am pleased that the Biden adminis-
tration has decided not to send Amer-
ican diplomats to the Olympics, but 
Congress needs to do its part by pass-
ing this bill before the Olympics start. 
We must take a clear moral position to 
stand with those who are suffering 
from forced labor and not with the Chi-
nese Government, the IOC, and the big 
corporations who profit off the exploi-
tation of slave labor. Shame on them. 
No more business as usual. 
We must pass and put into law the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
this. If the United States of America 
stands for anything, we need to stand 
out loud and four-square for human 
rights. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the ranking mem-
ber 
of 
the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Sub-
committee on Africa, Global Health, 
and Global Human Rights. He also is 
the co-chair of the China Commission 
and has been a champion for human 
rights in China for three decades. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
yielding. I thank Mr. MCCAUL for his 
extraordinary leadership on China, in-
cluding his Commission that has made 
many, many recommendations. I want 
to thank Chairman MEEKS for his lead-
ership as well and, of course, Chairman 
MCGOVERN, with whom I have worked 
on this bill, for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I chaired a Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission hearing in 
May titled ‘‘China, Genocide and the 
Olympics,’’ which helped further under-
score why H.R. 1155, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act, which I have co-
sponsored with JIM MCGOVERN, is so 
important and so necessary. 
At that hearing, we heard testimony 
from Rayhan Asat, whose brother, 
Ekpar, a Muslim Uyghur, at last report 
is still incarcerated in a concentration 
camp in Xinjiang. Ekpar is a tech en-
trepreneur, media founder, and philan-
thropist who won recognition both in-
side of China and outside. Indeed, our 
State Department thought so highly of 
him that he was part of the Inter-
national Visitors Leadership Program. 
But upon his return, because he was 
a Muslim Uyghur, the Chinese authori-
ties arrested him and disappeared him 
into a concentration camp where he 
has remained for 51⁄2 years. 
What happens, Mr. Speaker, to those 
swallowed up in these horrific con-
centration camps? 
That is something we heard about in 
another Lantos Commission hearing 
this past July where Gulzira, a sur-
vivor, told us what goes on each and 
every day. In addition to her horrific, 
firsthand description of unspeakable 
physical abuse, organized forced pros-
titution, rape, and every gross viola-
tion of human rights imaginable, she 
also gave a firsthand account of a 
forced labor factory in which she made 
gloves for export for 11⁄2 years. Gulzira 
is one of the lucky ones because she 
was released when Radio Free Asia 
broadcast her plight to the world. 
Mr. Speaker, there are millions of 
stories like hers waiting to be told, 
truly nightmarish accounts of Presi-
dent Xi Jinping’s genocide. And make 
no 
mistake 
about 
it, 
this 
is 
Xi 
Jinping’s genocide. He is personally re-
sponsible for having ordered it. 
The rape and sexual abuse of women 
being held in so-called internment 
camps, forced abortion, and involun-
tary sterilization to prevent the birth 
of Uyghur children are in direct viola-
tion of Article II(d) of the U.N. Geno-
cide Convention, which states in part 
that genocide includes imposing meas-
ures intended to prevent births within 
a group. 
Forced labor on a massive scale that 
allows Chinese companies to profit— 
and profit big time—from modern-day 
slavery is also absolutely pervasive in 
Xinjiang. Documents obtained by The 
New York Times and the International 
Consortium of Investigative Journal-
ists exposed just how cruel these plans 
are, originating, again, with Xi Jinping 
himself who early next year will be 
hosting the Olympic Games, which is 
outrageous. 
The leaked documents show how Xi 
directed the crackdowns, saying that 
the Communist Party must put the 
‘‘organs of dictatorship’’ to work and 
show ‘‘absolutely no mercy’’ in dealing 
with Uyghurs and other predominantly 
Muslim minorities. 
In one speech, President Xi said: 
‘‘The weapons of the people’s demo-
cratic dictatorship must be wielded 
without any hesitation or wavering.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned 
by a report from Josh Rogin in The 
Washington Post just last week stating 
how the Biden administration and Dep-
uty Secretary of State Wendy Sherman 
sought 
to 
undermine 
the 
Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, which 
passed the Senate last July and the 
House last Congress 406–3. According to 
Josh Rogin: ‘‘Biden administration of-
ficials have been quietly telling law-
makers to slow down. . . . Sherman 
made it clear that the administration 
prefers a more targeted and delibera-
tive approach to determining which 
goods are the products of forced labor.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
Josh Rogin’s column from The Wash-
ington Post, ‘‘Opinion: Congress needs 
to act on Xi Jinping’s genocide now.’’ 
[From the Global Opinions, Dec. 2, 2021] 
OPINION: CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT ON XI 
JINPING’S GENOCIDE NOW 
(By Josh Rogin, Columnist) 
This week, a private U.K.-based investiga-
tive panel released what it says are classified 
Chinese government documents that appear 
to show how Chinese President Xi Jinping 
personally laid the groundwork for system-
atic forced assimilation of ethnic minorities 
in Xinjiang. It’s the most damning proof to 
date of the ongoing Uyghur genocide. So why 
can’t Congress pass a simple bill to stop the 
products connected to that genocide from 
ending up in U.S. homes and businesses? 
Yet the documents, which likely come 
from the same tranche of leaked Chinese 
Communist Party communications revealed 
by the New York Times over two years ago, 
add to the already abundant evidence that 
the Chinese government’s mass internment, 
mass forced labor, forced population control, 
family destruction and cultural erasure of 
the Uyghurs fit the United Nation’s defini-
tion of genocide as ‘‘a crime committed with 
the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, ra-
cial or religious group, in whole or in part.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7501 
December 8, 2021 
Yet, the Democrat-led Congress can’t seem 
to get the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act, which passed the Senate unanimously 
in July, to President Biden’s desk. Pointing 
to procedural issues and promises of future 
action, Democratic leadership in both the 
House and Senate can’t seem to agree on a 
strategy to pass the bill through both cham-
bers, despite publicly claiming they support 
it. 
On Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.), 
the co-sponsor of the, Senate’s version of the 
bill, pushed to add it as an amendment to 
the National Defense Authorization Act, a 
must-pass piece of legislation. 
Senate Democrats objected under a proce-
dural rule that bars amendments that affect 
appropriations. Rubio called that a dodge. 
‘‘This is about the fact that they don’t want 
this bill to pass over at the House,’’ Rubio 
said on the Senate floor, referring directly to 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.). 
Rubio also said U.S. corporations that 
profit from forced labor in China, such as 
Apple and Nike, have been lobbying against 
the bill, which is true. On Thursday, Pelosi 
denied Rubia’s accusations of stalling and 
promised 
her 
chamber 
would 
pass 
the 
House’s version of the legislation, introduced 
by Rep. Jim McGovern (D–Mass.), which the 
House passed last year 406 to 3. In an inter-
view, McGovern told me his bill will be voted 
on and likely passed again in the House next 
week. But if and when that happens, that 
won’t be the end. The two chambers will still 
have passed two different versions of the bill, 
with no firm plan for how to reconcile them. 
Meanwhile, Biden administration officials 
have been quietly telling lawmakers to slow 
down. 
Administration 
sources 
confirmed 
that in an October call between Deputy Sec-
retary of State Wendy R. Sherman and Sen. 
Jeff Merkley (D–Ore.), the other co-sponsor, 
Sherman made it clear that the administra-
tion prefers a more targeted and deliberative 
approach to determining which goods are the 
products of forced labor. She also told 
Merkley that getting allied buy-in was crit-
ical and more effective than unilateral ac-
tion. 
‘‘To be clear, the Department of State is 
not opposing this amendment,’’ a State De-
partment spokesman told me. ‘‘We share the 
Congress’ concerns about forced labor in 
Xinjiang.’’ In other words, while the admin-
istration supports the legislation in public, 
they are asking Democrats to essentially 
water it down in private. Sherman’s specific 
criticism relates to a part of the bill that 
would require a presumption that all prod-
ucts coming from Xinjiang are tainted by 
forced labor unless the importer can prove 
otherwise. This happens to be the exact pro-
vision corporations are also objecting to. 
Maybe it’s a coincidence. 
‘‘It isn’t partisan or in any way controver-
sial for the U.S. to be unequivocally, re-
soundingly opposed to genocide and slave 
labor,’’ Merkley told me. ‘‘The Senate passed 
this legislation in July, and it’s time to get 
it over the finish line.’’ 
There is a legitimate concern that supply 
chains for everything from solar panels to 
sneakers could be affected by the bill. But 
our dependency on products from an area 
where genocide is occurring is the root of the 
problem. Passing the bill now would send in-
dustry a clear signal to speed up what they 
are already doing, which is to stop doing 
business in areas riddled with forced labor. 
Also, forced labor products from China put 
U.S. manufacturers at a severe disadvantage. 
‘‘We must shine a light on the inhumane 
practice of forced labor, hold the perpetra-
tors accountable and stop this exploitation,’’ 
Pelosi said while passing the bill last year. 
‘‘And we must send a clear message to Bei-
jing: These abuses must end now.’’ 
Another year has gone and the bill still 
lingers. Pelosi has been a champion for 
human rights in China for decades, but the 
fight is not over and the ball is in her court. 
Overall, it’s up to both parties and both 
chambers to act to stop a genocide now. 
There’s no good reason to delay. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. We have 
no access, Mr. Speaker, to the con-
centration camps in Xinjiang. We have 
no idea the supply chains. It is closed. 
It is a dictatorship. There are no onsite 
inspections. Again, we are talking 
genocide against these Muslims who 
are being wiped off the face of the 
Earth. 
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act prohibits imports from Xinjiang to 
the United States by creating a rebut-
table presumption. That is the core of 
this bill, that all goods produced in the 
region are made with forced labor un-
less U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion certifies by clear and convincing 
evidence that goods were not produced 
with forced labor. So the rebuttable 
presumption is the key to this legisla-
tion. 
It is very workable. As my good 
friend and colleague noted, cotton, 
solar panels, and so many other things 
are produced there. We need to know. 
We need to stop them from coming 
here. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Again, if 
these companies can prove that it is 
not made by forced labor, not made as 
part of this genocide, then it would be 
welcomed here. But we know that is 
unlikely to happen. 
My hope is that we will unite—Re-
publican and Democrat, Democrat and 
Republican—around this bill and get it 
to the President as soon as humanly 
possible. 
Delay is denial. People are being 
slaughtered each and every day in 
Xinjiang, and we can do something, 
maybe not a whole lot, but something 
to mitigate and stop this. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from the 
great State of New York (Mr. SUOZZI), 
who is on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and everyone who has 
worked so hard on this, including 
Chairman MCGOVERN. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as 
chair of the Congressional Uyghur Cau-
cus and as a member of the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China 
to support passage of the bipartisan 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. 
We need to wake up from our torpor. 
It has been reported for years, but I 
don’t think most Americans realize ex-
actly what is going on in China. 
It was almost 50 years ago that Nixon 
went to China, and we have always be-
lieved that the more the Chinese Gov-
ernment and the people were exposed 
to the United States and the West, our 
way of life, our democracy, and our 
economic system, the more they would 
become like us, the more they would 
adopt concepts of freedom of expres-
sion, 
free 
markets, 
and 
minority 
rights. 
Well, that simply hasn’t happened. 
Everyone in this body has seen reliable 
reports and clear documentation of 
crimes against humanity: forced labor, 
forced sterilization, mass surveillance, 
government-run detention camps, mass 
detention, sexual violence, and torture 
against the Uyghur people. 
b 1345 
The Chinese Communist Party is 
even forcing people to eat pork during 
Ramadan, even though it violates peo-
ple’s religion. 
It is hard to imagine that in today’s 
world, that forced labor camps are hap-
pening, and we know about it. And 
today, we are standing up to do some-
thing about it. 
The Chinese Communist Party must 
be held accountable. We have rules in 
place now that say you can’t use forced 
labor. But this bill is a major step for-
ward in mandating that everything 
that comes out of Xinjiang in China 
will be presumed to be using forced 
labor and, therefore, ineligible to be 
sold into the U.S. supply chain. This is 
going to have a tremendous impact. 
An overwhelming amount of cotton 
in the world comes from China, for ex-
ample. Mr. Speaker, 84 percent of that 
cotton that comes from China comes 
from the Xinjiang region. Some people 
are going to say, Oh, my gosh, if we 
don’t do business with Xinjiang, then 
the cost of products are going to go up. 
Well, that is too damn bad. This should 
shock everyone’s conscience. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, we have to 
do everything we can to stand up for 
our values. The world is watching us, 
and it starts with the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act becoming law. 
Let’s do this, and let’s do it together. 
We recognize here in our country 
that we went through a period of slav-
ery. That is why it is so offensive to us 
now to see slavery actually happening 
in the world as we speak, where both 
administrations, the prior administra-
tion and this administration, have both 
said this is genocide. Standing up to-
gether in a bipartisan way is so impor-
tant. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT), a member of 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr.

I 
thank 
the 
Republican 
lead, 
Mr. 
MCCAUL, for yielding. And Chairman 
MEEKS, you are a force in the House 
gymnasium. You are a force on the 
House floor, and I appreciate you, 
brother. 
The Chinese Communist Party does 
anything it can to get ahead of the 
United States, Mr. Speaker. It steals

our intellectual property and uses 
Uyghur slave labor to manufacture 
products. It is threatening the freedom 
of folks from Taiwan to Hong Kong. 
Our government needs to stand up to 
them. 
Today, we are acknowledging some of 
the Chinese Communist Party’s hor-
rible, horrible behaviors. It is not 
enough. Additional action is needed, 
Mr. Speaker. 
The Chinese Communist Party knows 
there are no consequences for its be-
havior. That needs to change. It starts 
with the Biden administration. They 
need to do more than just finger-wag-
ging to effectively counter China. This 
administration needs to make it clear 
to the Chinese Communist Party that 
bad behavior will be met with action, 
not empty words. 
President Biden also needs to set 
aside his climate agenda when address-
ing the Chinese Communist Party. His 
administration tried to kill the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Protection Act because 
the Uyghurs mine the polysilicon for 
our solar panels. It is gross that this 
administration wants to let Uyghur 
slavery slide to advance its climate 
agenda. 
I am glad we have these bills on the 
floor today. It is a start, but more 
work needs to be done. I hope in the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, both par-
ties can work together and hold the 
Chinese Communist Party accountable, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I proudly 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
the great State of Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy. 
Congress passed a law almost a cen-
tury ago prohibiting the importation of 
goods made with forced labor. But, you 
know, it was really never enforced. 
That changed in 2016, potentially, 
when we passed legislation to elimi-
nate the consumptive demand loophole 
that allowed people a way around. 
Well, it is time that we finish the job. 
Nothing is more chilling than what 
the Chinese are doing to the Uyghur 
people. I have chaired meetings of our 
Trade Subcommittee that were really 
appalling. It is Orwellian in terms of 
what they are doing to detain Uyghurs 
in 
internment, 
re-education, 
slave 
labor camps; that international con-
cern the Chinese think will just remain 
on the sideline. 
Now, there are many American com-
panies that are attempting to deal with 
this, but we need to do more. We need 
to strengthen their resolve, and we 
need to be able to get the attention of 
the Chinese Government. 
A stronger regime is absolutely nec-
essary. Crimes against humanity re-
quire a response. We must not just vote 
our support for the Uyghur people and 
other minorities across China. We need 
to make sure that we are clear about 
who gets the benefit of the doubt. 
More than a million Uyghurs have 
been enslaved; half of them forced to 
harvest cotton, one of the Xinjiang re-
gion’s largest exports. When American 
consumers buy a shirt, they shouldn’t 
have questions about whether or not 
that was made with forced labor. 
I strongly support this legislation to 
ensure that American dollars aren’t in-
advertently 
contributing 
to 
forced 
labor. That is the language that the 
Chinese understand; denying them ac-
cess to our markets and making sure 
that people are responsible for their 
supply chain. 
This legislation, I think, is a great 
start. I am pleased that there is bipar-
tisan support for it. I hope we enact it, 
and then we work together to make 
sure that it is enforced. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. RICE), a member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, China is a global thief. We all 
know it. They steal American intellec-
tual property. They steal American 
jobs using currency manipulation, ille-
gal subsidies, and product dumping to 
kill American competition. And worst 
of all, they produce products with slave 
labor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1155, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act. H.R. 1155’s central pro-
vision establishes a rebuttable pre-
sumption that all goods made in Chi-
na’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion are produced with forced labor. 
Since 2017, China has arbitrarily de-
tained and persecuted over 1 million 
Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in 
extrajudicial, mass re-education camps 
in Xinjiang. We know that China is 
seeking to profit from the oppression 
by subsidizing companies to build fac-
tories near these mass internment 
sites. 
H.R. 1155 leverages the power of our 
enormous market to send China a mes-
sage that it cannot use its policies of 
repression to subsidize its exports. We 
must work with our allies to ensure 
that all global markets are closed to 
the products of Chinese theft and re-
pression. 
A core and essential provision of this 
bill is a rebuttable presumption that 
leads to an import prohibition. In 2016, 
the Ways and Means Committee led the 
way on a bipartisan basis in elimi-
nating the consumptive demand loop-
hole from the outright ban on products 
made with forced labor in Section 307 
of the 1930 Tariff Act. 
A few years later, we have worked 
with our USMCA partners to extend 
the U.S. ban on products produced with 
forced labor throughout North Amer-
ica. We are now leading the world in 
combating forced labor in Xinjiang. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. For that 
reason, we wish that our Democratic 
colleagues on the Ways and Means 
Committee had worked with us to up-
date the bill from the version that 
passed 14 months ago to ensure that it 
establishes the most effective mecha-
nism 
for 
blocking 
imports 
from 
Xinjiang, while providing much-needed 
clarity to facilitate trade by good ac-
tors. 
Just as importantly, we know that 
China has anticipated this ban by ex-
panding this practice beyond Xinjiang. 
We need to work closely with our col-
leagues in the Senate to ensure that 
the version of the bill that becomes law 
can better assist importers to identify 
and proactively eradicate goods pro-
duced with forced labor from their sup-
ply chains, whether they arise in 
Xinjiang or in other locations. 
This bill is just the beginning, but it 
sends a strong signal to China that it 
cannot launder its policies of persecu-
tion and repression in a global market. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I proudly 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the great State of Virginia (Ms. 
WEXTON). 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MEEKS, Speaker PELOSI, and 
Chairman MCGOVERN for bringing this 
important legislation to the floor and 
shining a light on the atrocities taking 
place in Xinjiang. 
I represent the largest Uyghur dias-
pora in the U.S. and this legislation is 
critically important to the Uyghur 
community. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of this legislation that will prohibit 
the importation of goods from Xinjiang 
unless it can be proven by clear and 
convincing evidence that they were not 
made with forced labor. 
Despite international condemnation, 
the Chinese Government’s brutal cam-
paign of repressive surveillance, mass 
detention, forced labor, and even geno-
cide, is rapidly expanding, and we must 
take steps to ensure that U.S. compa-
nies and consumers are not complicit 
in the abuses. 
This legislation will hold the PRC ac-
countable for these heinous acts and 
will make it clear that the U.S. will 
not turn a blind eye to the plight of the 
Uyghurs. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I know there is another 
bill by Senator RUBIO. I hope this bill, 
when it passes, can be worked out in 
the Senate, and I hope the administra-
tion will not slow-roll this important 
measure, as has been reported. 
Out of this region we have batteries 
and solar panels. When Secretary John 
Kerry 
testified, 
he 
admitted 
that 
Xinjiang’s solar panel production pre-
sents a problem for U.S. climate strat-
egy, and I agree with him. 
In recent years, the world has stood 
by as the Chinese Communist Party 
has detained more than 1 million eth-
nic minorities in concentration camps 
where they are tortured, brainwashed, 
and put into forced labor. This is all a

part of a deliberate program by the 
CCP to wipe out their ethnic identity, 
their religion, and their culture, any-
thing that might compete with the 
Communist Party for their loyalties 
and affection. 
We have a moral duty to speak out 
against these horrifying crimes; but we 
have an even greater duty to avoid 
funding this genocide by paying for 
slave labor in Xinjiang. 
Many American companies have built 
their businesses on values that include 
respect for basic human rights. The 
United States must continue to lead 
the world in setting corporate responsi-
bility standards. There can no longer 
be business as usual with China. China 
is watching and the world is watching. 
I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
I am happy that this bipartisan effort 
dealing with the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act is an opportunity for 
this body to send a resounding message 
to the world that we are engaged in a 
strategic 
competition 
with 
China 
around the world. And our stance on 
this issue, I believe, will define why our 
system is better. 
But I must reply to some comments. 
One, the comment that President 
Biden is holding us up. Well, I am the 
chair of this committee, he has never 
told me to hold up anything. In fact, he 
wants to move forward. 
In fact, it is President Biden who has 
sanctioned 
officials 
responsible 
for 
genocide 
and 
issued 
supply 
chain 
advisories in Xinjiang. 
The fact of the matter is, I think our 
bill is far superior. You go to the Sen-
ate side, the Senate says, this should 
take 300 days to stop. Our bill says 120 
days. 
For me, this is a personal situation. 
So I would wish that some of my col-
leagues who, rightfully, want to make 
sure that we send a strong message to 
the world that we are not going to 
stand for genocide. We are not going to 
stand for slave labor. 
But it is best if they would join us 
about injustice in America. It is best if 
we fought together to make sure that 
when President Trump talked about a 
Muslim ban in the United States of 
America—that wasn’t Joe Biden—we 
can’t do it in America. That is the best 
way to lead. 
b 1400 
When we talk about moving, I want 
to condemn it everywhere. Dr. King 
said: Injustice anywhere is a threat to 
justice everywhere. 
We should lead by example collec-
tively. We should lead by going forward 
with voting rights. We should lead by 
talking about reparations for those 
who were enslaved in America. We 
should lead by talking about the geno-
cide that took place to Native Ameri-
cans. We should lead by talking about 
the injustice in housing. We should 
lead by talking about civil rights. 
So we have got to come together and 
stop it everywhere, and that is what 
this bill does. It sends a strong mes-
sage. I want to be that example. 
This just happens to be personal, so I 
had to say it. I don’t like to put poli-
tics in these things, but I do like to tell 
the truth. 
Mr. Speaker, we have got to work to-
gether. I want to thank especially Mr. 
MCCAUL. I have got to say this, too, in 
closing. I have got to say this in clos-
ing, because Mr. MCCAUL is my friend, 
and we work very closely together. I 
know his spirit and his heart, and he 
stands up. I look forward on this com-
mittee to continue to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I salute 
the distinguished chairman of the For-
eign Affairs Committee for his leader-
ship in bringing this legislation to the 
floor. It is historic. 
I want to join him in saluting Mr. 
MCCAUL, who has been a champion for 
human rights. We have worked to-
gether for years on these subjects. I 
thank them both for their leadership. 
As has been recognized earlier, Mr. 
Speaker, this week marks a momen-
tous milestone in human history. Sev-
enty-three years ago tomorrow, the 
international community convened in 
Paris to approve the United Nations 
Genocide Convention. 
In doing so, the world forged an his-
toric commitment to always condemn 
and combat the crime of genocide, 
which they had defined 2 years prior as: 
‘‘a denial of the right of existence,’’ 
which ‘‘shocks the conscience of man-
kind’’ and is ‘‘a matter of international 
concern.’’ 
Today, in some ways, we are falling 
short on that promise. 
In its latest Human Rights Report, 
our own State Department has defini-
tively declared that the barbaric op-
pression of the Uyghurs by the Govern-
ment of China amounts to genocide. We 
salute the administration for that rec-
ognition. 
New research by the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum sheds 
light on these crimes, with a survivor 
describing Beijing’s intentions as: ‘‘to 
make us slowly disappear, so slowly 
that no one would notice.’’ 
Indeed, the erasure of the Uyghurs is 
precisely the definition of genocide 
from three-quarters of a century ago. 
That is why, with the strong bipar-
tisan package of legislation we will 
pass today, the House takes yet an-
other bold, bipartisan step to counter 
these crimes against humanity. 
We are honoring the challenge to our 
conscience, and I thank Chairman 
MEEKS and Ranking Member MCCAUL. 
Congress and the country are grateful 
to the relentless leaders of the legisla-
tion before us. 
At the helm of the Congressional-Ex-
ecutive Commission on China, as well 
as the Tom Lantos Human Rights Com-
mission, Chairman JIM MCGOVERN has 
long served as a voice for the voiceless, 
not only in China, but around the 
world. 
With his Uyghur Forced Labor Pre-
vention Act, we are taking decisive ac-
tion against the exploitation of the 
Uyghur people. We are stepping up to 
the plate. 
I salute, again, Congressman MI-
CHAEL MCCAUL for a resounding resolu-
tion condemning the genocide of the 
Uyghurs in China. 
Thank you to Congresswoman JEN-
NIFER WEXTON for her resolution de-
manding 
that 
Beijing 
immediately 
guarantee the safety and freedom of 
tennis star Peng Shuai. 
I also thank Chairman GREGORY 
MEEKS, Chairman RICHARD NEAL, and 
Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS for their 
longstanding leadership in the House’s 
fight against forced labor. 
Together, this legislation, which we 
will pass today, makes unequivocally 
clear the House’s firm commitment to 
human rights in China and does so in a 
bipartisan way. 
That has always been the case over 
time. CHRIS
SMITH and I have been 
working on these issues for decades to-
gether, with others such as Frank 
Wolf, who was here before him, and 
with many others on both sides of the 
aisle. 
Right now, Beijing is orchestrating a 
brutal and accelerating campaign of re-
pression against the Uyghur people and 
other Muslim minorities. 
In Xinjiang and across China, mil-
lions are enduring outrageous human 
rights abuses, from mass surveillance 
and discriminatory policing to mass 
torture, including solitary confinement 
and forced sterilization, to intimida-
tion of journalists and activists who 
have dared to expose the truth. And 
the Chinese Government’s exploitation 
of forced labor reaches across the 
oceans to our shores and across the 
world. 
They always say that the most hor-
rible form of torture to a prisoner, or 
somebody in one of these camps, is to 
say to them: Nobody knows you are 
even here; nobody even cares about 
you. 
We 
want 
those 
people, 
the 
Uyghurs and others oppressed in China, 
to know that we do care about them, 
we know many of them by name, and 
we will never forget our responsibility 
to act upon the actions that the Chi-
nese Government is engaged in. 
That is why the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Protection Act employs Amer-
ica’s great economic might to combat 
this brutality and hold the perpetra-
tors accountable by blocking certain 
imports produced with forced labor, 
leveling sanctions against the per-
petrators, and imposing disclosure re-
quirements on companies engaged in 
Xinjiang. 
With this strong, bipartisan legisla-
tion, we are better able to fight forced 
labor, we shine a bright light on this 
pattern of abuse, and we send Beijing a 
clear message that this genocide must 
end now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7504 
December 8, 2021 
As we focus on this genocide against 
the Uyghurs, we must also remember 
Beijing’s 
decades-long 
assault 
on 
human rights. 
Those of us who have long been in 
this fight for human rights in China 
have seen a regime of terror and re-
pression that has only intensified: from 
Tibet to Taiwan; to assaults on basic 
freedoms in Hong Kong and beyond; to 
jailing of journalists and detaining of 
dissidents; and more. 
In Congress, for decades, we have 
taken strong bipartisan actions fight-
ing for human rights in China. 
That is why, in 1991, Democrats and 
Republicans stood up together for free 
speech during a visit to Tiananmen 
Square just 2 years after the govern-
ment’s infamous crackdown. 
That is why, in 1993, in a bipartisan 
way, we convinced the world that Chi-
na’s dismal record on human rights dis-
qualified the nation from hosting the 
2000 Olympic Games. 
That is why, in 2000, I took to this 
floor to urge my colleagues to block 
China from the World Trade Organiza-
tion, arguing that we should not put 
deals ahead of ideals. China has not 
honored the agreement. 
That is why, in 2015, working to-
gether, we had a Congressional delega-
tion to Tibet to see the aspirations in 
the eyes of the schoolchildren who 
have endured China’s and Beijing’s in-
timidation. 
That is why, in 2019, working to-
gether, we sounded the alarms as the 
Chinese Government locked up pro-de-
mocracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. 
Democrats and Republicans, House 
and Senate, have come together to 
enact strong policies standing up for 
human rights in China, including: the 
Tibet Policy and Support Act, the 
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act, and the Uyghur Human 
Rights Policy Act; all enacted into law, 
signed into law. 
For decades, many of us have fought 
against what they call normal trade re-
lations with China, because, as the 
world’s strongest economy, America 
has a moral duty to tie our trade rela-
tions with human rights. 
When China joined the WTO 20 years 
ago this week, the world gave Beijing a 
blank check to prosper from its abuses 
while simply hoping it would change 
its behavior. 
Many of us knew then, as we still 
know today, that this approach was 
fated for failure. Today’s legislation 
will help right this wrong. 
We must respond with more than leg-
islation. We must show leadership. 
As House Speaker, I applaud and sup-
port President Biden’s strong leader-
ship in announcing there will be no of-
ficial U.S. presence at the 2022 Winter 
Olympics. 
Allowing a country with an abysmal 
human rights record to host the games 
makes a mockery of the Olympic Char-
ter, which states that the games should 
seek to foster ‘‘respect for universal 
and fundamental ethical principles.’’ 
Make no mistake: our athletes can 
and should be celebrated. But this 
year, we should celebrate them from 
home. They can be there; we should be 
home. 
As noted, when I called for the diplo-
matic boycott last May, the world 
must not reward more than three dec-
ades of abusive and repressive actions 
by the Chinese Government by giving 
our official imprimatur to China. 
I thank Mr. MCCAUL for his leader-
ship, particularly in calling out the 
Olympic Committee for making this 
choice. 
Mr. Speaker, today we have an oppor-
tunity to forge further progress in the 
fight for human rights in China, a fight 
that many of us have been extraor-
dinarily proud to help lead over our ca-
reers in Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, if we do not speak out 
for human rights in China because of 
commercial or economic ties, we lose 
all moral authority to speak out 
against human rights violations any-
where in the world. 
We must never fail to live up to our 
sacred duty to safeguard the dignity 
and worth of every person and build a 
better future for generations to come. 
Proudly, this legislation, all of it— 
Mr. MCCAUL’s, Mr. MCGOVERN’s, and 
Ms. WEXTON’s leadership, the leader-
ship of the chairman, Mr. MEEKS, and 
ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, of the 
committee—has earned overwhelming 
bipartisan support when we passed it in 
the House last year. I hope we will do 
so again this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote for 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act and the other legislation that is 
before us this afternoon and do so ask-
ing for a very strong bipartisan vote so 
that we know that we will have the 
numbers to send a message to the Chi-
nese Government that this is bipar-
tisan, bicameral, on both sides of the 
Capitol, and a view shared by the 
President of the United States. I ask 
for an ‘‘aye’’ vote all around. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I just have 
these last remarks. 
I also want to thank Mr. SMITH. As 
indicated by the Speaker, from the 
time that I have been in Congress, his 
focus has been on human rights around 
the world. As the Speaker indicated, 
and as I indicated with Mr. MCCAUL 
and you will see coming up with these 
other bills, we have worked collec-
tively, leaving politics out of it, fo-
cused on leading the world. That is 
what I look forward to, locking arms, 
sending that message around the world 
that we are not going to allow slave 
labor to flourish and to exist on this 
planet. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, ending forced 
labor—and holding China accountable for 
these gross abuses of human rights—must be 
a global effort. America should lead the world 
in halting China’s brutality, and all democ-
racies around the world should join us. 
As I’ve said many times, this is a completely 
bipartisan issue, as demonstrated by the over-
whelming bipartisan vote in the House on a 
similar bill in September 2020. The United 
States has no tolerance for China’s human 
rights abuses, in Xinjiang or anywhere. 
There are real challenges to further tighten 
the dragnet around China and force it to elimi-
nate atrocities, while supporting legitimate 
trade. All of us agree: we want to create op-
portunities for our producers to comply with 
the law while removing forced labor from our 
global supply chains. 
And just as important, we must urge our 
trading partners to work with us. Inexplicably, 
this entirely bipartisan issue has been pushed 
to the back burner, with Democrats delaying 
consideration for 14 months. And Ways & 
Means did not mark this bill up or update the 
trade provisions in any way. This is difficult to 
understand, because a core provision of this 
bill, which is the rebuttable presumption that 
importation of goods made in Xinjiang must be 
blocked because they are made with forced 
labor, is clearly in our Committee’s jurisdiction. 
This issue is not only bipartisan. It’s bi-
cameral. Both the House and the Senate have 
strong bills that send a clear and unequivocal 
message: the United States has zero toler-
ance for these abuses. 
While I’m disappointed that this was de-
layed, taking strong action today is an impor-
tant step. 
Republicans support strong and effective 
legislation that addresses China’s atrocities 
while supporting legitimate trade, and I look 
forward to working with the Senate to perfect 
our approach and enact this bill into law 
promptly. 
It is vital that we stop the scourge of mod-
ern-day slavery in China.

H. RES. 837 
Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time 
Olympian Peng Shuai went missing after she 
said in a since-deleted post on Chinese social 
media site Weibo that she had been sexually 
assaulted and forced into a sexual relation-
ship with Zhang Gaoli, who was the senior 
Vice Premier of the State Council of the 
People’s Republic of China (PRC) from 2013 
to 2018; 
Whereas PRC authorities have imposed a 
media and internet blackout of discussions 
of Peng’s case, and the words ‘‘tennis’’ and 
the surname ‘‘Peng’’ have been censored on-
line within China; 
Whereas, on November 14, 2021, after Peng 
had not been seen or heard from for 12 days, 
Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) CEO 
Steve Simon requested a ‘‘full and trans-
parent’’ investigation into Peng’s allega-
tions; 
Whereas 
the 
hashtag 
‘‘#WhereIsPengShuai’’ trended across social 
media worldwide, with the exception of the 
PRC where it is censored; 
Whereas, on November 17, 2021, the WTA 
received a statement purporting to be from 
Peng, recanting her abuse claim and saying 
‘‘everything is fine’’; 
Whereas in response, WTA CEO Steve 
Simon said the response ‘‘released today by 
Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai 
only raises my concerns as to her safety and 
whereabouts’’; 
Whereas in response, the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) said in a state-
ment that it was ‘‘encouraged by assurance 
that she is safe’’; 
Whereas, on November 19 and 20, 2021, 
photos and videos of Peng appearing in her 
home, in a restaurant, and at a youth tennis 
event in Beijing emerged on Twitter ac-
counts 
affiliated 
with 
government-run 
media, and at the same time, Peng has not 
spoken directly with the media or the WTA; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, White 
House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the 
White House is ‘‘deeply concerned’’ over 
Peng’s 
disappearance 
and 
seeks 
‘‘inde-
pendent and verifiable proof’’ of her location 
and condition; 
Whereas, 
on 
November 
19, 
2021, 
Liz 
Throssell, the spokesperson of the United 
Nations Human Rights office, told reporters 
‘‘. . .it would be important to have proof of 
her whereabouts and wellbeing, and we 
would urge that there be an investigation 
with full transparency into her allegations of 
sexual assault’’; 
Whereas, on November 21, 2021, the IOC 
said in a statement that its President, 
Thomas Bach, had a 30-minute video call 
with 3-time Olympian Peng Shuai, joined by 
a Chinese sports official and an IOC official; 
Whereas the statement said that, during 
the call, Peng appeared to be ‘‘doing fine’’ 
and ‘‘relaxed’’, and said she ‘‘would like to 
have her privacy respected’’; 
Whereas the IOC did not explain how the 
video call with Peng had been organized, 
given the difficulties other concerned parties 
have had reaching her; 
Whereas, on November 30, 2021, IOC official 
Dick Pound in an interview with CNN de-
fended the Chinese Government’s handling of 
the situation and said the ‘‘unanimous con-
clusion’’ by IOC officials on the call is that 
Peng Shuai is ‘‘fine’’; 
Whereas the annual report of the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China for 
2020 finds that gender-based violence in 
China remains a serious issue, and highly 
publicized cases of sexual assault continue to 
surface; 
Whereas, on December 1, 2021, the WTA 
suspended all WTA tournaments in China 
and Hong Kong; 
Whereas WTA chairman Steve Simon stat-
ed, ‘‘In good conscience, I don’t see how I can 
ask our athletes to compete there when Peng 
Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely 
and has seemingly been pressured to con-
tradict her allegation of sexual assault. 
Given the current state of affairs, I am also 
greatly concerned about the risks that all of 
our players and staff could face if we were to 
hold events in China in 2022.’’; 
Whereas the PRC has repeatedly detained 
‘‘#MeToo’’ activists in China and censored 
online and public discussion around sexual 
assault and harassment; and 
Whereas athletes from the around the 
world are headed to Beijing for the Olympic 
games starting in February 2022: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House 
of Representatives that— 
(1) the case of Peng Shuai is directly re-
lated to broader international concerns 
around the freedom of speech and safety of 
athletes participating in the 2022 Olympics 
in Beijing; 
(2) the International Olympic Committee’s 
(IOC) role in legitimizing the People’s Re-
public of China’s (PRC) claims about Peng’s 
safety raise questions about the organiza-
tion’s ability and willingness to protect the 
rights of athletes participating in the 2022 
Olympic and Paralympic games in Beijing; 
(3) the PRC would help reduce concerns 
about athlete safety at the Beijing Olympics 
by assuring Peng’s freedom and safety and 
investigating her allegations in a fair and 
transparent manner; 
(4) the PRC should immediately take steps 
to— 
(A) provide independent and verifiable 
proof of Peng’s whereabouts and that she is 
safe; 
(B) allow Peng to engage directly with the 
WTA and the United Nations to independ-
ently verify her safety and explain her ab-
sence from public life since making her alle-
gation; 
(C) open an independent and transparent 
investigation into Peng’s allegations against 
former senior Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli; 
(D) publicly commit to hold sexual vio-
lence abusers accountable; 
(E) cease all censorship of reporting and 
discussions of Peng’s case; and 
(F) allow Peng to leave China if she so de-
sires, and prevent any retaliation against 
family members remaining there; 
(5) by acquiescing to the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s narrative, the IOC failed to 
adhere to its own human rights commit-
ments and protect the safety and free speech 
of Olympic athletes; 
(6) the IOC’s conduct has undermined the 
efforts by the United States Government, 
human rights organizations, the Women’s 
Tennis Association, and other international 
bodies and individuals to secure Peng’s safe-
ty; and 
(7) in an effort to regain lost public con-
fidence, the IOC should publicly call on the 
Government of the PRC to undertake the ac-
tions called for in paragraph (4). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
837. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H. Res. 837, 
as amended, expressing the sense of the 
House of Representatives that Beijing 
should 
immediately 
guarantee 
the 
safety and the freedom of tennis star 
Peng Shuai, introduced by the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON). 
Last month, former Wimbledon wom-
en’s doubles champion and three-time 
Olympian Peng Shuai accused former 
Vice Premier of the State Council 
Zhang Gaoli of committing sexual as-
sault and forcing her into a sexual rela-
tionship. 
After these groundbreaking allega-
tions were made, the first sexual as-
sault allegation to implicate a high- 
ranking Chinese official, Peng seem-
ingly vanished into thin air, and Chi-
na’s great firewall went into overdrive, 
deleting the original post, censoring 
any mention of Peng’s name or discus-
sion of her allegations online. 
We know that here in America, sex-
ual assault and gender-based violence 
are serious problems, and it took a 
movement of brave women and their 
allies to start changing the conversa-
tion around our workplaces and our 
homes and in our schools and commu-
nities. 
Due to the action of journalists, the 
tennis community, activists, and social 
media users across the globe who start-
ed to ask about Peng’s whereabouts, 
there has been tremendous attention 
given to her case. However, I, like 
many of my colleagues, remain deeply 
concerned about Peng’s whereabouts 
and well-being. It is vital that we get 
assurances that Peng is safe and her 
ability to speak out is not constrained. 
This important, bipartisan resolution 
calls for independent and verifiable 
proof that she is safe and free to make 
decisions and take actions of her own 
free will. 
The accusations of sexual abuse by a 
former senior official are very serious, 
and this resolution calls for the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of 
China to immediately conduct a for-
mal, transparent, and independent in-
vestigation. 
At a time when we are preparing to 
send hundreds of American athletes to 
compete in Beijing’s Winter Olympics, 
this resolution calls on the Inter-
national Olympic Committee to do 
more to ensure athlete safety and hold 
the PRC Government accountable for 
its actions against Peng. 
This is timely and is also an urgent 
resolution. I support it, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Services and ranking member of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7506 
December 8, 2021 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee’s Subcommittee on Research 
and Technology and also the Repub-
lican coauthor of this bill. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, as my col-
league, Mr. MEEKS, eloquently men-
tioned, it is worth repeating again that 
Peng Shuai on November 2 posted on 
her social media account a detailed al-
legation of sexual abuse against a 
former Vice Premier of the People’s 
Republic of China, a very senior offi-
cial. 
In her post, she said: ‘‘I couldn’t de-
scribe how disgusted I was and how 
many times I asked myself, am I still a 
human? I feel like a walking corpse.’’ 
It shouldn’t surprise anybody that 
the 
CCP, 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, immediately censored her post 
and any mention of these allegations 
and basically wiped it off the face of 
the Earth. She has since been absent 
and unresponsive to friends except for 
a clearly fabricated statement and 
video in a clearly coerced session, 
shamefully with International Olympic 
Committee officials. 
This would be like if a U.S. tennis 
star made an accusation, a credible 
one, of sexual abuse against a Vice 
President of the United States, and 
then she disappeared. That is what es-
sentially has happened. 
On November 21, the IOC said in a 
statement that its president, Thomas 
Bach, had a 30-minute video call but 
yet wouldn’t release the video after-
ward. The IOC’s participation in this 
charade is a disgrace. 
After the call, IOC official Dick 
Pound said it is the IOC’s unanimous 
conclusion by IOC officials that Peng is 
fine. 
This is the definition of perpetuating 
CCP propaganda. It is exactly the oppo-
site of what we should expect in the 
world. 
The Women’s Tennis Association has 
demanded 
accountability, 
demanded 
that her whereabouts be disclosed, that 
she be able to talk to colleagues and 
friends, and that her sexual assault al-
legation be taken seriously and fully 
investigated. 
Importantly, unlike the National 
Basketball Association, the Olympics, 
and so many others, the WTA has said 
they are going to forgo any future 
tournaments in China, which is a sig-
nificant, significant portion of their 
revenue. In short, they are putting 
their money where their mouth is. 
They are walking the walk, not just 
talking the talk. 
This is exactly why we cannot send 
our athletes to the Beijing Olympics. 
We cannot guarantee their safety. We 
cannot turn a blind eye to the ongoing 
genocide. We cannot allow American 
companies that want to preach social 
justice here in the United States be-
cause it helps their balance sheet to 
then ignore basic human rights when it 
comes to China to also pad their bal-
ance sheet. 
I would ask any of my colleagues, 
when it comes to the Winter Olympics, 
did they agree with the IOC stepping 
into politics when it comes to apart-
heid? The IOC not only banned the 
Olympics from happening in South Af-
rica under apartheid, but they banned 
the South African Olympic Committee 
from participating in the Olympics for 
30 years. 
Yet when it comes to China, when it 
comes to the abuses of the Chinese 
Communist Party, we have a whole 
heck of a lot of silence. If we won’t 
take a stand now, what will we take a 
stand for? 
I support the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MCCAUL), the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS), and the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON) in 
this important effort. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
WEXTON), the sponsor of this bill along 
with the cosponsor, Mr. WALTZ. 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MEEKS for bringing this bill 
to the floor and to Speaker PELOSI for 
her steadfast commitment to holding 
the PRC accountable for its human 
rights abuses. Thank you also to my 
colead on the resolution, the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WALTZ). It 
has been a pleasure to work with him 
in such a bipartisan way. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of my resolution calling on the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to immediately 
guarantee the safety and freedom of 
Peng Shuai and condemning the Inter-
national Olympic Committee for its 
shameful handling of the situation and 
failure to uphold its own human rights 
standards. 
Over 1 month has passed since tennis 
superstar and three-time Olympian 
Peng Shuai was censored and dis-
appeared after alleging her rape by a 
senior member of China’s Communist 
Party. 
Within minutes of posting the allega-
tions on Chinese social media site 
Weibo, the post disappeared, and short-
ly thereafter all mentions of Peng on 
social media did, too. 
Since then, Peng has not been seen or 
heard from in public and has only been 
seen in videos released by the Chinese 
state media, raising serious questions 
about her safety and freedom and leav-
ing the world to ask: Where is Peng 
Shuai? 
Her case has drawn support from all 
over the world, including from tennis 
stars Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams, 
and Novak Djokovic. The hashtag 
‘‘Where is Peng Shuai’’ has trended 
globally on Twitter. 
Women’s Tennis Association CEO 
Steve Simon called for a full and trans-
parent investigation into Peng’s alle-
gations and eventually suspended all 
WTA tournaments in China, citing con-
cerns about the risks players could face 
at the hands of the PRC. 
The WTA’s actions and Peng’s brav-
ery in coming forward stand in stark 
contrast to the IOC, which is under-
mining efforts to secure Peng’s safety 
by working hand-in-hand with Beijing 
to cover up her allegations and dis-
appearance. 
Instead of prioritizing the safety of 
an Olympian who may be in danger, 
the IOC is once again putting its bot-
tom line over athletes’ safety and al-
lowing itself to be used as a tool by the 
world’s worst human rights abuser. 
In a matter of weeks, our athletes 
will be in Beijing for the opening cere-
monies of the 2022 Winter Games, and 
the IOC’s complicity in this coverup 
raises serious questions about the orga-
nization’s ability or even their willing-
ness to protect our athletes. 
Today, we are calling on the PRC to 
provide 
independent 
and 
verifiable 
proof of Peng’s whereabouts and that 
she is safe and to allow Peng to com-
municate directly with the WTA and 
the United Nations. 
The IOC must call on the PRC to un-
dertake these actions immediately, 
stop legitimizing Beijing’s coverup, 
and uphold its own human rights com-
mitments to protect the safety and 
speech of Olympic athletes. The world 
is watching. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, when international in-
stitutions become unaccountable to 
the democratic world and are co-opted 
by dictators, they undermine American 
interests and values. That has become 
even clearer over the last few years. 
When the COVID–19 outbreak began 
in Wuhan, the World Health Organiza-
tion’s complicity and the CCP’s cover-
up helped turn what could have been a 
local outbreak into a global pandemic. 
We are still feeling the effects of the 
WHO repeating the CCP’s lies without 
scrutiny, with them covering for Xi 
Jinping and with them legitimizing 
sham investigations into the origina-
tion of the virus. 
The 
International 
Olympic 
Com-
mittee has a similar track record to-
ward the CCP’s human rights abuses. 
No human rights conditions were ever 
imposed by the IOC as a condition for 
China to host the 2008 Summer Olym-
pics, and the CCP used it as propa-
ganda to whitewash their brutal op-
pression. They allowed Beijing to host 
the 2022 Winter Olympics, once again 
turning a blind eye to the gross human 
rights violations and genocide cur-
rently being committed. 
Over the last several weeks, we have 
seen the IOC change from passively 
validating the CCP’s abuses to actively 
enabling them. The most troubling ex-
ample is the ongoing abuse of Chinese 
Olympian Peng Shuai. She was dis-
appeared by the CCP after coming for-
ward with serious sexual abuse allega-
tions against a senior party member. 
After the world began speaking up 
for Peng, the CCP propaganda machine 
published 
false 
statements 
in 
her 
name. Rather than standing up for her, 
the IOC immediately issued public 
statements to validate this obvious 
disinformation and propaganda. 
Even more shocking, IOC president, 
Thomas Bach, participated in and pub-
licized a staged conversation with Peng

that was supervised by a senior CCP 
member. 
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Peng is 
neither free nor safe. Since the 2008 
games, the Chinese Communist Party 
has become more repressive at home, 
more aggressive abroad, and has begun 
a genocide against China’s most vul-
nerable minorities. 
When Olympians from all over the 
world travel to Beijing in February, 
they are trusting the IOC to keep them 
safe, but the IOC’s recent actions have 
shown that they are not worthy of this 
trust. I commend this resolution for 
holding them accountable. 
In closing, I want to offer a heartfelt 
thanks to the Women’s Tennis Associa-
tion and its chairman, Steve Simon. 
Mr. Simon and the WTA have fought 
for Peng bravely in an inspiring display 
of moral clarity and support for our 
democratic values. Unfortunately, this 
is all too rare among those with finan-
cial ties to the CCP. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this measure, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
H. Res. 837, expressing the sense of 
the House of Representatives that Bei-
jing should immediately guarantee the 
safety and freedom of tennis star Peng 
Shuai is a timely and urgent resolu-
tion. 
Peng’s whereabouts and safety in 
China have been in question now for 
several weeks, and in just over 8 weeks, 
the Beijing Olympic Games are set to 
begin. There will be athletes from all 
over the world in attendance. This 
body owes it not to just to Peng, but to 
all the athletes participating in the 
Olympic Games to demonstrate that 
we do not take their safety and free-
dom for granted. 
The PRC must understand that its 
diplomatic and economic heft will not 
allow it to get away scot-free when it 
silences and erases individuals. 
While this resolution is about a sin-
gle athlete, it is really about the in-
nate dignity and freedom of every sex-
ual assault survivor, human rights ac-
tivist, environmental advocate, artist, 
journalist, and entrepreneur that has 
ever been beaten and broken by the 
Chinese Communist Party. We owe 
them our voice and our support. 
Let me, again, thank Congresswoman 
WEXTON and Congressman WALTZ for 
their work on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues will join us in supporting this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 837, as amended.

Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, on that I

CONDEMNING THE ONGOING GENO-
CIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HU-
MANITY BEING COMMITTED BY 
THE 
PEOPLE’S 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
CHINA 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 317) condemning the on-
going genocide and crimes against hu-
manity 
being 
committed 
against 
Uyghurs and members of other reli-
gious and ethnic minority groups by 
the People’s Republic of China, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 317 
Whereas, on December 9, 1948, the United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
unanimously 
adopted the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
(the Genocide Convention) signifying a com-
mitment in response to the Holocaust and 
other crimes against humanity committed in 
the first half of the twentieth century; 
Whereas the Genocide Convention entered 
into force on January 12, 1951, and declares 
that all state parties ‘‘confirm that geno-
cide, whether committed in time of peace or 
in time of war, is a crime under inter-
national law which they undertake to pre-
vent and to punish’’; 
Whereas the Genocide Convention defines 
genocide as ‘‘any of the following acts com-
mitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in 
part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious 
group, as such: (a) Killing members of the 
group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental 
harm to members of the group; (c) Delib-
erately inflicting on the group conditions of 
life calculated to bring about its physical de-
struction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing 
measures intended to prevent births within 
the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children 
of the group to another group’’; 
Whereas the United States ratified the 
Genocide Convention with the understanding 
that the commission of genocide requires 
‘‘the specific intent to destroy, in whole or 
in substantial part, a [protected] group as 
such’’; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC) is a state party to the Genocide Con-
vention; 
Whereas, since 2017, the PRC Government, 
under the direction and control of the Chi-
nese Communist Party (CCP), has detained 
and sought to indoctrinate more than one 
million Uyghurs and members of other eth-
nic and religious minority groups; 
Whereas recent data indicate a significant 
drop in birth rates among Uyghurs due to en-
forced sterilization, enforced abortion, and 
more onerous birth quotas for Uyghurs com-
pared to Han; 
Whereas there are credible reports of PRC 
Government campaigns to promote mar-
riages between Uyghurs and Han and to re-
duce birth rates among Uyghurs and other 
Turkic Muslims; 
Whereas many Uyghurs reportedly have 
been assigned to factory employment under 
conditions that indicate forced labor, and 
some former detainees have reported food 
deprivation, beatings, suppression of reli-
gious practices, family separation, and sex-
ual abuse; 
Whereas this is indicative of a systematic 
effort to eradicate the ethnic and cultural 
identity and religious beliefs, and prevent 
the births of, Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and 
Kyrgyz, and members of religious minority 
groups; 
Whereas the birth rate in the Xinjiang re-
gion fell by 24 percent in 2019 compared to a 
4.2 percent decline nationwide; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Depart-
ment of State determined the PRC Govern-
ment, under the direction and control of the 
CCP, has committed crimes against human-
ity and genocide against Uyghurs and other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang; 
Whereas 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony 
Blinken and Former Secretary of State Mi-
chael Pompeo have both stated that what 
has taken place in Xinjiang is genocide and 
constitutes crimes against humanity; 
Whereas Article VIII of the Genocide Con-
vention provides, ‘‘Any Contracting Party 
may call upon the competent organs of the 
United Nations to take such action under 
the Charter of the United Nations as they 
consider appropriate for the prevention and 
suppression of acts of genocide’’; 
Whereas the International Court of Justice 
has stated that it is the obligation of all 
state parties to the Genocide Convention to 
‘‘employ all means reasonably available to 
them, so as to prevent genocide so far as pos-
sible’’; and 
Whereas the United States is a Permanent 
Member of the United Nations Security 
Council: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) finds that the ongoing abuses against 
Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and re-
ligious minority groups constitute genocide 
as defined in the Genocide Convention and 
crimes against humanity as understood 
under customary international law; 
(2) attributes these atrocity crimes against 
Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and re-
ligious minority groups to the People’s Re-
public of China, under the direction and con-
trol of the Chinese Communist Party; 
(3) condemns this genocide and these 
crimes against humanity in the strongest 
terms; and 
(4) calls upon the President to direct the 
United States Permanent Representative to 
the United Nations to use the voice, vote, 
and influence of the United States to— 
(A) refer the People’s Republic of China’s 
genocide 
and 
crimes 
against 
humanity 
against Uyghurs and members of other eth-
nic and religious minority groups to the 
competent organs of the United Nations for 
investigation; 
(B) seize the United Nations Security 
Council of the circumstances of this geno-
cide and crimes against humanity and lead 
efforts to invoke multilateral sanctions in 
response to these ongoing atrocities; and 
(C) take all possible actions to bring this 
genocide and these crimes against humanity 
to an end and hold the perpetrators of these 
atrocities accountable under international 
law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
317, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 317, as amended, condemning 
the 
ongoing 
genocide 
and 
crimes 
against humanity being committed 
against Uyghurs and members of other 
religious and ethnic minority groups 
by the People’s Republic of China. And 
I was proud to introduce this resolu-
tion alongside my good friend, Ranking 
Member MCCAUL, and working collec-
tively with him. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said previously, 
and I will say this again, as an African 
American who has faced the brunt end 
of injustice for no reason other than 
the color of my skin and watched my 
parents suffer, I am very sensitive to 
the deep wounds of intolerance and op-
pression that many minority popu-
lations endure across the globe. 
Again, as Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., famously said: ‘‘Injustice anywhere 
is a threat to justice everywhere’’ and 
‘‘I refuse to be silent,’’ another state-
ment of Dr. King because silence can be 
complicity. 
Dr. King called us all to be cham-
pions of human rights, not just here in 
the United States, but wherever human 
rights are under threat. 
And we have seen grave human rights 
abuses in China. In Xinjiang, the 
Uyghur people and other ethnic and re-
ligious minority groups are subjected 
to systematic human rights violations 
that amounts to a genocide and crimes 
against humanity as defined by the Ge-
neva Convention. 
The crimes taking place against 
Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities 
in Xinjiang are horrific in their scope 
and severity. And we know of these 
atrocities 
because 
many 
survivors 
began speaking out at great risk to 
their personal safety and that of their 
families. They provided firsthand ac-
counts confirming China’s targeted 
campaign of repression. Meanwhile, 
journalists, scholars, and activists who 
have tried to uncover what is hap-
pening have been targeted and ex-
pelled. 
The House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee has heard harrowing accounts 
from survivors of mass internment, 
forced labor, torture, political indoc-
trination, suppression of religious prac-
tices, family separation, sexual abuse, 
and other inhumane practices. 
During a hearing on May 6 of this 
year, survivor Tursunay Ziyawudun 
ended her testimony by imploring the 
members of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee and Congress to act. And 
we are here today to do just that. 
This resolution unequivocally de-
clares that a genocide is taking place 
in the Uyghur region. I agree with that 
declaration and so do many others 
around the world. 
This resolution is a clarion call, not 
just to every nation in the world, but 
to every person on this planet that the 
United States Congress will not remain 
silent, no matter how powerful the per-
petrator. 
We must continue to call out the 
government of the People’s Republic of 
China for these atrocities and others 
all over the world and have them take 
all possible actions to bring this geno-
cide and these crimes against human-
ity to an end. 
I say to the world, we are starting 
with China. We are going all over the 
world. Human rights are on the front 
burner in the United States House of 
Representatives and clearly on the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
This is an important resolution. I 
close by saying I support and am glad 
to work with the ranking member, Mr. 
MCCAUL. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this resolu-
tion. I urge my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me thank the chairman for 
bringing this measure with me here 
today. I also want to thank him for his 
passion on this issue. We talk about 
human rights, whether it was the Afri-
can Americans who were enslaved in 
this Nation to the Native-American In-
dians who were mistreated by this Na-
tion to the victims of the Holocaust 
where the Geneva Convention came out 
with the prevention and punishment of 
the crime of genocide and defined what 
genocide is after the atrocities of the 
concentration camps that were per-
petrated by the Nazis—a war that my 
father fought in and bombed Nazi Ger-
many, and I am proud for his service 
and the entire Greatest Generation. 
And it is clear, the language, it says: 
‘‘targeting members of an ethnic or re-
ligious minority group for death or se-
rious bodily and mental harm or tak-
ing steps designed to destroy such a 
group constitutes genocide.’’ That is 
precisely what the Chinese Communist 
Party has been doing. 
Since 2017, they have interned more 
than one million Uyghurs and members 
of other ethnic and religious minority 
groups in an effort to wipe out their 
culture, to wipe out their ability to 
carry down to other generations by 
sterilizing them. 
During their unjustified detainment, 
Uyghurs 
and 
ethnic 
Kazakhs 
and 
Kyrgyz and members of religious mi-
nority groups are forced to work in 
horrific conditions, they are deprived 
of food, and they are beaten. Their reli-
gious practices are suppressed. There 
are reports of families being separated 
and of sexual abuse, of forced steriliza-
tion, forced abortions, and even reports 
of killing to wipe them, quite simply, 
off the face of the Earth. 
It is horrific to imagine that this is 
happening in this day and time, in this 
time that we speak, in this age. Mr. 
Speaker, it is clearly a genocide under 
the Geneva Convention. 
These crimes are the moral test of 
our time and our generation. The world 
and certainly the Chinese Communist 
Party is watching. And that is why it 
is vital that we speak in a united voice 
with the current and prior administra-
tions by calling these ongoing atroc-
ities what they are, and that is geno-
cide. 
Genocide is not to be taken lightly. 
It is a term we reserve for history’s 
most serious crimes against humanity. 
It is essential we get our response 
right, not as Republicans or Demo-
crats, but as Americans, as freedom- 
loving Americans who stand up for 
human rights and against genocide. Be-
cause we have faced this test before, 
and we have not always passed. 
Our response to the Uyghur genocide 
should be an example of our character 
in this Congress, rather than a stain on 
our history. 
This humanitarian crisis is about 
more than just U.S. foreign policy to-
ward the People’s Republic of China. It 
is about the legitimacy of the post- 
World War system designed to stop 
these atrocities whenever and wherever 
they are being committed. 
And it is about how we stop the CCP 
from contaminating consumer supply 
chains with slave labor. It is about how 
we stop using cotton sourced by the 
Uyghur homeland and picked by those 
without a voice. It is about stopping 
shipments of hair. It is about how we 
convince our private sector to act mor-
ally, consistent with our American val-
ues. 
So let me just say, I, again, thank 
the chairman. This is probably one of 
the most important bills to come out 
of the committee this year. I am proud 
to have introduced it, and I am so 
proud to have the chairman’s support. 
I thank him for cosponsoring this reso-
lution and all of our colleagues on the 
committee who support our efforts to 
condemn these atrocities. 
I urge the entire House of Represent-
atives on this vote, because China is 
watching and the Uyghur Muslims are 
watching, to join us as we speak in a 
united voice and condemn this geno-
cide by supporting this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1445 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL: Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT), ranking member of the 
Committee of Foreign Affairs’ Sub-
committee on Asia, the Pacific, and 
Nonproliferation. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 317, legislation which condemns 
China’s genocide against the Uyghurs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7509 
December 8, 2021 
As ranking member of the Committee 
of Foreign Affairs’ Subcommittee on 
Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, 
I strongly support this legislation and 
I commend both the chairman of the 
committee, Mr. MEEKS, and the rank-
ing member, Mr. MCCAUL, for their 
leadership on this particular issue. 
They have been stressing this. They 
have been pushing this. They have been 
speaking out on this for quite some 
time now, and I am very pleased to see 
this come before the floor today. It is 
far beyond the time that action needs 
to be taken on this. 
Mr. Speaker, the consistent under-
mining of human rights, perhaps the 
Chinese Communist Party’s most fun-
damental challenge to the free world. 
China’s totalitarian government, they 
have no use for human rights. Their 
bloody history demonstrates that. Rel-
ative to political freedom in China, one 
sees abuses from Tiananmen Square to 
Hong Kong. Freedom of speech? The 
great firewall shuts that down. Free-
dom of religion? The CCP, the Chinese 
Communist Party, persecutes Chris-
tians; they persecute the Falun Gong; 
they persecute Tibetan Buddhists; and 
they even want to dictate who the next 
Dalai Lama will be. 
And the Chinese Communist Party 
has taken this campaign to a whole 
new 
level 
in 
Xinjiang 
where 
the 
Uyghurs are subject to forced labor, to 
torture, to sexual abuse, to religious 
persecution, and to onerous restric-
tions in every facet of their lives. 
Over a million people, the vast ma-
jority of them Uyghurs, are in con-
centration 
camps 
today 
currently. 
While we are here, they are in con-
centration camps in China. The hall-
mark of genocide is the intent to de-
stroy, to eliminate an entire people, 
and that intent is clear here. The Chi-
nese Communist Party is snatching 
Uyghur children from their parents, 
imposing 
severe 
birth 
quotas 
on 
Uyghurs. They are conducting forced 
abortions. They are sterilizing a sizable 
percentage of the population against 
their will, and up to 80 percent in some 
areas of Xinjiang forced sterilization is 
occurring right now. 
As a result of all this, the birth rate 
in Xinjiang fell by 24 percent—one out 
of four—in 2019 alone. This is genocide, 
and it is high time that the world got 
serious with the PRC, the People’s Re-
public of China, about what they are 
doing to the Uyghurs. They have been 
doing it to a whole range of groups for 
a long time, but it is particularly bru-
tal when it comes to the Uyghurs, and 
American businesses have to make sure 
that they are not profiting by this es-
sentially slave labor, whatever busi-
nesses those are. 
So there are things that we can do 
here in the United States but, ulti-
mately, it is up to the PRC and it is up 
to the world to shine a light on this be-
cause this is happening right now. A 
million people or so are in these gulags 
right now. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank our lead-
ership, and this is bipartisan leader-
ship. It is Republicans and Democrats 
actually working together on this, and 
it is good to see that happen. 
So again, I thank Mr. MEEKS and Mr. 
MCCAUL for doing this. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say in closing, I 
again thank Chairman MEEKS, my 
friend, who has been in strong support 
of this legislation. We pride our com-
mittee in doing what is right by the 
country. We try to take the politics 
out of it as much as we can. And as 
Eliot Engel often said, it stops at the 
water’s edge, and this is no exception. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. 
Congress is rarely in vote or declared 
genocide on another people, but it is 
very appropriate today to do so. And 
the international community is watch-
ing, and China is watching this right 
now. They are watching this on C– 
SPAN, and the world knows that the 
United States stands for higher moral 
values, and we stand for human rights. 
And that is why this bill was intro-
duced, and the lives of over a million 
people depend on it. Think about that. 
A million people in internment camps, 
concentration 
camps, 
being 
exterminated, depend on this legisla-
tion. We pass a lot of things in this 
Congress but it is very rare you can 
pass something like this that con-
demns this kind of moral atrocity and 
call it to the world so the entire world 
can see it for themselves what is, in 
fact, happening. And when Congress 
speaks, the world does listen. And 
when we speak as Americans in this 
Chamber, not as partisan politicians, 
they listen. And I know they are listen-
ing today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank Mr. 
MCCAUL for his leadership. It is my 
pleasure to work with him on this bill 
to get this to the floor and to pass it on 
this floor, the people’s House, in a bi-
partisan way, sending a strong message 
together. That is what this does. So I 
thank him for his friendship, and I 
thank him for standing up, as he does, 
and working together in a bipartisan 
way. 
Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 317, condemning 
the 
ongoing 
genocide 
and 
crimes 
against humanity being committed 
against the Uyghurs and members of 
other religious and ethnic minority 
groups by the People’s Republic of 
China is critical to demonstrating to 
those suffering in Xinjiang that they 
haven’t been forsaken. And to the gov-
ernment of Beijing, we will speak out 
when it tramples the universal rights 
that every human being deserves. 
It gives me hope that we are not the 
first parliamentary body that has 
deemed the PRC’s action in Xinjiang a 
genocide. The parliaments of the U.K., 
of Canada, of Lithuania, among others, 
have already taken the right stand. We 
must support them. We must work 
with them and multilateral groups. We 
must encourage other nations and 
other people to speak out. But I am 
proud we are speaking out here today 
in the United States Congress, in the 
people’s House. We will not be silent. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that all my col-
leagues will join me in supporting this 
resolution, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
shed light on the horrific genocide that Com-
munist China is committing against Uyghurs 
and other ethnic and religious minorities. 
Right now, over one million Uyghurs are 
enslaved by the People’s Republic of China in 
the Xinjiang region, where they are subjected 
to horrific human rights atrocities like forced 
sterilization and abortions, slave labor, and 
even execution. 
Communist China is actively attempting to 
wipe out an entire people group, and the 
United States must not allow it. 
A few months ago, I—and other members of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee—heard directly 
from Ms. Tursunay Ziyawudun, a survivor of a 
CCP’s concentration camp. She told us 
harrowing stories of the horrific atrocities she 
suffered through. 
It was absolutely heartbreaking. I cannot 
imagine my wife or daughters being subjected 
to an environment like that. 
Today’s resolution sends the message di-
rectly from the United States to the Chinese 
government, that they must immediately end 
their ongoing crimes. 
I applaud Republican Leader MCCAUL and 
Chairman MEEKS for their work to address this 
heartbreaking atrocity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 317, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
ACCELERATING ACCESS TO CRIT-
ICAL THERAPIES FOR ALS ACT

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Accelerating 
Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. GRANTS FOR RESEARCH ON THERAPIES 
FOR ALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Health and 
Human Services (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall award grants to partici-
pating entities for purposes of scientific research 
utilizing data from expanded access to inves-
tigational drugs for individuals who are not 
otherwise eligible for clinical trials for the pre-
vention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or 
cure of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the case 
of a participating entity seeking such a grant, 
an expanded access request must be submitted, 
and allowed to proceed by the Secretary, under 
section 561 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb) and part 312 of title 
21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any suc-
cessor regulations), before the application for 
such grant is submitted. 
(b) APPLICATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—A participating entity seek-
ing a grant under this section shall submit to 
the Secretary an application at such time, in 
such manner, and containing such information 
as the Secretary shall specify.

of how data generated through an expanded ac-
cess request under section 561 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb) 
with respect to the investigational drug involved 
will be used to support research or development 
related to the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, 
treatment, or cure of amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis. 
(3) NONINTERFERENCE WITH CLINICAL TRIALS.— 
An application submitted under paragraph (1) 
shall include a description of how the proposed 
expanded access program will be designed so as 
not to interfere with patient enrollment in ongo-
ing clinical trials for investigational therapies 
for the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treat-
ment, or cure of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
(c) SELECTION.—Consistent with sections 406 
and 492 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 284a, 289a), the Secretary shall, in deter-
mining whether to award a grant under this sec-
tion, confirm that— 
(1) such grant will be used to support a sci-
entific research objective relating to the preven-
tion, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (as described in 
subsection (a)); 
(2) such grant shall not have the effect of di-
minishing eligibility for, or impeding enrollment 
of, ongoing clinical trials for the prevention, di-
agnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by determining 
that individuals who receive expanded access to 
investigational drugs through such a grant are 
not eligible for enrollment in— 
(A) ongoing clinical trials that are registered 
on ClinicalTrials.gov (or successor website), 
with respect to a drug for the prevention, diag-
nosis, 
mitigation, 
treatment, 
or 
cure 
of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; or 
(B) clinical trials for the prevention, diag-
nosis, 
mitigation, 
treatment, 
or 
cure 
of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for which an ex-
emption under section 505(i) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) 
has been granted by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration and which are expected to begin enroll-
ment within one year; and 
(3) the resulting project funded by such grant 
will allow for equitable access to investigational 
drugs by minority and underserved populations. 
(d) USE
OF FUNDS.—A participating entity 
shall use funds received through the grant— 
(1) to pay the manufacturer or sponsor for the 
direct costs of the investigational drug, as au-
thorized under section 312.8(d) of title 21, Code 
of Federal Regulations (or successor regula-
tions), to prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, or 
cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that is the 
subject of an expanded access request described 
in subsection (a), if such costs are justified as 
part of peer review of the grant; 
(2) for the entity’s direct costs incurred in pro-
viding such drug consistent with the research 
mission of the grant; or 
(3) for the direct and indirect costs of the enti-
ty in conducting research with respect to such 
drug.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
For purposes of carrying out this Act, there 
are authorized to be appropriated $100,000,000 
for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3537. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in July, the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce held a hear-
ing to learn about the challenges asso-
ciated with finding treatments for 
neurodegenerative diseases, including 
ALS. 
We heard from the lead scientist 
from the National Institutes of Health 
and the Food and Drug Administration, 
and researchers at top universities, 
who discussed the difficulties scientists 
have had in understanding the com-
plexities of the disease and developing 
biomarkers, a critical tool for drug de-
velopment. 
FDA told us about the guidance they 
had provided to the industry on ensur-
ing clinical trials were inclusive, and 
the agency’s willingness to consider 
novel clinical research methods. How-
ever, we also heard from patients who 
said that FDA’s guidance was not doing 
enough to get results on the ground. 
Given the length of time it often 
takes to diagnose ALS, many patients 
have found themselves locked out of 
clinical trials, despite the guidance 
urging developers to allow more flexi-
ble enrollment. 
As a result, patients and their fami-
lies are left to fight this devastating 
disease with very limited medical 
interventions. According to the patient 
advocates, FDA’s guidance was not 
being implemented by developers and 
was not being followed by the agency 
itself. So H.R. 3537, the Accelerating 
Access to Critical Therapies for ALS 
Act, takes real steps to improve proc-
esses and activities at FDA to ensure 
patients can access clinical trials. 
This legislation will help us get clos-
er to effective cures and treatments for 
ALS. It requires FDA to develop and 
carry out an action plan to show how 
the agency will address ALS and other 
neurodegenerative diseases over the 
next 5 years. 
The bill also creates a new grant pro-
gram at FDA to cover research costs to 
characterize 
rare 
neurodegenerative 
diseases, identify molecular targets for 
the diseases, and increase efficiency 
and productivity of clinical trials. 
Additionally, the bill creates a new 
grant program at the Department of 
Health and Human Services that will 
help pay for investigational drugs to 
prevent, diagnose, mitigate, treat, or 
cure ALS in expanded access programs. 
Expanded access is an important path-
way for patients to receive experi-
mental treatments, which should only 
be used when clinical trials and other 
effective treatments are not available. 
Mr. Speaker, in committee, we en-
sured there would be a path forward for 
patients who are not able to partici-
pate in clinical research, but also clari-
fied the intent and parameters of the 
program to maintain the scientific in-
tegrity of our research agencies. 
The legislation now requires the Gov-
ernment 
Accountability 
Office 
to 
measure the program ahead of a 5-year 
sunset to ensure that these novel grant 
programs are benefiting patients and 
researchers. The grants included in 
this bill are charting new territory for 
NIH, and it is important we measure 
their level of success before we explore 
efforts to expand this program beyond 
ALS. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill would not be 
here on the floor today were it not for 
the steadfast determination of patients 
and their families. At our hearing on 
this legislation in July, Brian Wallach 
and his wife, Sandra Abrevaya, co-
founders of ‘‘I Am ALS,’’ spoke so elo-
quently of their own personal fight 
against ALS, and charged us with the 
task of passing this bill. 
b 1500 
Hundreds of patient advocates across 
the country have made their voices 
heard to Members as well. To Brian, 
Sandra, and all the patients and their 
families, I reiterate what I said during 
our full committee markup: We heard 
you and now we are acting. We are 
grateful for your collaboration and 
willingness to work with us to improve 
this bill. 
I also want to acknowledge the work 
of Representative MIKE QUIGLEY, the 
sponsor of this legislation, who has 
been tireless in his efforts to see this 
legislation across the finish line. I ap-
preciate his willingness to work with 
us to get this bill to the committee so 
that it was ready for action here on the 
floor. I also want to thank our chair-
woman of the Health Subcommittee, 
Ms. ESHOO, for all that she has done to 
move this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the ACT for ALS, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3537, the Accelerating Access to 
Critical Therapies for ALS Act. 
I am a proud cosponsor of this bill 
and want to thank Representatives 
FORTENBERRY
and QUIGLEY
for their 
tireless efforts to move this bill for-
ward. We would not be here today with-
out your hard work and the tremen-
dous advocacy efforts of the ALS com-
munity, who have so passionately 
made the need for this legislation 
known to Congress. 
ALS 
is 
a 
devastating 
neurodegenerative disease that affects 
nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. 
Many people lose the ability to speak,

eat, move, and even breathe. Over 5,000 
people are diagnosed with this disease 
each year, and the average life expect-
ancy is only 2 to 5 years after diag-
nosis. 
Recent years have brought a wealth 
of new scientific understanding regard-
ing this disease. There are currently 
five drugs available to treat ALS, and 
while this is a remarkable achieve-
ment, we have more work ahead of us. 
H.R. 3537 establishes a grant program 
through HHS to support research and 
access to investigational therapies to 
treat ALS for those patients who can-
not access clinical trials. It also directs 
HHS to establish a public-private part-
nership for neurodegenerative diseases, 
which will advance the development 
and regulatory approval of drugs to 
help 
treat 
ALS 
and 
other 
rare 
neurodegenerative diseases. 
This bill will ring hope to those with 
ALS and their loved ones by promoting 
access 
to 
potentially breakthrough 
treatments and help us to one day find 
a cure for this vicious disease. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. QUIGLEY), the sponsor of the bill 
and the champion in the fight against 
ALS. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, every-
thing is impossible; until it isn’t. Noth-
ing has a cure; until it does. Today, 
people diagnosed with ALS are ex-
pected to live between 2 to 5 years. 
During that time, they progressively 
lose their ability to use their limbs, to 
speak, to swallow, and ultimately to 
breathe. Being diagnosed with ALS is a 
death sentence; for now. 
After my friend Brian Wallach was 
diagnosed with ALS an odds-defying 4 
years ago, he made ending the disease 
the fight of his life. Not today, ALS, he 
frequently says, not today. 
Mr. Speaker, ALS is not incurable; it 
is just that we have not fully com-
mitted to finding a cure yet. Not like 
Brian has, not like Brian’s wife Sandra 
has, or the organization they founded, 
I AM ALS has. 
ACT for ALS will give people living 
with ALS access to promising treat-
ments and improve the research infra-
structure we need to one day find the 
cure. Cruelly, up to 90 percent of people 
living with ALS are ineligible for clin-
ical trials. 
For people with such an aggressive 
disease to have neither an effective 
FDA-approached treatment nor access 
to promising drugs is a tragedy. ACT 
for ALS will correct this. 
I would like to thank the 331 col-
leagues who have cosponsored this bill, 
Chairman 
PALLONE, 
Subcommittee 
Chairwoman ESHOO, and their staffs, 
for standing with the ALS community. 
I also want to extend a special thank 
you to Congressman FORTENBERRY, the 
colead on this bill, who has pursued our 
shared goal with relentless dedication. 
I thank my staff, Allison Jarus and 
David Steury, who have gone above and 
beyond in pursuit of this legislation. 
This indeed is not a congressional 
achievement, it is an achievement of a 
community of advocates all around the 
country who are fighting for their 
lives, the lives of their loved ones, and 
the lives of everyone affected by ALS. 
In addition to Brian and I AM ALS, I 
want to thank the Muscular Dystrophy 
Association and the ALS Association 
for their dedication. ALS may rob peo-
ple of their physical ability to speak, 
but make no mistake, this community 
has made themselves heard. It is their 
will that has brought this vote to us 
today; it is their will, and with that 
will there is a way. 
Where there is consensus, there can 
be progress. Where there is funding, a 
cure will follow. Today belongs to the 
tireless advocates, to the families of 
people with ALS, and to every Amer-
ican living with the disease. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CURTIS). 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
share my support for expanding access 
for individuals to investigative drugs 
because I am concerned that we are not 
moving swiftly enough in order to pre-
vent diagnosis, mitigate, treat, or cure 
ALS. 
This is very personal to me, it is very 
personal to the committee. It hits ex-
tremely close to home for so many of 
us who have lost friends, and have seen 
good friends and neighbors struggle 
with their families with this difficult 
disease. 
I had the opportunity to speak about 
this earlier today in the Energy and 
Commerce Committee hearing on bio-
medical innovation. We are not moving 
fast enough and we have more work to 
do. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud this Accel-
erating Access to Critical Therapies for 
ALS Act for working to create and fur-
ther develop public-private partner-
ships and to prevent policies from 
being enacted that impede private sec-
tor investments and advancements. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewomen from Cali-
fornia (Ms. ESHOO), the chairwoman of 
the Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in the strongest support of this legisla-
tion, Accelerating Access to Critical 
Therapies for ALS. It is called the ACT 
for ALS. 
As chairwoman of the Health Sub-
committee, I am so proud to have ad-
vanced this legislation which enjoys 
331 bipartisan cosponsors, more than 
any other bill pending in the House. 
This legislation establishes grant pro-
grams 
to 
advance 
treatments 
for 
neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, 
allowing more patients to receive crit-
ical medicines through compassionate 
care programs. 
Jamie Berry, one of my constituents, 
wrote a poignant letter to me, and said 
the following: ‘‘With ALS, a piece of 
you dies every day. We are simply ask-
ing for a fighting chance to live the 
lives we were meant to live.’’ As we 
gather here to pass this bill, Jamie is a 
patient in the neuro ICU unit at Stan-
ford University Hospital. 
Jamie, if you are listening, stay 
tuned, because your wish is going to 
come true today. To you, Jamie, and 
all your fellow ALS patients, I am 
proud that the United States House of 
Representatives will vote for this legis-
lation to support your fighting chance 
against this deadly disease. 
This is a transformational bill to 
make sure that people with ALS are 
given treatment options, and some-
thing they all deserve—it is spelled H- 
O-P-E, hope. 
I salute Representatives QUIGLEY and 
FORTENBERRY, for the phenomenal job 
they have done on this legislation, 
both in introducing it and building it 
up to be the most cosponsored legisla-
tion in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support the bill, ACT for ALS. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the distinguished 
Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Kentucky (Mr. GUTH-
RIE) for yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to first associate 
myself with the remarks made by Ms. 
ESHOO of California, as well as Mr. PAL-
LONE, and stand up in strong support of 
this bill. I also thank the lead authors, 
Mr. FORTENBERRY
and Mr. QUIGLEY, 
and all of us who have worked on this 
and other issues to help patients with 
ALS. 
This goes back to other legislation 
that we have worked on, including the 
21st Century Cures Act, where Congress 
came together, Republicans and Demo-
crats, through the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, to help put a sharp-
er focus on finding cures for diseases 
like ALS, diseases like Alzheimer’s, 
and so many other debilitating diseases 
where you have got people that just 
want hope; as Ms. ESHOO said, where 
you have people who want the ability 
to live their lives to the fullest. 
I know I have worked on so many of 
these ALS-related issues with a hero 
back home in my district, Steve Glea-
son. Steve Gleason was, for awhile, 
more famous as a player for the New 
Orleans Saints, somebody who gave us 
a light in the darkness of Hurricane 
Katrina, but then Steve was diagnosed 
with ALS. He turned his notoriety into 
a call for action for other people with 
ALS to be able to live their lives to the 
fullest. 
Steve has been an inspiration to so 
many. He has a speech device that al-
lows him to communicate; and he stays 
incredibly active. Steve brought this 
bill up over a year ago. So this is one 
more thing that we can do to help peo-
ple with ALS; so that they can bring 
new therapies so that people living 
with ALS do have more ability to treat 
this disease.

December 8, 2021 
This means lifesaving drugs will now 
be available for individuals who are not 
otherwise able to get into ALS clinical 
trials. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of heroes, in-
spirational battlers like Steve Gleason, 
and so many of us have other heroes in 
our districts, I rise in strong support of 
this great piece of legislation that 
brings Republicans and Democrats to-
gether to take action for those people 
who are counting on us. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the chair-
woman of the Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Commerce. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and the chair of 
the Health Subcommittee for this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remem-
ber my friend Artie. Artie and I were 
friends from the time we were in third 
grade in Chicago, and we stayed in 
touch all the many, many years. I was 
pretty devastated when he told me that 
he had ALS. 
A couple of years ago Artie made the 
decision, because ALS is a really cruel 
disease, to take his own life, to set the 
date so that he would just make the de-
cision himself and not suffer so hor-
ribly to the bitter end, because at that 
time he saw no hope. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of 
my constituent, Brian Wallach and his 
wife, Sandra, who saw that there was 
hope in the future. They would fight in 
order to get legislation that would 
make access to what is promising 
therapies right now, therapies that 
weren’t available or even on the hori-
zon to Artie. 
I am so proud to join with colleagues 
across the aisle to say that we can pro-
vide that hope, that opportunity to 
people who are facing what has been a 
death sentence, and that we can see a 
future that is bright for now the ALS 
victims. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank I AM 
ALS, the organization, and many of 
the organizations that have been fight-
ing for this. The advocates have done a 
great job to bring this to our attention 
and bring this day about and get over 
300 cosponsors to this legislation. I am 
proud to be among them. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, as I 
mentioned, there are over 300 cospon-
sors, and we all know that is not an 
easy task to do at all. It takes a lot of 
work, a lot of leg work, a lot of effort. 
The two hardest working people that 
we have seen this session are Mr. 
QUIGLEY from Illinois, and my good 
friend JEFF
FORTENBERRY
from Ne-
braska, who put such effort into this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY). 
b 1515 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, BRETT GUTHRIE, for 
his kind and generous words. It is very 
meaningful. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the first books 
that I recall reading as a child was 
about the life of the famous New York 
Yankees first baseman named Lou 
Gehrig. He was nicknamed The Iron 
Horse due to his athletic ability and 
endurance. He could hit. He could run. 
He could field. He was an amazing ath-
lete. 
And 
then, 
everything 
just 
changed. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
stole that man’s abilities, causing him 
to lose control of basic functions. 
This merciless, cruel, and aggressive 
neurodegenerative condition mocked 
Lou Gehrig’s famous durability. The 
disease became known as Lou Gehrig’s 
disease, and today we call it ALS. 
Mr. Speaker, there was no cure then, 
and there is no cure now. 
Before he died in 1941, at a ceremony 
at home plate in Yankee Stadium, Lou 
Gehrig had this to say. He said: ‘‘For 
the past 2 weeks, you have been read-
ing about a bad break. Yet today, I 
consider myself the luckiest man on 
the face of the Earth.’’ 
That 
story, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Lou 
Gehrig’s story, stayed with me as a 
child. I don’t know why, but it did, and 
I remember it so well. 
Now, 
fast-forward 
decades 
later. 
While serving here as a Member of Con-
gress, this same cruel disease has swept 
upon my own family. 
I want to do this, Mr. Speaker, if you 
will indulge me. Pictured here is my 
wife, Celeste, with her little brother 
and godson, Joe Gregory. In his mid- 
thirties, Joe began to notice that his 
hand was shaking. He started a battery 
of tests, but somehow, he just knew it 
was probably going to be the worst of 
the worst. He was diagnosed with ALS, 
but he faced his plight with both dig-
nity and courage. He volunteered to be 
a part of an experimental trial. He 
said: Well, if it doesn’t work for me, 
maybe it will help someone else. 
He died when he was 37 years old, and 
he left behind Melanie, his wife, and 
four little children. On his tombstone 
are the words from the prophet Isaiah: 
‘‘Here I am; send me.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as Joe began to die, we 
as a family quickly learned about this 
profound trauma that affects so many 
families all across America. It happens 
over and over out of view. Most of us 
never see it. 
I soon became acquainted with this 
amazingly strong and determined ALS 
community. It was so uplifting to me 
to meet people filled with so much 
hope. You have heard that word over 
and over today, Mr. Speaker, and it is 
appropriate. So many people filled with 
so much hope amidst their own suf-
fering but who rightfully sought a dif-
ferent approach and a better way. 
Out of this experience was born the 
ACT for ALS. 
Mr. Speaker, for over 50 years now 
and over 50 clinical trials, ALS pa-
tients have submitted themselves to 
tests, trials, therapies, and placebos in 
accordance with the rules of the cur-
rent healthcare policy framework. But 
progress has been uneven, even debat-
able, with serious impediments to 
promising new treatments. Many have 
sacrificed their lives to science as they 
weakened and died. 
But today, here we are, Mr. Speaker, 
with over 330 cosponsors from both 
sides of the aisle, and we are standing 
for a new way. 
ACT for ALS represents a monu-
mental shift in the way in which we ap-
proach 
ALS 
and 
other 
neurodegenerative diseases. At the core 
of this bill, it does two things. It trans-
forms the paradigm of disease research 
and regulation, and it creates a new 
pathway for promising treatments. It 
drives 
the 
hope. 
With 
this 
groundbreaking law, we can break 
through faster for those who have suf-
fered so much. 
I want to publicly say thank you to 
Representative QUIGLEY for his tireless 
leadership in driving this hope, and my 
very 
close 
friends, 
Representatives 
ANNA
ESHOO
and CATHY
MCMORRIS 
RODGERS, for their leadership in shep-
herding this bill as well. It is truly bi-
partisan. It was not easy, but here we 
are on the precipice of doing something 
good for so many people. 
Mr. Speaker, I may be just a little bit 
like Lou Gehrig. I, too, am a lucky 
man, and for this reason: I have met so 
many beautiful people who have shared 
their sufferings, their vulnerability, 
and their gratitude toward this effort 
today. People of good heart, coura-
geous, and who are fighters have cre-
ated a family of solidarity to help us 
creatively rethink how to attack this 
disease through sound science, through 
technology, and through improved pub-
lic policy. 
Mr. Speaker, one last note: There are 
so many heroes who deserve special 
recognition, but you have heard one 
singled out today, and I want to single 
him out as well. This fight’s Iron Horse 
is my friend and founder of the organi-
zation I AM ALS, Brian Wallach. As 
Brian said in congressional testimony 
in July with his wife, Sandra, there: 
‘‘This is our argument for our lives.’’ 
Yes, it is, Brian. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I should say pub-
licly: Thank you, Brian; thank you, 
Joe; and thank you to the ALS commu-
nity. We could not be here without you 
today. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
didn’t mention a family as well. 
Mr. Speaker, when you first come to 
Washington, you start getting to know 
people who come to advocate for dis-
eases and treatments like this. I met 
the Ensor family. A lady named Kay 
Ensor came here with her 11- or 12- 
year-old daughter at the time, Shelby. 
Shelby came to my office and said: 
I can’t get a hug from my father anymore, 
and I don’t want any other little girl to feel 
this way. It may be too late for us, but I 
don’t want it to be too late for somebody in 
the future. 
I got to know them, and I visited 
them in Lebanon Junction, Kentucky.

Their son, Tanner, was probably 8 or 9 
at the time. They rigged up a wheel-
chair so he could go hunting with his 
father. But then it got to the point 
where they couldn’t do that at all. 
Then, unfortunately, I was able to at-
tend Mr. Ensor’s funeral. 
I don’t have personal experiences in 
my family, but just seeing the effort 
that a family has to go through and the 
love that they do it in was an example 
for me to get involved in this issue, and 
the suffering that the patient goes 
through but also the extremely dif-
ficult circumstances for a family but 
how they were so loving in everything 
they did. 
I want to close with this: I know that 
Brian and his wife, Sandra, were there 
at the hearing and touched every one 
of us. I want to yield back in honor of 
the Ensor family from Lebanon Junc-
tion, Kentucky, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, after 
listening to the personal stories on 
both sides of the aisle, I don’t think 
anyone would question why this bill is 
important in order to provide hope to 
so many, as the speakers said, in order 
to try to find a cure and in order to try 
to find more treatments and clinical 
trials. All these are basically put into 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge unanimous 
support for this bill on both sides, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3537, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5487. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, stillbirth is one of the 
most devastating losses that affects 
more than 24,000 families each year. 
Stillbirth touches families of all races, 
religions, and socioeconomic status. 
For many parents, stillbirth is a loss 
that hits unexpectedly. In fact, up to 
half of all stillbirths occur in preg-
nancies that had seemed problem-free. 
However, miscarriages and stillbirths 
are not systematically recorded, even 
in developed countries, suggesting that 
the numbers could be even higher. 
While there has been some progress 
in reducing stillbirths, causes and risk 
factors have not been explored exten-
sively. 
H.R. 5487, the SHINE for Autumn Act 
of 2021, is an important first step in 
promoting positive change around this 
issue. The legislation is in honor of Au-
tumn Joy, who was born stillborn on 
July 8, 2011. For the last decade, her 
mother, Debbie Haine, has transformed 
her loss into action. 
The legislation seeks to bolster re-
search on stillbirths and stillbirth risk 
factors to lower our Nation’s stillbirth 
rate. H.R. 5487 would provide resources 
to State and Federal health depart-
ments, improve data collection around 
stillbirths, and increase education and 
awareness. 
Since a stillbirth is such a private, 
devastating life event, the data col-
lected is only intended for the purpose

of informing public health research and 
improving health outcomes. The re-
sources provided in the legislation to 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the National Institutes of 
Health, and State health departments 
to improve data collection and increase 
education and awareness is simply the 
beginning of a longer term solution to-
ward the prevention and reduction of 
incidences of stillbirth nationwide. 
I want to thank Representatives 
HERRERA
BEUTLER, 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
MULLIN, and CASTOR for their work on 
this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5487, the SHINE for Autumn 
Act of 2021, led by Representatives 
HERRERA
BEUTLER, 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
MULLIN, and CASTOR. 
Each year, about 24,000 babies are 
stillborn in the United States, accord-
ing to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. Despite medical inno-
vations, stillbirth rates remain rel-
atively unchanged and affect women of 
different ages and backgrounds. 
No family should have to go through 
such an unthinkable tragedy, and this 
is, unfortunately, far too common. 
H.R. 5487 aims to prevent stillbirth 
through enhanced research, surveil-
lance, and reporting. Specifically, the 
bill directs the Department of Health 
and Human Services to better support 
States in collecting more complete 
stillbirth data. It also establishes a Na-
tional Institutes of Health fellowship 
program focused on stillbirth research 
and pathology. 
This legislation will help provide 
much-needed outreach and education 
on stillbirths, giving healthcare pro-
viders additional tools to improve 
health outcomes for mothers and ba-
bies who deserve a fighting chance at 
life. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. CASTOR), who is a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and chair of the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chairman PALLONE for yielding 
me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, here in the United 
States, we continue to grapple with a 
maternal and infant health crisis. 
There are approximately 24,000 still-
births in the United States each year, 
and we rank 25th among 49 high-in-
come countries in stillbirth rates. 
There are longstanding and per-
sistent racial and ethnic disparities, 
with Black women experiencing still-
births at two times the rate of White 
women. 
b 1530 
So we need real change that will help 
lead to measurable improvements in 
health. That is why I was pleased to in-
troduce the Stillbirth Health Improve-
ment and Education for Autumn, or 
SHINE for Autumn Act, with my col-
leagues, 
Representatives 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER, ROYBAL-ALLARD, and MULLIN. 
Through the bill, we intend to im-
prove the research and data collection 
on stillbirths. We want to authorize 
grants for surveillance and data collec-
tion. We are going to develop guide-
lines and educational materials and 
create a fellowship at NIH to dive deep-
er into the research. 
The bill is named in honor of Autumn 
Joy, who was stillborn on July 8, 2011. 
Her mother, Debbie, turned this trag-
edy into advocacy. She spearheaded the 
effort to increase stillbirth awareness 
and education and lower stillbirth 
rates. And I am proud to help lead the 
legislation in Autumn’s memory. 
I want to thank Debbie for her perse-
verance on behalf of families across 
America. This heartbreaking loss can 
happen in any family, and there is so 
much we still do not know. So this new 
law, this bill, SHINE for Autumn Act, 
will help avoid a lot of the tragedy that 
Debbie, unfortunately, found with the 
death of her daughter, Autumn. 
So I ask my colleagues to support the 
SHINE for Autumn Act. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD), the prime Democratic 
sponsor of the bill and the chairwoman 
of the Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Homeland Security. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 5487, the Still-
birth Health Improvement and Edu-
cation for Autumn Act, or the SHINE 
Act. 
For far too long, stillbirth has ex-
isted in the shadows of our maternity 
care system. Yet, each year, in the 
United States, about 24,000 babies are 
stillborn. This is more than 10 times as 
many deaths that occur from Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome, yet SIDS is 
much more recognized and researched 
than stillbirth. 
Due to our failure to invest in still-
birth research, the United States lags 
behind 181 nations who are more rap-
idly reducing their stillbirth rates than 
us. And similar to most adverse mater-
nal and infant outcomes, our minority 
communities 
are 
disproportionately 
impacted by this heartbreak. 
Also, families who experience a still-
birth tragedy are not well-supported by 
our healthcare system or their commu-
nities. This leaves families feeling iso-
lated and unprepared to deal with their 
tragic loss. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Ma-
ternity Care Caucus, I am proud to 
have worked with my co-chair and au-
thor of the bill, Congresswoman JAIME 
HERRERA BEUTLER, and my colleagues, 
Congresswoman KATHY
CASTOR
and 
Congressman MARKWAYNE MULLIN, to 
introduce the SHINE for Autumn Act 
this fall. 
And I thank Debbie Haine for sharing 
her family’s story of losing Autumn, 
and for her decade-long crusade to 
shine a Federal spotlight on this heart-
breaking maternal health concern. 
The SHINE Act will establish a 
Perinatal Pathology Fellowship pro-
gram at the NIH to increase research 
on stillbirth. It will provide critical re-
sources to Federal and State health de-
partments to improve surveillance and 
data collection. And it will increase 
awareness and understanding of this 
perinatal tragedy by supporting the de-
velopment of educational materials 
and guidelines for State and local 
health departments. 
The SHINE Act also directs the Sur-
geon General to produce a report on 
stillbirth risk factors and requires the 
Secretary of HHS to report on the 
progress and effectiveness of the NIH 
training programs. 
Today, this House has the oppor-
tunity to bring stillbirth out of the 
shadows and to invest in the education 
and research that will save babies 
lives. 
I am proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the 
SHINE for Autumn Act, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this critical leg-
islation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
This is an important bill. I can’t 
imagine what Autumn’s mother has 
gone through; what so many families 
have gone through with the stillbirth 
of their child. I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote for this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this critical legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5561. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Over the last 20 years, we have been 
very successful in addressing one of the 
most common birth defects affecting 
America’s children, congenital hearing 
loss. Children with this condition are 
born with hearing loss and are at risk 
for delays in speech, language, social, 
and emotional development. Fortu-
nately, early detection and interven-
tion is highly effective in preventing 
these adverse effects. 
Since the year 2000, Congress has 
passed and subsequently reauthorized 
Early Hearing Detection and Interven-
tion programs, also known as EHDI 
programs; and these programs support 
State and territory programs and sys-
tems of care to identify and support 
children who are deaf or hard of hear-
ing. As a result of these EHDI pro-
grams, early hearing loss screening, di-
agnosis, and treatment services have 
greatly increased over the last 20 
years. 
Consider that before 1993, only 1 in 10 
newborns were screened for hearing 
loss. Recent data indicates that today, 
97 percent of all infants are screened 
within the first month of their lives; 77 
percent of infants receive audiological 
evaluations and diagnosis by 3 months 
of age; and 70 percent of infants were 
enrolled in early intervention services 
before 6 months of age. These are re-
markable achievements that help en-
sure all children with hearing loss have 
the same opportunities as children who 
can hear. 
So today, we are considering a bill 
that will help us build on these 
achievements. H.R. 5561, the Early 
Hearing Detection and Intervention 
Act of 2021, would extend funding for 
the EHDI programs for 5 years through 
fiscal year 2026. This legislation will 
ensure that these services continue to 
be available for children that are deaf 
or hard of hearing. 
I want to commend our Health Sub-
committee Ranking Member GUTHRIE 
for his leadership on this bill. I urge all 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 5561, the Early Hearing 
Detection and Intervention Act, which 
is also co-led by my Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee 
colleague, 
Rep-
resentative MATSUI. 
Hearing loss in children continues to 
be all too prevalent in the United 
States. According to recent Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention data, 
almost 15 percent of children ages six 
to 19 experience either low or high-fre-
quency hearing loss in one or both 
ears. 
The Early Hearing Detection and 
Intervention 
program, 
administered 
through CDC and the Health Resources 
and Services Agency, has helped pro-
viders to quickly identify babies and 
young children who are born deaf or 
hard of hearing, which has led to im-
proved health outcomes and brought 
hope to so many families. 
H.R. 5561 reauthorizes Federal sup-
port for these important statewide pro-
grams that promote early detection, 
diagnosis, and treatment of deaf and 
hearing impaired newborns, infants, 
and young children through 2026. 
My bill will redouble our efforts to 
truly open the world of communication 
to children experiencing hearing loss. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this bill on a bipartisan 
basis, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

SEC. 3. EFFECTS OF FOLIC ACID IN PREVENTION 
OF BIRTH DEFECTS. 
Section 317J of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247b–11) is amended by striking sub-
section (e) (relating to authorization of appro-
priations). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5551. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 5551, the Im-
proving the Health of Children Act, 
which reauthorizes the National Center 
on Birth Defects and Developmental 
Disabilities. This center was estab-
lished by Congress in 2000 to improve 
the health of millions of our Nation’s 
most vulnerable citizens, our infants 
and children, people with disabilities, 
and people with blood disorders. It is 
the only center at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention whose 
mission focuses on these populations. 
Birth defects, Mr. Speaker, affect 1 in 
33 babies and are a leading cause of in-
fant death in the United States. Chil-
dren with birth defects who survive 
often experience lifelong physical and 
mental disabilities. In addition, over 
500,000 children are diagnosed with a 
developmental disability each year. 
Blood disorders such as sickle cell 
disease, anemia, and hemophilia, affect 
millions of people each year in the 
United 
States, 
cutting 
across 
the 
boundaries of age, race, sex, and socio-
economic status. 
So H.R. 5551, sponsored by Represent-
atives CARTER and TRAHAN, reauthor-
izes the work of this center for 5 years 
and helps maintain the programmatic 
focus of the center. 
It has been 15 years since the last au-
thorization, and the importance of the 
center’s 
work 
continues 
to 
grow. 
Whether it be supporting partnerships 
to continue research on autism or co-
ordinating a rapid response to Zika, 
the center plays a critical role in pre-
venting birth defects and helping peo-
ple with disabilities and blood dis-
orders live healthy and productive 
lives. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill so that we 
can ensure vital surveillance and re-
search continue to focus on the well- 
being of people with birth defects, dis-
abilities, and blood disorders. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5551, the Improving the Health 
of Children Act, led by my Energy and 
Commerce Committee colleagues, Rep-
resentatives CARTER and TRAHAN. 
Birth defects, unfortunately, are very 
common in the United States. Accord-
ing to recent Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention data, 1 in every 33 
babies are born with a birth defect each 
year, and birth defects are the leading 
cause of death for all babies. 
H.R. 5551 reauthorizes through 2026 
the National Center on Birth Defects 
and Developmental Disabilities, which 
has been critical to improving the lives 
of children with birth defects and their 
families. 
This would reestablish critical pro-
gramming related to birth defects, in-
tellectual disabilities, and child devel-
opment in order to bolster the center’s 
research efforts and improve more 
lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN), a member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and the Democratic sponsor of this bill. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5551, the Improv-
ing the Lives of Children Act. I spon-
sored this bipartisan legislation along-
side Representatives BUDDY CARTER, G. 
K. BUTTERFIELD, and HENRY CUELLAR, 
because the work being done at the 
CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects 
and Developmental Disabilities is tre-
mendously important to many millions 
of families across our Nation. 
Approximately 1 in 6 children in the 
United States are affected by some 
form of developmental disability. They 
include a diverse range of conditions, 
including ADHD, autism spectrum dis-
order, 
fragile 
X 
syndrome, 
and 
Tourette syndrome, just to name a few. 
Some of these conditions have the 
ability to seriously impact children’s 
lives by limiting motor ability, cog-
nitive development, verbal communica-
tion, and behavioral development, and 
they often last throughout a person’s 
lifetime 
For some developmental disabilities, 
we know the causes and the risk fac-
tors, but for so many others, we don’t. 
That is why the research and advance-
ments at the National Center on Birth 
Defects and Developmental Disabilities 
continue to be so crucial. 
Since its creation in 2000, the cen-
ter’s dedicated staff have created a 
roadmap to a world where babies are 
born healthy, children are empowered 
to reach their full potential, and fami-
lies are able to thrive. But there is still 
so much work to be done. 
That is why my legislation reauthor-
izes the center for the first time in 15 
years and provides it with the funding 
and resources necessary to support 
more than a dozen essential programs. 
This bipartisan bill is key to identi-
fying developmental disabilities early 
and bolstering doctors’ capacity to in-
tervene, both of which experts agree 
are critical in improving children’s 
ability to learn new skills and reducing 
the financial burden on families. 
Mr. Speaker, when children and 
adults with disabilities receive the care 
and services they need, their quality of 
life improves dramatically. 
The goal of the National Center on 
Birth Defects and Developmental Dis-
abilities is to ensure that every person 
with a disability has access to the sup-
port they need from a young age, and 
our legislation helps achieve it. 
That is why it is supported by so 
many individuals and families across 
America who want nothing more than 
for Congress to advance policies that 
give people living with disabilities the 
dignity, 
respect, 
and 
opportunities 
they need to succeed. 
I look forward to casting my vote in 
favor of this legislation, and I encour-
age all of my colleagues to join me in 
doing the same. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the chairman and ranking 
member for bringing this important 
legislation to the floor. The Improving 
the Health for Children Act is up for 
vote today. It is an extremely impor-
tant bill. 
As we all know, the National Center 
on Birth Defects and Developmental 
Disabilities does phenomenal work to 
protect, prevent, and research birth de-
fects and intellectual disabilities for a 
wide range of conditions. 
They also provide much needed edu-
cational resources to parents and care-
givers about the conditions a child may 
have, and they work to raise awareness 
about conditions that may be hard to 
identify. 
Unfortunately, the center has been 
operating under an expired authoriza-
tion since 2007. We must not forgo our 
commitment to these children. 
This legislation reaffirms congres-
sional support of the center, expands 
their scope to study more conditions, 
and provides an increase, per author-
ization, so that they can continue to 
carry out the great work they do. 
I want to thank the bipartisan sup-
porters of this legislation for the help 
in authoring this bill, Representatives 
TRAHAN, CUELLAR, BUTTERFIELD, and 
HUDSON, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
passage of this important legislation 
today. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage my colleagues to vote for this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support on a bipartisan basis, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1193. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, valvular heart disease 
is a rising health threat to many other-
wise healthy people. Each year, more 
than 25,000 Americans lose their lives 
to valvular heart disease, and they are 
predominantly young women. Unfortu-
nately, the disease’s reach is only in-
creasing with more than 5 million diag-
noses each year. 
Despite this rising incidence, there is 
so much that we do not know about 
valvular heart disease. Specifically, we 
do not have a good understanding 
about what makes the disease life- 
threatening. 
Today, we are taking an important 
step to address this gap by considering 
H.R. 1193, the CAROL Act. I commend 
Representative BARR
for introducing 
this legacy bill in honor of his late 
wife, Carol, who died unexpectedly in 
June of 2020 from an underlying val-
vular heart disease condition. This bill 
will help other families avoid the same 
tragedy his family has faced. 
The CAROL Act will expand research 
on valvular heart disease and its treat-
ment by authorizing a grant program 
administered by the National Insti-
tutes of Health in collaboration with 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute. It will also require the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
to carry out projects to increase edu-
cation, awareness, and diagnosis of val-
vular heart disease and to reduce car-
diac deaths caused by valvular heart 
disease. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support 
of 
H.R. 
1193, 
the 
Cardio-
vascular Advances and Opportunities 
Legacy Act, or the CAROL Act, intro-
duced by my good friend and fellow 
Kentuckian, 
Representative 
ANDY 
BARR. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress is like a fam-
ily, and we certainly laugh together 
and we certainly argue with each 
other, but there are times we cry with 
each other. I will never forget the 
phone call that I received from ROBERT 
ADERHOLT telling me that Carol Barr, 
who was a wonderful woman, wonderful 
wife, and wonderful mother, had passed 
away. 
Our friend and colleague, Representa-
tive ANDY BARR, has introduced this 
bill to honor his wife, who passed away 
from mitral valve prolapse. 
Heart disease continues to be the 
leading cause of death for most demo-
graphic groups in the United States. 
Over 600,000 Americans die from heart 
disease each year. This is equal to one 
person every 36 seconds. 
We know that taking early action is 
critical to surviving a heart condition. 
People need to know the warning signs 
and symptoms. Understanding the gaps 
in education and information sharing 
will help the healthcare system better 
detect these warning signs. 
This bill authorizes grants adminis-
tered by the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute to support research on 
valvular heart disease and convenes 
subject matter experts to identify re-
search opportunities to develop more

informed treatment guidelines for pa-
tients with valvular heart disease. 
It also instructs the CDC to increase 
public awareness about the symptoms 
associated with valvular heart disease 
and effective strategies for preventing 
sudden cardiac arrest. 
This bill will provide timely invest-
ments to adequately inform others 
about valvular heart disease and ulti-
mately save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said, every 36 sec-
onds, one person dies from heart dis-
ease. It is a life; it is a wife; it is a 
mother; it is Carol Barr. That is who 
we are here today to honor. We should 
use the horrible tragedy that the Barrs 
have gone through to prevent other 
families from going through the same 
thing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Miss RICE), a member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of the CAROL 
Act, which I am proud to co-lead with 
my friend, Representative ANDY BARR, 
which will fund critical breakthroughs 
in our understanding of valvular heart 
disease. 
Millions of Americans live with some 
form of valvular heart disease, and 
most of them go their entire lives with-
out a serious issue or incident. But 
over 25,000 people die in this country 
from this condition every single year. 
Last year, ANDY’s wife, Carol, trag-
ically passed away from a heart valve 
condition called mitral valve prolapse. 
The CAROL Act will honor Carol’s 
life by creating a new grant program 
administered by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute to fund val-
vular heart disease research. 
Our hope is that this research will 
improve our knowledge of this poorly 
understood condition and one day 
produce a cure that will prevent other 
families from having to endure the 
same tragedy that befell the Barr fam-
ily. I cannot think of a more beautiful 
tribute to Carol’s life than that. 
ANDY, I commend you and your fam-
ily for your incredible strength and for 
turning your grief into action. It was 
my honor to join you on this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE, Chairwoman ESHOO, Ranking 
Member RODGERS, and Ranking Mem-
ber GUTHRIE for bringing this critical 
bill to the floor. I urge all members to 
support it today. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I almost 
always enjoy when the Republican 
leader comes to Kentucky, whether it 
is going to see Corvettes or the Abra-
ham 
Lincoln 
birthplace. 
Unfortu-
nately, we got to spend time together 
honoring Carol when we attended her 
funeral in Lexington. 
I know he was a dear friend of Car-
ol’s. He is not just our Republican lead-
er, but he was a dear friend of hers as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), the Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend for yielding, and I 
want to thank him for his friendship 
and his work. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
legislation. I want to thank Congress-
man BARR for his leadership in bring-
ing this legislation to the floor in a 
strong bipartisan way. I am proud to 
support the CAROL Act in honor of 
ANDY’s lovely wife, the late Carol Barr. 
Like everyone who knew her, we 
know the moment and where we were 
when we heard of her passing. It was 
sudden. It was unexpected. It was 
something no one ever thought could 
happen. 
If you ever met her, you were her 
friend. She was a kind and graceful per-
son with a heart for service. As I speak 
today, I remember her laugh. 
Throughout 
her 
own 
career 
and 
working with ANDY, Carol devoted her 
time and energy to giving back to the 
community. She had a service heart. It 
was all about the Sixth District. 
I met her years ago. I met her when 
she first knew ANDY, before either 
daughter was born. I was able to watch 
them grow and watch the look in their 
mom’s eyes. 
I remember one time when we were 
there, she was holding Eleanor. Elea-
nor was showing me her parade wave. 
Carol led a highly respected career in 
sales at Pfizer. She served as executive 
director for the Henry Clay Center for 
Statesmanship; and she volunteered at 
the Junior League of Lexington and 
the University of Kentucky’s College of 
Communication and Information Na-
tional Advisory Board. 
b 1600 
Her faith, her patriotism, and her 
generosity toward her neighbors were 
manifest. For those who attended the 
time to honor her life, speaker after 
speaker after speaker could tell you 
the moment in time that Carol walked 
into their life. The interesting part 
when they told it, their life got better, 
but Carol never walked out of their 
life. That was the interesting part. 
Oh, how she loved ANDY and her two 
beautiful girls, Eleanor and Mary Clay. 
This disease strikes you at a time 
you don’t even know. You just come 
back from doing something most all of 
us do—the family photos, even getting 
ready for a campaign. You look at her 
face, and you look at the children’s 
faces. 
And you know ANDY. Carol did all the 
work. Carol prepared everybody. ANDY 
is a great legislator, but Carol made 
everything happen. 
I love when I meet people early on. I 
always ask, how did you first meet? I 
asked ANDY and Carol. ANDY would tell 
you the story. He saw her, and he could 
tell you the moment it happened. He 
had a plan. His plan, he had it all 
mapped out. He was going to ask for 
her business card. He just didn’t realize 
she didn’t have one. 
The problem with ANDY is, he didn’t 
have a backup plan. But the great 
thing about it is, God had already 
taken care of this. God already had a 
plan for ANDY and Carol. Eight weeks 
later, he brought them back together 
again. This time, ANDY didn’t let her 
get away. They were married for more 
than 13 years. 
I cannot tell you the loss we feel. 
ANDY feels it every day. The commu-
nity feels it every day. There is not a 
day that goes by that we don’t pray for 
him and the girls. There are times 
when I would pick up, just call and 
check on him. I remember doing it re-
cently. He said it was a good weekend. 
He took the girls, just the girls and 
him, and went to the place that the 
Barr family would always go to. It was 
in the woods. It was a time of reflec-
tion. 
There are others in this body that 
have had to deal with this type of loss, 
a loss in their own family. We all know 
the different ways to suffer. We are all 
familiar with the five different stages 
of grief—the denial, the anger, the bar-
gaining, the depression, and the accept-
ance. 
ANDY didn’t have time for any of 
them. ANDY channeled his grief into 
what I believe is the sixth stage, the 
lawmaker, and he did something im-
portant, working to honor Carol today 
but save lives for everybody else in the 
future. 
We are going to do work today that 
most people when they talk about Con-
gress wish we did every day. There is 
not going to be partisanship. I think if 
you met Carol, it didn’t matter what 
side of the aisle you were on. It would 
be harder to attack ANDY. We are going 
to save lives for the future, and that is 
exactly what this bill does, Madam 
Speaker. It saves lives. 
More than 25,000 Americans die from 
valvular heart disease every year. 
Many, like Carol, show no outward 
signs. You don’t have a warning. You 
kiss your spouse good-bye, and you are 
going to go down the street. The next 
thing, something goes wrong. 
Too often, the diagnosis comes down 
to luck. Carol got an indication, but we 
had COVID. We said to wait to have a 
procedure. 
We must do better. Our doctors and 
families deserve to have better infor-
mation so they can make the right de-
cisions about treatment. The CAROL 
Act will help get them the information 
by providing $20 million in research 
grants to study valvular heart prob-
lems. 
ANDY, your work to pass this bill in 
honor of Carol has truly been an inspi-
ration to all of us. Of all the moments 
that I had an opportunity to spend 
with them, I always reflect on this one. 
Like many of you, collectively, we will 
do a trip to Israel, legislatively, for-
eign policy. There was this moment in 
the trip—and you know the trip. It is 
filled with meetings after meetings 
after meetings. You are in a different 
time zone, and it gets tiring. You are 
up early until late at night.

December 8, 2021 
Carol would always be smiling. We 
were visiting this one facility with the 
Sermon on the Mount where Jesus had 
spoken. I remember standing next to 
her, reading the story in the Bible. I re-
member her smile. More importantly, I 
remember her love for all. 
I know she is with us today. I know 
she is proud of ANDY. She is proud of 
Eleanor and Mary Clay. Her work and 
life on this Earth was not long, but her 
impact was great. 
Today, what we are doing is right. 
Today, what we are doing is going to 
make tomorrow better. 
ANDY, your dedication, which is so 
ably represented in this important bill, 
is a fitting tribute to Carol. She had a 
heart for service. Anyone who knew 
her will tell you that. Today, we are 
going to honor her memory, and we are 
going to salute you. We are going to sa-
lute that Carol made a difference yes-
terday, today, and tomorrow. 
She will not be forgotten, be it 
through the caring, the sweetness, the 
kindness of her daughters; but, more 
importantly, the love and respect of 
her husband, who, in a very tragic situ-
ation, could go a lot of different paths. 
But I know he wondered what Carol 
would want to be done, and that is ex-
actly what he did. He put himself in a 
position to make the world better and 
to make fewer families to have that 
same call. 
I respect everybody I serve with. Peo-
ple go through a lot of challenges. 
There are very few people in my life 
who I have ever witnessed the dignity 
and the respect and the honor that 
ANDY has given to Carol for her life and 
her memory. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to support the bipartisan 
CAROL Act and my good friend, Rep-
resentative ANDY BARR, and so many 
others in this Nation who either have 
valvular heart disease or have lost 
loved ones to this disease. 
The CAROL Act is necessary now 
more than ever, as each year 25,000 
Americans lose their lives to this often 
hidden yet very deadly deficiency of 
the human heart. 
This legislation would help prevent 
those deaths by authorizing grant pro-
grams at the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute that will not only bol-
ster research on heart valve disease but 
also will help identify those with this 
disease so that they can treat this dis-
ease before it is too late. 
On behalf of the very fruitful life 
lived by Carol Barr, on behalf of the fu-
ture fulfilled lives of Mary Clay and El-
eanor Barr, I not only support the 
CAROL Act, but I, and I urge my col-
leagues to, stand in solidarity with 
ANDY BARR to give him our vote and 
the full strength to fulfill Carol’s leg-
acy and to continue carrying the torch 
so that those with this disease can con-
tinue living their lives to the fullest. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Repub-
lican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with a heavy heart but in strong sup-
port of this legislation, the CAROL 
Act. 
Clearly, if you look at the policy, we 
are here today to expand research on 
valvular heart disease to help save 
more lives, but we are also here to pay 
tribute to Carol Barr and talk about a 
special person that we were blessed to 
know. 
Carol was one of those people who 
would light up a room. I was blessed to 
be in many of those rooms with ANDY 
and Carol and their two beautiful 
daughters. Then, we got the news. It 
was news that you don’t wish upon 
anybody, but to watch how Andy has 
carried on a legacy since then, obvi-
ously caring for Carol’s legacy, caring 
for those two beautiful young daugh-
ters, but then turning it into some-
thing bigger with the CAROL Act. 
This legislation is going to help some 
of those 25,000 Americans who lose 
their lives every year to valvular heart 
disease, many of them young women 
like Carol. 
Hopefully, we can prevent others 
from having to go through what ANDY 
went through and what all of us went 
through because, while we battle on 
the day-to-day issues, we care about 
each other. We are family in many 
ways. We spend a lot of time here to-
gether. We get to know each other per-
sonally. 
I got to know ANDY. I was in charge 
of recruiting in 2012, and he was the 
first recruit that I called. We hit it off 
from day one and just developed an in-
credible friendship. With friendships 
like that, you get to know the families 
of the people that we serve with. Every 
time you were in a room with ANDY 
and Carol and their family, it was just 
a special, special time. 
I know so many of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who are express-
ing those same passions. At least we 
get to channel this into something 
positive that can help other people. 
ANDY, your strength in her death 
serves as a constant tribute to Carol’s 
life. Carol used to have a saying. She 
would say, ‘‘Just get it done.’’ Today, 
we are going to get something special 
done in honor of an incredibly special 
person. 
I am sure they have C–SPAN in Heav-
en, and I know Carol is watching right 
now, as she is so proud of the strength 
you have exhibited. But today, she 
knows that her name is also going to 
be attached to something that is going 
to save lives for years to come. 
God bless ANDY, his beautiful daugh-
ters, and Carol. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time, as we hear from the Republican 
Members. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
BARR), my good friend. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of an issue that is ob-
viously very personal to me, my legis-
lation, the Cardiovascular Advances in 
Research and Opportunities Legacy 
Act, or the CAROL Act. 
I am just overwhelmed and so grate-
ful to my friends and colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle. I thank them 
for their kindness, their kind words 
about Carol, and their advocacy for 
this very important legislation. 
I do ask for the indulgence of the 
House and my colleagues to speak 
about a topic that is very personal. I 
have become, unfortunately, very pas-
sionate about it. 
My life and my girls’ lives were 
changed forever when we lost Carol, 
who was my best friend, and that was a 
sudden cardiac event on June 16, 2020. 
She was only 39 years old. This was 
just a few weeks before her 40th birth-
day. 
The end of her life didn’t define her 
life. When people hear about the 
CAROL Act, I want them to know not 
just about the legislation. I want them 
to know about Carol, the woman who 
inspires it, because so much of her life 
really continues to make a positive im-
pact on all of us. 
First of all, Carol was obviously a 
beautiful person, but her beauty on the 
outside was not as much as it was on 
the inside, as beautiful as she was as a 
person. 
b 1615 
She was an amazing friend and 
daughter and wife. She was so sup-
portive. Everybody who serves in this 
body knows it takes so much support 
from a spouse, and I witnessed that 
every day both in this job and out of 
this job and in the 12 years that we 
were married. 
She was a supporter. She was a self-
less giver. And she was a giver not just 
to me and my girls, she was a selfless 
person with everyone, with her friends, 
with her family. She was always going 
out of her way to do for others and put 
others ahead of herself. 
Professionally she was incredibly ac-
complished. She worked in the pharma-
ceutical industry. She was a planner, a 
list maker, a detailed organizer, which 
was great for me because I wasn’t any 
of those things. She complemented me. 
She kept me going. She kept me on 
time and organized. I was not a list 
maker, and she was. She was a go-get-
ter. 
As my friend, Whip SCALISE, said, she 
had this great saying, and she said it to 
me the weekend before she passed 
away: ‘‘Just get it done.’’ 
But of course, her greatest legacy 
was her motherhood. She was defined 
by her motherhood of our girls, Elea-
nor and Mary Clay. She was the best 
mother in the world. Now, she only had 
9 and 7 years, but she packed it in, and 
she left a great mark on those kids, 
and they are her greatest legacy. I am 
so proud of our girls. And my youngest, 
Mary Clay, always says: ‘‘Daddy, when

you give those speeches, why don’t you 
talk about me? And, Mary Clay, I am 
talking about you, and I am talking 
about your sister, Eleanor, right now 
because you are your mother. You 
shine through, and your mother will 
continue to shine through you all. 
So what is Carol’s story? 
At a young age, in seventh grade, she 
was diagnosed with an underlying con-
dition called mitral valve prolapse or 
floppy valve syndrome. This is a typi-
cally benign condition that results in 
sudden cardiac death in only 0.2 per-
cent of the cases. 
The odds were decidedly in her favor, 
and she knew that, and she talked 
about that, and her physicians talked 
about that. They said it was no big 
deal. She said it was no big deal. I said 
it was no big deal because everybody 
thought it was no big deal. We just had 
to monitor it, and we did. 
And Carol sadly was one of those un-
lucky people in that 0.2 percent cat-
egory. She did have a near fainting epi-
sode, and she got a Holter monitor, and 
in early 2020 she sought help from a 
cardiologist, and in the medical notes 
the cardiologist said, yes, we need to 
further investigate this. Not urgent, 
but we need to investigate this. We 
need to get an echo stress test after the 
virus resolves. 
And there was no incident. There was 
no chest discomfort after that. There 
was nothing between March and, sadly, 
June 16 when I came home that night. 
So what factors placed Carol in the 
0.2 percent versus the 99.8 percent cat-
egory? 
That is what we don’t know. That is 
what we need to know for other fami-
lies. 
So in my discussions with top cardi-
ologists, medical experts, researchers, 
and advocates following Carol’s pass-
ing, I learned the extent to which the 
medical community seriously lacks an-
swers to this critical question. 
And sadly, over 25,000 Americans die 
each year from heart valve disease pri-
marily 
due 
to 
underdiagnosis 
and 
undertreatment of the condition. 
So inspired by the extraordinary life 
of my wife and also many experts, the 
cardiologists who contributed to this 
work with the help of experts at the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute, we introduced the CAROL Act to 
better equip our medical community 
with the resources needed to develop 
predictive 
models, 
inform 
commu-
nities, and save the lives of other loved 
ones. 
So specifically, the CAROL Act au-
thorizes a grant program administered 
by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute to support research on MVP. 
This legislation marshals the full 
power of 21st century medical innova-
tion and encourages the utilization of 
technological imaging and precision 
medicine to generate data on individ-
uals with valvular heart disease. 
It is through this research that we 
can help identify Americans at high 
risk of sudden cardiac death from val-
vular heart disease and develop pre-
diction models for high-risk patients, 
enabling interventions and treatment 
plans to keep these patients healthy 
throughout their lives. 
Additionally, the CAROL Act will in-
struct the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention to increase public 
awareness regarding symptoms of val-
vular heart disease and effective strat-
egies for preventing sudden cardiac 
death. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored and so 
grateful that this bill, the CAROL Act, 
has earned the bipartisan support of 
over 180 Members of this body and all 
of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle who have been critical to bringing 
this legislation to this point. The 
speakers here today, I am so humbled 
and grateful to them. To my good 
friend, Congressman GUTHRIE, who was 
a dear friend of my wife, to Minority 
Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY and Whip SCA-
LISE, both of whom knew and counted 
Carol as one of their friends, my good 
friends, KATHLEEN RICE and JIMMY PA-
NETTA on the other side, who have been 
just awesome to work with on this. 
Chairman PALLONE, I really appreciate 
your leadership and Leader HOYER, as 
well; my good friends BRAD WENSTRUP 
and BILL
HUIZENGA, who have been 
really helpful to me in this difficult 
time. And I am also grateful for my 
friend and fellow Kentuckian, Senate 
Republican Leader MITCH MCCONNELL, 
who is leading the companion bill in 
the 
Senate, 
and 
Arizona 
Senator 
KYRSTEN SINEMA, who I served with in 
my class here; sadly, Kyrsten lost a sis-
ter to a similar condition, and they are 
leading the companion legislation in 
the Senate. 
And, 
finally, 
I 
acknowledge 
and 
thank the over 20 medical groups who 
supported our bill, including the Amer-
ican Heart Association, the American 
College 
of 
Cardiologists, 
and 
WomenHeart, and the scores of doctors 
that we consulted who really were in-
strumental in helping us, and I will 
just say a few: Dr. Mary Sheppard, Dr. 
Alan Daugherty, and Dr. Nezar Falluji 
in the district that I represent at the 
University of Kentucky; also Dr. Gary 
Gibbons and his team at the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Dr. 
Francesca Delling at the University of 
California, San Francisco; and Dr. 
Bonow at Northwestern. They were all 
instrumental in crafting this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, in conclusion, Carol 
Barr’s greatest legacy will always be 
our two daughters, and she wouldn’t 
have wanted this. She doesn’t want 
this as her legacy. She wanted to raise 
our kids. But I will tell you this, even 
though the doctors said that her heart 
gave out, you know, because of her life 
and her legacy and this bill, she is 
going to be remembered as having the 
most powerful heart of all, of anyone 
we have ever met. I hope my colleagues 
in the House will help me move one 
step closer to enshrining that legacy in 
a way that will help others avert this 
tragedy that has so profoundly affected 
my family. 
And, honey, we are getting it done. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
KELLY of Illinois). The gentleman from 
Kentucky has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), another dear 
friend of my colleague from Kentucky 
and his wife, Carol. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman yielding, and 
I don’t know how you follow ANDY 
BARR and that story. 
Madam Speaker, ANDY talked a lot 
about Carol, as he should, but we also 
want to talk about him and how he re-
sponded. 
This is an opportunity to turn a trag-
edy into hope. And there are a lot of 
people that would be too bitter, too 
angry, too frustrated, too betrayed to 
take that opportunity and refocus it 
and turn it into help for others. Madam 
Speaker, ANDY is doing that, and he is 
showing his daughters what his wife 
would do. 
So to those of us who knew her, he is 
absolutely right, I can still hear in my 
mind’s ear this, ‘‘just get it done.’’ It 
would be a desperate tone sometimes, 
‘‘just get it done.’’ 
But the words that I think of as I was 
sitting here, and I have sort of thrown 
aside all the prepared remarks, and I 
want to speak from the heart. I just 
started writing down a few words. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Passionate, patriot, 
fierce—not mean, but fierce—and fo-
cused. She was a leader of teams, but a 
leader of her family, too. 
And, Madam Speaker, that is ANDY. 
He has been forced into some roles that 
he was not expecting he was going to 
have to take care of. And this is what 
he does best. He throws himself in. He 
dives in, and he works hard to help oth-
ers. And that, too, is a legacy, a legacy 
for Carol and for the girls. 
And for Eleanor and Mary Clay, may 
they know that their mom loved them. 
She loved them. And their dad loves 
them. And Carol is not with us today, 
but she is not gone because we won’t 
forget her. And we will make sure her 
legacy continues. 
Madam Speaker, we love ANDY, and 
we are here for him. I am so grateful 
we can help so many others around the 
country. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP), a good friend of 
ANDY’s, and I know he has taken ANDY 
under his wing over the last year. It is 
hard to believe it has been over a year. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to rise today in support of

December 8, 2021 
my good friend, my dear friend, Con-
gressman ANDY BARR and his legisla-
tion named, of course, in memory of 
his late wife, Carol. 
ANDY
knows Monica and I loved 
being with Carol and ANDY whenever 
we could. Whenever we could get to-
gether it was great, especially when we 
traveled together. 
Let me talk about the bill for a sec-
ond. The Cardiovascular Advances in 
Research and Opportunities Legacy 
Act, or CAROL Act, will help to ad-
vance research on valvular heart dis-
ease. 
Specifically, 
this 
bill 
authorizes 
grants that allow us to identify and de-
velop a cohort of individuals with val-
vular disease. 
We will then be able to gather data 
and help doctors determine which indi-
viduals are at high risk of sudden car-
diac death. 
And finally, the bill will convene sub-
ject matter experts to strategize on 
what research is needed to develop 
guidelines for treatment of patients 
with mitral valve prolapse. 
As a doctor, I know this legislation 
will undoubtedly help to save many 
lives. 
The bill’s 180 cosponsors, who span 
the political spectrum, are a testament 
to how important this body believes 
this bill to be. 
Today, we take another step towards 
getting this bill across the finish line. 
It will be a fitting tribute to a beau-
tiful life when we see it signed into 
law. 
Madam Speaker, I know Carol is 
beaming with pride as she looks down 
on ANDY today. And ANDY and Carol’s 
girls, Eleanor and Mary Clay, are even 
more proud of both their mom and 
their dad than they already are on this 
particular day. 
So may God bless ANDY and Carol 
Barr. Carol reached out and touched 
the face of God, but the positive effects 
of her life and ANDY’s work will never 
perish. Their legacies are that they 
bring good things to life. So I am glad 
to see all of my colleagues here to sup-
port this bill, and I urge its passage. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Mrs. RODGERS). 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, first, to my colleague 
and friend, ANDY BARR, what a beau-
tiful tribute to Carol. And I join my 
colleagues, everyone here today, in 
strong support of the CAROL Act. We 
love you. We love Carol. Our hearts go 
out to you. 
I am sitting here, and I am thinking 
what a beautiful tribute. And to Elea-
nor and Mary Clay, I just saw their 
Christmas card, and I was thinking 
they are beautiful, and they are loved, 
and they shine brightly just like their 
mom did. I know that this has been 
such a difficult time, and to see ANDY 
step forward, bring this legislation— 
the CAROL Act that is going to help 
thousands of others across the coun-
try—to highlight important research 
that needs to be done so that others 
will not have to go through something 
similar because ANDY has led in such a 
strong way. We are grateful to know 
ANDY, and we want him to know that 
he is not alone. 
I will always remember the times 
that I was with Carol. She was one of 
those people who seemed to do it all 
and do it all so well. And my memory 
of her is one of just lighting up the 
room. She shined so brightly. And 
ANDY
continues to shine. And their 
girls are shining today. 
We join today in strong support of 
this legislation. It is going to help us 
get answers so that others will not be 
impacted the same way. And let’s get 
this done, as Carol said. 
b 1630 
Mr. 
GUTHRIE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, this is a great legacy for a great 
woman and her children. Every time I 
see them, we all tear up but we know 
that they are carrying on her legacy. I 
know that her husband is here today 
moving forward with her legacy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the passage of the 
bill, and I thank the gentleman for 
yielding to the gentlewoman from 
Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, let 
me just say again what a tribute that 
ANDY BARR has made to his wife. 
Madam Speaker, this is such an im-
portant bill in terms of trying to deal 
with this disease. Again, I urge bipar-
tisan support, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1193, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend title IV of 
the Public Health Service Act to direct 
the Director of the National Institutes 
of Health, in consultation with the Di-
rector of the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, to establish a program 
under which the Director of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health shall sup-
port or conduct research on valvular 
heart disease, and for other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DR. LORNA BREEN HEALTH CARE 
PROVIDER PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1667) to address behavioral 
health and well-being among health 
care professionals, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1667 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1667. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has placed an extraordinary 
amount of stress on physicians and 
other health professionals. According 
to a recent survey by the Physician 
Foundation, nationwide, half of physi-
cians report feeling anxious due to 
COVID–19-related concerns, and nearly 
60 percent report experiencing burnout. 
That is a significant increase from just 
two years ago. 
Yet, many are not getting the help 
they need. Only 13 percent of providers 
have sought treatment to address pan-
demic-related mental health concerns. 
Nearly half of emergency physicians 
report not feeling comfortable seeking 
mental health treatment for fear of 
professional or personal repercussions, 
even though 87 percent say they have 
been experiencing increased stress. 
Now, earlier this year, Congress took 
action in the American Rescue Plan to 
address these concerns. We invested in 
training for healthcare professionals on 
strategies to reduce burnout and stig-
ma associated with seeking mental 
healthcare; and we provided support to 
the employers of frontline providers so 
they can better care for the mental 
health needs of their workforce. 
These were important investments 
for a workforce stretched to the limit, 
but there is still more to be done. And 
that is why Congress must pass H.R. 
1667, the Dr. Lorna Breen Healthcare 
Provider Protection Act. 
This legislation is named in honor of 
Dr. Lorna Breen, a sister, friend, 
daughter, and emergency department 
physician, who tragically died by sui-
cide after the physical and mental toll 
of the pandemic became too unbear-
able. Dr. Breen was fearful of seeking 
assistance for her debilitating mental 
burden, which left her despondent and 
physically unable to move from her of-
fice chair. 
Earlier this year, her family testified 
before the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce about how the workload and 
stress of her position during the begin-
ning of the pandemic broke an other-
wise indomitable spirit of a compas-
sionate woman with a strong love of 
her job and her coworkers and her pa-
tients. 
The Dr. Lorna Breen Healthcare Pro-
vider Protection Act will make signifi-
cant strides in improving access to 
mental and behavioral health services. 
First, the bill authorizes grants for 
training health profession students, 
residents, or healthcare professionals 
in evidence-informed strategies to re-
duce and prevent suicide, burnout, 
mental health conditions, and sub-
stance use disorders. 
It will also identify and disseminate 
evidence-informed best practices for re-
ducing and preventing suicide and 
burnout 
among 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals. The legislation also establishes 
a national evidence-based education 
and 
awareness 
campaign 
targeting 
healthcare professionals to encourage 
them to seek support and treatment 
for mental and behavioral health con-
cerns. And finally, it calls for a com-
prehensive study to be conducted on 
healthcare professional mental and be-
havioral health and burnout. 
This bill received unanimous support 
in the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and is part of a series of bipar-
tisan bills the committee has worked 
on 
to 
bolster 
and 
support 
our 
healthcare workforce. 
I thank the sponsors of this bill, 
most 
importantly, 
Representative 
WILD, who was the lead sponsor, and 
my colleagues on the committee for 
their steadfast work in honoring Dr. 
Breen, her family, and the countless 
healthcare providers who will now have 
additional support and resources avail-
able to them. It is my hope that this 
bill will lead to more healthcare pro-
viders seeking help when they need it 
without fear of repercussions or stig-
ma. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. UPTON) will control the time 
for the minority. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. UPTON for yield-
ing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7524 
December 8, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1667, the Dr. Lorna Breen 
Healthcare Provider Act. This bill 
strikes close to home for me. I know a 
gentleman who served in our Armed 
Forces as an enlisted hospital corps-
man and advocated for this bill. 
He responded after the 2011 earth-
quake in Haiti, working in an intensive 
care unit and caring for local residents, 
even as an estimated 200,000 lives were 
lost. He and many of his fellow corps-
men were teenagers at the time. 
Upon returning home, he thought, as 
this bill calls it, that he was simply 
burned out. Many of those he served 
with would abruptly leave the service 
or transition to administrative duties. 
After suffering from flashbacks dur-
ing emergency and medical situations, 
though, this gentleman would quietly 
leave the service as well, recognizing 
that he could no longer render the care 
that he had been trained to give. It 
would take nearly a decade for him to 
begin 
accessing 
mental 
health 
re-
sources that he needed. 
Madam Speaker, I tell this story, 
with his permission, of course, to make 
two points. 
First, that widespread provider burn-
out can lead to staffing shortages. 
Second, that many times we use the 
phrase 
‘‘burnout’’ 
to 
hide 
deeper 
wounds. Burnout implies a short-term 
change, one that seemingly heals with 
a break or a vacation. But as our hos-
pitals have overflowed in places with 
COVID patients, burnout can be some-
thing more serious. 
That is why this bill is important. It 
establishes a communication campaign 
to educate and encourage providers to 
seek care. It will decrease costs by es-
tablishing grant programs for providers 
who use that care, and it will produce 
cutting-edge science on the problem of 
burnout among physicians. 
Madam Speaker, let me close by say-
ing 
that 
all 
healthcare 
providers 
should know that accessing the re-
sources this act will provide is a good 
thing. It means they are still human 
enough to appreciate the tragedies 
they experience. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), the lead 
sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bill, the Dr. 
Lorna Breen Healthcare Provider Pro-
tection Act, which will finally provide 
resources 
and 
support 
to 
our 
healthcare heroes who face burnout 
and mental health crisis as a result of 
their experiences with COVID–19. 
America owes an incredible debt of 
gratitude to these professionals who 
work to keep us safe and healthy. Doc-
tors die by suicide at twice the rate of 
the general population. The trauma of 
their experience during COVID—and 
before—while 
treating 
patients 
is 
something we must address head on. 
Dr. Lorna Breen was the emergency 
room director at New York Pres-
byterian Hospital and was a hero who 
embodied the spirit of service in our 
time of national crisis. She died by sui-
cide in April 2020 at the peak of the 
COVID crisis in New York after con-
tracting COVID herself, quarantining, 
and then returning to work. 
Her father said, ‘‘She was truly in the 
trenches of the frontline. She tried to 
do her job and it killed her. Make sure 
she is praised as a hero. She was a cas-
ualty of this pandemic as much as any-
one else who died.’’ 
I am honored in her memory to lead 
this bill to prevent burnout among the 
health professionals answering the call 
of duty. I thank my seven co-leads, 
RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI, DAVID MCKIN-
LEY, JUDY CHU, FRED UPTON, HALEY 
STEVENS, MORGAN GRIFFITH, and JOHN 
KATKO, and to note that the strong bi-
partisan support that this bill enjoys is 
confirmation that Congress can still 
come together to tackle big problems. 
I thank Jennifer and Corey Feist, Dr. 
Breen’s sister and brother-in-law, who 
have championed this bill from the be-
ginning to ensure that Lorna’s legacy 
is codified here in the halls of Con-
gress. But most of all, I thank every 
last doctor, nurse, EMT, custodial 
staffer, food service worker, and espe-
cially our emergency room doctors who 
put themselves into harm’s way to 
keep the rest of us safe. Our work to 
secure for you the support you need is 
far from over. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I might consume. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank 
the leadership on our committee. I 
thank Mr. PALLONE, Ms. MCMORRIS 
RODGERS, Mr. GUTHRIE, and obviously, 
Chair ANNA ESHOO, and our staffs for 
moving this legislation forward. 
Madam Speaker, this is a very impor-
tant bill. All of our healthcare work-
ers, particularly in this COVID pan-
demic, are really heroes. They are, 
without exception. All of us know 
many of these workers because they 
are our neighbors and friends. And each 
of us have heard those cries of woe as 
they have done their job every day, 
every day, day after day for 24/7. 
I can’t imagine how they do it; 
watching so many folks suffer as they 
try to help them from their hospital 
beds. Passing on the sad words that 
they passed away to family members, 
maybe not even in person because of 
this terrible pandemic. And thinking of 
the hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans that have died because of this 
awful disease, let alone so many more 
across the globe. 
Well, one of those healthcare workers 
who was well-publicized at the time 
was Lorna Breen, a physician from 
Charlottesville, working on the front 
lines of the pandemic in New York, 
moving up there to try and help the 
need. And, yes, as it was mentioned, 
took her own life. 
This was a national story. It gripped 
the Nation. I can remember watching 
the news show that week as this tragic 
story was portrayed. It outlined the se-
vere stress that this pandemic has put 
on our healthcare workers and the need 
for the resources that they need to help 
them cope. The demands that our 
healthcare heroes are facing, they have 
not changed. They haven’t changed 
yet. For months, for a year-and-a-half, 
they have been asked to care for com-
munities in my district in Southwest 
Michigan and across the country 24/7 as 
the pandemic continues. This bill helps 
us have their backs. 
Madam Speaker, I talk to major hos-
pitals in my district every week. And 
the common refrain that we have been 
hearing throughout the State of Michi-
gan is that our hospitals are still 
strained to the breaking point. Staff 
shortages are severe. I saw a story a 
few hours ago but I think the State of 
Maine is now taking up their National 
Guard. We have asked for national help 
from President Biden as well in Michi-
gan. There have been too many exam-
ples of healthcare workers that are suf-
fering from this enormous pressure as 
they fight the worst public health cri-
sis in a century. 
This legislation is going to help pro-
mote mental and behavioral health for 
those healthcare professionals, improv-
ing their overall well-being and maybe 
even saving their own lives. This bill 
helps promote mental and behavioral 
health among those working on the 
front lines of the pandemic. It supports 
training for health professionals to pre-
vent suicide and burnout, and it in-
creases awareness about suicide and 
mental health concerns among their 
peers. 
I am glad that we are considering 
this important bill and that we will 
vote on it yet tonight. I look forward 
to having it being signed into law. 
Again, I thank the bipartisan co-
operation on both sides of the aisle. 
Hopefully, we can get our Senate col-
leagues—and I know that they are with 
us on this—to work together to get this 
bill to the President as soon as we can. 
We can’t wait another day. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Dr. 
Lorna Breen Act. 
The past 2 years have stretched our 
Nation to the brink. No one has shoul-
dered this burden more than our 
healthcare 
workers. 
The 
doctors, 
nurses, and all healthcare workers who 
have worked day in and day out 
through surge after surge have put 
their lives on hold to care for us and 
our loved ones as the pandemic spread 
around the country. 
In many instances, they have done 
this while understaffed, without suffi-
cient PPE, and knowing that they are 
putting their own lives at risk before a 
vaccine was available to them. This 
can have a profound impact on a pro-
vider’s mental health. Today, we are

taking an important step to ensure 
that they get the help they need. 
The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care 
Provider Protection Act establishes 
grants for training healthcare workers 
and strategies to reduce and prevent 
suicide burnout, mental health condi-
tions, and substance use disorders. It 
also establishes a national awareness 
campaign to encourage healthcare pro-
fessionals to seek support and treat-
ment for mental health issues. 
As one of the two psychologists in 
Congress, I know how much mental 
healthcare matters and how much stig-
ma can prevent someone from getting 
the help they need. By passing this bill 
today, we can say to healthcare work-
ers: You are not alone. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this critical legisla-
tion. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am ready to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of the Dr. Lorna Breen Act. 
My wife, Priya, is a physician. Like 
her colleagues, she has worked tire-
lessly during the pandemic. During the 
pandemic, people have referred to these 
healthcare workers as heroes, but as 
you know, our heroes are human. They 
struggle with the trauma of losing col-
leagues and patients, and they expose 
themselves to the daily risks of COVID. 
They suffer from burnout, depression, 
and suicide. 
In fact, before the pandemic, one 
physician every day committed sui-
cide. That rate has gone up signifi-
cantly during the pandemic. 
I am reminded of the situation of Dr. 
Scott Jolley in Utah. He would some-
times work until 3 a.m. as the only 
physician on duty at his hospital in 
Utah. By November 2020, he was diag-
nosed with PTSD, and by February 
2021, he had committed suicide. 
These tragic losses and stories from 
medical professionals are unending. 
Today, in honor of one of these heroes, 
Dr. Lorna Breen, the Dr. Lorna Breen 
Health Care Provider Protection Act 
was created and will expand access to 
mental and behavioral health resources 
to help our heroes, to help them cope 
with the stresses and anxieties that 
they face every single day. 
Unfortunately, some of those stresses 
and anxieties will continue after this 
pandemic. That is why this act is so 
important. I look forward to passing 
this necessary piece of legislation 
today. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, for 
too long, healthcare providers strug-
gling with mental illness have suffered 
in silence, intimidated by stigma and 
afraid of being penalized for seeking 
treatment. 
Even before the pandemic, 42 percent 
of the physicians reported experiencing 
burnout, and 40 percent reported a re-
luctance to seek treatment for a med-
ical health condition. This is far too 
many people suffering in silence. 
How can we expect our doctors to 
take care of us when they feel they 
can’t take care of themselves? 
The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care 
Provider Protection Act, named for a 
doctor who lost her life to suicide after 
fighting on the front lines of the pan-
demic, will help reduce and prevent 
suicide, burnout, and mental health 
conditions of healthcare professionals. 
It does so by supporting training to 
prevent suicide and burnout; creating a 
national awareness campaign encour-
aging healthcare professionals to seek 
support for mental health concerns; 
and 
establishing 
a 
comprehensive 
study on healthcare professional men-
tal health and burnout, including the 
impact of the pandemic. 
Our healthcare professionals have 
been serving on the front lines, taking 
care of us amid an unprecedented glob-
al pandemic. It is time we take care of 
them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this critical legisla-
tion. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to voice support for my 
friend Representative SUSAN WILD’s bi-
partisan Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care 
Provider Protection Act, a bill that es-
tablishes 
training 
programs 
for 
healthcare workers to prevent suicide 
and burnout. 
As I am here in Congress today, I 
think of my constituents back home in 
Michigan who are in the midst of an-
other COVID–19 spike, who are in our 
hospitals telling us they are full, who 
cannot provide care in the way they 
have been trained and taught and in 
the way they would like to. These 
spikes leave us exhausted. They leave 
our healthcare workers all the more 
stressed. 
People are being pushed to the limit. 
Since the start of this pandemic, 
Michigan’s healthcare workforce has 
become fragile. We have lost workers 
due to the stress of this pandemic, yet 
this bipartisan legislation that brings 
us together here today will provide 
support to the workforce. 
Michigan healthcare workers deserve 
this. They are working and are con-
tinuing to work on the front lines of 
this pandemic. It is time to change how 
our healthcare industry approaches 
mental health. We must step up to pro-
vide a more reliable culture and sup-
portive infrastructure for healthcare 
professionals to count on for years to 
come. 
It took a pandemic for us to get this

New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4555. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, oral health is an im-
portant component of general health 
and well-being, but it is a big problem 
for many Americans. Tooth decay is 
the most common chronic disease in 
both children and adults in the United 
States. More than one in four adults 
have untreated cavities, and nearly 
half of American adults show signs of 
gum disease. 
Regular preventative dental care can 
catch these oral health problems early 
when they are easiest to treat. Unfor-
tunately, less than half of Americans 
use the oral healthcare system. One of 
the 
best 
ways 
to 
promote 
oral 
healthcare is to increase oral health 
literacy. 
H.R. 4555, the Oral Health Literacy 
and Awareness Act, will accomplish 
this by expanding oral health literacy 
programs. H.R. 4555 will authorize a 
public education campaign to increase 
oral health literacy and awareness 
across all relevant programs of the 
Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration. 
This bill will also help us learn about 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
targeted 
oral 
health literacy campaigns, and it will 
inform future efforts to improve oral 
health literacy for all Americans. 
I want to thank Representatives 
CA´ RDENAS and BILIRAKIS, members of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
for their bipartisan work on this legis-
lation. I urge my colleagues to support 
this important bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak on H.R. 4555, the Oral Health Lit-
eracy and Awareness Act of 2021, spon-
sored by my Energy and Commerce 
Committee colleagues, Representatives 
BILIRAKIS and CA´ RDENAS. 
We all know that oral health plays 
such an important role in an individ-
ual’s overall health and well-being. A 
lack of proper oral hygiene has been 
proven to increase the risk of chronic 
health conditions. 
However, good oral hygiene and den-
tal checkups, in addition to increased 
education, can help patients avoid 
most oral health ailments. It is so im-
portant for kids to develop healthy 
habits at a young age. 
This bill directs the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration to 
develop a public education campaign to 
increase 
oral 
health 
literacy 
and 
awareness. By increasing such, the bill 
will promote good oral health habits 
and will help to prevent the develop-
ment of avoidable, complex medical 
conditions in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. I remind 
them this bill, as I recall, passed unani-
mously in the committee and should 
not be a problem. I thank my chairman 
and ranking member for getting this 
bill to the House floor quickly. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS), a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee who is the lead sponsor of the 
bill. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for this oppor-
tunity for us to pass these amazing 
bills. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take note: 
The seven bills that we are discussing 
on the floor over the last hour and a 
half, which we will soon vote with the 
entire body of this House, all of those 
bills passed out of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee unanimously. That 
means every Republican and Democrat 
voted ‘‘yes.’’ There were no ‘‘no’’ votes. 
I feel it is important for us to men-
tion that because when you look at the 
press, they think that all we are doing 
here is arguing, fussing, and fighting 
with each other, but we do work to-
gether. 
To all of my Republican colleagues 
on the committee and Democratic col-
leagues on the committee, thank you 
so much for doing our job. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan bill with Congressman BILIRAKIS, 
the Oral Health Literacy and Aware-
ness Act of 2021. 
Oral health is whole body health. It 
is often neglected by parents who, un-
fortunately, lack resources and knowl-
edge. 
Oral health accounts for some of the 
deepest health disparities in all low-in-
come families across America. For 
many, the cost of dental neglect can be 
detrimental, especially for children. 
Arthritis, autoimmune disease, cardio-
vascular disease, inflammatory skin 
disorders, gut issues, and more can all 
be caused or worsened by untreated 
tooth decay and oral disease. 
According to the CDC, children who 
have poor oral health often miss more 
school and receive lower grades than 
children who don’t. Even more alarm-
ing, Latino kids, like those in my dis-
trict, experience two times more tooth 
decay and cavities than their White 
peers. 
b 1700 
We can and must do better for our 
children and our country. Most of these 
issues can be prevented with access to 
the right information and resources. 
Our legislation will help low-income 
families and communities of color 
learn about the benefits of regular den-
tal care and empower them to make 
better decisions on their overall oral 
health. 
Madam Speaker, this is a picture of a 
child’s mouth. Too many children 
across America are going through this 
pain, through this detrimental situa-
tion, because their parents don’t under-
stand that they can do better for their 
children with better practices and in-
formation. That is what this bill is 
about. 
Once parents have access to informa-
tion on the importance of healthy hab-
its, they can prevent this kind of re-
sult. These tips help families and chil-
dren maintain long-term oral hygiene 
at home. Through simple education 
and awareness campaigns, we will en-
sure families are better equipped to 
take control of their family’s health. 
We can’t cut corners here, Madam 
Speaker. Let’s start ensuring oral 
health is part of the conversation in 
every home every day as often as pos-
sible. It is the only way we will make 
sure that children across America do 
not suffer like this child has suffered. 
I also want to say, once again, thank 
you to Chairman PALLONE, House sub-
committee Chairwoman ANNA ESHOO, 
and all of my colleagues, Republican 
and Democrat, on the committee for 
passing this bill. 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I would 
again urge my colleagues to support 
this bill passed unanimously in the 
greatest committee on the face of the 
Earth. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge bipartisan support for this bill. 
As Mr. CA´ RDENAS said, there is noth-
ing, really, more important than oral 
health. We know there are so many 
times when poor dental care has led to 
much more severe problems of all 
sorts, so this is really an important 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge its support, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I move to sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 
5119) to amend title VI of the Social Se-
curity Act to extend the coverage of 
Coronavirus Relief Fund payments to 
Tribal Governments, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5119 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 
1. 
EXTENSION 
OF 
COVERAGE 
OF 
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND PAY-
MENTS TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. 
Section 601(d)(3) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 801(d)(3)) is amended by inserting 
‘‘(or, in the case of costs incurred by a Tribal 
government, during the period that begins 
on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 31, 
2022)’’ after ‘‘December 31, 2021’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5119, a bill to extend the 
availability of Coronavirus Relief Fund 
payments allocated to Tribal Govern-
ments under the CARES Act of 2020 for 
1 additional year. 
This bipartisan bill was introduced 
by Mr. O’HALLERAN of Arizona and Mr. 
YOUNG of Alaska with companion legis-
lation sponsored by Mr. SULLIVAN and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI in the Senate. 
The historic CARES Act was signed 
into law on March 27, 2020, and in-
cluded critical aid for States, terri-
tories, Tribes, and large localities to 
combat 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
However, the Treasury Department did 
not have a preexisting allocation proc-
ess for disbursing the $8 billion set 
aside for Tribes. 
According to a GAO review, it took 
extra time to set up these processes. 
Treasury also established some alloca-
tion methodologies without consulting 
with Tribes first, which led to legal 
challenges and even further delays of 
emergency relief. 
Taken together, these delays have re-
sulted in a compressed timeframe for 
Tribal 
Governments 
to 
put 
their 
CARES Act funds to work, which is un-
acceptable in light of the dispropor-
tionate impact the pandemic has had 
on the Tribal community. 
According to a report by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
COVID–19 infections were 3.5 times 
higher for American Indians and Alas-
ka Natives compared to White Ameri-
cans during the first 7 months of the 
pandemic. Other reports revealed that 
1 in 475 Native Americans in the U.S. 
died from COVID–19 compared to 1 in 
825 White Americans. 
The ravages of the pandemic have 
been compounded for our Tribal neigh-
bors due to longstanding health dis-
parities and social inequities. The 
deaths of Tribal elders from COVID–19 
caused an incalculable and irreplace-
able loss of cultural knowledge and 
language. 
Tribes must be given a fair oppor-
tunity to put Federal aid dollars to 
work tackling these serious issues. 
H.R. 5119 is a commonsense step to en-
sure that Tribes have parity with re-
cipients who have not faced similar 
delays in gaining access to CARES Act 
funding. 
Finally, I want to assure my col-
leagues that CBO has confirmed that 
this bill does not increase Federal 
spending. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, last year, Congress 
set aside $8 billion in the CARES Act 
for Tribal Governments to spend on 
pandemic-related expenses. However, 
much of this $8 billion was held up in 
litigation and distributed to Tribes 
only 4 short months ago, more than a 
year after the funds were originally ap-
propriated. 
This money is supposed to be used by 
December 31, 2021, about 3 weeks from 
today. But it is irresponsible to expect 
Tribal Governments to spend all this 
money within a few months of receiv-
ing it. 
This bill would extend the deadline 
an additional year, giving Tribes more 
time to responsibly allocate these 
funds and best serve their people. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive YOUNG of Alaska and Representa-
tive COLE of Oklahoma, for their ef-
forts in working on this matter. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), who is the 
dean of the House. 
Mr. 
YOUNG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this legislation. It is badly 
needed. 
First, I want to thank Chairwoman 
CAROLYN MALONEY and Ranking Mem-
ber JAMES COMER for their quick work. 
I have been trying for a long time to 
try to get this bill passed. I have asked 
everybody to put it in the CR and into 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, but we didn’t get it there. But the 
gentleman has brought it to the floor, 
so I thank both Representatives for 
doing that. Of course, I thank Speaker 
PELOSI, Chairwoman DELAURO, and 
Leader MCCARTHY. 
This is badly needed, as was men-
tioned by the previous speakers. We are 
now 23 days away, and a tremendous 
amount of money is on the table. 
It wasn’t their fault. A lot of litiga-
tion was occurring so the money 
couldn’t be spent. Consequently, if 
they don’t spend it, they lose it, and 
they can’t take care of the health prob-
lems caused by COVID. So this is a 
good piece of bipartisan legislation. 
But we are not done because we do 
have to continue this as it goes to the 
Senate. I am urging my leaders to ask 
the Senate to really get this bill done. 
It is needed, it is right, and it is justi-
fied. Let’s take care of those first 
Americans in this legislation because 
of COVID. It can be done. 
Again, I thank both Members for the 
work they have done and the body of 
the House for voting ‘‘yes’’ on the leg-
islation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
dean of the House, the outstanding 
leader from the great State of Alaska, 
for his insightful comments and for 
fighting so hard for the residents of 
Alaska, the Alaska Native residents, 
and the American Indians. This bill 
will take care of the Tribes in many of 
our States across the country. 
I also want to thank my colleague, 
Mr. O’HALLERAN, who could not be with 
us. He has a conflict with another com-
mittee meeting. 
I want to thank the Democratic lead-
ership here in the House, Speaker 
PELOSI and the Democratic team, for 
bringing this to the floor and also Mr. 
COMER, Mr. LATURNER, and others for 
being part of this bipartisan effort. 
This is truly a bipartisan effort. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and if the gentleman from 
Kansas is ready, then I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
LATURNER for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7528 
December 8, 2021 
It has been said before, but it bears 
repeating: 24 days. That is how long 
Tribal Governments have to utilize 
their CARES Act funding before the 
December 31 deadline. 
I talked to a number of Tribes that, 
rather than rushed to spend this money 
in recent months, tried to be thought-
ful and deliberate about how to make 
these 
critically 
important 
invest-
ments. As a result, a number of them 
have millions of dollars left unspent. 
In that kind of environment, it is 
proper and prudent for us to extend the 
deadline, and we should do so. That is 
why I wholeheartedly support this bill. 
But I wouldn’t feel right if I didn’t 
point out that there is a better way, 
and it is, indeed, right before us, 
Madam Speaker. The solution is S. 
3011, the State, Local, Tribal, and Ter-
ritorial Fiscal Recovery, Infrastruc-
ture, and Disaster Relief Flexibility 
Act. 
Now, the House companion to that 
Senate bill has been led by Democratic 
Representative 
CAROLYN
BOURDEAUX 
and myself. It has overwhelming sup-
port—125 bipartisan cosponsors. 
Our bill would do the exact same 
thing as the one before us tonight. 
Well, that is not quite right. I think 
our bill is superior in a few ways. 
First off, it doesn’t just provide flexi-
bility to Tribal Governments as this 
bill would rightfully do. It also pro-
vides that kind of flexibility to States 
and localities that also desperately 
need it. 
That is not the only way in which the 
Bourdeaux-Johnson bill is superior, 
and the dean of the House alluded to it 
earlier when he was talking. Our bill 
has already passed the Senate. This bill 
has not. In fact, the bill that I am talk-
ing about passed the Senate unani-
mously, and it has been sitting on the 
Speaker’s desk since October 20. 
Yes, it is true we find ourselves with 
only 24 days for Tribal Governments to 
act, but it didn’t have to be that way, 
and it doesn’t have to be that way. 
My question for the Speaker would 
be: If our bill was good enough for 100 
Senators, why is it not good enough for 
the House? 
b 1715 
And this legislative approach just 
means that we are going to go a few 
more days until tribes have the cer-
tainty they need. 
So Madam Speaker, I would close 
with this. If we brought S. 3011 up to-
night and passed it, it could be law be-
fore midnight and tribes would not 
have the uncertainty that they con-
tinue to face. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, the gentleman 
raised some important points, and it is 
under consideration. But this bill is be-
fore us right now, and it is an impor-
tant bill. 
Madam Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Kansas has no further speakers, 
then I am prepared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
Madam Speaker, because I believe 
this is sensible legislation and good for 
tribal governments, I will vote in sup-
port of this bill. I urge my colleagues 
to support this needed and bipartisan 
legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his leadership on this 
important bill, and also the dean of the 
House, Mr. YOUNG, for his passionate 
support, who expressed so clearly the 
need of this important bill. 
I thank Mr. COMER. It was good to 
work together in a bipartisan way. 
And I want to also thank the Demo-
cratic leadership for bringing this bill 
to the floor. 
I urge passage of H.R. 5119, as amend-
ed, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
LEGACY OF SENATOR ROBERT J. 
DOLE 
(Mr. ESTES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise with my colleague from the Sun-
flower State to remember the life and 
legacy of a great American icon—a son 
of Kansas, World War II hero, and pub-
lic servant, Senator Robert J. Dole. 
Most of us in this Chamber have 
memories of Senator Dole or have been 
inspired by his public service. His life 
is one that epitomizes the American 
spirit and is a guide for public servants 
and leaders regardless of party. 
Bob was born in rural America, a star 
athlete and on track to be a doctor 
when our Nation was thrust into war. 
He chose his country over himself, like 
so many young men did in the Greatest 
Generation, and it forever changed 
him. Upon his return, his body had 
been greatly damaged by the effects of 
war, but his resolve and love of country 
were only made stronger. 
Our Nation is better because of the 
contributions of Senator Bob Dole. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members 
rise for a moment of silence in remem-
brance of the life and legacy of Senator 
Bob Dole.

minute and to revise and extend his re-

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to bring congratulations to the 
division 3A women’s volleyball State 
champions, Reservoir High School of 
Fulton, Maryland, a school I am proud 
to say is located in Maryland’s Third 
District. 
This outstanding team finished the 
season with a remarkable 18–1 record. 
They won the triple crown of cham-
pionships: the Howard County Cham-
pionship, the 3A East Region Cham-
pionship, and the 3A State Champion-
ship. 
The Gators were led by head coach 
Carole Ferrante and assistant coaches 
Holly 
Hynson, 
Julie 
Poston, 
and 
Meghan Kelley. 
Again, congratulations to these out-
standing athletes: Gabby, Lexi, Haley, 
Samiha, Azariah, Chaeli, Madison, Des-
tiny, Kelsey, Anjola, Elsie, Maddie, 
Jessica, Madison, and Mayah. 
We are proud of their accomplish-
ments. Well done.

BIDENFLATION WORSENS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the fake news concealing of 
Bidenflation only reinforces manipula-
tion of facts. Real people see with their 
eyes Biden policies are disastrous, de-
stroying jobs. 
Anti-energy stopping of pipelines and 
pausing leases for oil and gas have in-
tentionally raised pump prices 61 per-
cent. This leads to higher costs in food

prices and transportation costs for all 
products, and home heating is up 54 
percent. 
With inflation at a 40-year high after 
the most expensive Thanksgiving, now 
we face the most expensive Hanukkah 
and Christmas. 
The Democrat elite think they are 
smarter than everyone and think Dem-
ocrat voters and Democrat media are 
ignorant to believe that this $4.5 tril-
lion costs zero dollars. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from the Afghani-
stan safe haven to America. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome 
Hunter Taylor Wilson, Jr., born today 
at 2 a.m., son of Dr. Julianne Jett Wil-
son and my No. 4 son, Hunter Taylor 
Wilson, Sr., of West Columbia, South 
Carolina.

REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT 
J. DOLE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
night to recognize a great American, a 
man whose accomplishments during 
the 20th and 21st centuries are legend 
already. 
Senator Robert Dole was a war hero 
who fought against Nazi forces in the 
horrific battles on the Italian front and 
was gravely wounded. Following the 
20th century’s Allied victory against 
tyranny, he went on to serve as one of 
America’s finest statesmen. He was 
strong, faithful, honest, and indefati-
gable. 
My friendship with Senator Dole was 
forged during the 17-year quest to se-
cure a fitting World War II memorial 
here in our Nation’s Capitol that hon-
ors the 16 million Americans who put it 
all on the line when the world needed 
them most. 
Our Nation needs leaders like Bob 
Dole today. He understood that ex-
treme partisanship could not bring 
about the common good. Instead, we 
must work together to deliver the 
promises of the American Dream. 
He left us with this wise advice: 
‘‘America needs unity to rediscover its 
greatness.’’ 
Godspeed, Senator Dole. You will be 
greatly missed and remembered al-
ways.

MARY 
ANN 
CHAVEY’S 
RETIRE-
MENT FROM PENN STATE UNI-
VERSITY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate and 
recognize Mary Ann Chavey for her re-
tirement from Penn State University, 
my alma mater. 
Mary Ann was hired by Penn State in 
April 1976 and has served the university 
with distinction for 45 years. She 
joined the Office of Government and 
Community Relations, OGCR, in 1996 
and has served as executive assistant 
through two vice president transitions. 
Penn State OGCR is the office elect-
ed officials contact to interact with the 
university’s world-class scientific re-
searchers and talented students as well 
as its senior leaders. Mary Ann always 
handled her duties with grace and pro-
fessionalism. Her institutional memory 
and understanding of the university 
have been critical to serving Penn 
State’s external stakeholders at the 
Federal, State, local, and Tribal gov-
ernmental levels. 
Mary Ann has been the glue that held 
OGCR together over the years. She has 
been a model and mentor to numerous 
staff and student interns. Her knowl-
edge and expertise helped strengthen 
the OGCR team to advance the mis-
sion, vision, and goals of Penn State 
University. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in thank-
ing Mary Ann Chavey for her extraor-
dinary service to Penn State Univer-
sity and a congratulations on her re-
tirement.

UPHOLDING THE LAWS OF THE 
LAND 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in 
this holiday season, a time of joy, 
there are still families who are mourn-
ing the tragedy of loss of their beau-
tiful, precious students in Oakland 
County, Michigan. What a suffering 
time. 
In this place where our voices speak 
volumes, two Members decided to show 
their holiday spirit by exhibiting their 
families with any manner of weapons, 
AK–47s and otherwise, automatic weap-
ons. 
How they thought that this was the 
volume that should be heard from this 
place, I do not know. But I really con-
demn this kind of attitude and this 
kind of volume that generates into vio-
lence. 
We have a responsibility as we take 
an oath in this place to not only up-
hold the laws of the land but to be role 
models for the American people. Guns 
in the holiday season in the midst of 
precious souls who died—enough is 
enough. 
Pass real gun safety laws and pass 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
Elections count. Enough is enough. Let 
us act like those who have taken an 
oath to serve this Nation.

SYNTHETIC OPIOID OVERDOSE 
DEATHS CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today saddened as deaths involving 
synthetic opioids continue to sky-
rocket. 
In my district, in Pasco County, 
Florida, 193 people have died from 
fentanyl overdose since January. I 
have also received hundreds of heart-
breaking 
stories 
from 
constituents 
whose families have been devastated by 
addiction. 
One constituent, MaryAnne said: ‘‘I 
lost my son in June of 2021 to a 
fentanyl overdose. The system failed 
me in every single way. With open bor-
ders, enough fentanyl came pouring 
into our country’s southern border to 
kill 70 percent of our population. 
Sadly, my son is one of those statis-
tics.’’ Parents like MaryAnne are the 
faces of the fentanyl crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, the tragedies these fam-
ilies have experienced are the reason 
why we must fight back. We must se-
cure our borders, Mr. Speaker. We 
must place fentanyl-related substances 
into schedule I, and we must hold 
China accountable.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to:

SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, at the 
beginning of December, I said the Sen-
ate had a lot of hard work to do in 
order to address several critical prior-
ities before the end of the year. 
When the month began, America 
knew we had to avoid a government 
shutdown; we had to approve our an-
nual Defense bill; we had to preserve 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States; take action on Build Back Bet-
ter before Christmas, as well as deal 
with voting rights. 
It is now December 8, and the Senate 
is making very good progress on all of 
these priorities. It was a big, big agen-
da, and we are clearly not through with 
it, but we are making good progress. 
There is clearly light at the end of the 
tunnel on the debt ceiling and the De-
fense bill based on the agreement Lead-
er MCCONNELL and I came to and the 
House’s action last night. Let me go 
over those details. 
Last night, the House of Representa-
tives sent us two important pieces of 
legislation. One of them is a com-
promise version of our annual Defense 
bill, which I expect will earn bipartisan 
support in this Chamber in the coming 
days. 
I want to thank my colleagues, espe-
cially Senator REED, Ranking Member 
INHOFE, and all my colleagues, who 
worked to shape this legislation to help 
us make sure we pass a bipartisan De-
fense bill this year, as we have done for 
decades. 
The second bill they sent us will en-
able the Chamber to swiftly address 
the debt limit, sparing our country 
from the calamity—and a calamity it 
would have been—of a first-ever default 
on our national debt. This fast-tracked 
process was included in a bill that will 
also provide critical protections for 
Medicare funding, preventing slashes 
in that very important funding to so 
many seniors, and waive the pay-go 
rule to avoid harmful cuts. 
Last night, I took the first proce-
dural step to advance this legislation, 
setting up a cloture vote to take place 
as soon as Thursday. Once our proposal 
is approved by the Senate, we will be 
able to address the debt limit in this 
Chamber with a simple majority vote, 
which is exactly what Democrats have 
been seeking for months and what I 
have been asking for at this podium 
time after time, after time. 
I want to thank the Republican lead-
er for his help in working with us to 
find a responsible path that avoids par-
tisan brinksmanship. 
Democrats have always said that the 
Senate should be able to raise the debt 
limit without resorting to a con-
voluted, lengthy, and risky reconcili-
ation process, and under our plan, we 
won’t have to do that. 
Democrats have also said repeatedly 
that the responsible thing to do is to 
raise the debt ceiling. Both Democrats 
and Republicans voted for the spending 
increase. We have said repeatedly that

December 8, 2021 
we are ready to shoulder this burden 
even if our Republican colleagues are 
not going to be able to. It now looks 
like we will be able to do that—to have 
50 Democrats vote responsibly and do 
what is good for the Nation, avoiding 
catastrophe by raising the debt ceiling 
to pay the debts we have already in-
curred, just like any household must 
do. 
This agreement we have secured is 
the 
responsible 
path 
forward. 
No 
gamesmanship on the debt limit means 
no default on our sovereign debt and 
the calamity—the calamity—that it 
would cause. 
Again, I thank my Republican col-
leagues and Leader MCCONNELL. We 
have had fruitful, honest, and good dis-
cussions over the last several weeks to 
come up with this proposal. 
We are not over the finish line yet, 
but I want to thank all of my col-
leagues for working in good faith to 
move forward on this responsibility 
that must be addressed in the coming 
days. Soon, we will be able to cross an-
other major item off our December to- 
do list. And we have more to roll up 
our sleeves and get working on. They 
are so important. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Build 
Back Better: So, in the first few days 
of December, we have successfully 
avoided a government shutdown. We 
have cleared the path, hopefully, for 
addressing the debt limit; and, as I 
mentioned, I am optimistic that the 
NDAA will soon be settled. 
None of these are easy accomplish-
ments, but we are clearing the path for 
Democrats to turn to our biggest do-
mestic priority of the year: passing 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
Act before Christmas. 
Later today, four Senate committees 
will release the final texts of their por-
tions of Build Back Better, along with 
CBO scores for each, as required by the 
reconciliation process. Those four com-
mittees are Commerce, Small Business, 
Banking and Housing, and Veterans’ 
Affairs. 
In the meantime, I continue to hold 
daily conversations with my Demo-
cratic 
colleagues, 
with 
the 
White 
House, with the Speaker, and House 
colleagues. We continue to make good 
progress, and we are still on track to 
vote on a final product before Christ-
mas. The sooner we can pass Build 
Back Better, the better off American 
families will be as we start the new 
year. 
This bill has always been about a 
simple goal: cutting costs for working 
and middle-class families. 
People are complaining about higher 
costs. They are right to do that. This 
bill actually lowers costs in many dif-
ferent areas and will help families who 
are trying to make ends meet and 
stretch those dollars. Let me give you 
some examples. 
Families are still struggling to pull 
themselves out of a once-in-a-century 
economic 
crisis 
brought 
about 
by 
COVID. They want to pay less for 
things like healthcare, prescription 
drugs, childcare—some of the biggest 
costs average middle-income and work-
ing families have. They want us to find 
ways to make that happen, and that is 
exactly what Build Back Better does. 
America, if you want lower costs, tell 
your Senators to vote for Build Back 
Better. 
If we invest in American families, 
then we make it easier for them to 
work, to be productive, to flourish in 
society, and that makes our country 
stronger and lowers costs in the long 
term. 
One of the great problems, we are 
told, is a shortage of workers. One of 
the greatest reasons for the shortage of 
workers is the lack of good childcare. 
People can’t go to work if they have to 
look after their kids. And in this post- 
COVID era, a lot of the patterns that 
used to happen don’t happen anymore. 
Making childcare affordable will help 
bring people back to work, get our 
economy humming along again, and 
deal with some of the bottlenecks in 
certain areas, from certain industries, 
which is creating inflation. 
Helping families afford childcare, of 
course, saves parents money, but it 
goes a long way to alleviating our 
labor shortage. If parents don’t have to 
worry about how they will keep their 
kids safe during the day, they will have 
greater flexibility to reenter the work-
force and increase the country’s out-
put. That lowers inflation. 
In the long term, everyone wins— 
kids, parents, employers, and the en-
tire economy. This single investment 
alone is enough reason to keep pushing 
Build Back Better, but there are so 
many. 
One of the greatest costs we face is 
prescription drug costs. That is what 
families complain about above all. This 
bill goes a long way to making pre-
scription drugs cost less. 
Another great cost people are com-
plaining about is the rising cost of 
housing. This bill puts more money 
into housing—into both rehabilitating 
housing that has deteriorated and put-
ting them back into the marketplace 
in a real way and into creating new 
housing. It will reduce the dramatic in-
crease in housing costs. 
So you want to talk about inflation, 
you want to talk about people having 
to pay more, this bill is an antidote in 
so many areas. I have mentioned 
childcare, healthcare, and housing, just 
to name a few, but there are many oth-
ers as well. 
So we are going to keep working in 
getting this bill done. It is so impor-
tant to working families and to Amer-
ica. To working families: less expenses, 
easier to make that dollar stretch 
when we sit down Friday night after 
dinner and say, ‘‘How are we going to 
pay the bills this week?’’ To America: 
relieving bottlenecks and making sure 
that our economy hums along at a 
rapid rate, where people are getting 
good wages, but the bottlenecks caused 
often by COVID are reduced. 
f 
VACCINES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, one 
more 
issue—the 
upcoming 
vaccine 
CRA. 
On 
another 
matter, 
reports 
this 
morning indicate that getting vac-
cinated and boosted offer significant 
protection against the Omicron vari-
ant. 
As we learn more about Omicron, it 
is an important moment for national 
leaders to double- and triple-down on 
encouraging all eligible Americans to 
get vaccinated and boosted as soon as 
possible. 
But as soon as today, our Republican 
friends are going to come to the floor 
to push an anti-science, anti-vaccine 
proposal to overturn the President’s 
vaccines requirements for businesses 
with more than 100 employees. 
My friends, America, we are in the 
middle of a public health crisis. Every-
one sees the damage it causes to them-
selves, their friends, their families, and 
their communities, and the way to 
solve this is to be driven by science. 
We have had hundreds of years of sci-
entific advancement. It has helped us 
live longer and live healthier. My dad 
just lived until 98. That didn’t happen 
in a vacuum, and it certainly wouldn’t 
have happened when there were sci-
entific advances and people said, ‘‘Let’s 
not listen to them,’’ for political, ideo-
logical, or whatever reasons. We can-
not go back to the days when people 
were driven by wild theories. 
Some of the anti-vaxxers here in this 
Chamber remind me of what happened 
400 
years 
ago, 
when 
people 
were 
clinging to the fact that the Sun re-
volved around the Earth—they just 
didn’t believe science—or 300 years ago 
or 500 years ago, when they were sure 
the Earth was flat. It is just like that. 
The science is here. And what does 
the science show? The more people who 
get vaccinated, the greater chance we 
have to eliminate and, certainly, great-
ly 
reduce 
the 
virulence 
and 
‘‘widespreadness’’ of this disease. 
People are resisting. Is it political? Is 
it fueled by lies on the internet? Is it 
just because people fear vaccines? We 
never had this outcry when we had to 
give our kids—my kids—mumps, mea-
sles vaccines before they went to 
school. We never had this outcry as 
people lined up to get flu shots. 
All of a sudden, something has hap-
pened here. It is wrong, and it is bad 
for the country, and it is not based on 
any scientific evidence whatsoever. 
I know that wild stories on the inter-
net, lies, sometimes get in people’s 
heads, but we can’t listen to people’s 
lies. We are a fact-based society. We al-
ways have been. 
The biggest thing standing between 
us and the end of the pandemic is 
Americans who have refused to get vac-
cinated. Too many Americans believe a 
wide 
range 
of 
conspiracy 
theories

about vaccines, and even those who 
seem to encourage those crazy theories 
often get vaccinated themselves and 
don’t tell anybody. We have had so 
many of these hard-right leaders ad-
mitting: ‘‘Oh, yes, I did get vac-
cinated,’’ even though they are telling 
people they shouldn’t have to take one. 
‘‘Oh, yes, I will get vaccinated, but you 
shouldn’t have to.’’ 
If the only damage were to the per-
son, him or herself, who didn’t get vac-
cinated, maybe some people would say 
that is OK. But it is not just to them 
because, when there is a large pool of 
people unvaccinated, even if it is not 
the majority, that allows the COVID 
virus to spread, to mutate, to create 
new variants, and create new stronger 
variants. It is a pool of people. If you 
greatly reduce that pool, you greatly 
reduce the chance of a new variant, 
particularly a virulent one, from af-
flicting us in the months ahead. It is 
crazy. 
The internet has had a role in spread-
ing this, and so has the far right. The 
same people in the far right who want 
to tear down government and hurt 
working people in so many other ways 
are here doing the same thing—the 
same thing—even though, as I said, a 
good number of them get vaccinated 
themselves—hypocrisy. 
There should be one message, and one 
message only, coming from this Cham-
ber to the American people: Get vac-
cinated. Get boosted. Stay safe your-
self. Keep your families, your commu-
nities, and our country safe. 
The worst thing we can do is tie our 
own hands behind our backs and let 
these new variants spread and grow— 
new ones after Omicron and so many 
others. But that is what Republican- 
pushed ‘‘anti-vaccines’’ would do. 
I will strongly vote against this 
amendment. I have strong feelings 
about what is good for this country and 
about fighting anti-science and theo-
ries that seem to, as I said, come from 
the same place that the flat Earth the-
ory came from, that the theory that 
the Sun revolves around the Earth 
came from. Anti-science, nonscience, 
fictional belief come from there. We 
ought not give it a stamp of approval 
in this Chamber. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
Washington Democrats, 2021 will have 
one major theme: ramming through in-
flationary spending on a partisan basis 
that hurts American families and actu-
ally helps China. That is how this all- 
Democratic 
Government 
began 
the 
year, jamming through a wasteful ex-
cuse for a stimulus bill that drove up 
prices and made supply chain problems 
even worse. Not a single Republican 
supported it, and Democrats now want 
to end the year with another massive 
spree that would make it even worse. 
The whole country understands that 
Democrats own this mess. They have 
seized one-party control of the econ-
omy. So you better believe that they 
will have one-party accountability for 
the resulting nightmare. 
The President and his allies are badly 
upside down in overall approval rat-
ings, upside down on the generic ballot, 
upside down on the economy. And the 
more the men and women of this coun-
try learn about the reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree that Democrats are 
planning next, the less they want it or 
anything close to it. 
Democrats have wanted to transform 
the country alone. They want to print 
and borrow trillion after trillion on 
their own. They want to create even 
more inflation on their own. So, as the 
Republicans 
have 
made 
clear 
for 
months, they will have to own a debt 
ceiling increase as well. This week, the 
House and Senate have reached a bipar-
tisan agreement to make that happen. 
As the Democratic leader said yester-
day, the Democrats are ‘‘willing to 
carry the burden.’’ And so they will. 
We have reached an agreement on a 
one-time, one-shot statutory process 
that will enable Democrats to raise the 
debt limit at a fixed dollar amount, 
which they will specify. Much like the 
vote on an arms sales resolution that 
occurred yesterday and the Congres-
sional Review Act vote that will occur 
today, this will be a standard expedited 
process, at a simple majority thresh-
old, established by law. Democrats will 
get one shot at this. They won’t be able 
to add any other amendments. And 
every single Senate Democrat will 
have to put their name to the gigantic 
dollar amount of debt they are pre-
pared to pile on the American people. 
f 
VACCINES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on another matter, for the past 2 
years, as the country has battled 
COVID–19, I have been a strong and 
consistent advocate of following the 
science and taking precautions. That 
has included strong support for the safe 
and effective vaccines that have helped 
millions of Americans substantially 
lower their risk of death or serious ill-
ness. I took advantage of these modern 
medical miracles as soon as I could. I 
have received a booster. I have encour-
aged Kentuckians and all Americans to 
take full advantage as well. I have re-
corded public service announcements. 
I am a survivor of childhood polio. I 
have watched vaccines obliterate polio 
in our entire country in my lifetime. 
Trust me, there is no bigger proponent 
of vaccination than I am. But here is 
the thing: The United States of Amer-
ica is a free country. The Federal Gov-
ernment, elites in Washington, cannot 
micromanage citizens’ personal choices 
without a legitimate basis in law and 
the Constitution. And that goes double 
for Presidents going far beyond the 
bounds of their office and their author-
ity. 
President Biden’s absurd private-sec-
tor vaccine mandate is blatant over-
reach. It is illegal. The administration 
has already lost in Federal court and 
had it blocked. 
Washington Democrats have lashed 
themselves to a mast that is very sim-
ple: Unvaccinated people should be 
fired. That is what they want. They 
don’t trust individuals, families, doc-
tors, employers, and customers to sort 
things out for themselves. They want 
every worker at a medium-sized busi-
ness and up to either get the shot or 
get fired by President Biden. And bur-
ied in the illegal mandate is a call to 
explore whether it should expand to all 
businesses. 
This is not how things work in our 
country, 
period. 
Workers 
are 
not 
happy. Medium-sized businesses are not 
happy, especially not in the middle of 
this worker shortage. And, frankly, no-
body who understands our system of 
government is happy. 
I have heard from so many Kentuck-
ians who are affected by the adminis-
tration’s suite of several unwise vac-
cine mandates. Here is one quote: 
My wife . . . was notified that if she 
doesn’t get fully vaccinated by January 4 
then she would be terminated and lose her 
job without severance or unemployment. . . . 
She has been [there] for 17 years and has 
nothing but exemplary reviews. 
Here is another: 
I will lose my job at the Paducah Gaseous 
Diffusion Plant. I very much enjoyed my 
work there and had every intention of retir-
ing from the plant. However, due to Joe 
Biden’s forced vaccine mandate, I will be ter-
minated. . . . Please let a man who wants to 
work, go to work. 
Here is another: 
My firm [of] 103 employees will [either] 
lose about 25 to the mandate, or lay off 4 to 
get to 99. Which one should we do? 
Remember, personally, I would en-
courage each of these Kentuckians to 
get the vaccine, but for the purposes of 
this conversation, that really isn’t the 
point. You better believe I am going to 
stand up and fight for their freedom. 
I want to thank the junior Senator 
from Indiana for spearheading this res-
olution to overturn the Biden adminis-
tration’s illegal mandate. I am a proud 
cosponsor. I will proudly vote for it and 
urge every Senator to do the same.

NOMINATION OF RACHAEL S. 
ROLLINS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, the national mur-
der rate just recorded its biggest jump 
in more than a century. In some cities, 
homicides have set alltime records. 
From 
Albuquerque 
to 
Milwaukee, 
Memphis to Des Moines, city officials 
reported more murders last year than 
in any prior year. In my hometown of 
Louisville, homicides this year have 
now broken last year’s alltime record.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9004 
December 8, 2021 
All last year, liberal politicians and 
activists made absurd and false claims 
about law enforcement. Here are some 
of them: ‘‘We need to completely dis-
mantle’’ local police. Here is another 
one: ‘‘Policing in our country is inher-
ently and intentionally racist.’’ 
A leftwing messaging campaign has 
spent a year and a half trying to chill 
law enforcement and policing. A net-
work 
of 
liberal 
district 
attorneys 
around the country is matching their 
rhetoric with incredibly soft-on-crime 
practices behind the scenes, and the 
predictable result of all this has been a 
collapse—a collapse—in public safety. 
For example, last month a man 
killed six people and injured dozens 
more at a Christmas market in Wis-
consin—listen to this—just weeks after 
he was released on bail for another set 
of violent charges. This criminal had 
already been arrested and locked up in 
neighboring Milwaukee County, but he 
was let out by a liberal DA who re-
marked several years ago: 
Is there going to be an individual I divert, 
or I put into treatment program, who’s going 
to go out and kill somebody? You bet. Guar-
anteed. It’s guaranteed to happen. It does 
not invalidate the overall approach. 
Stunning. There are now a whole 
bunch of grieving families in this Wis-
consin city who have strong feelings 
about that ‘‘approach.’’ 
Here is a headline from New York 
City just this week: 
Man busted for assault set free, allegedly 
beats two random [New York City] women— 
then cut loose again. 
Smash-and-grabs, flash mob thefts, 
and carjackings are increasingly facts 
of life in multiple major cities, but 
against this backdrop, Democrats just 
want to keep getting weaker on crime 
and softer on public safety. 
We expect a vote today on the nomi-
nation of Rachael Rollins to be U.S. at-
torney for Massachusetts. Ms. Rollins 
has spent years in her current job as a 
DA pushing the idea that the State 
should wipe entire categories of crimes 
off the list of things worth prosecuting. 
She would rather her office not go after 
trespassers, shoplifters, or even those 
found possessing drugs with intent to 
distribute. This soft-on-crime advocacy 
should have earned the nominee a pink 
slip. Instead, President Biden is giving 
her a promotion. 
I would urge all Senators to vote no. 
Law-abiding 
Americans 
don’t 
want 
prosecutors who refuse to prosecute. 
They don’t want city jails equipped 
with revolving doors. And they need 
leaders who will defend the rule of law. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Washington. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today, as I have done too many times 
before and as my colleague Senator 
MURPHY did just last week, to reiterate 
what people across my home State and 
the entire country have been calling 
for for years now, calling for us to take 
action here in the Senate to end the 
crisis of gun violence that we are see-
ing in our schools, in our neighbor-
hoods, and across our country. 
Last week, we mourned the deaths of 
four high school students following the 
tragic shooting at Oxford High School 
in Michigan. My heart goes out to 
those 
four 
students’ 
families 
and 
friends, and my heart goes out to every 
student at Oxford High who is now car-
rying the trauma of that experience. 
My heart breaks for every student in 
this country who grows up thinking 
something like this will eventually 
happen to them at their school, and my 
heart hurts for every parent who wor-
ries every time they send their kid off 
to school because—let’s face it—school 
shootings are a very real threat in this 
country. 
As a parent and a grandparent and a 
former 
preschool 
teacher, 
I 
know 
school is supposed to be a place where 
our children feel safe, where they can 
go to learn and grow and see friends, 
where they can be kids, but after weeks 
like last week, that feeling disappears, 
following school shootings like the one 
we saw in Michigan or threats to 
schools like we saw last week in my 
home State of Washington. 
Just last week, my hometown high 
school, Bothell High School, was shut 
down over concerns about a threat of 
violence. Ferndale High School was in 
lockdown Wednesday because of a 
threat of a gun on campus. That same 
Wednesday, the day after the shooting 
in Michigan, threats were made tar-
geting 
three 
schools 
in 
Mukilteo 
School District, forcing local law en-
forcement to mobilize resources and 
personnel—all of that in just 1 week. 
While, luckily, none of those threats 
we saw in my home State escalated 
any further thanks in large part to the 
quick work of local officials, in the 
same week, Seattle saw six shootings 
in just over 24 hours. From January 
through October of this year, Seattle 
has already seen more than 500 shoot-
ing incidents. It is already the most 
shootings the city has seen in the last 
decade. 
I am not the only one who thinks 
this cannot continue. I know because 
for years I have heard from students 
and teachers and parents from my 
State who want major Federal action 
to finally end the gun violence epi-
demic in this country. People want an 
end to these school shootings, an end 
to shootings at our churches and places 
of worship, an end to the shootings at 
our malls and stores, and an end to the 
gun violence that doesn’t always make 
the news but happens on our streets 
and in our neighborhoods. 
As Senator MURPHY said last week, 
we are the only high-income nation in 
the world where this happens. But it 
happens because we let it happen be-
cause, despite how many times my 
Democratic colleagues and I have come 
to the floor with commonsense, pop-
ular legislation to help prevent gun vi-
olence, 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
block us from even debating those 
bills, let alone voting on them. Think 
about that. They won’t even allow a 
debate on this legislation that could 
save lives. 
So I ask them: How many times are 
we going to go through this cycle? 
What will you tell parents in this coun-
try when they ask you what you did to 
stop the next school shooting? How 
many times will you refuse to even de-
bate commonsense steps to keep our 
communities safe? 
It is past time Republicans either get 
on board with taking action to stop 
these shootings or at least get out of 
the way. Like so many parents or 
grandparents, I want to stop worrying 
if our kids are safe in school. And like 
so many Americans, I am done with my 
Republican colleagues blocking com-
monsense gun laws at every turn. 
At this point, you are either in favor 
of taking action to help put an end to 
these shootings or you are against 
them. 
Washington can and should continue 
to build on its gun safety laws. The ad-
ministration can and should continue 
to invest in community violence inter-
vention programs. But here is the deal: 
We can’t address the full scope of the 
gun violence epidemic in this country 
without taking major Federal action. 
Universal background checks, an as-
sault weapons ban, and a patchwork of 
gun safety laws are simply not ade-
quate. We need Federal laws in place in 
order to protect our families. 
The fact that one party has listened 
to the voices of parents across the 
country and taken to the floor once 
again to call for an end to gun violence 
while the other listens to the gun lobby 
and stays silent in the face of repeated 
tragedy speaks volumes. Simply put, 
our kids and grandkids deserve to be 
safe from gun violence in their schools 
and on our streets. 
I refuse to let Republican obstruction 
continue to get in the way of common-
sense measures that will save lives. All 
options need to be on the table. It is 
time we restore the Senate to make 
sure this institution can actually serve 
the interests of the vast majority of 
the American public. 
So I promise all parents, all the 
grandparents, everyone in Washington 
State that, despite the obstruction and 
silence from my Republican colleagues, 
I will not stay quiet, and I will keep 
pushing for change. And I hope the 
American people will do the same. 
I yield the floor.

publican whip.

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Ameri-
cans are currently dealing with the 
worst inflation in more than 30 years— 
high grocery prices, high rent prices, 
high gas prices, high car prices, in-
creases in the price of household goods, 
and the list goes on. Inflation is so bad 
that it has outstripped wage growth,

S9005 
December 8, 2021 
resulting in a de facto pay cut for 
many Americans. 
One of the price hikes hitting Ameri-
cans hard is the increase in the price of 
gas. Gas prices have risen 40 percent 
since President Biden took office—40 
percent. That takes a tremendous toll 
on family budgets. And, of course, high 
gas prices and other energy costs con-
tribute to price increases on a whole 
host of other goods. Manufacturers fac-
ing higher transportation costs thanks 
to high gas prices, for example, are 
likely to pass on at least some of those 
increased costs to consumers in the 
form of price hikes. 
In my home State of South Dakota, 
families are facing an increase in home 
heating costs as high as 50 to 100 per-
cent, depending on how severe of a win-
ter we face. 
Nationwide, concerns over high heat-
ing costs this winter have been tem-
pered by mild weather so far, but pre-
dictions of huge energy bills could re-
turn with a period of sustained harsh 
weather. And that would be another fi-
nancial blow for families whose budg-
ets are already severely stretched by 
our current inflation crisis. 
It is easy for, say, a wealthy Demo-
crat politician to dismiss the con-
sequences of inflation, but for families 
living paycheck to paycheck, an in-
crease in the grocery bill or heating 
costs or the cost of a tank of gas could 
mean tough decisions, like choosing 
between adequately heating the house 
or filling the car to get to a job. 
So what has President Biden been 
doing to help alleviate rising energy 
prices and inflation? Well, the answer 
is not much. First, he pleaded with the 
OPEC cartel to increase oil production 
and increase global supply, which is 
the single most influential factor when 
it comes to gas prices. OPEC was 
unmoved. 
Then the President recently an-
nounced the release of 50 million bar-
rels of oil from the Strategic Petro-
leum Oil Reserve, a move that Con-
gress had, in part, already mandated. 
Unfortunately, this is nothing more 
than a short-term relief measure, if 
that, as it will do little to give our en-
ergy sector the certainty it is seeking 
to bring production and American en-
ergy jobs back online. 
While Democrats helped create the 
inflation crisis that we are experi-
encing by flooding the economy with 
unnecessary government money earlier 
this year, the President is not solely to 
blame for high energy prices, which 
have also been driven up by COVID-re-
lated issues. However, the President is 
certainly to blame for the hostile atti-
tude his administration has displayed 
toward conventional energy produc-
tion. And he is certainly to blame for 
the reckless tax-and-spending spree he 
is pushing, which would further drive 
up energy prices for American families. 
The President made clear that his at-
titude toward conventional energy pro-
duction on day 1 of his administration, 
when he canceled the Keystone XL 
Pipeline, an environmentally respon-
sible pipeline project that was already 
underway and that would have deliv-
ered more than 10,000 construction jobs 
and helped decrease energy costs by in-
creasing regional energy supply, all 
while being offset with a $1.7 billion in-
vestment in renewable energy. 
The President also almost imme-
diately banned new oil and gas leases 
on Federal lands, sending a clear signal 
to oil and gas producers that his ad-
ministration would be reluctant to 
work with them to increase American 
energy production. 
Then, of course, there was the release 
of the first outlines of the President’s 
reckless tax-and-spending plan, which 
displayed a clear hostility to conven-
tional energy. 
Given this record, it is no surprise 
that many energy producers have been 
less than enthusiastic about coming 
fully back online as we emerge from 
the pandemic. The market signals to 
increase production are being muted by 
this administration’s burdensome poli-
cies and clear intent of sidelining 
American energy development. 
Then there is the current version of 
the reckless tax-and-spending spree, 
which Democrats are pushing to pass 
in the very near future. This legisla-
tion will not only likely worsen our 
current inflation situation, it will also 
make our energy less reliable and more 
expensive. 
If Democrats succeed in passing their 
legislation, 
American 
families 
will 
have to brace themselves for even high-
er energy bills. One major driver of 
those higher energy bills will be the 
bill’s new fee—or tax—on methane, 
which is targeted at crippling the nat-
ural gas sector that spurred America’s 
recent energy renaissance and has ac-
tually been the largest driver of coal 
displacement. 
The American Gas Association says 
the proposed fee could add as much as 
34 percent to natural gas bills. And 
that is on top of any increases Ameri-
cans may already be facing. 
As I mentioned earlier, home heating 
bills are already projected to rise as 
much as 50 to 100 percent in my State 
this winter—and that is without the 
reckless tax-and-spending spree piling 
on. 
And if progressive Democrats have 
their way, Democrats’ tax-and-spend-
ing spree could also penalize our oil 
and gas sector by ending longstanding 
tax provisions like the percentage de-
pletion deduction, which underpins an 
overwhelming number of independent 
producers representing roughly 90 per-
cent of wells drilled in the United 
States. 
Simply 
put, 
this 
administration 
wants to make it more expensive and 
more difficult to develop our abundant 
energy resources in favor of their pre-
ferred energy technologies and electric 
vehicles, with predictable consequences 
for Americans’ pocketbooks. 
And just a word about those electric 
vehicles. The President’s Transpor-
tation Secretary recently suggested 
that families feeling the pinch of high 
gas prices could solve their problem by 
buying an electric vehicle, which would 
allow them to ‘‘never have to worry 
about gas prices again.’’ 
Well, I have news for the President’s 
Transportation Secretary. A lot of 
Americans can’t afford to replace their 
car with an electric vehicle, not to 
mention that electric cars and trucks 
are still not a practical option for 
many Americans for other reasons. 
Secretary Buttigieg’s statement shows 
just how far out of touch Democrats 
have become with ordinary Americans. 
I know Democrats are deeply in-
vested in their Green New Deal fan-
tasies of an instant, mostly electric en-
ergy regime. But the reality is that 
American consumers will need to use 
liquid fuels and electricity and heat for 
natural gas well into the future. And 
punishing or discouraging responsible 
energy development in oil and natural 
gas 
will 
do 
nothing—nothing—but 
drive up energy prices for consumers 
and force our Nation to rely more on 
oil and gas imports from unstable areas 
of the world. 
We should be encouraging American 
energy development of every kind— 
from oil and natural gas to wind, solar, 
and biofuels—not artificially picking 
winners and losers and discouraging es-
sential energy production. 
And with American consumers strug-
gling with long-term inflation, the last 
thing we need to be doing right now is 
passing legislation that will drive up 
energy prices. Unfortunately, if Demo-
crats have their way and succeed in 
passing their tax-and-spending legisla-
tion, Americans will soon be able to 
add even higher energy bills to the list 
of challenges that they are currently 
facing. 
So much for building back better for 
the American people.

ENERGY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, while I 
am on the topic of energy, I would like 
to briefly comment on yesterday’s an-
nouncements from the EPA and USDA 
concerning biofuels. To put it simply, 
the administration can’t have it both 
ways on the renewable fuel standard, 
something agriculture stakeholders in 
South Dakota know all too well. 
Yesterday, the EPA announced a pro-
posal to take the unprecedented step of 
clawing back previously set biofuel 
blending targets; 2020 volumes would be 
reduced by 21⁄2 billion gallons, and 2021 
would see a reduction. 
Now, the EPA is trying to sell this by 
simultaneously proposing an increase 
in the 2022 blending volumes, which on 
its own would be favorable, but it is far 
from enough to make up for the lost 
gallons. 
And keep in mind that the EPA’s 
proposal pulls back blending obliga-
tions from a final rule, giving stake-
holders little confidence that this 
promised 2022 increase won’t meet the

same fate. Again, not every component 
of yesterday’s announcement is bad on 
its own. 
Signaling an end to the out-of-con-
trol small refinery exemption program 
is long overdue, and it is consistent 
with the renewable fuel standard and a 
Tenth Circuit Court ruling. It is also 
good to see the Department of Agri-
culture moving forward with assistance 
funds for biofuel producers, but this 
was funding signed into law last De-
cember. It is almost as if it was with-
held from our producers for months so 
that USDA could help the EPA sell our 
ag stakeholders a bill of goods. 
I urge the administration to make 
good on its commitments to our farm-
ers and to finally leverage American 
biofuels for the energy and environ-
mental solutions they can provide. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
f 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. DOLE 
Mr. 
MARSHALL. 
Mr. 
President, 
much is grown on Kansas’ plains. Crops 
and pastures stretch as far as the eye 
can see. Grain elevators replace city 
skyscrapers, and the whisper of the 
wind substitutes the screech of sirens 
and traffic. 
What truly makes the prairie special, 
however, is the people, the people of 
the plains. Kindness and resilience de-
fine Kansans. Churches that seem en-
tirely too big for the tiny towns they 
tower over are filled on Sundays; and 
neighbors are checking on each other, 
sharing food, sharing laughs, maybe 
sharing a cup of coffee and even a few 
beers. 
And perhaps this is why Senator Bob 
Dole reminded me every time I saw 
him: Roger, always remember where 
you are from. 
In every speech I ever heard him 
give, he always said: Always remember 
where you are from. 
I thought a lot about that this week. 
What was Senator Dole saying? Why 
was that so important? 
And I think, reflecting, he always 
wanted to make sure that he remem-
bered his Kansas values and that the 
people of Russell, KS, shaped his life, 
to pay honor to them and respect. 
This week, Kansans lost a great 
friend and neighbor. Senator Bob Dole, 
a personification of the gentle tough-
ness cultivated in the rural Midwest; 
an advocate for the disabled, the hun-
gry, our veterans and our American 
way of life; a genuine once-in-a-genera-
tion, from the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ 
American hero has been called home. 
It was to these same plains that a 
young Robert Dole returned from war, 
critically wounded from injuries sus-
tained in 1945 on a battlefield in Italy. 
The people of Russell had chipped in 
money—$1,800 to be exact—into a cigar 
box on the counter of Dawson’s Drug 
Store, where a young Bob Dole once 
worked as a soda jerk. These funds 
were used to help offset the costs of his 
recovery, and it was a grueling recov-
ery. During his 3-year hospital stay, he 
spent time in a body cast. He fought 
horrible infections that shot his tem-
perature to over 109 degrees, which 
forced the doctors to pack him in ice. 
He literally underwent dozens of sur-
geries on his shoulder, his arm, and 
even to remove a kidney. Bob Dole was 
once a strapping, muscular three-sport 
varsity athlete at Russell High School, 
as well as a KU Jayhawk athlete. Dole 
was now paralyzed and his weight had 
dropped to 122 pounds. 
All the while, during his recovery 
there in the hospitals, he listened to 
one of his new favorite songs, a source 
of inspiration, ‘‘You’ll Never Walk 
Alone.’’ I quote from that Rodgers and 
Hammerstein classic: 
Walk on with hope in your heart and you’ll 
never walk alone. 
Walk on with hope in your heart and you’ll 
never walk alone. 
Americans know of Bob Dole’s record 
of public service, whether it was pass-
ing the Reagan agenda through the 
Senate, saving Social Security from 
bankruptcy, fighting hunger in the 
United States and abroad, the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act, his work for 
veterans that includes the construction 
of the World War II Memorial, and so, 
so much more. 
Americans know of his time at the 
helm at the Republican National Com-
mittee, the U.S. Senate, and the par-
ty’s Presidential ticket. They may 
even be aware of when, in 2014, he re-
gained the strength to travel and vis-
ited all 105 Kansas counties to simply 
say ‘‘thank you’’—thank you—for the 
life they had given him. 
People may also know that most Sat-
urdays of the past decade, Senator Dole 
quietly sat on the south side of the 
World War II Memorial to greet and 
thank veterans as the Honor Flights 
came to Washington, DC. It was only 
fitting that Kansans gathered there 
this morning to pay homage and re-
spect and remember our hero. All of 
this, he did with humility, with charm 
and wit—that famous wit that made 
him so likable, so effective, and so 
Kansan. 
As we in the Capitol honor Senator 
Dole, I remember the days that fol-
lowed his famous salute of President 
George H.W. Bush’s casket in the Cap-
itol Rotunda—a moment that inspired 
and captivated the world—when he, 
with the help of his caretaker and fel-
low veteran Nate, stood up from his 
wheelchair and showed his reverence 
for his once rival and friend. He, of 
course, didn’t understand what the big 
deal was. He just wanted to honor a fel-
low veteran and public servant. It was 
just a reflex for him to show that re-
spect, and his humility in its wake was 
his classic style. 
I remember the morning earlier this 
spring when Senator Dole called me to 
tell me that he had stage IV lung can-
cer. He wanted to make sure that my 
wife Laina and I knew before the press 
did. But all the while, what I remember 
from that conversation was how upbeat 
he was, how positive he was, worried 
about me and not himself. 
But he, again, beat the odds and 
spent more quality time with all of us. 
And every time I saw him, even up to 
just a couple of weeks ago, he was al-
ways cracking jokes, imparting wis-
dom, and spending time with all of his 
friends. 
I am so grateful for the blessing of 
each moment spent with him before 
and after that call. I can’t express what 
I would give for another one of those 
moments, as I know is true for his wife, 
our friend, Senator Elizabeth; and his 
most steadfast supporter and advocate, 
his daughter Robin. 
The same goes for his devoted staff, 
who are like family to the Doles. 
Whenever you visited the Doles, that 
staff were all family members. I want 
to mention Pia, Marion, Mo, Ruth Ann, 
and so many more. We mourn your loss 
and you are in our prayers. 
There are so many scores of friends 
from all ages and so many walks of life. 
So many people reached out to me this 
week to say: We are thinking of you, 
we are praying for you, give the Dole 
family our condolences. 
Now, as his incredible work here is 
done—and I am going to miss my 
friend—the boots that my fellow Kan-
sas Senator and I have to fill are very 
large, but, fortunately, he left me with 
some good advice to fill those boots. 
It was in 2017, shortly after I had 
been elected and I was facing my first 
tough vote, and Senator Dole and my-
self were able to have a late morning 
brunch. I had my notes prepared. I was 
going to discuss this issue in great 
depth and I was prepared for every one 
of Senator Dole’s questions. 
But as I started the conversation, he 
said: Well, what is going on, on the 
Hill? 
I said: Senator Dole, I have a tough 
vote tomorrow. 
He took another sip of his lobster 
bisque and looked at me and said: 
Roger, go back to Kansas. The people 
of Kansas will tell you the answer. 
I know I am going to never measure 
up to his standard. He set a tremendous 
bar for us to reach. While Senator Dole 
is done, the lessons we can all learn 
from his life will be lived out and 
passed on. Certainly, the spirit of Bob 
Dole, the spirit of patriotism, hope, 
loyalty, respect, service, and genuine 
kindness and concern for others will 
never fade. 
One of the best days of my time in 
Congress was watching Senator Dole 
receive the Congressional Gold Medal 
in 2018, in our Nation’s Capitol Ro-
tunda. It was a special honor. As a 
freshman Congressman, I had to kind 
of fight my way to the front row or 
near the front row, and I was sur-
rounded by other Members of Congress 
as well. As the President recited Bob 
Dole’s story, one by one they would 
look at me and nod. You know that nod 
you get, the nod of respect. You don’t 
have to say anything. I was so proud to

be a Kansan. My chest puffed up, full of 
pride. It just made me so very proud to 
be there with the Kansans to see this is 
what a Congressman, a Senator, is sup-
posed to look like. 
For months, as we led up to that 
event, his family and friends watched 
as he struggled to regain strength after 
several more health setbacks. I remem-
ber the family didn’t think he would be 
able to attend, but much like the 
wounded Bob Dole in the forties, he 
was able to accept that award person-
ally. He miraculously recovered, like 
he had so many times before. 
At that marvelous ceremony where 
he got to hear the gratitude of a na-
tion, the song ″You’ll Never Walk 
Alone’’ was played. I was close enough 
that I could see him mouth the words 
to the President: ‘‘This is my favorite 
song.’’ And I was close enough that I 
could hear his voice—a voice we were 
all familiar with—sing along, softly 
sing these lyrics: 
When you walk through a storm 
Hold your head up high and don’t be afraid of 
the dark 
At the end of the storm there’s a golden sky 
and the sweet silver song of a lark 
Walk on through the wind 
Walk on through the rain 
Though your dreams be tossed and blown 
Walk on 
Walk on with hope in your heart and you’ll 
never walk alone 
You’ll never walk alone. 
For so many of us—Kansans, vet-
erans, the poor and hungry around the 
world, farmers, the disability commu-
nity, and more—we never walk alone. 
We thank you, Senator Dole, for walk-
ing beside us, always giving us hope. 
We love you, we miss you, and we 
thank you. 
God bless America.

Mr. CASSIDY. I ask unanimous con-

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, we 
have a crisis here in the United States, 
which we cannot keep ignoring. After 
the pandemic hit, we took our eyes off 
the issue of opioid and other drug 
overdoses. 
We have made tremendous progress 
over the previous 4 years. The Trump 
Administration made it a priority. 
Congress has made it a priority. We 
have funded multiple programs, and we 
have seen that the incidence rate of 
drug overdose was decreasing and for 
opioids in particular. 
But with the lockdown and the per-
sonal stress this led to, we have seen 
an uptick once more in these opioid 
deaths. From April 2020 to April 2021, 
we saw over 100,000 overdoses linked to 
opioids and other overdoses beyond 
that, and fentanyl causing 64 percent of 
them. 
Now, we talk about statistics, but we 
sometimes, in those statistics, lose the 
human dimension. I remember a 911 
call I once heard, and in it there was a 
frantic woman calling because her hus-
band was overdosed: Please come help. 
And that is tragic, but you almost be-
come used to it. What brought tears to 
your eyes was that in the background 
you heard the baby crying. 
Now, it is easy to imagine, one, what 
that child’s life is now—the child of an 
addict—but it is also easy to imagine 
what the child’s future is with a single 
parent having to deal with the death of 
a father and all that means. 
It is not just the opioid death. It is 
the opioid family that has to bear the 
burden of the loss: first, to addiction 
and then, secondly, to death. 
Now, there is a unique role here for 
the country of China. We don’t know 
that it is the Chinese Government, but 
we certainly know it is the country of 
China. 
Fentanyl is a synthetic poison that is 
taking the lives of so many of these 
who die from opioid addiction—cer-
tainly true in my State, Louisiana. 
The country of China’s role in this 
opioid crisis is by providing the chemi-
cals to the Mexican and South Amer-
ican cartels, which take those raw 
chemicals and make them into the 
fentanyl that then comes into our 
country. And this is what is causing 
the addiction. 
Now, by the way, opioid addiction is 
incredibly powerful. In another story 
from when I was a practicing physi-
cian, in the emergency room, at 3 in 
the morning, where the grandmother 
was there with the addict daughter, 
and the child—grandchild of the grand-
mother, child of the addict—was crying 
because the grandmother was taking 
the child away from his mother. The 
mother didn’t care. And it struck me 
that if something is so powerful to dis-
rupt the relationship between a mother 
and her child, the power of that cannot 
be ignored. 
So when we look at these drugs that 
people are addicted to, we have to un-
derstand the hold they have upon their 
physiology, their emotional life, their 
psychology—in a sum, their whole life. 
So what can we do? We can’t just 
give up. We have to make a pushback 
for the sake of those who are in addic-
tion and the family members that they 
have. So we need to modernize our cus-
toms process. I have a Customs Mod-
ernization Act, which will crack down 
on the illicit trade, if you will, the way 
that the cartels are financing and mov-
ing drugs across the border. If we can 
address that, we can address the sup-
ply, and we can decrease the number of 
people who have access to these drugs. 
Today, 
I 
introduce 
the 
HALT 
Fentanyl Act to make permanent the 
temporary 
schedule 
I 
of 
fentanyl 
analogs. What this means is that in an 
effort to evade our laws, the cartels 
will make some little analog—just a 
little 
bit 
different 
from 
regular 
fentanyl, 
which 
is 
regulated—but, 
nonetheless, has the addictive poten-
tial and the ability to kill of regular 
fentanyl. And this will allow us to 
combat the criminals and to hold the 
companies in China responsible. 
The next thing we have to do is start 
by closing down our southern border. It 
is not just the migrants who are com-
ing across but tens of thousands of 
pounds of drugs. We are now seizing 
more fentanyl and meth than we ever 
have before. Even the DEA Adminis-
trator, Anne Milgram, agrees that 
drugs flowing across the border are 
fueling the opioid crisis. 
She said this on national TV: ‘‘The 
real problem are the criminal drug net-
works in Mexico.’’ She says fentanyl 
and meth are being ‘‘mass produced in 
Mexico,’’ sourcing chemicals mostly 
coming from China, and they are ‘‘driv-
ing the overdose deaths’’. 
We have a responsibility to our fel-
low Americans. Perhaps I feel it more 
acutely as a physician who has been 
with those patients and their families 
who are fighting addiction, but we 
should all feel the pain of that child 
crying as her mother was calling for 
911 to come assist the father who had 
stopped breathing from an overdose. So 
let us redouble our efforts and hope 
others will join on both the Customs 
Modernization 
Act 
and

DEMOCRAT LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want 
to take just a few moments to go back 
to March of this year. After a very 
tough year fighting COVID–19, the 
American people had many reasons to 
be optimistic about the future. Mil-
lions of people were being vaccinated 
every day. The winter surge was fading 
away, and travel was slowly ramping 
up. Families were able to get back to-
gether who hadn’t seen their loved 
ones, particularly those who were the 
most vulnerable to the virus. People 
were able to visit face-to-face and re-
sume their lives, gradually discovering 
what I will call the new normal. 
We knew the war against the virus 
was not over, but our communities 
were well-resourced to keep up the 
fight, thanks to the five bipartisan 
bills that were signed into law in 2020. 
Yes, it is true. Just last year, we 
passed five bipartisan relief bills with 
broad 
bipartisan 
support—in 
some 
cases, unanimous consent support. My, 
how quickly things changed. After 
President Biden was sworn into office, 
our friends on the other side of the 
aisle began to view things quite dif-
ferently. 
Where 
Republicans 
saw 
progress, Democrats saw, as one House 
Member put it, a ‘‘tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure things to fit 
[their] vision.’’ Democrats tried to cap-
italize on the pandemic to check items 
off their liberal wish list. They crafted 
a nearly $2 trillion bill that included 
some of the far-left’s highest priorities 
and tried to brand it as pandemic re-
lief—backdoor 
funding 
for 
Planned 
Parenthood, a blank check for mis-
managed union pension funds, money 
for ‘‘climate justice’’—whatever that 
is. Less than 10 percent of the money 
for COVID–19 was directly related to 
the pandemic, and less than 1 percent 
supported vaccination efforts. 
In addition to being wasteful and ir-
responsible, this level of spending has 
brought with it serious risks. Leading 
economists who are Democrats, like 
Larry Summers and Steve Rattner, 
warn this level of spending could trig-
ger inflation. Most of the young people 
who were not alive during the seven-
ties, during the tremendous inflation 
in the country, have never experienced 
anything like that or even like what 
we are experiencing today. But Larry 
Summers presciently warned that this 
level of Federal spending could ‘‘set off 
[some] inflationary pressures of a kind 
we have not seen in a generation.’’ 
Still, 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
couldn’t be persuaded to change course. 
They moved forward with their near-
ly $2 trillion spending bill, and lo and 
behold, guess what happened. Well, 
Larry Summers was right, and the Fed-
eral Reserve that called inflation tran-
sitory was wrong. We are now experi-
encing inflation at a level we have not 
seen in a generation, exactly as Larry 
Summers predicted. 
In October, inflation hit a 31-year 
high. Consumer prices jumped 6.2 per-
cent compared with a year ago, making 
this the highest inflation rate we have 
seen since 1990. If you were to ask the 
average Texan if they were surprised 
by this news, they would say: Not at 
all. 
Month after month, families have ad-
justed their budgets as prices ticked 
up. They are now paying more for ev-
erything from gasoline to groceries, 
from cars to Christmas gifts. 
And our Democratic colleagues seem 
to think the only solution is to add 
more fuel to the fire. They put to-
gether a second partisan spending 
spree, which will cost approximately $5 
trillion. That has already passed the 
House of Representatives. 
Taxpayers will be disappointed by 
what they get for so much money: tax 
breaks for millionaires and billion-
aires—that is in the House bill—cuts to 
healthcare for low-income and unin-
sured patients, special favors for orga-
nized labor and union bosses, and tax-
payer-subsidized electric vehicles for 
the well-off. 
Our colleagues have worked dili-
gently, I must confess, on this bill all 
year, and this is what they have come 
up with. Meanwhile, they have ignored 
some of the most basic responsibilities 
of governing. 
So far, the Senate has not passed any 
regular appropriations bills. There are 
12 of them that routinely we pass. They 
are deliberated in the Appropriations 
Committee, voted on, on a bipartisan 
basis, and ultimately come to the floor 
and pass as part of the most basic func-
tion of governing. 
We haven’t done that this year. Our 
colleagues have delayed the National 
Defense Authorization Act, and we are 
just 1 week away from a deadline that 
Secretary Yellen has given us for a po-
tential debt crisis. Our colleagues have 
failed to do the bare minimum. 
Why on Earth are they pouring every 
ounce of their time and energy into 
this damaging partisan spending spree 
when they can’t even cover the fun-
damentals of governing?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9009 
December 8, 2021 
One thing is for sure: It is not be-
cause of a lack of opportunities to ad-
vance bipartisan legislation. 
In fact, over the last year, I have 
been proud to work with a number of 
our Democratic colleagues on legisla-
tion to address some of our biggest 
challenges, so it is not impossible. For 
example, Senator WARNER, the Senator 
from Virginia, and I have partnered on 
the CHIPS for America Act, which be-
came law earlier this year, and now we 
are working together to provide the 
funds to fund the programs that the 
bill created. 
Then there is Senator SINEMA, the 
senior Senator from Arizona. She and I 
teamed up on legislation to deal with 
the humanitarian crisis and security 
crisis at our border and to make sure 
that migrants are treated fairly and 
humanely. 
Senator PADILLA, the junior Senator 
from California, and I have worked to-
gether on legislation to make big in-
vestments in infrastructure projects 
across the country without increasing 
the deficit by a dime. 
Earlier this year, State and local 
governments received huge sums of 
COVID–19 
relief 
money—more 
than 
they could use—and they found them-
selves with more cash than they did el-
igible expenses. So the idea behind our 
bill was pretty simple: give State and 
local leaders more flexibility to invest 
in the most critical projects for their 
communities—largely, 
infrastructure 
and disaster relief. 
In some places, this still means pan-
demic-related expenses. We don’t re-
quire them to do anything; we just 
merely give them an option. Cities can 
continue to use Federal dollars to ex-
pand hospital bed capacities, increase 
staffing, or support vaccination cam-
paigns. 
The flexibility granted by this bill 
wouldn’t interfere with any plans to 
bolster the fight against the virus. It 
simply gives States and local govern-
ments the ability to invest excess fund-
ing in infrastructure projects: con-
structing bridges, extending railways, 
modernizing 
ports, 
expanding 
broadband. This particular bill includes 
a long list of qualifying expenses. 
State and local leaders know their 
communities best, and they should be 
able to use excess COVID–19 relief 
funds in a way that makes the most 
sense for their State and their commu-
nity. 
Senator PADILLA and I were happy to 
work with our colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to make changes to the bill 
to gain bipartisan support. We added 
additional 
qualifying 
infrastructure 
projects to ensure unique but no less 
important infrastructure projects in 
some States were eligible. And we 
placed a cap, working with the White 
House, on the amount of funding that 
could be used because of the White 
House’s concerns that it would take 
away from necessary COVID–19 ex-
penses. 
In October, this bill passed the Sen-
ate with unanimous support. Now, 
nothing passes this Senate with unani-
mous support without a lot of hard 
work and a lot of input from a lot of 
people on both sides of the aisle. At a 
time when something as simple as K–12 
curricula are controversial, the full 
Senate 
supported 
this 
legislation. 
Local officials, highway safety groups, 
and the transportation infrastructure 
construction industry all support this 
commonsense legislation. 
Leaders from three dozen organiza-
tions representing these groups sent a 
letter to House leaders earlier this 
week encouraging the bill’s passage. As 
they said, providing State and local 
leaders with flexible resources is the 
surest way to see that our Nation’s pre-
paredness and responsivity continue. 
And it is important to note that this 
money had already gone out the door, 
so all of these projects, all of this new 
infrastructure, can be funded without 
increasing the deficit by a dime. 
As I said, all 100 Senators supported 
this legislation, and the bill currently 
has more than 120 bipartisan cospon-
sors in the House. So we would encour-
age our House colleagues to delay no 
longer and take up and pass this com-
monsense, bipartisan bill. 
So my point is, even in times when 
we seem irreparably polarized, where 
some colleagues decide it is my way or 
the highway when it comes to trying to 
pass legislation in a 50–50 Senate— 
which is, admittedly, very hard to do— 
the truth of the matter is there are 
real opportunities to address some of 
the biggest challenges facing our coun-
try in a bipartisan way. 
But none of these opportunities are 
contained in the Democrats’ partisan 
spending bill. This legislation would, as 
Larry Summers predicted, continue to 
fuel the red-hot inflation that is al-
ready burning the American people. It 
will harm our energy security. It will 
give massive tax breaks to the wealthy 
while increasing taxes on the middle 
class. It cuts funding to our safety-net 
hospitals that provide charity care and 
care for Medicaid patients. And it will 
drive our national debt to unimagi-
nable heights. 
It will also hand the government con-
trol of decisions that should be made 
by 
families 
on 
everything 
from 
childcare to healthcare—basically hand 
those decisions to the Federal Govern-
ment. This is not the type of legisla-
tion that should be on our Senate’s 
agenda at all, let alone at the top of 
the list. 
There are plenty of opportunities to 
work together to notch big bipartisan 
wins for the American people. It is a 
shame, though, that our colleagues 
across the aisle have chosen not to do 
that and that this partisan spending 
spree has prevented real progress from 
being made in so many other areas. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO SARA HOTTMAN 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, few 
things are harder in this job than when 
you have to say goodbye to a member 
of your team. With all of the time we 
spend together, it is impossible not to 
grow close to the men and women who 
make up that team. The team members 
become our colleagues, our friends, our 
families. 
I am here on the floor today to recog-
nize and bid farewell to a valued and 
integral member of my Senate family 
who, after more than 5 years, is leaving 
to start the next chapter of her career. 
She is my State communications direc-
tor, Sara Hottman. 
During her time on Team Merkley, 
Sara has not only helped communicate 
my message to the people back home in 
Oregon about the work I am doing on 
their behalf here in DC, but she has 
used her well-connected ear to the 
ground to help keep me in the loop on 
issues evolving back home. 
I have come to depend on her to keep 
me on the right track. She never shies 
away from delivering hard truths when 
they are needed. She has used her vast 
experience in all different facets of the 
communications world—as a reporter, 
as the communications director for a 
municipality, as head of strategic com-
munications for the Oregon Zoo—to 
help deliver our message to the people 
of the State. It doesn’t hurt that in her 
spare 
time, 
Sara 
is 
a 
prolific 
kickboxer. So when she tells me some-
thing, I listen. She has been a real 
leader in our team, including participa-
tion in our Diversity, Equity and Inclu-
sion Steering Committee. 
She has done an amazing job time 
and time again putting together State 
events. We have traveled all across our 
sizable State for events that included 
press conferences to announce policies; 
press conferences to hear from stake-
holders in our State—for example, 
roundtables with nurses and medical 
professionals who are on the frontlines 
fighting the pandemic. Our events in-
cluded townhalls—a gathering with 
community leaders in every county 
every year, followed by a public town-
hall with people who will ask any ques-
tion they want. Our events included 
tours of State disasters. She expertly 
organized every event, ensuring media 
exposure and successfully striving to 
bring together a wide variety of expert 
and local voices to ensure that I was 
always learning more insights and per-
spectives on the issues that face us. 
At the end of the day, as we prepared 
to overnight somewhere around the 
State in preparation for another long 
day, she always knew the perfect local 
watering hole for the team to post up 
at to reminisce on how things had gone 
and to recover in preparation for the 
day that followed. 
When something went off the rails 
unexpectedly, she found a way to turn

it into an opportunity. When I was sur-
veying damage to a town incinerated 
by the 2020 Labor Day fires, I became 
so immersed in examining the fire 
damage that the rest of the delegation 
went on to the next event, and sud-
denly I realized we were left behind. 
She didn’t miss a beat. She used that 
time to gather more local community 
members who had been so impacted by 
the devastation of losing their homes. 
She managed to find a reporter who 
had also been left behind and arranged 
an impromptu one-on-one exclusive. So 
I utilized that opportunity to learn 
more and to communicate more when 
it could have just been a misstep. Well, 
that is what she does—turns missteps 
into opportunities. 
Cool and calm under pressure, she 
has a way of making everyone feel im-
portant and seen. She connects with 
folks everywhere she goes. 
I was thinking back to one townhall 
we did in early 2020 before the pan-
demic hit and shut things down. It was 
a small gathering in a classroom of a 
local school, but in that group was a 
young girl who was simply entranced 
by Sara. Throughout the townhall, she 
was following her around, imitating 
when Sara would take photos and ask-
ing questions of Sara even though the 
townhall was underway. Sara, being 
the person she is, kept answering those 
questions, kept letting the girl shadow 
her, still managing to get all of her 
work done while also inspiring this ad-
mirer. That is kind of just the charm-
ing ability to connect with folks and to 
stay calm in unexpected situations 
that have made traveling around the 
State long, busy travel days a real joy 
for the entire team. 
When the pandemic turned our world 
upside down in March of last year, she 
used her leadership and organizing 
skills to help me and the entire team 
transition to the new virtual world we 
were suddenly thrown into. She turned 
our townhalls and our weekly sessions 
of local Oregon reporters and television 
stations into virtual events so I could 
continue to provide information and 
connect with constituents during this 
extraordinary national crisis. She led 
the charge in updating our website to 
provide a one-stop shop of resources for 
residents and local businesses for infor-
mation on how to get the help they 
needed. 
To say that Sara will leave a large 
hole in our team when she heads off to 
her new responsibilities would be an 
understatement. Every member of our 
office, whether in Washington, DC, or 
back home in Oregon, is going to miss 
her bright smile, her sharp wit, her in-
fectious 
energy, 
and 
her 
brilliant 
mind—not to mention that we will also 
miss her border collie, Liz, who has 
been a therapy dog for all of us. 
Sara, if you are watching, and I hope 
you are, know that we all, the extended 
Team Merkley family, wish you well in 
the next phase of your career. Thank 
you for all you have done these past 5- 
plus years, and thank you for all you 
will continue to do to help build a bet-
ter world for the people of Oregon and 
the people of our Nation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, 20 years 
ago this week, the People’s Republic of 
China became a member of the World 
Trade Organization. There was great 
rejoicing across Washington by lobby-
ists and politicians and bureaucrats 
and, for that matter, among corporate 
CEOs and Wall Street bankers and per-
haps most of all, the Communists in 
Beijing. But for Americans out in the 
heartland, in places like Arkansas, Chi-
na’s entrance into the WTO was noth-
ing to celebrate. That was the moment 
their leaders left them exposed to the 
predations of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
Millions of Americans lost good-pay-
ing blue-collar jobs to the China trade 
shock in the years that followed. 
Countless small towns, Main Streets, 
and working-class neighborhoods were 
gutted and boarded up. Michigan lost 
24 percent of its manufacturing jobs. 
Ohio lost 27 percent of its manufac-
turing jobs. My home State has lost 26 
percent of all of our manufacturing 
jobs since China joined the World 
Trade 
Organization. 
Families 
were 
shattered and communities crumbled. 
The opioid crisis killed thousands of 
those who were left behind. 
Twenty years ago was nothing less 
than 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
great 
hollowing of our Nation’s industrial 
base, economy, and working class. It is 
worth recalling what our leaders said 
and what they promised as they un-
leashed this disaster. 
During the yearslong lobbying cam-
paign for China, then-President Bill 
Clinton said it was ‘‘ironic . . . that so 
many Americans are concerned about 
the impact on the world of a strong 
China.’’ From an economic standpoint, 
he said, ‘‘this agreement is the equiva-
lent of a one-way street.’’ In other 
words, it was all upside for America if 
only all those knuckle-draggers who 
opposed the Chinese Communist Party 
entering the World Trade Organization 
would get out of the way. 
Now, that attitude was the conven-
tional wisdom in Washington for years, 
and it was in both parties, to be sure. 
Four years after China joined the WTO, 
Republican U.S. Trade Representative 
Bob Zoellick reflected that ‘‘our policy 
has succeeded remarkably well: the 
dragon emerged and joined the world.’’ 
Well, it turns out—not surprisingly— 
that this dragon has fangs and claws, 
and now it is sitting on top of a vast 
pile of looted wealth. It is clear that 
our leaders and their naivete´ have cre-
ated a monster by admitting China to 
the WTO. Let’s just review some of the 
numbers. 
Since 2001, China’s economy has 
grown by nearly 1,200 percent, trans-
forming a third-world backwater into 
the second largest economy, largest ex-
porter, and dominant industrial power 
in the world. The PRC today makes 
one out of every four automobiles in 
the 
world—more 
than 
the 
United 
States, Japan, and South Korea com-
bined. Combined. It makes one out of 
every three merchant ships. In the 
United States, we make basically none. 
In addition, China produces 40 percent 
of mobile phones, 70 percent of tele-
visions, and 96 percent of shipping con-
tainers on which global commerce 
moves. 
Equally worrisome, China has gained 
a stranglehold over the production of 
essential materials. China produces 
more than half of the world’s steel, 
two-thirds of its active ingredients in 
our generic drugs, and processes 85 per-
cent of rare earth elements, 85 percent 
which are used in everything from the 
smartphone in your pocket to advanced 
fighter jets. 
China is also making strides in ad-
vanced technology. A few years ago, 
China’s space agency sent the world’s 
first quantum communications sat-
ellite into orbit. It already possesses 
200 of the world’s 500 fastest supercom-
puters. And Chairman Xi Jinping has 
pledged an astounding $1.4 trillion over 
6 years to help China take the lead in 
cutting-edge fields like semiconductors 
and artificial intelligence. 
The stark fact is that China controls 
nearly a quarter of global trade. A 
stunning 70 percent—70 percent, 7 out 
of 10 countries—in the world trade 
more with China than with the United 
States. 
Now, it would be one thing if China 
had gotten rich and powerful the hon-
est way, through fair competition and 
trade with other countries. 
Instead, 
China 
has 
gotten 
rich 
through a criminal spree of intellec-
tual property theft, industrial espio-
nage, strong-arm trade agreements, 
and illegal subsidies and protection or 
as the office of U.S. Trade Representa-
tive wrote: 
China has continued to embrace a state- 
led, non-market and mercantilist approach 
to the economy and trade, despite WTO 
members’ expectations—and China’s own 
representations—that China would trans-
form its economy and pursue the open, mar-
ket-oriented policies endorsed by the WTO. 
‘‘Despite WTO’s members’ expecta-
tions.’’ WTO members are stupid if 
they expected China to change its 
ways. 
But in other words, China lied, and 
the rest of the world has paid the price. 
China is the world’s most prolific IP 
thief, stealing the equivalent of Arkan-
sas’ economy two times over every 
year, year after year. And that is just 
the beginning. 
The Chinese Government recruits its 
citizens working and studying in our

country to act as spies, infiltrating our 
research laboratories and companies 
and college campuses to steal valuable 
secrets. Chinese nationals are the sub-
ject of nearly half—half—of all FBI 
counterintelligence 
cases 
involving 
economic espionage. 
The Chinese Communist Party also 
uses illegal subsidies and trade prac-
tices like dumping to help its ‘‘na-
tional champions’’ offload their stolen 
goods below-market prices. The Chi-
nese Government has poured tens of 
billions of dollars into its steel indus-
try, encouraging overcapacity to flood 
foreign markets with cheap Chinese 
steel. As a result, China’s production of 
crude steel rose from 15 percent of the 
world’s total to 50 percent between 2000 
and 2017, while 64 percent of America’s 
raw steel producers were totally wiped 
out, two-thirds of it gone. 
Of course, the World Trade Organiza-
tion exists—supposedly, allegedly—to 
curb these kinds of abuses, but it has 
utterly failed to get China to change 
its ways and live up to its promises. If 
anything, under Chairman Xi, China 
has dropped even the pretense that it is 
on the path to freeing its economy and 
society. 
Twenty years after China entered the 
WTO, it is clear that China has be-
trayed our trust and is waging an eco-
nomic war against us. We didn’t seek 
out this conflict, but now that it has 
started, we have no choice but to finish 
it. 
Congress can start by passing my 
bill, the China Trade Relations Act, to 
terminate China’s permanent normal 
trade relations status. We ought to ac-
knowledge there is nothing normal 
about our trading relationship with 
China, and we cannot afford the state 
of affairs to be permanent. We should 
return to the pre-WTO status quo that 
recognized China as a nonmarket, com-
munist country, to which I would add 
now, committing genocide against its 
own people. If we do this, we can begin 
to correct the historic mistake our 
leaders made 20 years ago when they 
welcomed China into the WTO with 
open arms and open wallets and un-
leashed that dragon on the world. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 
S.J. RES. 29 
Mr. MARKEY. I rise today in opposi-
tion to the latest effort by Republicans 
to undermine Americans’ health and 
safety. COVID–19 remains a grave dan-
ger. We have lost more than 775,000 
Americans to this virus, and cases are 
rising yet again. 
Despite this clear and present dan-
ger, millions of workers across this 
country have been showing up to their 
jobs every day since this pandemic 
began. Essential workers, nurses, doc-
tors, janitors, security guards, retail 
employees, and countless more were 
never able to work remotely. They 
can’t Zoom to the cash register, check-
out, or the driver’s seat of a bus. But 
these workers faced and continue to 
face on-the-job exposures and the haz-
ards those exposures entail. 
We are lucky to have tools to miti-
gate these dangers for workers. Testing 
works. Vaccines work. Booster shots 
work. Masks work. And as these new 
variants begin circulating around the 
globe and as vaccine effectiveness be-
gins to wane, for those who were 
among the first vaccinated, especially 
for older Americans and the immune 
compromised, it is incredibly impor-
tant that everyone get their boosters 
now. 
Let me just say that again: If you are 
eligible, don’t wait. Get your booster 
shot now. If you have two shots already 
and you got them 6 months ago, you 
are not fully vaccinated. If you don’t 
have your third shot right now, you are 
not fully vaccinated. If you have two 
shots already, and it is more than 6 
months after you got those first two 
shots, just understand that, when you 
say ‘‘I am vaccinated,’’ it is not accu-
rate. You need the third shot. 
Not only do the vaccines work, but 
vaccine requirements work. They in-
crease vaccination rates and improve 
worker safety. We have seen in Massa-
chusetts that, as the State government 
implemented 
vaccine 
requirements, 
vaccination rates approached 95 per-
cent of State employees. 
We aren’t just the Bay State; we are 
also the ‘‘Brain State.’’ We listened to 
what scientists and medical experts are 
telling us. 
So to protect workers, the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administra-
tion, or OSHA, at the Department of 
Labor, published a rule known as an 
emergency 
temporary 
standard—an 
emergency 
temporary 
standard, 
or 
ETS. 
That 
emergency 
temporary 
standard will keep employees safe by 
requiring large companies to ensure 
that each of their workers is fully vac-
cinated. 
And if employees cannot or will not 
be vaccinated, they simply must test 
negative for COVID–19 at least once a 
week before coming into work. It is as 
simple as that: Get vaccinated or get 
tested. 
The ETS also requires that employ-
ees protect their coworkers by wearing 
a mask in the workplace. This require-
ment is not onerous. In fact, it is flexi-
ble for all workers to require employ-
ees to provide paid time off to workers 
to get vaccinated and ensures that paid 
leave is provided for recovery from any 
side effects of the vaccinations that 
keep employees from being able to 
work. 
These are simple, commonsense rules 
that will save lives—testing, masks, 
vaccines, boosters. OSHA estimates 
that its emergency temporary standard 
will prevent 6,500 people from dying 
and 250,000 people from having to go to 
become hospitalized over just a 6- 
month period. 
But while Democrats and the Biden 
Administration are doing everything 
possible to maintain an economic and 
health recovery, Republicans are doing 
everything 
they 
can 
to 
undercut 
science and confidence in this adminis-
tration. This latest attempt—trying to 
overturn the OSHA emergency tem-
porary standard and threatening to un-
dermine the health and safety of mil-
lions of workers—is outrageous and the 
worst kind of political stunt. 
We mandate vaccinations for our 
children so that they can be healthy 
and go to school. We mandate vaccina-
tions so our servicemembers are pro-
tected in the line of duty. Let us pro-
tect our workers in our workplaces so 
that they can stay healthy and stay on 
the job. 
But there is a terrible irony here 
from my Republican colleagues. At the 
exact same time that the Grand Old 
Party is bemoaning this OSHA worker 
protection effort as a so-called man-
date, they are celebrating mandating 
government control over women’s re-
productive freedom at the Supreme 
Court. They would rather mandate gov-
ernment control over a woman’s body 
than mandate worker safety. 
If we want to end this pandemic, we 
need to get as many people vaccinated 
as we can. Unfortunately, Republicans 
see a political benefit to prolonging the 
pain and the suffering from the virus 
and preventing vaccinations where pos-
sible. 
This is wrong. This is immoral. And I 
urge my colleagues to support the 
OSHA emergency temporary standard. 
I urge my colleagues to support that 
emergency temporary standard and op-
pose this effort by Republicans to over-
turn this critical, life-protecting regu-
lation, which is on the books, if we can 
keep it there. 
So we need to ensure that we are say-
ing to every family: We have your 
back. We are going to be protecting 
you. We are going to make sure those 
safeguards are in place. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF RACHAEL S. ROLLINS 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to strongly oppose the confirmation of 
Rachael Rollins to be U.S. attorney in 
Massachusetts. 
Many Americans have probably never 
heard of Rachael Rollins, but they are 
becoming very familiar with the kind 
of lawlessness and dangerous crime 
that radical, leftwing district attor-
neys like her have generated. Under

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9012 
December 8, 2021 
their watch, we have seen looting and 
larceny and violent crime rates rise in 
cities all over the country the past 
couple of years. 
Ms. Rollins is part of a web of left-
wing district attorneys across the 
country who see it as their job not to 
prosecute crime; rather, to protect 
criminals. There is Ms. Rollins in Bos-
ton, Chesa Boudin in San Francisco, 
Kim Gardner in St. Louis, Kim Foxx in 
Chicago, Larry Krasner in Philadel-
phia, and John Chisholm in Milwaukee, 
among others. 
What has happened with these pros-
ecutors who refuse to prosecute crime? 
Well, all too predictably, crime rates 
have skyrocketed. 
Last year, the murder rate went up 
nearly 30 percent overall, and it went 
up 40 percent in cities with populations 
between 100,000 and 250,000. 
We have seen horrific crimes and 
tragedies that could have been pre-
vented if these DAs had simply done 
their jobs. 
Take John Chisholm, the DA in Mil-
waukee, who released Darrell Brooks, a 
repeat and dangerous criminal, on 
$1,000 bail. 
What was the crime he was charged 
with? 
Using his vehicle—a red SUV—to run 
down a woman, the mother of his child. 
Released on $1,000 bail, what hap-
pened? 
Brooks, as we all know, drove that 
same red SUV through a Christmas pa-
rade, murdered six people, including an 
8-year-old boy. 
That man should not have been on 
the streets, should not have been be-
hind the wheel. The DA knew he was a 
violent criminal who used that SUV as 
an instrument of violence and, for 
$1,000, the leftwing DA let him go. Had 
Brooks not been out on such a low bail, 
this horrific tragedy wouldn’t have oc-
curred; that 8-year-old boy would still 
be alive. 
Our communities don’t need prosecu-
tors who endanger the very commu-
nities they are supposed to serve by re-
fusing to prosecute or detain criminals. 
They don’t need leftwing prosecutors 
who let violent criminals walk the 
streets. 
The damage that these so-called 
prosecutors can do has, thankfully, 
been somewhat limited by the fact 
that, when they choose not to pros-
ecute criminals, the Federal Govern-
ment has the ability, in many in-
stances, to step in and charge crimi-
nals federally. 
But Joe Biden and Senate Democrats 
are working to change that by ele-
vating one of these radical, leftist, 
soft-on-crime 
district 
attorneys, 
Rachael Rollins, to be the U.S. attor-
ney in Massachusetts—the chief Fed-
eral prosecutor in the entire State of 
Massachusetts. 
Let’s talk a bit more about what ex-
actly Rachael Rollins believes prosecu-
tors should do and what her record is. 
Rachael Rollins has been vocal and 
aggressive against prosecuting crime. 
She has been very clear that she came 
into the job of district attorney as a 
crusader. 
She has said—and these are her 
words: 
If you want to change the criminal legal 
system, become a prosecutor [because they 
have the] power to determine charges, what 
crimes to decline to prosecute or divert, 
[and] how to fashion bail hearings. 
She has been quite open in what her 
intentions are. Ms. Rollins tells us that 
what matters about a prosecutor is not 
taking bad guys off the street; it is not 
seeking justice for the victims of 
crime. No. It is the power to say: ‘‘I 
won’t prosecute these crimes.’’ 
(Ms. ROSEN assumed the chair.) 
And with Ms. Rollins, it is not hypo-
thetical because she is a district attor-
ney. And as the Boston DA, she went so 
far as to write down in ‘‘The Rachael 
Rollins Policy Memo,’’ a list of 15 
crimes whose prosecution should ‘‘al-
ways be declined’’ or ‘‘dismissed with-
out conditions.’’ 
Charges on this list of 15 crimes 
should 
be 
declined 
or 
dismissed 
prearraignment 
without 
conditions. 
The presumption is that charges that 
fall into this category should always be 
declined. 
So you have a DA saying these are 
the crimes we don’t prosecute, ‘‘always 
be declined,’’ ‘‘dismissed without con-
ditions.’’ 
So you may say: ‘‘OK. Maybe this is 
like some sort of criminal justice re-
form. Maybe this is low-level, non-
violent marijuana possession. A teen-
ager got caught with a joint; we are 
not going to prosecute them.’’ Reason-
able people can actually disagree on 
that. We can have an intelligent con-
versation back and forth about that. 
But the beauty of it is that we don’t 
have to speculate because she put it in 
writing. These are the 15 crimes. They 
are upside down, as are her policies. 
These are the 15 crimes where charges 
should be dismissed prearraignment 
without conditions: 
No. 1, trespass. Now, I want you to 
think about it. If you don’t want to see 
people trespassing on your property, 
well, under Rachael Rollins, the Demo-
crats’ U.S. attorney, we don’t pros-
ecute trespass. 
What else? 
Shoplifting. Has anyone watched the 
videos of the people breaking into 
stores and stealing and stealing and 
stealing and looting? Do you know 
what? Joe Biden and Senate Demo-
crats—they are bringing that to a 
neighborhood near you. 
Shoplifting, we don’t prosecute. That 
is what she said. Shoplifting, olly oxen 
free. If you see a TV you like, pick that 
damn thing up and run out of the store 
because your friend, the fake pros-
ecutor, is not going to charge you. 
Larceny. Really, larceny? Larceny, 
we don’t prosecute. 
Disorderly conduct. You are a single 
mom coming home at night. A drunk 
vagrant is yelling, screaming, cursing 
at your kids. Do you know what? Not a 
crime here. We don’t prosecute that. 
What else? 
Receiving stolen property. OK. This 
is at least intellectually consistent. If 
you are going to legalize shoplifting, 
rob the hell out of the stores, at least 
the fence can be on the back end. You 
can steal that TV and go straight to 
the fence. By the way, I guess you can 
do it in a parking lot. Set up a van 
right there. ‘‘We fence stolen prop-
erty.’’ You run in and grab it, I will 
fence it right here. DA? ‘‘All good by 
us.’’ 
Driving with a suspended license. 
Well, sometimes that might be OK. 
What was it suspended for? Was it 
suspended for DWI? Was it suspended 
because you are a drunk who has killed 
people? Were you suspended because 
you are this homicidal maniac in Mil-
waukee who murdered six people? 
Do you know what? This DA says: 
‘‘Hey, driving with a suspended license, 
no problem at all, no longer a crime.’’ 
Breaking and entering into a vacant 
property without property damage. So 
any property that is vacant, you can 
break in, and you are fine. Locks don’t 
matter. Burglar alarms don’t matter. 
By the way, if a burglar alarm goes off, 
what the hell do you do? You show up, 
‘‘Hey, you don’t prosecute it. I’m stay-
ing right here.’’ 
You may say: ‘‘Well, at least it is 
something reasonable, without prop-
erty damage, right?’’ Well, now, except 
the problem is No. 8 on the list: break-
ing and entering into a vacant property 
with property damage. 
So it doesn’t matter. Break into the 
place, loot it, trash it, destroy it. All is 
good in Joe Biden’s criminal-friendly 
America. 
No. 9, wanton or malicious destruc-
tion of property. By the way, don’t be-
lieve the Democratic talking point: 
‘‘This stuff isn’t violent.’’ Really, wan-
ton or malicious destruction of prop-
erty? Not a crime in Joe Biden’s Amer-
ica. 
Threats, threats of violence. I want 
you to imagine right now you have got 
an angry vagrant making threats of vi-
olence against your children. You call 
the DA and say: ‘‘My family is being 
threatened. Protect our safety.’’ And 
what does she say? ‘‘Not a crime.’’ 
Oh, well, stinks to be you. Threats 
are just A-OK. 
Minor in possession of alcohol. Hey, 
great. Kids, drink up. Actually, the 
beauty of it is, in Joe Biden’s America, 
the kids can get drunk; they can drive; 
they can have their license suspended; 
and apparently they will get a gold 
star at the end of it. Minors in posses-
sion of alcohol. We have got Senate 
pages here. Just go down to the U.S. 
attorney’s office. They are serving 
margaritas. 
Marijuana possession. OK. As I said, 
we can debate marijuana possession. 
Reasonable people can disagree on 
that. Now, it doesn’t specify the quan-
tity. A teenager with a joint? You can 
say that that may be a good candidate 
for diversion to something else. Drug 
dealer with several kilos of pot in the

back, maybe you ought to be pros-
ecuting that. 
Oh, and, by the way, how do we know 
she doesn’t just limit it to kids with a 
joint? Well, what is No. 13 on the list? 
Possession with intent to distribute. 
So, drug dealers—in Joe Biden’s 
America, drug dealers, it is legal. You 
can sell booze to kids. You can sell 
drugs to kids. You can sell stolen tele-
visions to kids. She doesn’t prosecute 
drug dealers. 
But look, at least it is just pot and 
come on, we know—you know, in 
States—in a lot of States pot is not 
that bad, right? It is just pot. 
Uh-oh. No. 14, nonmarijuana drug 
possession. So for any Democrats ready 
to go home, saying, ‘‘Hey, we just like 
pot because we are Democrats,’’ nope. 
Heroin, cocaine, LSD, fentanyl drug 
dealers who are poisoning our kids, in 
Joe Biden’s America, we don’t pros-
ecute you. 
And No. 15 is really the crowning 
jewel of this—resisting arrest. So I 
want you to envision what this says. 
You can break and enter into a vacant 
property and do damage. You can have 
a homeless person trespass on your 
front lawn, set up a tent, threaten your 
children, sell them drugs, and if a po-
lice officer shows up and tries to arrest 
them, they can violently resist arrest. 
And what does the DA say? ‘‘All good 
by me. Not a crime.’’ 
Madam President, this is, in a word, 
nuts. This is crazy. 
And do you know what? This is what 
the Democrats support. 
I will tell you why. The Democrats 
are counting on the news media refus-
ing to cover this. The Democrats are 
counting on ABC, NBC, and CBS—this 
is not news. The Democrats are count-
ing on CNN will not cover this. 
Every single Democrat in this body 
has voted for Rachael Rollins. They 
had to bring Vice President HARRIS out 
to break the tie. 
And, you know, Democrats, when 
they go home, they like to say: ‘‘We 
are not for abolishing the police.’’ 
No. Do you know what? When you 
vote to confirm a lawless so-called 
prosecutor who says ‘‘I won’t prosecute 
crime,’’ you have abolished the police. 
Cops can arrest them, but the DA will 
let them go. And what does she say? 
‘‘Dismissed . . . prearraignment . . . 
without conditions.’’ 
This is radical and extreme, and I 
want to make a challenge to Senate 
Democrat colleagues. Some of you are 
in purple States. A few of you are in 
red States. Some of you are in bright 
blue States. I challenge any of you in 
the bluest State of the Union to go 
home to your constituents, get any 
gathering in a townhall, and put this 
chart in front of them. Ask your con-
stituents: Do the people of Nevada 
agree that we shouldn’t prosecute tres-
passing or shoplifting or drug dealing 
or resisting arrest or violent threats? 
Do the people of Virginia agree that 
these are not crimes and shouldn’t be 
prosecuted? 
And I promise you, in all 50 States, 
there is not a State too blue where 
your constituents would agree on this. 
And so what our Democratic colleagues 
are counting on is that people won’t 
know. 
You know, before the vote, I spoke 
with several Democrats. I tried to tell 
several Democrats, this is a bad vote. 
This is a vote you are going to regret. 
This is a vote your constituents are 
going to be mad at you for. One of 
those Democrats said: ‘‘Well, the ma-
jority leader asked me to do it.’’ 
You know, crack the whip, party 
unity, party discipline. The order from 
the Democrats in the White House is 
this is the chief Federal law enforce-
ment officer in the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts. God help you if you 
don’t want violent criminals robbing 
your store. God help you if you don’t 
want drunken homeless people setting 
up tents in your front yard. God help 
you if you don’t want drug dealers sell-
ing drugs to your children because Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS have said 
those are all A–OK. And if you don’t be-
lieve me—because in this bizarre par-
tisan world nobody believes the other 
side—read the memo, ‘‘The Rachael 
Rollins Policy Memo.’’ She wrote it. 
She put her name on it in writing. This 
is what it says. 
If we lived in a time of sanity—Sen-
ators on both sides—Democrats listen-
ing to this would say: ‘‘Hold on a sec-
ond. That doesn’t make any sense at 
all. Let’s tap the brakes.’’ 
By the way, one Democrat could stop 
this nomination—one. Every individual 
Democrat, you had the choice. It 
means every one of you is also the de-
ciding vote. So when you go back to 
your home State, you singlehandedly 
decided this lawless, so-called pros-
ecutor should be confirmed. 
I will tell you this, you can never 
again claim you oppose abolishing the 
police because this vote is front and 
center: trespassing, not prosecuted; 
shoplifting; larceny; disorderly con-
duct; receiving stolen property; driving 
with a suspended license; breaking and 
entering with property damage; loss 
and malicious destruction of property; 
threats; minors in possession of alco-
hol; marijuana possession; possession 
with intent to distribute; nonmari-
juana drug possession. 
I don’t ever want to see a Democrat 
standing 
up 
here 
talking 
about 
fentanyl: Fentanyl is terrible. I don’t 
want to see another Democrat talking 
about the opioid crisis, saying: ‘‘People 
are dying in New Hampshire. People 
are dying in my State.’’ They are, and 
you are about to vote for a prosecutor 
who won’t prosecute the drug dealers 
selling those opioids and poisoning our 
children and won’t prosecute resisting 
arrest. So, if a cop comes, take a swing. 
To my colleagues on the Democratic 
side of the aisle, there is still time for 
you to stop this nomination. I implore 
of you: Listen to your constituents and 
do the right thing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the vote not 
begin until following my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, in a 
minute, I am going to ask unanimous 
consent for the approval of three im-
portant nominees who are not con-
troversial. We have been hearing rea-
sons to oppose a nominee who has some 
controversy, and I am going to raise 
three who are not controversial. 
In July, I had the opportunity to 
travel to Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, 
and Guatemala as part of a bipartisan 
congressional 
delegation. 
The 
first 
question we received in Mexico was not 
about COVID–19 and not about immi-
gration. It was, When is your Ambas-
sador going to get here? 
Fortunately, since then, the Senate 
has approved the nomination of Ken 
Salazar to be Ambassador to Mexico, 
but the exchange underscores the im-
portance of having U.S. Ambassadors 
on the ground and the value that other 
nations see in Senate-confirmed rep-
resentatives of the United States. 
I take the floor today to talk about 
three 
noncontroversial 
nominees: 
Adam Scheinman, of Virginia, to be 
Special Representative of the Presi-
dent 
for 
Nuclear 
Nonproliferation; 
Marc Ostfield to be Ambassador to 
Paraguay; and Cynthia Telles to be 
Ambassador to Costa Rica. 
Mr. Scheinman has had a long his-
tory in the State Department and on 
the National Security Council at the 
White House on Nuclear Nonprolifera-
tion issues. 
Marc Ostfield is a career Foreign 
Service Officer with deep experience in 
the Americas. 
Cynthia Telles is the daughter of the 
first Hispanic to be a U.S. Ambassador. 
Her father was the U.S. Ambassador to 
Costa Rica 60 years ago, and after a 
very distinguished career, she has been 
nominated to inherit the post that he 
ably inhabited. 
These were all nominees approved 
noncontroversially by the Foreign Re-
lations Committee on October 19, near-
ly 2 months ago. 
I will just mention to my colleagues 
one thing about Mr. Scheinman. It is 
particularly important that he be con-
firmed as soon as possible. An impor-
tant duty of the Special Representative 
of the President for Nuclear Non-
proliferation is to lead the U.S. delega-
tion to the Non-Proliferation of Nu-
clear Weapons Treaty Review Con-
ference. This conference happens once 
every 5 years—once every 5 years—and 
it is going to happen next month. If he 
is not confirmed before then, the 
United States will not have an Ambas-
sador-level official to lead the Amer-
ican delegation at this existentially 
important meeting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9014 
December 8, 2021 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate consider the 
following nominations: Executive Cal-
endar Nos. 433, 436, and 439; that the 
nominations be confirmed; that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate; that no 
further motions be in order on these 
nominations; that any related state-
ments be printed in the RECORD; and 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The eyes of history are on the Senate 
today. If the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline 
comes online, as it is on the verge of 
doing, the odds of Russian tanks roll-
ing into Ukraine increase dramati-
cally. We have imposed sanctions on 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline with bipar-
tisan unity. We can do it again. 
If Russian tanks roll into Kiev, who 
in this Chamber wants that on their 
conscience? 
We need to stop Russia from invading 
Ukraine, and the only way to do it is 
by imposing sanctions on Nord Stream 
2. We did that 2 years ago. We over-
whelmingly passed bipartisan sanc-
tions that President Trump signed into 
law. 
It is worth explaining why these two 
are linked. 
We are all reading in the newspaper— 
and my friend from Virginia and I have 
sat in briefings, classified and public 
briefings—that over 100,000 Russian 
troops are massed on the Ukraine bor-
der. The administration declassified its 
own projections that an invasion of 
Ukraine is imminent and could come as 
soon as January or February of next 
year. This disaster is the direct result 
of a political mistake made by Joe 
Biden. 
What does the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line have to do with Russia’s invading 
Ukraine? 
Well, here is a little bit of ancient 
history. In the year 2014, Vladimir 
Putin invaded Ukraine. 
Why? 
He did it because he has said that he 
considers the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union to be the greatest geopolitical 
disaster of the 21st century, and his 
grand ambition is to recreate the So-
viet Union—by force. 
A reassembled Soviet Union would be 
a profound threat to the safety of all 
Americans. We spent decades with a 
dangerous Soviet Union. In 2014, Putin 
invaded Ukraine—he invaded Crimea— 
but he stopped. He didn’t go through 
all of Ukraine. 
Why did he stop? 
He stopped because Russian natural 
gas, to get to Europe, goes through 
Ukraine. The pipelines go through 
Ukraine. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, may I 
invoke regular order? This is not a re-
sponse to any of these three nomina-
tions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the request? 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
There is nothing in regular order 
that limits my ability to explain my 
view on this topic. 
So, apparently, the Democrats don’t 
want to talk about Joe Biden’s gift to 
Russia and Putin that has set up the 
tanks on the border of Ukraine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the original request? 
Mr. CRUZ. Is the Chair refusing to 
let me speak? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate has a scheduled vote. You see that 
Members have made their way to the 
floor. We have a lot of business to take 
care of, as you see. 
Mr. CRUZ. And, just a moment ago, 
the Chair granted unanimous consent 
that that time be extended until this 
unanimous consent request was con-
cluded. That is the pending UC that 
was granted. 
If Senator KAINE or the Chair wants 
to silence me because you don’t want 
to hear what is happening in Ukraine, 
you can try to do that. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, we 
have no interest in silencing Senator 
CRUZ. In fact, the Democrats agreed to 
allow Senator CRUZ
to present his 
amendment on Nord Stream 2 last 
week, and it was blocked by Repub-
lican colleagues. 
I have made a request for unanimous 
consent about two Ambassadors to the 
Americas and about someone who 
needs to attend a nuclear nonprolifera-
tion conference and lead the delegation 
from the United States. It happens 
once every 5 years, and it is coming up. 
The Senator is allowed to speak 
about Nord Stream 2 for as long as he 
wants, but he shouldn’t interrupt a UC 
for these three individuals to give a 
speech that he has given many times 
and that he is going to continue to give 
many times, and I am sure we are all 
going to hear it many times. 
I would like a ruling on my request 
for unanimous consent on these three 
nominees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the original request? 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ob-
ject. And the Chair and the Democrats 
are hiding from the truth. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I yield 
the floor. 
VOTE ON ROLLINS NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Rollins nomination? 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the vote on 
the confirmation of the Smith nomina-
tion scheduled for 5:15 p.m. instead 
occur at 6:45 p.m.; that upon disposi-
tion of the Smith nomination, the Sen-
ate resume legislative session and that 
all time in relation to S.J. Res. 29 be 
expired. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Therefore, for the in-
formation of Senators, there will be 
two rollcall votes beginning at 6:45 
p.m. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yester-
day, Chicago reported its first case of 
the new coronavirus variant, Omicron. 
Our State’s health officials predicted 
this day would come; it did. They are 
actively preparing for additional cases. 
The World Health Organization has 
identified it as a variant of concern. It 
has the potential for increased trans-
missibility and could possibly—I under-
line ‘‘possibly’’—evade some protec-
tions from existing vaccines. 
But as we begin to learn about this 
variant, 
some 
hopeful 
signs 
have 
emerged. On Sunday, Dr. Fauci de-
scribed early data on the severity of 
Omicron as ‘‘encouraging.’’ Addition-
ally, today, we received preliminary 
findings that patients are better pro-
tected against Omicron with a third 
Pfizer dose. 
And while it is still too soon to draw 
any definitive conclusions—too soon— 
what is clear is that the historic in-
vestments we have made—the Senate 
and 
President 
Biden—these 
invest-
ments in public health are paying off. 
Thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan—which we passed earlier this year 
on, sadly, a partisan rollcall without a 
single Republican vote—America is 
more prepared. That rescue package 
not only funded production and dis-
tribution of lifesaving vaccines; it 
paved the way for public health offi-
cials to detect and track new variants 
like Omicron. It provided more than a 
billion dollars toward expanding and 
accelerating genomic sequencing, the 
process that allows us to analyze how 
the coronavirus is evolving and spread-
ing in realtime, so we can respond. 
Thanks to this investment today, 
America is sequencing roughly 80,000 
virus samples a week. Before President 
Biden took office, we were sequencing 
fewer than 3,000; now, 80,000 a week. 
That has made a world of difference 
when it comes to tracking the spread 
of a variant. 
In less than 2 weeks since the variant 
was discovered in South Africa, it has 
been identified in at least 19 States in 
addition to Illinois. 
As we await more data on the risk 
Omicron poses to the public, here are 
three things we know. First—and it 
bears repeating—the best protection is 
to get vaccinated. Ninety-five percent 
of Americans are eligible, and 70 per-
cent have already gotten at least one 
shot. Within days, we will hit the im-
pressive milestone of 200 million Amer-
icans getting fully vaccinated. We need 
to continue to promote this incredible 
safety tool, and that means booster 
shots as well. 
Second, America must continue to 
support the global vaccine campaign. 
As I have said before, COVID doesn’t 
know borders. As long as it is circu-
lating across the globe, the risk of 
virus mutation growing stronger and 
roaring back into the United States 
continues to be real. 
Fortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has already taken important steps 
to address global vaccine inequality 
and get more shots to low-income 
countries. Just this week, USAID an-
nounced a $400 million investment in a 
new global vaccine access program to 
deliver vaccines to remote parts of the 
world. 
I just got off the phone with Dr. Atul 
Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital, a prolific author, 
and a man who is very insightful. He 
has agreed to step forward and to work 
with Administrator Samantha Power 
at USAID. He is the right person for 
this job at this very moment. So I en-
courage my colleagues to let him move 
off the calendar and into the job as 
quickly as possible. We need his exper-
tise at USAID. 
The third point I would like to make 
is that we need to build on the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan’s investment in pub-
lic health. Effective public health sys-
tems are like smoke detectors: They 
can alert us to deadly dangers long be-
fore they threaten. 
At the start of this pandemic, Amer-
ica’s public health system had been ig-
nored and underfunded for years. That 
is the reason why we proposed nearly 
$10 billion in the Build Back Better 
plan, which we are currently working 
on, to improve laboratory capacity, 
disease detection, the workforce, and 
public health preparedness. This fund-
ing will fortify our public health sys-
tem at a time when it is absolutely 
necessary. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. President, on a related matter, 
just before Thanksgiving, the House of 
Representatives passed the Build Back 
Better Act. It is one of the most pro- 
family pieces of legislation in modern 
history. 
For nearly 50 years, the wealthy in 
America have gotten richer while the 
middle class has been squeezed. Build 
Back Better is about restoring fairness. 
Four years ago, when the Repub-
licans had their chance to use the rec-
onciliation process, they really identi-
fied their highest priority: tax breaks 
for the wealthiest Americans. They 
continue to hold to the philosophy that 
if you give tax breaks to wealthy peo-
ple, eventually people who are in the 
middle-income 
categories—working 
families—will start to see some bene-
fits coming their way. I couldn’t dis-
agree more. 
I believe investing in working fami-
lies in America has always been the 
best investment. These are families 
with kids who are destined for college 
and even better jobs if we invest in 
those families and give them a fighting 
chance. The wealthy are going to do 
just fine by themselves, and they are 
doing pretty well, I might add. 
We have got to make sure that this 
Build Back Better Act, which Presi-
dent Biden supports, really focuses on 
working families. And that is why the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9016 
December 8, 2021 
bill that passed the House has the larg-
est tax cut for middle-class and work-
ing families ever in America’s history. 
That bears repeating. 
Four years ago, the Republicans gave 
a tax break to the wealthiest people in 
America. The bill that we are consid-
ering will give the largest tax cut for 
middle class and working families in 
our Nation’s history. It helps families 
with big-ticket items that keep people 
up at night: affordable childcare; uni-
versal pre-kindergarten; expanded, af-
fordable healthcare coverage; help with 
affordable housing. It makes serious in-
vestments in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Let’s be very clear about it. I can re-
member a time when the whole issue of 
climate change and global warming 
was a truly bipartisan concern. The 
bills that used to come to the floor 
were cosponsored by the likes of John 
McCain and Joe Lieberman, a Repub-
lican and a Democrat, both very seri-
ously concerned about what was hap-
pening to the world’s environment. 
That is no longer the case. It is a 
struggle for us to get Republicans to 
even acknowledge that there is a chal-
lenge, let alone accept the challenge of 
the solutions that lie ahead. 
We need to make serious investments 
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and the effects of climate change. And 
critically important to our future eco-
nomic prosperity, we need Build Back 
Better to make investments in higher 
education and affordability, which is 
the next topic I would like to address. 
PELL GRANT PROGRAM 
Mr. President, the Pell Grant Pro-
gram has been the cornerstone of 
America’s investment in college stu-
dent aid for more than 50 years, but it 
has failed to keep up with the times. It 
was created in 1972—think about that— 
almost 50 years ago, and at the time 
the Pell grants were worth more than 
75 percent of the average cost of at-
tending a 4-year public college or uni-
versity—tuition, fees, and living ex-
penses. The Pell grant covered 75 per-
cent of it. Today, the Pell grant covers 
less than 30 percent. 
Well, what makes up the difference? 
Student debt makes up the difference. 
Forty-five million Americans now own 
$1.7 trillion—that is with a ‘‘t’’—$1.7 
trillion in student loan debt. That is 
more than America’s combined debt to 
credit card companies. It is second only 
to mortgages. It is the largest con-
sumer debt in America. Build Back 
Better will ease the squeeze of college 
costs by increasing the maximum Pell 
grant by $550. It will also expand Pell 
grants and other forms of Federal aid 
to DACA students. These historic in-
vestments will help 5 million students 
from lower incomes earn college de-
grees and build a better, stronger 
America. 
Now, there is one item in here that I 
am going to close with that is very im-
portant. For years, I brought to the at-
tention of the Senate one industry that 
purports to be part of education in 
America—for-profit colleges and uni-
versities. With this new Pell grant, we 
make it clear that the $550 increase 
will not go to for-profit colleges. 
Why, you ask? Take a look at the 
record. The for-profit college industry 
is one of the most heavily federally 
subsidized sectors in America. Some 
for-profit college companies receive 100 
percent of their revenue from Federal 
taxpayers. That is right. Pell grants 
and student loans make up their entire 
revenue. 
The University of Phoenix is one of 
the giants in the industry—has been 
for years. One of the founders once 
called Pell grants and student loans 
‘‘the juice’’ for the for-profit college in-
dustry. It was one of the largest ever 
increases to the Pell grant on the 
table. The for-profit college industry is 
looking for more ‘‘juice.’’ They are not 
going to get it, and I am glad they 
don’t. 
I would like to leave those who are 
following my remarks with a quiz. 
What percentage of post-secondary stu-
dents in America attend for-profit col-
leges and universities? The answer: 8 
percent. 
Next question: What percentage of 
defaults on student loans are by stu-
dents from for-profit colleges and uni-
versities? The answer: 30 percent—8 
percent of the students and 30 percent 
of the student loan defaults. 
Is it just bad luck? No. It is by de-
sign. For-profit colleges and univer-
sities will literally accept anyone with 
a pulse. You do not have to show any 
aptitude or any ambition. If you will 
sign on the dotted line and they can 
take over your Pell grant and hook you 
up with a student loan, they are per-
fectly happy. 
Then what happens? Well, the net re-
sult of it is often disappointing. The 
students have to drop out. They can’t 
continue to pay the high tuitions at 
these places, and when they drop out, 
they still have a mountain of debt to 
pay off. Eventually, you will get a de-
fault on it—30 percent of them are 
going to default on it. That is an out-
rageous number when you think about 
it. Also, I might add, these so-called 
colleges and universities are notorious 
for 
fraudulent 
conduct—misleading 
their students about what they are 
learning and what they can earn from 
what they learn. It is a terrible record. 
For-profit colleges just spend 26 per-
cent of their revenue on instruction. 
Well, what do they do with 74 percent? 
They market, and they take it as prof-
it. Twenty-six percent of their revenue 
on education—it is a joke. And we are 
fools to keep perpetuating this terrible 
drain on the American economy and 
this terrible hardship on some of these 
students and their families. 
So over the last 20 years, nearly 
every major for-profit college has been 
investigated and sued by State and 
Federal agencies for deception and abu-
sive practices. 
Many, like the University of Phoe-
nix, and DeVry, which sadly is from 
the city of Chicago, got paid tens of 
millions of dollars in Federal subsidies. 
Since the collapse of the most infa-
mous 
for-profit 
colleges—Corinthian 
and ITT Tech—we see taxpayers hold-
ing the bag for the defaulted student 
loans to the tune of millions of dollars. 
So let’s be clear. Adding new pro-
gram protections in Build Back Better 
is not about Congress punishing stu-
dents. The for-profit college industry is 
doing that quite well by themselves. 
This is about protecting traditionally 
underserved and marginalized students 
and preventing taxpayer dollars from 
being wasted on these miserable insti-
tutions. 
In closing, I ask unanimous consent 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD a letter from a coalition of 
groups urging Congress to support 
these new protections for Pell grants— 
among 
them, 
the 
National 
Urban 
League, the Education Trust, and Vet-
erans Education Success. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NOVEMBER 17, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER SCHU-
MER: We represent a broad coalition of orga-
nizations working on behalf of students, vet-
erans, faculty and staff, civil rights advo-
cates, researchers, and others concerned 
about career education programs that leave 
students with debts they cannot afford. 
Predatory schools leave students with unfair 
and unaffordable student loan debt and leave 
taxpayers exposed when students cannot 
repay those debts. 
We strongly support the Build Back Better 
bill’s investments in higher education, in-
cluding the $550 increase to the maximum 
Pell grant. Pell grants have helped millions 
of low- and moderate-income Americans, 
most with family incomes under $40,000, at-
tend and complete college. We also support 
incentivizing students to attend schools 
where Pell grant dollars will go the furthest, 
and where increases in aid are less likely to 
translate into increased tuition costs and 
debt. Excluding schools that operate on a 
for-profit basis will promote both goals. 
Research shows that—in contrast to other 
sectors of higher education—tuition rises at 
for-profit colleges when additional federal fi-
nancial aid is made available to the sector. 
Further, investigations and data spanning 
more than a decade show that for-profit col-
leges, overall, provide worse outcomes for 
students than other sectors of higher edu-
cation. High prices, low spending on instruc-
tion, and high dropout rates at many for- 
profit schools have left former students, in-
cluding a disproportionate share of Black 
and Latina/o borrowers, buried in debt and 
without 
the 
career 
advancement 
they 
sought. 
For-profit colleges spend just 26 percent of 
the tuition revenue they receive on instruc-
tion, compared to 79 percent at nonprofit 
colleges and an even higher percent at four- 
year public colleges. Just 25 percent of for- 
profit students graduate with a bachelor’s 
degree in six years, compared to 61–67 per-
cent in other four-year sectors. For-profit in-
stitutions account for less than 10 percent of 
overall college enrollment but make up one- 
third of all students in default.

Additionally, many for-profit schools have 
engaged in predatory and deceptive practices 
to recruit students into low-quality pro-
grams. 
When 
investigations 
have 
docu-
mented such deception and fraud, the schools 
have collapsed and closed, taking taxpayer 
dollars with them and leaving students with 
neither credentials nor enhanced earning 
power. Since 2009–10, more than $9 billion in 
Pell grants have gone to for-profit schools 
that have collapsed. ITT Tech and Corin-
thian Colleges alone received more than $4.2 
billion in Pell grants in the six years before 
both schools shuttered. 
Multiple states, including California and 
Washington, have taken steps to allocate 
state financial aid dollars in a manner com-
parable to the Build Back Better provision— 
directing students to more valuable pro-
grams by increasing available aid for those 
programs. The approach taken in the Build 
Back Better Act will focus new Pell grant in-
vestments in a simple and effective way that 
will reduce waste, fraud, and abuse. 
The Build Back Better bill makes an ap-
propriate decision to direct the Pell grant in-
crease in a manner that maximizes federal 
resources. We thank you for the hard work 
on the Build Back Better package, and we 
look forward to working together to pass 
this provision and the full package of crit-
ical new investments.

Mr. DURBIN. I urge my colleagues to 
resist any attempt to remove this pro-

not open the spigot of Federal dollars 
to this predatory industry. They have

enough lives of students as it is. We

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 474 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
since being elected to the U.S. Senate 
about 3 years ago, I have spoken often 
about the dangers presented by com-
munist China. I have not been alone in 
this. Colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle—Republicans, 
Democrats, 
and 
Independents in this body—have been 
vocal about the threats we face from 
General Secretary Xi and his com-
munist regime. 
While we may not always agree on 
the solutions to the problems caused 
by communist China, I feel we are 
united in a truth: the good people of 
China are being brutally oppressed, 
censored, intimidated, and manipu-
lated 
by 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party—a regime that wants nothing 
more than to dominate the world and 
extinguish the democratic values and 
true freedoms we so proudly stand for. 
Communist China’s actions have re-
peatedly made this fact clear to all 
freedom-loving people across the world, 
and its latest attack on liberty and 
freedom of Peng Shuai demand our at-
tention. 
Ms. Shuai is one of China’s most rec-
ognizable athletes. She is a three-time 
Olympian and was ranked the No. 1 
doubles player in 2014 by the Women’s 
Tennis Association. She has won cham-
pionships at Wimbledon and the French 
Open and has represented her country 
at the highest levels of tennis competi-
tion. 
So when she shared her story of sex-
ual abuse by a former Vice Premier of 
the Chinese Communist Party last 
month on social media, it rightfully 
caught the attention of the world. 
And communist China’s reaction to 
these disturbing allegations have both 
shocked us all and completely verified 
all of our fears. 
Instead of taking Ms. Shuai’s claims 
seriously and investigating these alle-
gations, the communist Chinese Gov-
ernment 
followed 
its 
authoritarian 
playbook—silence, deflect, and cover 
up. 
General Secretary Xi and his Com-
munist thugs are so thin-skinned, 
weak, and intolerant of any ques-
tioning of their conduct that the gov-
ernment immediately silenced and dis-
appeared Ms. Shuai. 
For more than 2 weeks, a global out-
cry arose, led by the Women’s Tennis 
Association, asking ‘‘Where is Peng?’’ 
Then, 
communist 
China’s 
state 
media released what it said was an 
email from Ms. Shuai to the Women’s 
Tennis Association reversing her alle-
gations. It read like a hostage note and 
only raised more concerns as to her 
whereabouts and safety. 
Then, the communist Chinese Gov-
ernment shared a couple of videos of 
Ms. Shuai at various structured public 
events and staged two video calls with 
the International Olympic Committee. 
Shockingly, the International Olympic 
Committee didn’t ask about her dis-
appearance. They didn’t ask about her 
allegations of abuse. But are any of us 
surprised? 
I have been pressing the Inter-
national Olympic Committee to speak 
up against communist China’s geno-
cide, attacks on democracy, and other 
abuses for 2 years. They have been 
completely silent. 
The IOC’s failure to ask these ques-
tions reveals it is more interested in 
appeasing 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party and maintaining its good rela-
tionship with a genocidal communist 
regime than the safety of athletes. 
I am not the only one who believes 
this. Last week, world renowned sports 
broadcaster Bob Costas appeared on 
CNN and told the truth that I have 
been sounding the alarm on. The IOC is 
in bed with communist China. It is dis-
gusting, but that is the truth. 
Fortunately, the Women’s Tennis As-
sociation took real action to stand up 
for Ms. Shuai. Last week, the WTA an-
nounced it would be suspending all of 
its events in China until it was clear 
that Ms. Shuai was safe and in good 
health. The WTA is also calling for a 
full-fledged 
and 
completely 
trans-
parent investigation into Ms. Shuai’s 
allegations. 
We should applaud the WTA for doing 
the right thing and showing the world 
how sport can stand up to an evil au-
thoritarian communist regime. This is 
what courage looks like, and I believe 
it ought to be celebrated in this body. 
The IOC, on the other hand, is bending 
over backward to keep communist 
China happy. 
We 
have 
American 
athletes 
and 
coaches traveling to Beijing in just 
weeks. It is terrifying. If communist 
China is willing to do this to its own 
citizens, how do we know Americans 
will be safe during the Olympics? 
We must demand that Ms. Shuai im-
mediately be freed from censorship, co-
ercion, and intimidation, and that 
there be a full investigation into her 
serious allegations of sexual assault 
against former Vice Premier Zhang 
Gaoli. 
That is why I have introduced a reso-
lution calling exactly for that. 
I am thankful that Senators LUMMIS, 
RUBIO, BRAUN, HAWLEY, and CRUZ have 
joined me. The United States is the 
leading voice of freedom and democ-
racy around the world. We cannot tol-
erate this kind of behavior, and I urge 
my colleagues to stand together today 
for human rights and help pass this 
good resolution. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 474, which is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object, Mr. President, if I can be recog-
nized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to my col-
league from Florida, I like your resolu-
tion, and I really think it speaks to the 
sentiment shared by the vast major-
ity—maybe even all of the U.S. Sen-
ators. 
I am not certain how to pronounce 
this young lady’s name—Peng Shuai. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Peng Shuai. 
Mr. DURBIN. Peng Shuai. Well, I will 
accept you as my Mandarin coach and 
refer to her as Peng Shuai. 
It is outrageous. She reports sexual 
abuse by a high-ranking official and 
then she disappears and they feed us 
occasional videotapes. 
Well, I want to join you in com-
mending the Women’s Tennis Associa-
tion, and I also want to add that I

think the President was correct in not 
only saying that we were going to 
withhold any diplomats being sent over 
to China during the next round of the 
Olympic Games, but I understand the 
administration is reaching out to other 
countries to join us. 
Whether it is the Uighers or whether 
it is Ms. Peng Shuai, outrageous 
human rights abuses should not be ig-
nored. And as I glance at your resolu-
tion here, it looks like you hit the nail 
on the head. 
So why am I reserving the right to 
object? 
Here is something that I think would 
be helpful in the cause of human 
rights. What if the United States of 
America actually had an Ambassador 
in China? 
Think about that possibility. We 
would have someone representing our 
country on the scene in Beijing work-
ing for the United States, speaking up 
for human rights. 
Well, what is holding us back? Why 
won’t Biden nominate somebody for 
this job? 
Well, it turns out he did, a man 
named Nicholas Burns. 
Well, we all know him. He has a long 
record of diplomacy in Foreign Serv-
ice—service in Russia and other places. 
He is a key man in the State Depart-
ment and one that we can rely on. And 
he should be in Beijing fighting for the 
causes that you and I agree on today. 
What can possibly be holding him up? 
We need him there. 
Well, it turns out he is being held up 
by that side of the aisle objecting to 
his being called. 
Well, we have a chance to resolve 
that today. We can pass not only your 
resolution, but we can appoint Mr. 
Burns as the Ambassador to China and 
get it done and he could be on a plane 
in the morning. 
How about that? That would be an 
amazing thing to accomplish. You take 
that home to Florida, and I will take 
that home to Illinois. It is a good day’s 
work. 
And so, to reach that end, I ask that 
the pending request be modified as fol-
lows: Notwithstanding rule XXII, the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
the following nomination: Calendar No. 
525, R. Nicholas Burns, of Massachu-
setts, to be Ambassador of the United 
States of America to People’s Republic 
of China; that the nomination be con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action; and then, as if in 
legislative session, the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of your 
resolution, S. Res. 474, submitted ear-
lier today; that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
without intervening action or debate. 
What an amazing bipartisan achieve-
ment that we can put together in just 
a few minutes here. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the 
Senator from Florida so modify his re-
quest? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Reserving the 
right to object, first, I thank my col-
league for agreeing that—I think we all 
agree that what has happened to Peng 
Shuai is wrong, and I think we all 
know we have to stand up to what com-
munist China is doing. 
Here is my concern about Nick 
Burns: Until the day he was nominated 
by President Biden, he had had no 
problems with communist China. He 
has never stood up to communist 
China; he has taken money from com-
munist China; he has always looked 
the other way. 
So my concern is that we ought to 
have a vote on him because everybody 
ought to have the opportunity to talk 
to him and get his position. I have 
talked to him, and he has never ever 
said a word about the Uighurs, about 
the Tibetans, about what happened in 
Hong Kong, about stealing American 
technology. He has never done any of 
those things. So I don’t know how it is 
going to help us. 
I object to the modification, but I 
hope my colleague will agree that the 
resolution itself is worth it to go for-
ward and just do it by themselves, and, 
over time, we will have a vote on Nick 
Burns. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, time is 
wasting. We need an Ambassador to 
China. 
I am sorry, but I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
this is pretty disappointing, all right? 
My Democratic colleague said that 
he agreed with the resolution. I think 
it is time that we stand up for the Chi-
nese citizens who are being oppressed 
by Secretary Xi. 
What this resolution does is say that, 
you know, we have got to stand up to 
all the oppression in China, that we 
have got to stand up for Peng Shuai. 
The resolution says, you know, as for 
the athletes who are going over there, 
we have your backs. Yet, if you look at 
what is happening now, the Democrats 
are saying: We are not going to do 
those things. 
I don’t think that is right. I don’t be-
lieve our platform in the Senate should 
be that we don’t stand for alleged vic-
tims of sexual assault. I think, by not 
having this resolution approved today 
and having the Democrats block it, 
that that is exactly what we are say-
ing. 
So it is pretty disappointing. This 
was a basic resolution that said that 
we were going to stand up for Peng 
Shuai. I am very appreciative of what 
the WTA has done. I am very dis-
appointed with what the NBA has done. 
I am disappointed with what the IOC 
has done. 
I am also disappointed that the Sen-
ate, today, could not come to a resolu-
tion and simply stand up for somebody 
who has accused the Vice Premier of 
China of sexual assault. None of us 
would like that to happen to anybody 
in our families, and we don’t want it to 
happen to anybody in this country. We 
ought to stand up for people in China 
just like we would want them to stand 
up for people in this country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
am here on the floor today to urge the 
Senate to move immediately to vote on 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Dr. 
Laurie 
Locascio to be the Under Secretary of 
Commerce for Standards and Tech-
nology at the Department of Commerce 
and—this is a double-headed position— 
as the Director of the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology. 
As of today, we have 156 pending 
nominations on the executive calendar. 
These include Ambassadorial nomina-
tions 
to 
important 
countries 
like 
China, Japan, and others all around the 
world. It is harming our national secu-
rity. We should be moving forward with 
them urgently. Then there are a whole 
number of nominations that relate to 
very important U.S. domestic Agen-
cies, and one of them is this appoint-
ment at the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology. 
Look, many Americans are aware of 
the NIH, the National Institutes of 
Health. They know that that Institute 
does very important medical research 
that helps save lives and that it devel-
ops treatments to help Americans and 
others around the world. In fact, they 
have played a key role in the develop-
ment of the vaccines against COVID–19. 
Less well-known but also very impor-
tant is the National Institute of Stand-
ards and Technology, which plays a 
key role in supporting American eco-
nomic competitiveness and supporting 
innovation for Americans and Amer-
ican companies around the world. They 
also play an important role in the sup-
ply chain effort of the United States. 
That, of course, has taken on added 
significance in recent months as we ex-
perience bottlenecks. 
So we are only hurting ourselves, and 
we are only hurting our country by re-
fusing to allow this body to move for-
ward on a vote on her nomination. We 
are essentially saying to this very im-
portant institute, this important gov-
ernment entity: We are not going to 
vote on your leader. So it is time to 
move forward on this. 
Now, I want to talk a little bit about 
why Dr. Locascio is an exceptional 
choice for this role. It is not only be-
cause she hails from the great State of 
Maryland; it is not only because she is 
a graduate of the University of Mary-
land, Baltimore and that she has been

December 8, 2021 
a leader of the University of Mary-
land’s research endeavors since 2017; 
but it is also—and most importantly— 
because she brings to this position 
three decades of experience in working 
at all levels at NIST, the institute to 
which she has been nominated to lead. 
She began her time at the Agency as 
a research staffer and rose to become 
the Acting Principal Deputy Director 
and Associate Director for Laboratory 
Programs. She was responsible for di-
recting 
the 
Material 
Measurement 
Laboratory, which is one of NIST’s 
largest laboratories. She also has very 
intimate knowledge of NIST from her 
other years of experience there, and 
she has really touched upon every area 
of endeavor within the NIST portfolio. 
As I indicated, this appointment 
would be important at any time, but it 
is especially important at this moment 
as we grapple with supply chain issues 
and as we try to bolster U.S. manufac-
turing and try to make sure that we 
manufacture 
here, 
in 
the 
United 
States, essential products that we 
need. 
This body, in addition to focusing on 
the manufacturing side of the ledger, 
also understands the importance of in-
vestment in vital research and mate-
rials science, in things like quantum 
computing and artificial intelligence. 
We passed, with an overwhelming bi-
partisan vote of 68 to 32, the U.S. Inno-
vation and Competition Act, and NIST 
has very important responsibilities in 
those areas. What NIST does there is 
very important in our maintaining and 
sharpening our position in the world, 
especially as we address the growing 
challenge of China. 
I also want to mention the Manufac-
turing Extension Partnership that is 
run out of NIST, which plays a very 
important role right now as we work to 
fight these supply chain blockages and 
also accelerate the production of per-
sonal protective equipment—N95 masks 
and ventilators. That push was fueled, 
largely, by the $50 million that this 
body helped to appropriate for the MEP 
program in the CARES Act. Again, 
that is a program housed in NIST that 
is helping to deal with supply chain 
bottlenecks when it comes to essential 
protections from the pandemic. 
So there is no justification for block-
ing this nomination. In fact, all we are 
doing is tying our hands behind our 
backs by depriving this important in-
stitute of their top leader at a time 
when we face national challenges on 
supply chain issues and at a time when 
we understand we have got to be at the 
top of our game when it comes to inno-
vation and cutting-edge technologies 
in so many areas where it is essential 
to meet the challenge of China and oth-
ers around the world in global competi-
tion. So I would really urge my col-
leagues to allow this nomination to 
proceed. It is the right thing to do for 
our country. 
Mr. President, at this point in time, 
I ask unanimous consent that, not-
withstanding rule XXII, the Senate 
consider the following nomination: Ex-
ecutive Calendar No. 551, Department 
of Commerce, Laurie E. Locascio, of 
Maryland, to be Under Secretary of 
Commerce for Standards and Tech-
nology; that the nomination be con-
firmed; that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order on the nomination; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
First, I want to acknowledge my col-
league’s interest in the nominee for the 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology. 
I am not sure if my colleague is 
aware, but, last month, I sent a letter 
to the Commerce Committee, inform-
ing them that I would be holding all 
Department of Transportation and De-
partment of Commerce nominees until 
the committee hears testimony from 
Secretary Raimondo and Secretary 
Buttigieg about the supply chain crisis. 
Right now, there are nearly 100 ships 
waiting to dock in California ports to 
unload their goods, but they are unable 
to do so because of President Biden’s 
supply chain crisis. Christmas is just a 
couple of weeks away, and families and 
businesses are facing empty shelves, 
shortages on goods, and higher prices. 
So far, as far as I can tell, I have only 
seen Secretary Buttigieg and Secretary 
Raimondo play TV commentator rath-
er than actually go out to California 
and solve the problems. 
It is long past time for the Biden ad-
ministration to tell us exactly what 
they are doing to solve this crisis and 
help American families. Until we hear 
from Secretary Buttigieg and Sec-
retary Raimondo in the Commerce 
Committee, I will be objecting to all 
Commerce and Transportation nomi-
nees going through an expedited proc-
ess here in the Senate. 
This isn’t personal. It is about ac-
countability. I look forward to hearing 
from Secretary Raimondo and Sec-
retary Buttigieg and then going for-
ward with these nominees. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
would just ask my colleague, in the 
coming days, before the end of the 
year, to reconsider his position. 
He is a member of the Commerce 
Committee, and he knows well that 
there have been three hearings on sup-
ply chain issues, one on May 11 regard-
ing ‘‘Freight Mobility: Strengthening 
America’s Supply’’; on July 15, ‘‘Imple-
menting Supply Chain Resiliency’’; and 
on December 7, ‘‘Unchartered Waters: 
Challenges Posed by Ocean Shipping 
Supply Chains,’’ where the committee 
discussed a whole range of supply chain 
issues. 
Moreover, responding to these issues, 
if we are really serious about address-
ing our supply chain issues, how does it 
help to deny us the opportunity to vote 
and put in place the Director of an 
Agency that is supposed to help relieve 
the supply chain bottlenecks? 
I know the Senator from Florida had 
to leave, but it is a very simple ques-
tion. If there is a genuine interest in 
addressing supply chain bottlenecks 
and addressing the cost pressures, how 
does denying NIST a leader help ad-
vance that agenda? Clearly, it does not. 
Clearly, this is harming the U.S. mar-
kets at this important time. Clearly, it 
is harming our supply chain efforts. 
Clearly, it is harming U.S. competi-
tiveness. 
So I urge my colleagues to move for-
ward on this nomination. Apparently 
not today because of the objection, but 
let’s get it done before the end of this 
year. 
I am not going to ask for a quorum 
call. Thank you. That is it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
VACCINE MANDATE 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor of the Senate today to 
make a few points and ask a few ques-
tions. 
First of all, can we all acknowledge 
that there is so much that we do not 
know about the coronavirus, about 
COVID, the disease, or about the 
COVID 
vaccines? 
Our 
response 
to 
COVID, as a result, has been a reaction 
to very imperfect information. 
So, very early in the pandemic, I 
gave those individuals in a position to 
have to make very tough decisions 
with imperfect information a great 
deal of latitude in making those tough 
calls, but over the course of the 
months, we have learned a lot. 
We have always been told to follow 
the science, but it sure seems our 
healthcare Agencies—as I refer to 
them, the COVID gods; the Dr. Faucis 
of the world, the Agency heads, the 
Biden administration, the mainstream 
media, and social media—have never 
allowed second opinions. There has 
been one narrative, and they simply 
have not been willing to consider alter-
native measures. 
So a question I think we should all be 
asking ourselves is, Does that response 
work? Over 780,000 Americans have lost 
their lives. The human toll of the eco-
nomic devastation of the shutdowns, 
the year of lost learning for our chil-
dren, the psychological harm to our 
children, the record overdose deaths, 
the increase in suicides—I don’t know 
how you can take a look at America’s 
death rate—the last time I looked, it 
was a couple weeks old; about 220 per 
100,000 population. By the way, Sweden 
was at 145 per 100,000 a couple of weeks 
ago. I don’t see how anybody can take 
a look at the response imposed in our 
country by the COVID gods and say it 
was a success. 
So acknowledging the fact that there 
is still so much we don’t know, I would

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9020 
December 8, 2021 
appreciate a little modesty on the part 
of the COVID gods. I would appreciate 
that we actually follow the advice that 
I have always heard when dealing with 
a serious medical condition: Get a sec-
ond opinion. Get a third opinion. As I 
said, that is not allowed. 
I think it also calls for a little re-
spect for our fellow citizens. These are 
some tough decisions. They are tough 
decisions whether or not you want to 
get vaccinated. 
Even more gut-wrenching than tough 
decisions based on these idiotic and 
pointless vaccine mandates is, do I sub-
ject to the coercion, to the pressure, to 
the fear of reprisal and take the jab or 
lose my job? These are tough decisions. 
I am a big supporter of Operation 
Warp Speed. I have had every vaccina-
tion until this one because I had 
COVID. The COVID gods aren’t ac-
knowledging natural immunity. They 
are not acknowledging vaccine inju-
ries. They are not acknowledging the 
fact that even if you are fully vac-
cinated, you can still get COVID and 
you can still transmit COVID. So what 
is the point of a mandate? But, of 
course, that is not what we are getting 
from the COVID gods. 
This weekend, something happened 
that is not unusual. My words were 
taken completely out of context, twist-
ed, distorted, and I was relentlessly at-
tacked. 
I would like to respond to those at-
tacks that were headlined: 
‘‘Fauci calls Ron Johnson’s AIDS 
comment ‘preposterous.’’’ 
Fauci said: 
I don’t have any clue of what he’s talking 
about. 
‘‘Fauci Blasts Ron Johnson for Say-
ing He ‘Overhyped’ AIDS: ‘Prepos-
terous!’’’ 
‘‘Anthony Fauci Rips GOP Sen. Ron 
Johnson’s 
‘Preposterous’ Accusation 
He’s ‘Overhyped’ COVID.’’ 
So what did I say? That sounds ter-
rible. Well, what I said was in response 
to 
radio 
talk 
show 
host 
Brian 
Kilmeade’s question asking about the 
Omicron variant. 
He said: It looks benign. I mean, mild 
symptoms; mostly people under 40. 
So I answered his question about Om-
icron, talking about Muller’s ratchet. 
It is a phenomenon. It makes sense— 
how viruses generally mutate, how 
they become more contagious because 
they want to replicate, so they become 
more contagious but generally less le-
thal because it doesn’t have replication 
if you kill your host. Now, nothing is 
guaranteed, but that would be the gen-
eral direction of the variants of the 
coronavirus. Why would we assume 
anything worse? But that is what the 
COVID gods are doing. They are assum-
ing the worse. They are using every 
new variant to keep us in the state of 
fear that they have created to main-
tain control over our lives and rob us 
of our freedom, to impose freedom-rob-
bing vaccine mandates, again, that are 
preposterous—there is a good use of 
that word—that are pointless, that are 
idiotic. 
But after talking about that state of 
fear, I went on to say: 
By the way, Fauci did the exact same 
thing with AIDS. He overhyped it. 
Now, full stop, that is where the news 
media stopped and then accused me, 
falsely, of downplaying AIDS. I have 
never, nor would I ever downplay the 
tragedy that is AIDS, that is COVID. 
These are serious, deadly diseases. 
They have killed hundreds of thou-
sands. I would never downplay them. 
When I said ‘‘overhyped,’’ I explained 
exactly what I was talking about in the 
next six words. I said: 
He created all kinds of fear, saying it could 
affect the entire population when it couldn’t. 
. . . [H]e’s using the exact same playbook 
[for] COVID. 
Here is the key point that I want to 
talk about a little bit later: ignoring 
therapy, pushing a vaccine. The solu-
tion to this pandemic, I have always 
thought, was early treatment. We still 
haven’t robustly explored early treat-
ment, and that is a travesty. 
Now, Dr. Fauci wanted to show us 
that this criticism of him, creating a 
state of fear, is preposterous, but let’s 
go to what he actually said back in 
May of 1983. 
Now, I was alive in May of 1983. I un-
derstand how unsettling this new dis-
ease was. I understand the state of 
fear, the legitimate state of fear. But 
responsible health officials should not 
have stoked it, and Dr. Fauci did. He 
authored an article in the Journal of 
the 
American 
Medical 
Association 
stating ‘‘the possibility that routine 
close contact, as within [any] family 
household, can spread the disease.’’ He 
added: 
If indeed the latter is true, then AIDS 
takes on an entirely new dimension. 
And then: 
If we add to this the possibility that non-
sexual, non-blood-borne transmission is pos-
sible, the scope of the syndrome may be 
enormous. 
Now, it is important to note that 
these aren’t off-the-cuff comments; 
this is in a column he wrote with fore-
thought. Dr. Fauci knew what a deli-
cate time we were in as the public 
awareness of this disease was emerg-
ing, when people were already fright-
ened by what they were hearing. He 
was in a position of authority. He knew 
what he said carried weight and would 
be disseminated, and it was. 
The following day’s headlines—the 
United Press International published a 
story headlined ‘‘Household contact 
may transmit AIDS.’’ The next day, 
the Associated Press ran a story asking 
‘‘Does AIDS spread by routine con-
tact?’’ The same day, the New York 
Times article read ‘‘Family Contact 
Studied in Transmitting AIDS,’’ and it 
invoked Fauci’s article in discussing 
the possibility of transmission between 
family members. 
He stoked the fear, and it, quite hon-
estly, continues to this day. He stig-
matized AIDS patients for years with 
his fearmongering. 
Now, less than 2 months later, in 
June of 1983, Dr. Fauci flip-flopped and 
he 
publicly 
contradicted 
his 
own 
fearmongering by stating: 
It is absolutely preposterous— 
He likes that word, by the way— 
It is absolutely preposterous to suggest 
that AIDS can be contracted through normal 
social contact [by] being in the same room 
with someone or sitting on a bus with them. 
I mean, you heard what he said 2 
months earlier, right? If he felt it was 
so preposterous on June 26, why had he 
raised the fear, stoked the fear, just 2 
months earlier? 
It is interesting. I just found out last 
night that not only did he write that 
article stoking the fear, he started giv-
ing interviews. I have seen an inter-
view where he basically used the exact 
same words. But now he denies it. He 
wants to deny the reality of what he 
said and what he did. He wants to re-
write history. 
By the way, when it comes to the 
AIDS crisis, rewriting history, I am 
not the only one who is accusing him 
of that. In an article published—or up-
dated last on December 6 in 2017, in the 
Huffington Post, in their comment 
platform, which I guess has since been 
taken down, an author of a book—his 
name is Sean Strub—wrote an article— 
wrote a blog for HuffPost. 
The book Mr. Strub wrote was ‘‘Body 
Counts: A Memoir of Politics, Sex, 
AIDS, and Survival.’’ And he describes 
it, as he recounts how slow the Federal 
Government was in publicizing the use 
of Bactrim and other sulfa drugs to 
prevent PCP, which is the pneumonia 
that was then the leading killer of peo-
ple with AIDS, in addition to its long-
time and well-known use to treat that 
type of pneumonia. 
So let me quote from Mr. Strub’s ar-
ticle. He said: 
Dr. Anthony Fauci is rewriting history. He 
is doing so to disguise his shameful role in 
delaying promotion of an AIDS treatment 
that would have prevented tens of thousands 
of deaths in the first years of the epidemic. 
The article goes on to say: 
In 1987, pioneering AIDS activist Michael 
Callen begged Fauci for help in promoting 
the use of Bactrim as PCP prophylaxis and 
issuing interim guidelines urging physicians 
to prophylax those patients deemed at high 
risk for PCP. 
The article goes on: 
Had Fauci listened to people with AIDS 
and the clinicians treating them, and re-
sponded accordingly, he would have saved 
thousands of lives. In the two years between 
1987, when Callen met with Fauci and 1989, 
when the guidelines were ultimately issued, 
nearly 17,000 people with AIDS suffocated 
from PCP. Most of these people might have 
lived had Fauci responded appropriately. 
Another doctor, Dr. Barry Gingell—I 
am continuing with the article here— 
a medical advisor to Gay Men’s Health Cri-
sis, met with Fauci to plead for his support, 
they didn’t just say there was ‘‘this prelimi-
nary activity and some small trials,’’ as 
Fauci claims. They explained that many 
frontline AIDS physicians, following the lead 
of Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, were already using 
Bactrim effectively to prevent the recur-
rence of PCP. The science was clear. A dec-
ade before, clinical trials by Dr. Walter

Hughes had proven its efficacy in preventing 
PCP in other immune-compromised popu-
lations, like children with leukemia. 
It continues: 
Fauci refused to acknowledge the evidence 
and, according to one account, even encour-
aged people with AIDS to stop taking treat-
ments, like Bactrim, that weren’t specifi-
cally approved for use in people with AIDS. 
Dr. Sonnabend wrote in 2006: 
Why, in the case of AIDS, was Bactrim, a 
known preventative measure against PCP, 
introduced so many years after a need for it 
had been recognized? To this must be added 
the question of why this neglect, the con-
sequences of which can be measured in the 
tens of thousands of lives lost, has received 
almost no attention. 
The media has continued to cover for 
Dr. Fauci. 
The article goes on: 
If we don’t tell the truth about the history 
of the AIDS epidemic, it will be subject to 
more whitewashing— 
As we witnessed this weekend. My 
aside. 
—more distortions and more rewriting to 
suit the legacies of the officials in charge. 
These are the same officials who seem in-
capable of ever acknowledging or taking re-
sponsibility for mistakes they made—mis-
takes that cost our community thousands of 
lives. 
Now, why did I take so much time to 
read an excerpt from this article from 
2017? 
It is because it is the major point I 
was making in my comments to Brian 
Kilmeade. Dr. Fauci, he is using the 
exact same playbook for COVID as he 
did for AIDS: ignoring therapy like 
Bactrim or the cornucopia of cheap, ge-
neric, repurposed drugs that are avail-
able, that are being used successfully 
to treat COVID and save lives. 
The solution, I have always felt, has 
always been early treatment. But, 
again, Dr. Fauci is ignoring therapy 
and pushing a vaccine. 
Why? 
There are multiple medical experts 
who have looked at this, who are treat-
ing COVID, who are doing the research, 
who say upwards of 500,000 lives were 
needlessly lost because we ignored and, 
I would argue, sabotaged early treat-
ment with cheap, generic, repurposed 
drugs. 
In fact, the FDA completely trash- 
talked one of these repurposed drugs, a 
Nobel Prize-winning drug termed by 
the World Health Organization as a 
miracle drug, Ivermectin, calling it 
horse paste; saying: Come on, you all; 
you are not cows. 
Fake news stories saying that people 
are lining up, clogging hospitals be-
cause of overdoses of Ivermectin, only 
to find out that is a completely false 
news story—like false studies published 
in medical journals that had to be 
withdrawn 2 weeks later early in the 
pandemic, which also poisoned the use 
of some of these repurposed drugs. 
Let’s take a look at some facts. Let’s 
take a look at some facts that, when I 
go on media and I describe these facts, 
I am censored by the COVID gods; I am 
removed from YouTube, as is some-
times the radio talk show host. 
But let’s look at the facts of drugs 
versus the vaccine. Now, many of you 
will be shocked by this because this is 
all being censored. This information, 
this is not allowed. Again, there is one 
narrative; it is the narrative of the 
COVID gods. No second or third opin-
ions are allowed. No questions are al-
lowed to be asked, much less answered. 
So let’s take a look at Ivermectin. I 
have got two columns here: Total ad-
verse events reported to either the 
FAERS system—the adverse event re-
porting system from the FDA for 
drugs—and the VAERS system—the 
vaccine adverse event system reported 
through the CDC. 
So the top three. First of all, 
Ivermectin. Over 26 years—26 years of 
reporting—Ivermectin has about 3,756 
adverse events reported in through 
FAERS. So that is adverse events. In 
terms of deaths, it averages about 15 
reports of deaths per year. 
Now, let’s get something straight 
here. There are two main criticisms of 
FAERS and VAERS. It doesn’t prove 
causation. I get that. But it also dra-
matically 
understates 
the 
adverse 
events. 
So, again, we are going to use this as 
a comparison. 
Ivermectin: 15 deaths per year, on av-
erage, over 26 years of usage. 
Hydroxychloroquine: 23,355 total ad-
verse events over 26 years. On average, 
about 69 deaths—death reports per 
year. 
How about the seasonal flu vaccine? 
Again, 26 years’ worth of history: 
198,776 total adverse events reported on 
VAERS, but an average of 80 deaths per 
year for the seasonal flu vaccine. 
I look at these, and I go: These are 
pretty safe drugs. No drug is 100 per-
cent safe. No human body is exactly 
the same. But you have to look at 
these drugs as having a very safe and 
reliable safety profile. 
So if you have COVID—and let’s face 
it, the current NIH guideline on COVID 
is to do nothing: go home, foray it 
alone, isolate yourself, hope you don’t 
get so sick you have to check yourself 
into a hospital. 
The only thing they are recom-
mending for use is monoclonal anti-
bodies. Try and get those. I have talked 
to so many constituents that haven’t 
been able to. Either they are not sick 
enough or they become too sick or it 
has taken too long. 
So, virtually, the NIH guideline con-
tinues to this day: Do nothing. 
Now, a quick aside: How many other 
diseases is that the recommendation? 
Isn’t it always early detection allows 
for early treatment, produces better 
outcome? 
Of course, that is what we rec-
ommend for every other disease, except 
COVID because Fauci ignored therapies 
and pushed vaccines. He has just been— 
he has got his blinders on. It is vac-
cines, vaccines, vaccines. 
And then they scaremonger both 
Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. 
I don’t know. Are you afraid of those? 
If you have got COVID, would you give 
those a shot? 
I certainly would. And, by the way, I 
am not a doctor; I am not a medical re-
searcher. But I have been in contact 
with doctors who have the courage and 
compassion to treat. And so when I 
have a friend or a constituent who calls 
me and says, ‘‘What can I do?’’ I refer 
them to a doctor who treats them. 
And I have example after example of 
these things working, keeping people 
out of hospitals and certainly pre-
venting death. I know it is anecdotal, 
but the evidence is mounting, and it is 
getting to the point of being—I think it 
is at the point of being irrefutable. 
So now let’s compare this to the 
drugs of choice of Dr. Fauci and the 
COVID gods. Let’s take a look at 
Remdesivir. The studies were weak. 
They changed the endpoint of reducing 
death—because it didn’t—to reducing 
days in the hospital. But they still 
rushed through the emergency use au-
thorization, and it has been the treat-
ment, because it is blessed by the 
COVID gods, that hospitals will apply. 
Now, in fairness, hospitals also do 
dexamethasone. They will do other 
things—corticosteroids. 
Pierre 
Kory 
testified before my committee in May 
of 2020 about corticosteroids. 
But Remdesivir is the big one; over 
$3,000 a dose when these cost 20 to 50 
bucks, total, as part of a multidrug, 
multivitamin—vitamin 
D, 
zinc. 
Remdesivir: 6,500 adverse events. I 
don’t have it here. 1,612 deaths so far 
since it has got its emergency use. 
That is an average of 921 a year. That 
is Remdesivir. 
Now let’s look at the COVID vaccine, 
and this will shock you. It should 
shock you because nobody is talking 
about it. And when a guy like me talks 
about it, I get censored, I get vilified, I 
get attacked. 
927,740 total adverse events. And, re-
member, one of the criticisms is 
VAERS dramatically understates the 
number of adverse events. 
Total deaths: 19,532. Now, again, I re-
alize VAERS doesn’t prove causation, 
but almost 6,000 of these worldwide 
deaths occurred on days 0, 1, or 2 fol-
lowing vaccination. 
I 
know 
Fauci, 
I 
know 
Janet 
Woodcock, I know Francis Collins are 
not concerned about this. I am con-
cerned about this. Other people who 
have been able to avoid the censors and 
see this, they are concerned about it. 
They are making those tough choices. 
They also realize COVID can be a dead-
ly disease. They have to make an in-
formed decision whether or not to get 
vaccinated. 
Shouldn’t they have all the informa-
tion? 
But they are not being given all the 
information. It is about time they are. 
Let me conclude by just asking—for 
the audience, really—why do I continue 
to push these truths? 
And they are truths. There is no mis-
information up here. This is the truth. 
These aren’t my numbers. This isn’t 
my data. This is the CDC and the 
FDA’s data.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9022 
December 8, 2021 
Why do I continue to talk about 
these things when I get attacked, when 
I get vilified, when I get ridiculed, 
when I get censored? 
It is pretty simple. It is because I 
have 
acknowledged 
the 
vaccine-in-
jured. I have held events to let them 
tell their stories—like little Maddie de 
Garay, 12 years old. Now she is 13. She 
participated in the Pfizer trial. She is 
in a wheelchair. She can’t eat. She has 
a feeding tube. 
Pfizer has ignored her, cast her aside. 
They are not paying for her medical 
bills. That is a scandal right then and 
there. Brianne Dressen participated in 
the AstraZeneca trial: paralyzed from 
the waist down. Fortunately, she has 
gotten her leg function back. But she is 
not whole. She is not cured. 
Ernest Ramirez: he lost his only son, 
his best friend. He is a single dad. 
I have given the vaccine-injured—the 
survivors, I have given them a forum to 
tell their stories, and the media just 
shrugs. All they want is to be seen and 
heard and believed so they can be cured 
or so they can prevent other people 
from experiencing their trauma. 
The real reason I continue to tell the 
truth—although I am attacked—is be-
cause not only have I given these indi-
viduals a forum to tell their stories, 
but I have seen their tears. I have 
hugged the vaccine-injured, the sur-
viving spouses, the surviving parents, 
the surviving children. 
Why won’t we acknowledge these 
truths? Why won’t we acknowledge the 
vaccine-injured? 
Until we do, until we acknowledge 
what the root cause of the illness 
might be, how is there any hope of 
healing them? 
So again, our response to COVID has 
been a miserable failure. We must ac-
knowledge that. We can’t deny reality. 
We need to embrace early treatment 
because we are going to continue to 
need early treatment. 
The vaccines aren’t 100 percent guar-
anteed effective. New variants will 
emerge. We are going to have to treat. 
Better start now and might as well 
give these cheap generic, widely avail-
able drugs a shot. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the appropriations process for the fis-
cal year 2022, in particular, the Home-
land Security bill, where I serve as 
ranking member of that subcommittee. 
Unfortunately, as I stand here today, 
as all of us know, in December, there is 
still no clear path for the fiscal year 
2022 bills. And you know, that is a real 
shame, and I am going to talk about 
that. 
Every year, it is a challenge to come 
up with a bipartisan bill. It is difficult 
to fund the government. But every 
year, we manage to do it. The main 
reason being that we have agreed on 
certain 
rules—rules 
that 
transcend 
unique political situations, where both 
sides know that you are required in 
order to reach an agreement. We real-
ize we have to give on each side. 
These rules are what Vice Chairman 
SHELBY has been insisting we agree on 
now so we can proceed with meaningful 
negotiations. So I support Vice Chair-
man SHELBY, and I encourage my Dem-
ocrat colleagues to come to the table, 
akin to the Shelby-Leahy agreements 
of the past. This isn’t a partisan de-
mand, but, rather, an appeal that we 
all recognize at the outset what is so 
obviously necessary for us to achieve 
an outcome at the end of the day. 
As the ranking member of the Home-
land 
Security 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee, I come today to address 
that bill. I have been pleased over the 
past year to work with our new chair-
man, Chairman MURPHY, on our sub-
committee. We have had several meet-
ings. And, thankfully, there are vast 
areas of agreement between us on a 
majority of issues. I look forward to 
continuing to work with him to ad-
vance agreement for the FY22 Home-
land Security bill. 
A full-year continuing resolution 
would be a massive challenge for the 
Department of Homeland Security. We 
know we have a continuing resolution 
going until February. 
Like all Agencies—and I argue prob-
ably more than most Agencies—DHS 
exists in a dynamic, ever-evolving 
threat environment, and its priorities 
and commensurate funding levels must 
be updated through the Appropriations 
Committee. 
Further, the DHS is personnel heavy, 
and we need to ensure that funding 
keeps up with the salaries and the ben-
efits of the public servants in this De-
partment who are striving every day to 
keep our Nation safe. 
We also need to invest in our Coast 
Guard and our Coast Guard readiness, 
which is a part of this bill, and ensure 
that its important procurement efforts 
remain on schedule. I think we have 
great agreement on all of that. 
So in the midst of the holiday season, 
we all know the critical work of the 
men and women of the TSA. And more 
recently, we, as a nation, are relying 
more and more on the constant dili-
gence of the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure 
Security 
Agency—CISA— 
otherwise known as someone trying to 
keep us safe in cyber space. 
These Agencies and all those within 
the Department stand ready to protect 
the homeland. But we in Congress seem 
ill-prepared when it comes time to sup-
porting and furthering their efforts. 
So that being said—and I know 
Chairman MURPHY
and I agree on 
this—I loathe the fact that a CR would 
enable and pretty much encourage the 
Department to reprogram money at 
their own will, aside from the intention 
of Congress. 
So let’s secure a framework because, 
don’t forget, we are talking here in the 
midst of a continuing crisis on our 
southern border. Democrats have cited 
the supposed reduction in border en-
counters as evidence that President 
Biden and Vice President KAMALA HAR-
RIS’s immigration policies are working. 
It is true that encounters have gone 
down. They have gone down from 
record highs in July to record highs in 
October. That is right, this October’s 
numbers, which are the last numbers 
that we have, were the highest re-
corded numbers of any October in his-
tory. And that is astonishing. 
You can see from the chart how the 
blue is the average from 2013 to 2020 of 
encounters. And you can see from Jan-
uary on how exponentially higher all of 
these encounters have been. We have 
real problems, particularly at the bor-
der, that need to be addressed. 
So while a long-term CR would be 
bad, as I have already discussed, a full- 
year FY22 bill that does not address 
these real problems at our border is not 
reasonable either. But that is what the 
majority’s Homeland bill does. 
Literally, the first sentence of the 
summary says: ‘‘The fiscal year 2022 
Homeland Security bill provides discre-
tionary funding of $71.7 billion, which 
is $65 million less than [what] the 
President’s . . . [asked in his budget] 
and $136 million less than the . . . 2021 
enacted level’’ that we are living under 
right now. 
That is right, the DHS bill, intro-
duced by the majority that we are now 
told is better for the Department than 
a CR, actually reduces funding from 
last year’s levels. 
For example, for Customs and Border 
Protection—they 
are 
on 
the 
front 
line—the bill provides $14.5 billion, $80 
million below the President’s budget 
request, and $501 million below fiscal 
year 2021 enacted. 
So the DHS Agency directly respon-
sible for border security, with these 
numbers right here—the one that is 
overwhelmed by these numbers—would 
receive less funding than requested by 
President Biden and, yes, less funding 
that is being provided right now under 
this continuing resolution. 
The same is true for Immigration and 
Customs, known as ICE, the Agency re-
sponsible for removing migrants who 
received due process and are ordered 
removed. 
Again, I quote, for ICE, ‘‘the bill pro-
vides $7.9 billion, $58 million below the 
President’s budget request, and $40 mil-
lion below’’ the enacted level that we 
are operating under now in 2021. 
Once again, another account vital to 
enforcing our immigration laws cut 
from what we are operating under the 
CR. 
So what is in the majority’s bill that 
is being sold as border security? 
This is what they have chosen to 
highlight: $175 million for medical 
services for migrants who arrive at the 
border—by the way, the Department of 
Health and Human Services has an 
enormous amount of money in their 
budget—$130 million for three new per-
manent processing facilities, and $25

million for increased transportation 
costs. 
All of these investments mistake bor-
der security with border crisis manage-
ment. These numbers are not going to 
go down if this is where we put our dol-
lars. Some of these may be necessary 
expenses—a reality of opening under 
what is ostensibly open border policies. 
But they will do nothing to stop illegal 
border crossings and maybe even facili-
tate the administration’s catch-and-re-
lease programs. 
And what else would the majority 
bill do? 
It would rescind $1.9 billion in border 
wall system funding that we have had 
in the previous years. 
Is taking away money for a border 
wall system that our Border Patrol has 
been asking for decades and decades—is 
that border security? 
You know, this isn’t just Trump’s 
border wall. We also built miles and 
miles of extremely useful and effective 
border wall under President Obama— 
and it was wall that you could barely 
distinguish sometimes with the naked 
eye from recent border wall. 
Is rescinding that money good for 
border security? 
I say no. 
Is rescinding that money better for 
border security than a continuing reso-
lution, which I must point out would 
actually provide an additional $1.375 
for more border wall system? 
I will say it again, and you can see it 
on the chart: illegal border crossings 
remain at a record high. We need to 
squash this delusion that things are 
getting better. The American public is 
well aware that they aren’t. Therefore, 
we need to provide the proper resources 
to the Agencies in charge to fix the 
problem, not perpetuate the crisis. 
So let me reiterate what I said at the 
start. Nobody wants a full-year CR. We 
need to come together as Democrats 
and Republicans, in the spirit of true 
compromise, to avoid that outcome. 
We can only do that if we understand 
each other’s true interests. 
Allow me to cite another telling line 
from the majority’s Homeland Security 
summary that I have mentioned before. 
Listed in their key points and high-
lights for Homeland Security, the very 
first one that they list, is: ‘‘Addressing 
impacts of Climate Change and Im-
proving Climate Resilience.’’ 
They don’t mention No. 1 border se-
curity. They don’t mention No. 1 cyber 
security. They don’t mention No. 1 dis-
aster relief and recovery, which is in 
Homeland Security. They don’t men-
tion the Coast Guard. They don’t even 
mention the scourge we see on all of 
our States of drug overdoses. And this 
Homeland Security is charged with 
drug interdiction. 
To me, that says a lot. It says a lot, 
and it is not going to get us to the ne-
gotiation table. 
As I have said to the administration, 
as I say to my Democrat colleagues, as 
Chairman MURPHY and I have talked 
about, I think we are both ready and 
willing to work towards a solution. 
Americans deserve our efforts to reach 
a bipartisan consensus, but that will 
only happen by following precedent and 
a willingness to compromise. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to call for every Sen-
ator to have the opportunity to cast 
their vote on the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act. 
I started calling for this up-or-down 
vote since May 24, because I knew—sex-
ual assault survivor advocates knew— 
that if the Armed Services Committee 
leadership had the chance, they would 
strip the provision out of the NDAA be-
hind closed doors, despite the over-
whelming support the bill has in both 
the Senate and House. That is exactly 
what has just happened. 
Time and time again, I have asked on 
this floor for the same opportunity to 
have an up-or-down vote. Time and 
time again, I have heard the same false 
promise that we would proceed under 
regular order and that the will of the 
Members of this body would be re-
spected. 
I was told that ‘‘the best way to 
move forward on this issue is to ensure 
that all 26 members of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee have their voices heard 
and to consider this legislation in the 
course of the markup of the fiscal year 
2022 Defense bill,’’ and that it was ‘‘the 
traditional means of making these de-
cisions.’’ 
I was assured that ‘‘fulsome debate 
during committee markup of the an-
nual defense bill . . . is the hallmark of 
our committee. It ensures that every-
one’s voice is heard.’’ And here on this 
very floor, I heard that ‘‘all amend-
ments offered by Senators on the com-
mittee will be fully considered during 
the full committee markup’’ and ‘‘that 
is, in fact, the tradition of the com-
mittee. If a Member wants a vote on 
amendments, we will vote.’’ 
So we took it to the committee, we 
had the fulsome debate, and we voted. 
The Military Justice Improvement and 
Increasing Prevention Act was in-
cluded in the Senate Armed Services’ 
NDAA bill and passed out of committee 
23 to 3. That is a pretty decisive vote. 
But despite all of the claims that we 
would follow regular procedure and 
that everyone’s voices would be heard, 
when the doors closed for the con-
ference, the story changed. Our votes 
were not respected. Our voices were si-
lenced. Those promises were broken. 
The House and Senate Armed Services 
leadership gutted our bipartisan mili-
tary justice reforms, stripped them 
from the NDAA, and did a disservice to 
our servicemembers and our democ-
racy. 
Committee leadership has ignored 
the will of a filibuster-proof majority 
in the Senate and a majority of the 
House in order to do the bidding of the 
Pentagon. This is an act of blatant dis-
regard for the servicemembers, vet-
erans, and survivors who have fought 
for an impartial and independent mili-
tary justice system that is worthy of 
the sacrifice they make every day for 
our country. 
Committee leadership has also ig-
nored President Biden, our Commander 
in Chief’s public support for moving 
felonies from the chain of command 
and fallen short of even the limited re-
forms that Secretary of Defense Austin 
called for that would have removed sex 
crimes from the chain of command. De-
spite claims otherwise, the NDAA does 
not remove sex crimes from the chain 
of command because the commander 
remains the convening authority, a 
central role to the military justice sys-
tem. Every single court-martial will 
still begin with the words: 
This court-martial was convened by order 
of the commander. 
Commanders can still pick the jury, 
select the witnesses, and allow service-
members accused of crimes the option 
of separation from service instead of 
facing a court-martial—a total denial 
of justice. 
We know that removing convening 
authority from commanders is critical 
to providing a system that is fair and 
perceived to be fair by the servicemem-
bers. To quote Secretary Austin’s own 
panel: 
The DoD’s Office of the Special Victim 
Prosecutor structure must be, and must be 
seen as, independent of the chains of com-
mand of the victim and of the accused all the 
way through the Secretaries of the Military 
Departments. Anything less will likely be 
seen as compromising what is designed to be 
an independent part of the military justice 
process, thus significantly undermining this 
recommendation. . . . Finally, because of the 
breadth and depth of the lack of trust by 
junior enlisted Service members in com-
manders— 
The IRC goes on— 
it was determined that the status quo or any 
variation on the status quo that retained 
commanders as disposition authorities in 
sexual harassment, sexual assault, and re-
lated cases would fail to offer the change re-
quired to restore confidence in the system. 
That was Secretary Austin’s own 
panel. 
The NDAA bill does not provide 
meaningful change to the status quo. 
Our bill would provide it by moving se-
rious crimes like sexual assault out of 
the chain of command completely, put-
ting them in the hands of the most ca-
pable people in the military—those 
independent, impartial, highly trained, 
uniformed prosecutors. That is a sys-
tem our servicemembers can trust. I 
know that because that is the reform 
that survivors have asked for over and 
over and over again. 
Since I started calling for this vote 
in May, we estimate that more than 
11,000 servicemembers will have been 
raped or sexually assaulted and more 
will have been victims of other serious 
crimes. Two in three of those survivors 
will not even report those crimes be-
cause they know that under the cur-
rent system, they are more likely to

face retaliation than to receive justice. 
It is clear we cannot wait for com-
mittee leadership to recognize the im-
portance of this reform. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
at a time to be determined by the ma-
jority leader in consultation with the 
Republican leader, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours of debate equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to 
object, to my colleague from New 
York, I want to compliment you for 
the effort you brought to the table on 
trying to reform the military justice 
system, tackling areas of sexual as-
sault. I think we are making some real 
progress here. 
The one thing I don’t like is basically 
taking the commander out of the loop 
when it comes to military justice in a 
fashion that basically says we can’t 
trust our commanders to discipline 
their forces. A lot of the crimes that 
are being proposed here to be taken out 
of the military justice system have 
nothing to do with sexual assault. 
The theory is that our commanders 
are discriminatory, that there is racial 
bias in the system, and that we have a 
biased military justice system based on 
the color of your skin. Quite frankly, I 
don’t believe that, and I am never 
going to say that. That would be tak-
ing us down that road. 
What Senators INHOFE and REED have 
done, I think, makes a lot of sense. We 
have added to the list of crimes that 
would get special scrutiny—I think it 
is murder, kidnapping, and one other 
beyond the sexual assault crimes. 
When there is an allegation of sexual 
assault, there will be a new process 
that goes into whether or not the case 
goes to trial. One of the issues is, who 
should pick the jury? Well, the pros-
ecutor can’t pick the jury, the special 
prosecutor. You can’t have the pros-
ecutor picking the jury. The convening 
authority, the commander in charge of 
the units in question, will still be pick-
ing the jury, but the lawyers can strike 
members of the jury for cause and pre-
emptory challenges. At the end of the 
day, I think we made a lot of progress. 
Senator GILLIBRAND’s bill goes well 
beyond the stated purpose of what got 
us talking about this. I think it would 
destroy the military justice system as 
we know it and destroy the role of the 
commander. And, again, our com-
manders are the ones who decide who 
takes the most risks. Our commanders, 
again, have a lot of responsibility. 
They need to have the tools to make 
sure that unit is fit to fight. They will 
be under scrutiny, as they should be. 
But we want a military justice system 
that makes the military the most ef-
fective fighting force in the world, and 
you can’t have a strong military with-
out a strong command structure. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I just want to 
thank the Senator from South Carolina 
for his work and support in this area. 
He has worked with me in trying to 
find common ground, and I appreciate 
that work very much. I just want to re-
spond to a couple of his concerns. 
One of the reasons why we wanted to 
have a bright line at felonies is because 
we didn’t want to marginalize women 
in the armed services. If you only re-
move a small number of crimes—just 
the 11 that are in this bill—that dis-
proportionately affects women service-
members. 
Oftentimes, there will be a belief that 
these changes are made to give special 
treatment just to women servicemem-
bers. The reason why both Senator 
JONI
ERNST
and 
Senator 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH—two of the female armed 
service veterans in the U.S. Senate 
from both the Democratic and Repub-
lican Party—the reason they support 
this bill is because they believe that if 
you put the bright line at felonies and 
treat all servicemembers the same re-
gardless of the crime, that you won’t 
be further marginalizing women serv-
icemembers. They won’t be perceived 
as receiving special treatment. If they 
are being perceived as receiving special 
treatment, that is being perceived as a 
pink court, and we would like to avoid 
pink courts. We would like to avoid the 
perception of special treatment. 
We believe that if you are reforming 
the military justice system, as Sec-
retary Austin has said, that it needs to 
be unbiased, it needs to be professional-
ized, and it needs to be independent of 
the chain of command; that what is 
good for this set of crimes is good for 
all sets of crimes, just as the IRC has 
recommended. 
Second, we know that this type of 
system 
actually 
strengthens 
com-
manders because it allows them to 
focus on winning wars and training 
troops. This bifurcated system under 
the NDAA is going to leave com-
manders without all authority to do 
what they would want to do and just 
some authority, so there will be a lot 
of bureaucracy that will take time and 
effort and may lead to undue command 
influence 
and 
unintended 
con-
sequences. 
So a system that gives all that deci-
sionmaking directly to trained, inde-
pendent military prosecutors is pref-
erable and a commander-friendly sys-
tem. In fact, our allies chose to do a 
bright line at serious crimes for this 
very reason. UK, Israel, Australia, 
Netherlands, Canada, Germany—they 
did it specifically for both plaintiffs’ 
and defendants’ rights, so they had an 
equal justice system for all parties, and 
they allowed commanders to focus on 
commanding and doing the job of win-
ning wars and training troops. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a list of the roles that still remain with 
the commander, this larger list of what 
remains with the commander under 
this NDAA, as well as a list of the of-
fenses the NDAA takes out of the chain 
of command, which is 11, versus our 
bill, which would have been 38, as well 
as an analysis that this is a less com-
mander-friendly bill in current form. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

members accused of crimes the option of sep-
aration from service instead of facing a 
court-martial. 
Removing convening authority from com-
manders is critical to providing a system 
that is fair and perceived to be fair by sur-
vivors and the accused. Only one-third of 
survivors of sexual assault in the military 
are willing to come out of the shadows to re-
port their crime, showing a clear lack of 
trust in the system. 44% of survivors indi-
cated they would have been more likely to 
come forward if a prosecutor were in charge 
of the decision over whether to move forward 
with their case. With commanders retaining 
convening authority under the NDAA text, 
the Special Trial Counsel (‘‘STC’’) will still 
be necessarily reliant on the commander for 
the prosecution of a case. The perception and 
reality of commanders influencing the out-
come will be unavoidable. 
MJIIPA is the only provision that would 
empower impartial, independent prosecutors 
to make the vital decisions necessary for a 
criminal justice system shielded from sys-
temic command influence and other struc-
tural defects. It is the only system that uses 
the UCMJ as it is designed to implement 
military justice: empowering officers to exe-
cute convening authority. 
NDAA TEXT IS NOT COMMANDER FRIENDLY 
Under the Special Trial Counsel program 
alone, there is a lack of accountability for 
the system. Commanders remain in charge 
as the convening authority, but their hands 
are tied from making key decisions such as 
the referral of charges. The STC has some of 
the decision-making authorities, such as re-
ferral and the ability to make plea deals, but 
the commander is ultimately responsible for 
creating the court-martial, approving wit-
nesses, etc. Thus, there is not one figure who 
can be held accountable for the military jus-
tice process. Just as it would be unfair to 
send a commander into combat without all 
the tools at their disposal, it is unfair to 
commanders to keep them in charge of the 
court-martial but limit their decision-mak-
ing in this way. Under MJIIPA, commanders 
are allowed to focus on warfighting, train-
ing, and taking care of service members 
while independent military lawyers take 
over the military justice system for serious, 
non-military crimes. 
The STC program continues the risk of un-
lawful command influence. Every year, ap-
pellate courts throw out convictions for seri-
ous crimes because the commander oversteps 
their bounds. If commanders are still in 
charge under the STC program, but re-
stricted in new ways, this will only increase 
this risk. 
Under the STC program in the NDAA text, 
the commander will be unable to give non- 
judicial punishment (‘‘NJP’’) to the accused 
for lower-level conduct. If the STC decides 
not to prosecute, the commander will be un-
able to credibly impose NJP. For example, if 
the STC gets a stalking case and decides not 
to prosecute it, the commander may want to 
do non-judicial punishment, but if the ac-
cused refuses, the commander will be unable 
to send the case to court-martial. That takes 
the teeth out of the NJP. The accused walks 
away with no punishment. 
NDAA TEXT CREATES AN EVEN BIGGER JUDICIAL 
BUREAUCRACY
THAT
WILL
SLOW
DOWN
JUS-
TICE FOR SURVIVORS 
See Table B below. Some crimes will be 
prosecuted by Special Trial Counsels while 
the majority of the crimes will remain with-
in the chain of command. The bifurcated sys-
tem will create complexity and unfairness 
due to different processes for different 
crimes. 
Under the NDAA text, responsibilities will 
be divided between the commander, the Spe-
cial Trial Counsel, the Service Secretaries 
and the TJAGs (the head Judge Advocate of 
every Service), which will add layers of bu-
reaucracy, slowing the process down and 
making it take even longer for survivors to 
see justice. 
NDAA LANGUAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL SERI-
OUS NON-MILITARY CRIMES (INCLUDING SEX-
UAL
HARASSMENT
AND
CHILD 
ENDANGERMENT), CREATING
A
BIFURCATED, 
UNEQUAL
SYSTEM
FOR
SURVIVORS
AND
AC-
CUSED 
See Table B. The NDAA also fails to draw 
a bright line at all serious, non-military 
crimes. That bright line is critical, because 
it avoids creating so-called ‘‘pink courts’’ fo-
cused solely on sex crimes, which only fur-
ther stigmatizes survivors—something sur-
vivors have specifically asked us to avoid 
doing. Drawing that bright line also avoids 
creating an inherent inequality in the mili-
tary justice system. 
The crimes chosen for the STC program 
are seemingly random. Although sexual as-
sault and kidnapping are included, sexual 
harassment (which was in both the House 
and Senate versions of the NDAA), child 
endangerment, murder of a pregnant women, 
and obscene mailing are not (to name a few). 
How does a commander have more expertise 
on the prosecution of child endangerment 
than an independent military prosecutor? 
Every victim and every accused offender in 
these serious cases should be treated equally 
and have access to a system that is profes-
sional and unbiased. It is unrealistic and un-
tenable to leave these complex legal deci-
sions to commanders whose expertise relates 
to warfighting, not the minutiae of the law. 
OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE NDAA TEXT 
Implementing the requirement that the 
senior STC be an O–7 will take years because 
there are few generals or admirals with sig-
nificant litigation experience. There is a 
very limited number of military lawyers in 
the ranks of Admiral and General, and most, 
if not all, of them are generalists rather than 
military justice experts. It will take years 
for the services to develop the officers nec-
essary to fill this role. MJIIPA on the other 
hand allows O–6s to fill these roles. There are 
sufficient O–6s with military justice experi-
ence currently in the services. 
SENATOR GILLIBRAND IS CALLING FOR AN UP OR 
DOWN VOTE ON MJIIPA 
The process is broken: MJIIPA was in-
cluded in the Senate Armed Services NDAA 
bill and passed out of committee 23 to 3. It 
has 66 cosponsors in the Senate and 220 in 
the House. And yet without a vote or debate 
on the floor, this bipartisan, bicameral bill 
was gutted from the NDAA. 
MJIIPA and the new STC system can work 
well together, with MJIIPA acting as the 
overall structure and STCs prosecuting spe-
cial victim cases. 
A 
good 
overall 
explainer: 
https:// 
www.justsecurity.org/79481/ndaa-a-missed- 
opportunity/ 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3344 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
want to talk about the American Tax-
payer and Medicare Act, of which I am 
a sponsor. Cosponsoring this legisla-
tion with me are Senator GRAHAM, Sen-
ator HAGERTY, Senator TIM SCOTT, Sen-
ator RICK SCOTT, Senator BLACKBURN, 
Senator HAWLEY, Senator COTTON, Sen-
ator BOOZMAN, and others who are like-
ly to join. 
I am going to make a few remarks 
about the bill, and a number of my col-
leagues would also like to comment 
about my bill, so I will be yielding to 
them. At the end of my colleagues’ re-
marks, I will have a motion to make. 
As a result of the American Rescue 
Plan, working in conjunction with the 
Budget Control Act of 2011, there are 
cuts scheduled to take effect in 2022 
with respect to Medicare and with re-
spect to our farmers. 
Medicare specifically, unless my bill 
passes and unless this body takes ac-
tion, will be cut $36 billion. Those 
Medicare cuts will include—but they 
are not limited to—they will include 
cuts to cancer treatments for our el-
derly. Those cuts would reduce labora-
tory fees and analyses that our seniors 
depend on every single day. 
For the reasons I just referenced, our 
farmers are also going to get cut unless 
we take action—specifically, the crop 
insurance programs on which our farm-
ers rely. 
We are recovering from a pandemic, 
as we all know. Now is not the time, in 
my judgment, to put this burden on our 
seniors and on our farmers. Our sen-
iors, part of the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ 
don’t deserve them, and our farmers, 
the backbone of America, don’t deserve 
these cuts either. In fact, America was 
born on the farm, and I think we ought 
to keep that in mind. 
At this time, I would yield to the 
senior Senator from Arkansas, Senator 
BOOZMAN. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
want to thank Senator KENNEDY for his 
help and his leadership in this effort. 
We simply have to support America’s 
healthcare 
providers, 
farmers, 
and 
ranchers. Doctors and the entire med-
ical community are still struggling 
after being unable to perform non-
emergency procedures during the pan-
demic. 
With an aging population and more 
physicians not accepting Medicare be-
cause of insufficient payment, Medi-
care beneficiaries would face a reality 
of less access to quality care. That is 
why I introduced my own legislation to 
prevent these damaging cuts from 
harming our physicians, our providers. 
Our agriculture community is also 
struggling, and we must protect our 
farmers and ranchers by ensuring their 
operations can stay afloat and keep 
producing the most abundant 
and 
safest food supply in the world. 
For all of these reasons, I support 
Senator KENNEDY’s bill. 
I understand that my fellow Senator 
from Missouri also has some concerns, 
and so I yield to him. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
rise to make a very simple point, which 
is that Medicare is too important to be 
held hostage to political games, and 
that is what is going on here now. We 
need to have a clean bill to fully fund 
and protect Medicare for the millions 
of Americans who rely on it, including 
over 1 million just in the State of Mis-
souri. 
And that is why I am supporting Sen-
ator KENNEDY’s bill to fully protect and

secure Medicare, and I will support 
every amendment and bill and clean 
amendment and bill to fully protect 
and 
secure 
Medicare, 
including, 
I 
think, Senator GRAHAM’s that he’s 
going to be offering shortly, which I 
am also privileged to cosponsor. 
And I would just say this: I call on 
the Members of both parties—both par-
ties—to stop using Medicare as a pawn 
in a political game. Let’s fund Medi-
care. Let’s do it on its own. Let’s not 
hold it hostage to other agendas. Let’s 
not hold it hostage to other programs. 
Let’s not hold it hostage to others’ in-
dividual ambitions, whatever they may 
be. 
But let’s take the opportunity now 
with this bill to fully protect Medicare 
for our seniors all across this country. 
That should be something that we can 
all get behind, and for those reasons I 
am proud to support Senator KEN-
NEDY’s legislation. 
And now I yield to Senator HOEVEN. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank 
my colleague from Missouri. As my 
colleagues have pointed out, we rise to 
support Senator KENNEDY’s UC—unani-
mous consent request—his legislation, 
because we have consistently supported 
funding for Medicare and funding for 
our farmers and our ranchers who work 
hard to provide food, fuel, and fiber for 
our Nation. 
That is why I support both the UC re-
quest and the amendment that Senator 
GRAHAM is sponsoring. I am cospon-
soring that amendment as well. That 
would ensure that we fund these prior-
ities. 
I do not support linking these funds 
with an increase in the debt ceiling, as 
the bill from the House would do, with-
out our amendment. 
We should not be tying the debt ceil-
ing to important legislation that en-
sures healthcare providers can con-
tinue to care for our seniors and pro-
tect our farmers who produce the high-
est quality, lowest cost food supply in 
the world. 
So I strongly support and have co-
sponsored 
the 
Graham 
amendment 
which would strike the fast-track debt 
ceiling process from this bill. As we are 
saying very clearly, we support the 
funding for Medicare. We support the 
funding for our farmers and ranchers. 
Now, Democrats, who control the 
White House, the Senate, and the 
House, are trying to use reconciliation 
to pass a trillion-plus tax-and-spending 
bill on a purely partisan basis. Given 
that, they obviously can use reconcili-
ation to pass a debt ceiling increase on 
their own. They do not need this House 
legislation to do it. 
And with that, I will yield to my col-
league from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL: I thank the Senator 
for yielding. I am honored to be here 
this evening to support my colleague 
from Louisiana. I want to take this Na-
tion back to a year ago, a year ago this 
spring in April 2020. COVID was on the 
rise—our first variant, our first wave 
ripping through this country. Our ERs 
were overflowing; the ICU beds were 
full; and doctors and nurses across this 
Nation ran to the sound of the battle. 
We 
didn’t 
have 
vaccines. 
There 
weren’t therapeutics, but we took an 
oath to take care of our fellow man. I 
joined those doctors. I went to an ICU 
in Southwest Kansas where we had 8 
beds, 12 patients, and 9 ventilators. 
So how are we going to reward those 
doctors today? We are going to cut 
their pay. We are going to cut most 
doctors’ pay 2 to 11 percent. Even be-
fore COVID, there was a doctor short-
age. There was doctor burnout. Be-
cause of this pay cut, even more doc-
tors will quit. More doctors are going 
to stop taking Medicare. 
Yesterday, the leadership on the 
other side of the aisle just wanted to 
kick doctors, but today I found out 
they are kicking farmers in the shins 
as well. Holding doctors and farmers 
hostage is no way to run a government. 
I, too, am tired of seeing doctors and 
farmers used as pawns for political 
gain. 
I support Senator KENNEDY’s bill, and 
I am honored to turn it back to him. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
Americans may be poor since President 
Biden took office, but they are not stu-
pid. 
They look around Washington, DC, 
and they see liars and they see frauds 
in every direction. Now, I don’t think a 
single member of this body supports 
cutting Medicare or hurting our farm-
ers, especially not at this moment. I 
don’t. I don’t. 
And I don’t think any of my Repub-
lican colleagues or any of my Demo-
cratic colleagues do as well. But a deal 
has been made. A deal has been made 
to give us—some of us see it this way 
anyway—a choice between voting for a 
heart attack or cancer. 
You either have to give up your prin-
ciples on the debt limit or you have to 
vote to cut Medicare and hurt our 
farmers, and no one wants to do that. I 
understand that people disagree over 
the debt limit, but there is no disagree-
ment in this body over not cutting 
Medicare and not hurting our farmers. 
Now, I am labor. I am not part of 
management. I don’t want to be part of 
management. I wouldn’t be good at 
management because I don’t always fit 
in. It is not one of my best qualities. In 
fact, it is my best quality, and that is 
why I brought this bill. 
As Senator HAWLEY said, much more 
eloquently than I could, the disagree-
ment that reasonable people are having 
over the debt limit has been conflated 
in a cynical attempt to fool the Amer-
ican people by putting them both in a 
bill that we are going to shortly be 
asked to vote on. And we are going to 
be asked to give the American people 
either a heart attack or cancer. You 
have to choose. And I don’t want to 
make that choice, and I am not going 
to make that choice. And that is why I 
brought this bill. 
I do not agree with my Democratic 
friends about the debt limit. I don’t 
support Build Back Better. I under-
stand many of my Democratic friends 
do. I understand President Biden does. 
I understand Senator SCHUMER does. I 
understand Speaker PELOSI does. And I 
respect that, but I don’t support it. 
Now, they are going to try to pass 
Build Back Better, and they are going 
to try to implement it. But they can’t 
do it without raising the debt ceiling. 
Now, if I don’t support the Build Back 
Better bill, why would I want to allow 
them to borrow the money to imple-
ment the Build Back Better bill? I 
don’t, and I am not going to break my 
word and vote to do that. 
If my colleagues want to do that, 
that is their business. I don’t tell peo-
ple how to vote. If I am ever asked how 
to vote, I rarely—I almost always say, 
follow your heart, but just take your 
brain with you. And that is why I 
brought this bill. And I want to make 
it very clear, and you can write this 
down and take it home to mama, I do 
not support cutting Medicare, and I do 
not support cutting farmers. 
I do support keeping my word to the 
American people. When I tell them I 
am going to do something, by God, I 
am going to stick. And I am not going 
to be scared away by some cynical deal 
that was made in Washington, DC. 
Now, Madam President, as in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S. 3344—the bill 
about which I have been speaking, and 
my colleagues, Protecting the Amer-
ican Taxpayer and Medicare Act—at 
this time, it is at the desk. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President and 
colleagues, I yield to no Senator in my 
support of this country’s senior citi-
zens. My background, colleagues, I was 
codirector of the Oregon Gray Pan-
thers, the senior citizens group, for al-
most 7 years before I went into public 
life. 
And I know that there is no Senator 
here who doesn’t support senior citi-
zens, farmers, the extraordinarily im-
portant Americans that my colleagues 
have been talking about. 
But what really has not been ex-
plained here—because we all kind of 
talk this special lingo around here—is 
what my colleagues really seek to do in 
the Kennedy amendment. 
What my colleague from Louisiana 
wishes to do is rip up an agreement 
reached between Democrats and Repub-
licans. Specifically, colleagues, Sen-
ators Schumer and McConnell. So what 
they did is reach a bipartisan agree-
ment to defuse an economic timebomb 
by creating a process to avoid default. 
Senator KENNEDY’s proposal sticks a 
flame right back under that fuse. Now,

December 8, 2021 
the two parties obviously have dif-
ferent approaches when it comes to 
gamesmanship around this country’s 
financial commitments. Setting all of 
that aside, the fact is our country is 
now way too close to default for the 
Senate to be playing games. 
This debate is almost entirely about 
financial commitments made under 
past Presidents. It doesn’t have any-
thing to do with legislation that is still 
in the works. That is a fact. The re-
ality is my colleague from Louisiana 
seeks to bring the country closer to de-
fault. The Senate ought to be clear on 
the consequences if that were to come 
to pass. 
Default would be an economic dis-
aster for our country as well as for in-
dividual families and businesses. And, 
again, colleagues, since senior citizens 
came up so frequently, this has been 
my particular passion. It is why I went 
into public service. Social Security 
stops going out. Military could stop 
getting paid. Interest rates go into the 
stratosphere, making existing Federal 
debt even more expensive, if you go for-
ward with this proposal. 
Costs go up for families who want to 
buy homes or buy cars. Getting a small 
business loan becomes more expensive. 
Jobs across the country are wiped out 
amid this turmoil. And all of that 
would happen right in the middle of the 
holidays, when Americans are simply 
trying to enjoy their time with fami-
lies, go out and shop for presents, and 
enjoy their time together. 
My view is, after almost 2 years of 
pandemic and economic chaos, people 
have had it hard enough. And two lead-
ers—a Democrat and a Republican— 
have come together because they un-
derstand the Senate doesn’t need to 
add another catastrophe to their finan-
cial challenges, the challenges I just 
described—one, by the way, that would 
be entirely self-made. 
There is an agreement before the 
Senate, colleagues; an agreement be-
tween the Republican leader and the 
Democratic leader. That agreement 
brought the two sides together. My col-
leagues must not throw that agree-
ment away. And I respect all my col-
leagues—all of them—but I just believe 
that this proposal from the Senator 
from Louisiana is misguided. It brings 
our country closer to default. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
really appreciate my colleague’s re-
marks, I do. I don’t agree with his ob-
jection, but I appreciate it. 
I just want to say a couple more 
words. I didn’t make a deal. Now, let 
me say it again. Let me say it a dif-
ferent way. 
I don’t hate anybody. Lord knows I 
look for grace wherever I can find it. I 
like every one of my colleagues; I real-
ly do. The Senate is the most inter-
esting group of people I have ever been 
around. 
I am not part of management. I am 
labor, and I meant what I said. I belong 
in labor because I don’t always fit in, 
and I do believe it is one of my best 
qualities. 
The truth of the matter is—and this 
is what we are disagreeing over—Presi-
dent Biden, Senator SCHUMER, Speaker 
PELOSI, my other Democratic friends 
have proposed the Build Back Better 
bill. 
Now, any economist with a pulse will 
tell you that it is going to cost about 
$5 trillion without the gimmicks. It is 
going to raise taxes a couple of trillion. 
We will probably end up having to bor-
row another 3 trillion to pay for it. We 
will have to borrow the money. We 
don’t have the 3 trillion. We don’t even 
have 5 percent of it. 
Now, I think that the bill represents 
a spending taxation and borrowing 
orgy that we don’t need, but I under-
stand my Democratic colleagues dis-
agree. I get that. 
My Democratic friends can’t pass and 
implement the bill without raising the 
debt limit. That is just a fact, because 
they won’t be able to borrow the 
money. 
Now, if I don’t support the bill, why 
do I want to support allowing them to 
borrow the money, especially when 
Senator SCHUMER—my friend Senator 
SCHUMER—can do it on his own? 
He can do it before the weekend is 
out. All he has got to do is do a simple 
amendment to the budget resolution. 
What am I missing here? 
And I know a deal has been made and 
some people are going to vote for it. 
You are not looking at one of them. 
And I respect their right to make a 
deal, but I didn’t make a deal. But I 
have been put in the position of saying: 
OK, Kennedy, we are going to show 
you. You have got to choose between 
keeping your word to your people or 
cutting Medicare. 
And we wonder why Congress polls 
right up there with skim milk. That is 
why they look around, they see frauds 
and liars in every direction. 
I really regret that my bill didn’t 
pass because it would have protected 
our elderly, and I do support protecting 
our elderly. And it would have pro-
tected our farmers, and I do support 
protecting our farmers. And this so- 
called deal puts them both at risk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I 
have a different approach that will get 
the same result. 
But to my colleagues here, we are 
playing the Medicare card in a very 
dangerous fashion. Senator HAWLEY 
said it pretty well. Medicare is some-
thing people depend upon, and all of us 
understand the need to keep Medicare 
solvent. We need to reform it to save 
it. 
But this idea puts all of us in a box, 
and I don’t appreciate it and I won’t 
forget it. 
Now, this is a problem on our side. 
You don’t even have to listen, Senator 
WYDEN. For 4 months, we have been 
saying, as a party, our Democratic col-
leagues are spending all this money by 
themselves 
through 
reconciliation; 
they should choose that path to raise 
the debt ceiling. 
Because what are we talking about? 
A $1.9 trillion spending bill without one 
Republican 
vote 
through 
reconcili-
ation. 
We have pending next week another 
reconciliation proposal that scores at 
1.7 trillion, if you assume every pro-
gram goes away in a year. I will be in 
the NBA before that assumption. I 
don’t like my chances. 
Ronald Reagan said the closest thing 
to immortality on Earth is a govern-
ment program. 
So they have written the bill for the 
17 big spending items to expire within 
1, 2 or 3 years, and not one of them 
want them to expire. 
So the whole bill is a fraud. And the 
Congressional Budget Office is going to 
give to me Friday what the bill would 
cost if the sunset clauses actually went 
away—did go away; what would it cost 
if the programs survive, which it will. 
And I anticipate, Senator KENNEDY, 
it will be at least twice what we are 
talking about. 
The effect on the debt is 367 billion 
only because they limited the pro-
grams to last for a year or two rather 
than the 10 years they are actually 
going to last. 
So the deficit is going to go from 367 
billion to probably close to 2 trillion. 
We are going to expose that Friday. 
They are playing a game. They are cre-
ating gimmicks. 
And Senator MANCHIN, to his credit, 
said: ‘‘I believe Build Back Better is 
full of gimmicks.’’ 
We will know Friday exactly what 
the bill would look like without gim-
micks. 
This is the ultimate gimmick. If you 
had asked me 4 months ago, ‘‘How does 
this movie end?’’ I will be reading in 
the paper about a rules change to the 
Senate made by the House, where I 
have got to pick between Medicare and 
abandoning what I said I would do for 
4 months. 
This is a deal that led to Donald 
Trump. If you wonder why there is a 
Donald Trump, it is moments like this, 
where everybody starts down a road 
that makes perfect sense, you panic, 
and you throw everybody over. 
They would raise the debt ceiling 
through reconciliation because they 
should, and we want to do it that way 
to deter spending in the future. We 
want to make it harder to use rec-
onciliation to spend more money than 
World War II cost. 
If you look at the cost of World War 
II in present dollars, it was 4.7 trillion. 
When you look at all the money we 
spent and going to spend, it is going to 
be 5.4 trillion. Literally, we have spent 
more money in the last year and a half 
than we did to win World War II. 
I think they should raise the debt 
ceiling, Senator KENNEDY, through the

process they used to spend the money. 
That made perfect sense to me as a Re-
publican. That is why I said it for 4 
months. 
Now, all of us on our side have a mo-
ment of reckoning here. I don’t want to 
default, and we won’t. But I do want to 
make sure that when Republicans tell 
their other Republicans and the public 
at large, you can somewhat count on 
who we are and what we say. We put 
that at risk for no good reason. 
To the leadership of both sides, I like 
you. Senator MCCONNELL has been a 
great 
Republican 
leader—minority 
leader, majority leader. But this is a 
moment where I want to be on the 
RECORD to say, I don’t like this. 
What we have done is allow the 
House of Representatives to change a 
Senate rule. No matter what the sub-
ject matter, that is not a good idea. We 
have set in place a process that allows 
our Democratic colleagues to raise the 
debt ceiling without using reconcili-
ation, the budget process, where they 
would have to amend the budget reso-
lution. The very resolution they used 
to spend all this money, we are simply 
asking amend it to pay for it. 
We have taken that off the table, and 
people on our side are not going to ac-
cept this very well. So all I can say is— 
I want to make it clear—when it comes 
to Medicare, count me in to avoid the 
cuts. When it comes to raising the debt 
ceiling, I want it done through a proc-
ess that will make it harder to spend 
all this money in the future. And I 
want to be part of a Republican Party 
that you can take what we say to the 
bank on big stuff—stuff that matters. 
So I have a proposal that when the 
bill comes over from the House, which 
it is here, that would allow us to vote 
to prevent Medicare from being cut, 
would strip out the way you are going 
to raise the debt ceiling, reject the idea 
that the House can amend a Senate 
rule to limit minority rights—and that 
is what we have done here. 
This is not a good idea, to take Medi-
care and marry it up with anything im-
portant, as Senator HAWLEY said, be-
cause there is no end to that game. 
And it is not a good idea, in my view, 
even with some Members of my own 
party agreeing, to let the House change 
the Senate rules. I don’t like that. We 
have set in motion some really dan-
gerous stuff here, so I have the fol-
lowing proposal: 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the Sen-
ate resumes consideration of House 
message to accompany S. 610, it be in 
order for me to offer amendment No. 
4877, which strikes section 8 relating to 
the debt limit. I further ask that the 
Senate vote on adoption of the amend-
ment prior to the vote on the motion 
to invoke cloture on the motion to con-
cur in the amendment to S. 610. 
In English, I am asking for a vote so 
that we can show the country that we 
will protect Medicare, but many of us 
are not going to have our fingerprints 
on a Washington deal that I think 
stinks up the place. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator form Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, now, 
my colleague from South Carolina 
began his remarks with two of my very 
favorite subjects: supporting America’s 
senior citizens and playing in the NBA, 
a lifetime dream of mine. 
But the fact is, this unanimous con-
sent request from my colleague is es-
sentially a different way to do the 
same thing as the Kennedy request. 
And, colleagues, it is wrong for exactly 
the same reason. 
The prospect of default is not simply 
a matter of the two sides squaring off 
over who has got the best talking 
points. The fact is, default would just 
be an economic disaster. 
I just laid out what it would mean for 
our small businesses and our folks who 
depend on keeping interest rates from 
shooting into the stratosphere, and the 
military would have difficulty getting 
paid. That is not what America wants. 
Colleagues, I was just home this 
weekend. I got around my State, and 
what people said overwhelmingly is— 
they said: ‘‘Hey, I heard you guys just 
got together’’—I say to my friend from 
South Carolina—‘‘and you guys got an 
agreement on keeping the government 
open. Heard that wasn’t going to hap-
pen.’’ 
And then they said: ‘‘Ron, what you 
have always tried to do since those 
Gray Panther days’’—and my colleague 
from South Carolina knows I always 
try to be bipartisan. 
They said: ‘‘Keep it going. Keep going 
with that bipartisan effort.’’ 
Now, they are listening to a debate 
about my colleagues trying to bust up 
an agreement between the Democratic 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, and the Re-
publican leader, MITCH MCCONNELL, to 
make sure we pay the bills for costs 
that have been incurred. 
So my colleague from South Carolina 
has asked for consent, and I think it 
would be a mistake for this country 
and be a mistake particularly for our 
country’s senior citizens that I have 
devoted so much time to. For that rea-
son, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. So why does this mat-
ter? It matters a lot about how the 
Senate works. Every Member of this 
body has the ability to come down to 
the floor and object to a piece of legis-
lation. That makes the Senate dif-
ferent than the House. 
What we have done here is allowed 
the House to change the Senate rules 
in a fashion where, if you can get 10 
Republicans, all of us are dealt out. So 
that is not a good idea 1 time, 10 times, 
or 100 times by either party because 
what it does, it changes the rules of the 
Senate in a fashion that I feel very un-
comfortable with simply because the 
House has been able to change the 
rules of the Senate so that all of us 
have been basically marginalized. 
There will be some Republicans who 
are my friends, and do what you need 
to do. I understand. I don’t want to de-
fault on the debt either. But this is a 
bad idea. It is not what we promised we 
would do. It sets in motion playing the 
Medicare card in a dangerous fashion, 
and it sure as hell sets in motion play-
ing with the rules of the Senate in a 
fashion that I never even thought of 
until 24 hours ago. 
So I want to make this hard, not 
easy, because I think what we are 
doing is going to really change the 
structure of the Senate and certainly 
going to do a lot of damage to the Re-
publican Party. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Tennessee. 
VACCINE MANDATE 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, on 
September 
9, 
President 
Biden 
an-
nounced that his Department of Labor, 
through OSHA, would issue a vaccine 
mandate covering more than 80 million 
privately employed Americans. Viola-
tors would be subject to significant fi-
nancial penalties. 
This mandate makes medical deci-
sions for much of the American people 
with the stroke of a pen, and it imme-
diately struck me as severe Federal 
overreach. Therefore, the next day, I 
wrote to the Secretary of Labor to con-
firm that he would submit this man-
date to Congress for review under the 
Congressional Review Act. In that let-
ter, I noted that Americans’ elected 
representatives should review an order 
that threatens the livelihoods of many 
of their constituents. 
I am pleased to join Senator BRAUN 
and a majority of my Senate colleagues 
in supporting this resolution to dis-
approve 
President 
Biden’s 
vaccine 
mandate. 
Regarding the mandate itself, I want 
to first say that I support the vaccine, 
which 
is 
a 
product 
of 
President 
Trump’s Operation Warp Speed. I vis-
ited my doctor, and I made the per-
sonal choice to take the vaccine. I have 
spoken to many Tennesseans and have 
urged them to do the same. But the de-
cision to take the vaccine is a personal 
one. It is a decision that each Amer-
ican should be allowed to make in con-
sultation with his or her doctor, not 
under Federal threat of job loss and fi-
nancial penalty. This mandate improp-
erly puts the Federal Government be-
tween Americans and their doctors and 
between Americans and their jobs. 
Tens of millions of essential workers 
were asked to risk their health for the 
good of the country during the pan-
demic. They courageously responded to 
this call. Many of them—many of 
them—contracted the virus. Yet now 
we are telling these heroes, from front-
line healthcare workers to the employ-
ees who made sure we had access to 
groceries and essential goods, that 
they will be fired unless they comply

with the vaccine mandate. They de-
serve better. 
Not only is this vaccine mandate 
wrong, but it was promptly declared 
unlawful by the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
Other Biden administration vaccine 
mandates are meeting similar fates in 
the courts. Yet the Biden administra-
tion refuses to relent or reevaluate the 
damage that it is doing. 
Sadly, the Biden administration’s use 
of Federal Government power to con-
trol the American people’s lives is not 
limited to vaccine mandates; it is a 
basic element of their strategy to re-
make America. Don’t believe me? Just 
look at the Democrats’ so-called Build 
Back Better proposal. The Biden ad-
ministration is marketing this legisla-
tion to transform America by using a 
cartoon depicting a mom and her son 
and the government programs on which 
they would depend under this plan 
from the very beginning of their lives 
to the very end. That is the definition 
of cradle-to-grave, Big Government de-
pendency, and that is the stated goal of 
the Democrats’ legislation. 
This legislation federalizes preschool 
and childcare, which will crowd out 
community- and faith-based providers 
and put the Federal Government in 
charge of what your children are 
taught during their most formative 
years. 
If this was about children, then par-
ents would be allowed to choose the 
preschool or childcare provider that is 
best for their children, but, instead, it 
is about control. So the government 
would 
ultimately 
decide 
which 
preschools and which childcare pro-
viders would survive. 
The Build Back Better legislation in-
creases by 10 times the penalties on 
private employers for violating the 
vaccine mandate. Now, a willful viola-
tion can result in a $700,000 fine and 
must result in a minimum fine of 
$50,000. In other words, small busi-
nesses that fail to comply will face fi-
nancial ruin. 
When it comes to employment, if you 
are one of the millions of Americans 
who work in the oil and gas industry, 
the Build Back Better plan delivers 
$550 billion worth of crushing Green 
New Deal mandates and tax increases. 
It replaces these good-paying jobs with 
$8 billion to the Civilian Climate 
Corps, a taxpayer-funded climate po-
lice. 
Once your job is gone or your busi-
ness is closed, the Build Back Better 
proposal offers government welfare 
programs with no work requirements. 
This attacks the dignity of work and 
right of self-determination that under-
scores what it means to be American— 
again, more government control. 
By providing $80 billion in increased 
IRS funding—a staggering six times 
the current IRS budget—the Biden ad-
ministration is planning to wring an 
extra $400 billion out of the American 
people to pay for all of this Big Govern-
ment. With everyone from small busi-
ness owners to grandparents now fac-
ing regular audits and IRS spying on 
their bank accounts, the government 
will have much greater control over 
how Americans earn and how they 
spend their money. 
In sharp contrast, Republicans want 
to put Americans, not the Federal Gov-
ernment, in control of their lives. We 
want 
to 
strengthen 
the 
American 
dream so that Americans can free 
themselves from government depend-
ency. We oppose Big Government so-
cialism that imposes greater Federal 
control over Americans’ lives. 
In the coming weeks, Members of 
this body will be asked a very simple 
question, whether on the vaccine man-
date or the Build Back Better legisla-
tion: Do you believe the Federal Gov-
ernment should have more control over 
American lives? Their answers are cru-
cial for the future of our country. Is 
cradle-to-grave 
government 
depend-
ency something to help Americans 
avoid or is it something to strive for? 
Should personal healthcare decisions 
be made by Americans or by govern-
ment agencies? Do parents know what 
is best for their children or should bu-
reaucrats and teachers unions decide? 
Are you willing to eliminate good-pay-
ing energy jobs? Should the IRS have 
more power to spy on the American 
people? 
Over the next weeks, all of us must 
decide what kind of country we will 
have. My hope is that we will preserve 
and strengthen the American dream by 
empowering Americans to determine 
their own futures, to climb the ladder 
of success, and to free themselves from 
government 
dependency—not 
treat 
them with a lack of dignity that sug-
gests that the very best they can hope 
for is a life managed by the Federal 
Government. 
The first opportunity to provide an 
answer is the upcoming vote on this 
resolution 
disapproving 
President 
Biden’s vaccine mandate. I have been 
pleased to work with Senator BRAUN to 
bring this resolution to the floor, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support its 
adoption. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Congress, 
not the Executive, makes the laws in 
this country. National laws have to be 
passed by the legislative branch. Our 
Constitution makes that very clear. In 
fact, it is the very clause of the first 
section of the first article of the Con-
stitution. It states unambiguously: 
All legislative Powers herein granted shall 
be vested in a Congress of the United States, 
which shall consist of a Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
You cannot make up Federal law 
without going through that formula— 
passage in the House, passage in the 
Senate, followed by presentment to the 
President. 
In the case of COVID–19 vaccine re-
quirements, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United States has decreed mandates— 
mandates that threaten the jobs and 
the livelihoods of 45 million Ameri-
cans, including over half a million 
Utahns whose jobs are on the line. 
Now, courts across the country have 
started—quite correctly—to recognize 
that these mandates are offensive to 
the Constitution. They are not author-
ized by the law. But that doesn’t di-
minish in any way, shape, or form our 
duty here as Members of the U.S. Sen-
ate, as part of the legislative branch, 
to assert clearly, unambiguously, and 
swiftly that these mandates are uncon-
stitutional, illegal, and morally inde-
fensible. 
I have heard from hundreds of Utahns 
who are themselves at risk of losing 
their jobs and therefore their ability to 
provide food for their children, specifi-
cally due to these mandates. Their sto-
ries 
are 
nothing 
short 
of 
heart-
breaking. I have heard from countless 
businesses in my State, businesses that 
are afraid of losing key workers and 
having to shut their doors and no 
longer operate specifically due to these 
mandates. I have heard from people 
who happen to have medical or reli-
gious concerns over the vaccines, and 
their pleas are falling on deaf ears. 
These Americans aren’t asking for 
anything extravagant or unusual or un-
reasonable—far from it. These are 
Americans who are simply worried 
about their ability to put food on the 
table and gifts under the tree during 
challenging economic times—economic 
times that are difficult enough as it 
now stands, economic times that have 
been worsened by excessive govern-
ment spending, economic times that 
are about to get a whole lot more dif-
ficult for a whole lot more people spe-
cifically because of these mandates. 
President Biden seeks to make them 
not only unemployed but also unem-
ployable, second-class pariahs. 
Well, it is true the courts have of-
fered temporary relief to some, but 
these Americans and these businesses 
look to Congress for immediate, last-
ing, and permanent relief. We do, after 
all, make the law. We are the only 
branch of the Federal Government au-
thorized to do so. 
So this will be one of the easiest 
votes that I have ever cast in my 11 
years in the Senate. The American peo-
ple agree. Only 14 percent of those 
polled support firing those who are 
unvaccinated. Fourteen percent of all 
Americans say that, yeah, somebody 
who doesn’t get the vaccine ought to be 
fired as a result of not getting the vac-
cine. Even some Democratic politicians 
are starting to change their tune. They 
are souring on the mandates. 
Americans understand that condi-
tioning employment on personal med-
ical decisions is callous, it is cruel, and 
it is immoral. It is certainly not some-
thing that these people want to face. It 
is not something that Democrats or 
Republicans want. It is not something 
they agree with. It is not something 
they are going to tolerate. 
The economic impact of firing half a 
million Utahns would be disastrous,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9030 
December 8, 2021 
and when you replicate the effects of 
doing that on State after State, where 
we see—according to many datasets, 
anywhere from a quarter to a third of 
the workforce in most States is being 
threatened by this. In some States, it 
is higher. It is more like 40 percent in 
places like West Virginia, 37 percent in 
Alabama, and 31 percent in Utah. 
Now, in the healthcare sector alone, 
where keeping doctors and nurses and 
technicians at work has been particu-
larly difficult, the Nation risks losing 
countless thousands of key profes-
sionals while the need for their very 
services remains most dire. 
This isn’t acceptable. It is not some-
thing we want to see. It is not some-
thing we should have to face. 
When you add all of this up, the cu-
mulative effect across different indus-
tries and in different States across the 
Nation would be catastrophic as we 
face supply chain troubles, inflation, 
rising gas prices, a labor shortage, and 
so, so much more. The very last thing 
our economy needs is to have tens of 
millions of Americans unemployed. 
I am very, very much against these 
mandates. I am for the vaccines. I have 
been vaccinated. My family has been 
vaccinated; and I have encouraged peo-
ple everywhere to get vaccinated, but 
when someone chooses not to be vac-
cinated for whatever reason—whether 
it is a medical reason or a religious 
reason or a reason related to a personal 
belief or due to a specific concern 
about a specific reaction they have had 
to something else—it is still their deci-
sion. It still doesn’t warrant the over-
powering hand of the Federal Govern-
ment’s coming in and threatening to 
force their employers to fire them 
under the threat of crippling pen-
alties—penalties that any employer, no 
matter how big or wealthy or other-
wise lucrative, would find incapaci-
tating. 
I have come to the Senate floor now 
20 times to speak specifically against 
President Biden’s vaccine mandates. I 
have offered more than a dozen bills to 
reduce their harms on millions of 
Americans and hundreds of thousands 
of Utahns. 
Today, with my colleagues, I encour-
age the Senate to use the Congres-
sional Review Act as it was intended. 
There is no clearer example in the his-
tory of the Congressional Review Act 
of such an egregious overstep by the 
Executive. There is no more blatant 
abuse of delegated authority or usurpa-
tion of authority that was never grant-
ed. The Congressional Review Act pro-
vides us with the opportunity to strike 
down this offensive mandate and make 
sure that neither President Biden nor 
any subsequent President can institute 
a similar rule. 
I encourage my colleagues to think 
of the half a million Utahns, of the al-
most 5 million Californians, of the 
300,000 West Virginians, and of the tens 
of millions elsewhere across the Na-
tion. Forty-five million livelihoods are 
at stake of the workers and families in 
each of our States. These Americans 
demand that we take action. Today, we 
have that choice. I implore each and 
every one of my colleagues to stand 
with the American people, the Amer-
ican worker, the American family by 
supporting this resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
this 
evening 
to 
discuss 
President 
Biden’s 
divisive 
and 
unprecedented 
vaccine mandate on private businesses. 
I would like to make one thing clear 
at the start: I have encouraged Nebras-
kans to consider getting vaccinated 
since the day these vaccines were ap-
proved, and I hope more Americans will 
join me in choosing to get one, but 
that is their choice. 
Through OSHA, the administration 
has issued an ‘‘emergency rule’’ to re-
quire, roughly, 84 million employees of 
private companies to get vaccinated or 
be subjected to weekly testing. If busi-
ness owners fail to enforce this rule for 
their employees, they could be fined 
tens of thousands of dollars per viola-
tion. 
The Biden administration is on en-
tirely new ground here. There is simply 
no precedent for this kind of intrusion 
into Americans’ private lives. Courts 
agree. The Fifth Circuit blocked the 
OSHA mandate almost immediately, 
citing ‘‘grave statutory and constitu-
tional issues.’’ 
We in Congress have the power to 
push back too. In October, I joined nine 
of my Senate colleagues in sending a 
letter to President Biden that outlined 
our concerns about this abuse of Fed-
eral power. Under the Congressional 
Review Act, the House and Senate can 
vote to overturn executive Agency ac-
tions like this OSHA mandate, and I 
hope the Senate will do that when we 
vote on this later today. All 50 Senate 
Republicans signed on to this chal-
lenge. If our resolution passes both 
Chambers—and it looks like it may do 
that on a bipartisan basis—President 
Biden will have to decide if he wants to 
keep defending this deeply unpopular 
policy. 
The 
administration’s 
decision 
to 
force private employees to get vac-
cinated is not just unprecedented; it is 
also counterproductive. It would apply 
to nearly 300,000 workers in my State 
of Nebraska alone—more than 28 per-
cent of our entire workforce. Busi-
nesses across Nebraska, from grocery 
chains to irrigation companies and 
family farms, have reached out to me 
about the damage this mandate will do 
to their companies. They come from 
very different industries, but their 
message is the same: We support the 
vaccines, and we have taken this pan-
demic seriously, but if the President 
goes through with this mandate, we 
could lose many of our employees. 
At a time when millions of jobs need 
to be filled and we are seeing massive 
supply chain issues, Americans simply 
cannot afford this kind of Federal over-
reach. We need to stop this mandate in 
its tracks here in Congress because this 
could be the first step on the road to 
even stricter rules. 
Let’s just look at New York City. It 
has recently announced one vaccine re-
quirement that will affect private em-
ployees and another that will affect 
children as young as 5 years old. Bill de 
Blasio’s parting gift to New Yorkers is 
this: Get at least one shot by December 
27, or you are going to lose your job. 
Starting later this month, kinder-
gartners are going to have to show vac-
cine cards to get into restaurants, 
movie 
theaters, 
and 
other 
public 
places. 
I do not want to see policies like this 
even come close to being enacted at 
the Federal level, but I wouldn’t put it 
past this President to try. The Senate 
must pass this resolution and prevent 
these kinds of mandates from being 
issued again in the future. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I come 
here this evening, but I have been back 
home on recess breaks ever since there 
has been this idea of a vaccine man-
date. 
We have got a modern miracle in 
having vaccines available like they 
have been. It is part of the long jour-
ney against COVID. Along with thera-
peutics now, they are miracles. Yet 
getting vaccinated should be a decision 
between an individual and his or her 
doctor. It shouldn’t be up to any politi-
cian, especially in a mandate coming 
down from that highest authority—our 
President—and he ought to be con-
sistent with what he has said in the 
past. He said he would never make vac-
cines mandatory. He didn’t keep his 
word. 
Overreach—I have been here a little 
under 3 years, and I see it in so many 
arenas, a lot of it with good intention. 
We try to solve things here. I think the 
American public sometimes scratches 
its collective heads to say: Where are 
the results? Why does it cost so much? 
But in this case, you have got to also 
take into consideration our Constitu-
tion, our personal freedoms. It is at 
stake today. 
The Federal Government has no au-
thority to make anyone choose be-
tween getting a vaccine and keeping 
their job. Today, this body will stand 
up against this overreach. 
Main Street—Main Street—is where I 
come from. When you have to explain 
to people constantly when they are 
scared by actions like this, can this 
possibly happen; will the government 
go through with it; will it somehow fall 
apart—well, when you have bad ideas, 
that eventually happens. And it is 
going to start here this evening. We 
have seen it in the courts. It has been 
repeated earlier here this evening how 
unpopular it is with the American pub-
lic. 
We did everything we could to keep 
individuals with their employers. We 
have spent billions, trillions of dollars 
doing so. The threshold for a small

business then, when we were helping, 
was 500 employees. Now we have low-
ered it to 100. It has got people fright-
ened across the country. 
Small businesses face enough hard-
ships. Most are finally getting some 
type of equilibrium with everything 
that has happened over the last year 
and a half, and now they have to con-
tend with this. 
As mentioned earlier, any businesses 
could get fined up to $14,000 per em-
ployee. That is more than we were 
lending them—money—in some small 
businesses over the recent past. 
A lot of stuff just does not make 
sense. Listen to the number of organi-
zations, ones that all play into telling 
us how they like to keep free enter-
prise going, keeping the private sector 
healthy: the National Federation of 
Independent Business, NFIB; National 
Retail 
Federation; 
National 
Res-
taurant Association; Association of 
Wholesale 
Distributors; 
American 
Trucking 
Associations; 
Associated 
Builders and Contractors; Associated 
General Contractors; American Pipe-
line Contractors; National Lumber and 
Building Material Dealers; Distribu-
tion Contractors. These are all busi-
nesses—I have another 10 I could men-
tion—that come from Main Street 
America. It is not the tier of largest 
corporations; these are the businesses 
in our own hometowns. They are cry-
ing out: Do not follow through with 
this lunacy. 
When you dig a hole, and you keep 
making it deeper, despite everything 
you are hearing, that is a bad business 
plan. You can always get out of it by 
just quit digging. And you are hearing 
it loud and clear. 
We must focus on returning to the 
prosperity we achieved pre-COVID. One 
thing that will stop this recovery cold 
is the Federal Government getting in 
the way, as it is doing now. 
His mandates are under fire in the 
courts. Main Street job creators are 
complaining against it. And tonight, 
the U.S. Senate must send a clear mes-
sage: Back off on this bad idea. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to join my Re-
publican colleagues to oppose Presi-
dent Biden’s vaccine mandates. 
Last December, President-elect Joe 
Biden told the American people that he 
would not issue a vaccine mandate. 
Just a year ago, as President-elect, Joe 
Biden said: 
I don’t think they should be mandatory. 
He said: 
I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory. 
Last October, as a Presidential can-
didate, Joe Biden said: 
You can’t say ‘‘Everyone has to do [it].’’ 
Then, this summer, his Press Sec-
retary said it is ‘‘not a role the federal 
government even has the power to 
make’’—‘‘not a role even the federal 
government has the power to make.’’ 
In July, the Director of the Centers 
for Disease Control said: 
There will be no nationwide vaccine man-
date. 
Then, in early September, with this 
Nation in shock and reeling because of 
the disastrous collapse in Afghanistan, 
suddenly and unexpectedly and com-
pletely opposite of everything this ad-
ministration has promised, the Biden 
administration broke the law, and in 
doing so, violated the rights of the 
American people by calling for this 
vaccine mandate. 
Joe Biden issued a nationwide man-
date, and in doing so, he has taken a 
sledgehammer to the American work-
force and the American economy. Be-
cause of the President’s irresponsible 
policies, we now have the worst labor 
shortage in American history, and we 
have broken new records for unfilled 
jobs. As a result, we also have the 
worst supply chain crisis in 40 years. 
We don’t have enough goods on the 
shelves. We don’t have enough workers 
to fill the shelves. 
The President must have known that 
many wouldn’t comply with his man-
date. He must have known people 
would be forced out of their jobs as a 
result of the mandate. He didn’t seem 
to care. He imposed the mandate any-
way. 
Now people are losing their jobs, 
shelves are empty, and prices continue 
to rise. Inflation is the No. 1 concern of 
the American people. 
Now, I am a doctor. I am vaccinated, 
so is my entire family. I am pro-vac-
cine and anti-mandate. Vaccines work. 
Nationwide mandates don’t work. 
Courts have already ruled that the 
President’s mandates are illegal. Yes-
terday, a Federal judge in Georgia 
blocked the mandate on Federal con-
tractors. Not only are these mandates 
illegal, they are ineffective. 
Joe Biden’s mandates have only 
hardened people against the vaccine. 
They have increased resistance to get-
ting 
vaccinated 
because 
President 
Biden has politicized the vaccines, and 
all the mandates have accomplished is 
making people lose their jobs. 
In the Joe Biden world, his mantra 
seems to be, vaccinate or terminate. 
What we ought to be doing, instead, 
is giving people information. Let them 
work with their doctors to make the 
right decision for them and their fami-
lies. 
That is what I have been doing for 
decades in Wyoming as a doctor. We 
don’t need mandates. We don’t need 
public health officials who can give 
Americans reliable information, saying 
they have to enforce and apply a man-
date. They are there to give the infor-
mation and then the vaccine if the per-
son chooses to have it. 
The Biden administration spent 10 
months flip-flopping on this issue. 
President Biden ran from his basement 
during the campaign saying he was the 
answer to COVID. He is not, hasn’t 
been. He has sent one mixed message 
after another, and then he has issued a 
nationwide mandate. It has been incon-
sistent, ineffective, and incompetent. 
When President Biden issued his 
mandate, he said, ‘‘We’ve been patient 
[with the unvaccinated] but our pa-
tience is running thin.’’ 
Well, I will tell you, Mr. President, 
the American people have been patient. 
It is the patience of the American peo-
ple now with you, President Biden, 
that is wearing thin. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senator 
LANKFORD be recognized for up to 6 
minutes, Senator MURPHY for up to 5 
minutes, and that I be recognized last 
for up to 12 minutes prior to the sched-
uled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is 
sort of hard to be able to recognize a 
simple fact that this is the United 
States of America, home of the free, 
land of the brave. 
Then why is it such a difficult con-
versation with so many people in my 
State when they ask this question: Are 
we still free as a nation? 
Why are we having this conversa-
tion? Are we still free as a nation? Of 
course, we are. 
We are having this conversation be-
cause September 9, the President of the 
United States announced he was losing 
patience with the American people, and 
he was going to put a new demand on 
every single office in America, every 
workplace; that anyone who had 100 or 
more people in their company, every 
single person in that company had to 
be vaccinated because the President 
was losing patience with them. He said 
it is for health risk. 
COVID–19 is serious. I have been vac-
cinated. Everyone in my family has 
been vaccinated. I am exceptionally 
grateful for the vaccine. But to be able 
to reach into companies with this one 
simple statement: If you don’t follow 
my instructions, so the President says, 
you will be fired—that every person in 
the country now doesn’t work for their 
employer, they now work for the Presi-
dent of the United States. May I re-
mind us, we are the United States of 
America, home of the free, land of the 
brave; that we are a people who make 
our own decisions and live in a free na-
tion. 
What is interesting is, there is all 
this conversation about everyone needs 
to be vaccinated or we are not going to 
ever get to herd immunity; we will 
never get to herd immunity; we will 
never be able to put down COVID–19. 
How many times have we heard that 
statement over the past year and a 
half? We have got to get to herd immu-
nity. 
Well, I don’t know if anyone has 
looked lately at the CDC’s website. But 
if you go to the CDC website, it will 
list out percentagewise how many peo-
ple have been vaccinated or currently

have natural immunity in their sys-
tem. And if you go to their website and 
see it, the number that they have for 16 
years old and up is 92 percent of Amer-
ica. Ninety-two percent of Americans 
either have natural immunity, anti-
bodies in their system, or they have re-
ceived the vaccine and have that set of 
antibodies in their system. 
May I remind us again, how long 
have we been talking about herd immu-
nity? I understand COVID is a tena-
cious disease. I take it seriously be-
cause, like every single person in this 
room, I have lost family members and 
friends who have died due to COVID. 
But we do not have the right as Ameri-
cans to assign to the President of the 
United States that that President can 
actually go to any company he chooses 
and pick and choose the companies and 
say, this company, everyone has to be 
vaccinated; that company, they don’t. 
If you have 95 people, it is no big deal. 
If you have 100 people, they are toxic. 
If you are FedEx and UPS, you need to 
all be vaccinated, but if you are the 
U.S. Postal Service, you don’t have to 
be vaccinated. That kind of picking 
and choosing that the President has 
done around our economy, that is not 
the role of the U.S. President. 
For all of us who take this disease se-
riously and for all of us who have been 
vaccinated and stand up frequently and 
talk about the importance of vaccina-
tions, we also believe that we are 
Americans and that we are free people. 
So what are the mandates that are 
down now? Well, there was a private- 
sector mandate for every company of 
100 or more. There was a Federal con-
tractor mandate that if you have a 
company that works for the Federal 
Government, regardless of your size for 
any Federal contracting, that you have 
to also have every person vaccinated. 
There are Federal employers who all 
have to be vaccinated, members of the 
military, reaching into the National 
Guard, which, for the first time ever, 
they have violated the law, saying that 
they are going to literally cut the pay 
for members of the National Guard who 
are not vaccinated, though the law 
clearly states they cannot reach into a 
State National Guard and literally 
pick and choose individuals they want 
to pay and don’t pay. They have al-
ready dropped that out there and say-
ing they are going to do that as well. 
They have reached out to members of 
the healthcare community and told 
them, if you have Medicare or Med-
icaid, then you all have to be vac-
cinated. What has been the response? 
The American people have responded 
loud and clear that they believe we live 
in the land of the free. And while mil-
lions and millions have been vac-
cinated, they all turn around and say, 
it was also my choice to be able to do 
that. 
Companies in my State are literally 
requiring employees to sign two forms: 
One saying that they will get vac-
cinated and the second form saying, if 
you have a negative reaction to the 
vaccine, you won’t sue our company. 
What in the world? That is not who 
we are. 
So what has happened in just the last 
couple of weeks? Well, the courts have 
finally gotten involved. First off, the 
courts have done a nationwide stay on 
the private-sector mandate. That is 
what we are talking about tonight, 
putting a nail in the coffin with a vote 
in the U.S. Senate to say: No, we will 
not allow this. 
There has been a nationwide stay put 
in for those individuals that are on 
Medicare 
and 
Medicaid 
and 
those 
healthcare workers. There has been a 
nationwide stay now for Federal con-
tractors, for universities, for individ-
uals around the country that have any 
connection with the Federal Govern-
ment. 
The courts have already stepped in 
and said the President doesn’t have the 
authority to do this, and this vote to-
night is whether this body agrees that 
the President should have unilateral 
power to declare whatever he wants for 
any private-sector business in the 
country or if the President doesn’t 
have that authority to do that. That is 
all this vote is. This vote is not about 
vaccines and, as has been falsely ac-
cused, this whole group of anti-vaxxers 
that are out here. 
This is a very simple vote: Do the 
people in this body believe that the 
President of the United States has the 
authority to declare that any employee 
in any company of 100 or more to do 
what he wants? 
I say no, because we live in the land 
of the free and the home of the brave, 
and it is time for us to go on record on 
if we believe that or not. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, it is 
not often that you get the Business 
Roundtable, which is an organization 
representing some of the biggest pri-
vate-sector companies in the world; the 
largest labor unions in the country; 
and the American public all on the 
same page on a policy. But that is what 
is happening with respect to the Presi-
dent’s requirement that big employers 
in this country either test their em-
ployees regularly for COVID or they 
get vaccinated in order to stop the 
spread of this insidious disease. 
This is a very popular proposal, and 
it is popular for a simple reason: Peo-
ple are exhausted with having their 
lives fundamentally changed, turned 
upside down by a pandemic that we 
have the power to stop. 
We have the power to stop it because 
of researchers and scientists who dis-
covered a vaccine that is wildly more 
effective than the vaccines that have 
been invented to attack other dis-
eases—90 percent effective, if not more, 
against COVID. If everybody got vac-
cinated in this country, we could all 
take off our masks. If everybody was 
vaccinated 
in 
this 
country, 
we 
wouldn’t have to be passing emergency 
relief bills to keep the economy afloat. 
If everybody got vaccinated, we could 
open back up all of our restaurants. 
That is what Americans want. That is 
why this policy is so popular. 
And I understand what my friend 
from Oklahoma is saying, that they are 
not arguing over the efficacy of the 
vaccine, they are just arguing over the 
constitutional powers of the Presi-
dency. 
But come on. Come on. We under-
stand the power of our words in this 
place. Republicans know that when 
they come down to the floor and attack 
the vaccine mandate day after day 
after day, they know they are giving 
fuel to the fire of the anti-vaccine cam-
paign. They know that they have be-
come an extension of those that are 
trying to convince Americans that the 
vaccine has a microchip in it, that the 
vaccine kills you. 
It just strains credibility for my Re-
publican colleagues to suggest that 
there is no connection between the 
anti-vaccination 
campaign 
in 
this 
country and those that are every single 
day on the floor of the Senate talking 
about how dangerous it is to require 
that people in this country get the vac-
cine. There is a connection, and the 
growing movement of people in this 
country who think that the vaccine is 
some conspiracy to hurt people—well, 
this movement to try to end the vac-
cine campaign by the President, it is 
wind underneath their wings. 
But let’s talk about what this policy 
really is because it is actually not a 
mandate for vaccinations. It is a test-
ing mandate. Right? That is what it is. 
What it says is that everybody in these 
big employers has to get tested once a 
week, and if you don’t want to get test-
ed, then your employees can get vac-
cinated. 
Let’s be clear. This is a testing re-
quirement, not a vaccination require-
ment, and that testing requirement is 
totally consistent with the history of 
OSHA. In fact, OSHA is in the business 
of mandating testing. 
OSHA mandates blood testing for in-
dustries with high exposures to lead. 
OSHA mandates hearing tests for in-
dustries with high noise level exposure. 
OSHA mandates testing for exposure to 
silica in industries that are working in 
and around silica. 
OSHA requires testing all the time. 
So that is what they are doing here— 
yes, on a bigger scale and, yes, also 
with an ability to avoid the testing if 
you get vaccinated. But that is what 
this requirement is really all about. 
And it is working. It is working—the 
numbers going from 50 to 96 percent in 
a company like Tyson Foods after the 
vaccine requirement. 
Lastly, let me say this: This general 
lack of seriousness from our Repub-
lican colleagues about a plague that 
has killed 700,000 Americans, it is just 
stunning to me. It is just stunning. 
These aren’t bee stings. These aren’t 
knee scrapes. This is a deadly pan-
demic that has ended the lives of 
700,000 of our mothers and fathers and

sisters and brothers prematurely, hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans who 
should be sitting at the Christmas 
table, who should be at Hanukkah cele-
brations 
with 
their 
families 
this 
month. And they are gone; 700,000 
Americans have disappeared. 
But apparently, the inconvenience of 
a weekly test is so odious, is so revolt-
ing, that it is worth another 700,000 
people dying—because that is what we 
are talking about: a weekly test. The 
OSHA rule does not mandate the vac-
cine; it is a way out of the weekly test, 
a weekly test that is a little swab 
swirled around your nostril five or six 
times for 30 seconds. 
That is the requirement. That is the 
cost, the sky-high, Constitution-vio-
lating, unpatriotic cost the Repub-
licans have been down here on the floor 
railing against for a month. Estimates 
suggest that that requirement can save 
thousands of lives. But apparently, the 
cost of a nose tickle is too great a cost 
to pay to save thousands and thousands 
of Americans from dying from a pre-
ventable pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
effort. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Connecticut, 
and I rise today as well to urge my col-
leagues to vote against this dangerous 
resolution, which would pull the rug 
out from under our COVID response ef-
forts at a really critical moment. 
We are fighting an unprecedented 
pandemic, and we all know just how 
painful this fight has been. Everyone 
remembers the way it upended our 
economy as small businesses shuttered, 
workers got sent home; the way it up-
ended our healthcare system as emer-
gency rooms filled and supplies dwin-
dled and healthcare professionals start-
ed working really long hours in dan-
gerous conditions; the way it upended 
our lives when schools and childcare 
providers were forced to close to keep 
people safe. 
We all know people who have been in-
fected by this deadly virus. We all 
know people who are still fighting the 
effects of long COVID, which we are 
still trying to work to understand. And 
we all know people who have been 
killed by this virus. 
We have lost family members, moth-
ers, daughters, fathers, sons, grand-
parents. We have all lost dear friends. 
We have lost beloved community mem-
bers and frontline workers who keep 
our communities functioning. We have 
lost teachers and principals, doctors, 
nurses, police officers, firefighters. We 
have lost time with each other that we 
cannot get back. 
This virus left no American and no 
part of America alone. COVID has now 
killed over 785,000 people in this coun-
try, more Americans than any war we 
have ever fought. And despite what Re-
publicans seem to believe, given the 
fact we are voting on a resolution to 
undermine a cornerstone policy of our 
pandemic response and despite the 
hard-fought and very real progress we 
have made, this crisis is not over. 
We are still averaging over 100,000 
new cases a day. We still have over 
50,000 people hospitalized with COVID. 
We are still, right now, seeing, on aver-
age, well over 1,000 deaths a day, over-
whelmingly among people who are not 
vaccinated. 
And we are still on high alert for new 
variants. We saw with Delta how a new, 
more dangerous, more contagious vari-
ant of COVID–19 could set back all the 
progress we fought so hard to make, 
and we are at this very moment learn-
ing more about the Omicron variant 
and what sort of threat it might pose. 
So how on Earth does it make sense 
right now to undercut one of the 
strongest tools that we have to get 
people vaccinated and stop this virus? 
In what world is that a good idea? 
We all know the damage this virus 
does to our communities. We should be 
doing everything we can to stop it. We 
should be using every tool to protect 
our country, our economy, and our 
families. 
And we know vaccines are one of the 
best tools we have to do that. It has 
been almost a year now since the first 
vaccine was authorized. After months 
of hoping—remember that?—that news 
meant we finally had a safe, effective 
vaccine to protect people from this 
virus, and we have made a lot of 
progress since then when it comes to 
making the most of vaccines and get-
ting them to people across the country. 
Vaccines are now authorized, as we 
know, for everyone ages 5 and up. 
Booster shots are now available to 
make sure people continue to stay pro-
tected amid concerns over these new 
variants. And around 60 percent of all 
eligible people in our Nation are fully 
vaccinated. 
But we still have a ways to go to vac-
cinate our country and to vaccinate 
the world if we are going to end this 
pandemic. That should be our No. 1 pri-
ority. 
But this resolution that our friends 
across the aisle are offering tonight 
would move us in the opposite direc-
tion. It will take away one of the 
strongest means we have to encourage 
people to get vaccinated, save lives, 
end this pandemic, and keep our eco-
nomic recovery on track. 
Immunization requirements in this 
country are not new. They go back as 
far in our history as General George 
Washington, who required his troops to 
get vaccinated against smallpox. They 
have been critical in the fight of dis-
eases like polio and measles and 
mumps and rubella, just to name a few. 
And the reason we no longer have to 
worry about diseases like smallpox and 
polio in this country is because vac-
cines work. 
Nor are workplace safety standards a 
new thing. The Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration has a long 
track record of setting and enforcing 
safety standards that simply prevent 
workers from getting sick or injured on 
the job. 
OSHA not only has the authority to 
protect workers with safety standards; 
it has been doing this for 50 years. The 
law that established OSHA even gave it 
authority to respond to emergencies by 
issuing an emergency temporary stand-
ard, or ETS, when there is a grave dan-
ger to workers. 
And it makes all the sense in the 
world for them to use that power to 
protect workers from COVID because 
the painful reality is that COVID–19 
has killed a lot of workers. We have 
lost hundreds of meatpacking workers 
and grocery store workers to this 
virus. We lost over 3,600 healthcare 
workers to COVID in 1 year. And over 
10,000 agricultural workers have been 
killed by COVID. 
This is exactly the kind of threat 
OSHA should be protecting people 
against. It is exactly the kind of grave 
danger Congress gave OSHA the au-
thority to issue an ETS to respond to. 
And OSHA has rightfully used that au-
thority to put forward an emergency 
temporary standard on COVID–19 that 
is simple, it is flexible, and it is life-
saving. 
Republicans seem to not be hearing 
this part, so I want to be especially 
clear about it. This requires employers 
with 100 or more employees to make 
sure workers either—either—get vac-
cinated or get a COVID test once a 
week before they go in to the work-
place—either vaccinated or tested once 
a week. 
It also provides, by the way, paid 
time for workers to get vaccinated, re-
moving a key barrier to vaccinations. 
It is a strong tool for getting our Na-
tion vaccinated. And despite how my 
Republican colleagues talk about it, 
letting employers have the flexibility 
to offer a testing option means they 
don’t have to ask workers to leave 
their job if they choose not to get vac-
cinated. 
This step for getting people vac-
cinated or requiring testing is over-
whelmingly popular with American 
people. A poll actually taken shortly 
after President Biden announced this 
step found that 6 in 10 Americans sup-
ported requiring businesses of 100 or 
more to have employees vaccinated or 
tested regularly; and 7 in 10 supported 
making sure people have paid time off 
to get vaccinated. 
Of course, that should be no surprise. 
After all, no one wants to go to work 
worried that they might come home to 
their family with a deadly virus, wor-
ried that they might get their own kids 
sick, which is why getting more people 
vaccinated could help our country get 
back to work. 
We all know people want to work 
where they feel safe. We all want to 
work where we feel safe. And econo-
mists predict that vaccination policies 
could lead to millions of Americans re-
entering the workforce. 
Let’s get something straight: the big 
threat to our workforce and to our

December 8, 2021 
economy is the virus. It is the virus 
that has killed hundreds of thousands 
of people and shuttered businesses. It is 
not the safety standard that will keep 
workers safe and businesses open. 
In fact, this type of safety standard 
is also supported by businesses across 
the country. Many businesses have al-
ready implemented policies like the 
standard Republicans are trying to 
overturn. And you know what has hap-
pened time after time? 
United Airlines, 99 percent of its 
67,000-person workforce has complied 
overwhelmingly by getting vaccinated. 
Tyson Foods went from having less 
than half of its 120,000 workers vac-
cinated to now over 96 percent. MGM 
Resorts has 98 percent of its workers 
vaccinated. Walmart says an over-
whelming majority of employees have 
gotten vaccinated. A Connecticut man-
ufacturer with 250 workers recently an-
nounced 100-percent vaccination rate. 
And that list goes on and on. 
In one place after another, we are 
seeing over 90 percent of workers com-
ply 
with 
this 
requirement—some 
through testing, and the overwhelming 
majority through vaccination. 
The big picture here is that this rule, 
which Republicans keep attacking, is 
saving lives. OSHA estimates it will 
help protect 84 million workers and 
prevent thousands of deaths and over 
250,000 hospitalizations from COVID–19, 
and yet here we are—Republicans push-
ing to scrap it entirely, undermining 
the progress, and putting America lives 
and livelihoods in danger. 
This pandemic has done a lot of dam-
age. It wrecked our economy. It shut 
down our schools and our businesses. It 
forced people to postpone weddings and 
graduations and funerals. It devastated 
our Nation’s mental health. It killed 
over three-quarters of a million people. 
It is not over. We have come a long 
way. This pandemic sent unemploy-
ment as high as 14.8 percent. Today, it 
is back down to 4.2 percent—the lowest 
it has been since the start of the pan-
demic. 
Schools have reopened and brought 
students safely back to classrooms. 
Businesses are hiring. People are get-
ting vaccinated, getting back to work, 
getting back to plans that have been 
put off by this pandemic, and getting 
back to seeing their friends and fami-
lies. But they do not want to go back-
wards. The American people do not 
want to go backwards. And that is ex-
actly where the Republicans’ misin-
formation on commonsense policies 
like this will take us: backwards. 
We know the path forward to finally 
end this involves getting everyone vac-
cinated. We should all be working to-
wards that goal, not against it. Fami-
lies are counting on us to lead our Na-
tion through this crisis, not back into 
it. 
After all we have lost and all the 
hard work we have done to rebuild, we 
must not throw our economy and our 
communities and Americans’ lives into 
jeopardy by sabotaging our pandemic 
response. When you are fighting a fire, 
you don’t stop in the middle of it and 
turn off the water. That is exactly 
what this resolution will do. 
It takes away one of the most impor-
tant tools we have given OSHA to pro-
tect workers, in the middle of a pan-
demic when we need it most, and jeop-
ardize all of the hard work Americans 
have done to get us out of this. 
So I am here tonight to urge my col-
leagues to vote no—no to more lost 
lives, no to a longer pandemic, and to 
join me in defending a commonsense 
tool that will help put this incredibly 
difficult chapter of American life be-
hind us.

(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Kansas. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GRACE 
MILLER 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am 
here tonight to take a moment to rec-
ognize the contributions of a member 
of my staff, Air Force Maj. Grace Mil-
ler, who has spent the last year work-
ing in my personal office as part of the 
U.S. Air Force Congressional Fellow-
ship Program. 
Before Grace departs my office at the 
start of the new year, I express my ap-
preciation to Major Miller for all of her 
tremendously beneficial and hard work 
and her dedication to the service of our 
Nation. 
Grace’s 15 years of service in the U.S. 
Air Force developed her leadership ca-
pabilities and demonstrate her com-
mitment to serving others. These at-
tributes have made her an invaluable 
asset to our team as we work to serve 
Kansans, 
servicemembers, 
and 
vet-
erans. 
Before joining my office, Grace’s as-
signments took her around the world 
in service to our country. Grace earned 
her commission from the University of 
St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. As an air-
craft maintenance officer, Grace has 
served in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Op-
eration Enduring Freedom, and Oper-
ation Inherent Resolve, taking her 
across the Middle East. 
Major Miller’s commitment to serv-
ice also extends to teaching. She 
taught English at the U.S. Air Force 
Academy, earning her the academic 
rank of assistant professor and serving 
as executive officer to the dean of the 
faculty. 
Grace joined our team in January of 
this year. She, since then, has fully 
embraced Kansas, its people, and the 
challenges they face day in and day 
out. Grace’s personal interactions with 
Kansans and Kansas veterans, in par-
ticular, have helped drive meaningful 
policy in a time when our past and 
present servicemembers have needed it 
the most. 
She has spearheaded the Senate pas-
sage of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act of 2021, which 
recognizes the 6888th Central Postal 
Directory Battalion—the only all-Afri-
can-American, all-female battalion to 
be deployed overseas during World War 
II. The 6888, as this battalion has come 
to be known, sorted millions of pieces 
of backlogged mail so troops serving on 
the frontlines could hear from their 
families and loved ones from home. 
Their efforts boosted morale and di-
rectly contributed to our servicemem-
bers’ fighting spirit, particularly to-
ward the end of the war. 
Grace has been a tireless advocate for 
these women, and I commend her dedi-
cation. The bill currently awaits pas-
sage in the House. 
Furthermore, throughout the chaotic 
and disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan, Grace was an indispensable 
resource for veterans and Afghan refu-
gees. She continues to assist innocent 
Afghans 
seeking 
refuge 
from 
the 
Taliban’s tyrannical hold on the coun-
try. 
I want to highlight her efforts in this 
regard. She was tireless and was here 
morning, noon, and night—always with 
the goal of trying to make sure those 
who should be on a plane out of Af-
ghanistan were able to be so. It was an 
emotional issue and a trying issue and 
something that she never conceded: the 
belief that she couldn’t make a dif-
ference. Man, she made a difference in 
so many people’s lives. It gives me the 
chills to tell the story of her dedication 
to this cause. I am so grateful; many 
Kansans are grateful; many Americans 
are grateful that she cared so much. 
I will be sad that she will be leaving 
our office at the end of the month, but 
I know that she will serve the Air 
Force well as she transitions to the Air 
Force Legislative Liaison Office in the 
House of Representatives. 
It was a real pleasure having Grace 
in our office, and I hold her in the high-
est 
regard 
personally 
and 
profes-
sionally. She is a significant asset to 
our Nation and to the U.S. Air Force. 
Grace represents the best of what the 
Air Force has to offer, and I know she 
will continue to benefit the future of 
our Nation. 
I hope that her experience in our of-
fice is something that lends itself to-
ward her further professional advance-
ment within the Air Force and an un-
derstanding of our democratic process. 
There is no group of people I hold in 
higher regard than those who serve our 
Nation, and I want to reiterate my 
gratitude to Grace for her service and 
dedication. 
Once again, thank you, Grace, for all 
you have done for Kansans and for 
Americans in the year that you have 
spent in our office. You have been a 
model of selfless service and leader-
ship. I know that you will continue to 
do great things throughout your Air 
Force career and your life of service, 
wherever that path may lead. 
Grace, thank you so much. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alaska. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
today, I wanted to rise on the Senate 
floor and talk about a topic of utmost 
importance to my State, the great peo-
ple I have the privilege of representing, 
and what the Biden administration is 
doing to good, hard-working American 
families in Alaska. It is what I call the 
anti-Alaska agenda, or the Biden ad-
ministration’s war on working fami-
lies. 
I know that Americans all across the 
country have felt pain—economic pain, 
health pain, unfortunately, too many 
deaths as a result of the pandemic. 
Right now, we are seeing high energy 
prices and empty shelves. There has 
been a lot of suffering in America. We 
are a resilient people, however. 
My State, like many, has been hit 
very hard by the pandemic, particu-
larly economically—our energy sector, 
our fishing sector, our tourism sector. 
And as we are coming out of this pan-
demic and everybody trying to work 
together—we all want growth and op-
portunity in America—we have now 
been hit with this—with this. This ad-
ministration has issued, in its first 9 
months in office, 20 Executive orders 
for Executive actions solely focused on 
Alaska. 
I came down to the floor 2 weeks ago 
to talk about this. It was 19 then. You 
wait a week or 2 with the Biden admin-
istration in Alaska, and it is up to 20. 
I am sure they have a lot more ready 
to go. Twenty—there is no State in 
America that is getting this kind of at-
tention from the Biden administration, 
and we don’t want it. 
What I am going to be continuing to 
ask my Senate colleagues to do—and I 
am going to start with the President of 
the United States, who was a U.S. Sen-
ator for many years, decades—put 
yourself in the shoes of the people I 
represent. 
Let’s imagine that a Republican ad-
ministration comes into office and 
issues 20 Executive orders or Executive 
actions focused on Delaware—tiny, lit-
tle Delaware. The Senators from Dela-
ware, including the former Senator, 
now-President, would be down on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate raising Cain, 
raising heck—I don’t think I am al-
lowed to swear here—because of this, 
because they want to stick up for the 
people they represent. Imagine that. 
These Executive orders and actions 
are not some kind of simple abstrac-
tions; they are 20 orders and actions 
that go to the heart of what Alaskans 
do in terms of our economy: work, 
keeping food on the table, keeping 
lights on in their homes, paying the 
mortgage, keeping their kids in col-
lege, keeping their cultures thriving, 
keeping our communities from crum-
bling, particularly in rural Alaska. 
Some of the poorest communities in 
America is where this administration 
is targeting the people I represent. 
Very few people in my State—Demo-
crat, Republican, Native, non-Native— 
support this war against Alaska. This 
is not a partisan issue back home, and 
here is why: because real people, real 
families, real communities are being 
hurt—your fellow Americans. It has 
got to stop. 
I have demanded a meeting with the 
President and his team to just walk 
him through this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9036 
December 8, 2021 
Mr. President, do you know what you 
are doing to one of your States that 
you are sworn to defend? 
These orders threaten the well-being 
of my entire State, but they particu-
larly threaten the people who live in 
rural Alaska, who are dependent on the 
land and natural resources for so much 
of their economy, so much of their tax 
base. 
Here is the thing, I know what some 
of my colleagues or those who are 
watching are saying: Oh, it is just re-
source development issues in Alaska. 
Well, I will talk about that. It is 
some of that, but it is not just resource 
development issues that are happening 
here. Let me give you one that really 
burns me up. 
We had a bipartisan bill last year, 
last Congress, to provide what you will 
now call racial justice, racial equity, 
to Alaskan Native Vietnam veterans 
who served their country when most 
Americans were avoiding service and 
missed out, because they were overseas 
fighting for their Nation, on the oppor-
tunity to apply for what is called a 
land allotment. There was a deadline 
that happened, a complete injustice. 
Native 
Vietnam 
veterans 
coming 
home, not treated well because they 
are Native, not treated well because 
they are Vietnam veterans, and then 
told: Oh, by the way, the land you were 
supposed to get, you don’t qualify. 
So we got a bill to pass to say that is 
an injustice. The previous administra-
tion signed it. They were implementing 
it. And when this administration came 
into office, the No. 1 issue I asked Sec-
retary Haaland to commit to was to 
finish getting the Executive order out 
on these land allotments to implement 
this bipartisan bill because these Na-
tive Vietnam veterans aren’t living 
that long. 
The administration delayed it for 2 
years. Why? It has nothing do to with 
oil and gas or mining. Why? These 
Vietnam vets, many aren’t going to 
live for 2 more years. They did it any-
way. 
That is 1 of 20. Let me give you an-
other one. 
We have had, down in southeast Alas-
ka, the issue of the Tongass—that is 
the largest national forest in the coun-
try. Every elected official—Governor, 
Senator, 
Democrat, 
Republican—in 
Alaska, the last 30 years, has pressed 
with the roadless rule, an exemption to 
the roadless rule, so we can have an 
economy there; roads for southeast 
communities. Every elected Governor 
or U.S. Senator, didn’t matter the 
party, that is how important this was. 
We were able to get an exemption in 
the last administration. I appreciate 
what President Trump did on that. 
This administration comes in, and 
they reverse it. One of the 20. Guess 
how we, the Alaska delegation, found 
out about that reversal. A front-page 
story in the Washington Post. The Sec-
retary of Agriculture wanted to brief 
the Washington Post and all the ex-
treme environmental groups who want-
ed this before they let the people of 
Alaska or their representatives know. 
These are the examples. 
And, yes, the list also includes re-
source development projects. But here 
is the thing on that—I have a folder 
full of letters. These are letters from 
the elected leaders, Tribal leaders, bor-
ough leaders, Alaska Native Corp. lead-
ers, Native leaders in my State—dozens 
of letters. Kaktovik Inupiat Corpora-
tion, Native village of Kaktovik—that 
is a Tribe—City of Utqiagvik, City of 
Atqasuk, City of Wainwright, Inupiaq 
Community of the Arctic Slope—that 
is another Tribe—the Voice of the 
Inupiat Arctic, these are all Alaskan 
Native leaders who live in the North 
Slope, some of whom live in the Arctic 
National Wildlife area. Every single 
one of these great leaders in my State, 
every one, was writing, even begging, 
this administration not to do this—not 
to do this. And they ignored them— 
they ignored them. 
This is a letter from Edward Rexford. 
He is the President of the Native Vil-
lage of Kaktovik. He wrote to Sec-
retary Deb Haaland after she suspended 
oil and gas leases in the ANWR, which 
we passed. What the Secretary did, in 
my view, was clearly illegal. 
Edward Rexford wrote: ‘‘You have 
changed our future with one stroke of 
a pen without any explanation or con-
sultation with us—the tribe that lives 
within the Coastal Plain.’’ 
His village, Kaktovik, is the only vil-
lage within the coastal area of ANWR. 
That is it. There is no group of Ameri-
cans who should have a greater voice in 
the development of this area than 
them. But they didn’t even get a phone 
call—not a phone call, not consulta-
tion, Tribal consultation, which is re-
quired by law—none of it. 
That is all part of the 20 Executive 
orders and actions that I said are hurt-
ing people, hurting communities, hurt-
ing families, hurting Native cultures. 
I will tell you this: The Biden admin-
istration loves to talk about how they 
are committed to environmental jus-
tice and racial equity, but it is with a 
caveat. 
Here is the reality: They want to 
help unserved minority populations 
around the country. And I think this is 
a good goal, but it comes with a ca-
veat. Unless, of course, they are indige-
nous people of Alaska, then the Biden 
administration targets them. 
Look at this folder. These are com-
munities of color in my State, and all 
they do is get targeted, not helped; tar-
geted, their economic opportunity. And 
then the things that most Americans 
take for granted that don’t exist in 
these 
communities—clinics, 
flushed 
toilets, gymnasiums—all of that comes 
with economic opportunity. And when 
you shut it down, you are really hurt-
ing indigenous people in some of the 
most impoverished communities in the 
country. But I guess they seem OK 
with that. 
I want all of my Senate colleagues to 
do just a quick thought experiment. 
Imagine what it would be like, whether 
you are a Democrat or a Republican— 
but just think about it: A Democrat 
and a Republican administration comes 
in or you are a Republican and a Demo-
crat 
administration 
comes 
in 
and 
changes the future of your State with a 
stroke of a pen, as Edward Rexford 
said, for the people you represent. 
Imagine an administration coming in 
with 20 Executive orders in 8 months, 
shutting down your economy as you 
are trying to get out of a pandemic. 
Every Senator here would be mad. 
Every Senator here would be mad. And 
the one thing I very much enjoy about 
serving in this body is we are a colle-
gial body. We have our differences, but 
I certainly have friends on both sides of 
the aisle, try to work with everybody, 
try to be respectful with everybody. 
The Presiding Officer and I chaired 
committees together, worked together 
on a lot of things. 
And here is the thing, if a Republican 
administration came into power and 
targeted one of my colleague’s States 
with 20 Executive orders in 8 months 
and whoever it was came to me and 
said: ‘‘Hey, DAN, you know this is un-
fair. My constituents are really being 
attacked, really being hurt. Could you 
reach out to the Republican adminis-
tration and say: Hey, come on. Tone it 
down. Geez, Louise, 20 Executive orders 
in one State,’’ I would help, and I think 
almost every Senator here would help. 
That is what we do here. 
And I want to say that some of my 
Democratic colleagues here, when I 
have talked about this, when I have 
told them about this, when I have spo-
ken about this, a number of them have 
come to me and said: ‘‘Hey, DAN, give 
me the list. Give me the list of 20. 
Maybe I can’t help you on every one of 
them, all of them. Maybe there are 
some I actually like. But I do want to 
try and help.’’ 
That is what has happened. That is 
what makes this body a good place. To 
those Senators, I really want to thank 
you. And I am going to ask for your 
help because I would do it for you. 
And this is unacceptable. Tens of 
thousands of people I represent are 
being hurt by the Federal Government, 
by the President and his White House. 
So I appreciate that from my col-
leagues. And this is, in general, how 
this body works. It makes this a spe-
cial place. 
But I will say this. Not all Senators 
have been so gracious and senatorial 
and collegial. To the contrary, a few of 
my colleagues are helping lead the 
charge in the war on Alaska’s working 
families. They seem to be putting a ton 
of effort into it themselves. I am not 
sure why, but they spend a lot of their 
time and energy focused on doing this: 
shutting down the Alaska economy, 
hurting working families, and ridicu-
lously and absurdly acting as if they 
speak for the very people I am privi-
leged to represent, as if they don’t have 
enough to do in terms of helping their 
own constituents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9037 
December 8, 2021 
So I am going to make an example 
and give an example of one. The leader 
of this small group is the senior Sen-
ator from New Mexico. Here is a sam-
pling—three letters in the last year 
and a half he has written, signed, or 
led, focusing on shutting down Alas-
ka’s economy and hurting the great 
people I have the privilege of rep-
resenting. 
Two of these letters deal with the 
1002 area of the Arctic National Wild-
life Refuge—controversial, no doubt. In 
2017, we voted to provide the oppor-
tunity for development in that small 
area, what we call the 1002 area. The 
President signed it. It came into law. 
Now, I know most of my colleagues 
on the Democratic side didn’t agree 
with that. We have legislation we don’t 
agree with. I accept that. I am still 
very good friends with so many. 
But, afterward, the senior Senator 
from New Mexico led letters to all the 
top banks in America and all the top 
insurance and financial institutions in 
America and didn’t just say don’t in-
vest in the ANWR but said ‘‘don’t in-
vest in any oil and gas development 
project in the Arctic.’’ 
What is that, the Arctic of America? 
That is my State. 
So now you have, as opposed to 
collegiality, a small group, led by this 
Senator, writing the biggest banks in 
America, the biggest financial institu-
tions in America, trying to muscle 
them, saying: Don’t invest anything in 
Alaska. 
That is not what this body is all 
about. I would never do that to a col-
league. I would never write all the 
banks of America and say: Don’t invest 
in poor communities, Native commu-
nities in New Mexico or in the New 
Mexico oil and gas industry. I wouldn’t 
do that. 
Who does that? 
Well, 
unfortunately, 
a 
few—not 
many, a few—Senators are doing that. 
Absurdly, this Senator had the au-
dacity, in one of his letters, to try to 
speak for the people I represent. He put 
in the letter: The people dependent on 
the Arctic Refuge don’t want you to in-
vest there. 
That is patently absurd. Just read 
the letters from all the people who ac-
tually live there, all the people who 
live there, who overwhelmingly want 
opportunities for oil and gas develop-
ment and for jobs and economic oppor-
tunity. 
You would think, with all of New 
Mexico’s problems, this Senator would 
focus on his own constituents. 
So I reached out to him and the few 
others who wrote these letters. I have 
reached out. I wrote my own letter to 
them saying: Hey, I was disappointed 
to see you do that. Why didn’t you 
come talk to me? I wouldn’t do that to 
you. And, by the way, what you are 
doing is really going to hurt my con-
stituents. 
This is a letter I wrote to this Sen-
ator and a few others: I would appre-
ciate the courtesy of talking about this 
before you go do it. You clearly don’t 
understand the indigenous commu-
nities that I represent. 
I even provided a Wall Street Journal 
op-ed from the mayor of the North 
Slope Borough, Harry Brower, the 
Inupiaq mayor, who had a lot to say to 
the banks who weren’t going to invest 
in his community. 
But I got no response. To the con-
trary, just a few months ago, this same 
Senator led a letter to the Secretary of 
the Interior, Deb Haaland, asking her 
to shut down a very important energy 
development in Alaska called the Wil-
low Project. This is that letter—just 
about 4 months ago. 
Let 
me 
talk 
about 
the 
Willow 
Project. The Willow Project is not in a 
controversial area; it is in the National 
Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, set aside 
by Congress decades ago for oil and gas 
development. Every Native group in 
Alaska supports this project, all the 
unions do, 2,000 direct jobs, billions in 
revenues for some of the poorest com-
munities in America, the lowest emis-
sions of any major oil and gas develop-
ment project in America. 
This is a huge win-win-win for every-
body—not even controversial. Yet the 
senior Senator from New Mexico wrote 
Deb Haaland saying: Shut down the 
Willow Project in Alaska. 
Why is he doing this, literally trying 
to kill thousands of Alaskan jobs and 
impoverish 
Alaska 
Native 
commu-
nities? 
Do the people in New Mexico know 
that their senior Senator spends so 
much time trying to give Alaska oil 
and gas workers pink slips and impov-
erish Native communities? I wonder. I 
wonder. 
I thought, for just a moment, maybe 
I should do something against New 
Mexico, but then I was like, no; you 
know what, that is not my style. I 
wouldn’t want to hurt New Mexico oil 
and gas workers or Native commu-
nities. They are all great Americans, I 
am sure. We are a great country. I 
wouldn’t want to target them the way 
this Senator is targeting my State, 
trying to hurt thousands of Alaskan 
working families. 
And it should be emphasized and I 
want to emphasize, that is not how we 
work here. That is not what I have seen 
in my almost 7 years in the U.S. Sen-
ate, Senators trying to attack other 
Senators’ States, specifically focusing 
on hurting working families. 
The vast majority of the Senators I 
know wouldn’t do that at all. That is 
not how business is conducted here in 
the U.S. Senate. To the contrary, most 
of us generally try to help each other. 
We don’t always agree; that is for sure. 
But particularly when States have 
unique challenges that could hurt their 
citizens, when my colleagues would 
come to me, ‘‘Hey, Dan, can you help 
out on this,’’ I usually try to help. But 
I certainly don’t go on offense and try 
to hurt like this administration is 
doing and the senior Senator from New 
Mexico. 
But I thought the better course to 
fight back—because I am going to fight 
back, OK. I am going to fight back. 
These are my constituents who are 
hurting. The better course to fight 
back against these attacks on Alaskan 
working families was not to try to hurt 
New Mexicans but just show this, the 
rank hypocrisy of what the senior Sen-
ator is actually doing and saying. 
One of his main reasons, in this lat-
est letter, to shut down Alaska, in try-
ing to deny Federal permits for the 
Willow oil and gas project, is to 
‘‘achieve climate goals.’’ OK? That is 
in his letter to Deb Haaland. 
But if you do just a little digging, 
this Senator seems fine with trying to 
achieve these goals on the backs of 
Alaskan workers and Alaska Natives 
but not on his own constituents, not on 
the backs of his own constituents—to 
the contrary. 
Guess which State in America has 
gotten way more Federal oil and gas 
drilling permits than any other State 
in the country—guess which one. It is 
certainly not Alaska. It happens to be 
New Mexico. It just so happens to be 
New Mexico. 
Guess where the Secretary of the In-
terior is from. New Mexico. Hmm. Is 
that a coincidence? I wonder, in their 
frequent phone calls, when they talk 
about concerns of climate and shutting 
down oil and gas in Alaska, if shutting 
down oil and gas in New Mexico ever 
comes up. 
I am pretty sure it doesn’t. How do I 
know that? Because close to half of all 
oil and gas drilling permits issued by 
the Department of the Interior, by New 
Mexican Deb Haaland, in 2021 have 
gone to one State. What State is that? 
New Mexico—2,286 Federal oil and gas 
drilling permits; almost half of all the 
permits in the country to one State. 
So here is the bottom line. Here is 
their view. Shut down Alaska, hurt 
working 
families 
in 
Alaska, 
sup-
posedly, to help America’s climate 
goals, but then quietly say ‘‘drill, baby, 
drill’’ in New Mexico, with more per-
mits by far than any other State in the 
country—almost 2,300. If that is not 
rank hypocrisy, I don’t know what is. 
So I am going to start asking ques-
tions about this and, by the way, so 
should the press. I sure hope our 
friends in the press think that, hmm, 
there is something a little strange 
going on here. Clearly, there is hypoc-
risy happening. But, you know, that 
happens here occasionally—or maybe 
more than occasionally. But is there 
anything else going on? 
And I hope the press in New Mexico 
ask their senior Senator why he is so 
darn focused on hurting the good peo-
ple of Alaska—because I wouldn’t do 
that to New Mexican oil and gas work-
ers or New Mexican Native commu-
nities. 
And finally, I am going to ask ques-
tions in another area. The Biden ad-
ministration is clearly trying to shut 
down my State. It is there for every-
body to see. Everybody back home

knows it. But here is the thing. They 
can’t do it illegally, and they can’t do 
it unethically. And right now there is 
strong evidence that they are doing 
just that. 
What do I mean? Today, I sent this 
letter that I would like to be printed in 
the RECORD to the inspector general of 
the Department of the Interior. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Hon. MARK LEE GREENBLATT, 
Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Inte-
rior, Washington, DC. 
INSPECTOR GENERAL GREENBLATT, I write 
to express my deep concern and to request 
relevant materials related to several Depart-
ment of Interior (DOI) appointees that are 
utilizing their government positions to work 
on matters directly and substantially related 
to their previous clients or employers to the 
benefit of these entities. These actions raise 
dire conflicts of interest and questions as to 
these appointees’ impartiality under Execu-
tive Order 13989 and related United States 
ethics laws. These individuals have made 
key decisions to overturn, review, and delay 
resource development projects and land man-
agement plans in Alaska that they and their 
former employers or clients were actively 
opposing prior to their appointments. I ask 
that you supply all relevant information re-
quested below so we may have a full under-
standing of these appointees apparent and 
likely conflicts of interest. I further ask that 
your office consider opening an ethics inves-
tigation into the work of these appointees. 
Executive Order 13989 requires all ap-
pointees to sign a pledge to ‘‘not for a period 
of 2 years from the date of [their] appoint-
ment participate in any particular matter 
involving specific parties that is directly and 
substantially related to [their] former em-
ployer or former clients, including regula-
tions and contracts.’’ Beyond the E.O., 5 CFR 
§ 2635.502(a)(2) requires appointees to consult 
with ethics officials and receive approval 
prior to participating personally and sub-
stantially in a matter where a reasonable 
person with knowledge of the relevant facts 
would question their impartiality. It has 
come to my attention that such apparent 
conflicts of interest certainly exist for the 
political appointees discussed below and to 
the best of my knowledge none have received 
the requisite approval as required by federal 
law and regulation. 
Ms. Nada Culver currently serves as the 
Deputy Director of Policy and Programs at 
the Bureau of Land Management. Prior to 
her appointment, she worked as Vice Presi-
dent, Public Lands and Senior Policy Coun-
sel at the National Audubon Society and 
served as the Senior Counsel and Senior Di-
rector of Policy and Planning at the Wilder-
ness Society. The Audubon Society was en-
gaged in petitions and lawsuits to halt five 
Public Land Orders affecting Alaska signed 
by the Secretary of Interior under the last 
administration, challenges to the National 
Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR-A) 2020 In-
tegrated Activity Plan (IAP), Environmental 
Impact Statement on the Willow Projects, 
challenges to the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge oil and gas leasing program, and the 
Ambler Road project. It has come to my at-
tention that Ms. Culver has been personally 
and substantially involved in decisions at 
the DOI related to delaying PLOs, announc-
ing reviews of the IAP, the Ambler Road 
project, and the 1002 leasing program. Ms. 
Culvers impartiality on these matters is 
plainly questionable, and again her involve-
ment on these issues likely violates ethics 
laws and regulations. 
Prior to her appointment, Ms. Natalie 
Landreth, presently Deputy Solicitor for 
Lands, worked for the Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF). In this position Ms. 
Landreth counseled and represented NARF 
in 
comments 
and 
petitions 
on 
various 
projects and management plans under con-
sideration by DOI, including the EIS for the 
oil and gas leasing program in the 1002 Area 
and the Willow project. In addition, she 
counseled an Alaska tribal organization as 
they sought to prevent the development of 
the Ambler Road project, which the DOJ, at 
DOI’s behest, moved to stay for further re-
view of the project, in line with petitions 
from this same organization. NARF’s aggres-
sive opposition towards, and request for fur-
ther review of, a multitude of development 
projects now currently being reviewed by the 
DOI raises serious concerns now that their 
former staff attorney, Ms. Landreth, is a 
part of the team conducting those very re-
views. Since her appointment, it has come to 
my attention that Ms. Landreth has been di-
rectly and substantially involved in the DOI 
decisions concerning these projects, advanc-
ing NARFs agenda without approval from 
ethics officials. 
Prior to her appointment as Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary for Land and Mineral Manage-
ment, Ms. Laura Daniel Davis worked for the 
National Wildlife Federation (NWF). As 
Chief of Policy and Advocacy, Ms. Davis 
oversaw NWF’s campaign to reverse the 1002 
Area lease sale order included in the 2017 Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act. NWF also pursued a stra-
tegic campaign to invalidate the painstaking 
work of the DOI on the NPR-A 2020 IAP. 
Now, in a position of public trust, Ms. Davis 
has advanced her former employers goals— 
recalling and reviewing the IAP. Any reason-
able person would at the very least perceive 
a conflict of interest if not outright malfea-
sance in Ms. Davis invalidating the finalized 
2020 IAP as her former employer has advo-
cated for, especially in the absence of an eth-
ics approval. 
Finally, Robert L. Anderson, formerly 
Principal Deputy Solicitor for the Depart-
ment of Interior, and now Solicitor of the 
Department of the Interior, was previously 
the director of the Native American Law 
Center at the University of Washington 
School of Law and a staff attorney for 
NARF. Mr. Anderson was instrumental in es-
tablishing the NARF Anchorage Office that 
now consistently opposes and challenges any 
and all resource development in Alaska. Mr. 
Anderson himself has authored a number of 
articles detailing his personal disdain for the 
Alaska 
Native 
Claims 
Settlement 
Act 
(ANCSA) and natural resource development. 
After consistently denouncing the DOI in its 
handling of tribal and Alaska Native issues, 
Mr. Anderson has now been appointed as the 
DOI’s chief advocate. The DOI has numerous 
responsibilities under ANCSA and oversees 
resource development in much of Alaska. 
Any reasonable person that has read Mr. An-
derson’s works would certainly question his 
impartiality and ability to effectively rep-
resent the Department he has long decried. 
With such direct and substantial conflicts 
of interests being ignored, the positions of 
their former employers and clients are being 
advanced through a subversion of unbiased 
analysis, constituting arbitrary and capri-
cious actions, fraud, waste, and abuse, and 
violation of federal ethics laws and regula-
tions. To the best of my knowledge, none of 
these appointees have received a waiver from 
EO 13989 or 5 CFR § 2635.502(a)(2) making 
their violations not only unethical but clear-
ly illegal. When such behavior rears its head 
there is a responsibility to the public to in-
vestigate and expose every improper action 
taken. The American people expect, and the 
law demands, impartial decision making by 
those privileged to serve in the U.S. govern-
ment. None of these individuals—as relates 
to decisions made about Alaska—appear to 
be abiding by the law. 
For that reason, I am requesting the fol-
lowing documents within the next 30 days: 
Copies of the signed and dated ethics 
pledge for each of the above listed officials; 
Any and all communications and docu-
mentation concerning ethics consultations 
and waivers issued to the officials discussed 
above; 
Any and all recusals made by the above 
listed officials; 
All internal communications (including 
Microsoft Teams chats and texts from per-
sonal cell phones) concerning the re-opening 
of the NPRA IAP to, from, and amongst the 
above listed officials and the White House; 
Any and all communications between the 
above listed officials and their former em-
ployers and clients since their appointments 
(including Microsoft Teams chats and texts 
from communications devices); 
Any and all communications and opinions 
to and from the Solicitor’s Office concerning 
the legal sufficiency of the NPR-A IAP and 
the grounds for re-opening it (including 
Microsoft Teams chats and texts from com-
munications devices); 
A timeline of the conversations and deci-
sions made at the Department of the Interior 
and among its officials that led to the review 
of the NPRA IAP, the 1002 leasing program, 
Ambler Road project, and the delay of the 
five PLOs; 
A detailed explanation of the purpose and 
need for re-opening the NPRA IAP that pin-
points any perceived insufficiencies; 
Any and all records of tribal consultations 
done in connection with the decision to re- 
open the NPRA IAP (including Microsoft 
Teams chats and texts from communications 
devices); 
Public service demands an objective duty 
to the nation above all else. Government of-
ficials have a duty to serve the people and 
uphold the law they have been entrusted to 
execute. An impartial administration of the 
law is essential to safeguarding our demo-
cratic values and must never concede to pri-
vate agendas. I am deeply troubled by the 
disdain these officials have demonstrated for 
ethics rules and the institutional damage 
such disregard has caused. Moreover, I have 
raised these issues directly with Secretary 
Haaland and Solicitor Anderson, but have 
been ignored. Finally, almost all the likely 
unethical decisions at issue here are focused 
on shutting down responsible resource devel-
opment in Alaska, hurting working families 
throughout my great state. For that reason, 
I will work tirelessly to bring the full extent 
of these unlawful improprieties to light. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Here is what I am 
asking in this letter. There is very 
strong evidence that at least four sen-
ior political appointees at the Depart-
ment of the Interior who have been in-
volved in many of these 20 Executive 
orders and Executive actions shutting 
down my State were actually, in their 
previous jobs, working on the very 
same issues and advocating for the 
very same outcome—meaning they are 
working with a special interest group 
to say shut down the Willow Project. 
And then when it came to the Inte-
rior, they are working on whether or 
not to shut down the Willow Project. 
Now, most of us know, if that is true, 
that is clearly illegal and clearly un-
ethical. 
We have documented this letter—four

cials, all of whom who are trying to

shut down my State—and I think there 
is strong evidence that they are vio-
lating ethics laws and violating the 
law. So I have asked for a detailed in-
vestigation by the Department of the 
Interior Inspector General into wheth-
er or not these individuals have vio-
lated Federal ethics laws in their quest 
to hurt working families in my State. 
Let me conclude with this. I am a 
supporter of responsible resource devel-
opment in America of all of the above: 
energy, wind, solar, oil—in every part 
of our great country, in Alaska, of 
course, in New Mexico—all across our 
great land. And I am a supporter of the 
great men and women who do this in 
Alaska and New Mexico and Texas and 
North Dakota. 
What is happening in my State right 
now, this is just wrong, and I am going 
to fight. And any other Senator who 
would be going through what my State 
is going through, with your constitu-
ents being harmed, you would be down 
on the floor fighting, too. 
The vast majority of the U.S. Sen-
ators 
here—Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans—I think deep down in their 
hearts know that this is just wrong. 
You don’t come in with a new adminis-
tration and say, Hey, let me target one 
State and beat the heck out of their 
working families. It is just wrong. 
And I am hopeful that my colleagues 
here—and I am asking them because we 
need the help. I have great people I rep-
resent—proud, tough people, but I can’t 
fight the whole damn Federal Govern-
ment when they are focused on shut-
ting you down. So I am hopeful that 
my colleagues—all of my colleagues; I 
will share the list of the 20—that you 
can help me get the Biden administra-
tion and some misguided hypocritical 
U.S. Senators to enact a cease-fire in 
their war on working families and Na-
tive communities in the great State of 
Alaska. 
I yield the floor.

f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. LOUIS UCCELLINI 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
rise today to acknowledge that the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration will soon lose a fine pub-
lic servant to retirement. The National 
Weather Service’s director, Dr. Louis 
Uccellini, is retiring at the end of this 
year. The National Weather Service— 
NWS—produces the weather forecasts 
and products that we rely on a daily 
basis. These predictions are critical for 
protecting lives and property around 
the country, and Dr. Uccellini has 
played a big part of this work for the 
last several decades. Before I mention 
any specific accomplishments, let me 
share a couple of numbers: 43 years of 
public service, 70 published scientific 
articles and chapters in books, and 
more than 4,500 employees working out 
of some 168 units or offices. 
Dr. Uccellini—or Louis, as he urges 
people to call him—has been passionate 
about weather since he was a small 
child. A tremendous snowstorm caught 
his attention during his youth, and 
even now, he is still fascinated by win-
ter weather, so much so that among 
the many offices, teams, and even orga-
nizations he founded is the Winter 
Weather desk at the Weather Pre-
diction Center. Among his many sci-
entific accomplishments, Dr. Uccellini 
co-wrote what has been deemed the 
most authoritative study on winter 
weather, appropriately called ‘‘North-
east Snowstorms.’’ 
There is no aspect of today’s weather 
forecast that Dr. Uccellini didn’t either 
pioneer, or improve, from models that 
focus on individual phenomena or 
areas, to the first ensemble models, to 
seasonal forecasting models and even 
space weather. Louis established uni-
fied workstations that let forecasters 
view and assimilate multiple data in-
puts, and he took an entire forecast di-
vision from analog to digital. His abil-
ity to look at and integrate multiple 
types of data inputs and computer sys-
tems is why we as a nation can look 
from a daily forecast to weekly to sub-
seasonal to seasonal. He introduced 
and integrated ocean, wave, water, air 
quality, and space models with weather 
models and oversaw all nine of the 
NWS’s National Centers for Environ-
mental Prediction before being tapped 
to lead the entire National Weather 
Service. 
Yet Louis is much more than a sci-
entist. His leadership of NWS and pio-
neering cultural and organizational 
changes led the Federal contracting 
trade publication FCW to name him in 
2020 as one of America’s top 100 Gov-
ernment Executives, and he was se-
lected to serve as a National Academy 
of Public Administration Fellow. The 
ability to lead and manage an organi-
zation is difficult even when adminis-
tration is one’s primary profession. It 
is a large secondary hat for a scientist 
to wear, and Louis wore it with 
aplomb, taking the National Weather 
Service to new heights of organization, 
service, and professionalism. 
In 2013, Louis took the helm of the 
Weather Service. He improved the or-
ganization’s financial management by 
creating a budget and organizational 
structure that mirrored the forecast 
process. All of NWS is now in align-
ment: the forecast process, budget 
portfolio and management structure, 
creating a stronger sense of mission, 
and delivering transparency both inter-
nally and externally. He truly righted 
the ship. He actually embraced exter-
nal audits and advice from consultants 
and proactively circled back to review 
changes he was leading at NWS. 
One event comes to mind when I 
think of what will define Uccellini’s 
most lasting legacy. In April 2011, a 
dramatic and devastating tornado out-
break that struck our southern States 
killed 316 people even though the NWS 
had been warning partners and the 
community for days in advance. The 
tragic number of lives lost, despite 
multiple warnings, led Louis to lead 
the Weather Service into a new model 
for communication called Impact-based 
Decision Support Services, IDSS. The 
launch of IDSS was a sea change in 
NWS operations in which the forecast 
is not an end product but a starting 
point for forecasters to help emergency 
managers 
advise 
communities. 
By 
deepening Weather Service partner-
ships with emergency managers, IDSS 
has increased forecast effectiveness 
and saved lives. Louis led the NWS to-
ward its goal of creating a Weather- 
Ready Nation, increasing community 
and individual readiness and resilience. 
There are few public servants like 
Louis Uccellini. He has strengthened 
our Nation’s research on and resilience 
to extreme weather events. On behalf 
of my constituents in New Hampshire, 
I thank Dr. Uccellini for his decades of 
excellent service to our Nation and 
wish him well in his retirement. He 
will be missed.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL CHRIS RYAN 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor an exceptional 
member of the U.S. Air Force. I am 
proud to enter this tribute into the 
RECORD as I have had the pleasure of 
traveling with Chris to London and 
Ukraine and saw firsthand his profes-
sionalism, leadership, and dedication 
to duty. 
Lt. Col. Christopher ‘‘Chris’’ Ryan 
has distinguished himself through his 
professional character and dedication 
by serving this Nation in uniform. A 
leader and expert communicator, he 
has provided distinguished service to 
our country while assigned to the Air 
Force Senate Liaison Office. He is an 
outstanding leader and the perfect air-
man to represent the Air Force on Cap-
itol Hill. Chris has served in the Air 
Force for over 20 years in both the en-
listed and officer ranks. As an aircraft 
maintenance officer, Chris has led 
thousands of maintainers in support of 
the AC–130H, C–17A, KC–135R, and C–5M 
aircraft. 
Throughout his career, Chris has 
demonstrated his exceptional abilities; 
he was the 1997 Airman of the Year at 
Joint Base Andrews and recipient of 
the John Levitow Award in 2000. Chris 
was both distinguished graduate for 
the ROTC Detachment 330 at the Uni-
versity of Maryland-College Park and 
at the Advanced Maintenance and Mu-
nitions Operations School. Further, 
Chris was recognized as the 2019 Sec-
retary of the Air Force, Legislative Li-
aison Reserve Officer of the Year. Prior 
to his current assignment, Chris had 
the privilege of being selected as an Air 
Force Legislative Fellow where he was 
detailed to the Congressional Research 
Service and then worked for my dear 
colleague, the senior Senator from 
Oklahoma and then-chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee in 2018. 
As a legislative liaison in the Air 
Force Senate Liaison Office from De-
cember 2018 to December 2021, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Ryan performed his duties 
well and without reservation 
sup-
porting the 115th, 116th, and 117th U.S. 
Congresses. His strategic thinking and 
foresight helped to strengthen and im-
prove our national security. Chris ac-
complished this utilizing his in-depth

Air Force knowledge with numerous 
engagements between Congress and the 
Department of the Air Force. 
Chris expertly conveyed Department 
of the Air Force positions on the Air 
Force Future Design that included the 
future bomber, tanker, and fighter 
force. Chris’ direct support provided 
the U.S. Senate critical information 
necessary for three National Defense 
Authorization Acts. His efforts helped 
establish the U.S. Space Force, ensure 
the confirmation of the 25th and 26th 
Air Force Secretaries, the 22nd Air 
Force Chief of Staff, and ensured the 
Department of the Air Force support of 
the National Defense Strategy in our 
return to Great Power Competition. 
Lieutenant Colonel Ryan planned 
and led delegations for Members of 
Congress on visits all over the world to 
include the bicameral Commission on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe 
and 
the 
Reagan 
National 
Defense 
Forum. In fact, Chris escorted me to 
the United Kingdom and Ukraine in 
2019. Chris’ significant efforts led to 
successful engagements between this 
governing body and senior Department 
of Defense Officials, including the Sec-
retary of the Air Force. All of these en-
gagements helped U.S. Senators under-
stand defense equities and their impact 
on national security. Due to his direct 
involvement and stewardship, Members 
of Congress were able to make in-
formed decisions and ensure the De-
partment of the Air Force was properly 
resourced and funded. 
After serving in this vital role for the 
past 3 years and becoming a fixture on 
Capitol Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Ryan 
will move to his next assignment, as 
deputy group commander, 514th Main-
tenance Group, located at Joint Base 
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. Chris, his wife 
Rachel—the chief of staff for the Bu-
reau of Arms Control, Verification, and 
Compliance 
at 
the 
Department 
of 
State—and 
their 
children 
Joshua, 
Kathrine, and Emma have sacrificed 
much as a family in service to our Na-
tion. I am thankful for Chris’ service 
and his work with my office and the 
Senate over the past 3 years on issues 
important to this great Nation. I sa-
lute this American patriot whose self-
less service has kept our country safe 
and strong. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO STAFF 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, over 
the past couple of years, Ohioans and 
Americans around the country have 
worked and sacrificed to get our coun-
try through this pandemic. Among 
those who have risen to meet this his-
toric moment are the dedicated public 
servants on our Senate staff. These pa-
triots have given their all over these 
last 20 months to protect Ohioans’ 
health, to put money in people’s pock-
ets, to keep a roof over people’s heads, 
and to help our State and our country 
overcome this health and economic cri-
sis. 
I would not have been able to do the 
vital work we have done in the Senate 
without their expertise and dedication 
and talent, and we would not be where 
we are today as a country—with rising 
wages, record job growth, and life-
saving vaccines—without them. This

leagues to join me in thanking these

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF RICELAND 
FOODS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of Riceland Foods. 
Riceland’s success story mirrors the 
growth of rice production in Arkansas. 
The first rice crop grown in Arkansas 
was produced in 1904. As more Arkan-
sas farmers embraced this new crop, 
they found that relying on buyers from 
Texas 
or 
Louisiana, 
who 
passed 
through Arkansas infrequently, made 
sales difficult. That led farmers to 
build Arkansas’ first rice mill in Stutt-
gart in 1907. 
Stuttgart would soon become the 
center of Arkansas’ burgeoning rice in-
dustry. In the years around World War 
I, rice crop prices fluctuated wildly, 
leading Arkansas producers to meet in 
Stuttgart to find a path to ensure con-
tinued viability. The Arkansas Rice 
Growers Cooperative Association was 
born out of this gathering. 
The cooperative began as only a rice 
sales organization. As rice farming be-
came more popular in Arkansas, the 
Arkansas Rice Growers Cooperative 
Association began leasing and eventu-
ally purchasing mills to process rice 
grown by area farmers. 
In 1946, the cooperative began mar-
keting its products under the Riceland 
label. In 1960, it diversified by merging 
with the Arkansas Grain Cooperative, 
which shared soybeans with neigh-
boring soybean processing plant in 
Stuttgart. Shortly thereafter, Riceland 
Foods became the official name for the 
cooperative, 
which 
would 
remain 
headquartered in Stuttgart. 
Today, Arkansas is the Nation’s lead-
ing rice producer, and Riceland has 
grown into the world’s largest miller 
and marketer of rice, as well as one of 
the Mid-South’s major soybean proc-
essors. 
Riceland 
has 
its 
own 
signature 
brands for home cooking and is also a 
major industrial supplier for compa-
nies such as Anheuser-Busch, General 
Mills, Gerber, and Kellogg’s. They also 
supply to the food service industry na-
tionwide. 
The rice the cooperative’s farmers 
grow is turned into products that reach 
consumers in more than 75 countries in 
North 
America, 
Central 
America, 
South America, the Caribbean, Europe, 
Africa, and the Middle East. 
At a recent celebration to mark 
Riceland’s 100th anniversary, chairman 
of the board Roger Pohlner spotlighted 
the cooperative’s greatest assets: its 
members 
and 
employees. 
He 
told 
attendees, 
‘‘Our 
founding 
members 
knew we were stronger together.’’ The 
cooperative’s 100 years of success is 
evidence of just how true that state-
ment is. 
I congratulate Riceland for reaching 
this historic milestone and wish them 
many more centuries of success.∑

TRIBUTE TO JULIA RITA URSONE 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, today, I rise to recognize Mrs. 
Julia ‘‘Julie’’ Rita Ursone, a longtime 
Connecticut resident who turns 100 on 
January 8, 2022. 
Born in Providence, RI, Mrs. Ursone 
was the child of Italian immigrants 
who became U.S. citizens. She moved 
to Stamford, CT, in 1947, where she has 
lived ever since. 
Mrs. Ursone grew up during the Great 
Depression 
and 
readily 
supported 
American efforts during World War II 
through factory work. 
To this day, she still lives in the 
house she built in 1951 with her late 
husband, who served in World War II 
and was an active member of their 
community. Passionate about doing 
her part in support of our Nation, Mrs. 
Ursone remains an active voter. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating Mrs. Julia Ursone, her 
son Lou, and the rest of her family on 
this milestone of her 100th birthday.∑

outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize a family-owned 
small business, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q of 
Bowling Green, KY, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
Kaye and Phil Huffer purchased 
Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q in 1999. Smokey 
Pig Bar-B-Q’s founder, Ned ‘‘Smokey’’ 
Nickerson, began serving up his signa-
ture Monroe County-style barbecue in 
1969 when he established the res-
taurant. To prepare this southern Ken-
tucky staple, the meat is prepared with 
no spices before being smoked over 
hickory wood. The hickory-smoked 
meat has a distinct flavor and is served 
with a vinegar-based sauce. Before his 
family bought the business, Phil regu-
larly made the 100-mile round trip from 
Bowling Green to his hometown to pur-
chase Monroe County-style barbecue. 
Noticing the absence of this particular 
style of barbecue in Warren County, 
Kaye and Phil decided to run a bar-
becue restaurant. They bought Smokey 
Pig Bar-B-Q, welcoming their first cus-
tomers in March 1999. 
More than 20 years later, Kaye and 
Phil continue to serve up some of the 
best barbecue in Bowling Green. Folks 
drive from all over the Commonwealth 
to enjoy their delicious cuisine and 
family-friendly hospitality. Kaye and 
Phil’s care and attention to detail are 
evident in every aspect of Smokey Pig 
Bar-B-Q’s restaurant and catering busi-
ness. Even the charcoal is made on 
site, using hickory wood from local 
sawmills. Their son Scott has also 
joined his parents in dedicating himself 
to the restaurant’s continued success. 
Together, Kaye and Phil seek to give 
back to their community in any way 
possible. Through Smokey Pig Bar-B- 
Q, Kaye and Phil regularly support 
community 
organizations, 
including 
Norton Children’s Hospital in Louis-
ville, KY. When their son, Matthew, 
was born preterm, they turned to the 
Children’s Hospital for support. Now, 
Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q is a longtime sup-
porter of the hospital, supporting their 
mission to continue helping children 
overcome health challenges. 
Over the years, Smokey Pig Bar-B- 
Q’s unique cuisine has been profiled by 
local and national media. It is cur-
rently rated as TripAdvisor’s No. 1 
Quick Bites in Bowling Green, and 
Grubwire named it the best restaurant 
in Bowling Green in 2019. Additionally, 
the Kentucky Pork Producers Associa-
tion honored Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q as 
the 2018 Pork Restaurant of the Year. 
For more than a decade, locals have 
voted Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q as ‘‘Best of 
Bowling Green’’ in BG Daily News’s an-
nual readers’ choice awards. The res-
taurant was also featured in the Food 
Network’s ‘‘Feasting on Asphalt’’ se-
ries hosted by Alton Brown. 
Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q is a remarkable 
example of how hard work and inge-
nuity can turn a dream into reality. 
Small businesses like Smokey Pig Bar- 
B-Q form the heart of towns across 
Kentucky and regularly step up to sup-
port their communities. Congratula-
tions to Phil, Kaye, and the entire 
Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q team. I wish them 
the best of luck and look forward to 
watching their continued growth and 
success in Kentucky.∑

By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mr. WICKER): 
S. 3340. A bill to establish a competi-
tive grant program to provide assist-
ance to support small businesses and 
business district revitalization in low- 
income, rural, and minority commu-
nities, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Revitalizing 
Small and Local Businesses Act, which 
I introduced today. 
Even before the onset of the COVID– 
19 pandemic, historic underinvestment 
in certain communities left their small 
businesses and business districts more 
vulnerable to economic shocks and 
limited economic opportunities. 
Main Street programs and business 
district organizations have played an 
important role in supporting busi-
nesses through the economic crisis and 
will continue to play a critical role in 
supporting a strong, inclusive recov-
ery. While many communities need 
place-based supportive services tai-
lored to their unique needs, Federal in-
vestments have not meaningfully sup-
ported these entities. 
As we work to build back better, we 
have an opportunity to improve equi-
table access to economic development 
resources by leveraging the expertise of 
nonprofit partners with deep connec-
tions to small businesses and the orga-
nizations that serve them. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill together with Senator WICKER 
to create a new $250 million Economic 
Development 
Administration 
grant 
program to support place-based sup-
portive services to provide on-the- 
ground assistance in both urban and 
rural communities. 
This bill would strategically and effi-
ciently deploy funding to support the 
vital work of local programs to revi-
talize small businesses and business 
districts as these communities, par-
ticularly low-income, rural, and minor-
ity communities, seek to recover from 
the devastating economic effects of the 
pandemic. 
It would support job retention and 
creation opportunities as well as de-
liver 
vital 
technical 
assistance 
to 
small businesses. 
I thank Senator WICKER for coleading 
this bill with me, and I hope our col-
leagues will join us in support of this 
bill to empower place-based entities to 
respond to economic recovery needs 
through locally tailored solutions.

S. RES. 473 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the signatories to the Revitalized 
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict 
in the Republic of South Sudan, signed on 
September 12, 2018, have delayed implemen-
tation, leading to continued conflict and in-
stability in South Sudan; 
(2) despite years of fighting, 2 peace agree-
ments, punitive actions by the international 
community, and widespread suffering among 
civilian populations, the leaders of South 
Sudan have failed to build sustainable peace; 
(3) the United Nations arms embargo on 
South Sudan, most recently extended by 1 
year to May 31, 2022, through United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 2577 (2021), is a 
necessary act by the international commu-
nity to stem the illicit transfer and desta-
bilizing accumulation and misuse of small 
arms and light weapons in perpetuation of 
the conflict in South Sudan; 
(4) the United States should call on other 
member states of the United Nations to re-
double efforts to enforce the United Nations 
arms embargo on South Sudan; and 
(5) the United States, through the United 
States Mission to the United Nations, should 
use its voice and vote in the United Nations 
Security Council in favor of maintaining the 
United Nations arms embargo on South 
Sudan until— 
(A) the Revitalized Agreement on the Res-
olution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan is fully implemented; or 
(B) credible, fair, and transparent demo-
cratic elections are held in South Sudan.

PARTY OF CHINA PROVE THAT

TIMIDATION AND FULLY INVES-

ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FORMER 
VICE PREMIER ZHANG GAOLI 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Ms. LUMMIS, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. 
HAWLEY, and Mr. CRUZ) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations.: 
S. RES. 474 
Whereas, as a decorated professional tennis 
player, a 3-time Olympian, and the number 1 
doubles player in 2014 as ranked by the Wom-
en’s Tennis Association, Peng Shuai is one of 
the most recognizable athletes from the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, on November 2, 2021, Peng Shuai 
publicly accused former Vice Premier of the 
People’s Republic of China Zhang Gaoli of 
sexual assault; 
Whereas Peng Shuai was immediately 
censored by the Communist Party of China 
and physically removed from public view; 
Whereas searches for Peng Shuai were 
blocked on social media platforms accessible 
from the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, for more than 2 weeks, the inter-
national athletic community, led by the 
Women’s Tennis Association, demanded that 
the Communist Party of China reveal the lo-
cation and health status of Peng Shuai and 
fully investigate the allegations against 
former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli; 
Whereas the state media of the People’s 
Republic of China released an email alleg-
edly from Peng Shuai to the Women’s Tennis 
Association in which Peng Shuai withdrew 
her allegations of sexual assault and claimed 
she was not missing; 
Whereas the President of the Women’s 
Tennis Association Steve Simon stated that 
the email raised more concerns as to the 
safety and whereabouts of Peng Shuai; 
Whereas, after immense international pub-
lic outcry over the disappearance of Peng 
Shuai, Peng Shuai re-emerged at various 
structured public events in the People’s Re-
public of China and participated in staged 
video calls with the International Olympic 
Committee; 
Whereas, on December 1, 2021, the Women’s 
Tennis Association announced that it would 
halt all tournaments in the People’s Repub-
lic of China, including Hong Kong, because 
the Association is not satisfied that Peng 
Shuai is safe; 
Whereas Simon stated that the Women’s 
Tennis Association would willingly cut off 
one of its largest business partners until the 
health and safety of Peng Shuai was clari-
fied, despite knowing the decision could cost 
the Women’s Tennis Association hundreds of 
millions of dollars in future revenue; 
Whereas Simon stated, ‘‘Chinese officials 
have been provided the opportunity to cease 
this censorship, verifiably prove that Peng is 
free and able to speak without interference 
or intimidation, and investigate the allega-
tion of sexual assault in a full, fair and 
transparent 
manner. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
leadership in China has not addressed this 
very serious issue in any credible way. While 
we now know where Peng is, I have serious 
doubts that she is free, safe and not subject 
to censorship, coercion and intimidation.’’; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee will host the 2022 Winter Olympic 
Games in Beijing, People’s Republic of 
China; 
Whereas the actions of the Communist 
Party of China in silencing Peng Shuai call 
into question the safety of other athletes 
competing in the 2022 Winter Olympic 
Games; and 
Whereas the actions against Peng Shuai 
and other flagrant human rights abuses, such 
as the genocide of predominantly Muslim 
Uyghurs, committed by the Communist 
Party of China are inconsistent with Olym-
pic values and the integrity of sport: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) applauds the actions of the Women’s 
Tennis Association— 
(A) to seek the security and safety of Peng 
Shuai; and 
(B) to hold the Communist Party of China 
accountable for its authoritarian censorship 
of Peng Shuai;

THE CELEBRATION OF ‘‘HUMAN 
RIGHTS DAY’’ 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. 
TILLIS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.: 
S. RES. 475 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, adopted by the United Na-
tions on December 10, 1948, represents the 
first comprehensive agreement among coun-
tries as to the specific rights and freedoms of 
all human beings; 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights upholds the basic principles of

stitution of the United States and the Bill of

Whereas awareness of human rights— 
(1) is essential to the realization of funda-
mental freedoms; 
(2) promotes equality; 
(3) contributes to preventing conflict and 
human rights violations; and 
(4) enhances participation in democratic 
processes; 
Whereas Congress has a proud history of 
promoting human rights that are inter-
nationally recognized; and 
Whereas December 10 of each year is cele-
brated around the world as ‘‘Human Rights 
Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
designates 
December 
10, 
2021, 
as 
‘‘Human Rights Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the 73rd anniversary of the

(4) supports the right of human rights de-
fenders all over the world to promote the

(A) to observe Human Rights Day; and 
(B) to continue a commitment to uphold-

SENATE RESOLUTION 476—DESIG-
NATING DECEMBER 18, 2021, AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
WREATHS 
ACROSS 
AMERICA DAY’’ 
Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. 
KING) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 476 
Whereas 30 years before the date of adop-
tion of this resolution, the Wreaths Across 
America project began with an annual tradi-
tion that occurs in December, of donating, 
transporting, and placing 5,000 Maine balsam 
fir veterans’ remembrance wreaths on the 
graves of the fallen heroes buried at Arling-
ton National Cemetery; 
Whereas, in the 30 years preceding the date 
of adoption of this resolution, more than 
12,000,000 wreaths have been sent to various 
locations, including national cemeteries and 
veterans’ memorials in every State and over-
seas; 
Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across 
America project, to ‘‘Remember, Honor, and 
Teach’’, is carried out in part by coordi-
nating wreath-laying ceremonies in all 50 
States and overseas, including at— 
(1) Arlington National Cemetery; 
(2) veterans cemeteries; and 
(3) other memorial locations; 
Whereas the Wreaths Across America 
project carries out a week-long veteran’s pa-
rade between Maine and Virginia, stopping 
along the way to spread a message about the 
importance of— 
(1) remembering the fallen heroes of the 
United States; 
(2) honoring those who serve; and 
(3) teaching the next generation of children 
about the service and sacrifices made by our 
veterans and their families to preserve free-
doms enjoyed by all in the United States; 
Whereas, in 2020, despite the challenges 
posed by the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, 
approximately 1,750,000 veterans’ remem-
brance wreaths were delivered to 2,557 loca-
tions across the United States and overseas; 
Whereas, in December 2021, the tradition of 
escorting tractor-trailers filled with donated 
wreaths from Harrington, Maine, to Arling-
ton National Cemetery will be continued 
by— 
(1) the Patriot Guard Riders; and 
(2) other patriotic escort units, including— 
(A) motorcycle units; 
(B) law enforcement units; and 
(C) first responder units; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals volunteer each December to help lay 
veterans’ wreaths; 
Whereas the trucking industry in the 
United States will continue to support the 
Wreaths Across America project by pro-
viding drivers, equipment, and related serv-
ices to assist in the transportation of 
wreaths across the United States to more 
than 2861 locations; 
Whereas the Senate designated December 
19, 2020, as ‘‘Wreaths Across America Day’’; 
and 
Whereas, on December 18, 2021, the Wreaths 
Across America project will continue the 
proud legacy of bringing veterans’ wreaths 
to Arlington National Cemetery: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates December 18, 2021, as ‘‘Na-
tional Wreaths Across America Day’’; 
(2) honors— 
(A) the Wreaths Across America project;

RECOGNIZING ANTIOCH 
MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
from the 24th district of the great state of Flor-
ida, I rise today to recognize Antioch Mis-
sionary Baptist Church as they celebrate and 
dedicate the completion of their new church 
building and campus, the ‘‘Dwelling Place.’’ 
Founded in 1957, Antioch opened the doors 
of its first church building in 1961. Because of 
the growing congregation, construction of a 
larger building was necessary and began in 
1973 and was completed in 1985. Antioch’s 
membership continued to increase requiring 
the construction of a 2,000–seat sanctuary 
and administrative building which was com-
pleted in 1998. 
In 1991, Pastor Arthur Jackson, III, became 
Senior Pastor of Antioch Missionary Baptist 
Church. Under his leadership, ‘‘20/20 Vision’’ 
a capital stewardship campaign was launched. 
‘‘20/20 Vision,’’ a five-year plan was initiated in 
an effort to accommodate the growing mem-
bership by constructing a larger worship cen-
ter, the ‘‘Dwelling Place.’’ The ‘‘Dwelling 
Place’’ includes a 3,000-seat worship center 
and adds 56,000 square feet to the campus. 
The completion of construction of this new 
building is a great feat to commemorate, as 
the congregation has been able to persevere 
through such difficult times during the Corona 
virus pandemic. After a year and a half of vir-
tual services, Antioch’s in-person services will 
resume in the new sanctuary. The ‘‘Dwelling 
Place’’ will make Antioch one of the largest 
churches in South Florida. 
Under the leadership of Pastor Arthur Jack-
son, III, the church has been able to fulfill their 
‘‘20/20 Vision’’ of building a campus that will 
glorify God throughout the entire process, ex-
pand and enhance the ministry and programs 
designed to advance God’s Kingdom, and 
build in a manner which good stewardship will 
be exemplified. 
Reverend Arthur Jackson, III has served as 
Senior Pastor/Teacher of the Antioch Mis-
sionary Baptist Church, since March 8, 1991. 
A native of South Florida, Pastor Jackson is 
the son of Reverend and Mrs. Arthur Jackson, 
Jr. Pastor Jackson was licensed as a Minister 
on October 9, 1988, at the New Shiloh Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Miami, Florida where 
he served as an Associate Minister under the 
leadership of his father, Rev. Arthur Jackson, 
Jr. 
A man of great character, integrity, wisdom, 
and counsel, Pastor Jackson’s consistent obe-
dience to God has taken the Antioch con-
gregation from the ‘‘Faithful Fifty’’ to a blos-
soming ministry of over 7,000 that continues 
to grow at record pace. 
The Antioch Missionary Baptist Church is a 
Word-centered ministry existing to evangelize 
the lost, to equip and empower God’s people, 
and to lead them to eternal salvation in Christ 
Jesus. 
Antioch Missionary Baptist Church has two 
locations in South Florida with campuses in 
Miami Gardens and Fort Lauderdale. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues and 
all Americans to please join me in recognizing 
the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church for its 
contributions and commitment to the citizens 
of our community, state and country.

HONORING 
THE 
BELLEVILLE 
FOOTBALL TEAM 2021 MHSAA DI-
VISION I FOOTBALL CHAMPIONS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Belleville Football 
Team, the victors of the 2021 MHSAA Division 
1 Football State Championship. This team’s 
tremendous accomplishment is worthy of com-
mendation. 
On November 27, 2021, the Belleville Tigers 
and Rochester Adams Highlanders met at 
Ford Field in Detroit for the Division 1 cham-
pionship game. After being up 21–20 at the 
half, the Belleville Tigers quickly established a 
divisive lead in the third quarter. In a stunning 
victory, the Belleville Tigers won the state 
championship and defeated Rochester Adams 
with a score of 55–33. 
In a season that was as challenging as it 
was rewarding, the Tigers’ tireless dedication 
to football and commitment to teamwork paid 
off when they became state champions for the 
first time in school history. These players 
proved that with hard work and confidence in 
one’s teammates, there is no obstacle that is 
too big to overcome. The Belleville Tigers 
have made our community proud, and we are 
all excited to celebrate this achievement 
alongside them. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in honoring the Belleville Football 
Team as they celebrate winning the 2021 
state championship. Please join me in con-
gratulating the Tigers on a fantastic victory 
and wishing them the best of luck in the years 
ahead. Go Tigers.

HONORING THE SPRING GROVE 
GIRLS’ VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Spring Grove Area High 
School girls’ volleyball team for winning the 
PIAA Class 3A volleyball championship last 
month, with a 3–1 victory over Hampton. 
Spring Grove’s path to the championship 
was not always certain, as they faced difficult 
competition in the state semifinals and quar-
terfinals. Thanks to their passion and hard 
work, the team rose to the challenges and 
emerged victorious, becoming state cham-
pions, and finishing out the season with a 
nearly undefeated record. Their win marks the 
first time that Spring Grove Area School Dis-
trict has ever won a state championship in 
volleyball and just the second time that the 
district has won a state championship. This is 
an incredible achievement and one of which 
the players, their parents, and head coach, Liz 
Zeigler, should be enormously proud. 
Congratulations to the team for this accom-
plishment and I wish the graduating seniors 
the best of luck in their future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY OF MOTHER PEARLIE MAE 
STRANGE 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and legacy of 
Mother Pearlie Mae Strange, a beloved moth-
er, grandmother, great grandmother, friend, 
devout Christian, and prayer warrior. 
Mother Strange was born on April 1, 1934 
in Miami, Florida to the James and Arizona 
Joseph. Her upbringing was grounded by lov-
ing, hardworking parents, and a strong foun-
dation in the home which was built upon Mat-
hews 19:19, ‘‘Honor thy father and thy moth-
er,’’ and the old saying, ‘‘A family that prays 
together stays together.’’ As the second of 
eleven siblings she assumed a nurturing and 
motherly role at an early age, and she used 
that same unselfish love from her parents and 
the strong foundation upon which her values 
were built to guide her in carrying out those 
roles. 
By Divine Providence, Mother Strange met 
and later married the love of her life, Rev-

W.L. Strange, Jr., she transferred her mem-
bership to Mt. Calvary Missionary Baptist 
Church where, as an avid prayer warrior, she 
faithfully served in the Prayer Line Ministry 
and in the capacity of President of the Moth-
er’s Board until her passing. 
Mother Strange matriculated through the 
Miami-Dade County Public School System. In 
her later years, after fulfilling the command to 
‘‘train up a child . . .’’, she pursued a per-
sonal lifelong dream of becoming a Beau-
tician. She enrolled in the Cosmetology Pro-
gram at Miami Jackson Technical School and 
later obtained her Certificate as a Licensed 
Florida Cosmetologist in 1982. God blessed 
the works of her hands as she pursued her 
passion in the beauty industry by working at 
several salons, including the Theatrical Beauty 
Salon under the tutelage of the late Mrs. Ella 
Moncur. Mother Strange fulfilled her lifelong 
dream and established her own home-based 
salon. 
Mother Pearlie Mae Strange was preceded 
in death by her husband, parents, four chil-
dren, two grandsons, and four brothers. She 
leaves precious memories to be cherished by 
her sons: Rev. Billy W.L. Strange, Jr., 
Mareiece Strange (Earnestina), Larry Strange 
and 
Donald 
Strange; 
daughters 
Agnes 
Strange (Andy), Marva Bates (Michael), and 
Tonia Dudley (Billy); devoted sisters Luella 
Page, Francis Williams and Genice Scott; 
dedicated brothers Glenroy Joseph, Terry Jo-
seph, Sr. (Diana) and Ernest Davis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues and 
all Americans to please join me in honoring 
the late Mother Pearlie Mae Strange for her 
untiring love and dedication to her family and 
her community, and for her strong walk in 
Christian faith as she has dedicated her life to 
helping others.

LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. SHARON 
BAILEY 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and remember the life of Dr. Sharon 
Bailey. 
Dr. Bailey, a proud Coloradan, Princeton 
graduate, and accomplished leader, dedicated 
her life to guaranteeing students of color, 
teachers, and administrators in Colorado and 
across the nation had the means necessary to 
both achieve and provide a high quality of 
education. She is survived by her husband 
and my friend, John, her three sons, five 
grandchildren, and a generation forever im-
pacted by her influence. 
Dr. Bailey was a passionate and dedicated 
leader, and a pivotal force on the Denver Pub-
lic School Board to ensure quality education 
for all. 
Throughout her life she championed the 
need for a deeper understanding of the experi-
ences of the Black community in education 
and worked to ensure that all children are 
given the same opportunity to succeed. 
The accomplishments of her life in service 
will continue to be felt throughout the state of 
Colorado for years to come, and her legacy 
will not soon be forgotten. 
My thoughts and prayers are with John and 
all of Dr. Bailey’s family and friends. As we 
mourn her passing, we will remember her life 
and be inspired by her wisdom and tenacity.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. JOSEPH 
K. DOWLEY 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, our Ways and 
Means family mourns the passing of Joseph 
K. Dowley. Joe was the Committee’s Chief 
Counsel during the 1980s, who left us an im-
portant legacy in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 
for which he did so much to enact into law. 
Joe became Ways and Means Chief Coun-
sel in 1984 after earning undergraduate and 
law degrees from Georgetown University, 
Army service in Vietnam, and employment as 
administrative assistant to my friend, former 
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski. He was a deft 
tax technician who not only knew what was 
broken, but also how to fix it. He never forgot 
that lawmaking is the art of the possible, and 
was ready when Chairman Rostenkowski ac-
cepted President Ronald Reagan’s challenge 
to undertake comprehensive tax reform. His 
patient but relentless pursuit of that lofty goal 
helped create the political alchemy that made 
an initially improbable goal inevitable. 
Success didn’t come quickly or easily. As 
with any major piece of legislation, the proc-
ess was a combination of the tense and the 
tedious. My colleagues writing the act recall it 
as a challenging time when long hours some-
times resulted in short tempers. But Joe’s 
calm combination of competence and con-
fidence kept the legislative train moving to-
ward the inevitable compromises that signal 
success. 
As the current Chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee, I now more deeply appre-
ciate the role he played as an exemplary staff-
er, enabling those of us elected to enact legis-
lation to do so by drawing the map that trans-
lated an idea into a legislative proposal that 
could become a workable law. 
After leaving Capitol Hill, Joe continued to 
be an active member of Washington’s tax 
community. His service to Congress wasn’t 
easy, and there are few who have done it as 
well. He remains a role model for doing seri-
ous business in a humane way, and we will 
miss him. We join his wife Carol and his entire 
family in mourning his passing.

REMEMBERING FRED HIATT 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay my respects to Fred Hiatt, the longtime 
editorial page editor of the Washington Post 
whose authoritative and thoughtful voice on 
thousands of issues of public policy helped to 
strengthen our democracy. Mr. Hiatt, a 40- 
year veteran of the Post and a three-time Pul-
itzer Prize finalist, oversaw the opinion page 
and introduced the Post’s audience to dozens 
of talented writers. An advocate of civil rights, 
democracy, human rights, and equality of op-
portunity, his thousands of unsigned editorials 
influenced public opinion and policy makers, 
including me. His forceful demand for justice 
when Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was 
murdered will never be forgotten. He once 
said he believed there will always be a market 
for ‘‘really good, serious, readable, thoughtful, 
unpurchased, non-yelling opinion,’’ and pro-
vided it daily on the Post’s pages. I express 
my condolences to his wife Margaret Shapiro, 
and his children Alexandra, Joseph and Na-
thaniel, and his many friends and colleagues. 
His was a purposeful and dynamic life, and he 
will be missed.

HONORING MARCEL RIVAS 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
from the 24th Congressional District of the 
great State of Florida, it is my honor to rise to 
honor Marcel Rivas for his extraordinary work 
in adoption, permanency, and child welfare. 
It was truly my privilege to nominate him for 
the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Insti-
tute’s Angel in Adoption award. Adoption gives 
hopeful parents an opportunity to raise a child 
they wouldn’t have otherwise. It also provides 
children with loving families and hope for the 
future. 
Over the course of his 27-year career as a 
child welfare professional, which includes 21 
years at the Children’s Home Society of Flor-
ida, Marcel has helped more than 3,000 chil-
dren find their forever families. He also 
streamlined countywide systems to expedite 
permanency via adoptions and worked with 
the child welfare system of care partners, ad-
vocating locally and statewide for, and on be-
half of, adoptive families to ensure their voices 
are valued and heard. 
I applaud him for the particular time and at-
tention that he has devoted to children with 
special needs and minority populations, who 
unfortunately are harder to place, but also 
have the greatest need for a safe and secure 
home environment. 
At Citrus Family Care Network, he oversees 
the education department, as well as the larg-
est Transitioning Youth Services Department 
in Florida, serving hundreds of young adults, 
ages 18 to 23, who have aged out of foster 
care. 
This is a critical and pivotal point in these 
young lives, and as a former educator and 
someone who has advocated on behalf of chil-
dren throughout my entire career. I am grate-
ful that they have Marcel to help guide them 
to reach their full potential. 
I thank Marcel Rivas for his hard work, dedi-
cation and all of the joy that he has helped 
bring to thousands of families. He truly is an 
angel. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, my 
constituents of the 24th Congressional District 
of the great State of Florida, the residents of 
Miami-Dade and all Americans to please join 
me in celebrating Marcel Rivas’ remarkable 
achievements.

NATIONAL PULSE MEMORIAL 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 7, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (S. 1605). 
The annual defense authorization bill is im-
portant legislation that guides Department of 
Defense policy and provides a framework for 
our Armed Forces for the year ahead. The 
House and Senate have worked together to 
craft this bipartisan piece of legislation that 
makes some significant policy changes im-
pacting our service members and their fami-
lies. 
S. 1605 makes historic and sweeping 
changes to the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice to combat sexual assault in the military by 
removing immediate Commanders from the 
decision-making chain regarding the prosecu-
tion of crimes like rape and sexual assault. As 
the Chair of the House Appropriations Sub-
committee on Defense, our subcommittee has 
worked to ensure the Department has had the 
proper resources to combat sexual assault 
and violence in the military and to support vic-
tims. However, the pervasive nature of this so-
cietal problem has plagued our military for too 
long and it is time to make significant changes 
to the way these crimes are adjudicated. S. 
1605 takes this first step, and I am proud of 
the bipartisan and bicameral work that has 
been done to begin to address this. 
S. 1605 supports our men and women in 
uniform and their families by authorizing a 
well-deserved 2.7 percent pay increase. It also 
contains several important provisions to pro-
mote inclusion and diversity within our Armed 
Forces including authorizing additional support 
for Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities. The composition of America’s Armed 
Forces and its leadership must reflect the in-
creasing diversity of our society and this legis-
lation promotes diversity and inclusion within 
the Services. 
As our planet continues to face the dev-
astating impacts of climate change, it is critical 
that the Department of Defense act. Combat-
ting climate change isn’t about engaging in so-
cial politics, it is a matter of national security. 
The Department has too many installations 
that are susceptible to extreme weather 
events, which leads to too many days when 
our troops cannot train. And, as the largest 
procurer of energy in the federal government, 
the Department must become more energy ef-
ficient. S. 1605 makes key investments and 
authorizes specific actions to address the 
threat climate change poses to our national 
security and bolster energy resiliency across 
the Department of Defense. Additionally, S. 
1605 addresses the long-term impacts of 
PFAS/PFOA contamination in our communities 
surrounding military installations. The legisla-
tion creates a Department Task Force on 
PFAS to spearhead DoD’s response, as well 
as authorizes $517 million above the Presi-
dent’s Budget Request for PFAS remediation 
projects. 
Additionally, this legislation includes Depart-
ment of State Authorizations that bolsters our 
essential diplomatic authorities to emphasize 
the whole of government approach to our na-
tional security. This is critically important in the 
wake of the serious damage caused to the 
Department of State and our international dip-
lomatic efforts by the Trump administration. I 
commend the Biden administration’s efforts to 
refocus on diplomacy, on reengaging in our al-
liances, and on rebuilding the State Depart-
ment. 
While I am supporting this legislation and 
many of the good provisions contained in it, 
this bill does have areas that I think could 
have been greatly improved. First, this legisla-
tion does not support the Biden administra-
tion’s efforts to finally close the detention facil-
ity at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The detention 
facility has been a stain on our global reputa-
tion and a detriment to our national security 
for two decades. I included language in the 
Fiscal Year 2022 Defense Appropriations Act 
that would allow for the closure of the facility, 
so I am deeply disappointed to see existing 
language on Guantanamo Bay maintained in 
S. 1605. 
Second, I am disappointed that the Con-
gress continues to avoid our responsibility to 
sunset existing Authorizations of Use of Mili-
tary Force (AUMF). The 2001 and 2002 
AUMF’s are out of date and have been 
stretched and reinterpreted by four separate 
administrations. It is long past time for Con-
gress to have a comprehensive discussion on 
our Constitutional responsibility to authorize 
force. That includes having a frank discussion 
on how drones are utilized by the military and 
the Intelligence Community. If a new AUMF is 
necessary, then Congress needs to have the 
courage to have that debate in public and 
come to a decision. 
Last, while S. 1605 contains critically impor-
tant policy provisions that support our future 
national security needs, I believe that Con-
gress must be a good steward of taxpayer dol-
lars. That is why I continue to be supportive of 
the topline funding number in President 
Biden’s FY22 budget request for the Depart-
ment of Defense and the number contained in 
the Fiscal Year 2022 Defense Appropriations 
Act produced by the House of Representa-
tives. While drafting the defense appropria-
tions act this past summer, the committee had 
serious conversations and made tough, but 
necessary, decisions regarding our national 
security budget. The defense appropriations 
bill that the House produced reflects a bal-
anced approach in appropriately funding our 
national security while allowing for necessary 
increases in domestic priorities in support of 
the American people here at home. We also 
need to have an honest discussion about hav-
ing a new round of Base Realignment and 
Closure (BRAC) in line with the Department of 
Defense’s recommendations. A new BRAC 
round could save taxpayers billions of dollars 
that could be better spent elsewhere. 
While the authorizers have shared their 
ideas on how to fund the military in this legis-
lation, it is the Appropriations Committee that 
will ultimately decide how to fund our Armed 
Forces. As the FY22 appropriations process 
moves forward, I will continue to work with my 
colleagues to ensure that the Department of 
Defense is funded responsibly and that the in-
terests of American people are protected. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a yes vote on this 
legislation. 
EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO ANN 
LIMJOCO FOR TWENTY YEARS 
OF SERVICE 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my sincere thanks and ap-
preciation to Ann Limjoco, a dedicated public 
servant who spent twenty years on my staff 
assisting constituents of the 9th Congressional 
District of Illinois. Ann will be starting a new 
chapter in the new year, and I wish her suc-
cess and happiness moving forward. 
Ann served many years as the Suburban 
Director on my district staff. Overseeing my 
suburban operations, Ann worked closely with 
municipalities from Evanston to Arlington 
Heights and everywhere in between. She built 
strong relationships with elected officials at all 
levels of government and was a well-known 
face at events throughout the district. When 
municipalities needed federal assistance or 
input, they knew that Ann was a reliable ally 
and an open door. 
Ann regularly worked with other members of 
my staff to organize outreach events through-
out the 9th District. She played an instru-
mental role in carrying out dozens of hiring 
events, community resource fairs, municipal 
information events, and many others. Ann 
often spoke on my behalf, representing me 
with professionalism and competence. 
Ann was my liaison to the O’Hare Noise 
Compatibility Commission (ONCC), an organi-
zation that spent many years working to ad-
dress and alleviate the negative impacts of 
O’Hare Airport on surrounding suburbs. She 
was a true expert in this field and I relied on 
her for up-to-date information on an issue that 
many of my constituents deal with day in and 
day out. 
In addition to outreach and relationship 
building efforts, Ann was a vigorous advocate 
for constituents needing assistance with prob-
lems related to taxes, immigration, the postal 
service, and a host of other issues. All told, 
she handled over three thousand constituent 
cases, and I have no doubt that her hard work 
changed many lives for the better. Ann also 
helped run an excellent intern program and 
helped train and mentor many young people 
through this program. 
My staff and I will undoubtedly feel the loss 
of Ann’s deep knowledge and many years of 
experience. I have no doubt that Ann will suc-
ceed at whatever she sets her mind to.

humanitarian work and uplifting others. She 
became one of the first women ever to work 
in the United States federal government, work-
ing as a recording clerk in the United States 
Patent Office. She would go on to become an 
advocate for public education and in 1853 be-
came 
involved 
in 
helping 
the 
City 
of 
Bordentown establish the first ever public 
school in New Jersey. Perhaps, though, she 
remains best known for her work as a nurse 
during the Civil War; learning from those expe-
riences to found the American Red Cross in 
1881. 
I am incredibly proud of the work the 
Bordentown Historical Society is doing to pre-
serve the original Clara Barton schoolhouse, 
that 
remains 
standing 
in 
downtown 
Bordentown, and her legacy as an American 
pioneer. 
As the Bordentown Historical Society pre-

COMMEMORATING THE 90TH 
BIRTHDAY OF DR. ENID PINKNEY 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
from the 24th district of the great state of Flor-
ida, I rise today to commemorate the 90th 
Birthday of Dr. Enid Pinkney. 
Whereas, Enid Curtis Pinkney was born Oc-
tober 15, 1931, in the city of Miami’s Overtown 
neighborhood. She is the third of four children 
born to Bahamian parents, Lenora and Henry 
Curtis. She graduated from the all-black Book-
er T. Washington High School in 1949 and 
went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree 
from Talladega College (Talladega, Alabama) 
in Social Science. She continued her edu-
cation and earned a Master of Science degree 
from Barry University (Miami, Florida) in Guid-
ance and Counseling and an Honorary Doc-
torate Degree in Humane Letters from St. 
Thomas 
University 
(Miami, 
Florida). 
Dr. 
Pinkney served on the Executive Board of the 
National Alumni Association of Talladega Col-
lege, has been inducted into the Talladega 
College Hall of Fame, and received the South-
ern Regional Outstanding Alumni award from 
the National Alumni of Talladega College. The 
Enid Curtis Pinkney Humanitarian Awards 
Luncheon was named in her honor by the 
Miami Talladega College Alumni Association; 
and 
Whereas, due to her civic involvement and 
knowledge as a historian, Dr. Pinkney was 
featured in Miami in Our Own Words, by the 
Miami Herald, Profiles of Miami by the Univer-
sity of Miami, and has been a columnist for 
The Miami Times. She wrote a chapter in Mi-
ami’s 
Historic 
Neighborhoods 
entitled 
‘‘Brownsville.’’ Dr. Pinkney conducted the Afri-
can American Research for Burials in the City 
Cemetery, 1896 through 1990. She produced 
the television program Resurrection: Blacks 
Buried in the City Cemetery for WPXM TV and 
a twelve-part series on Historical Perspectives 
of Brownsville for WLRN TV; and 
Whereas, Dr. Pinkney worked aggressively 
over the years to ensure that the role of Afri-
can Americans in Miami’s history is acknowl-
edged and preserved. She appeared in sev-
eral documentaries detailing Miami’s history 
including Golden Side of the Tracks, a film 
Documentary about ‘‘Overtown,’’ which was di-
rected by David Weintraub. More recently she 
appeared in a Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. doc-
umentary regarding his visits to Miami, Florida, 
produced by WLRN TV and directed by Mia 
Lorenzo. Dr. Pinkney also produced the docu-
mentary the Hampton House which aired on 
WLRN TV; and 
Whereas, Dr. Pinkney worked as a social 
worker from 1953 to 1955, after which she 
worked in the Dade County Public School 
System until she retired, in 1991, as Assistant 
Principal at South Miami Middle School. In the 
mid-1980s, she joined the Dade Heritage 
Trust historic preservation organization, and in 
1998 was elected the first black president of 
the Trust leading the community in saving the 
Miami Circle from demolition. She also served 
as the first African American president of Na-
tives of Dade. Under Dr. Pinkney’s leadership, 
the Virginia Key Beach Park Trust prevented 
the City of Miami from building an Ecotourist 
Resort on ‘‘Colored’’ Beach. Her strong faith in 
God led her to become a founding and charter 
member of The Church of The Open Door, 
(Congregational) United Church of Christ, 
where she served as its first clerk. Dr. Pinkney 
was a member of the Board of Directors of the 
Florida Conference of the United Church of 
Christ for two terms, and served on the Exec-
utive Council, the Board of Common Services, 
and General Ministries; and 
Whereas, Dr. Pinkney is a recipient of the 
‘‘Distinguished Alumni Award’’ from the Na-
tional Association for Equal Opportunity in 
Higher Education. She served as Founding 
President/CEO 
of 
The 
Historic 
Hampton 
House Community Trust, Inc. where she 
saved the Historic Hampton House Motel from 
demolition, and persuaded Miami Dade Coun-
ty to buy the building to restore it. Today, it is 
the only motel in Miami from the days of seg-
regation. Dr. Pinkney is now President Emer-
itus of the Historic Hampton House; and 
Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, FRED-
ERICA S. WILSON, a member of the United 
States House of Representatives, representing 
the 24th Congressional District of Florida, am 
proud to recognize Dr. Enid Pinkney on her 
90th birthday.

RECOGNIZING THE 13TH ANNUAL 
FAMILY 
CHRISTMAS 
EXTRAVA-
GANZA 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, on December 
18, 2021, Brevard County families, businesses 
and local community organizations will gather 
to celebrate the 13th Annual Family Christmas 
Extravaganza. 
Having become one of the largest Christ-
mas celebrations on the Space Coast, this 
year’s event will be bigger and better than 
ever, promising a place for family and friends 
to partake in a wide variety of holiday festivi-
ties to get them in the Christmas spirit. 
This year’s event will take place at Fred 
Poppe Regional Park in Palm Bay from 11:00 
a.m.–5:00 p.m. and will be completely free of 
charge thanks to over 60 local businesses and 
organizations. As a demonstration of love, The 
House, Eastwind Pentecostal, Victory in Christ 
Jesus, Elevation, Center of Love Church, 
Grace Bible, Jornada al Cielo, Church on the 
Rock, His Place Ministries, Christ is the An-
swer (CITA), Bay West, and Wings of Grace 
have all united to bring the 13th Annual Family 
Christmas Extravaganza to our City and Coun-
ty. 
Because of their generous contributions, 
families will be able to enjoy food galore, ride 
horses, and see live entertainment. This year’s 
Family Christmas Extravaganza will even fea-
ture God in a Box production by ANEW Life 
International, a 3 on 3 Basketball Tournament 
by Court Kingz, and an acrobatic show by 
Cirque Adventure. 
The House of Palm Bay, City of Palm Bay 
Parks and Recreation, along with several com-
munity business partners such as Thrifty Spe-
cialty Produce, Chick-Fil-A, Gator Automotive, 
Ben & Jerry’s, The Source, and Dignity Foods 
are just among the few names of many we 
must thank for providing the venue and re-
sources to make the celebration unforgettable. 
Senior Pastor Ken Delgado of the House at 
Palm Bay said in anticipation of the event, 
‘‘With today’s news being filled with division, 
contention and expressions of hatred, it is ex-
citing to see the City of Palm Bay, along with 
its businesses and citizens, create an event 
where love, joy and peace is expressed. The 
Family Christmas Extravaganza is the greatest 
expression that so many people yearn for and 
is what the angels proclaimed at the birth of 
Jesus saying, ‘Peace and good will towards all 
men.’ ’’ 
The City of Palm Bay issued a proclamation 
in support for this year’s celebration, pro-
claiming December 18, 2021, Family Christ-
mas Extravaganza Day. 
The spirit of the holidays is all about giving 
and spending time with loved ones. This 
year’s Extravaganza brings our community to-
gether to remind us of that. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting all 
those who are doing their part to spread the 
Christmas spirit this holiday season and those 
who have worked so hard to make the 13th 
Annual Family Christmas Extravaganza pos-

HONORING DR. ANUJ BHARGAVA 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Dr. Anuj Bhargava as Iowan of 
the Week. November is diabetes awareness 
month, and Dr. Bhargava has done more than 
bring awareness to diabetes, he has dedicated 
his life to finding a cure and fighting for those 
that have been impacted by diabetes. 
Dr. Bhargava is the founder of Iowa Diabe-
tes, an organization that has now been around 
for more than 14 years. Within the first few 
years, their research center started over 50 
studies and became a leading diabetes re-
search center in Iowa. As they started more 
trials and hired more staff members, it was 
clear that more office and patient care space 
was needed. As of today, they have started 
more than 100 diabetes studies and served 
more than 1,600 patients in Central Iowa. Dr. 
Bhargava believes that a comprehensive ap-
proach is required to change diabetes and that 
technology, education, and research should 
play a role in this change. Additionally, in 2017 
Iowa Diabetes launched Iowa Diabetes Portal, 
which is a free tool they provide patients to 
help them easily manage sugars, meds, labs, 
activity, and more. In 2019, they launched 
Iowa Diabetes Care. a non-traditional care 
management system. 
More than 300,000 Iowans have diabetes, 
and that number is only expected to grow. At 
Iowa Diabetes, it is Dr. Bhargava’s goal to im-
prove the lives of Iowans affected by diabetes 
through the services provided by their organi-
zation. Dr. Bhargava is hopeful that Iowa Dia-
betes and all that it offers can make an impact 
on the hundreds of thousands of people with 
diabetes in Iowa. 
I will always fight for organizations like Iowa 
Diabetes and leaders like Dr. Bhargava and 
continue to support them in Congress by pro-
moting legislation that will support our commu-
nities that need it the most. It is my pleasure 
to recognize Dr. Anuj Bhargava as Iowan of 
the Week.

CELEBRATING THE LATE MS. 
JOSEPHINE BAKER 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
from the 24th Congressional District of the 
great State of Florida, it is my honor to rise in 
celebration of the late Ms. Josephine Baker as 
she becomes the first black woman to rest in 
the Pantheon in Paris, France. 
It is truly a privilege to honor and recognize 
Ms. Baker for her tremendous work of break-
ing the boundaries of segregation. Ms. Baker 
was a performer like no other. She refused to 
sign contracts with venues that were seg-
regated. By refusing to perform in racially seg-
regated theaters, staying in the finest hotels 
and eating in the best restaurants, Josephine 
wanted to show that skin color did not imply 
differential treatment and was no obstacle to 
wealth and fame. 
In 1951, she convinced the Copa City Club, 
the epicenter of Miami Beach’s nightlife, to 
open its doors to all. Ms. Baker’s shows were 
a huge success and the beginning of a new 
social life for the communities of the area. 
Her boldness and sense of glamour reso-
nated with the new Art Deco movement with 
its equally revolutionary architecture inspired 
by bold and colorful geometric shapes. Art 
Deco was a perfect representation of the mod-
ern urban life and is now part of the heritage 
of Miami Beach. 
Ms. Baker believed in fighting for what’s 
right. During World War II, Josephine Baker 
joined the French Resistance hiding under-
ground fighters and Jews in the Chaˆteau des 
Milandes in the Pe´rigord region. She became 
a pilot for the French Forces Libres in Mo-
rocco and concealed information in her musi-
cal scores that she passed on to the Allies. 
She was awarded the Legion of Honor and 
the Me´daille de la Re´sistance, upon the Lib-
eration. 
Her humanist philosophy spilled over into 
her private life. Starting in 1953, Josephine 
Baker built a utopian family by adopting twelve 
children from all over the world, which gave 
people food for thought in the 50s and 60s. 
The Rainbow Tribe was the realization of the 
anti-racial, peaceful dream of Martin Luther 
King, Jr.’s universal brotherhood. 
Seventy years after breaking the rule of 
segregated audiences in Miami Beach clubs, 
Josephine Baker is the first black woman to 
be recognized as a great figure in the Pan-
theon in Paris, France. The Pantheon has be-
come a true symbol of the French Republic. 
This ’Temple of Humanity’ is now a mau-
soleum for illustrious figures of the Enlighten-
ment and for those who made their mark in 
the country’s history such as inventors, writers 
and Human Rights activists. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, my 
constituents of the 24th Congressional District 
of the great State of Florida, the residents of 
Miami-Dade and all Americans to please join 
me in celebrating Ms. Josephine Baker’s re-
markable achievements. 
74TH 
BIRTHDAY 
OF 
JIMMY 
LAI 
AND HIS IMPRISONMENT BY CHI-
NESE 
AUTHORITIES 
IN 
HONG 
KONG 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
Mr. Jimmy Lai, the renowned founder of Apple 
Daily and prominent supporter of democracy, 
turns 74 today. A brave Beijing critic and a de-
vout Catholic, Mr. Lai has been on the fore-
front of fighting for press freedom. Con-
sequently, he was taken into custody and de-
nied bail by Hong Kong authorities acting at 
the apparent behest of the Chinese Com-
munist Party more than a year ago. 
Under the so-called ‘‘national security law,’’ 
Beijing has been punishing anything it con-
siders remotely resembling the vague crimes 
of ‘‘secession,’’ ‘‘subversion,’’ ‘‘terrorism’’ and 
‘‘collusion with foreign forces’’ with penalties 
up to life imprisonment. According to Joanna 
Chiu, a former Hong Kong-based journalist 
who testified before the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission, international engagement 
including with the United Nations or foreign 
governments—can now be criminalized as 
‘‘collusion with foreign forces.’’ 
Despite deteriorating health and having to 
spend a second holiday season in a cold pris-
on cell since his arrest, Mr. Lai remains unbro-
ken. He wrote in a letter from prison in April 
2021, ‘‘A journalist’s responsibility [is] to up-
hold justice. The era is falling apart before us, 
and it is time for us to stand tall.’’ Indeed, he 
stands for something larger than himself. 
Lai’s commitment to press freedom and 
democratic principles began long before the 
national security law was passed. He has 
been an outspoken critic of Beijing’s control 
over Hong Kong and a high-profile supporter 
of the pro-democracy movement. After the 
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Lai be-
came an ardent critic of the Beijing govern-
ment, and left the retail industry where he 
made his fortune for media and politics. He 
founded Next Media and in 1995, launched 
Apple Daily, which became Hong Kong’s most 
prominent pro-democracy newspaper. 
For his work and unstoppable dedication to 
democratic values, Mr. Lai was just awarded 
the World Association of News Publishers’ 
highest honor for his sacrifice in the cause of 
press freedom. 
The Golden Pen of Freedom is the Associa-
tion’s annual award recognizing individuals or 
organizations that have made outstanding 
contributions in the defense and promotion of 
press freedom. We also need to remember 
that there are hundreds of other ‘‘Jimmy Lais’’ 
in Hong Kong and beyond, who are deter-
mined to stand for freedom of press. 
Indeed, at a hearing of the bipartisan Tom 
Lantos Human Rights Commission that I 
chaired on October 14 of this year, on the 
State of Civil and Political Rights in Hong 
Kong, we learned that Hong Kong reportedly 
has more journalists in jail per capita than any 
other place on earth. 
We cannot forget these imprisoned journal-
ists either, and we should say their names: 
Edmund Wan You-sing, Ryan Law, Cheung 
Kim Hung, Chan Pui-man, Lam Man Chung, 
Fung Wai Kong, Yeung Ching-kee, and 
Gwyneth Ho.

These brave journalists continue to be im-
prisoned, while others have been released on

We will continue to keep Jimmy in our pray-
ers and urge that he be released along with 
the other Hong Kong journalists and democ-
racy advocates unjustly imprisoned.

HONORING 
THE 
90TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF BENJAMIN V. GOODELL 
VFW POST 552 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Benjamin V. Goodell VFW 
Post 552 as it celebrates its 90th anniversary. 
This tremendous milestone is worthy of com-
mendation. 
On July 31, 1931, twenty members of the 
Lincoln Park community came together to es-
tablish VFW Post 552 in old Lafayette School. 
In the following years, the post quickly flour-
ished and changed locations to accommodate 
its expanding membership, especially in the 
aftermath of World War II. Post 552 was the 
fastest-growing post in the state, with peak 
membership of around 700 members by 1975. 
Throughout the years, Post 552 has cele-
brated many victories, held countless events, 
and provided invaluable support to our com-
munity’s devoted veterans. For nine decades, 
Post 552’s leadership has made a profound 
difference in Lincoln Park and Southeast 
Michigan. It played a critical role in estab-
lishing the local VA Hospitals, coordinating the 
annual Lincoln Park Memorial Day Parade, 
and sponsoring a number of efforts that have 
made the city a better place. Post 552 has 
earned a host of accolades and awards in rec-
ognition of these achievements, and I am 
proud that our community is home to such a 
dedicated and patriotic group. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in honoring Benjamin V. Goodell 
Post 552 on its 90th anniversary. Post 552 is 
a pillar of the community, and we are grateful 
for the important role it has played in veterans’ 
lives throughout the past nine decades. 
Please join me in celebrating Post 552 on this 
special occasion. We all are looking forward to 
celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2031.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
NICOLE 
MONTNA VAN VLECK, 2021 RICE 
FARMER OF THE YEAR 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in recognition of my constituent and friend 
Nicole Montna Van Vleck. Nicole was recently 
awarded the Rice Farmer of the Year award 
by Horizon Ag, Rice Farming, and USA Rice. 
The Montna Family began their rice oper-
ation in the late 1930s in Sutter County, Cali-
fornia. By the 1970s Nicole’s father, Al 
Montna, took over the ranch from his parents 
Dutch and Emma. Eventually, Al sold much of 
the land to his daughters Nicole and Michelle. 
Nicole currently serves as president and CEO 
of Montna Farms. Montna Farms produces 
predominately short-grain rice, that is milled in 
Williams, 
California 
and 
then 
distributed 
throughout the United States and internation-
ally. 
Nicole makes conservation a priority at 
Montna Farms, In 2000, a working lands ease-
ment was implemented on the ranch to pre-
serve the Pacific Flyway. Nicole and Montna 
Farms has also worked in partnership with nu-
merous environmental organizations, such as 
Nature Conservancy, California Waterfowl As-
sociation, the National Audubon Society, Cali-
fornia Trout and Point Blue, to ensure lands 
and wildlife are protected in and around their 
operation. 
Nicole has also dedicated herself to the rice 
industry by serving on numerous boards and 
committees, including: chair of the California 
Rice Industry Association, immediate past 
chair of California Producers Group and USA 
Rice Farmers, California Rice Commission, 
USA Rice Federation, the Rice Foundation, 
past chair of USA Rice Communication Com-
mittee, past co-chair Rice Sustainability and 
Competitiveness Task Force, past chair of 
state Farm Service Agency and State Fair ag 
advisory board, Northern California Water As-
sociation, UC Davis Dean’s advisory board, 
and River Valley Community Bank board. 
I congratulate Nicole on her achievement of 
Rice Farmer of the Year and I look forward to 
continue to work with her to support the Cali-
fornia rice industry.

KAZAKHSTAN’S 30TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, on De-
cember 16, 2021, the Republic of Kazakhstan 
will celebrate its 30th year of independence 
from the former Soviet Union. I congratulate 
President 
Kassim-Jomart 
Tokayev 
and 
Kazakhstan’s people for the notable progress 
they have made as a nation in that short pe-
riod of time. 
Strategically 
located 
between 
Europe, 
China, 
Russia, 
and 
the 
Middle 
East, 
Kazakhstan has been a global crossroads for 
centuries. Clearly, its place in the world today 
is more significant than ever. Kazakhstan’s vi-
brant economy—the largest by far in Central 
Asia—enhances the country’s strategic impor-
tance. 
One of Kazakhstan’s greatest and most en-
during achievements since independence has 
been its renunciation of nuclear weapons. 
Upon 
dissolution 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Union, 
Kazakhstan possessed the 4th largest nuclear 
arsenal in the world, and since then has main-
tained a consistent policy advocating nuclear 
non-proliferation. In 2006, Kazakhstan joined 
with the four other central Asian countries to 
sign The Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free 
Zone Treaty, committing to ban production, 
acquisition, or deployment of nuclear weapons 
across their territory. The Republic continues 
to lead in non-proliferation efforts. 
Kazakhstan has been a good friend to the 
United States over these thirty years, standing 
with us after 9/11, supporting our military ef-
forts both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and 
working actively with the U.S. and other coun-
tries to counter global terrorism. Since 2013, 
Kazakhstan has been an active participant in 
the CS+1 format, which is the platform for dia-
logue and cooperation between the U.S. and 
the five Central Asian nations. Further, in 
2018, the United States and Kazakhstan en-
tered into an Enhanced Strategic Partnership. 
In just 30 years, Kazakhstan has achieved 
great things and has taken its place in the 
international community of nations. I appre-
ciate the engagement of Kazakhstan with the 
U.S. on defense, security, counterterrorism, 
and on many other areas of mutual interest. I 
offer my best wishes to President Tokayev, to 
Ambassador Ashikbayev, and to the people of 
Kazakhstan on their Independence Day.

RECOGNIZING THE LATE YANDY 
CHIRINO 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
from the 24th District of the great state of Flor-
ida, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
late Yandy Chirino, a police officer, beloved 
son, brother, friend and part of the 5000 Role 
Models of Excellence family. 
Whereas, Yandy Chirino was born on March 
14, 1993, in Havana, Cuba. He migrated to 
Miami, Florida, with his parents as a young 
child and became a United States citizen at 
age ten; and 
Whereas, Officer Chirino graduated in 2011 
from Coral Park High School, where he was 
inducted into the 5000 Role Models of Excel-
lence. In 2015, he went on to study criminal 
justice at Florida International University and 
earned a bachelor’s degree. He also was an 
MVP athlete who played volleyball, soccer, 
baseball, and basketball; and 
Whereas, after graduating from the police 
academy, in 2017, Officer Chirino fulfilled his 
dream of becoming a police officer when he 
joined the Hollywood Police Department. 
Throughout his career, Officer Chirino earned 
many commendations, and he was recognized 
for his exceptional teamwork and dedication. 
In June 2020, he was named ‘‘Officer of the 
Month.’’ He served the Hollywood Police De-
partment with pride and professionalism, and 
had an incredible work ethic; and 
Whereas, Officer Chirino was adventurous. 
His YouTube videos show him paragliding in 
Colombia, flying a Cessna airplane in South 
Florida, and jet-skiing in Lake Powell, a res-
ervoir on the border of Utah and Arizona; and 
Whereas, Officer Chirino leaves to cherish 
his fond memories his parents, sister, two 
nephews, girlfriend, friends, all of fellow offi-
cers at the Hollywood Police Department and 
his 5000 Role Models of Excellence family; 
and now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That I, FREDERICA S. WILSON, a 
member of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives representing the 24th Congres-
sional District of Florida, am honored to recog-
nize the late Officer Yandy Chirino for his 
commitment, dedication and service to our 
community.

RECOGNIZING 
CAPTAIN 
DEREK 
HERRERA AS MY CONSTITUENT 
OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize Marine Corps 
Bronze Star veteran, Captain Derek Herrera, 
for my November Constituent of the Month. 
After graduating from the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy, Captain Herrera attended The Basic 
School 
and 
Infantry 
Officers 
Course 
in 
Quantico, Virginia. From then on, he was de-
ployed on several missions, the last of these 
in June of 2012 in Afghanistan. On this mis-
sion, Captain Herrera was shot and paralyzed 
from the chest down. He was medically evacu-
ated back to the United States. 
While he was determined to walk again, 
Captain Herrera came to realize that his injury 
was more permanent than he anticipated. With 
this new found understanding and a new mis-
sion, Herrera refused to give up his dream of 
finding normalcy, and in this process, discov-
ered his new life’s calling. Captain Herrera 
began forging his new path by pursuing a 
Master of Business Administration at UCLA 
and founding UroDev Medical, a company that 
designs and manufactures innovative solutions 
for men living with Urinary Retention. 
As he learned more about medical research 
and technology, Captain Herrera became in-
trigued not only by its’ potential to help him, 
but also others with disabilities, including his 
fellow injured veterans. That’s when Captain 
Herrera discovered the ReWalk Exoskeleton, 
a product that enables Captain Herrera to 
walk, stand, and sit. Although this technology 
isn’t permanent, Herrera saw a space and op-
portunity within the medical technology realm 
to give veterans injured in combat, another 
chance to feel a semblance of normalcy. 
Overcoming a life-changing injury is an in-
credible challenge, and I am inspired by the 
strength and perseverance Captain Herrera 
has embodied in his recovery journey and be-
yond. I thank Captain Herrera for his service 
to our country and his dedication to helping 
other veterans in similar circumstances. Cap-
tain Herrera’s personal decorations are a tes-
tament to his selfless service and sacrifice, in-
cluding the Purple Heart, Combat Action Rib-
bon, Bronze Star (with combat distinguishing 
device), Navy and Marine Corps Commenda-
tion Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medal. As long as I have the 
privilege to serve as Vice Chairman on the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I will look 
to heroes like Captain Herrera as an exem-
plary model of what it means to serve and 
support our veterans with reverence and re-
solve. I am deeply grateful for Captain Her-
rera’s continued service in helping our vet-
erans, and I’m proud to recognize him as my 
Constituent of the Month. 
HONORING ‘‘PATRIA Y VIDA’’ 
(HOMELAND AND LIFE) 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the anthem of freedom, 
‘‘Patria y Vida’’ (Homeland and Life) which be-
came a mantra for thousands of Cubans who 
took to the streets to protest the brutal and 
murderous Cuban dictatorship. 
The song is a collaboration between Cuban 
musicians in exile and on the island who have 
come together in opposition to the regime, and 
who together are demanding freedom of ex-
pression and respect for human rights. The 
co-authors 
are 
Yotuel 
Romero, 
Beatriz 
Luengo, Maykel Osorbo, Eliecer Marquez 
Duany ‘‘El Funky’’, Descemer Bueno, Alex-
ander Delgado and Randy Malcom. On No-
vember 18, 2021, ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ received two 
awards, Song of the Year and Best Urban 
Song at the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy 
Awards. 
Today, one of the co-authors of ‘‘Patria y 
Vida,’’ 
Maykel 
Castillo 
Pe´rez 
(commonly 
known as Maykel Osorbo), and Luis Manuel 
Otero Alca´ntara of the San Isidro Movement 
who appears in the music video, remain incar-
cerated in maximum security prisons in Cuba 
for simply participating in this song and speak-
ing out against oppression. Another co-author, 
Eliecer Marquez Duany ‘‘El Funky,’’ was sent 
into exile after being held on house arrest. 
These courageous artists suffer simply for 
voicing the fundamental freedoms that are the 
inherent rights of every person. They, and so 
many others in Cuba, have risked everything 
for freedom. 
Madam Speaker, the Cuban people will be 
free. Toward that goal, I am honored to high-
light the importance of a song that has be-
come an anthem for a movement, and for so 
many Cubans who are demanding freedom on 
the island. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this noble cause, in demanding that 
all political prisoners are released, basic rights 
to expression, assembly, and belief are re-
spected, and free, fair and multiparty elections 
are scheduled.

HONORING 
THE 
30TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
KAZAKHSTAN 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, this 
month marks the 30th anniversary of the Re-
public of Kazakhstan, which celebrates its 
Independence Day on December 16 each 
year. The United States was the first nation to 
formally recognize Kazakhstan’s independ-
ence in 1991, and the U.S.-Kazakh relation-
ship has only improved and strengthened over 
the past three decades. 
In 30 years, Kazakhstan has undergone sig-
nificant 
changes—largely 
overseen 
by 
Kazakhstan’s 
first 
President, 
Nursultan 
Nazarbayev. Early on, President Nazarbayev 
decided to close the Semipalatinsk nuclear 
test site and commit Kazakhstan to nuclear 
nonproliferation by dismantling the Soviet-era 
nuclear program. Despite pressure from other 
regional actors, one of the Republic’s first pol-
icy decisions was to stand with the United 
States and commit itself to a nuclear free fu-
ture. 
Kazakhstan 
remains 
as 
committed 
today—30 years later—to the issue of nuclear 
nonproliferation and continues to champion 
this cause globally. 
Additionally, former President Nazarbayev 
took steps early in Kazakhstan’s existence to 
align the nation with the West on economic 
issues—he was committed to creating a free 
market economy in Kazakhstan. From the 
start of the Republic, he understood the impor-
tance of U.S. investment’’ to not just the Re-
public, but also to the region. Thirty years 
later, Kazakhstan is a member of the World 
Trade Organization and has diligently worked 
to establish a hospitable business and invest-
ment climate for foreign investors. Kazakhstan 
became a member of the World Bank’s Inter-
national Center for Settlement of Investment 
Disputes (ICSID) in 1992, and the nation’s 
commitment to the rule of law has never been 
stronger. Today, U.S. companies are the larg-
est source of direct foreign investment in 
Kazakhstan. 
That’s why I support Permanent Normal 
Trade Relations for Kazakhstan and have 
joined in a bipartisan effort to pass legislation 
this Congress to ensure that Kazakhstan is lift-
ed from the Jackson-Vanik amendment—a law 
meant to target the Soviet Union, a country 
that no longer exists—and certainly shouldn’t 
impact fellow WTO members. And I can think 
of no better time, as Kazakhstan celebrates its 
30th birthday, to push for such a milestone. I 
encourage the House of Representatives to 
pass this legislation as soon as possible. 
While I acknowledge that there is still much 
work to be done in Kazakhstan, I recognize 
that 
current 
President 
Kassym-Jomart 
Tokayev has been highly focused on pursuing 
a series of internal reforms focused across al-
most all sectors of public life in Kazakhstan— 
from political and parliamentary reforms to up-
dates to existing statutes intended to increase 
the openness of civil society. Despite external 
pressures 
from 
influential 
neighbors, 
Kazakhstan has remained a peaceful and sta-
bilizing force in Central Asia for 30 years—this 
is a testament to the nation’s commitment to 
democracy and to Western ideals. As the peo-
ple of Kazakhstan celebrate this great mile-
stone, I applaud this nation on its 30 years of 
independence and look forward to continuing 
to strengthen the U.S.—Kazakh bilateral rela-
tionship in the coming years.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
RANDALL P. MANTOOTH 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding military service of 
Lieutenant Colonel Randall P. Mantooth. 
LTC Mantooth honorably served in various 
positrons of increasing responsibility through-
out his unprecedented military career span-
ning over thirty-three years, in which he dis-
played remarkable service to his community, 
State, and Nation. LTC Mantooth has proven 
to be an invaluable leader within the Mis-
sissippi Army National Guard, consistently 
demonstrating professionalism, positive lead-
ership, and responsibility to always consider 
the wellbeing of his soldiers, state employees 
and contractors. 
LTC Mantooth obtained his Bachelor of 
Science degree from William Carey University, 
is a graduate of Air Assault School, Quarter-
master Officer Basic & Advance Courses, 
Combined Arms and Services Staff School, 
the Support Operations Course, Theater 
Sustainment Course, and Command and Gen-
eral Staff College. LTC Mantooth is married to 
Lana Mantooth, and they have 5 children, 
Chandler, Lacy, Joseph, Hannah, and Kath-
erine. 
LTC Mantooth’s military assignments in-
clude company, battalion, and joint assign-
ments. At company level he served as Hous-
ing officer and commander under garrison 
command. At battalion level he served as lo-
gistics officer and supply officer. Assignments 
at regiment and brigade level include Division 
Chief and Chief of Integrations. He currently 
serves as The Deputy Installation Commander 
at Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center. 
LTC Mantooth distinguished himself through 
exceptional meritorious service as the Deputy 
Installation Commander, Camp Shelby Joint 
Forces Training Center. He is responsible for 
Master Cooperative Agreement, Integrated 
Training Area Management Program, Range 
and Training Land Program, and the Facility 
Management Program to include long/short 
range planning, scheduling, maintenance, re-
pair, rehabilitation, and construction of real 
property for the largest National Guard training 
installation in the nation and First Army’s mo-
bilization force generation installation. Camp 
Shelby serves as a training installation for all 
branches of the military to include National 
Guard and Active DOD service components. 
LTC Mantooth is a true American patriot 
who chose to answer the call to serve our 
country. It is an honor to recognize his unwav-
ering dedication to our country and to call him 
my friend.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF ELLEN BALIS 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Ellen Balis, staff 
director of the House Budget Committee, who 
recently retired after 37 years of exceptional 
service to the Congress and the Executive 
branch. 
Ellen began her career in Federal service at 
the White House Office of Management and 
Budget in 1984. She spent more than 20 
years at 0MB participating in the annual devel-
opment of the President’s Budget and advising 
senior administration officials on budget policy. 
In 2007, Ellen joined the Democratic staff of 
the House Budget Committee to serve as the 
senior budget analyst in charge of all the 
‘‘numbers.’’ In that role, she led development 
of the estimates for Democratic budget resolu-
tions and advised Members and staff on budg-
et policy, concepts, and scoring. She quickly 
demonstrated her invaluable expertise and be-
came a go-to person for analysis and advice. 
In 2017, when I became the Ranking Member 
of the Budget Committee, I asked her to serve

as our Staff Director. Her knowledge, tempera-
ment, strategic acumen, and drive for thor-
ough and accurate analysis made her the ob-
vious choice. 
Ellen is one of the most respected budget 
experts in Washington. And during her tenure 
as staff director, she was instrumental in the 
development and passage of several key 
pieces of legislation, including the 2021 con-
current budget resolution and the American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021. In fact, she delayed 
her planned retirement for several months to 
help shepherd these two critically important 
bills through final passage. She knew we had 
the 
chance 
to 
implement 
transformative 
change for our country, and she stayed so we 
could benefit from her expertise and experi-
ence. This selfless dedication to the work of 
the Congress and service to the American 
people are emblematic of Ellen’s character 
and entire career. It is impossible to overstate 
what an asset Ellen was to the Budget Com-
mittee and House Leadership overall. To 
make public policy that does what it is in-
tended to do, that truly delivers for the Amer-
ican people, everything must, quite literally, 
add up. And when it comes to budget tables 
and congressional calculations, there were 
numbers, and then there were Ellen’s num-
bers. Hers were the gold standard. Always re-
liable, always dependable—like Ellen herself. 
Over the years, Ellen impacted scores of 
Capitol Hill staffers who worked for and with 
her. From interns to senior analysts, her kind 
and steady leadership has left an indelible 
mark on all of those who learned from her and 
the example she set as an effective and dedi-
cated public servant. I want to thank Ellen for 
her candid advice, thoughtful analysis and 
most importantly, her friendship. I wish her 
nothing but the best in her hard-earned and 
well-deserved retirement.

HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Con-
nected Nation. Beginning in 2001 at Western 
Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Ken-
tucky, Connected Nation has grown and 
evolved to the national non-profit it is today. 
For the past 20 years, the people behind 
Connected Nation have devoted their efforts to 
expanding access to and the adoption of 
broadband and related technologies. The non- 
profit’s work includes job skills training, re-
search, mapping, and free connectivity and 
devices to at-risk youth. 
The non-profit’s mission statement reads in 
part, ‘‘Everyone belongs in a Connected Na-
tion.’’ Closing the digital divide is critical for 
Kentuckians and Americans across the coun-
try. Federal and private partnerships are key 
as we work to expand broadband access. 
Congratulations to Connected Nation on more 
than 20 years serving communities across the 
country.

CONGRATULATING LARRY J. 
MILLER 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Larry J. Miller on his re-
tirement 
after 
fifty 
years 
of 
service 
to 
PeoplesBank, which is headquartered in York 
County, Pennsylvania and operates branches 
throughout Pennsylvania’s Eleventh District. In 
1971, Larry started his career at PeoplesBank 
as a management trainee and just a decade 
later, he became the bank’s president, making 
him the youngest person in Pennsylvania to 
hold such a position. Larry’s hard work and 
dedication brought him further success as he 
took on the role of Chief Executive Officer for 
both PeoplesBank and its parent company, 
Codorus Valley Bancorp, serving in each of 
those positions for thirty-five years. 
Under 
Larry’s 
leadership, 
PeoplesBank 
opened twenty-five new branches, created 
mortgage and trust divisions, and grew to hold 
more than $2 billion in assets. Larry has simi-
larly taken on leadership and community serv-
ice roles, including positions as Chairman of 
the Board of Directors for several nonprofits, 
such as the United Way of York County and 
the Cultural Alliance of York County. 
We thank Larry for all that he has done for 
the people of Pennsylvania’s Eleventh District 
and wish him a restful and well-deserved re-
tirement. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MAJOR 
AARON GADBOIS 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Major Aaron Gadbois, who 
will be leaving my office after a year of distin-
guished service to the people of Texas Con-
gressional District 12. 
Aaron joined my office in January 2021 
through the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Legislative Fellowship Program. This highly 
selective program assigns servicemembers to 
congressional offices for one year, allowing 
them the opportunity to gain valuable legisla-
tive experience and contribute to the work of 
Congress. Demand for DOD Fellows always 
outstrips supply, so offices must compete to 
be assigned one. I was lucky to be assigned 
a Fellow of Aaron’s caliber. 
Aaron has a tremendous record of service. 
At 17, he enlisted in the Air National Guard 
and was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing, 
South Dakota Air National Guard, before later 
joining the ‘‘Capital Guardians’’ of the 113th 
Wing, District of Columbia Air National Guard, 
where he earned his commission. In recent 
years, he served in missions to the Korean 
Peninsula, the Philippine Islands and Poland, 
and after completing his service in my office, 
Aaron will return to the 113th Wing, where he 
will continue his service to our Nation. 
Aaron is one of six children of Barb and 
Larry Gadbois—in a family that epitomizes the 
Air National Guard’s citizen service member 
ideal. Remarkably, all six Gadbois siblings 
served, or are currently serving, in the Air Na-
tional Guard. A proud South Dakotan, Aaron 
loves the outdoors. His passion for hunting 
and fishing is clear to anyone who has taken 
a virtual meeting with him and noticed the tro-
phies that adorn his home office. 
With a Bachelor of Science degree from 
South Dakota State University and a Master of 
Business Administration degree from South-
west Minnesota State University, he has 
earned impressive civilian qualifications that 
have served him well from the private sector 
to his service as a full-time, active duty mem-
ber of the Air National Guard. 
The Appropriations Committee can be a 
daunting environment for a Fellow to enter, 
but Aaron took to his work methodically and 
enthusiastically, relishing the opportunity to ex-
pand his knowledge and contribute to the leg-
islative process. Aaron had a leg up in his wife 
Stephanie, a veteran Committee staff member. 
I suspect she may be partially responsible for 
his quick learning curve in the intricacies of 
the 
appropriations 
process. 
Additionally, 
Texas’s 12th District is home to numerous 
DOD priorities including the F–35 program, 
Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort 
Worth, and thousands of Active, Guard, and 
Reserve servicemembers. Aaron quickly built 
a relationship with these entities, mastered 
their issues, and was essential in helping me 
fight for them. 
Aaron made a great impact on his fellow 
staff members. He brought to my office a level 
head, hard-earned wisdom, and a genuine de-
sire to mentor and learn from his coworkers. 
He integrated seamlessly into the team, join-
ing us for our staff retreat and getting to know

not just his colleagues in my Washington of-

even more for his presence as a colleague. 
On behalf of Texas’ 12th Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer Aaron a heartfelt thank you and 
best wishes for the future.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PRO-
VIDE FOR INTERIM APPROPRIA-
TIONS FOR THE DISTRICT OF CO-
LUMBIA COURTS AND RELATED 
AGENCIES 
WITH 
RESPECT 
TO 
ANY FISCAL YEAR FOR WHICH 
APPROPRIATIONS ARE NOT OTH-
ERWISE 
PROVIDED 
FOR 
SUCH 
COURTS AND AGENCIES 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill that would exempt from federal 
government shutdowns the federal and inde-
pendent civil and criminal justice system law 
enforcement agencies that are exclusively or 
primarily federally funded but have exclusive 
jurisdiction over District of Columbia matters. 
This bill is modeled on a provision I have been 
able to get enacted each year since the 2013 
federal government shutdown to exempt the 
D.C. government from federal government 
shutdowns. 
This bill would exempt the following agen-
cies from federal government shutdowns: 
Court Services and Offender Supervision 
Agency for D.C., D.C. Courts, D.C. Public De-
fender Service, D.C. Commission on Judicial 
Disabilities and Tenure, D.C. Judicial Nomina-
tion Commission and D.C. Criminal Justice 
Coordinating Council. With one exception, 
these agencies are not under the District’s 
control and are funded exclusively by the fed-
eral government. The D.C. Criminal Justice 
Coordinating Council is an independent agen-
cy within the D.C. government with federal 
members that is primarily, but not exclusively, 
funded by the federal government. These 
agencies provide critical local services to the 
District, including law enforcement, and should 
continue to function during a federal govern-
ment shutdown. 
Each of these agencies has been adversely 
affected by federal government shutdowns, in-
cluding canceled services and furloughed em-
ployees. My bill would allow these agencies to 
continue to function during a federal govern-
ment shutdown, in much the same way that 
the D.C. government itself is now exempt from 
shutting down during a federal government 
shutdown. I urge my colleagues to support this 
important bill.

HONORING MR. SOHUM PAWAR 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an essential member of our team that 
worked to evacuate vulnerable Afghans during 
the fall of Kabul, Mr. Sohum Pawar. 
Originally from East Hanover, New Jersey, 
for many years, Mr. Pawar has worn many 
hats—scientist, 
engineer, 
and 
policy 
re-
searcher. Since graduating with honors from 
little-known schools such as Harvard Univer-
sity and Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, he’s worked on cybersecurity, climate, 
and energy policy at the White House, as-
sisted negotiators at the U.S. Department of 
State working on UN climate talks, and written 
speeches for the administrator of the U.S. En-
vironmental Protection Agency. 
Beyond public service, he’s also worked as 
a cyber threat intelligence analyst, assessed 
clean energy startups for a climate-focused 
venture capital fund, and developed policy and 
strategy for an advanced nuclear reactor start-
up. He also has experience in journalism, con-
ducting research for David Sanger, the promi-
nent national journalist for the New York 
Times and his bestselling book chronicling the 
rise of cyber warfare. 
The knowledge and experience Mr. Pawar 
acquired in all of these ventures were heavily 
relied upon when he joined our cobbled-to-
gether effort working to evacuate vulnerable 
Afghans from Kabul. For several sleepless 
nights, he was part of our tiger team—respon-
sible for gathering the required information for 
the group of Afghans, verifying the authenticity 
of documents, and supporting evacuees with 
letters of support of our own. 
Our mission depended on a broad cross- 
section of skills and traits, from perseverance 
to grit. Very few people could have handled 
the flood of information that our office received 
during those frantic days, and even fewer as 
quickly and efficiently as Sohum did. We 
needed Pawar’s to succeed, and it is thanks 
to him that we did. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Sohum 
Pawar for his willingness to go above and be-
yond the call of duty in our effort to evacuate 
Afghan allies from Kabul. For his meticulous 
record keeping, for his flexibility and persever-
ance, and for his dogged pursuit of any lead 
that would benefit the mission, I submit these 
words—may they stand as a tribute to his 
dedicated service when the moment called for 
it most. 
f 
HONORING RAVI S. PATEL 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Ravi Patel, a valued member of our 
effort to evacuate Afghan nationals from Kabul 
to Tirana, Albania. 
Mr. Patel has worked in several areas for 
several key players in the international arena, 
working as an advisor to former Secretary of 
Defense William J. Perry as well as serving as 
the consulting advisor for the executive direc-
tor of the UN’s Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- 
Ban Treaty Organization. As a graduate stu-
dent, he was the executive director of the 
Stanford University U.S.-Russia Forum, where 
he put on conferences, in Moscow and on 
Stanford’s campus, in order to bring together 
students and young leaders from both coun-
tries and further the bilateral relationship. 
Mr. Patel has always believed in the power 
of thinking outside the box to find solutions. 
The buses that he sourced were ultimately 
used to carry more than 100 individuals to 
safety in their hour of greatest need. As they 
made it through winding Kabul streets until 
they made it inside the gate at Hamid Karzai 
International Airport, Mr. Patel was in close 
coordination with our team. He was Lt.Gen. 
McMaster’s point person on our joint effort to 
evacuate them on a flight out of Kabul as well, 
helping to compile the flight manifest that air-
lifted men, women, and children—some as 
young as 2 years old—away from danger. 
In fact, when one of our evacuees, a four- 
year old with a severe congenital heart defect, 
needed urgent medical attention, Mr. Patel 
sprang into action. He gathered letters of sup-
port from some of the top pediatric doctors 
and surgeons in order to bring her to the U.S. 
for treatment. Thanks to his relentless pursuit 
chasing down leads through every available 
channel, the little girl and her family were 
granted humanitarian parole and admitted to 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Ravi 
Patel for his willingness to go above and be-
yond the call of duty in our effort to evacuate 
Afghan allies from Kabul and support them in 
their new life. For his resourcefulness amidst 
the fog of uncertainty and the chaos of the 
evacuation as well as for his tireless work in 
the weeks since, I submit these words—may 
they stand as a tribute to his dedicated service 
when the moment called for it most.

HONORING ALAMEDA COUNTY 
SUPERVISOR WILMA CHAN 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today, alongside Representative JUDY 
CHU, to honor the life of the late Alameda 
County Supervisor Wilma Chan, who tragically 
passed on November 3, 2021. We extend our 
deepest condolences to her children, grand-
children, family, staff, and loved ones, and to 
the people of Alameda County who she 
served so well during her 30-year career in 
public service. 
Supervisor Chan was born in Boston, MA, 
after her parents immigrated there from China. 
She attended public schools and went on to 
receive her bachelor’s degree in history from 
Wellesley College and her master’s degree in 
education policy from Stanford University. 
She was a trailblazer throughout her career. 
She was the first Asian American to serve on 
the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, to 
which she was elected in 1994, and later be-
came the first Asian American and first woman 
to hold the position of Majority Leader in the 
California State Assembly, where she rep-
resented the East Bay from 2000 to 2006. In 
2010, voters reelected her to the Alameda 
Board of Supervisors, where she continued to 
serve until her tragic death. 
Supervisor Chan’s unyielding commitment to 
the wellbeing of children, families, and her 
most 
vulnerable 
constituents 
prevailed 
throughout her legislative career. During her 
tenure in the State Assembly, she authored 
groundbreaking legislation that successfully 
made California the first state to ban toxic 
flame retardants, which resulted in a signifi-
cant decrease in how often those chemicals

are detected in women’s breast milk. During 
her time on the Alameda County Board of Su-
pervisors, she brokered a crucial deal to stop 
the San Leandro Hospital from closing, effec-
tively saving jobs, keeping an emergency de-
partment running, and strengthening our com-
munity’s healthcare infrastructure. 
Supervisor Chan was a great leader for the 
East Bay and the entire state, a consummate 
public servant, and a true friend. She em-
bodied service, uplifted the vulnerable, and 
used her platform for the betterment of all. 
She said, ‘‘My goal is really to make sure that 
children and families have everything that they 
need to be successful and to have a good 
quality of life.’’ That is the precise sentiment 
by which she served and lived. 
In her memory, let us continue the fight to 
remove systemic barriers and hurdles so that 
all members of our community can thrive and 
flourish. Supervisor Chan’s legacy should con-
tinue to inspire us to keep up the work for jus-
tice and equality to which she dedicated her 
life. 
As California Members of Congress, we 
thank Wilma for her service and honor her as 
an ardent champion for healthcare, education, 
children, seniors, and justice in our commu-
nity. May Wilma’s soul rest in peace and in 
power, and may her great legacy be a re-
minder of the work for justice and equality that 
remains. May we always honor Supervisor 
Chan, by taking the baton and rising to the oc-
casion, as she so lovingly did, in service to 
her fellow human beings. 
On behalf of the 13th Congressional District 
of California, I honor Supervisor Wilma Chan 
for her service and dedication.

HONORING DAVE KILCULLEN 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a former soldier and diplomat, and 
now author and scholar, Mr. David Kilcullen. 
For both his homeland, Australia, and for 
the United States, Mr. Kilcullen has enjoyed a 
long career in national security and counter-in-
surgency. After commissioning as a lieutenant 
with the Australian Army, he would go on to 
serve in a number of operational, strategic, 
command, and staff positions both in the 
Royal Australian Infantry Corps and Australian 
Defence Force. In 2005, after leaving active 
duty, he began working with our State Depart-
ment in the Office of the Coordinator for 
Counterterrorism. 
Working in the field led Mr. Kilcullen to Paki-
stan, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa and 
Southeast Asia, and he would ultimately assist 
with the drafting of Army’s Field Manual on 
counter-insurgency. He advised senior offi-
cials, from General David Petraeus to Sec-
retary of State Condoleeza Rice to NATO 
headquarters, on addressing the threat posed 
by insurgencies and guerilla warfare. He’s 
both a brilliant thought-leader as well as a 
man of action who supports aid agencies, 
non-government organizations, and local com-
munities in conflict and disaster-affected re-
gions around the world. 
Simply put, Madam Speaker, Mr. Kilcullen’s 
expertise is second to none, and when I need-
ed a trusted partner for a mission as complex 
as the evacuation of Afghan allies from Kabul, 
he was exactly the right person at the right 
time to pull it off. He personifies the Aussie 
notion of ‘‘mateship,’’ that unbreakable bond of 
friendship, loyalty, and shared purpose. 
Without Dave’s help, I’m not sure we would 
have been able to wrangle the caravan of 
buses and make sure they made it safely 
through the wire. When we were in the thick 
of it, we relied on his expertise and his deter-
mination, and only because of both were we 
able to prevent our Afghan allies—and the 
lives of so many others—from being lost. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Dave 
Kilcullen for his willingness to go above and 
beyond the call of duty in our effort to evac-
uate Afghan allies from Kabul and support 
them in their new life. For his unique ability to 
think outside the box to obtain safe passage 
for vulnerable Afghans and for his calm de-
meanor and resourcefulness in the midst of 
chaos and uncertainty, I submit these words— 
may they stand as a tribute to his dedicated 
service when the moment called for it most.

HONORING AMERICAN HEROES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, 2021 will tragically be remembered 
for the murders at Kabul International Airport 
of American Heroes: 
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David Espinoza, 
20, of Rio Bravo, Texas; 
Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole Gee, 23, of Sac-
ramento, California; 
Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin Hoover, 31, of 
Salt Lake City, Utah; 
Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, 23, of 
Corryton, Tennessee; 
Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, 22, of 
Indio, California; 
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, 
20, Jackson, Wyoming; 
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Dylan Merola, 20, 
of Rancho Cucamonga, California; 
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui, 
20, of Norco, California; 
Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan Page, 23, of 
Omaha, Nebraska; 
Marine 
Corps 
Sgt. 
Johanny 
Rosario 
Pichardo, 25, Lawrence, Massachusetts; 
Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto Sanchez, 22, 
Logansport, Indiana; 
Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, 20, 
of St. Charles, Missouri; and 
Navy Hospitalman Maxton Soviak, 22, of 
Berlin Heights, Ohio. 
As a military parent of four sons who have 
served overseas, I cannot imagine what their 
grief-stricken families are going through during 
this Christmas season. 
The decision of the President and the Vice- 
President in April to abandon the people of Af-
ghanistan and appease the Taliban/Al-Qaeda 
terrorists led to the deaths of these American 
Heroes. 
Sadly, this most catastrophic course of ac-
tion will clearly shift terrorist suicide bombers 
from the Afghanistan safe haven to American 
neighborhoods. 
The Global War on Terrorism continues with 
murderous attacks in New Zealand, Norway, 
the United Kingdom, Uganda, Israel, and at 
Afghan Mosques. 
The Democrat elite think they are smarter 
than everyone, and think Democrat voters and 
Democrat media are ignorant to believe that 
‘‘the United States ended 20 years of war.’’ 
They will gruesomely discover that now the 
targets are here at home. 
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who 
successfully protected America for 20 years, 
as the Global War on Terrorism continues 
moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to 
America.

HONORING JESSICA GARRELS 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an essential member of our team 
who helped us identify—and eventually evac-
uate—vulnerable Afghans after the fall of 
Kabul, Ms. Jessica Garrels of Michigan State 
University. 
For nearly a decade, Ms. Garrels has 
worked in project management, including di-
rect oversight and implementation of humani-
tarian assistance programs. Through her work, 
she’s helped vulnerable communities around 
the world—growing their institutional and 
human capacity, building resilience, and ex-
panding school nutrition and education initia-
tives. Community organizing is ingrained in 
Ms. Garrels’ DNA—she’s also served as a 
Peace Corps volunteer in Niger, a director 
with the Wisconsin League of Conservation 
Voters, and senior manager with Catholic Re-
lief Services in places like Burkina Faso, Mali, 
and Laos. 
It’s this knack for finding solutions that led 
her to play such a key role in our mission to 
evacuate Afghans affiliated with Michigan 
State University when Kabul fell to the 
Taliban. In early August, she was part of the 
team that submitted initial visa applications for 
staff and scholars associated with the univer-
sity’s Grain Research and Innovation (GRAIN) 
program. However, when the evacuation win-
dow shrunk from a few months to a matter of 
days, she sprang into action. With desperate 
pleas for help flooding her inbox, she turned 
them into an outreach campaign to contact 
Members of Congress and anyone else who 
could help. 
Thankfully, Ms. Garrels was able to join our 
ragtag effort—whereupon she immediately set 
out to gather critical information from GRAIN 
scientists and their immediate families. When 
our group of evacuees made it onto a caravan 
of buses and began their perilous journey to 
safety, Ms. Garrels worked around the clock to 
handle bureaucratic obstacles as they came 
up. I have no doubt that thanks to her quick 
and efficient response, lives were saved that 
would have otherwise been lost. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Ms. Jessica 
Garrels for her willingness to go above and 
beyond the call of duty in our effort to evac-
uate Afghan allies from Kabul and support 
them in their new life. For her skill in handling 
logistical challenges as they came up and for 
fast-tracking the requests for funding that al-
lowed vulnerable MSU-affiliated Afghans to 
make it on the flight, I submit these words—

FIRING OF TENNESSEE TEACHER 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I was sad-
dened when I read this morning about an inci-
dent concerning a teacher and a school board 
in East Tennessee. Matthew Hawn was fired 
for teaching about white privilege to his largely 
white classes of Contemporary Issues stu-
dents in Sullivan Central High School in Kings-
port, Tennessee. Mr. Hawn used both histor-
ical and contemporary examples, including the 
recent trial of Minneapolis police officer Derek 
Chauvin for the death of George Floyd. The 
General Assembly of Tennessee recently out-
lawed teachers from teaching critical race the-
ory or ideas that any race is ‘‘inherently privi-
leged, racist, sexist or oppressive’’ and backed 
the law with financial penalties. This sort of 
legislating is a throwback to an earlier period 
of intolerance and fear of history and science. 
Our state’s reputation was stained in the 
1920s by the prosecution of Dayton, Ten-
nessee, schoolteacher John Scopes for teach-
ing evolution. I had hoped those days were 
long behind us. I guess not. Confronting pain-
ful periods in our country’s history—such as 
slavery, segregation, the Trail of Tears, 
women denied voting rights—will make our 
students more tolerant, aware and worldly. I 
am deeply troubled by what has happened to 
Mr. Hawn and I hope decision makers will re-
store him to his place in the classroom where 
he can challenge young minds with new ideas.

HONORING MAJOR HOLLY 
GRAMKOW 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an essential member of my team who 
leveraged her military logistics experience to 
evacuate our Afghan allies to safety, Major 
Holly Gramkow. 
Since 2009, Major Gramkow has been a 
commissioned officer in the United States Air 
Force. She’s a graduate of the University of 
Portland Air Force Reserve Officer Training 
Corps and has over a decade of on-the- 
ground experience working on F–16, A–10 
and C–130J airframes. 
Throughout her military career, she has held 
positions as Fabrication Flight Commander, 
Aircraft Maintenance Unit Officer in Charge, 
and Director of Operations; as well as an Ex-
change Officer position with the Chilean Air 
Force as their Chief of Propulsion for F–16s. 
Major Gramkow has also served as an Aide- 
de-Camp and most recently as Branch Chief 
for Legacy Fighter Sustainment, Headquarters 
Air Force. She’s also the Chief Financial Offi-
cer for the Logistics Officer Association, a 
non-profit that supports the professional devel-
opment of her fellow officers. 
However, it is during her time with our office 
as a Defense Fellow where we’ve seen her re-
lentless commitment to others firsthand. De-
spite limited previous experience with the leg-
islative branch, she has taken to the work like 
a natural—leading key initiatives on veterans 
issues, military supply chains, and the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. Any one of 
these areas would take up the full bandwidth 
of a seasoned staffer, but she’s been able to 
handle the competing priorities with skill and 
aplomb. 
Our team was immensely fortunate to have 
Major Gramkow on staff when we were called 
to action and I am beyond thankful that we 
were able to rely on her skill to lead our effort 
in evacuating vulnerable Afghans. Despite 
being 2,000 miles away from Washington, 
D.C. and nearly 8,000 miles from Kabul at 
times during our mission, she made a dif-
ference at a time when for so many, things 
looked so grim. Our team owes an immense 
debt of gratitude to Major Gramkow—with the 
grit of Rosie the Riveter and the resourceful-
ness of her logistics officer training, she is 
truly a living embodiment of the core values of 
the Air Force: ‘‘integrity first, service before 
self, excellence in all we do.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Major Holly 
Gramkow for her willingness to go above and 
beyond the call of duty in our effort to evac-
uate Afghan allies from Kabul and support 
them in their new life. For her efforts to jump 
into the breach and serve around the clock as 
staff lead of our operation, and for marshaling 
the full weight of our office, actions which are 
in keeping with highest traditions of our mili-
tary and our Nation, I submit these words— 
may they stand as a tribute to her dedicated 
service when the moment called for it most.

SUPPORT FOR HEALTH BILLS 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of seven bills that originated in 
the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Com-
merce which I have the privilege to chair. 
These bipartisan bills address the following: 
health threats to newborns including stillbirth, 
newborn hearing loss, and birth defects; im-
proving cardiac care and oral health literacy; 
providing needed mental health support to 
doctors and other health care professionals; 
and improving diversity in the allied health 
workforce. 
H.R. 5487, the SHINE for Autumn Act of 
2021 seeks to reduce the impact of stillbirth by 
increasing research and data collection to ad-
dress the tragedy of the 24,000 babies who 
are stillborn in the U.S. every year. I thank my 
colleagues Reps. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER, 
LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, MARKWAYNE MULLIN, 
and KATHY CASTOR for authoring this legisla-
tion. 
H.R. 5561, the Early Hearing Detection and 
Intervention Act of 2021 reauthorizes pro-
grams at the Health Resources and Services 
Administration, Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, and the National Institute on 
Deafness and Other Communication Disorders 
to address hearing loss in newborns. I thank 
my colleagues Reps. BRETT
GUTHRIE
and 
DORIS MATSUI for authoring this legislation. 
H.R. 5551, the Improving the Health of Chil-
dren Act reauthorizes the National Center on 
Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. 
This critical center at the CDC helps advance 
the health of babies born with birth defects, 
developmental disabilities, blood disorders and 
other disabilities. I thank my colleagues Reps. 
BUDDY CARTER and LORI TRAHAN for authoring 
this legislation. 
H.R. 1193, the Cardiovascular Advances in 
Research and Opportunities Legacy Act funds 
NIH and CDC research and public education 
for valvular heart disease. The bill is named in 
honor of Carol Leavell Barr, the wife of Rep. 
ANDY BARR, who died last year of sudden car-
diac arrest, and I thank him for authoring this 
legislation. 
H.R. 1667, the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care 
Provider Protection Act is named after Dr. 
Lorna Breen, an emergency department doc-
tor who died by suicide last year. Physicians 
have the highest suicide rate of any profes-
sion, and this legislation provides grant fund-
ing for suicide-prevention and peer-support at 
healthcare facilities. It also helps ensure 
healthcare professionals can ask for mental 
health help without facing negative con-
sequences in their careers. I thank Reps. 
SUSAN WILD and DAVID MCKINLEY for author-
ing this legislation. 
H.R. 3320, the Allied Health Workforce Di-
versity Act of 2021 establishes a grant pro-
gram to improve diversity in the physical ther-
apy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, 
audiology, and speech-language pathology 
professions. I thank Reps. BOBBY RUSH and 
MARKWAYNE MULLIN for authoring this legisla-
tion. 
H.R. 4555, the Oral Health Literacy and 
Awareness Act of 2021 directs the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration to con-
duct a public education campaign to improve 
awareness of oral health. I thank Reps. TONY 
CA´RDENAS and GUS BILIRAKIS for authoring this 
legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for these bills 
and I thank the members of the House Health 
Subcommittee and the bipartisan sponsors of 
each bill for their good work.

HONORING SCHALK SPIES 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN

Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor our man on the ground and a key 
member of the team during our operation to 
evacuate Afghan allies from Kabul, Mr. Schalk 
Spies. 
Service is ingrained in Mr. Schalk’s DNA— 
he served as a captain in the South African 
National Defense Force, commanding several 
pathfinder and parachute Special Forces units 
on missions focused on border protection, sur-
veillance and reconnaissance. Since leaving 
the military, he’s worked as a security and op-
erations manager with over a decade of expe-
rience in private sector risk management for 
international clients. With his top-notch profes-
sionalism and attention to detail, he’s been re-
lied upon time and time again to oversee all 
aspects of operations and logistics for U.S. 
government and non-governmental organiza-
tion stakeholders.

right place at the right time, we turned to Mr.

as a combat rescue medic and survival expert 
was key to our success—and no doubt reas-
sured frightened men, women, and children as 
they traveled to the airport to escape the 
threats to their life. Despite a 25-hour 
harrowing journey as our buses made their 
way through Taliban checkpoints and stray 
gunfire, we didn’t lose a single member of our

TRIBUTE TO THE RT. REV. DR. 
ALPHONZA 
AND 
MRS. 
HESTER 
GADSDEN 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 8, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to two people who have 
dedicated their lives to their church and their 
community. Bishop Ordinary, Rt. Rev. Dr. 
Alphonza Gadsden, Sr. and Mrs. Hester 
Gadsden are retiring after a lifetime of service 
to the Reformed Episcopal Church. 
Bishop Gadsden, a native of St. Stephen, 
South Carolina, is the son of the late Silas and 
Leola Gadsden. An honors graduate of Rus-
sellville High School, he valued education and 
earned both a bachelor’s degree from Lime-
stone University in Gaffney, South Carolina 
and a Doctor of Ministry from Erskine Univer-
sity in Due West, South Carolina. Bishop 
Gadsden went on to receive his Doctor of Di-
vinity from the Commission on Theological 
Education of the Reformed Episcopal Semi-
nary in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. 
Bishop Gadsden served his country in the 
United States Army during the Vietnam War, 
reaching the rank of Sergeant and receiving 
numerous military medals and honors. Bishop 
Gadsden also served his country with a his-
toric 39-year career in the United States Post-
al Service: He retired from the Postal Service 
as the first African American Postmaster in the 
history of Kingstree, South Carolina. 
Mrs. Gadsden is a native of Hemingway, 
South Carolina and is the daughter of the late 
Isaac Daniel and Sallie Elizabeth Brown. She 
graduated from Hemingway High School the 
year South Carolina public schools deseg-
regated and later earned a bachelor’s degree 
from Limestone University. Following her call-
ing to work with young people, Mrs. Gadsden 
received 
an 
Education 
Certification 
from 
Coastal Carolina University and a Master of 
Education from Charleston Southern Univer-
sity. Additionally, she pursued a Master of Di-
vinity from Cummins Theological Memorial 
Seminary in Summerville. Mrs. Gadsden re-
tired as Principal of Kingstree Magnet Middle 
School in the Williamsburg County School Dis-
trict after 36 years as an educator. 
The Gadsdens were both raised in the 
Christian faith. Bishop Gadsden grew up in the 
Reformed Episcopal Church, and Mrs. Gads-
den was baptized in the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church. Throughout their adult lives, 
they followed Bishop Gadsden’s service in the 
Reformed Episcopal Church’s Diocese of the 
Southeast. 
Bishop Gadsden began his ministry as Vicar 
and Rector of Liberty RE Church in James-
town, South Carolina where he served for 17 
years. During his tenure, spiritual advance-
ment and membership increased significantly 
and the renovations improved the sanctuary 
and church building. 
As a minister in the Diocese of the South-
east, Bishop Gadsden was elected to the 
Standing Committee of the Diocese, where he 
served for several years and was later elected 
to serve as President. As the President of the 
Standing Committee, he led the Diocese for 
more than a year after the death of the late 
Rt. Rev. James C. West and was subse-
quently elected and consecrated Bishop in the 
Reformed Episcopal Church on November 17, 
2007. 
Bishop Gadsden served the Diocese for 
more than 14 years. Under his leadership, the 
Diocese added eight Clergy members, re-
formed its means of financial support, refur-
bished all its properties, eliminated its debts, 
and added two additional parishes. 
Bishop Gadsden served the National Re-
formed Episcopal Church in various capac-
ities. As a Clergyman, he was elected to the 
General Council of the Church and served on 
the General Committee as a Bishop of the 
Church. He also served as the Vice Chairman 
of the General Council until his retirement. On 
the Ecumenical level, Bishop Gadsden was 
one of the original organizers and signatories 
of the Anglican Church in North America 
(ACNA) at its inception in 2009. Currently, he 
serves as Co-Chairman of the Provincial 
Council of the Anglican Church in North Amer-
ica (ACNA). 
When her husband served as pastor/rector, 
Mrs. Gadsden served as Sunday school 
teacher, a choir member, and was instru-
mental in physical improvements at Liberty RE 
Church. During Bishop Gadsden’s tenure as 
Bishop, Mrs. Gadsden served on the diocesan 
level as treasurer of the Sunday School Con-
vention, a member of the Missionary Society, 
chairperson of the Committee on Women’s 
Work, and president of the Ministers’ Wives 
and Widows Alliance. In the National Re-
formed Episcopal Church, she served on the 
Doctrine and Worship Committee and on the 
Committee on Women’s Ministry. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in commending Bishop and 
Mrs. Alphonza and Hester Gadsden for their 
years of service to the Reformed Episcopal 
Church and to the community of Williamsburg 
County in South Carolina. They have fulfilled 
the biblical directive found in the Book of 
Micah, ‘‘to act justly, to love mercy, and to 
walk humbly with your God.’’

Service is ingrained in Mr. Mac Namee’s 
DNA—as a British Army officer, his service in-
cluded the Household Division’s Scots Guards 
as well as being an operator and commander 
in the United Kingdom’s Special Forces. He’s 
been deployed to numerous locations around 
the world, including extended operational tours 
of duty in Germany, Northern Ireland, and the 
Middle East during the Operation Desert 
Storm. 
From 2009 to 2011, Mr. Mac Namee was 
recalled to military service during the U.S. 
surge in Afghanistan. While the details of his 
actions as part of a Special Operations Task 
Force remain classified, they were conducted 
in extremely hostile environments and were 
considered pivotal to the success of the cam-
paign being conducted by U.S. and NATO 
forces. For his command of operations in the 
interests of national, security, including being 
seconded to the U.K.’s Security Service (Ml5), 
he was awarded the Queen’s Commendation 
for Valuable Service. 
After retiring from the military, Mr. Mac 
Namee was appointed as an associate pro-
fessor at the Bush School of Government and 
Public Service at Texas A&M University. His 
expertise in counterterrorism, counterinsur-
gency, intelligence operations, covert oper-
ations, nuclear security and cybersecurity led 
him to teach graduate classes to aspiring na-
tional security professionals. 
During our operation to evacuate vulnerable 
Afghans, Mr. Mac Namee’s skills to coordinate 
the logistics of a caravan into the airport and 
to help run a second caravan of buses was in-
strumental to our success. When we were in 
the thick of it, we relied on his expertise and 
his determination, and only because of both 
were we able to prevent our Afghan allies— 
and the lives of so many others—from being 
lost. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Richard 
Mac Namee for his willingness to go above 
and beyond the call of duty in our effort to 
evacuate Afghan allies from Kabul and sup-
port them in their new life. For his grit and de-
termination to get the caravan of buses set up 
and going and for his relentless commitment 
to the mission until it was successfully com-
pleted, I submit these words—may they stand 
as a tribute to his dedicated service when the 
moment called for it most.
