HONORING THE LEGACY OF RUTH 
ELLIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, during Pride Month, to honor 
the phenomenal Ruth Ellis, a former 
Detroit resident who was the oldest 
surviving open lesbian and an LGBTQ 
rights activist. 
Born in 1899, and living until the age 
of 101, she came out as a lesbian around 
1915. She took in LGBTQ-plus youth 
experiencing 
homelessness 
and 
dis-
placement, 
and 
her 
home 
became 
known as ‘‘the gay spot.’’ 
Not only did she give refuge to our 
youth, but she provided them books, 
food, and even assistance with their 
college tuition. She was an icon. 
Still today, LGBTQ-plus youth expe-
rience homelessness at a dispropor-
tionate rate. The Ruth Ellis Center in 
Highland Park was created in the 13 
District Strong and was named after 
and in honor of Ms. Ellis. They provide 
safe, 
affordable, 
identity-affirming 
housing for marginalized Black and 
Brown 
Detroiters, 
especially 
our 
LGBTQ-plus youth. Join me today in 
honoring and recognizing Ruth Ellis 
and the incredible advocacy of the 
Ruth Ellis Center and their incredible 
team. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF GREG MUDGE 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I cel-
ebrate the memory of Greg Mudge, a 
longtime 
community 
advocate 
and 
businessowner in Detroit, who we trag-
ically lost last year. Greg was a be-
loved member of our community, and 
his sudden death was a shock to us all. 
When he first opened Mudgie’s Deli 
back in 2008, Greg was already consid-
ered a member of our community. A 
food service veteran himself, he built 
and managed his own business with the 
heart and soul of family. His approach 
was ‘‘all hands on deck,’’ and he never 
shied away from any task and was al-
ways ready to give a helping hand. 
Greg’s commitment to serving home-
made food, including incorporating 
family recipes, made Mudgie’s Deli a 
neighborhood 
standout. 
More 
than 
that, Greg’s enthusiasm and passion 
for his work shined through in all that 
he did. Greg Mudge embodied the spirit 
of our beautiful southwest Detroit 
community and our Corktown neigh-
borhood. Please join me in honoring his 
memory. 
REFORM THE MULTIEMPLOYER 
PENSION SYSTEM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, Democrats 
keep forcing taxpayers to bail out fail-
ing and mismanaged union-run multi-
employer pension plans, and it needs to 
stop. 
The Committee on Education and 
Labor has dedicated considerable time 
and held countless hearings on the 
problems posed by multiemployer pen-
sion plans and the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation’s, PBGC’s, mul-
tiemployer insurance program. 
Unfortunately, unlike previous bipar-
tisan legislation to address the failing 
system, our Democrat colleagues de-
cided to go it alone by enacting the de-
ceitful American Rescue Plan Act, 
ARPA. 
Under the guise of COVID relief, 
ARPA included an irresponsible and 
uncapped taxpayer bailout of failing 
and insolvent multiemployer pension 
plans. Let me repeat, there is no cap on 
the amount of taxpayer dollars that 
PBGC may send to multiemployer 
plans. 
This is especially concerning given 
that multiemployer plans are currently 
underfunded by $756 billion. 
Unsurprisingly, the cost of ARPA’s 
pension bailout program continues to 
grow. The Congressional Budget Office 
originally estimated it would cost tax-
payers $86 billion. Five months later, 
PBGC estimated it would likely dis-
tribute $94.2 billion. After 2 more 
months, PBGC estimated it would like-
ly distribute $97.2 billion and, in one 
scenario, could distribute upward of 
$147 billion. 
To date, PBGC has disbursed $6.7 bil-
lion to 26 plans, and this is just the be-
ginning.

east and Southwest Areas Pension Plan

June 14, 2022 
requested a staggering $35 billion from 
taxpayers. PBGC is reviewing an addi-
tional eight applications requesting a 
total of $1.1 billion. In all, PBGC is ex-
pected to send money to over 250 pen-
sion plans. 
PBGC has confirmed what we knew 
to be true, but others refused to admit: 
ARPA’s taxpayer-funded bailout will 
not fix a thing. 
In September, the agency stated the 
massive influx of taxpayer dollars will 
only delay the immediate insolvency of 
the multiemployer insurance program, 
and insolvency is still likely. Simply 
throwing money at plans will not solve 
the problem. 
ARPA failed to address the under-
lying structural issues in the multiem-
ployer system that contributed to the 
crisis, thus ensuring that plan mis-
management and underfunding will 
persist. In fact, ARPA includes a gall-
ing provision that explicitly bars PBGC 
from reforming plan governance or al-
tering plan-funding rules of plans re-
ceiving a bailout. 
It is clear to me that the mismanage-
ment of multiemployer plans and the 
risks they pose to workers, retirees, 
and the taxpayer cannot be ignored. 
Congress must require multiemployer 
plans to measure their liabilities accu-
rately and collect adequate contribu-
tions to fund benefits. 
Failing and insolvent plans must 
stop making promises that they are 
unable and unwilling to keep. It is 
common practice for insolvent plans, 
which do not have enough funds to pay 
current retirees, to continue allowing 
active participants to accrue benefits 
and enroll new workers into the plan. 
This is deceptive. This is wrong. This 
must stop. 
Congress should increase multiem-
ployer insurance premiums to account 
for the risk that underfunded plans 
pose to PBGC. 
Multiemployer plans pay a meager 
flat-rate premium of $31 per partici-
pant. In contrast, the single-employer 
program requires plans to pay an $88 
flat-rate premium in addition to a vari-
able rate premium based on a plan’s 
level of underfunding. 
Decades of chronic underfunding and 
false promises have put millions of 
workers and retirees at risk. By prop-
ping up this clearly unsustainable sys-
tem without enacting reforms, ARPA 
continues to enable and encourage the 
irresponsible behaviors that caused 
this crisis. 
Taxpayers saving for their own re-
tirements should not be on the hook to 
pay for the broken promises of union- 
run multiemployer pension plans. 
There must be accountability for this 
gross mismanagement and real reform 
to ensure the multiemployer pension 
system does not continue to deceive 
workers and the American people.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ELTON DEAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the extraordinary life 
and legacy of Montgomery County 
Commissioner Elton Dean, who passed 
away at the age of 72 on June 7, 2022. 
A native of Alabama’s Seventh Con-
gressional District, Chairman Dean 
graduated 
from 
Montgomery’s 
own 
George Washington Carver High School 
before attending Selma University, 
where he received his associate’s de-
gree. 
Returning to Montgomery, Chairman 
Dean pursued his bachelor of science at 
the Alabama State University, where 
he graduated in 1971 with a degree in 
business and economics. 
Chairman Dean went on to become a 
successful 
businessman, 
putting 
to 
work his entrepreneurial spirit to serve 
and improve his community as owner 
of Dean Realty as well as 21st Century 
Hair Studio. 
In November 2000, Chairman Dean 
was first elected to the Montgomery 
County Commission, where he humbly 
and faithfully served the Second Dis-
trict for over 20 years. Dean was elect-
ed vice chairman in November 2004 be-
fore making history in March 2009 as 
the first African American to serve as 
chair of the Montgomery County Com-
mission. Montgomery County includes 
the historic city of Montgomery, Ala-
bama. 
Known as a dedicated public servant 
and 
passionate 
community 
leader, 
Chairman Dean’s legacy lives on in the 
countless projects and initiatives that 
came into fruition under his leader-
ship, including the implementation of 
Montgomery County’s back-to-school 
sales tax holiday. 
Chairman Dean is also known for 
bringing the commission meetings to 
the people by holding his ‘‘On the 
Road’’ initiative, which allowed con-
stituents to meet directly with their 
representatives. 
Chairman Dean worked tirelessly to 
improve Montgomery County’s eco-
nomic well-being. Among his most no-
table achievements, he oversaw the im-
plementation of the 1 percent sales tax 
in 2001, which generated over $428 mil-
lion for public education in Mont-
gomery County, delivering critically 
needed resources to the children of our 
community. 
Chairman Dean never missed an op-
portunity to give back. Throughout his 
adult life, he held countless positions, 
including serving on boards and organi-
zations throughout Montgomery Coun-
ty, which included as executive board 
member of the South Central Alabama 
Boys and Girls Club as well as board 
member for the Montgomery Improve-
ment Association, board member for 
the 
Central 
Alabama 
Community 
Foundation, and chairman of the trust-
ee board and mass choir member of Mt. 
Zion African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church. He was commissioner of the 
Central Alabama Amateur Baseball 
League and commissioner of the South-
ern League Dixie Youth Baseball. 
A very strong advocate for his alma 
mater, Chairman Dean returned to the 
Alabama State University later in life 
to serve as chairman of the board of 
trustees for the Alabama State Univer-
sity. In this role, he served for 9 years 
and generated $525 million worth of 
campus improvement. 
In his role as chairman of the board 
of trustees for Alabama State Univer-
sity, I got to know Chairman Dean be-
cause he gave me, as a young bond law-
yer, the opportunity to represent my 
parents’ alma mater, the Alabama 
State University. 
It was Chairman Dean who encour-
aged me to run for Congress, and for 
his mentorship and his friendship, I am 
forever grateful. 
Chairman Dean rightfully received 
numerous awards throughout the com-
munity: the Pioneer Award by The 
Montgomery 
Tuskegee 
Times; 
the 
Montgomery County Area Chamber of 
Commerce Chairman’s Award in 2012; 
the Citizen of the Year Award by the 
Sigma Phi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi 
Fraternity in 2004; the Citizen of the 
Year Award by Kappa Alpha Psi Fra-
ternity, Montgomery’s Alumni Chap-
ter; as well as the Kershaw YMCA Man 
of the Year. 
Chairman Dean was a true public 
servant and a servant leader. Though I 
know so many of us are heartbroken by 
his passing, I am eternally grateful for 
our partnership on behalf of the citi-
zens of Montgomery County, Alabama, 
and blessed to have been guided by his 
mentorship as well as his friendship 
over the years. 
May his family find comfort in know-
ing that Elton Dean’s legacy will live 
on in the hearts of all those he im-
pacted. As we mourn his passing, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Montgomery 
County 
Commission 
Chairman Elton Dean.

RUNAWAY DEFICIT SPENDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, inflation is 
at the highest level we have seen since 
Jimmy Carter was in the White House. 
I have spoken many times about ris-
ing prices being fueled by out-of-con-
trol spending. Today, I rise with even 
more proof that this has been the case. 
President Biden’s 2021 COVID stim-
ulus bill overheated the economy, just 
as I, and many other Republican Mem-
bers of Congress, along with numerous 
economists from both sides of the po-
litical divide, predicted. 
Now a report by the non-partisan 
Congressional Budget Office shows that 
spending did, in fact, create a worker 
shortage which strained supply chains 
and contributed to the economic crisis 
in which we find ourselves today. 
One year ago, companies across mid-
dle Tennessee were struggling to find 
workers. More than 160,000 Tennesseans 
were unemployed; yet 218,000 jobs were

available. Folks were earning $15.75 an 
hour to stay home because of the un-
necessary 
$2 
trillion 
bill 
pushed 
through by congressional Democrats 
on a party line vote. 
Employers became desperate. Many 
were forced to offer massive sign-on bo-
nuses and other incentives just to find 
enough workers to continue operating 
as normal. Unfortunately, some had to 
close their doors. 
Tennessee’s Governor Bill Lee, a 
businessowner himself, recognized the 
damage enhanced Federal unemploy-
ment benefits were causing on res-
taurants and retail stores. He noticed 
many couldn’t compete with $300 a 
week from the Federal Government on 
top of State unemployment benefits. 
Fortunately, he put a stop to the 
flow of Federal unemployment dollars 
in Tennessee, and he was right. At last 
check, there were about 13,000 unem-
ployment claims in Tennessee, com-
pared to roughly 60,000 claims this time 
last year. 
Still, the cost of living has increased 
every month under the Biden adminis-
tration, and the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office projects it will 
continue to impact Americans at least 
into 2023. 
This is what happens when you do 
what is politically expedient. This is 
the direct result of runaway deficit 
spending. 
The Federal Reserve is now having to 
be the adult in the room and raise in-
terest rates to lower inflation. Raising 
interest rates is a harsh step, but one 
made necessary by the Biden adminis-
tration’s reckless handling of the econ-
omy. 
It will make it harder and more ex-
pensive to borrow money for your first 
home or to buy a new car. Raising in-
terest rates will also cause our econ-
omy to slow down. This means people 
will lose their jobs, their savings, and 
in many cases, even their small busi-
nesses. 
Our economy already got 1.5 percent 
smaller in the first quarter of the year. 
It is why many economists are pre-
dicting a recession or worse in the next 
12 months. 
It didn’t have to be this way. The 
President and congressional Democrats 
didn’t have to borrow and spend so 
much money. This administration in-
herited one of the strongest economies 
in my life. It took fewer than 2 years 
for them to completely destroy it. 
President Biden must do better. 
f 
UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, when the 
pandemic closed schools and left mil-
lions of children without meals they 
needed, our government took action. 
Emergency waivers eliminated income 
caps and gave meal providers flexi-
bility in delivering food. 
Even now, with schools reopened, 
these 
waivers 
are 
getting 
healthy 
meals to children without burying fam-
ilies under mountains of paperwork, 
but these provisions are set to expire 
on June 30. 
As 97 percent of meal providers like 
schools struggle to pay soaring food 
prices, these protections should be 
strengthened, not stopped. 
This year, California became the first 
State to provide free meals to any stu-
dent. Offering no-cost meals to every-
one, regardless of income, helps re-
sources reach the kids who need them 
most. 
This will also help California’s kids 
in schools perform better. Free meals 
contribute to better attendance, fewer 
nurse visits, and higher test scores. 
California’s universal meal program 
will benefit schools and families. The 
Nation should follow our example. 
TAKING ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
Ms. 
PORTER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
greater our delay in taking action on 
climate change, the higher the price 
tag will be for families and our econ-
omy. 
Last 
week, 
Californians 
suffered 
through an intense heat wave. Tem-
peratures went over 100 degrees in 
parts of our State. That is bad for pub-
lic health and bad for our economy. 
A study by the Atlantic Council esti-
mates that the total economic loss 
from excessive heat is at least $100 bil-
lion annually. They also estimate that 
this loss could double by 2030 and quin-
tuple by 2050 if we don’t take climate 
action. 
Simply put, the fiscally responsible 
thing to do is for Congress to act 
quickly to prevent further losses. Tak-
ing climate action will lower and sta-
bilize costs for families. 
High temperatures aren’t just bad for 
human health. They are bad for our 
economy. Heat waves push prices for 
electricity higher, costing us billions. 
We should not leave families in Cali-
fornia and across the country to figure 
out their budgets while Washington 
figures out climate change. 
The need for climate change is ur-
gent, not just for our planet, but also 
for our pocketbooks. 
PTSD AWARENESS MONTH 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, our Na-
tion is failing people with post-trau-
matic stress disorder. During June, 
PTSD Awareness Month, we must com-
mit to doing better. 
Mental health affects many across 
our Nation, but I rise today to shine 
light on the brave young people dealing 
with PTSD. 
Too 
many 
Americans, 
including 
many with PTSD, go without the men-
tal healthcare they need because their 
insurance won’t cover it. I wrote a bill, 
which is now Federal law, to crack 
down on insurance companies that 
break the rules and refuse to cover 
mental health the same way they cover 
physical health. I am proud the House 
is considering additional proposals I 
have worked on to strengthen the en-
forcement of protections for mental 
health coverage. 
When a child experiences a traumatic 
event, like emotional or sexual abuse, 
it harms their emotional, social, and 
cognitive development. These adverse 
childhood experiences are linked to 
substance use disorder, chronic health 
issues, and PTSD. 
We cannot let trauma or related 
challenges hold students back from 
getting high quality educations. The 
effect of these experiences doesn’t end 
when children leave their homes for 
college. They bleed into their daily 
lives, including in the classroom. 
I am proud to introduce legislation, 
the Student Mental Health Rights Act, 
which would direct the Department of 
Education to study mental health, 
issue guidance to help schools level the 
playing field, and support students in 
overcoming their mental health chal-
lenges so they can complete their 
schooling. Our students need this help. 
For Americans with PTSD of all 
ages, awareness is not enough. They 
need action. 
f 
RETURNING TO FISCAL SANITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to dis-
cuss the chilling state of the American 
economy. The stock market is tanking. 
The American people know what a dis-
aster President Biden and the major-
ity’s economic policies have been, and 
they are acting accordingly and ex-
pressing the lowest consumer con-
fidence in a record 50 years of data. 
Pumping 
trillions 
in 
spending 
through this body, including the so- 
called American Rescue Plan, has, in 
large part, caused a 40-year high in in-
flation as the CPI rose to 8.6 percent in 
May. 
The Nation is $30 trillion in debt, and 
the CBO predicts $1.6 trillion in deficits 
over the next decade. The Federal Re-
serve will be forced to continue to raise 
interest rates, further exacerbating the 
beleaguered economy. 
Gas prices are at $5 a gallon, due to 
the President’s assaults on American 
oil drilling and fracking and domestic 
energy exploration, and the Green New 
Deal priorities of the majority and this 
administration are exacerbating the 
energy crisis. 
As The Wall Street Journal recently 
asked: Has anyone, other than unsuc-
cessful green energy subsidy firms, 
benefited from the Biden economy? 
What is more, the President’s $5.8 
trillion tax-and-spend budget is fiscally 
irresponsible. Biden’s budget cuts $428 
million in Customs and Border Protec-
tion’s budget in the midst of a border 
crisis. 
It skyrockets Federal spending by a 
third, compared to prepandemic levels, 
calls for $2.5 trillion in tax hikes, and 
sets this country on a course of ex-
tended fiscal doom at a time when we 
are currently on the precipice of a re-
cession. 
The American economy cannot sus-
tain a Federal Government that is

vacuuming tax dollars out of the pock-
ets of the private sector at a record 
pace. 
Still, today, the majority will not 
even propose a budget, much less one 
that achieves balance, and instead, 
funds the government and inflates the 
currency 
through 
massive 
omnibus 
bills and continuing resolutions. 
We need to return to regular order in 
this House and return to fiscal sanity 
to rescue this economy from a reces-
sion that looms large in what is likely 
to be a long, hot summer for millions 
of American families. 
f 
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the record- 
breaking number of jobs created under 
President Biden’s watch, his plan to 
lower costs for hard-working American 
families, and our plan to continue 
building a better America. 
Since President Biden took office, 
the economy has added 8.7 million new 
jobs—8.7 million new jobs. That is stag-
gering. Fun fact, Mr. Speaker, this is 
the most jobs added in any President’s 
first 16 months. I repeat: The most jobs 
added 
in 
any 
President’s 
first 
16 
months. This is historic. 
The fact that the economy is boom-
ing is no accident. You see, President 
Biden laid the foundation for an amaz-
ing recovery through his American 
Rescue Plan and vaccination program. 
This plan got people back to work, kids 
back in schools, and helped the Amer-
ican economy bounce back. 
Together, 
with 
President 
Biden, 
House Democrats are not only bringing 
back jobs, but we are growing pay-
checks for households across the coun-
try. Because of this, unemployment is 
near historic lows, and even better, the 
number of Americans relying on unem-
ployment benefits has dropped by more 
than 90 percent. This is huge. 
In short, our Nation has recovered 96 
percent of the jobs lost during the pan-
demic and is on track to return to 
prepandemic employment levels before 
the end of the year. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a direct result of 
President Biden’s leadership, Congress’ 
partnership, and the backing of the 
American people. 
While many Americans are back at 
work, we have heard calls from hard-
working families struggling with the 
cost of inflation. Sadly, Putin’s war 
against Ukraine is now the biggest sin-
gle driver of inflation, but we have a 
plan for this too. 
I am proud to report that House 
Democrats and President Biden are 
acting to lower gas prices by fighting 
Putin’s price hike. The United States 
is on track to produce a record amount 
of oil next year, and coming from 
Texas, that is music to our ears, and 
the President is working with the in-
dustry to accelerate this output. 
Democrats are also laser focused on 
lowering everyday costs for families at 
the grocery store, and they are also im-
proving the supply chain. We are fight-
ing for everyday Americans by reduc-
ing the cost of everyday goods through 
the COMPETES Act. 
This landmark legislation will lower 
costs and strengthen our supply chains 
by making more products right here in 
America: Made in USA. Again, this will 
create more jobs. 
We also have great news on the Fed-
eral deficit. Biden is still on track to 
drop the budget deficit by $1.6 trillion 
this year alone. 
Mr. Speaker, another fun fact, Presi-
dent Biden has cut the deficit more 
this year than any President in his-
tory. I repeat, more than any President 
in history. In contrast, Mr. Speaker, 
the Trump administration increased 
the Federal budget deficit every single 
year they were in office. 
All 
things 
considered, 
President 
Biden and House Democrats are not 
only working together to continue 
building a better America for all Amer-
icans, but we are delivering on that

PUTTING AMERICANS LAST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as the 
4-day tour occurs inside the Capitol on 
January 6, where a loaded, biased com-
mittee attempts to parse the words of 
the President on the day, we have 
many other crises to deal with in this 
country that are directly affecting and 
harming the American people, their 
ability to do their basic day-to-day op-
eration of their homes, get to their 
jobs, get their kids to school. 
So what are we doing? What are we 
doing? Chasing January 6. Look at our 
border right now, where under the cur-
rent Biden policies, we are attracting 
the largest caravan ever of illegal 
aliens heading toward our border. The 
idea that we are going to get rid of 
title 42 or just the general porosity of 
the border anyway. It has been a giant 
magnet ever since January 20, 2021, 
when this President came in and start-
ed shredding our border policy. 
We 
had 
success 
under 
President 
Trump, where we had the best control 
of the border we had in quite a while, 
with 
approximately 
450 
additional 
miles of rebuilt or new fence that was 
very effective in those zones. 
So what do we have now? We have 
warehouses and stacks and pallets of 
fence material, millions of dollars’ 
worth of it, lying about on our south-
ern border being stored instead of in-
stalled. 
We heard some chatter here a couple 
months ago from the Biden administra-
tion, well, maybe we should just go 
ahead and put up those additional 
pieces there where there are some obvi-
ous gaps. 
I had a chance to visit Yuma, Ari-
zona a few weeks ago. It was pretty in-
credible because there would be miles 
of fence, but there would be these gaps 
occasionally, and that is where people 
would pour through illegally. Amazing. 
We could rectify that by just filling a 
lot of the gaps, thereby making our 
Customs and Border Patrol job much 
easier by being able to focus on fewer 
areas instead of wide-open spaces or 
gaps all along our border. 
But, no, it seems to be about some 
other agenda. 15,000 people possibly 
will crowd the border here soon under 
the idea that we are going to possibly 
let title 42 go. Thankfully, two dif-
ferent courts have stopped that. 
So what are we doing? The terrorists 
come across our border really almost 
unchecked. They capture a handful of 
them, but how many are getting by 
that get away? We don’t know that. 
Are they starting cells right here in 
our country? Why not? 
As we know, in April, there were over 
230,000 encounters, they call them, at 
the southern border. That is the high-
est in U.S. history for one month. Why 
is this? Because we have a giant mag-
net, again, turned on by this adminis-
tration saying, come on across. You 
only need to have a sliver of an excuse 
for asylum. 
The asylum law needs to be changed 
if that is how they are going to enforce 
it because it has to be for a true threat. 
You also have to seek asylum in the 
country closest to you, if you are an 
asylum seeker and that is what you are 
really after, but one closest to you, not 
pick and choose what country you are 
going to move up to, basically the 
United States with all the benefits it 
hands out. 
According to polling, when you ask 
the American people, who are worried 
about gas and groceries or whether an-
other load of formula is going to come 
in from Europe on a military transport 
in time for their small children to be 
able to have the type of food that they 
are accustomed to, the majority of 
Americans disapprove of the Biden ad-
ministration’s operation of our bor-
ders, especially the elimination of title 
42, which is a health risk issue. 
When you talk about the issue of for-
mula, we are putting Americans last, 
when 
the 
Biden 
administration 
prioritized shipments of pallets of baby 
formula to the border holding stations 
instead of across the fruited plain. It is 
pretty pathetic. Indeed, it was this ad-
ministration whose FDA stepped in on 
the major producer of formula and 
said: We are going to shut you down be-
cause we had a couple of incidents that 
have been reported. 
So what happens? The FDA didn’t 
call back when the company that is the 
major producer of formula asks, What 
is it we need to do to be in compliance 
in your eyes? The administration knew 
about this, yet they prioritized what

formula was available to go down to 
the border stations there. Thankfully, 
recently, we passed legislation so that 
we could release more supplies to have 
them be eligible for those who are on 
assistance. 
As we see the disaster on the border, 
I don’t see a single remedy even being 
talked about by the Biden administra-
tion. They don’t really care about the 
American people.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, on this Flag Day, when 
we pause to acknowledge the symbol of 
liberty and democracy to which we 
pledge our allegiance, remind us of the 
significance of Your authority over 
this land of the free and the brave and 
the faithfulness to which we are called 
to give to You. 
In this season when we celebrate 
with cookouts and patriotic festivities, 
when we stand and salute the national 
ensign held with great honor in the 
hands of scouts and veterans, may we 
pause first in homage to the author of 
our freedoms in whose hands our lives 
are held. 
And as we consider the multitude of 
times this emblem of our country has 
draped the caskets of men and women 
who have worn the cloth of our Nation, 
having sacrificed their comforts, their 
security, their very lives in its defense, 
may we find strength in the covering of 
the peace You keep over our land and 
the solace You provide all those who 
grieve. 
Almighty God, long may our flag 
wave under the banner of love You hold 
over us. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman

Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas led the

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

TAKING ACTION TO END GUN 
VIOLENCE 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, 1 month ago today, my com-
munity of Buffalo was targeted by a 
racist mass shooter. The lasting toll 
and trauma of gun violence is evident 
and perhaps most compelling through 
the words of Buffalo students in Ms. 
O’Rourke’s class. 
Taniya wrote, ‘‘I want to be able to 
go to school and earn my education 
without the fear of possibly not mak-
ing it back home because of the color 
of my skin.’’ 
NasZair describes feeling vulnerable 
because he is Black and worries, ‘‘Will 
my family be safe when we go to the 
supermarkets?’’ 
Journey says, ‘‘I am 13 years old. It is 
unfair for a middle schooler to regu-
larly think about these things.’’ She 
asks, ‘‘What will you do and the gov-
ernment do to stop these attacks?’’ 
Brianna pleads, ‘‘I want someone to 
do something. I want the government 
to do their job. Too many mass shoot-
ings happened in such a small amount 
of time.’’ 
For students and families in Buffalo 
and other communities forever changed 
by mass shootings, now is the time for 
Congress to do its job and take action 
to end gun violence.

ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Democratic Caucus, I 
offer a privileged resolution and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1173 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
bers be, and are hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committees of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE: Ms. Davids of 
Kansas. 
COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS: Mr. Peters. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRA-
STRUCTURE: Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick. 
Mr. JEFFRIES (during the reading). 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be considered 
as read and printed in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from New 
York? 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PROTECTION FOR SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
after three unanimous consent requests 
of mine that were blocked, Congress 
will finally vote to provide Supreme 
Court Justices and their families with 
more security. 
I am glad this bill is coming to the 
floor as is. The Senate passed it unani-
mously, 100–0, more than a month ago. 
Madam Speaker, the House Democrats 
have delayed it for more than a month. 
The question the American public 
asks is why? Why would you delay it? 
We have all known that additional 
security has been necessary since the 
Dobbs opinion was leaked last month. 
Justice Kavanaugh was targeted by an 
armed and dangerous man who flew 
clear across the country to kill him. He 
had zip ties. He had a plan. 
Far-left groups have plans to target 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett and her 
children. They put out where their 
children go to school. But Congress 
kept it here for a month—for a month. 
These unnecessary delays put the safe-
ty of the Justices and their families in 
danger. 
By passing the bill as is, we are send-
ing a clear message to the leftwing 
radicals: You cannot intimidate the 
Supreme Court Justices. I hope we all 
take that message to heart. 
How can we forget what Senator 
SCHUMER said? He didn’t just say it—he 
screamed it—on the steps of the Su-
preme Court. ‘‘You will pay the price. 
You won’t know what hit you if you go 
forward with these awful decisions.’’ 
I don’t know what he meant by, ‘‘You 
will pay the price,’’ because the Su-
preme Court Justices aren’t up for an 
election. It couldn’t be that they would 
lose at the polls. They are lifetime ap-
pointments. 
Now, I don’t know if that young man 
who came all the way from California 
to kill a Justice, if that is what he 
thought SCHUMER was saying, but what 
was he saying, ‘‘You will pay the 
price’’? 
I hope Senator SCHUMER understands 
that his words have consequences. I be-
lieve he should apologize for contrib-
uting to this heated climate. 
With that said, again, I am glad this 
bill is finally coming to the floor. It 
should not have been this hard or 
taken this long. Every single person in 
the Senate voted for it: Republican, 
Democrat, Independent. It sat here for 
a whole month. Even though we came

to the floor and asked for unanimous 
consent to bring it forward, we were 
denied. 
It should not have taken a threat 
against Justice Kavanaugh to force ac-
tion, a threat that even Speaker 
PELOSI
dismissed in her press con-
ference. She said, ‘‘Everybody will be 
fine.’’ 
But at the end of the day, this is the 
better bill, and I am glad it will be 
heading to the President’s desk with-
out any poison pills to ping it back to 
the Senate, to delay it further. This is 
a big victory. 
Now, let’s work to defend our justice 
system for everyone by upholding the 
rule of law which is under attack daily 
in our cities. We can’t uphold the rule 
of law when there is looting, when cit-
ies and police stations are being burned 
down, when criminals are coddled in-
stead of locked up. 
Now that this Congress has come to-
gether 
to 
condemn 
intimidation 
against Supreme Court Justices, let’s 
take the next step to keep America 
safe. Let’s support our police, not 
defund them. Let’s enforce all the laws 
on the books like the law that pro-
hibits 
protesting 
outside 
Justices’ 
homes. Even President Biden encour-
aged people to do that. 
Let’s get tough on crime so that 
every American can feel safe in their 
homes and in their communities. Just 
in my home State, back in the home 
city of our Speaker, San Francisco, the 
people had a big voice. They have just 
recalled their district attorney because 
of crime. 
It is not for me to give any political 
advice to the other side of the aisle, 
but if you want to know what the Re-
publican registration in San Francisco 
is, it is 6.8 percent. I think your mes-
sage of defunding the police by this 
majority party, and I think your mes-
sage of not upholding the law, the 
American public doesn’t want that. 
They want to feel safe, just as a Su-
preme Court Justice does. They want 
to be able to go do their jobs and not 
feel they are being intimidated. 
Let’s get tough on crime. We want 
the American public to feel safe in 
their homes and their communities. 
They want to feel safe. Those are the 
things that would create a safer, 
stronger America, just like we had be-
fore. 
I will make this one promise. If 
Democrats don’t do it during this Con-
gress, I promise you we will in the next 
Congress, because there is definitely 
going to be a change.

SERGEANTS MAJOR ACADEMY 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 50th anni-
versary of the founding of the United 
States Sergeants Major Academy. 
Fort Bliss is the home to the Ser-
geants Major Academy that trains our 
military leaders to address our coun-
try’s challenges. Since 1972, the acad-
emy has expanded students’ strategic 
level of thinking to become capable to 
address large-scale combat operations. 
At the end of the academy, leaders 
leave as agile, adaptive senior leaders 
with the character, competence, and 
commitment to be effective leaders. 
I am proud that my office’s veterans’ 
caseworker, Sergeant Major Benito 
Torres, graduated from the academy in 
2009. 
I commend the continuous education 
that the academy provides and their 
dedication for our military to be ready 
for future challenges. Please join me in 
recognizing the accomplishments of 
the last 50 years of the United States 
Sergeants Major Academy and wish 
them continued growth and success.

CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL 
SHOOTING ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Five years 
ago today, the Republican baseball 
team took to the field for their regular 
morning practice. That morning took a 
dark turn when the team suddenly be-
came a target of a BERNIE SANDERS’ 
supporter with an agenda to shoot and 
kill Republicans. 
It could have been the worst political 
massacre in American history, but we 
are alive today, thanks to those brave 
and honorable law enforcement officers 
who were at the field that day and will-
ing to sacrifice themselves to protect 
us. 
Every day, I wear this wristband 
stamped with the date of the shooting 
and the words, ‘‘In God We Trust’’ to 
remember the angels watching over us 
on that life-changing morning. It is a 
testament to that day, always living in 
our hearts and our minds. 
There is no doubt that without quick 
action of Special Agents Griner and 
Bailey, along with the Alexandria Po-
lice Department, the team would not 
be here today. We forever owe a debt of 
gratitude to our law enforcement and 
our first responders who acted swiftly 
to take down the gunman and simply 
save our lives. 
In God We Trust.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SHERIFF 
JOHN O’BRIEN 
(Mr. SCHRADER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to former 
Sheriff John O’Brien, who passed away 
on June 1 at the age of 74. John was a 
beloved fixture of the Lincoln County 
community in my district, where he 
was known for his dedication to the 
people he served. 
A dedicated Oregon State Beaver, 
after graduating from OSU, John was 
drafted in the U.S. Army in 1970, and 
served in Vietnam where he earned a 
Vietnam Service Medal and Bronze 
Star. He returned home and joined the 
Lincoln County Sheriff’s office as a pa-
trol deputy in 1973. It was here that 
John would find his calling, serving his 
community and the department for 30 
years, the last 9 as sheriff, until his re-
tirement in 2003. After retiring from 
the Sheriff’s office, John worked for 
the Pacific Northwest region of FEMA, 
assisting with disasters in Oregon, 
Alaska, Washington, and New York 
City. 
All who were close to John could at-
test that he cared about people in an 
extraordinary way. His generous spirit 
touched everyone in his life. John dedi-
cated his time to making life better for 
those he served. He will be missed by 
all who knew him. 
He is survived by his wife of 50 years, 
Priscilla, as well as his kids, Eric and 
Erin, and his four grandchildren. I hope 
they can all find peace during this dif-
ficult time as well as mourn the loss of 
an extraordinary member of this great 
family.

BIDEN GAS PRICES BURDEN 
FAMILIES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, sadly, inflation has 
increased to over 8 percent, the highest 
rate in over 40 years. Now family budg-
ets are draining at the pump. 
The over $5 per gallon for gas is the 
highest ever, caused by failing Biden 
policies. The American Energy Alli-
ance with Stephen Moore on the Un-
leash Prosperity Hotline has identified 
over 100 initiatives enacted by Biden to 
restrict American oil and gas develop-
ment. 
When Biden took office, gas was $2.39 
a gallon. Now it has doubled. These ex-
tremist policies intentionally discour-
age gas usage without alternatives 
available to families. Declaring war on 
American energy subsidizes war crimi-
nal Putin’s mass murder in Ukraine 
and allows Iran to proceed with nuclear 
weapons to fulfill ‘‘Death to Israel. 
Death to America.’’ 
America needs price relief through an 
all-of-the-above energy policy achieved 
by President Donald Trump. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who have successfully protected Amer-
ica for 20 years in the global war on 
terrorism as it continues moving from 
the Afghanistan safe haven to America. 
Happy birthday, Donald Trump.

YET ANOTHER TRUCKING CRISIS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, as 
we endure more and more of the Biden- 
induced energy crisis in this country, I 
have to point out another aspect of 
that which is very important that we 
get a handle on soon. Our ability for 
our trucks to deliver the goods, the 
products we expect to be in the stores, 
is going to be hampered even more not 
just in my home State of California $7 
diesel or $6 in the rest of the country, 
and the ability to get truck drivers, 
but also, interestingly enough, there is 
a product called diesel exhaust fluid 
that is part of the newer truck engines 
that is going to run out. 
It is already in short supply. The 
railroads are having a hard time ship-
ping it. It is not even produced enough 
in this country. We have to rely on one 
important component, urea, that the 
major exporters of it are China, Russia, 
and Qatar. We are going to run out of 
the DEF that you put in the trucks. 
The trucks will not run without it be-
cause the computers will not let the 
truck run without this fluid, which is a 
component in the diesel exhaust sys-
tem. 
If we run out of DEF, the trucks 
can’t move, and they will not move the 
products you need, your food, your 
other supplies to the stores for you to 
purchase. So we have yet another crisis 
within a crisis if we run out of DEF. 
DEF needs to be produced in this coun-
try. We need to produce the urea in 
this country. 
f 
FENTANYL CRISIS DESERVES 
URGENCY 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, 
last 
year 
alone 
fentanyl 
killed more Americans than any weap-
on of mass destruction in our Nation’s 
history. 
Fentanyl is now the number one 
cause of death for Americans between 
the ages of 18 and 45. It is not guns. It 
is not COVID–19. It is not even car ac-
cidents. It is fentanyl. 
CDC numbers show more total drug 
overdose deaths last year in the U.S. 
than those killed by the atomic bomb 
blast that ended World War II. 
The direct cause of so many Amer-
ican deaths from fentanyl is the Biden 
administration’s 
surrender 
on 
our 
southern border. In 2021 alone, more 
than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl was 
seized at our southern border. So just 
imagine how much fentanyl got across 
the border and into our communities. 
Fentanyl is a drug so deadly poi-
sonous that the Russian military has 
reportedly weaponized it. Countless 
families who have lost loved ones to 
fentanyl deserve better than what we 
are getting from this administration. 
That is why I cosponsored Congress-
woman BOEBERT’s Fentanyl is a WMD 
Act, a designation that follows the 2019 
proposal from the Trump administra-
tion that would enable our government 
to treat the fentanyl crisis with the ur-
gency that it deserves. 
We can’t turn the other way as the 
Mexican drug cartels kill thousands of 
young Americans. We must take the 
fentanyl threat seriously, and we must 
secure our border.

objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 4160, the Supreme Court Police Par-
ity Act of 2022. 
While the Supreme Court police force 
is currently authorized to provide pro-
tection to the Justices of the Supreme 
Court, this bill would unequivocally ex-
tend their authority to provide protec-
tion to family members of Justices if 
there is reason to believe they are at 
risk. 
It is imperative that the Justices are 
free from fear of violence or physical 
intimidation to make decisions based 
on the Constitution and law as applied 
to the facts of the cases before them. 
This is essential to the rule of law. As-
sailants like the man arrested recently 
for allegedly plotting against the life 
of one of our Justices are a threat to 
our democracy, but with the right se-
curity, they can also be stopped before 
they inflict harm. 
I thank Senators COONS and CORNYN 
for their work on this issue in the Sen-
ate, 
and 
Representatives 
STANTON, 
CORREA, and ISSA for their work in the 
House, likewise introducing bills that 
would extend protection to the families 
of Justices. I also thank Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE as well. 
I further note that Mr. STANTON’s bill 
would have also extended protection to 
the families of Court employees. We 
understand that there was Republican 
opposition to that aspect of the bill, 
and in the interest of protecting the 
Justices’ families, we could no longer 
delay in passing the only version of the 
bill they would apparently agree to. 
But I hope we will swiftly move an-
other bill to extend protection to fami-
lies of employees as well. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
passing this straightforward measure 
to ensure that the families of Supreme 
Court Justices have the necessary pro-
tection from any threats they may 
face. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, why did it take so 
long? Why did it take so long to bring 
this legislation to the floor? It has 
been over a month since the leak of the 
draft opinion, over a month of threats 
on Supreme Court Justices and their 
families, over a month of protests at 
their homes. Why did it take so long? I 
mean, the protests at their homes are a 
direct violation of the law, 18 U.S.C. 
section 1507. Over a month. 
It has been over a week, or actually 
a week, since an assassination attempt 
on a Supreme Court Justice, on Justice

Kavanaugh. Think about that for a sec-
ond. An assassination attempt on a sit-
ting United States Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
And what did the Speaker of the 
House say last week? No one is in dan-
ger. No rush on this legislation. No 
concern here. 
The Senate passed this bill a month 
ago. Why hasn’t the House? Why did it 
take so long? I think the answer is ob-
vious. Because they have always want-
ed to intimidate the Court. That has 
been their goal since the get-go. Their 
goal was to intimidate the Court. That 
has been their objective all along. 
Think about the history first. We had 
the 
Kavanaugh 
confirmation 
mess 
where the left has made up things 
about Justice Kavanaugh and his fam-
ily. Then we had the leader of the Sen-
ate, the Democrat leader of the Senate 
on the Supreme Court steps say to two 
Justices, 
Mr. 
Kavanaugh 
and 
Mr. 
Gorsuch: You have released the whirl-
wind, and you will pay the price. 
Last April, the Democrat chair of the 
Judiciary Committee introduced legis-
lation to do what? To pack the Court, 
to add four Associate Justices to the 
United States Supreme Court. Why 
four? Why not one? Why not two? Why 
not three? Why four? Because four 
would give them a majority on the 
Court. 
Then there was the sustained attack 
on Justice Thomas and his wife over 
the last several weeks. The Democrats 
on the Judiciary Committee even had 
hearings about Justice Thomas. 
Then, of course, there was the leak of 
the draft opinion itself, something that 
has never happened. And then there 
were the protests at Supreme Court 
Justices’ homes, again in direct viola-
tion of the statute. 
And then, finally, there was the hear-
ing the Democrats had in the Judiciary 
Committee about the abortion issue 
while the Dobbs decision is pending in 
front of the Court. You remember that 
hearing. That was the one where the 
Democrat witness said men could get 
pregnant. That is the history here. 
And then, of course, last week, we 
had an assassination attempt on Jus-
tice Kavanaugh. Intimidation is their 
goal. It is the same reason the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security stood up 
the Disinformation Governance Board. 
It is the same reason the Department 
of Justice is targeting parents who 
have the nerve to show up at a school 
board meeting and speak up for their 
kids. It is all about intimidation. That 
is how the left operates, and we have 
seen it play out now against the Su-
preme Court. 
But the good news is, finally, this bill 
is going to pass and give the Justices of 
the highest Court in our land the pro-
tection they and their families deserve. 
I say better late than never. We sup-
port this legislation. It should have 
passed a darn long time ago. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, let me 
tell you why it took us a few weeks 
rather than just 1 week to pass this 
legislation. It is because Republicans 
refused to protect the families of Su-
preme Court employees who are at 
risk. Shame on you for not doing that. 
And, by the way, there are threats to 
Justices across the board. I support 
this legislation. I just note that re-
cently there was an article on CNN ti-
tled ‘‘Justice Sonia Sotomayor was 
targeted by gunman, Federal judge 
tells ‘60 Minutes,’ ’’ dated February 19, 
2021. Intimidation goes on both sides. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, that 
is why Republicans have condemned vi-
olence every single time it happened. 
We condemned it when it happened on 
January 6. But guess what? We also 
condemned it when it happened in the 
summer of 2020. 
It hasn’t been a few weeks since the 
leak of the draft opinion. It has been 6 
weeks. The Senate passed this legisla-
tion unanimously, and they wouldn’t 
bring it up. They wouldn’t bring it up. 
In fact, the Speaker of the House, as I 
said before, the Speaker of the House 
said last week there was no need to 
bring it up, but now we are going to. 
Thank goodness for that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA), my friend. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, listening 
to the initial debate here, you would 
believe that there was a legitimate dif-
ference of opinion here on the floor 
about protecting the Justices. Clearly, 
there was no such difference in the U.S. 
Senate. What there is, though, is a 
story that I think needs to be told. 
b 1230 
When I authored this legislation a 
month ago, I knew that we had support 
in the Senate, and I knew that we 
would have support in the House. The 
first thing I did was I called up the 
most senior member of the Judiciary 
Committee on the other side of the 
aisle and said to him that I believe we 
should do this. He agreed. Not checking 
with staff, he agreed to this simple bill 
of protecting those who would be in-
timidated and those who would be 
threatened and those whose lives could 
not be replaced in a timely fashion 
without changing the outcome of the 
Court. And that was it; I had my co-
sponsor. 
A day later, mysteriously, another 
bill, very different, was dropped in the 
hopper by the Speaker’s staff. It was 
done so without a Republican cospon-
sor, without a call to the ranking 
member who stands here today. That 
was done because they wanted to play 
message with it. They wanted to delay, 
and the Speaker has delayed for a 
month. 
Madam Speaker, 18 U.S.C. 1507 is not 
a suggestion that you prevent intimi-
dation of the Court. It is a law. It is a 
law that the President of the United 
States 
has 
sworn 
to 
uphold 
and, 
through his Attorney General, has not, 
has negated the responsibility. 
This legislation is not only essential 
to protect against another assassina-
tion attempt of a Justice or their fam-
ily, but it is even more important be-
cause this administration, as we speak, 
is not obeying the law that they have 
sworn to obey, one that the Attorney 
General is required to. So, it is a dou-
ble-edged sword that I come with 
today. 
Democrats took 30 days and waited a 
week after the attempted assassination 
of a Supreme Court Justice before they 
would bring a commonsense, non-
controversial piece of legislation to the 
floor. I applaud all of those who will 
vote for it today, and I suspect that it 
will be voted for unanimously here on 
the floor. 
But justice delayed, or protection of 
our Justice delayed, could have led to 
the death of a Justice and, even as we 
speak, still could. 
Let’s pass it. Let’s pass it without 
further controversy. And let’s never 
again do something as shameful as ig-
nore the law and delay protection of 
people who are being intimidated. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The Republicans are misleading you. 
Supreme Court Justices already have 
protection. Let me say that again. Su-
preme Court Justices already have pro-
tection. 
This is about families of Supreme 
Court Justices, which I support them 
having protection, and Democrats are 
fighting for families of law clerks and 
employees of the Supreme Court. They 
should have protection, too. 
Let me tell you the threats to em-
ployees of the Supreme Court. Soon 
after the draft decision leaked, a right-
wing activist posted the personal de-
tails of a law clerk who he baselessly 
claimed had leaked Justice Alito’s 
draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. 
This rightwing activist even posted the 
clerk’s wedding announcement and sin-
gled out the clerk’s spouse. Repub-
licans don’t want to protect that per-
son or their family. 
After another Republican strategist 
claimed a different law clerk had 
leaked the opinion, an extremist anti- 
abortion rights group issued a press re-
lease targeting that clerk and the Jus-
tice the clerk worked for. The author 
of the press release had served years in 
prison for conspiring to blow up an 
abortion clinic. Referring to the people 
in the Justice’s office, the group’s lead-
er said that he could smell their fear. 
Republicans don’t want to protect 
the families of Supreme Court employ-
ees. Shame on them. 
Recently, a news outlet obtained a 
DHS intelligence report identifying 
threats to murder Justices and their 
clerks. Why don’t Republicans want to 
protect the families of Supreme Court 
employees? 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5497 
June 14, 2022 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, unfortunately, this bill is necessary 
because we have a radical and unhinged 
leftwing activist group of individuals 
that also have been encouraged by the 
slow-walking 
Democratic 
Party 
in 
hopes of intimidation being used to in-
fluence the courts. That is why we are 
here today. 
We have assassination attempts on 
Judge Kavanaugh. We have fire bomb-
ings of women’s resource centers and 
healthcare facilities. We have U.S. Sen-
ators, sitting U.S. Senators, encour-
aging violence against the children and 
families of Supreme Court Justices. 
Ever since the leak took place some 
6 weeks ago, there have been at least 14 
coordinated attacks on women’s preg-
nancy care facilities, and Democratic 
leadership has endorsed and encour-
aged physical threats to their political 
opposition. This is totally unaccept-
able. It is un-American. 
The unhinged left is not the party 
that empowers women. If that were 
true, they would not be trying to de-
stroy women’s resource centers, nor 
would they be trying to attack and in-
timidate those who work there. They 
would not be threatening the life of 
and encouraging violence toward the 
children of the fourth woman to serve 
on the United States Supreme Court. 
The protests that have been taking 
place outside the Justices’ homes this 
past month are unacceptable, and 
Democratic leadership has refused to 
condemn the threats of violence. 
One great example of this is, despite 
the law and the prohibition against 
such protests, Jen Psaki, while she was 
White House press secretary, stated: 
‘‘. . . we certainly continue to encour-
age that outside of judges’ homes, and 
that is the President’s position.’’ 
This is the position of the Demo-
cratic Party: intimidation and fear. 
Now it is getting out of control. It is 
about time the Democrats are coming 
to admit it. I encourage my colleagues 
to support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the Sen-
ate or its Members. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, Su-
preme Court Justices are already pro-
tected. Really? Really? They are al-
ready protected? 
The Speaker said no one is in danger, 
no one is in danger after an assassina-
tion attempt. I don’t know if I would 
feel very protected. On the very day of 
the assassination attempt, in violation 
of the law, protesters are at the very 
house of the Supreme Court Justice 
being intimidated by protesters. 
The Speaker says that no one is in 
danger. I don’t want to engage in per-
sonalities, so I might say a high-rank-
ing official on the other side of the 
Capitol here said: You have released 
the whirlwind; you don’t know what 
will hit you. And then down the street, 
Pennsylvania Avenue, a high-ranking 
official said there might be a mini-rev-
olution. 
Does that not sound like intimida-
tion to you? It sure sounds like it to 
me. I don’t know what my friends on 
the other side of the aisle want to hap-
pen. I don’t know. I am not in their 
heads, and I am not in their hearts. But 
I listen to what they say, and I watch 
what they do. We should have passed 
this much longer ago when it was 
available to us, and the fact that we 
didn’t might be the cause for people to 
come to assassinate a United States 
Supreme Court Justice. 
This is not a third-world country. If 
you don’t get your way, you don’t blow 
up the Court and kill the Justices. But, 
apparently, that is what some people in 
America think is appropriate. It is not 
appropriate. I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me say this. Reading from a 
headline here, this group, Ruth Sent 
Us, ‘‘. . . hinted at targeting Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Barrett’s 
children, 
church.’’ Let me read the headline 
here. ‘‘Group gave details on Barrett’s 
routine, her children’s school, and fam-
ily’s spiritual life.’’ 
In plain English, this group was say-
ing where Justice Coney Barrett goes 
each day, where her kids go to school, 
and where her family goes to church. 
They gave those details. 
Last week, the Democrats said no 
one is in danger. After an assassination 
attempt on Justice Barrett’s colleague, 
Justice Kavanaugh, they said not to 
worry. Everything is fine. We don’t 
need to pass this legislation after the 
Senate had done it unanimously. That 
is the position of the Democrats in this 
body. 
That is why we are saying: Why did it 
take so long? Six weeks ago was when 
the draft leak happened, and the pro-
tests started at Justices’ homes almost 
immediately after the leak of that 
draft, that unprecedented leak of that 
draft opinion. They have been doing it 
now for weeks and weeks and weeks. 
Here is the email from this organiza-
tion, this Ruth Sent Us organization. 
Here is one of the messages: ‘‘If you are 
in the D.C. metro area, join us. Our 
protests at Barrett’s home moved the 
needle to this coverage. Falls Church is 
a People of Praise stronghold. She 
sends her seven kids to a People of 
Praise school that she sat on the board 
of directors for. She attends church 
daily,’’ as if that is bad to go to church 
daily. I think that is a good thing. But 
this is what they are saying, this 
group, giving the details of where her 
kids go to school, where they go to 
church, and her daily routine. 
And the Democrats said: Nothing to 
worry about. 
That is our concern. So thank good-
ness this bill is here. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am going to respond to that because 
what he just said is a lie. The fact that 
he is saying Democrats think there is 
nothing wrong, there is no danger to 
Supreme Court Justices, is a lie. Why? 
Because we are the majority party, and 
we just put this bill up, and we are 
about to vote on it. We clearly care 
about Supreme Court Justices. 
But we also care about the families 
and employees of the Supreme Court, 
and that is what we are talking about 
today. Again, I just want to remind 
you, Republicans are misleading you. 
Supreme Court Justices right now have 
law enforcement protection details. 
They are protected by law enforce-
ment. This bill has to do with the fami-
lies of Supreme Court Justices. I sup-
port protecting them. I also support 
protecting the employees and their 
families of the Supreme Court. 
That is the dispute. The Democrats 
want to also protect the employees and 
families who are getting threats from 
rightwing activists, intimidation from 
the far right. 
Do you want to talk about intimida-
tion? I will tell you what intimidation 
is. It is Trump supporters assaulting 
the Capitol on January 6, brutalizing 
140 police officers. That is intimida-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We condemned what took place on 
January 6. It would have been nice if 
Democrats would have done the same 
thing in the summer of 2020 or passed 
this legislation 6 weeks ago or a month 
ago when the Senate passed it. 
Let me just recite a few things here 
that have been said by our colleagues 
on the other side. 
Former Attorney General Eric Hold-
er said in 2018, at a campaign event in 
Georgia, to kick Republicans. ‘‘No. No. 
When they go low, we kick them.’’ 
That is what this new Democratic 
Party is about. 
It sure is. It is all about intimida-
tion: intimidating the court, intimi-
dating parents who have the nerve to 
show up at school board meetings, set-
ting up a Disinformation Governance 
Board to intimidate free speech rights 
of all Americans. That is what the new 
Democratic Party is about. 
We have seen it time and time again. 
In the summer of 2018, we saw one of 
our colleagues from California, a Dem-
ocrat Member, say: Let’s make sure we 
show up wherever we have to show up. 
And if you see anybody from the 
Trump Cabinet in a restaurant, in a de-
partment store, at a gasoline station, 
out in a crowd, you create a crowd and 
push back on them, and you tell 
them—think about this. This is a Mem-
ber of Congress saying this to a Cabi-
net member—you tell them they are

not welcome anymore, anywhere. A 
Cabinet member of the administration 
not welcome in their own darn coun-
try? That is what a Member of Con-
gress said on the Democrat side. 
We had another Member of Congress 
on the Democrat side say this: There 
needs to be ‘‘unrest on the streets,’’ 
calling for unrest on the streets while 
there was unrest on the streets in the 
summer of 2020. 
That is why this legislation is so 
darn important and why we cannot fig-
ure out—the gentleman just said some-
thing that wasn’t accurate. The Speak-
er of the House last week said no one is 
in danger. I just read you what they 
are posting about Justice Coney Bar-
rett and her family and where they go 
to church and where her seven kids go 
to school. Of course, this is in the con-
text of everything they have done to 
intimidate the Court and an assassina-
tion attempt on another Justice, Jus-
tice Kavanaugh. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
b 1245 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Ohio for yielding. 
I have missed most of the debate on 
the floor. Mr. JORDAN just made ref-
erence to an item that bowls me over. 
You wonder after you have been in 
Washington for a little while whether 
anything 
will 
surprise 
you. 
Yes, 
Madam Speaker, that tweet by the pro- 
abortion group, Ruth Sent Us, that 
identified Justice Barrett’s church and 
identified the school that her children 
attend and encouraged protestors to 
‘‘voice your anger’’ by demonstrating 
there, is a new low. 
Not just the identification of Jus-
tices’ home addresses, which I never 
thought we would see, not just the 
crowds materializing there, which I 
never thought we would see, not just 
the appearance of an assassin at the 
home of a Justice, which we have never 
seen, and yet, the response is: What 
about January 6? 
As the gentleman from Ohio made 
the point, I have never encountered 
any Republican who declined to con-
demn the violence and rioting at the 
Capitol that day. I have never found 
one. I have never heard one. And yet, I 
never hear condemnation of such con-
duct as I have described from Demo-
crats. I might be missing it. I am not 
hearing it now. I am hearing this, What 
about January 6? 
I condemn the rioting and the vio-
lence at the Capitol on January 6. 
I condemn the Democrat leader of 
the Senate standing in front of the Su-
preme Court to say to two specific Jus-
tices that, You have released the whirl-
wind. You will suffer the result. I don’t 
remember the exact words. And then 
what I do remember, the phrase that 
sticks in my mind: ‘‘You won’t know 
what hit you if you go forward with 
these awful decisions.’’ I never hear 
condemnation for that. I don’t know 
why. 
I do think I know why this bill had to 
be delayed from last week when we 
were here and could have passed it. 
That is because you want to protect 
the leaker. That implies that although 
this has been pending for a month and 
a half and the Nation doesn’t know who 
the leaker is, somebody knows who the 
leaker is; and that is who you want to 
protect, amazing as that is, unprece-
dented as that is. 
We certainly ought to pass this legis-
lation and protect the Justices of the 
United States Supreme Court from as-
sassins, assassins responding to the un-
precedented advocacy on the left. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I condemn violence whether it is 
from rightwing groups or leftwing 
groups or white supremacist groups or 
any other group. Democrats say this 
all the time. 
I will tell you why Republicans don’t 
hear it. Because they are in their bub-
ble watching just Fox News, who won’t 
even show the January 6 hearings. 
That is why they don’t hear any of this 
stuff because it is never played to them 
or their base. Democrats condemn vio-
lence all the time. 
By the way, last year—I am just 
going to tell you the headline of this 
article 
again: 
‘‘Justice 
Sonia 
Sotomayor was targeted by gunmen 
. . .’’ Did Republicans jump up in out-
rage? No, no, they didn’t. 
So let’s just be clear here what we 
are talking about today, once again: 
Supreme Court Justices get law en-
forcement protection right now, as we 
speak. 
This is actually a dispute about em-
ployees. So I am going to ask Repub-
licans a question, and I bet you they 
will not answer it: Why do they not 
want to protect the employees and 
their families of the Supreme Court? 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
employees of the Supreme Court are al-
ready protected. This is about pro-
tecting the Justices’ families, and we 
know that is needed based on the head-
line I read and the email that Mr. 
BISHOP just talked about. 
The gentleman said that Democrats 
condemn violence. No, they don’t. No, 
they don’t. They called rioters and 
looters the entire summer of 2020, they 
called them ‘‘peaceful protestors.’’ And 
that same summer, then-Senator now- 
Vice President HARRIS raised money to 
bail those rioters and looters and peo-
ple who went after the police out of 
jail. So you have got to stick with the 
facts here, and that is just not accu-
rate what was stated earlier. 
For all the reasons we have high-
lighted, Madam Speaker, we are glad 
this bill is finally going to pass. We 
just wish it would have happened when 
it should have, weeks and weeks ago 
when this threat was first present for 
Supreme Court Justices. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, it is 
incredible to stand here and listen to 
our Republican colleagues talk about 
the risks and the dangers that exist to 
the Supreme Court. 
I want to know where they were 
when the risks and the dangers existed 
for my community, El Paso, Texas, 
where 23 innocent people were slaugh-
tered by a white supremacist with an 
AK–47? Where were they then? How 
about Uvalde? Where were they then? 
How about every other mass shooting? 
Buffalo? You name it. 
Last week, we brought to the floor 
legislation intended to protect millions 
of Americans, especially and including 
children. The vast majority of our Re-
publican 
colleagues 
voted 
against 
those protections for vulnerable people 
who don’t have access to 24-hour, 
round-the-clock U.S. Marshal protec-
tion. They don’t have access to round- 
the-clock, 24/7 Capitol Police protec-
tion, which Supreme Court Justices 
have today. Supreme Court Justices 
have far more protections than Mem-
bers of Congress do, but more impor-
tantly they have more than those inno-
cent lives that were taken in innumer-
able cities across America. 
And as they rail about and clutch 
their pearls over the fact that it took 
House Democrats some time to get this 
bill to the floor, the reason it took that 
much time is because it was House 
Democrats that at least wanted to get 
one itty-bitty concession out of this 
bill to protect the staff of that institu-
tion, the United States Supreme Court. 
But they refused. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I re-
mind the American public why they 
brought this bill to the floor, both in 
the Senate and here; it is a talking 
point. It is not because it really does 
anything, it is simply a talking point. 
It came as a result of a leaked decision 
on the Justices’ desire to take away 
women’s reproductive care. 
Guess who else doesn’t get protec-
tions in America the way that they 
would like to protect others? It is 
those healthcare providers and patients 
and staff who are vulnerable every day, 
especially because of the actions of the 
Supreme Court. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, a 
talking point? The left is telling people 
where Justice Barrett’s kids go to 
school. That is not a talking point, 
that is a fact. That is one of the 
craziest things I have heard said on 
this floor. 
A talking point? Every single Sen-
ator voted for this package. That in-
cludes Democrats. Every single one. 
A talking point? You have got to be 
kidding me.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 14, 2022 
They are reporting where a Supreme 
Court Justice’s kids go to school, 
where her family goes to church, her 
daily routine, and the left calls it a 
talking point? 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, S. 4160 is 
a straightforward bill that will protect 
the families of the Justices. Democrats 
also fought to try to protect the fami-
lies of Supreme Court employees. Re-
publicans objected and won’t do that, 
so this is the best we can get. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LIEU) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 4160. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the debate 
only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
b 1300 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
1170, for three measures. 
First, it provides for consideration of 
H.R. 2543 under a structured rule. The 
rule self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment, provides 1 hour of general debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services, makes in 
order 27 amendments, and provides one 
motion to recommit. 
Second, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 2773 under a structured 
rule. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment, provides 1 hour of 
general debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and the ranking 
member of the Committee on Natural 
Resources, 
makes 
in 
order 
eight 
amendments, and provides one motion 
to recommit. 
Third, the rule provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 7606 under a structured 
rule. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment, provides 1 hour of 
general debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Agriculture, 
makes in order two amendments, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same day authority through June 22, 
2022. 
First, I will say a few words about 
the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act. 
Times are tough for working families 
across our country. Food prices are ris-
ing and gas prices are at an all-time 
high. At the same time, food companies 
and Big Oil are making record profits 
at the expense of these same hard-
working Americans. 
Costs are rising up and down the sup-
ply chain. The cost of fertilizer and 
pesticides has risen 50 percent over the 
past year, in part due to the ongoing 
war in Ukraine. Rising energy prices, 
increasing trucking costs, and the 
worst outbreak of avian flu in 7 years 
are all contributing to the higher 
prices consumers are paying at the gro-
cery store. 
Plus, combine oil companies’ irre-
sponsibility 
with 
Putin’s 
war 
in 
Ukraine, and you have an unbearable 
situation for American consumers. The 
Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act will 
help us look out for working families, 
not just big corporations and their bil-
lionaire CEOs. This package of bipar-
tisan legislation supports farmers and 
lowers prices for America’s families at 
the grocery store and at the gas pump. 
This rule also allows us to consider a 
package of legislation aimed at ad-
dressing racial and economic inequities 
that limit opportunities for Americans 
to buy homes, access loans, and earn 
fair wages. 
Income and wealth inequality is 
higher in the United States than in any 
other developed country, and there are 
examples of it in almost all parts of 
our lives. The reforms in this package 
will help us better target and measure 
outcomes for underserved populations. 
Finally, the Recovering America’s 
Wildlife Act helps protect the more 
than one-third of all fish and wildlife 
species in the United States that are at 
risk of extinction. 
This legislation funds conservation 
efforts for more than 12,000 species of 
wildlife and plants, and the recovery of 
1,600 species already listed as threat-
ened or endangered. 
Taken together and taken sepa-
rately, these bills will all lead to real 
important change for Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman from California for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
provides for consideration of three 
pieces of legislation that are, once 
again, missed opportunities to provide 
real relief to the American people. 
Rather than working with Repub-
licans to address the serious issues fac-
ing 
our 
Nation, 
Democrats 
again 
prioritize the interests of far-left spe-
cial interest groups and their radical 
progressive base over the needs of 
American workers and American fami-
lies. 
Look no further than H.R. 2543, a 
compilation of 13 Committee on Finan-
cial Services’ bills that prioritize woke 
policies and unnecessary reporting over 
actually fixing Biden’s economic crisis. 
As my friends across the aisle will re-
member, under President Trump, U.S. 
employment reached a 50-year low of 
3.5 percent. Additionally, under Presi-
dent Trump, minority unemployment 
dropped to the lowest levels on record. 
Compare that with the economy 
under the Democrats’ one-party rule. 
Inflation is now at a 40-year high. Gas 
prices are now over $5 a gallon. Ameri-
cans can expect to pay an extra $5,200 
this year compared to last year for the 
same goods and services. 
Once again, rather than just working 
with Republicans to provide real eco-
nomic relief, the Democrats continue 
to double down on reckless spending, 
far-left policies, and have prioritized 
their Big Government socialism over 
free market principles. What has this 
led to? 
It has led to economic instability. It 
threatens the stability of our Federal 
Reserve. It piles regulatory costs on 
small 
businesses. 
It 
emboldens 
unelected and unaccountable career 
bureaucrats. 
Ultimately, H.R. 2543 will make it 
more difficult for low-income and mi-
nority borrowers to start a business, to 
buy a home, and to build credit. It ac-
tually does the opposite of the intended 
effect. 
This will also provide for consider-
ation of H.R. 7606, a bill that claims to 
lower food costs by appointing a ‘‘spe-
cial investigator,’’ and this special in-
vestigator will investigate American 
meat packers and live poultry dealers. 
Let’s be clear, this legislation is a 
weak attempt to lay the blame for 
President Biden’s economic crisis on 
American job creators. In reality, this 
is just another unfunded mandate that 
empowers Washington bureaucrats and 
places new burdens on American food 
producers. 
Alarmingly, these compliance costs 
may actually raise the price of food 
even higher, making life in Joe Biden’s 
America even harder on average Amer-
ican families. 
Finally, this bill provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 2773, the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act of 2022. While I 
support conservation efforts, I am in-
credibly disappointed once again by the 
majority walking away from talks with 
Republicans to find offsets and to try 
to resolve spending concerns for the 
$1.34 billion in new annual mandatory 
spending authorized by this bill. 
In fact, according to the CBO, this 
legislation spends $12.7 billion just in 
the first 10 years alone. 
Madam Speaker, 80 percent of Ameri-
cans say inflation is the most impor-
tant issue facing this country. You 
wouldn’t know it by looking at the 
bills Democrats are prioritizing for 
floor action this week. 
b 1315 
Perhaps it is time that my Big Gov-
ernment, Democratic colleagues actu-
ally listen to the American people and 
work with Republicans on real eco-
nomic solutions rather than doubling 
down on the out-of-control spending 
and reckless far-left policies that cre-
ated Biden’s economic crisis in the 
first place. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ to oppose this 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
always, as we have these debates with 
my good friend from Pennsylvania, en-
courage that we do work together ac-
knowledging that we have differences 
of opinion and reminding people who 
are maybe watching that we are in a 
global economy that has inflation glob-
ally and that what we are doing in this 
package is to try to provide some small 
instruments 
for 
oversight 
account-
ability so that we can have as much 
control as we can in a global economy 
that is impacting this inflation that is 
so hard for working Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5501 
June 14, 2022 
So with all due respect to my friend 
from Pennsylvania, I am always will-
ing to work with him. But this package 
is intended to provide more account-
ability, not more bureaucracy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I hear about this being a glob-
al issue. It is a global issue, but the 
reason it is a global issue—quick eco-
nomics lesson—we are still the reserve 
currency. We also are the largest GDP. 
We are exporting the inflation to other 
countries. 
Let’s be clear. The inflation is caused 
by Joe Biden’s reckless, Big Govern-
ment, socialist agenda and, unfortu-
nately, the American people as well as 
the world have to deal with this reck-
lessness. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), who is my good friend on 
the Rules Committee. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and friend from 
Pennsylvania for yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to start 
off by saying that I am going to specifi-
cally talk about H.R. 7606. Many of the 
bills included in that bill, in H.R. 7606, 
I supported and helped introduce. The 
Butcher Block Act, year-round E–15, 
and the PRECISE Act are all pieces of 
legislation I have long supported and 
are included in this package. 
I find it stunning that my colleagues 
in the majority after many months of 
sitting on these thoughtful, bipartisan 
bills are finally bringing them forward 
attached to a poison pill that is dupli-
cative and unnecessary. 
Perhaps most disappointing is that 
this bill is being advertised as an im-
mediate solution to skyrocketing food 
and fuel prices. But many of these bills 
are simply codifications of existing 
programs or duplicative of other efforts 
all packaged with a feel-good title. 
Let me be clear. These will not ad-
dress the underlying drivers of infla-
tion or increasing input costs. If the 
majority were serious about bringing 
down the cost of our food and fuel, they 
would check their incessant spending 
habits far beyond the Federal Govern-
ment’s means. They would roll back 
the Biden administration’s regulatory 
war on agriculture. 
But that is not what this bill does. 
Madam Speaker, the Packers and 
Stockyards Division already has en-
forcement tools at their disposal to ad-
dress uncompetitive behavior in the 
meatpacking sector. However, by the 
Packers and Stockyards Division’s own 
estimates, the agency is chronically 
understaffed and underfunded. If my 
colleagues were serious about com-
bating uncompetitive behavior in the 
meatpacking 
industry, 
they 
would 
have included robust resources to en-
hance enforcement under the Packers 
and Stockyard Act. 
This legislation is unfunded and cre-
ates an unnecessary and duplicative 
special investigator appointed by an 
administration 
that 
blames 
rising 
costs of goods and services on everyone 
but themselves and is empowered with 
nearly unlimited authority to harass 
market participants when convenient 
for the politics of this administration. 
Further, the Department of Justice 
has already been in the process of in-
vestigating meatpackers with respect 
to this exact issue. 
I would ask my colleague if they 
have yet to receive any update regard-
ing this effort? And if so, what can we 
expect from it? I know many of my Re-
publican colleagues and I have been 
seeking an update for months to no 
avail. Absent such investigation, it is 
inappropriate for this bill to move for-
ward. 
Much of this package does have bi-
partisan support, but when I asked why 
the majority didn’t focus on the bills 
with strong bipartisan consensus, I was 
essentially told that this is the pack-
age, this is what the majority wants. 
The message to me was, Take it or 
leave it. This shows, once again, the 
majority’s unwillingness to work in a 
bipartisan manner and really, really 
address the issues facing Americans. 
That is unfortunate, and I urge my 
colleagues in the majority to work 
with Republicans in addressing these 
issues in a thoughtful and bipartisan 
manner and to stop playing politics 
while our country suffers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this rule and the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Americans are now 
paying an average of over $5 for a gal-
lon of gas. This is the first time in his-
tory this has happened. Let me repeat 
that: over $5 for a gallon of gas. 
The pain at the pump is a direct re-
sult of President Biden’s and congres-
sional Democrats’ radical Green New 
Deal agenda and a war on American en-
ergy producers. 
Let’s just be blunt about something: 
the base of the Democratic Party—the 
bunch of woke yuppies sitting at home 
on Zooms all day—don’t care about gas 
prices. But if you are someone who has 
to swing a hammer for a living and 
drive to a jobsite, if you are a waitress 
at a diner and you have to drive to 
your shift, that affects you. 
Republicans care about working fam-
ilies and working men and women. 
That is why we believe Americans de-
serve affordable, American-made en-
ergy. That is why if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will personally offer 
an amendment to the rule to imme-
diately consider H.R. 6858, the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, here to explain this amend-
ment is my good friend and a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, 
Congressman 
JEFF
DUNCAN 
from South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the previous question 
so that we can amend the rule to im-
mediately 
consider 
H.R. 
6858, 
the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. 
As 
a 
direct 
result 
of 
President 
Biden’s war on American energy, aver-
age national gas prices have hit $5 per 
gallon. I don’t know what they are in 
Michigan. I know I pay more than $5 a 
gallon for diesel fuel in South Carolina. 
This is the worst energy crisis we 
have seen since 1973. Why we had an en-
ergy crisis in the seventies was supply 
and demand. We had lessening global 
supply and increased demand as the 
economy was growing. 
When will we learn? 
The American people are feeling the 
pain directly due to the policies of the 
Biden administration. This shouldn’t 
come as any surprise to the American 
people. It really doesn’t because the 
President said during a Presidential de-
bate that he would phase out oil and 
gas production in the United States, 
and that is exactly what they are 
doing. It is costing moms and dads 
around the country, and Democrats are 
wondering why gas prices are so high. 
It is unbelievable. 
What is even more unbelievable is 
that President Biden killed American 
energy at the same time green-lighting 
Vladimir Putin’s Nord Stream 2 project 
to allow Vladimir Putin to produce en-
ergy and sell it to Europe. We can’t do 
that here at home. 
The logic of Joe Biden and the Demo-
crats: kill American energy while pro-
moting energy development of tyrants 
in Russia, Iran, and Venezuela is unbe-
lievable. 
It is simple. You are playing politics 
with 
this 
country’s 
energy 
crisis. 
Democrats want high gas prices so 
they can push their fallacy of a utopian 
world of wind, solar, and EVs for all. 
Meanwhile, 
American 
families 
are 
choosing between filling up their tank, 
feeding their families, and not doing 
other things they are used to doing be-
cause they are having to pay more at 
the pump. 
Energy prices hurt low-income Amer-
icans the hardest. They are seeing 
their savings erode in a volatile stock 
market. More of their paychecks are 
going for basic commodities due to 
rampant high inflation, and they are 
paying record-high prices nationwide 
to fuel their vehicles.

electric vehicle. They can range up to 
$90,000. 
How many American families can af-
ford that? 
Even 
the 
Biden 
administration 
knows that is a failed approach. 
I saw a Democrat plan recently that 
we are going to use more of the Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve to increase 
supply. Okay. You acknowledge there 
is a supply-and-demand issue. They are 
currently tapping the SPR at record 
levels to meet rising demand. The SPR 
fell to 538 billion barrels just last 
month, and that is the lowest level 
since 1987. 
Madam Speaker, that is a finite com-
modity that once we drain the SPR, 
unless you produce more energy or buy 
oil from Iran, Venezuela, or Russia to 
replenish it—it is not an infinite sup-
ply—what are you going to do then? 
What are we going to do then when 
that runs out? 
If Americans want to blame someone 
for record-high gas prices, then look no 
further than House Democrats who 
have already blocked Representative 
CATHY
MCMORRIS
RODGERS’ bill, the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act, six times. If Democrats 
block it today, then it will be the sev-
enth time they have blocked a com-
monsense piece of legislation that is a 
Republican solution. Now, this bill will 
approve the Keystone XL pipeline, re-
move all restrictions on LNG exports, 
and restart oil and gas leasing on Fed-
eral lands and waters. 
It is well past time for the Democrats 
to wake up and follow the science, as 
they like to say. Stop putting special 
interest groups before the American 
people. 
Let’s flip the switch. Let’s support 
American energy and America first 
policies. Let’s support the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act 
to unleash American energy production 
and security. Let’s take the first step 
toward lowering gas prices for Ameri-
cans and quit playing games. We are 
going to release the SPR oil to increase 
supply to lower the price at the pump 
because that is temporary, because 
once that supply is used up, we are not 
going to have that to put back into the 
market. Quit doing that. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
South Carolina an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. DUNCAN. Flip the switch, folks. 
Let’s support American energy inde-
pendence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question so the House 
can immediately consider this com-
monsense legislation by CATHY MCMOR-
RIS RODGERS. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to re-
mind folks that 50 percent of inflation 
is caused by the war in Ukraine and ac-
tions by Vladimir Putin. In terms of 
energy, we believe in supporting Amer-
ican energy, but we also accept the re-
ality that we are transitioning to more 
choices in energy like we do in Cali-
fornia. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a June 10, 2021, USA Today ar-
ticle titled: ‘‘Fact check: Rising gas 
prices due to high demand and low sup-
ply, not Biden’s policies.’’ 
[From USA Today, June 10, 2021] 
FACT CHECK: RISING GAS PRICES DUE TO HIGH 
DEMAND
AND
LOW
SUPPLY, NOT
BIDEN’S 
POLICIES 
(By Miriam Fauzia) 
THE CLAIM: JOE BIDEN IS TO BLAME FOR HIGHER 
GAS PRICES 
The rising cost of gasoline is being felt 
across the U.S., as the national average price 
has gone up from $2 per gallon last year to $3 
per gallon as of June 9, according to data 
from the American Automobile Association. 
Many on social media claim President Joe 
Biden is to blame for this change. A June 1 
Instagram post put the title ‘‘Joe Biden’s 
America’’ atop a graphic showing the price 
jump from January to May 2021. 
‘‘Man I haven’t seen gas prices this high 
since the last time (a) Democrat was in of-
fice!’’ claims one meme shared to Facebook 
on May 22. 
‘‘It’s called the Biden effect,’’ commented 
one Facebook user under a similar May 18 
Facebook post. Blaming Biden for this up-
tick isn’t a new phenomenon. These claims 
have been in circulation since January and 
particularly allege Biden’s cancellation of 
the Keystone XL pipeline significantly im-
pacted gasoline, ‘‘ensur(ing) a huge increase 
in gas prices for millions of us.’’ USA 
TODAY has reached out to the posters for 
comment. 
While it’s true gasoline prices have risen 
significantly since Biden took office on Jan. 
20 the upward trend predates Biden’s time in 
office and is related to COVID–19 and market 
factors, not who occupies the White House. 
PANDEMIC’S EFFECT ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
As with any commodity, the price of gaso-
line is determined by the simple balance of 
supply and demand: a high supply and low 
demand means low prices, while a low supply 
and high demand mean prices rise. 
The most important driver of this fluctua-
tion is crude oil, from which gasoline is de-
rived. This fossil fuel typically accounts for 
between 50 percent and 60 percent of the 
price at the pump, said Jeanette McGee, a 
spokesperson for AAA. 
In 2020, crude oil prices became extremely 
cheap, so much so it was being traded at neg-
ative prices, McGee told USA TODAY. Brent 
crude oil, for example, a blend supplying 
most of Europe, was being sold at $9 a barrel, 
its lowest price in decades, the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA) reported. 
The primary reason for this drop in crude 
oil prices was the pandemic, said McGee and 
Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice University’s 
Center for Energy Studies. 
‘‘The pandemic drove the world’s oil mar-
ket to become massively oversupplied, in-
ventory dramatically increased and prices 
collapsed,’’ Finley told USA TODAY. 
In response to the low demand due to re-
duced travel and lockdown restrictions, Fin-
ley said major oil-producing countries like 
Russia, Saudi Arabia and member countries 
of the Organization of the Petroleum Export-
ing Countries, or OPEC, decided to cut down 
on their own oil production. But the cut 
meant oil producers weren’t ready to meet 
the demand for crude oil once it renewed this 
year thanks to easing of COVID–19-related 
restrictions. 
‘‘This year, demand has so far increased 
more quickly than production rates, which 
means the United States had to draw more 
on its gasoline storage inventories, which 
has contributed to prices going up,’’ EIA 
spokesperson Chris Higginbotham said in an 
email to USA TODAY. ‘‘We expect oil pro-
ducers in the United States and globally to 
increase their production levels through 2022, 
which we expect to contribute to lower crude 
oil prices, and lower gasoline prices.’’ 
GAS PRICE UPTREND PREDATES BIDEN 
While presidential actions and policies can 
have some impact on the crude oil market, 
they don’t have as much influence over gaso-
line prices as one might think. 
‘‘Some of (a president’s) decisions can im-
pact or contribute to market changes, which 
can then impact (future) crude oil, but they 
don’t dictate gas prices,’’ said McGee. ‘‘If 
you go back and look at historical data, 
whether it was Bush, Obama, Trump or 
Biden, (gas prices) go up and down no matter 
who’s in office.’’ 
During former President Donald Trump’s 
term, the national average for gasoline had 
gone up to nearly $3 a gallon in May 2018 and 
hovered close to that price until fall 2018, ac-
cording to data maintained by AAA. The 
cost rose yet again to nearly $3 a gallon in 
May 2019 before dropping slightly below $2 
per gallon when state and local governments 
mandated lockdowns in March 2020. 
Gas prices slowly crept from $2.20 per gal-
lon in September 2020 to $2.40 by the time 
Biden took office in January 2021. McGee 
said elections typically drive gasoline prices 
up. 
This upward trend was expected to con-
tinue due to pandemic recovery, reduced 
crude oil supply and the approach of sum-
mer—historically considered a peak travel 
season—but 
arrived 
sooner 
due 
to 
the 
ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, 
the East Coast’s major fuel supplier. 
‘‘We have expected gas prices to hit $3 a 
gallon around Memorial Day, but with the 
(Colonial) 
pipeline 
offline, 
it 
actually 
jumped the national average to $3 and more 
prior to Memorial Day,’’ said McGee. 
KEYSTONE XL, OTHER BIDEN POLICIES DON’T 
AFFECT TODAY’S GASOLINE COSTS 
Many critics point to Biden’s decision on 
the Keystone XL pipeline as fueling the gas 
price spike, but experts say there’s no such 
connection. 
The extension of the Keystone pipeline, 
first proposed in 2008 by TC Energy based in 
Calgary, Canada, was rejected by former 
President Barack Obama in November 2015 
but later approved by Trump in March 2017. 
Biden then suspended the project in January. 
And on June 9, TC Energy announced it was 
terminating the project. 
Even if construction wasn’t halted, the 
Keystone XL pipeline wasn’t in operation 
and therefore wouldn’t have an impact on 
current gas prices, said Finley of Rice Uni-
versity. 
‘‘That was something that would impact 
down the road,’’ he said. 
David Dismukes, economist and executive 
director of Lousiana State University’s Cen-
ter for Energy Studies, agreed, telling USA 
TODAY the pipeline would have had a 
‘‘longer-run impact in providing a diversity 
of supply for refineries in the Gulf Coast.’’ 
Similarly, other energy policies rolled out 
by President Biden, such as postponing oil 
lease sales, have a long-term, but not short- 
term, effect. 
‘‘If you look at some of the actions taken 
by the administration with regard to off-
shore drilling, drilling on federal lands, the 
outlook for fossil fuel energies in general, 
those are impacting the price of crude and 
expectations 
about 
crude 
oil,’’ 
said

Diskmukes. ‘‘(Biden’s policies do) have an 
impact, but that’s not what you’re seeing at 
the pump right now.’’ 
OUR RATING: FALSE 
Based on our research, we rate FALSE the 
claim President Joe Biden is to blame for the 
current higher gas prices. The upward trend 
in gas costs we see now began months before 
Biden took office. Because of reduced de-
mand amid the COVID–19 pandemic, oil com-
panies had to cut back on the amount of 
crude oil produced. Now with restrictions 
being lifted and more travel happening, the 
demand has increased, which, coupled with 
lagging supply, has led to increased gasoline 
prices. Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline 
and other energy policies enacted by Biden 
have a long-term effect on crude oil supply 
but no present impact on gasoline prices. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
President Biden nor his administration 
have direct control of setting gas 
prices. The real issue is Big Oil’s desire 
to pad their profits. 
The CEO of Occidental Petroleum 
said it herself, ‘‘I feel now that we do 
need to return cash to the shareholders 
in the form of dividends or buybacks, 
especially during the better cycles.’’ 
They are thinking in their share-
holders’ best interest, not the interest 
of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Democrats 
and 
their allies on the left can blame Putin 
all they want, and it is partially true 
that Putin’s war in Ukraine is par-
tially to blame. But gas prices have 
risen every month of this administra-
tion. Every month they were up a dol-
lar a gallon before Putin even invaded 
Ukraine. 
The real issue here is supply. 
Why do we have the supply issue? 
It is because Joe Biden on day num-
ber one canceled the Keystone XL pipe-
line. That dried up all capital invest-
ment into hydrocarbon infrastructure. 
Maybe it is a problem because we can-
not get the oil and gas to refineries to 
make sure that we have a supply. 
So what does Joe Biden do instead? 
He blames everybody else. He goes to 
Venezuela and elsewhere, and begs 
them to produce more oil when just 
one administration before under Presi-
dent Trump, we were actually a net ex-
porter of energy. Biden and House 
Democrats have created this mess, and 
the American people know that. 
Are you ready for this fact, Madam 
Speaker? 
The American people will also spend 
$5,000 this year on gas—$5,000 for the 
average American. That is a 78 percent 
increase from a year ago. In other 
words, Americans are spending over 
$2,000 extra a year on gas under Joe 
Biden. 
Blame who you want, Madam Speak-
er, but every time an American looks 
up and sees $100-plus on that gas tank 
that he or she just filled up, they know 
who to blame—Joe Biden and Demo-
crats. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from the great State 
of Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider H.R. 
6858, the American Energy Independ-
ence from Russia Act, to address U.S. 
energy security, the production of oil 
and gas, and the importation and ex-
portation of oil and gas. 
Gas prices have already topped $5 per 
gallon, and economists are predicting 
they will be $6 per gallon by August. 
Every American driver is paying nearly 
double since Biden took office, and the 
crisis is only getting worse. 
b 1330 
This administration should have seen 
this coming. You can say what you 
want. You can blame whoever you 
want. This administration is failing to 
recognize that its policies have had a 
direct result on gas prices. 
You don’t block crucial pipelines. 
You don’t block domestic infrastruc-
ture. You don’t shut down drilling on 
Federal lands, declare war on the oil 
and gas industry, and become reliant 
on Russian oil and not expect prices to 
skyrocket and our global standing to 
weaken. 
This administration is obviously not 
going to do anything but make this cri-
sis worse, so this body must act. 
The American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act will strengthen U.S. 
energy security, counter Russia, create 
American jobs, and protect domestic 
oil and gas dependency and production. 
Republicans have proposed countless 
pragmatic bills, including the Strategy 
to Secure Offshore Energy Act, which I 
recently introduced. This directs the 
Department of the Interior to publish 
the next 5-year plan for offshore oil and 
gas lease sales. 
We must hold this administration ac-
countable as they continue to throw 
their hands up and blame everyone else 
for the energy crisis that they created. 
This bill will help provide the cer-
tainty necessary for continued invest-
ment in offshore production and sup-
port our domestic energy security. 
In my colleague’s home State of Cali-
fornia, gas has reached $9.60 a gallon. 
Surely, we can all agree that that is 
unconscionable and must be addressed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the previous question so that we can 
pass needed legislation to put us back 
on course to unlocking American en-
ergy independence. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, just some quick facts. As Mr. 
DUNCAN stated, House Democrats have 
blocked consideration of legislation to 
unleash America’s energy independ-
ence six times. Six times we have been 
down this road, and House Democrats 
have blocked it. 
Gas prices have gone up 49 cents 
since the last time Republicans asked 
Democrats to bring this bill to the 
floor. Here we are again. 
To talk more about this issue, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ar-
izona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 6858 
to unleash American domestic energy 
production. 
Americans across the country are 
paying sky-high prices at the gas 
pump. Almost every single day for the 
past month, gas prices have hit a new 
record high. 
The national average for a gallon of 
gas is now over $5 per gallon. In Phoe-
nix, my home State, Arizonans are 
paying over $5.60 per gallon. I think 
yesterday it was $5.63 per gallon. 
Filling up at the pump is becoming 
increasingly unaffordable for many 
Americans. As Members of Congress, 
many of us can afford to spend $5 for a 
single gallon of gas. But many Ameri-
cans, like my own kids, who are work-
ing hard, and my senior citizens in my 
district who live on fixed incomes, sim-
ply can’t afford to pay this high price. 
Republicans have a solution. We have 
a plan to increase American energy 
production today and lower prices to-
morrow, if only my colleagues across 
the aisle would agree to take up this 
legislation. 
H.R. 6858 requires the President to 
submit an energy security plan to Con-
gress and requires the Energy Sec-
retary to develop a plan to increase oil 
and gas production on U.S. Federal 
lands. This legislation reinstates the 
Keystone XL pipeline, unleashes Amer-
ican natural gas production and oil 
production, and reverses the oil and 
gas moratorium on Federal lands and 
waters so we can harness our U.S.- 
abundant energy resources. 
Republicans have brought up this 
legislation, as has been said before, for 
consideration several times, but the 
energy crisis just keeps getting worse 
and worse, and gas prices keep getting 
higher. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER), 
my friend and a former police officer. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider H.R. 
6858, the American Energy Independ-
ence from Russia Act, which I am 
proud to cosponsor with my colleagues, 
Representatives 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS 
and WESTERMAN. 
The national average price for a gal-
lon of gasoline today is $5 and climb-
ing. Let that sink in. It is $5 and going 
up. Diesel fuel is skyrocketing at an 
even scarier rate. 
This is a self-imposed crisis on the 
American people. As a candidate, Joe 
Biden pledged again and again to ban 
development 
on 
America’s 
Federal 
lands and waters. He followed through

on that promise, with the House Demo-
crats following suit no matter the pain 
they cause Americans at the pump, no 
matter the costs they impose on busi-
nesses reliant on shipping, trucking, 
and more. 
In contrast, we Republicans are here 
offering solutions. H.R. 6858 takes away 
Joe Biden’s power to ruin our energy 
security and our economy by prohib-
iting harmful drilling bans. The bill 
creates a minimum number of annual 
lease sales, both onshore and offshore. 
It reauthorizes the Keystone XL pipe-
line so we can resume moving energy 
throughout our country. 
Democrats here are calculating that, 
to reduce emissions, it is a necessary 
evil to make gas expensive for Ameri-
cans and punish the middle class. 
Madam Speaker, let me tell you why 
that is dead wrong. Under President 
Trump, when we were net exporters of 
American energy, we averaged emis-
sion reductions of 2.5 percent every 
year. Under President Biden, his first 
year in office, we saw a 6 percent jump 
in domestic emissions. 
These policies Democrats push every 
day, again, are punishing the American 
families, the American workers, and 
the American middle class. It makes it 
harder for businesses to turn a profit. 
It is the leading cause of why our econ-
omy officially became a bear market 
just yesterday. 
Biden’s solution? Trips to Venezuela 
and Saudi Arabia, pleading with com-
munists and human rights violators to 
bail him out of a problem that he 
caused. Let that sink in. He is going to 
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, pleading 
with communists and human rights 
violators to bail him out of a problem 
that he caused. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to my good friend to close. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, it 
does not have to be this way. We can 
bring gas prices down with Republican 
solutions. 
As the ranking member of the En-
ergy 
and 
Mineral 
Resources 
Sub-
committee, I call on my colleagues in 
this body today to do the right thing 
and vote for H.R. 6858 to bring relief to 
the American people. 
Let’s produce our energy right here 
in America. We have the resources, 
technology, and the workforce, and we 
absolutely have the need. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the 
previous question. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I still find it somewhat 
amusing that my friends across the 
aisle continue to blame all this on for-
eign nations and their actions. 
Let me give a quick history lesson on 
how President Joe Biden and Demo-
crats actually caused this crisis. 
Number one, day number one, Joe 
Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipe-
line. 
Number two, he emboldened Putin 
with Nord Stream 2. I would actually 
argue he emboldened Putin to invade 
Ukraine when he recklessly pulled us 
out of Afghanistan, which served zero 
military purpose. But I digress. 
Additionally, Joe Biden suspended oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands. He 
delayed permits for energy and infra-
structure pipelines. He drained the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He re-
voked permits for critical mineral 
projects. He canceled oil leases in Alas-
ka and the Gulf of Mexico. 
What has this done to gas prices? 
Well, in California, gas prices are now 
$9 a gallon. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my neighbor from Pennsyl-
vania for the time here today and for 
this effort. 
I also oppose the previous question 
and want to, instead, bring forward 
H.R. 6858, the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act. It really 
begs the question: With what is going 
on in the world, why are we dependent 
upon Russia for anything, especially 
our energy? 
If the number was somewhere around 
7 percent of the barrels of oil we use, 
we can easily make it up by our own 
production in this country, the amaz-
ing 
hydraulic 
fracturing 
that 
put 
America back on the map for being an 
exporter of natural gas and all the 
other development that we can be 
doing to bring prices back down. 
This administration just seems im-
pervious to the suffering of the Amer-
ican people right now on the cost of en-
ergy and the cost of just about every-
thing else. 
Well, there is another crisis that is 
going to be coming out of this, too. We 
are dependent on Russia and China for 
a product called urea. Now, what is 
that? Well, it is made into a fertilizer, 
basically, that is used extensively in 
American crops. Also, urea has a use as 
a component in what is called diesel 
exhaust fluid. That is a part of making 
our diesel engines run clean on our 
trucks and tractors and whatever else 
uses a diesel engine with DEF in it. 
We are going to run out of DEF pret-
ty soon. The railroads are having a 
hard time delivering it. When that hap-
pens, that means our trucks don’t run 
anymore because they will not run 
without this fluid. 
So, we are dependent on Russia for 
urea, dependent on Russia for energy, 
and want to blame Russia for every-
thing. No. We blame this administra-
tion because we are not doing the steps 
it takes to make ourselves independent 
that we easily have within our grasp to 
do in order to go for what is this great 
reset or the incredible transition the 
President talks about. 
We are being transitioned by this ad-
ministration, and it is very dangerous. 
It is harmful to families, harmful to 
people’s bottom lines on running their 
households, going to work, getting 
their kids to school, all because we 
don’t have an energy policy that 
works. 
Whether the trucks don’t have DEF 
to be able to deliver the goods to the 
store or get it out of the field, what-
ever it is, because we are dependent on 
Russia for energy and all these things, 
we are putting ourselves in a real bad 
spot. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers at 
this time, and I am prepared to close. 
I yield myself the balance of my time 
and remind everybody that, in Joe 
Biden’s America, gas prices are aver-
aging more than $5 a gallon; inflation 
is at a 40-year high; and real wages 
have decreased 10 out of the last 12 
months. 
Yet, with today’s rule, House Demo-
crats are doubling down on far-left, 
radical policies, really failed policies, 
that created Joe Biden’s economic cri-
sis in the first place. 
It is well past time that the Biden 
administration 
and 
congressional 
Democrats admit that they are to 
blame for the economic pain families 
are facing and workers are facing, and 
work with Republicans on solutions to 
immediately help the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my friend from Pennsylvania 
and the Rules Committee for his re-
marks. 
I remind folks that the economy 
under Joe Biden has created over 8 mil-
lion jobs since he took office. The un-
employment rate has dropped from 6.4 
percent to 3.6 percent under President 
Biden. And his first year was the great-
est year of job creation in American 
history. 
The Federal Reserve has found that 
household financial well-being reached 
an all-time high last year. GDP grew in 
the President’s first year by 5.2 per-
cent, the fastest rate since 1984. 
The U.S. was the first advanced econ-
omy that reached prepandemic rates of 
growth, and we are seeing wages in-
crease for workers. 
b 1345 
There is no doubt that inflation and 
the high cost of gasoline are a chal-
lenge. That is the purpose of some of 
our actions today. It is to hold the pri-
vate sector accountable, to be respon-
sible to their consumers and the Amer-
ican people. That is why these bills are 
on the floor, to do something about in-
flation and the high cost of energy. 
At the same time, we are preparing 
for an energy transition. Michigan, 
California, we are aware of the reali-
ties of the current energy economy, 
but we are getting ready for the new 
one.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5505 
June 14, 2022 
In the area I represent, Madam 
Speaker—you have been out to visit 
me—I have five refineries. I have rep-
resented them in local, State, and Fed-
eral Government. Two of them are 
closed because of the pandemic. They 
are about to reopen using biofuels that 
will help everybody, and they are a bet-
ter business model, according to the oil 
industry. So all of these things have 
combined for a challenge. 
I would agree with my colleague. 
This is too important, although we 
have our differences about the ap-
proach, that we should engage in prob-
lem-solving for Americans. 
I thank all of my colleagues for these 
bills and their ideas to deal with infla-
tion and the challenges to American 
workers. Each of these bills in this rule 
are worthwhile and impactful, and I 
look forward to voting for them all 
soon. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and 
the previous question. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as 
follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1170 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6858) to strengthen United States energy se-
curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 13. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6858. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the 
15-minute vote on ordering the pre-
vious question will be followed by 5- 
minute votes on: 
Adoption of the resolution, if or-
dered; and 
Motion to suspend the rules and pass 
S. 4160. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 216, nays

RECOVERING AMERICA’S 
WILDLIFE ACT OF 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 2773) to amend the Pitt-
man-Robertson 
Wildlife 
Restoration 
Act to make supplemental funds avail-
able for management of fish and wild-
life species of greatest conservation 
need as determined by State fish and 
wildlife agencies, and for other pur-
poses, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, in lieu of 
the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources, printed 
in the bill, an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute consisting of the 
text of Rules Committee Print 117–47, 
modified by the amendment printed in 
part C of House Report 117–366, is 
adopted and the bill, as amended, is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 2773 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to extend financial 
and technical assistance to States, territories, 
the District of Columbia, and Indian Tribes, in-
cluding under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife 
Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), for the 
purpose of avoiding the need to list species, or 
recovering species currently listed as a threat-
ened species or an endangered species, under 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.) or under State law. 
TITLE I—WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND 
RESTORATION 
SEC. 101. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND RES-
TORATION SUBACCOUNT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 3 of the Pittman- 
Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 
669b) is amended in subsection (c)— 
(1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as 
paragraphs (9) and (10); and 
(2) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the 
following: 
‘‘(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBACCOUNT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—There is established in the 
fund a subaccount to be known as the ‘Wildlife 
Conservation and Restoration Subaccount’ (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘Subaccount’). 
‘‘(B) AVAILABILITY.—Amounts in the Sub-
account shall be available without further ap-
propriation, for each fiscal year, for apportion-
ment in accordance with this Act. 
‘‘(C) DEPOSITS
INTO
SUBACCOUNT.—The Sec-
retary of the Treasury shall transfer from the 
general fund of the Treasury to the Sub-
account— 
‘‘(i) for fiscal year 2023, $850,000,000; 
‘‘(ii) for fiscal year 2024, $1,100,000,000; 
‘‘(iii) for fiscal year 2025, $1,200,000,000; and 
‘‘(iv) for fiscal year 2026 and each fiscal year 
thereafter, $1,300,000,000. 
‘‘(2) SUPPLEMENT
NOT
SUPPLANT.—Amounts 
transferred to the Subaccount shall supplement, 
but not replace, existing funds available to the 
States from— 
‘‘(A) the funds distributed pursuant to the 
Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act (16 
U.S.C. 777 et seq.); and 
‘‘(B) the fund. 
‘‘(3) INNOVATION GRANTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary shall dis-
tribute 10 percent of funds apportioned from the 
Subaccount through a competitive grant pro-
gram to State fish and wildlife departments, the 
District of Columbia fish and wildlife depart-
ment, fish and wildlife departments of terri-
tories, or to regional associations of fish and 
wildlife departments (or any group composed of 
more than 1 such entity). 
‘‘(B) PURPOSE.—Such grants shall be provided 
for the purpose of catalyzing innovation of tech-
niques, tools, strategies, or collaborative part-
nerships that accelerate, expand, or replicate ef-
fective and measurable recovery efforts for spe-
cies of greatest conservation need and species 
listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
(16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and the habitats of such 
species. 
‘‘(C) 
REVIEW
COMMITTEE.—The 
Secretary 
shall appoint a review committee comprised of— 
‘‘(i) a State Director from each regional asso-
ciation of State fish and wildlife departments; 
‘‘(ii) the head of a department responsible for 
fish and wildlife management in a territory; 
‘‘(iii) one delegate from the United States Fish 
and Wildlife Service, for the purpose of pro-
viding technical assistance; and 
‘‘(iv) beginning in fiscal year 2023, four indi-
viduals representing four different nonprofit or-
ganizations each of which is actively partici-
pating in carrying out wildlife conservation res-
toration activities using funds apportioned from 
the Subaccount. 
‘‘(D) SUPPORT FROM UNITED STATES FISH AND 
WILDLIFE SERVICE.—Using not more than 3 per-
cent of the amounts apportioned under subpara-
graph (A) to carry out a competitive grant pro-
gram, the United States Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice shall provide any personnel or administra-
tive support services necessary for such com-
mittee to carry out its responsibilities under this 
Act. 
‘‘(E) 
EVALUATION.—Such 
committee 
shall 
evaluate each proposal submitted under this 
paragraph and recommend projects for funding, 
giving preference to solutions that accelerate the 
recovery of species identified as priorities 
through regional scientific assessments of spe-
cies of greatest conservation need.

tion 4(e), by carrying out, revising, or enhanc-
ing existing wildlife and habitat conservation 
and restoration programs and developing and 
implementing new wildlife conservation and res-
toration programs to recover and manage species 
of greatest conservation need and the key habi-
tats and plant community types essential to the 
conservation of those species, as determined by 
the appropriate State fish and wildlife depart-
ment; 
‘‘(B) shall be used to develop, revise, and en-
hance the Wildlife Conservation Strategy of a 
State, territory, or the District of Columbia, as 
may be required by this Act; 
‘‘(C) shall be used to assist in the recovery of 
species found in the State, territory, or the Dis-
trict of Columbia that are listed as endangered

‘‘(E) may be used to manage a species of 
greatest conservation need whose range is 
shared with another State, territory, Indian 
Tribe, or foreign government and for the con-
servation of the habitat of such species; 
‘‘(F) may be used to manage, control, and pre-
vent invasive species, disease, and other risks to

GERED SPECIES RECOVERY.—Not less than an av-
erage of 15 percent over a 5-year period of 
amounts apportioned to a State, territory, or the 
District of Columbia from the Subaccount shall

requirement of a State, territory, or the District 
of Columbia on an annual basis if the Secretary 
determines that the State, territory, or the Dis-
trict of Columbia is meeting the conservation 
and recovery needs of all species described in 
paragraph (4)(C). 
‘‘(6) PUBLIC ACCESS TO PRIVATE LANDS NOT RE-
QUIRED.—Funds apportioned from the Sub-
account shall not be conditioned upon the pro-
vision of public access to private lands, waters, 
or holdings. 
‘‘(7) REQUIREMENTS FOR MATCHING FUNDS.— 
‘‘(A) For the purposes of the non-Federal 
fund matching requirement for a wildlife con-
servation or restoration program or project 
funded by the Subaccount, a State, territory, or 
the District of Columbia may use as matching 
non-Federal funds— 
‘‘(i) funds from Federal agencies other than 
the Department of the Interior and the Depart-
ment of Agriculture; 
‘‘(ii) donated private lands and waters, in-
cluding privately owned easements; 
‘‘(iii) in circumstances described in subpara-
graph (B), revenue generated through the sale 
of State hunting and fishing licenses; and 
‘‘(iv) other sources consistent with part 80 of 
title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, in effect 
on the date of enactment of the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act of 2022. 
‘‘(B) Revenue described in subparagraph 
(A)(iii) may only be used to fulfill the require-
ments of such non-Federal fund matching re-
quirement if— 
‘‘(i) no Federal funds apportioned to the State 
fish and wildlife department of such State from 
the Wildlife Restoration Program or the Sport 
Fish Restoration Program have been reverted 
because of a failure to fulfill such non-Federal 
fund matching requirement by such State dur-
ing the previous 2 years; and 
‘‘(ii) the project or program being funded ben-
efits the habitat of a hunted or fished species 
and a species of greatest conservation need. 
‘‘(8) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection, the fol-
lowing definitions apply:

GREATEST
CONSERVATION 
NEED.—The term ‘species of greatest conserva-
tion need’ may be fauna or flora, and may in-
clude terrestrial, aquatic, marine, and inverte-

Michigan 
(Mrs. DINGELL) and the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN), each will

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2773. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 2773, the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act. This legisla-
tion has been years in the making, and 
this moment is the culmination of the 
collected works of a bipartisan group of 
Members, a strong, diverse coalition of 
advocates, and grassroots support from 
across the country. 
This work began in 2015 when the As-
sociation of Fish and Wildlife Agen-
cies—which represents State fish and 
wildlife agencies across the country— 
established a blue ribbon panel on sus-
taining America’s diverse fish and 
wildlife resources. 
After working closely with hunting 
and fishing organizations, as well as 
partners in the sportsmen’s commu-
nity, businesses, and other advocates, 
it was decided that we needed a 21st 
century model of funding conservation 
to address the current shortfalls in 
wildlife conservation. 
Right now, the United States is fac-
ing an unprecedented biodiversity cri-
sis. One-third of all bird species are in 
need of urgent conservation action. In 
fact, the number of birds in the United 
States and Canada have fallen by 29 
percent since 1970; a decline of almost 3 
billion fewer birds. 
We have seen similar declines across 
the board. For example, 40 percent of 
freshwater fish species are also at risk. 
One-third of all U.S. wildlife species 
are currently imperiled or vulnerable. 
These developments threaten our 
common environmental heritage, re-
duce opportunities for outdoor recre-
ation, and will require costly and ag-
gressive interventions if not addressed 
soon. 
This legislation is particularly crit-
ical for the sportsmen’s community. As 
one of the co-chairs of the Congres-
sional Sportsmen’s Caucus, I have al-
ways said that sportsmen and women 
are some of our best conservation advo-
cates, as they understand the on-the- 
ground reality of the decline in wildlife 
and the importance of cost-effective 
conservation. 
Their input has been critical to the 
historic and innovative legislation be-
fore us today. Without a change in the 
way we finance fish and wildlife con-
servation, the list of Federally threat-
ened and endangered species will bal-
loon from nearly 1,600 species today to 
thousands more in the future. 
b 1500 
The cost of inaction is immense. The 
longer we wait to address this issue, 
the more resources we will ultimately 
need to safeguard our Nation’s wildlife 
and environment. And we cannot keep 
waiting. We must take the bold, urgent 
action that addresses the scale of the 
threat. We need strong, proactive con-
servation measures to address these

unmet needs, and that is why the Re-
covering America’s Wildlife Act is nec-
essary. 
The 
legislation 
provides 
approxi-
mately $1.4 billion in dedicated, annual 
funding to the States, territories, and 
Native American Tribes for proactive 
conservation efforts for the approxi-
mately 12,000 species of wildlife and 
plants identified under State wildlife 
action plans. 
This bold investment in our Nation’s 
wildlife will pay significant dividends. 
It will allow States to take proactive 
action that will prevent at-risk species 
from becoming endangered. This is 
critical not only to preserving our 
common environmental heritage, but 
for supporting hunters, anglers, and 
the almost $900 billion outdoor recre-
ation economy. 
As I have said previously, as one of 
the co-chairs of the Congressional 
Sportsmen’s Caucus, I understand the 
importance of these measures to sup-
port fishermen and hunters across the 
country. 
I thank my three fellow co-chairs of 
the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus 
who have sponsored the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act as well. It 
shows the strong, bipartisan support 
for this bill. 
The broad group of stakeholders sup-
porting 
the 
Recovering 
America’s 
Wildlife Act underscores the need for 
action and the support for this ap-
proach. Hundreds of leading sports-
men’s groups, hunting and fishing ad-
vocates across the country, conserva-
tion organizations, environmental or-
ganizations, and businesses, all support 
the legislation for good reason: it uti-
lizes proven funding mechanisms, bold-
ly 
addresses 
pressing 
conservation 
needs, and prevents the need for more 
costly interventions in the future. 
The Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act is the product of years and years of 
work 
and 
consultation 
with 
these 
stakeholders and has broad bipartisan 
support. This legislation has received 
bipartisan support in both the House 
and Senate, and the thoughtful input 
of my colleagues has resulted in strong 
consensus legislation that will benefit 
every single congressional district in 
the country. 
We have a conservation, economic, 
and moral rationale to act in order to 
protect and recover America’s wildlife 
for future generations. This is an op-
portunity to take historic action to ad-
dress a pressing conservation need, and 
I ask my colleagues that they support 
the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in reluctant 
opposition to H.R. 2773, as drafted. The 
goal of this bill is commendable. Re-
publicans and Democrats alike want to 
see America’s wildlife thrive. Unfortu-
nately, the legislation as written con-
tains partisan provisions that I simply 
cannot support. 
State and Tribal fish and wildlife 
agencies have long been recognized as 
the primary and most well-equipped 
managers of local species and habitat 
in the United States. After all, those 
on the ground are more attuned to 
what is happening in their backyards 
than the Federal Government. That is 
why State and Tribal wildlife agencies, 
as 
well 
as 
prominent 
sportsmen’s 
groups support this bill. 
While the bill would provide financial 
resources to States and Tribes to help 
meet 
wildlife 
recovery 
goals, 
the 
spending is mandatory and lacks any 
offset. This spending is not pocket 
change. The Congressional Budget Of-
fice estimated the Rules Committee 
Print would lead to more than $12 bil-
lion—that 
is 
$12 
billion—in 
direct 
spending in the first decade of the pro-
gram alone. And I say the first decade, 
because that is only what is in the so- 
called scoring window. In reality, this 
program and its mandatory spending 
would last forever since there is no 
sunset in titles I and II of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not the modern- 
day funding models suggested by the 
blue ribbon commission. This is an im-
portant issue, and we should make the 
responsible, tough decisions on how to 
fund it. 
This funding model has no offset 
ever, and it has an average expenditure 
of $1.4 billion per year. It is the most 
irresponsible, lazy way to fund the pro-
gram, especially with the record gov-
ernment spending that is contributing 
to record inflation. At a time of ramp-
ant inflation, it would be wildly irre-
sponsible to drive inflation even higher 
and saddle future generations with the 
consequences. The debt created by this 
bill will only add to our Nation’s cur-
rent $30 trillion debt. 
This bill also lacks a sunset provi-
sion. Without a sunset, there is no 
mechanism to ensure oversight or 
proper review of the program to fix 
flaws that may arise. Mandating a per-
manent new program is poor govern-
ance, and it ignores precedent. Con-
gress routinely passes legislation like 
the Farm Bill or the Water Resources 
Development Act which have proper 
sunsets. Those sunsets require us to 
come back and do our jobs by assessing 
what is working, what is not working, 
and making tweaks and changes to the 
law. 
The bill does not allow Congress the 
opportunity to perform the needed 
oversight. Instead, it requires spending 
$1.4 billion per year in perpetuity. I, 
and my fellow Republican committee 
members, tried to resolve these fiscal 
issues with amendments at the com-
mittee markup. We were told by the 
Democrat majority that, although they 
opposed these amendments at the time, 
they would work with us on finding a 
funding offset before this bill would be 
considered on the floor. 
We stayed at the negotiating table, 
as did the bill’s sponsor, Mrs. DINGELL, 
whom I have a lot of respect for and 
commend her for her efforts on this 
bill. But larger forces decided to ram 
this bill forward without fixing any-
thing. In fact, the majority made the 
bill worse than it was when it left our 
committee. 
They decided to airdrop provisions 
into a new title III that would siphon 
money away from States and Tribes 
and give it to the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service. That is in direct contrast 
to the spirit of this bill to give money 
to the State and Tribal agencies so 
that they could do the management. 
We never even had the chance to de-
bate this terrible title in the com-
mittee. The whole point of this bill was 
to empower States and Tribes who are 
the ones, again, who are closest to our 
lands and waters, not to increase the 
Washington, D.C., Federal bureauc-
racy, which is now what this bill will 
do. 
A number of Republican amendments 
proposed to the Rules Committee tried 
to fix these problems and several other 
issues but they were similarly ignored, 
depriving us of ways to improve the 
bill and debate these issues today. As a 
result of all of this, we have a regret-
tably flawed bill. The situation we are 
now in was avoidable. The bill before 
us represents a lost opportunity to 
forge 
significant 
bipartisan 
com-
promise. It didn’t have to be this way, 
and I hope that this is not a partisan 
sign of the future of conservation. 
I will remain at the table and hope 
that my Democratic colleagues come 
back and work together with us on a 
lasting solution. Until then, I am op-
posed to H.R. 2773, and I reluctantly en-
courage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my col-
league’s 
perspective 
on 
permanent 
funding, and I have a great deal of re-
spect for him. We have and will always 
continue to work together on conserva-
tion issues. But the fact is we know 
that stable and predictable funding is 
critical to effective conservation ef-
forts, and that is what the blue ribbon 
panel on sustaining America’s diverse 
fish and wildlife resources—which in-
cluded 26 members from the hunting 
and fishing business and outdoor recre-
ation communities—found in their 2016 
report whose recommendations formed 
the basis of this legislation. We have 
seen that this funding structure has 
been fundamental to the success of 
Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-John-
son conservation programs upon which 
this is built. 
I appreciate my colleague’s views on 
oversight. This legislation contains ro-
bust guardrails to ensure that there is 
appropriate use of public funds, includ-
ing reporting requirements and other 
oversight provisions. 
So the Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act does meet the moment because of 
its funding structure and because of 
the strong oversight language which is

June 14, 2022 
supported by the coalitions of hundreds 
of organizations. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
HUFFMAN). 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative DINGELL for the time 
and for her great work on this land-
mark bipartisan legislation, the Recov-
ering 
America’s 
Wildlife 
Act, 
or 
RAWA, as we call it. 
This is a bright spot amidst so many 
problems facing our Nation. As our 
constituents are well aware, the cli-
mate crisis and other human impacts 
have dramatically harmed our Nation’s 
wildlife, and, in fact, State agencies 
have identified 12,000 wildlife species 
that are in need of conservation assist-
ance. In the United States alone, there 
are currently 1,300 species that are ei-
ther threatened or endangered. If we 
fail to act, these profound and irrevers-
ible losses will continue to have dev-
astating ecosystem impacts. 
States, territories, and Tribes are 
doing great work to address threats to 
wildlife, but their conservation efforts 
have been chronically underfunded for 
decades. This stream of dedicated fund-
ing from RAWA is a lifeline for local 
wildlife agencies. 
This bill also provides local govern-
ments the resources to address key ele-
ments impacting biodiversity loss such 
as wildfire and drought which are wors-
ening as the climate crisis accelerates. 
RAWA lays the groundwork for wild-
fire threat mitigation on a number of 
fronts, including managing vegetation 
and creating wildlife-friendly fire man-
agement plans on the front end, per-
forming emergency rescues during the 
fires, and restoring critical habitat 
after fires. 
RAWA funding will also allow local 
communities to restore habitats that 
have been harmed by drought and pro-
tect vulnerable ecosystems from fur-
ther damage because we know these 
drought conditions are going to con-
tinue. 
We cannot lose sight of the cultural 
implications of this legislation. The 
funding in this bill for Tribal nations 
to recover fish and wildlife is critical 
to protecting the species that have 
been integral to their cultures since 
time immemorial. Biodiversity is de-
clining at a rate not seen since the last 
mass extinction. Tackling this crisis 
simply cannot wait. 
As chairman of the Water, Oceans, 
and Wildlife Subcommittee of the 
House Natural Resources Committee, I 
am incredibly glad to see this bill on 
the floor today with strong bipartisan 
support—42 Republican cosponsors, and 
152 Democrats. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
will point out that even though there 
is a reporting requirement in the legis-
lation, once you approve mandatory, 
permanent spending, then Congress 
loses our leverage. Creating a perma-
nent program doesn’t bode well for 
oversight from Congress. Programs 
that were mentioned like Pittman- 
Robinson, think about the land and 
water conservation fund, all of those 
had dedicated funding streams. This 
funding is coming straight out of the 
Treasury. It is coming out of our kids’ 
and our grandkids’ piggy banks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD an article from Claremont 
Review of Books, spring, 2022, titled 
‘‘In the Red,’’ by Jeffrey H. Anderson. 
IN THE RED 
Our glidepath to insolvency. 
When Ross Perot won an impressive 19 per-
cent of the popular vote as an independent 
candidate for president in 1992, his main 
issue was the national debt. In one of his un-
usual, half-hour-long campaign ads, Perot 
declared, ‘‘Just this year, we ran up $341 bil-
lion in new debt . . . . That’s our legislators 
and our president trying to buy our vote, this 
year, with what used to be our money.’’ 
Three decades later, our national debt— 
which reached $4 trillion the year that Perot 
ran—has hit $30 trillion. If our debt were to 
keep rising at that rate over the next 60 
years, it would increase more than 50-fold 
and surpass $1.5 quadrillion (a quadrillion, 
which sounds like a made-up number, is a 
thousand trillions). 
The portion of the national debt that real-
ly matters is the almost 80 percent that’s 
held by entities—whether foreign or state-
side—other than the federal government. 
Such ‘‘debt held by the public,’’ which is 
fueled by deficit spending, has to be paid 
back to outside entities, whereas debt not 
held 
by 
the 
public 
merely 
involves 
intragovernmental transfers. Foreign hold-
ings compose about a third of all debt held 
by the public. Japan and China hold by far 
the most (over $1 trillion each), some of 
which belongs to private investors and some 
to government entities. Put another way, 
China—an increasingly hostile world super-
power—has more than $1 trillion of leverage 
over us. 
It’s getting worse, fast. Our recent deficit 
spending has been truly historic. In 2020, 
based on official federal tallies (the basis for 
all figures in this essay), the federal govern-
ment brought in $3.4 trillion in tax revenues 
and dished our $6.6 trillion in spending—so, 
for every $10 that came in, $19 went out. This 
lavish 
expenditure 
smashed 
the 
deficit 
record like New York’s Bob Beamon smashed 
the long-jump record in the 1968 Olympics. 
Beamon soared past the previous record—27 
feet, 43⁄4 inches—to make an astounding 29- 
foot, 21⁄2-inch jump. In similar fashion, with 
the deficit record sitting at $1.4 trillion, the 
federal government in 2020 spent a spectac-
ular $3.1 trillion that it didn’t have. In 2020 
alone, the government racked up more def-
icit spending than it had during the first 36 
fiscal years of the postwar era (1947 through 
1982), and that’s after adjusting for inflation. 
Even before our blowout spending during 
COVID, our deficits had already reached 
breathtaking levels. In constant 2012 dollars 
(to adjust for inflation), the average annual 
deficit during the four years from 2016 
through 2019—a stretch of relative peace and 
prosperity—was $700 billion. In comparison, 
during the four years from 1942 through 
1945—during which we funded and fought a 
two-front war against Nazi Germany and Im-
perial Japan—the average annual deficit was 
$505 billion in constant 2012 dollars. After the 
war (using the Office of Management and 
Budget’s composite deflator), we owed $3 
trillion of debt held by the public in constant 
2012 dollars (four times what we owed when 
the war began). Subsequent statesmen suc-
ceeded in cutting that tally in half by 1974 
(to $1.5 trillion), but it rose back to end-of- 
World-War-II levels by 1986 (to $3 trillion), 
doubled end-of-World-War-II levels by 2008 
($6 trillion), tripled them by 2010 ($9 trillion), 
quadrupled them by 2014 ($12 trillion), quin-
tupled them by 2019 ($15 trillion), and 
sextupled them by 2020 ($18 trillion). 
In other words, we added as much debt held 
by the public in 2020 alone as we did from the 
end of World War II to the end of 2008, and we 
racked up more debt in the 12 months of 2020 
than we did during the four years of the Sec-
ond World War. That’s after adjusting for in-
flation. 
NO BIG DEAL 
And yet, incredibly, many politicians and 
commentators claim that our staggering in-
debtedness is nothing much to worry about. 
Unwilling to face the challenge of reining in 
the budget, we seem to have thrown up our 
hands in recent years and chosen to treat our 
ballooning deficits as funny money. 
Debt apologists like to measure taxes, 
spending, and debt in relation to the gross 
domestic product (GDP), rather than in rela-
tion to inflation or population growth. That 
way, if Americans’ tax bills double, but the 
economy doubles in size over that same span, 
it can be said that Americans aren’t paying 
any more in taxes (as a percentage of GDP). 
The same thing is true with the debt, which 
only rises by this measure if it increases 
faster than economic output. 
This way of talking partially masks the 
magnitude of our debt problem by assuming 
that our government should grow every bit 
as fast as our economy. Even so, by the per-
cent-of-GDP measure, debt held by the pub-
lic is now at approximately end-of-World 
War II levels. But whereas it fell dramati-
cally after World War II, there is no reason 
to think it will do so now. It more than tri-
pled from 2001 (32 percent of GDP) to 2020 (100 
percent of GDP), putting us on course to sur-
pass 300 percent of GDP if it grows at the 
same rate from 2020 to 2039. 
For all of the myriad cultural, techno-
logical, and moral problems we face, few 
things would guarantee the undoing of the 
founders’ 
experiment 
in 
self-government 
more surely than continuing to pile on the 
burden, to ourselves and our posterity, of 
runaway debt. Thomas Jefferson described 
fiscal profligacy as a precursor to inevitable 
misery and suffering, the first in a stampede 
of apocalyptic horsemen. ‘‘[T]he fore horse of 
this frightful team is public debt,’’ he wrote. 
‘‘Taxation follows that, and in its train 
wretchedness and oppression.’’ This wretch-
edness will only be more keenly felt as inter-
est rates rise. Too much debt puts power in 
the hands of our enemies and renders the av-
erage American poorer every year. 
MANDATORY BANKRUPTCY 
The first step in avoiding a truly calami-
tous, debt-ridden future is to understand bow 
we got ourselves into this predicament to 
begin with. It is not national defense or even 
the New Deal but rather the Great Society 
that is bankrupting us. 
A fundamental preliminary question is 
whether our government taxes too little or 
spends too much. The answer is easy to de-
termine. In 2021, the federal government col-
lected more than three-and-a-half times as 
much money, in real dollars per capita—that 
is, above and beyond inflation and popu-
lation growth—as it did at the start of the 
postwar period. But it spent nearly seven 
times as much. From 1947 (the first postwar 
fiscal year, as FY 1946 began in July of 1945) 
through 2021, the population of the United 
States rose 2.3-fold, while prices rose nearly 
13-fold. Combining these two factors, the fed-
eral government could have collected and

spent 29 times as much in nominal dollars in 
2021 as it did in 1947 without collecting or 
spending any more in real (inflation-ad-
justed) dollars per capita. Instead, the fed-
eral government taxed more than 100 times 
as much in 2021 as in 1947 and spent almost 
200 times as much. By any reasonable stand-
ard, our government isn’t afflicted by a 
shortage of tax revenues but by an almost 
endless appetite for spending. 
What are we spending all of that money 
on? Contra the Left’s repeated claims, it isn’t 
defense—and our debt problem wasn’t cre-
ated by Ronald Reagan. We actually spend 
less per capita on defense now, after adjust-
ing for inflation, than we did during the Ken-
nedy Administration. Real per-capita de-
fense spending fell from $2,283 in 1962 to 
$1,953 in 2020, a drop of 14 percent. Even at 
the height of the Reagan defense buildup, we 
exceeded the 1962 level by only 2 percent. 
Meanwhile, real per-capita spending on ev-
erything but defense increased more than 
eight-fold (from $1,930 in 1962 to $15,646 in 
2020). If overall federal spending had followed 
the same trajectory as defense spending, we 
would have had a surplus in 2020 of $2.1 tril-
lion instead of a deficit of $3.1 trillion. 
The problem isn’t defense: it’s health care. 
More specifically, it was Lyndon Johnson 
and his (mostly) Democratic congressional 
allies who put us on a glidepath toward in-
solvency with the passage of their Great So-
ciety programs. The New Deal put strain on 
the federal budget, to be sure, but not 
enough to break it. By 1964, over three dec-
ades after Franklin Roosevelt had taken of-
fice, federal debt held by the public had fall-
en more than 40 percent from the end of 
World War II, in real (inflation-adjusted) dol-
lars. The real deficit was 1/68th as large as it 
would be in 2020. As the first Ford Mustangs 
rolled off the assembly line, the country’s 
debt was manageable and dropping, its defi-
cits were minimal, and seven of the postwar 
years had actually produced surpluses. The 
next year, Johnson signed legislation cre-
ating Medicare and Medicaid. 
Broadly speaking, there are two ways to 
fund federal programs. Congress either de-
cides how much funding a program will get 
(‘‘discretionary’’ spending), or just puts a 
program on autopilot and finds out later how 
much it turned out to cost (‘‘mandatory’’ 
spending). With discretionary spending, Con-
gress decides each year how much money to 
appropriate (for something like national de-
fense), taking into account such quaint no-
tions as what we need and what we can af-
ford. With ‘‘mandatory’’ spending, Congress 
creates a program and pledges to fund it at 
the same time, even though no one knows 
what its price tag will be. 
Within ‘‘mandatory’’ spending, there are 
programs that have a dedicated and gen-
erally sufficient revenue stream (such as So-
cial Security), and there are those that do 
not have a dedicated revenue stream that 
comes anywhere near covering their costs— 
such 
as 
Medicare 
and 
Medicaid 
(and 
Obamacare, part of which expanded Med-
icaid). Payroll taxes cover only about a third 
of Medicare’s costs and none of Medicaid’s. 
In other words, no one who launched these 
programs had any idea how to pay for them. 
This has had extraordinary consequences. 
The first year that Medicare spending visibly 
hit the books was 1967. From that point 
through 2020, Medicare and Medicaid cost a 
combined $17.8 trillion, while our combined 
federal deficits over that same span were 
$17.9 trillion. In essence, our deficit problem 
is a Medicare and Medicaid problem. 
THE FATHER OF OUR DEBT 
By 1975, a decade after they were created, 
Medicare and Medicaid were entrenched. 
From that point through 2019—the most re-
cent ‘‘normal’’ (pre-COVID) spending year— 
real per-capita Medicare and Medicaid spend-
ing rose nine-fold (more than triple the rise 
in Social Security costs over that period). In 
1975, we spent more than five times as much 
on defense as on Medicare and Medicaid com-
bined. By 2019, we spent 56 percent more on 
Medicare and Medicaid than on defense. 
In 2019, the federal government collected 
about $10,500 in revenues per capita and 
spent about $13,500. Here’s how Americans’ 
contributions to the federal treasury were 
allocated. The first $1,000 essentially just 
went into the trash—it was used to pay in-
terest on the debt, not to buy anything. 
About $2,000 was spent on defense and an-
other $2,000 on non-defense discretionary 
spending. Roughly $3,000 was spent on Social 
Security, $3,000 on Medicare and Medicaid 
(with about a 60 percent–40 percent split be-
tween them), and $2,500 on other ‘‘manda-
tory’’ 
spending, 
to 
include 
much 
of 
Obamacare, unemployment, welfare, etc. So, 
in all, about $4,000 (or roughly 30 percent) 
was discretionary spending, actually voted 
upon by Congress, and about $9,500 (roughly 
70 percent) was either ‘‘mandatory’’ spending 
or payments on the national debt. 
If we had a Mount Rushmore of deficit 
spending, then, Lyndon Johnson would merit 
George Washington’s place of honor as the 
father of our debt. Beside him would be the 
three most recent presidents. For we have 
run up more debt under Barack Obama, Don-
ald Trump, and Joe Biden—even after adjust-
ing for inflation—than we did under the pre-
vious 42 presidents combined. After a brief 
period of fiscal responsibility under Bill 
Clinton, the average annual deficit soared to 
$455 billion under George W. Bush ($41 billion 
more than under his father), $857 billion 
under Obama, and $1.462 trillion under 
Trump (who was averaging $805 billion even 
before COVID hit). 
Again—amazingly—these figures are ad-
justed for inflation. They are based on each 
president’s having been responsible for the 
deficit the year after he took office—for ex-
ample, Obama, who took office when fiscal 
year 2009 was already underway, was respon-
sible for fiscal years 2010 through 2017. But 
note the following exceptions: the $179 bil-
lion in Obama-signed ‘‘stimulus’’ funds spent 
in 2009, and the $1.115 trillion in Biden-signed 
COVID ‘‘stimulus’’ funds spent in 2021 are 
treated as part of Obama’s and Biden’s def-
icit tallies, respectively; and the $147 billion 
in TARP loans repaid in 2010 ($110 billion) 
and 2011 ($37 billion) are counted as reduc-
tions in George W. Bush’s deficit tallies, as 
they paid back money that was counted as 
deficit spending when it was loaned out on 
Bush’s watch. 
Clinton is the obvious outlier, having man-
aged an average annual surplus of $3 billion 
during his eight years in office, six of them 
with a Republican Congress. After Perot 
sounded the alarm and Republicans won the 
House for the first time in four decades, 
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republican 
colleagues—working 
with 
Clinton—made 
good on the Contract with America’s pledge 
to balance the budget. They cut defense 
spending, passed welfare reform, benefitted 
from a strong economy that increased reve-
nues, and were able to lower federal interest 
payments as the debt fell. Most surprisingly, 
however, they managed to cut Medicare 
spending, via reforms passed through the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). After 
Medicare’s costs had quadrupled from 1982 to 
1997, they actually dropped from 1998 to 
1999—not just in comparison to inflation, but 
in terms of the actual number of dollars that 
went out the door. 
It was around this time that the ‘‘experts’’ 
decided the work was done and the free- 
spending days could return once again. In 
2002, after the George W. Bush tax cues had 
been enacted, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice (CBO) projected that the federal govern-
ment would run a surplus in nine out of the 
ten years from 2003 through 2012 and a dec-
ade-long surplus of $2.3 trillion. It turned out 
that the federal government ran a deficit in 
all ten of those years and a decade-long def-
icit of $7.l trillion. The CBO also projected 
that debt held by the public at the end of 
2012 would be $1.3 trillion. It turned out to be 
$11.3 trillion, so the CBO was off by $10 tril-
lion and a factor of nearly nine. 
Despite this subsequent debt explosion, the 
Clinton-Gingrich era was a successful one in 
terms of fiscal responsibility. Indeed, over 
the past 40 years, deficits have been lowest 
when a Democrat has been in the White 
House and Republicans have controlled both 
houses of Congress. The second-best scenario 
has been a Republican president with either 
party controlling both houses of Congress. 
Next-best has been a Democratic president 
paired with a mixed Congress (with each 
party controlling one house), followed by a 
Republican president paired with a mixed 
Congress. The worst scenario has been Demo-
cratic control of the whole government. Over 
the past four decades, Democratic control 
(average deficit of $1.1 trillion in constant 
2012 dollars) has been more than twice as 
costly as Republican control ($490 billion). 
No matter who is in power, however, about 
70 percent of our spending—consuming about 
90 percent of our tax revenues—is on auto-
pilot. To balance the budget by focusing 
solely on cutting those portions of the budg-
et that Congress actively controls through 
the appropriations process, we would have to 
cut discretionary spending—which includes 
defense—by about 75 percent. Any realistic 
effort to balance the budget, therefore, must 
focus on ‘‘mandatory’’ spending. 
FIXING OUR MESS 
Medicare absolutely must be reformed. Its 
autopilot has malfunctioned and is flying 
not only the plane but also the country into 
the ground. We came tantalizingly close to 
fixing things back in 1999, when the National 
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of 
Medicare grew out of the BBA and drafted an 
appealing blueprint for reform. The Commis-
sion, chaired by Democratic Senator John 
Breaux and Republican Congressman Bill 
Thomas, floated a variety of proposals, most 
notably ‘‘premium support,’’ which would 
utilize private competition to keep public 
costs down. But events intervened: Politico 
healthcare editor Adriel Bettelheim writes 
that ‘‘with the Monica Lewinsky scandal fes-
tering and the threat . . . of impeachment 
growing, [Clinton] took a very public turn to 
appease his left flank’’ and turned against 
the commission just as it was wrapping up 
its 11 months of work. 
Nevertheless, the commission was a seri-
ous effort at exploring promising ideas, 
many of which Congressman Paul Ryan 
picked up during his Obamacare-fighting era. 
Ryan’s advocacy of premium support did not 
keep him from being tapped as Mitt Rom-
ney’s 2012 running mate, nor did it hurt the 
Romney-Ryan ticket (Romney did that all 
on his own). This suggests that Medicare re-
form can be politically viable when advanced 
with determination and skill. 
Medicaid also cannot go on in its present 
form. Its funding system, whereby every $1 
of state funding is matched by between $1 
and $9 of federal funding, invites waste and 
inefficiency. The more a state spends on 
Medicaid, the more federal money it gets. If 
it manages to reform its Medicaid program, 
it gets at most half of the savings—usually 
far less. Also, states often hire consultants 
who concoct elaborate shell games to exag-
gerate states’ Medicaid funding, thereby

bringing in even more federal money, much 
of which funds non-Medicaid ventures. If 
Medicaid were reformed so that each stare 
simply received a given amount of federal 
funding, independent of the state’s level of 
funding, that would presumably remove 
most of these perverse incentives and reduce 
Medicaid’s costs. 
Social Security has always been self-fund-
ed, but it too is projected to dip into the red 
about a dozen years from now. It poses no-
where near the threat to our fiscal solvency 
that Medicare and Medicaid do, bur its costs 
have still risen faster than overall federal 
spending, and it does need to be sensibly re-
vised. The percentage of the U.S. population 
that is over age 75 is roughly the same as the 
percentage that was over age 65 when Social 
Security was created, yet the eligibility age 
for receiving full retirement benefits has 
been raised just two years (from 65 to 67) 
over the past eight decades. Gradually (but 
not too gradually) raising that age to reflect 
current biological and fiscal realities is an 
obvious and necessary fix. 
In addition to changing individual pro-
grams, there are measures we can take to 
promote fiscal responsibility more generally. 
Simply demanding a balanced budget, either 
as a matter of policy or through a constitu-
tional amendment, will not do: the state 
could still spend as much as it accrued, 
which might encourage ever-greater levels of 
taxation to fund an ever-larger government, 
as in many European countries. Instead, we 
ought to focus on measures that can keep 
spending itself low. 
For 
instance, 
the 
American 
citizenry 
would be more apt to view the debt as a 
shared concern if nearly everyone paid at 
least some income tax, as Florida Senator 
Rick Scott has proposed. At the least, no 
one’s income tax bill should go negative, as 
it does when tax credits are made ‘‘refund-
able’’—available not as a tax cut but as a 
payment to those who don’t pay income tax. 
A few years ago, I released ‘‘The Main Street 
Tax Plan’’ (Hudson Institute, 2016), which 
the Tax Foundation said would reduce defi-
cits. It declared, ‘‘Nearly everyone should be 
paying something in income tax, however 
small, and Americans shouldn’t regard April 
15 as a payday.’’ 
Some, such as Senator Mitch McConnell, 
oppose Scott’s proposal because—in McCon-
nell’s words—it ‘‘raises taxes’’ (for people 
who don’t pay income taxes). Those who 
share this concern should consider pairing 
refund reform with an end to the Medicare 
payroll tax. Unlike the Social Security pay-
roll tax, which is viral and funds Social Se-
curity as a (more or less) pay-in-for-yourself 
program, the Medicare payroll tax funds 
only about a third of Medicare and helps per-
petuate the false notion that Medicare too is 
mostly pay-in-for-yourself. Eliminating the 
Medicare payroll tax would soften the per-
ception of Medicare as an entitlement, sim-
plify the tax code, and ease the tax burden of 
the working poor. Combining this with 
Scott’s plan would encourage more people to 
care about the size and scope of the federal 
government. 
In 2010, back when the Tea Party was as-
cendant and the national debt was $13 tril-
lion rather than $30 trillion, I proposed (in 
National Affairs) a Limited Government 
Amendment to the Constitution. Such an 
amendment would limit annual increases in 
federal spending to inflation plus two per-
centage points, except during a formally de-
clared war, or if two-thirds of Congress and 
three-quarters of state legislatures author-
ized additional spending for other reasons. 
An amendment in this spirit could greatly 
facilitate fiscal restraint. 
It has become fashionable to think of con-
stitutional amendments as relics from the 
past. But then, so are fiscal responsibility 
and—increasingly—representative 
govern-
ment. The founders made the Constitution 
amendable for a reason, and we should take 
our cues from them. In the late 1990s, we 
showed—briefly—that it’s possible to take 
action to reverse our course and help save 
our country from the tragic fate that Jeffer-
son described. But the first step is to recog-
nize that the $30 trillion elephant in the 
room isn’t going away. It’s just growing big-
ger. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position, sadly, to H.R. 2773. Although 
protecting our endangered species is 
truly a worthy cause, our country is 
not fiscally sound, and to commit $1.4 
billion a year in perpetuity is exactly 
the kind of spending that has landed us 
in the mess we are now in. 
Let me be clear: we do not have the 
money. In the 30 years since 1992, the 
national debt has increased from $4 
trillion to $30 trillion. Mr. Anderson 
notes in his article that: 
At that rate over the next 60 years, our 
debt would increase by more than 50-fold to 
surpass $1.5 quadrillion. In case one is won-
dering, a quadrillion is 1,000 trillions. 
Mr. Speaker, some might say: Just 
raise taxes. But, Mr. Speaker, the au-
thor of the article points out that, in 
fact, the Federal Government last year 
taxed over 100 times what it did in the 
first postwar year and spent nearly 200 
times as much. So taxes are not the 
problem. Spending is the problem. 
The $1.4 billion per year is perpetual. 
Now, under anyone’s measure, per-
petuity is a long time. Since this 
money will never be paid back, some 
might say like those deep in credit 
card debt: We will just pay the inter-
est. 
The interest on $1.5 billion for 30 
years at current rates of 3.4 percent is 
$51 million a year. But, Mr. Speaker, 
we have to look at the current total in-
terest bill. It is estimated to be almost 
$400 billion a year or about 8.7 percent 
of everything we spend. 
Why would we add to this enormous 
obligation? 
There is a quote by Ernest Heming-
way: How did you go bankrupt? 
The answer is: Gradually, then sud-
denly. 
Mr. Speaker, this is exactly how 
bankruptcy 
works. 
You 
can 
keep 
spending recklessly and rack up debts 
for a while—even a long while—but at 
some point, it comes to an end abrupt-
ly. We have ignored our Nation’s spend-
ing problems for far too long. We have 
been going bankrupt gradually, and I 
fear the day will come when we will go 
bankrupt immediately. 
We must correct this course. For this 
reason, I cannot support, sadly, this 
bill. 
b 1515 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to note that hunting and angling 
collectively support over $200 billion in 
economic activity annually, including 
over 1.5 million jobs as well as almost 
$15 billion in Federal tax revenue. 
My home State of Michigan, the 
Great Lakes State, is home to almost 
650,000 licensed hunters and over 1.1 
million licensed fishermen and -women 
as of last year. However, with over 40 
percent of freshwater fish at risk, and 
significant 
declines 
in 
game 
and 
nongame species that support local 
ecosystems, we need RAWA’s invest-
ments in on-the-ground conservation 
to support hunting and fishing for fu-
ture generations, which is why the 
major sportsmen’s groups, like the 
Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation 
and Ducks Unlimited, have endorsed 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. PA-
NETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of Recovering America’s Wild-
life Act. 
This is a proactive piece of bipartisan 
legislation that would help our State 
and Tribal fish and wildlife agencies 
with the recovery and conservation of 
close to 12,000 species of fish, wildlife, 
and plants. 
Now, I support this bill not only as 
the United States Representative for 
the central coast of California, a dis-
trict that values and cherishes our 
wildlife, but also as the vice chair of 
the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus. 
As some of the most passionate wild-
life conservationists across our coun-
try, many sportsmen and -women, in-
cluding those in the Congressional 
Sportsmen’s Foundation, no matter 
what their political persuasion, sup-
port this critical piece of legislation. 
In addition to enhancing the Pitt-
man-Robertson 
and 
Dingell-Johnson 
Acts, sportsmen and -women want to 
ensure that our species are protected 
and perpetuated. From bighorn sheep 
to the Sierra Nevada red fox, from the 
California condors to the coho salmon, 
and from moose to monarch butter-
flies, the intent of this legislation is to 
protect those and thousands of other 
iconic animals well before they need to 
be listed as endangered or threatened. 
This way, rather than impose burden-
some and costly regulations on fish and 
wildlife 
managers, 
sportsmen 
and 
-women, and private businesses, those 
species can be recovered and renewed 
well before any measures are man-
dated. 
Look, it is estimated that it costs 
the Federal Government more than $19 
million, on average, to recover a single 
species once it is listed, including $1 
million to just list the species and $18 
million for the science and habitat 
work. Let’s simply take 2,000 of the 
12,000 species this bill would help con-
serve, and it would cost the Federal 
Government at least $38 billion. This 
bill is a preventative measure to ensure 
that does not happen. 
Through this legislation, we would 
not only save billions of dollars by not 
having to list species, but we would 
save thousands of plants and animals 
by ensuring that they are protected. 
By providing millions of dollars in 
funding for the on-the-ground efforts,

we could recover, reintroduce, and re-
store wildlife, fish, flora, and fauna 
throughout our Nation. 
As many species face the growing 
threat of becoming extinct at acceler-
ated rates, due to changing global 
weather events and our climate crisis, 
this legislation and its proposed fund-
ing would protect those species well be-
fore they become endangered. 
That is why sportsmen, community 
members, and my country members 
support this bill, and that is why I urge 
my colleagues to do the same by voting 
for and passing the Recovering Amer-
ica’s Wildlife Act. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I know that we all like the idea of 
dynamic scoring, and I spend a lot of 
money on hunting and fishing myself, 
as do a lot of other Members of Con-
gress. But CBO, unfortunately, does 
not take that into account. 
I know we all think that this bill 
could help not have listings of endan-
gered species. But case studies clearly 
show that Federal money alone will 
not keep species off the endangered 
species list. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the record 
the CBO score from the Senate version 
of the language that is in this bill.

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? 
Yes. 
Increases on-budget deficits in any of the 
four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 
2033? $5 billion. 
Mandate Effects: 
Contains intergovernmental mandate? No. 
Contains private-sector mandate? No. 
The bill would: 
Make funds available to the Department of 
the Interior for grants and other support for 
wildlife conservation by states, territories, 
and Indian tribes. 
Allow the department to spend interest ac-
crued on certain unspent balances for wild-
life conservation. 
Estimated budgetary effects would mainly 
stem from: 
Spending without further appropriation on 
authorized activities. 
Spending 
of 
interest 
credited 
from 
amounts invested in Treasury securities. 
Bill summary: S. 2372 would amend the 
Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act 
and appropriate funds for the Department of 
the Interior to support efforts by state, 
local, and tribal governments to conserve en-
dangered and threatened species. The bill 
also would allow interest accrued on unspent 
balances in one account to be available with-
out further appropriation for those activi-
ties. 
The bill would require the President to 
provide the Congress each year with a list of 
threatened or endangered species and to esti-
mate the amount of funding allocated for 
their conservation. S. 2372 also would direct 
the Government Accountability Office to 
study the progress of states, territories, the 
District of Columbia, and Indian tribes in 
protecting endangered and threatened spe-
cies and to report its findings seven years 
after enactment. 
Estimated Federal cost: The estimated 
budgetary effect of S. 2372 is shown in Table 
1. The costs of the legislation fall within 
budget function 300 (natural resources and 
environment). 
Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO 
assumes that S. 2372 will be enacted near the 
end of fiscal year 2022. On that basis, CBO ex-
pects that outlays from funds provided in 
2022 would occur in 2023. Using information 
from the affected agencies and historical 
spending patterns for similar activities, CBO 
estimates that enacting S. 2372 would in-
crease direct spending by $14.1 billion over 
the 2022–2032 period.

Components may not sum to totals because of rounding; * = between zero and $500,000. 
S. 2372 would require annual reports whose cost would total $1 million over the 2022–2027 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. 
Direct spending: S. 2372 would establish 
new accounts in the Treasury, specify the 
amounts to be deposited into those accounts 
each year, and make the funds in those ac-
counts available to the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to spend without further appropriation. 
In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(USFWS) spent $713 million for similar ac-
tivities. 
Title I would make $850 million available 
in 2022 for USFWS to make grants to state, 
local, and tribal governments for wildlife 
conservation. The amounts made available 
would increase in 2023 and 2024. In 2025 and 
every year thereafter, title I would make $1.3 
billion available for those purposes. CBO es-
timates that enacting this title would in-
crease direct spending by $12.4 billion over 
the 2022–2032 period. 
Title II would make $97.5 million available 
in 2022 and every year thereafter for the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs to help Indian tribes 
conserve species on tribal land that have the 
greatest need for conservation. CBO esti-
mates that enacting this title would increase 
direct spending by $963 million over the 2022– 
2032 period. 
Title III would make $187.5 million avail-
able each year from 2022 through 2025 for 
USFWS to make grants to states and Indian 
tribes for the conservation of endangered and 
threatened species and to carry out other au-
thorities under the Endangered Species Act. 
A portion of those amounts—$75 million each 
year—would be made available to the Na-
tional Fish and Wildlife Foundation to re-
cover threatened or endangered species. CBO 
estimates that enacting this provision in 
title III would increase direct spending by 
$750 million over the 2022–2032 period. 
In addition, title III would direct the De-
partment of the Treasury to credit interest 
on unspent balances made available under 
that title to USFWS. That interest would be 
available to spend without further appropria-
tion for recovery efforts under the Endan-
gered Species Act. (Crediting interest to an 
account 
in 
the 
Treasury 
is 
an 
intragovemmental transfer and thus would 
have no budgetary effect but allowing the 
agency to spend the accrued amounts would 
increase direct spending.) Using the interest 
rates underlying the May 2022 baseline pro-
jections, CBO estimates that under this pro-
vision, $18 million would be accrued and 
spent over the 2022–2032 period.

The bill would permit USFWS to accept 
and spend donations. CBO estimates that the 
effect on net direct spending from donations 
would be negligible over the 2022–2032 period. 
The bill would authorize the transfer of 
some penalties collected under current law 
to the accounts established under title I and 
title II, but S. 2372 would not authorize any 
new penalty collections. 
Spending subject to appropriation: S. 2372 
would require the President to submit to the 
Congress lists of threatened or endangered 
species for which recovery efforts would be 
funded under the bill and to report annually 
on the amounts allocated for endangered spe-
cies recovery, interagency consultation, and 
conservation activities. Using information 
about similar activities, CBO estimates that 
producing the annual reports would cost $1 
million over the 2022–2027 period; any spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds. 
Under the bill, the Government Account-
ability Office would report in 2029 or 2030 on 
conservation efforts authorized in the bill. 
Based on the cost of similar reports, CBO es-
timates that the cost of that report would be 
insignificant. 
Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statu-
tory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes 
budget-reporting and enforcement proce-
dures for legislation affecting direct spend-
ing or revenues. The net changes in outlays 
that are subject to those pay-as-you-go pro-
cedures are shown in Table 2.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this

billion thereafter. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today opposed to the underlying bill. 
Americans are living in paralyzing 
fear, watching all of their household 
income get eaten up by the price of gas 
and household needs and watching 
their retirement security disappear in 
our new bear market. 
The Biden and House Democrat ap-
proach has been to spend their way out 
of every problem, and look where it has 
gotten us. 
The Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act is well intended. Of course, we con-
servationists support investments in 
our species. But there is still no pay- 
for. This is $1.4 billion in perpetuity, 
with no pay-for or offset. 
During committee markup, Repub-
licans on the Natural Resources Com-
mittee simply asked to offset the 
spending that continues to punish 
Americans. But Democrats declined to 
negotiate in good faith and are choos-
ing to aggravate inflation instead. 
However, I offer legislation that will 
actually help fix the problem. The En-
dangered Species Act Flexibility Act 
will give the Interior Secretary options 
to help endangered species without 
crippling our economy. 
Too often, the ESA is abused. Science 
is ignored, and the law is used as a 
weapon to stop much-needed develop-
ment. Take, for example, the northern 
long-eared bat. The bat’s massive range 
runs from Maine to Texas to Montana, 
with everything in between. You can 
see it on the map right here. 
Northern long-eared bats are, sadly, 
afflicted with white-nose syndrome, a 
disease caused by a fungus that inter-
rupts hibernation, leading to their 
death. The science is clear: This dis-
ease has nothing to do with human ac-
tivity. 
But because of declining population, 
the Fish and Wildlife Service is decid-
ing whether to uplist the species, 
which would severely restrict logging, 
mining, and infrastructure building, 
like roads, bridges, ports, and more. 
Would you like to spend that infra-
structure money on upgrading projects 
anywhere on this map? Good luck if 
the northern long-eared bat is listed as 
endangered. 
My ESA Flexibility Act will give the 
Interior Department the latitude to 
make species-specific habitat plans for 
endangered species, so we don’t punish 
Americans who need a transmission 
line to get reliable power or need a 
bridge upgrade to drive to work. 
I don’t think a single Member of Con-
gress here, across both aisles, would 
disagree that the Endangered Species 
Act is an imperfect law in desperate 
need of tweaks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. STAUBER. Therefore, I regret 
that my ESA Flexibility Act was not 
accepted as an amendment, but I look 
forward to the eventual passage of the 
ESA Flexibility Act into law. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before recognizing my colleague, I 
would like to talk about these costs 
and address the fact that dollars in-
vested properly do save dollars. 
I note that the droughts in the Amer-
ican West cost $8.6 billion just last 
year, according to NOAA, and that the 
impact of wildfire cost over $10 billion 
last year alone. 
Restoration efforts, which this bill 
would help do, that make habitats and 
communities more resilient to climate 
change have an exceptionally high re-
turn on investment, such as reducing 
drought and wildfire risks, increasing 
job opportunities, and growing local 
economies. 
Conservation and restoration of key 
habitats help reduce the threats of 
wildfires and help States conserve 
water and improve water quality, mak-
ing their water systems more resilient 
to the drought. 
Finally, full implementation of State 
and Tribal wildlife plans will help spe-
cies recover and be removed and even 
stay off the endangered species list, 
which is what we want, saving the U.S. 
taxpayers millions of dollars each year. 
The large economic and social bene-
fits of this legislation would boost our 
economy and help us deliver on our cli-
mate commitments for years to come 
as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my 
distinguished colleague from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s cour-
tesy, and I appreciate her leadership on 
this. And she is right. 
Looking at these issues in a com-
prehensive fashion, we see opportuni-
ties to not just save species, but to 
save money, and to deal with serious 
consequences that we are seeing. 
I am from the Pacific Northwest. We 
are in the middle of a climate crisis. 
Last year, we had all-time records 3 
days in a row for temperatures. And 
that same week, in British Columbia, 
they set an all-time record for Canada. 
And in the city that they set it, it 
burned down the next day. 
Climate change, loss of habitat, se-
vere weather, including wildfires, and 
the spread of invasive species, are tak-
ing their toll on animals, from fish and 
amphibians to birds and mammals. 
As co-chair of the Animal Protection 
Caucus, I am particularly aware of the 
importance of saving our at-risk wild-
life species. 
More than 1,600 are already listed as 
threatened or endangered under the 
Endangered Species Act because of our 
failure to act. 
Oregon alone is home to more than 50 
of these threatened and endangered 
species.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5517 
June 14, 2022 
In States like Oregon, in partnership 
with Tribes, we have identified thou-
sands more species that are at-risk and 
need conservation assistance. 
With States and conservation part-
ners working diligently to pass and de-
velop conservation plans, we can make 
a significant difference. But we lack 
dedicated annual comprehensive fund-
ing to implement the plans which 
would be cost-effective. 
With this bill, the Federal Govern-
ment is stepping up in full partnership 
with the Tribes, with the conservation 
communities, and wildlife advocates. 
The Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act will provide more than a billion 
dollars in dedicated annual funding for 
proactive, cost-effective model efforts, 
collaborative efforts by the States and 
Tribes to recover and protect at-risk 
species. 
I fear it is a false economy to some-
times engage in shortchanging these 
efforts. The long-term cost to the envi-
ronment, to our communities, is im-
mense. And I am pleased to support 
this legislation because I think we can 
change this dynamic. I strongly urge 
people to support its passage. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage the majority to put their esti-
mates to the test. Let’s make this a 
bill with a 7-year sunset like the 
amendment that I proposed. Let’s come 
back, look at it, and see if it really did 
save money. If it really did save spe-
cies, maybe we should fund it at more 
than $1.4 billion a year. Maybe we can 
find that funding with an offset. 
But the simple truth is it is all spec-
ulation right now, and we are getting 
ready to put a permanent mandatory 
spending program in place with no way 
to come back and have checks and bal-
ances on it without repealing the law. 
And how many times does that happen 
when Congress passes a law? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIF-
FANY). 
b 1530 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Regrettably, I will not be able to sup-
port this bill either. It is another $1.4 
billion of mandatory spending—no off-
sets, no sunset. This is another case of 
the runaway Biden inflation train gain-
ing speed. The only question at this 
point to the American people is how 
spectacular the crack-up is going to be, 
and the American people know that. 
When I go out and talk to them, I 
hear about two things: energy prices 
and inflation. 
Well, here we have got another $1.4 
billion that are going to be poured into 
the tinderbox of the train to send it ca-
reening down the rails even faster. The 
only question is how spectacular the 
crack-up is going to be. Unfortunately, 
the American people are going to suffer 
the consequences. 
The author of this bill just said that 
she would like to take some species off 
the endangered species list. There is 
one that can come off right now—right 
now—that has recovered. 
Representative BOEBERT and I pro-
posed an amendment to de-list the gray 
wolf. It has recovered. The gray wolf is 
in the ESA ‘‘Hotel California.’’ They 
can enter, but they never leave. 
Twenty-five wildlife scientists from 
the upper Midwest a decade ago said, 
you need to de-list the wolf. We put to-
gether an amendment for this bill, and 
it was not considered. 
Terribly unfortunate, because it is 
time for the Endangered Species Act to 
either be used properly and de-list a 
species like the gray wolf that is fully 
recovered, according to wildlife sci-
entists, or else the ESA itself has to be 
reformed. 
Those scientists, when you read their 
document that they wrote, specifically 
said, the Endangered Species Act is en-
dangered because it is not being used 
properly. 
Also, there is no language in this bill 
that prohibits funds from going to ac-
quiring new Federal lands. Think about 
it this way: If you have a neighbor that 
doesn’t repair their roof, it is leaking 
into their house, and they say we are 
going to go buy that lot next door. 
That, in effect, is what this bill will 
allow the Federal Government to do. 
We are seeing across America, in-
cluding in my district, that the Federal 
Government is not taking care of their 
lands appropriately. The Federal Gov-
ernment is becoming America’s slum-
lord. 
This bill has grant programs that 
even the most extreme environmental 
groups can apply for. Every time some 
taxpayer-funded, 
so-called 
corporate 
green group runs an ad, and you are 
going to see a lot of them here in 2022, 
claiming the sky is falling, just re-
member: You may have paid for it, and 
you may pay twice because you will 
get hit with inflation as a result of 
spending that the American people 
cannot afford. 
I thank the gentleman for the oppor-
tunity to be able to testify on this bill. 
Unfortunately, I will not be able to 
support it, and I hope in the future 
that we can do better. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her leadership on this issue. 
I rise in support of the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act, bipartisan leg-
islation I am proud to cosponsor, that 
aims to make the most significant in-
vestment in wildlife and habitat con-
servation in a generation. 
Across Washington State, across our 
whole country, we are facing wide-
spread species decline that doesn’t just 
threaten the health of our ecosystems. 
It threatens the recreation and tourism 
and fishing industries that our commu-
nities rely on. 
That is why Democrats and Repub-
licans support taking bold action to 
implement conservation efforts to con-
serve and restore habitat, to reintro-
duce native species, and to mitigate 
wildlife risk. 
This bill is critical to helping our 
State and our Tribal wildlife managers 
put conservation measures in place to 
protect species before they become 
threatened or endangered. 
On top of that, this bill will help us 
combat threats to ecosystems, includ-
ing 
the 
European 
green 
crab, 
an 
invasive species that is destroying es-
sential marine habitat for Dungeness 
crab and Pacific salmon and threat-
ening our shellfish industry that so 
many of the families that I represent 
depend on. 
Get this: Last year, more than 102,000 
European green crabs were caught in 
Puget Sound and along Washington’s 
coast. That was an astronomical 5,500 
percent increase from 2019. 
In response to that explosion in the 
green crab population, a series of dis-
aster declarations were made by the 
Lummi Nation and the Makah Tribe 
concerning the green crabs’ impact on 
Tribal culture and on their economies, 
and another a disaster was declared by 
the State of Washington to mobilize 
more resources. 
While our Tribes and States and local 
partners 
and 
small 
businesses 
are 
working diligently to protect our re-
gion against the explosion of these 
invasive species, they need more re-
sources to improve detection, increase 
control efforts, and pursue eradication 
of this invasive species. 
This burden shouldn’t fall entirely on 
the backs of our Tribes or on local tax-
payers’ backs. The Federal Govern-
ment can and should step up and be a 
better partner in this effort, and this 
bill will do that. That is why I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bi-
partisan legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding the time. 
As I speak, the West is literally burn-
ing. Major infernos are devastating 
States like California, Arizona, and 
Alaska. 
In New Mexico, the Hermit’s Peak 
fire became the largest in State history 
nearly 1 month ago and is still not 
fully contained. This catastrophic fire 
has burned over 320,000 acres and cost 
taxpayers a whopping $224 million in 
fire suppression costs. 
In total, over 2.6 million acres have 
burned this year already, putting us on 
a pace to surpass every wildfire season 
in the past decade. 
Homes have burned to the ground. 
Thousands 
of 
brave 
wildland 
fire-
fighters have put their lives on the 
line. Hundreds of millions of dollars 
have been spent trying to tame fires so 
intense, they create their own weather 
systems known as firenados. Why? 
The answer is simple. The lack of ac-
tive forest management and decades of 
fire suppression and mismanagement 
have left our Nation’s forests as dry as

powder kegs and ready to ignite from a 
single spark. 
In the last decade, mismanagement 
caused over 70 million acres to burn, 
and we have no signs of it slowing 
down. According to the U.S. Forest 
Service, over one billion—that is bil-
lion with a b—acres across the country 
are at risk of experiencing severe 
wildfires. 
That is why I am offering this 
amendment. My amendment seeks to 
add forest management activities such 
as mechanical thinning and prescribed 
burning that enhance or create wildlife 
habitat—that is, enhance or create 
wildlife habitat—or reduce the risk of 
destruction to wildlife habitat due to 
wildfires as acceptable projects under 
the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act. 
Catastrophic fires remain one of the 
single greatest threats to wildlife in 
Western States, such as my home State 
of Idaho. 
In California, the Los Angeles Times 
reported in 2020 that the Bobcat fire 
turned one of the most abundant wild-
life habitats with lush canyons and a 
mixture of rare and endangered species 
into an ‘‘apocalypse’’ that looked like 
ground zero after a nuclear explosion. 
Experts believe this fire would reverse 
decades of conservation efforts. 
In Oregon, the 2020 wildfires have 
burned over 360,000 acres of critical 
spotted owl habitat, pushing the spe-
cies into what researchers call an ex-
tinction vortex. 
Catastrophic 
wildfires 
recently 
forced the State of Washington Depart-
ment of Fish and Wildlife to rec-
ommend moving the greater sage- 
grouse from threatened to endangered 
status in their State. This is the very 
action that RAWA seeks to prevent. 
These wildfires also killed nearly 
half of the State’s endangered pigmy 
rabbit population. A Seattle Times re-
port stated that rabbits had asphyx-
iated as the fire, in its fury, devoured 
oxygen from the atmosphere. There 
was nothing but ash and dust. No 
movement. No footprints. There was no 
chance anything survived. 
Is this what recovering America’s 
wildlife looks like, choking animals in 
suffocating smoke, burning them alive? 
These catastrophic wildland fires are 
polluting our air, degrading our water, 
releasing massive amounts of carbon 
into the atmosphere, and turning rich 
and diverse wildlife habitat into barren 
moonscapes. 
Incentivizing better, more active for-
est management through my amend-
ment will create healthier ecosystems 
and abundant habitat for diverse wild-
life. That is exactly what this bill is in-
tended to do. If we truly care about re-
covering America’s wildlife, then you 
will support my amendment. 
If we adopt this, we will instruct the 
Committee on Natural Resources to 
add my amendment to include the for-
est management activities that mod-
ify, improve, enhance, or create wild-
life habitat or protect wildlife habitat 
from wildfires as acceptable uses of 
funding under this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Idaho? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DINGELL. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Idaho for 
making a point that it is really the un-
derlying reason that we should be—or 
the underlying question we should be 
talking about is, Why do we need to re-
cover America’s wildlife? 
It is because we have messed up 
badly. We have mismanaged our Fed-
eral lands. Catastrophic wildfires run 
rampant. That does nothing to help 
wildlife habitat, and it is sad that we 
are actually here looking for funding 
and ways to fix something that we 
should have already fixed, something 
that we shouldn’t have broken in the 
first place. 
I think there is a way to recover 
wildlife, if we would just simply man-
age the habitat that the wildlife lives 
in. That is the purpose of this bill, but 
it is going to take some worldview 
changes, and the so-called environ-
mental groups that are pushing to stop 
the management activity are going to 
have to allow this activity to take 
place. 
It doesn’t matter how much funding 
we put out from the Federal Govern-
ment; we are going to continue to see 
wildlife habitat destroyed, and we are 
going to continue to see the loss of 
wildlife. 
So it is not a problem that simply 
throwing money at will fix, and it is, 
again, a problem where we should put a 
program in place, come back and 
evaluate it, and decide whether we 
want to continue the program based on 
the merits of the successes of it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I say to my colleague, I deeply agree 
that these fires are horrific in what 
they are doing to our natural resources 
and our habitat, but that is why this 
bill is so important. 
It is not Washington telling the 
States or the Native lands or terri-
tories in the Native lands what to do. 
It is the State wildlife plans that are 
being drafted at the local level where 
they know what needs to be done that 
we will be funding and trying to pre-
vent fires like that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the very distinguished 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA), the chairman of the Committee 
on Natural Resources, who leads all of 
us on so many of these issues. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 2773, Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act. I thank Rep-
resentative DINGELL and her colleagues 
that have worked diligently on this 
legislation for a considerable amount 
of time. 
In the midst of the species extinction 
crisis that we have, accelerated cli-
mate change, the loss of biodiversity, 
droughts, the wildfires that we just 
heard about, it is important to note 
that this legislation was built from the 
ground up; 1,800 organizations, as di-
verse as Duke Energy on one side of 
the political spectrum and the Envi-
ronmental Defense Fund on the other 
side, both agreeing that the approach 
of this legislation is the right ap-
proach; 180-plus cosponsors represented 
in a bipartisan fashion. 
This bill before us today will trans-
form the state of wildlife conservation 
in our country. 
As we know, America’s wildlife faces 
numerous threats, including habitat 
loss, pollution, climate change, wild-
fire, drought, invasive species, and 
emerging diseases. 
It provides a historic $1.3 billion of 
dedicated funding for States and terri-
tories and $97 million for Tribes to as-
sist in their efforts to conserve, re-
store, and protect wildlife and habitat 
each year. 
With that protection comes the resil-
iency for habitat and the overall resil-
iency for communities and our environ-
ment. 
In the long run, this investment will 
save taxpayers money. It creates jobs, 
promotes tourism, and provides safety 
and resilience to those communities 
across our country. 
Through habitat conservation and 
restoration, this bill makes habitats 
and communities much more resilient 
to the ongoing and accelerated issue of 
climate change. This is an important 
piece of legislation for each and every 
State, territory, and Tribe in our coun-
try, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
b 1545 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle, my Republican colleagues are fis-
cal conservatives when they are not in 
the majority. When they are in the ma-
jority, that is not the pattern of behav-
ior. 
At the present time, nothing should 
be done is what is being preached: 
Nothing should be done about the cli-
mate crisis. 
Nothing should be done about wild-
life extinction. 
Nothing should be done about Janu-
ary 6 and our democracy. That was 
merely a mirage, a walk in the park 
that we should all forget. 
Nothing should be done about our 
children and the danger that they are 
exposed to in our very schools. 
Nothing should be done about the ris-
ing healthcare costs and prescription 
drug costs. 
We can’t do anything because of in-
flation and the rising gas prices, so the 
best thing to do is to do nothing. 
Well, my colleagues, I support H.R. 
2773 because it does something. It does 
something in a bipartisan, comprehen-
sive way. If my colleagues want to talk

about climate change, if they want to 
talk about droughts, if they want to 
talk about wildfire, if they want to 
talk about fiscally prudent things to 
do, let’s talk about this bill today. 
Support it with dedicated funding. 
Make the investment that will guar-
antee the dividends for ourselves and 
future generations. 
I applaud Representative DINGELL 
and all the work of her colleagues and 
this piece of legislation, and I urge its 
support and urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of 
talk about this bill being bipartisan. 
The original House version of the text 
did have 42 Republican cosponsors on 
it, which is a sizable number. That is a 
bipartisan bill. 
There will still be Republicans who 
vote for this version, but as long as we 
are in the business of estimating today, 
I am going to estimate that it won’t be 
the 42 cosponsors of the original text, 
which, again, was supplanted by the 
Senate version that didn’t send all the 
money to the State and Tribal govern-
ments. It sent the money to U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife, part of the funding to 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife. 
I have talked to some of the Repub-
lican Members who have cosponsored 
the bill, and their understanding was 
that the pay-for was going to be 
worked out. If we would just sponsor 
the bill, we would get the pay-fors 
worked out. We were told the bill will 
go to the floor, and we will work out 
the pay-fors. Well, here is the bill on 
the floor and there is still no pay-fors. 
It is still permanent mandatory spend-
ing, $1.4 billion a year. 
If this bill passes out of the House, 
and if for some reason it doesn’t make 
it through the Senate and become law, 
then I hope to come back and work on 
a bill that has the same objectives but 
is fiscally responsible, a bill that has 
pay-fors, a bill that is not borrowing 
from our children, and a bill that is not 
permanent, one that actually gives 
Congress the authority to have over-
sight and to come back and analyze the 
language, to analyze the success of it, 
and make changes as needed as we go 
on. 
We do this with the farm bill, we do 
it with other bills. I am not sure why 
we can’t do it with Recovering Amer-
ica’s Wildlife Act because it is a very 
important subject. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I say to my colleague, we have 
worked in good faith. We will continue 
to work in good faith. 
The Senate, which doesn’t work to-
gether as closely at times the way we 
do, has negotiated a legacy fund that is 
a bipartisan negotiated provision by 
the chairman and the ranking member 
of the Senate Committee on Environ-
ment and Public Works. Actually, 
more Republicans voted for that than 
Democrats did. 
This bill has been supported by a 
broad cross-section of Senate Repub-
licans and Senate Democrats. Quite 
frankly, there are some of your Senate 
Republican colleagues who will only 
support it the way it is now. I have 
talked to many Republicans who want 
to see this bill go through. I don’t 
know how the final vote will be today. 
I know people want to support it. 
By the way, it addresses a shared 
goal, what the Senate did, that third 
provision helping to move species off of 
the ESA listings more quickly. It con-
tains guardrails on the use of funds 
that I know were important to my Re-
publican colleagues. These include pro-
hibitions on the use of funds to make 
any listing or critical habitat deter-
mination relating to the endangered or 
threatened status of any species or to 
acquire any Federal land, which I know 
is really important on your side. 
The broad coalition supporting the 
bill, including the State wildlife agen-
cies and sportsmen’s groups, have also 
backed all these provisions. We are not 
done. If the bill passes the House, we 
will go to conference with the Senate. 
We will all be at that table. But the 
time is now. We need to get this done. 
We have lost almost 3 billion birds 
since 1970. We are losing 40 percent of 
our fish. You and I both fish. I am not 
as great a hunter as you guys are, but 
I was married to one. But they know 
what is happening. The time for action 
is now. 
Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. In closing, I just want to go back 
through the facts as we know them. 
We know that we need to do better 
habitat management, whether it is for-
est, 
rangelands, 
oceans, 
rivers, 
or 
lakes. We know there are areas where 
we need to manage better. The intent 
of this bill is to let those management 
activities be done by the people who do 
it best, State and Tribal agencies. 
I think there is a huge agreement in 
the 
House, 
both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats alike, but that is a good 
thing. The problem we have with the 
bill, though, is the way that we are 
going to implement it in the financial 
times that we are in now, and looking 
back at history and seeing how we got 
in the condition that we are in. The 
spending problem in this country is not 
discretionary spending. It is not the 
appropriation bills that we should be 
debating and approving every year. 
It is the mandatory spending. It is 
the cruise control programs that pre-
vious Congresses have put in place that 
are driving the deficit. Over 70 percent 
of our debt is due to mandatory spend-
ing. And here we are with record debt, 
record inflation, and we are talking 
about putting more on the mandatory 
side of the equation. 
There is a path where we could get 
huge support. We could probably do 
this, maybe even do it on a unanimous 
consent bill, and that would be if the 
majority would accept the amendment 
that I offered in the Rules Committee. 
As the ranking member on the com-
mittee, I offered an amendment that 
would bring a lot of our Members on 
board, and it simply put a 7-year sun-
set in, make it an authorization and let 
the Appropriations Committee do their 
work. 
We are not even going to vote on 
that. We are not even going to put it on 
the floor to see where the Members of 
the body are at. The Rules Committee 
took that off of the table. So we have 
no choice. No choice but to recommend 
that we vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, that we 
come back to the table, that we look at 
something that everybody can agree 
on. Not just on the authorization, but 
on how we fund the bill. I think we can 
get there. 
I hate to take it out of the House’s 
hands and put it into the Senate’s 
hands when we didn’t give it a full ef-
fort on how to not only craft the legis-
lation on what needs to be done on the 
ground, but how to pay for it, how to 
be fiscally responsible going forward. 
So, again, I support the idea. I don’t 
support the way we are paying for it. I 
have to recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote. I en-
courage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for the constructive debate 
and input that we have had to date on 
Recovering America’s Wildlife Act. 
This legislation is historic, and our 
shared efforts today will help move us 
one step closer to a bold solution to the 
biodiversity crisis and will establish 
conservation measures that will endure 
for generations, which I know we both 
care about. 
The Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act has strong bipartisan support, the 
backing of hundreds of meetings of 
sportsmen’s groups, hunting and fish-
ing advocates, conservation organiza-
tions, environmental advocates, busi-
nesses, and countless others. 
It will fund proactive conservation 
measures that will benefit every State 
and territory and contains a strong 
Tribal title to support Tribal organiza-
tions’ efforts to protect wildlife on tens 
of millions of acres of land. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Recovering America’s 
Wildlife Act. It will make a difference 
in every congressional district in this 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2773, the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act. I thank the gentle-
woman from Michigan, Congresswoman DIN-
GELL, and Chairman GRIJALVA for their leader-
ship in moving this critical legislation through 
our Natural Resources Committee and to the 
Floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5520 
June 14, 2022 
The world is in the middle of an extinction 
crisis and, unfortunately, my state is at its cen-
ter. As a result of climate change, invasive 
species and other environmental stressors, 
our islands have earned the unfortunate dis-
tinction of becoming the endangered species 
capitol of the world. Of the 1,225 endangered 
species listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, nearly 500 are found in Hawaii. Just 
last year, nine more of Hawaii’s endemic spe-
cies were officially reclassified as extinct. 
The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act will 
provide $1.3 billion in support to states, terri-
tories and tribes to address wildlife conserva-
tion. The estimated $60 million in annual fund-
ing to Hawaii will be essential to my state’s 
ability to save our imperiled biodiversity and 
will increase the chance that species like the 
‘l‘iwi (a Hawaiian Honeycreeper), ‘O¯ pe‘ape‘a 
(the Hawaiian Hoary Bat) and Ka¯huli (Hawai-
ian tree snail) survive. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this leg-
islation. Mahalo.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL) and the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each will control 
10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this en 
bloc consists of four amendments: 
Amendment No. 3, offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Texas; amendment No. 
7, offered by the gentleman from Geor-
gia; amendment No. 6, offered by the 
gentlewoman from Washington; and 
amendment No. 1, offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida. 
Amendment No. 3, offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Texas, requires the 
Secretary of the Interior to submit a 
report to the House Committee on Nat-
ural Resources and the Senate Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works outlining the dollar amount of 
grants, contracts, and subcontracts, 
and the percent of total awards and 
grants that were awarded or allocated 
under RAWA to HBCUs and minority- 
serving 
institutions, 
minority- 
and 
women-owned businesses, and commu-
nity-based organizations serving mi-
nority communities. 
Current conservation and restoration 
practices underutilize the breadth of 
traditional, 
indigenous, 
and 
local 
knowledge found in our communities. 
To be successful in our restoration and 
conservation goals, we must use all of 
the tools at our disposal. 
Amendment No. 7, offered by the gen-
tleman from Georgia, adds activities 
that support native pollinator con-
servation and restoration to the list of 
appropriate uses of funds from the 
Wildlife Conservation and Restoration 
Subaccount. 
While many State wildlife action 
plans already include projects that will 
conserve and restore native pollinator 
species and habitat, we recognize the 
important role that pollinators play in 
ecosystem functionality. 
Twenty-seven States included mon-
arch butterflies in their State wildlife 
action plans, and thousands of other 
pollinators are identified as species of 
greatest conservation need. 
Our pollinators are at risk, and it is 
important that we not forget the im-
portant impact they have on our land-
scape. 
Amendment No. 6, offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Washington, clarifies 
that the Wildlife Conservation and Res-
toration Subaccount funds may include 
conservation 
infrastructure 
projects 
related to the protection and conserva-
tion of a species of greatest conserva-
tion need and the habitat of those spe-
cies. 
Conservation infrastructure projects 
are cost-effective methods to enhance 
conservation and build climate resil-
iency. They can protect against exces-
sive heat and coastal storms while im-
proving wildlife habitat and carbon se-
questration. 
Conservation infrastructure projects 
improve the health and management of 
ecosystems so that they provide impor-
tant benefits and services. Examples 
include managing stormwater runoff, 
improving water quality for wildlife, 
restoring wildlife habitat in the built 
environment, and attracting beneficial 
species. 
b 1600 
Finally, amendment No. 1, offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida, broad-
ens the appropriate uses of Wildlife 
Conservation 
and 
Restoration 
Sub-
account funds to include using innova-
tive technologies, tools, strategies, or 
collaborative partnerships that accel-
erate, expand, or replicate effective 
and measurable recovery efforts for 
species of the greatest conservation 
need and endangered species. 
Supporting the implementation and 
expansion of new, creative conserva-
tion methods is of the utmost impor-
tance if we wish to interrupt the ongo-
ing mass extinction event. In this time 
of need, our species and ecosystems 
need all the help we can provide. Fund-
ing innovative ideas will fill the gaps 
left by traditional conservation meth-
ods while spurring research and cre-
ating jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5521 
June 14, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I also rise in support of this 
amendment en bloc. 
None of the amendments included in 
this amendment en bloc would add 
more spending to this bill. Three of the 
amendments in this en bloc amend 
title I by adding more flexibility for 
State fish and wildlife agencies when 
they make conservation investments 
funded under this bill. 
These amendments do not impose 
new mandates, but rather, provide 
States more tools to manage wildlife 
as they see fit. 
Mr. SCOTT’s amendment on helping 
pollinators and their habitats will en-
hance ongoing efforts aimed at helping 
the monarch butterfly. Pollinators are 
critical 
to 
ecosystem 
conservation 
around the world. That is why my Re-
publican colleagues and I have continu-
ously supported the Candidate Con-
servation Agreement with Assurances 
for the monarch butterfly, which al-
lows private companies and landowners 
to contribute to proactive conserva-
tion. 
The 
amendment 
from 
Congress-
woman 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK
rec-
ommends that States prioritize funding 
toward innovative strategies and part-
nerships to recover species. I believe 
that innovation is critical for ensuring 
widespread species recovery. The cur-
rent species recovery framework under 
the Endangered Species Act is not only 
outdated, but it is broken and needs in-
novation. 
Republicans have offered numerous 
ideas to use innovation to spur species 
recovery. One idea from Representative 
HERRELL of New Mexico would help 
incentivize proactive Candidate Con-
servation Agreements that allow pri-
vate companies and landowners to con-
tribute toward at-risk species con-
servation through their own dollars 
and efforts. Sounds like a good, com-
monsense idea. 
The outdated Endangered Species 
Act has become a top-down govern-
ment approach that rarely works to 
help species or people. Innovative ap-
proaches like Ms. HERRELL’s are much 
needed. 
I was disappointed to see that the 
majority discarded amendments like 
Ms. HERRELL’s without even giving us 
the chance to debate its merits on the 
House floor. 
Representative STAUBER also had an 
innovative idea to update the Endan-
gered Species Act that he offered as an 
amendment. His amendment would 
have provided the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service with the flexibility to uti-
lize so-called 4(d) rules for endangered 
species. Under a 4(d) rule, the Sec-
retary of the Interior can issue a rule 
for individual species that tailors pro-
tections to that species’ conservation 
and recovery. Unfortunately, again, 
the majority also ignored that amend-
ment. 
The amendment by Congresswoman 
SCHRIER is also included in this en bloc 
by encouraging States to invest in 
‘‘conservation infrastructure projects.’’ 
While States already have flexibility to 
decide how to spend the funding pro-
vided in title I of the bill, this amend-
ment would give them the option to in-
vest in natural solutions, such as buff-
er strips, wetlands—one of my favorite 
things—planting trees, and other nat-
ural solutions to environmental chal-
lenges. 
Lastly, 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON 
LEE’s amendment would require the 
Secretary of the Interior to issue a re-
port within 1 year of this bill’s enact-
ment, detailing the percentage of total 
awards and grants that were awarded 
or allocated to institutions serving mi-
nority communities. 
While I support this amendment and 
its reporting requirement, I have bad 
news for the sponsor. Because the bill 
lacks a sunset provision, there is little 
incentive and recourse for Congress to 
fix any problems. In other words, if the 
reports required by this amendment 
highlight a glaring flaw with the pro-
grams being carried out under this bill, 
there will be no guarantee that Con-
gress will fix the problem. The same is 
true for the State reports required 
under the bill. 
For that reason, I offered a common-
sense amendment that would have in-
cluded a 7-year sunset to ensure that 
Congress would have to fix any flaws 
associated with this new program. Un-
fortunately, as I stated earlier, my 
amendment was also blocked by the 
majority. 
This bill and the process to rush this 
bill to the floor today are unfortunate. 
It could have been avoided, but at least 
the amendments included in this en 
bloc do not spend any more taxpayer 
money and provide some needed ac-
countability. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the en bloc, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad we found an area of agreement 
this afternoon. I think we have more 
agreement than people realize. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), the author of one of these very 
critical amendments. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to be yielded to by the 
gentlewoman. I thank her for cham-
pioning this outstanding legislation, 
and I thank my good friend for ac-
knowledging the en bloc. 
I will say that there is good news. 
The good news is that the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act is once-in-a- 
generation funding for the conserva-
tion of threatened species of animals 
and plants as well as habitat preserva-
tion. I will discuss the importance of it 
as I also present to the body my 
amendment. 
Let me, first of all, say I pay tribute 
to Ellison, 7 years old, and to Roy, 7 
years old, my twin grandchildren who 
love every species that they can find 
within their backyard or anyplace else 
that you would take them. I see in 
their lifetime the vision of this legisla-
tion. They love the outdoors. They love 
to see crawling things, and they are a 
boy and a girl. 
Yet, what are we facing today? The 
world is facing an unprecedented loss 
of wildlife. Bird populations have de-
clined almost 30 percent in the U.S. 
and Canada since 1970. Over 40 percent 
of America’s freshwater fish are at risk 
of extinction, and State agencies have 
identified 12,000 species of wildlife in 
need of conservation. 
The Speaker pro tempore knows that 
Texas and Louisiana experienced a cat-
astrophic oil spill some years ago. I re-
member visiting oyster fishermen and 
others who were devastated. We need 
to get in there and make a difference. 
Mr. Speaker, 12,000 species are cur-
rently identified as endangered in the 
United States, and 1,300 of them are in 
my State of Texas. As I said, fishermen 
are still crying out for help. Climate 
change poses an unprecedented chal-
lenge to plant and animal species due 
to wildfires, droughts, floods, and tem-
perature shifts. Hurricane Harvey dev-
astated the coast and the opportunities 
for wildlife. The resulting threat to 
biodiversity has the potential to dis-
rupt our ecosystem and, with it, human 
quality of life and sustainability. 
Urban sprawl as well as development 
of suburbs and exurbs also encroach on 
the habitat that supports biodiversity, 
and it has ripple effects that compound 
the gradation of our environment from 
climate change. 
We want to be hanging in there with 
fisherman, sportsmen, bikers, hikers— 
bikers in the appropriate atmosphere, 
but hikers in particular. 
Our children deserve to know the 
natural beauty of their country. They 
deserve to see the beauty of wildlife. 
They deserve to be good custodians of 
that, and the children need to be di-
verse. 
So the amendment that I offer is to 
ensure that children will continue to 
spend their days fishing, gardening 
alongside bees, watching the migratory 
birds, but also looking at the wilds and 
the species that are in them. 
The Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act provides $1.3 billion in funding to 
protect our Nation’s wildlife, $50 mil-
lion of which will go to Texas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this is a great effort. My amendment 
fixes and adds to this. By adding title 
IV, we stipulate the Secretary of the 
Interior must, no later than 1 year 
after passage, provide a report on the 
dollar amount of grants, contracts, and 
subcontracts that were allocated to 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities, Hispanic-serving educational in-
stitutions, tribally controlled colleges 
and universities, and women- and mi-
nority-owned businesses. 
My amendment goes into the broad 
span of Americans, brings them into

the arena, and gives a needed invest-
ment in people of color who deserve to 
be not only included but intentionally 
targeted in new conservation invest-
ments to open their eyes, to give them 
the opportunity, and to ensure our Na-
tive American friends are included as 
well along with women- and minority- 
owned businesses. Let them have an in-
vestment as well. 
In addition, with the enactment of 
this legislation, my amendment would 
create a framework for prioritizing his-
torically disadvantaged groups in envi-
ronmental efforts, bring them, again, 
into the fold, which should be rep-
licated in future efforts. This is an im-
portant step. 
I want you to listen to me, histori-
cally Black colleges and Hispanic-serv-
ing institutions, this is also a day for 
you. Support this legislation, and we 
will expand and build and support 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, as a staunch advocate for the 
environment I rise in support of the Recov-
ering America’s Wildlife Act of 2021. 
This bill provides once-in-a-generation fund-
ing for the conservation of threatened species 
of animals and plants, as well as habitat pres-
ervation. 
12,000 species are currently identified as 
endangered in the United States. 1,300 of 
those are in my home state of Texas. 
In addition to providing $1.3 billion in fund-
ing to protect our nation’s wildlife—$50 million 
of which will go to Texas—the Recovering 
America’s Wildlife Act of 2021 designates por-
tion of this federal funding for special projects 
that revitalize species facing a conservation 
need. 
In addition to my support of H.R. 2773, I 
rise to put forth an important amendment to 
today’s legislation. 
Firstly, this legislation does not stipulate sig-
nificant transparency regarding the handling of 
these funds. 
Secondly, nowhere in this bill does it require 
the Department of the Interior to include peo-
ple of color. 
My amendment fixes both of those issues. 
By adding Title IV, we stipulate the Secretary 
of the Interior must, no later than one year 
after passage, provide a report on the dollar 
amount of grants, contracts, and subcontracts 
that were allocated to Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities, Hispanic-serving edu-
cational institutions, Tribally controlled colleges 
and universities, and women and minority 
owned business. 
My amendment addresses a needed invest-
ment in people of color who deserve to be not 
only included, but intentionally targeted in new 
conservation investments. 
Passage of this bill will encourage fairness 
in the allocation of contract, subcontract, and 
grant dollars, as well as greater transparency 
into the details of those allocations. 
Climate change poses unprecedented chal-
lenges to plant and animal species due to 
wildfires, droughts, floods, and temperature 
shifts. 
The resulting threat to biodiversity has the 
potential to disrupt our ecosystem, and with it, 
human quality-of-life and sustainability. 
Urban sprawl as well as development of 
suburbs and exurbs also encroach on the 
habitat that supports biodiversity, and it has 
ripple effects that compound the degradation 
of our environment from climate change. 
This bill takes these problems seriously and 
provides funding for programs that are essen-
tial for human sustainability as well as the re-
silience of plants and animals. 
Our children deserve to know the natural 
beauty of their country. 
They deserve to grow up in an America 
teeming with wild strength, diversity, and 
beauty. 
They deserve to embrace the long American 
history of wildlife sportsmanship, recreation, 
and appreciation. 
By supporting H.R. 2773, we ensure that 
childhood days spent fishing at the lake, gar-
dening alongside bees, or watching the flight 
of migratory birds are not things of the past. 
Through this bill we preserve the heritage of 
our country. 
Additionally, enactment of this legislation 
would create a framework for prioritizing his-
torically disadvantaged groups in environ-
mental efforts that should be replicated in fu-
ture efforts. 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
again, I support this group of amend-
ments en bloc and encourage a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
en bloc package as well as the bill upon 
final passage, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL).

AMENDMENTS EN BLOC NO. 2 OFFERED BY MRS. 
DINGELL OF MICHIGAN 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, I offer 
amendments en bloc. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendments 
en bloc. 
Amendments en bloc No. 2 consisting 
of amendment Nos. 2 and 8, printed in 
part D of House Report 117–366, offered 
by Mrs. DINGELL of Michigan: 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. BENTZ OF 
OREGON 
Page 34, after line 13, add the following 
new subsection: 
(k) ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.—Of the funds 
made available under each of paragraphs (1) 
and (3) of subsection (e), not more than 1.85 
percent may be used by the Secretary for ad-
ministrative costs. 
AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MR. TIFFANY OF 
WISCONSIN 
Page 34, after line 13, add the following 
new subsection: 
(k) INSPECTOR GENERAL.—There is author-
ized to be appropriated to the Office of the 
Inspector General of the Department of the 
Interior 1⁄2 of 1 percent of the amounts made 
available under subsection (c) for the pur-
poses of providing oversight and account-
ability with respect to expenditure of funds 
authorized under such subsection, to remain 
available until September 30, 2029. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL) and the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each will control 
10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, en bloc 
No. 2 consists of two good-government 
amendments offered by my Republican 
colleagues: amendment No. 2 offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon and amend-
ment No. 8 offered by the gentleman 
from Wisconsin. 
Amendment No. 2 stipulates that no 
more than 1.85 percent of funds can be 
used for administrative costs in the 
grant programs authorized by title III. 
The purpose of the Recovering Amer-
ica’s Wildlife Act is to fund on-the- 
ground efforts that are focused on con-
serving and restoring wildlife and habi-
tat. This 1.85 percent cap will ensure 
that these dollars are being used to-
ward actions that create the most im-
pact. 
Amendment No. 8 offered by the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin requires that 
half of 1 percent of the money in the 
Endangered 
Species 
Recovery 
and 
Habitat Conservation Legacy Fund be 
directed to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Inte-
rior to oversee the expenditure of the 
fund. 
This amendment will ensure that 
money from the Endangered Species 
Recovery and Habitat Conservation 
Legacy Fund is used appropriately and 
in a manner that is in line with the 
spirit of this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on en bloc No. 2, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in wholehearted support of these 
amendments en bloc, which include 
amendments from our colleagues from 
Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) and from Wis-
consin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
These amendments would ensure that 
the funds provided in title III are sub-
ject to the same overhead cap require-
ments and oversight measures as title 
I. 
The original point of this bill was to 
empower States and Tribes to carry 
out species conservation, not set up an-
other Washington, D.C.-based Federal 
program, which is now what the bill 
does. Not only does title III change 
that intent by giving more than $180 
million annually in the first 4 years to 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but 
it was also added at the Rules Com-
mittee and was not part of the bill that 
the Committee on Natural Resources 
marked up. Because the Committee on 
Natural 
Resources

chance to debate this title when we 
marked up the original bill, we did not 
have the opportunity to add these 
good-governance amendments to it like 
we did for titles I and II. 
I believe that title III should be re-
moved altogether. Unfortunately, Rep-
resentative 
MOORE’s 
amendment, 
which would have removed title III, 
was not made in order, so we didn’t 
even get the chance to debate it, much 
less vote on it today. 
b 1615 
In the absence of that amendment, 
the least we can do is ensure funds al-
located by title III are being spent re-
sponsibly and with some oversight. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
support of the amendments, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for saying 
it quite well. The least we can do here 
is make sure that with these funds we 
try to have some oversight and respon-
sibility in terms of how they are going 
to be spent. I thank the author for in-
cluding this amendment in the bill. 
If there is no pay-for, then there 
must be some measure of account-
ability for the expenditure of these 
funds ensuring the Department of the 
Interior Inspector General’s office has 
the proper resources to monitor this 
spending. 
Unfortunately, the bill in its current 
form has no sunset on the mandatory 
spending of $1.4 billion, so I thank the 
gentlewoman for including this in the 
package. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of my amendment No. 8. 
This fiscally responsible amendment 
would establish a 1.85 percent adminis-
trative cap for the Department of the 
Interior when implementing title III of 
this bill. 
Title I of the bill, which provides 
funding to State fish and wildlife de-
partments for species conservation, in-
cludes a 1.85 percent administrative 
cap. 
Title II of the bill, which covers Trib-
al Wildlife Conservation and Restora-
tion, includes a 3 percent administra-
tive cap for the Department of the In-
terior. 
However, as currently drafted, title 
III does not have an administrative 
cap. 
The original intent of this bill was to 
provide States with funding to con-
serve species of greatest conservation 
need. 
Unfortunately, the majority decided 
to ignore the committee process by 
airdropping in title III to give more 
funding to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. 
Not only did they circumvent process 
to add the entire title to the bill, they 
didn’t carry over any of the good gov-
ernment amendments made in com-
mittee. 
Under the current text, the State and 
Tribal portions of the bill would be 
subject to strict administrative caps, 
but the Federal Government would not 
be. This is backwards, as the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service needs much more 
oversight since the agency is part of 
the reason we find ourselves in the po-
sition we are currently in with respect 
to the broken Endangered Species Act. 
Additionally, the programs funded in 
title III already receive existing appro-
priations, and if the majority would 
like to increase them, they should do it 
through the appropriations process in-
stead of airdropping in another layer of 
statute and bureaucracy into the legis-
lation. 
For these reasons, title III should be 
struck from the bill. Unfortunately, 
the majority refused to allow a vote on 
my colleague from Utah’s amendment 
that would have done just that. 
The very least we can do is at least 
ensure that title III is subject to the 
same administrative requirements as 
the other titles. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I again encourage adoption of these 
amendments, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
encourage my colleagues to support 
the en bloc package as well as the bill 
upon final passage, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). Pursuant to House Reso-
lution Number 1170, the previous ques-
tion is ordered on the amendments en

Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
The question is on the amendments

AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. KILDEE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 4 
printed in part D of House Report 117– 
366. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 29, line 18, insert ‘‘and efforts to man-
age, control, and prevent invasive species, 
disease, and other risks to such species’’ 
after ‘‘efforts’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Mrs. DINGELL) for offering this very 
important piece of legislation and to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
MEIJER) for his support on the amend-
ment that I am offering and all of our 
dedication to the Great Lakes being 
quite evident by this work. 
Growing up in Michigan, my family 
would camp and fish every year in East 
Tawas, Michigan. We grew up on the 
Great Lakes. These are really fond 
memories I have from my childhood, 
and it is a particular honor as a result 
to represent 118 miles of Lake Huron 
shoreline in Congress. 
Over the past couple of centuries, 
nearly 200 non-native species have es-
tablished populations in the Great 
Lakes. In my home State, invasive spe-
cies like Asian carp, zebra mussels, and 
phragmites threaten the health of our 
Great 
Lakes. 
Zebra 
mussels 
have 
clogged our water infrastructure cost-
ing millions in cleanup. Asian carp eat 
the wetland plants that are critical 
habitats for native fish and waterfowl. 
We have to prevent the spread of 
invasive species in our Great Lakes, we 
have an obligation to do that. 
This bipartisan amendment would ex-
pand the ability of the Fish and Wild-
life Service Endangered Species Recov-
ery and Habitat Conservation Legacy 
Fund to manage and prevent invasive 
species. We believe this simple amend-
ment makes this very good bill strong-
er and will have a positive impact on 
the Great Lakes economy. 
When we protect our wildlife and nat-
ural resources, we strengthen our econ-
omy and we preserve our way of life. 
The Great Lakes are a source of drink-
ing water for millions, a critical wild-
life habitat, and help support 1 million 
jobs in boating, fishing, and tourism 
industries. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bipar-
tisan amendment to protect our Great 
Lakes and strengthen our natural re-
sources, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to this amendment, 
which adds more responsibilities to the 
already duplicative and expensive title 
III portion of this bill, which was never 
debated in the Committee on Natural 
Resources. 
I have no objection to efforts aimed 
at controlling invasive species, and 
these efforts are already being carried

out by many Federal agencies. For ex-
ample, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice, the agency funded by title III at 
the expense of State and Tribal fund-
ing, already administers invasive spe-
cies control programs, including the 
Coastal Program and the Partners for 
Fish and Wildlife Program, two pro-
grams that title III would duplicate. 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service, or APHIS, at USDA mon-
itors, responds to, and conducts control 
and eradication programs to address 
invasive species that pose a threat to 
U.S. agriculture. 
These and other similar programs are 
subject 
to 
Federal 
appropriations, 
which is what title III should be sub-
ject to as well—not permanent manda-
tory funding. If the majority would 
like to increase Federal funding for 
invasive species control, they should do 
it through the appropriations process 
instead of airdropping another layer of 
bureaucracy into this bill. 
For these reasons, we should be 
striking title III from the bill, at least 
until the committee of jurisdiction has 
a chance to consider and mark up its 
provisions. Unfortunately, the major-
ity refused to allow a vote on my col-
league from Utah, Mr. MOORE’s amend-
ment, which would have done just that. 
I oppose this amendment to allow the 
funding for title III to be used for even 
more duplicative Federal bureaucracy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s comments, 
and I agree that we ought to do every-
thing we can to address this issue of 
invasive species. I just happen to be-
lieve that this bill is a very appropriate 
approach to this. 
Coming from the Great Lakes, I will 
say we need every tool we can get our 
hands on to protect this incredible re-
source. I welcome the opportunity to 
include this language in this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
DINGELL), my colleague, friend, and the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and friend from 
Michigan for this amendment. 
This bipartisan amendment offered 
by the gentleman from Michigan and 
cosponsored by the Republican gen-
tleman from northern Michigan makes 
it clear—or western Michigan, not from 
where DAN and I are, but it is Michi-
gan—makes it clear that eligible fund-
ing for conservation activities under 
the Endangered Species Recovery and 
Habitat Conservation Legacy Fund in-
clude invasive species and disease man-
agement control and prevention ef-
forts. 
Invasive species and diseases pose se-
vere threats to our Nation’s wildlife 
population, especially for species that 
are already threatened or endangered. 
Few places in the United States are 
more familiar with invasive species 
than the Great Lakes region which has 
been battling sea lampreys, zebra and 
quagga mussels, and now Asian carp. 
Native fish species are smaller and less 
plentiful than they once were thanks 
to these invasive species. 
On the disease front, chronic waste 
and disease, a fatal disease for North 
America’s deer, elk, and moose have 
spread to 25 States posing significant 
risks to those populations. 
To properly recover native species, 
we must provide the resources and co-
ordinate efforts to eradicate or control 
invasive species, prevent new introduc-
tions, and better understand emerging 
diseases. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I have 
no more speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the de-
bate and the conversation, but for me 
and I think for Congresswoman DIN-
GELL, and certainly for Congressman 
MEIJER
and anybody else who has 
grown up knowing and loving the Great 
Lakes, this is an important economic 
resource. It is an important cultural 
resource. It is literally the definition 
of the lines of our State. 
Protecting the Great Lakes is an in-
credibly high priority for Democrats 
and Republicans, liberals and conserv-
atives, people all across the spectrum. 
And every opportunity we have to take 
even a small step to do more to protect 
this precious water resource we are 
going to take that opportunity. 
For that reason, I support the under-
lying legislation. I advocate on behalf 
of my amendment. I hope my col-
leagues will join me, Mr. MEIJER and 
Mrs. DINGELL in supporting it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
once again, we all have invasive species 
that we deal with. It is something we 
should be focusing on. We just don’t 
need another duplicative Federal pro-
gram to do that. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. 
BUTTERFIELD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in part D of House Report 117– 
366. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD: Madam Speak-
er, as the designee of Mrs. KIRK-
PATRICK, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 3, line 24, insert ‘‘nonprofit organiza-
tions,’’ after ‘‘territories,’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-

from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 
b 1630 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Mrs. DINGELL and the rank-
ing member for their courtesy, and I 
also thank the Natural Resources Com-
mittee for all the work they do. I am 
not on that committee, but I have 
great respect and admiration for the 
committee and its chairman. I thank 
you for letting me have 5 minutes to 
present this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment is 
rather simple. It is straightforward. 
The underlying bill establishes a new, 
competitive grant program to support 
innovative strategies to help species 
recovery. That is the underlying bill 
we have been debating all afternoon. 
However, as drafted, the bill limits 
those competitive grants to only State 
wildlife agencies. 
Specifically, my amendment expands 
the eligibility of the grant program to 
include nonprofit organizations like 
the North Carolina Wildlife Resources 
Commission, the North Carolina Wild-
life Federation, the Pamlico Albemarle 
Wildlife Conservationists, and so many 
more wonderful organizations in my 
State, and perhaps in your States all 
across the country. 
Many of these nonprofits have tre-
mendous expertise in helping species 
recover and they should be eligible to 
participate in this new program under 
this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
which will strengthen our species re-
covery efforts. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment would actually make 
the bill worse by authorizing nonprofit 
organizations to receive funding under 
title I. 
This amendment is in direct con-
travention to the original intent of 
this legislation, which is to empower 
States and Tribes in species conserva-
tion. 
The current bill directs funds pro-
vided under this program to State and 
Tribal fish and wildlife departments or

to regional associations of fish and 
wildlife departments. 
The amendment would allow activist 
environmental groups, many of whom 
are serial litigants against the kinds of 
projects this bill aims to support, to re-
ceive funding under title I, decreasing 
money available for State fish and 
game departments. 
Radical special interest groups have 
weaponized the Endangered Species 
Act by continuously suing the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service. This sue- 
and-settle process overwhelms regu-
latory agencies, resulting in settle-
ment agreements and consent decrees 
that require agencies to promulgate 
major regulations within an arbitrarily 
imposed timeline. 
These agreements are often nego-
tiated behind closed doors with little 
or no transparency or public input, al-
lowing radical special interest groups 
to promote their own Federal policy 
agendas, outside of the normal proc-
esses. 
To make matters worse, these groups 
are financially rewarded for suing the 
government, for suing the American 
taxpayer. According to the Govern-
ment Accountability Office, from 2000 
to 2010, ESA lawsuits cost taxpayers 
nearly $24 million in attorneys’ fees 
and associated costs. 
Private citizens with a net worth of 
$2 million and for-profit businesses 
with a net worth of $7 million cannot 
receive attorneys’ fees under the Equal 
Access to Justice Act. However, there 
is no such cap for nonprofit organiza-
tions, which allows these wealthy 
groups to rake in taxpayer money. 
According to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, from 2009 to 2017, there 
were 109 Endangered Species Act set-
tlements. The majority of these settle-
ments came from just three groups: the 
Center for Biological Diversity, De-
fenders of Wildlife, and the WildEarth 
Guardians. The Center for Biological 
Diversity was individually responsible 
for 41 of the 109 settlements. 
This is not surprising after the Cen-
ter for Biological Diversity’s director 
said, in 2009, that ‘‘When we stop the 
same timber sale three or four times 
running, the timber planners want to 
tear their hair out. They feel like their 
careers are being mocked and de-
stroyed—and they are. Psychological 
warfare is a very underappreciated as-
pect of environmental campaigning.’’ 
We are paying them to do that. 
Today we can see the legacy of this 
mentality and these lawsuits out West 
where we have had two of our worst 
fire years back-to-back, and this year 
is not looking any better. 
I cannot in good conscience support 
allowing these radical groups to re-
ceive funding under this bill, especially 
since it will pull money away from 
State fish and wildlife agencies and 
Tribes, as the bill was intended to fund. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
oppose 
this 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues 
to join me in opposition. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I listened very carefully to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas, and I respect 
his position, but I just want to remind 
my colleagues that in my State and 
most States these organizations that 
are not nonprofits who care about the 
environment and care about protecting 
endangered species—in most States and 
in all of your States—these are not 
radical groups. These are good grass-
roots nonprofit organizations who real-
ly care about the environment and 
want to do their part in protecting our 
economy and our environmental econ-
omy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to please vote for this amendment. I 
understand the gentleman’s concern, 
but I assure him that the nonprofits 
that I speak of are not radical groups, 
they are good environmental organiza-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield as much 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Arizona and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina adds non-
profit organizations to the list of enti-
ties that are eligible to compete for in-
novation grants funded by the Wildlife 
Conservation 
and 
Restoration 
Sub-
account. 
Ten percent of subaccount funds are 
used to fund innovation grants. These 
grants are meant to catalyze the inno-
vation of techniques, tools, and strate-
gies while fostering collaborative part-
nerships that accelerate, expand, or 
replicate effective and measurable re-
covery efforts for species of greatest 
conservation need and species listed 
under the Endangered Species Act. 
Including nonprofit organizations in 
this competitive grant process will fos-
ter collaboration and ensure that the 
best strategies and efforts are being 
funded. 
Madam Speaker, I am sure that none 
of the groups are the radical groups 
that you are referring to, but I don’t 
know. It is a competitive process that 
will be carefully managed. 
Madam Speaker, I support my col-
league’s amendment. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
there are some wonderful groups out 
there that do great work, but this bill 
is not about funding private groups or 
nonprofit groups. This bill is about 
funding State and Tribal entities. It is 
what it was originally about. It has 
changed, it is now funding the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service as well. I 
guess the majority is thinking, why 
not just throw in some of these envi-
ronmental groups. Who else will this 
bill be putting funding out to before it 
is said and done? 
There are groups that abuse the proc-
ess. They abuse it greatly. They abuse 
it at the expense of the American tax-
payer. They abuse it at the expense of 
the environment. They claim they are 
wanting to help the environment and 
they are destroying the environment. 
Madam Speaker, I am opposed to this 
amendment, and I hope my colleagues 
will join me in opposing it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, in closing, let me thank the gentle-
woman from Michigan for supporting 
this amendment. It is a very simple 
amendment. It is a very commonsense 
amendment. It will allow and authorize 
nonprofit organizations, as Mrs. DIN-
GELL said, to compete for funding. 
It will not be a guarantee of funding. 
It will be an opportunity to compete 
for funding. It is a worthwhile amend-
ment, and I ask my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yea.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8, 
the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 14, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Ms. Jana M. Lean, Chief, Elec-
tions Division, California Secretary of State, 
indicating that, according to the preliminary 
results for the Special General Election held 
June 7, 2022, the Honorable Connie Conway 
was elected for Representative to Congress 
for the Twenty-Second Congressional Dis-
trict, State of California. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk. 
CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE, 
Sacramento, CA, June 14, 2022. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC.

unprocessed ballots and together the coun-
ties of Fresno and Tulare have an estimated 
53,610 unprocessed ballots. The U.S. House of 
Representative 22nd District encompasses 
the counties of Fresno and Tulare. 
As of June 13, 2022, at 4:59 p.m. the unoffi-
cial results of the Special General Election 
held on Tuesday, June 7, 2022, for U.S. House 
of Representative 22nd District show that 
Connie Conway received 55,169 votes or 61.5%

fice. 
According to the unofficial results, it ap-
pears that Connie Conway has received the

To the best of the Secretary of State’s 
knowledge and belief at this time, there is no 
contest to this election. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by the registrar of voters for

JANA M. LEAN, 
CHIEF, ELECTIONS DIVISION, 
California Secretary of State.

SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
CONNIE 
CONWAY, 
OF 
CALI-
FORNIA, AS A MEMBER OF THE 
HOUSE 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the gen-
tlewoman from California, the Honor-
able CONNIE CONWAY, be permitted to 
take the oath of office today. 
Her certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest, and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
her election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentlewoman from 
California? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will the Representa-
tive-elect and the members of the Cali-
fornia delegation present themselves in 
the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise her 
right hand. 
Ms. CONWAY appeared at the bar of 
the House and took the oath of office, 
as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same; that you take 
this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 117th Con-
gress. 
f 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
CONNIE CONWAY TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LOFGREN) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of my California colleagues and 
the House of Representatives, I wel-
come Representative CONNIE
CONWAY 
to Congress. 
A lifelong San Joaquin Valley resi-
dent, 
Representative 
CONWAY
has 
served as a businesswoman, healthcare 
worker, 
Tulare 
County 
supervisor, 
president of the California State Asso-
ciation of Counties, and director of the 
National Association of Counties. 
From 2008 to 2014, she served in the 
California State Assembly. During her 
tenure she also served as the Assembly 
minority leader. 
In 2019, Representative CONWAY was 
appointed to the USDA Farm Service 
Agency as the California executive di-
rector. 
In that role, she administered more 
than $100 million in safety net and dis-
aster relief programs serving California 
farmers, ranchers, foresters, and agri-
cultural producers. 
Representative 
CONWAY
previously 
operated her own consulting business 
and comes with experience in the 
healthcare sector—previously working 
for the Women’s Health Department at 
Tulare District Hospital and coordi-
nating a wellness program for Visalia’s 
Kaweah Health Medical Center. 
We look forward to working with 
Representative CONWAY. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CALVERT). 
f 
b 1830 
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE 
CONNIE CONWAY 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CALVERT) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, it is 
my privilege and honor to welcome 
now-Representative CONNIE CONWAY as 
the newest Member of the U.S. House 
of Representatives. 
Congresswoman CONWAY is a proud, 
lifelong resident of California’s San 
Joaquin Valley. She has dedicated the 
better part of her life to public service 
as a county supervisor, a legislator in 
the California State Assembly, and as 
the California Executive Director of 
the USDA’s Farm Service Agency. The 
constituents in California’s 22nd Dis-
trict stand to benefit from Congress-
woman CONWAY’s vast experience and 
dedication. 
I congratulate the entire CONWAY 
family on this exciting occasion, in-
cluding CONNIE’s husband, Craig; her 
children; and, of course, we can’t leave 
out her black lab, Jake. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the dean 
of the California delegation, Ms. LOF-
GREN, to introduce our new colleague. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to now welcome our newest 
Representative to the podium. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to Rep-
resentative CONWAY. 
Ms. CONWAY. Actually, Jake wanted 
to come, so did my husband, and he 
wasn’t able to make it. 
I want to thank him; my sons, An-
thony and Tim; and my grandchildren, 
Caine and Autrey, for their constant, 
loving support. I hope to make them 
all proud. As an aside, my grandson, 
Caine, tomorrow will be 16. 
He told me: Nonnie, I can’t go watch 
because I have had an appointment at 
the DMV for 6 months. I am getting my 
license, and I am not giving it up. 
So all I have to say to that is: Watch 
out Tillamook, he is off the tractor and 
onto the roads. 
I stand before you today and vow to 
give everything I have to be the capa-
ble and zealous Representative that my 
constituents deserve. I often look to 
the words of Luke and paraphrase: To 
whom much is given, much is expected. 
I take these words to heart in the role 
that has been entrusted to me: to hon-
estly, loyally, and passionately rep-
resent my constituents in the United 
States House of Representatives. 
I accept this charge with deep humil-
ity. My constituents, the great people 
of California’s 22nd District, are facing 
water shortages, rising inflation, and 
many other trials not of their own 
making. Their pain is my pain. Their 
concerns are my concerns. I stand 
shoulder to shoulder with them. 
As a daughter of the Central Valley 
and a lifelong fighter for our values, it

is my duty to ensure that our voices 
are heard in Congress. As your Rep-
resentative, you have my commitment 
that my door will always be open to 
those seeking to make the Central Val-
ley a better place. I look forward to 
serving with you. 
Madam Speaker, I close my remarks 
with a local colloquial saying: Go Dogs, 
Win the Mountain West. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. In light of the ad-
ministration of the oath to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. CONWAY), 
the whole number of the House is now 
429. 
f 
AMERICAN SOLAR 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the Biden 
administration abandoning tariffs on 
imported solar companies is terrible. 
What is the administration’s strat-
egy to protect American companies 
and American workers who are going 
to be harmed? 
First Solar and Solar Toledo, Ohio, 
two companies whose products are 
unrivaled anywhere on Earth, are at 
risk with thousands of workers’ jobs on 
the line. 
These 
firms 
employ 
hardworking 
Ohioans earning living wages that sup-
port themselves and their families, and 
it is unacceptable to allow China to lay 
waste to American industries. China 
has violated the rules and tilted the 
playing field in its favor. Our workers 
are sick of it. 
I have introduced a bill to create an 
office of manufacturing within the 
White House to champion good jobs in 
the USA. This bipartisan bill would en-
sure there is an explicit, long-term 
plan to grow American manufacturing 
industries and unleash our full manu-
facturing potential. 
Domestic manufacturing is the back-
bone of our region’s middle class, and 
it is time the Federal Government rec-
ognizes it. 
Enough is enough. Let America’s 
workers succeed. 
f 
HONORING DR. JAMES EMMETT 
‘‘JIMMY’’ DUCEY, SR., D.V.M. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in memory of Dr. James 
Emmett ‘‘Jimmy’’ Ducey, Sr., a vet-
eran, a veterinarian, and an excep-
tional Georgian. 
Jimmy was born in Savannah in 1934, 
the youngest of four children, and 
spent his entire youth in the State of 
Georgia. He then went on to graduate 
from Savannah High School and at-
tended the University of Georgia where 
he earned his doctorate in veterinarian 
medicine. 
In 1959 Jimmy and his wife moved to 
Fort Hood, Texas, where Jimmy served 
in the U.S. Army as a veterinarian. In 
1960, Jimmy returned to Savannah and 
took over his father’s veterinarian 
practice where he continued to serve 
his community for 60 years. 
Jimmy eventually retired from the 
Army, achieving the rank of major. 
Jimmy founded and coached the Wil-
mington Island Cardinals baseball, soc-
cer, and football teams, winning mul-
tiple city championships in soccer. 
Thankfully, Jimmy was able to see 
the University of Georgia win their 
third national championship before his 
passing. 
A loving father and husband, a vet-
erinarian, a veteran, and fellow Geor-
gia sports fan, Jimmy is sure to be 
missed. 
f 
BOOSTING SCIENCE-BASED 
CONSERVATION EFFORTS 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, our Na-
tion’s populations of fish and wildlife 
are dwindling. To save threatened and 
endangered species, we need the bipar-
tisan Recovering America’s Wildlife 
Act which will boost science-based con-
servation efforts. 
The United Nations has warned the 
world that human actions will con-
tinue to drive plant and animal species 
to extinction if we do not act. In my 
home State of California, native spe-
cies have declined by 20 percent, and 
over 600 species risk extinction. 
As a member of the House of Rep-
resentatives Natural Resources Com-
mittee, I have learned from scientists 
and advocacy groups that we need dedi-
cated funding to recover and sustain 
healthy populations of threatened and 
endangered species. 
Importantly, protecting these species 
is good for our economy. Wildlife-fo-
cused recreation generates $140 billion 
annually. The Recovering America’s 
Wildlife Act will sustain biodiversity, 
create jobs, and protect our planet. 
f 
FLAG DAY AND THE U.S. ARMY’S 
247TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today is Flag Day and the 
U.S. Army’s 247th birthday. 
Every year on June 14 we celebrate 
our Stars and Stripes. We celebrate on 
June 14 because on this day in 1777 the 
Continental Congress approved the de-
sign for our first flag. 
Over the years our flag has been 
changed to reflect the growth of our 
Nation, but one thing remains the 
same: It will always stand for freedom. 
Our flag is a glorious symbol of hope 
for our brave servicemen and -women 
who salute it, defend it, serve it, and, 
in some cases, die to protect our free-
dom and liberty. 
Today is also the U.S. Army’s birth-
day. For the last 247 years, our service-
members have been defending freedom 
at home and abroad. 
Today, our Nation celebrates our 
Army and our flag, which symbolize 
both America being the land of the free 
and the home of the brave. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
SYLVIA 
SASS, 
THE 
FIRST 
LADY OF SISTER CITIES INTER-
NATIONAL 
(Ms. STRICKLAND asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and service 
of Sylvia Sass, an extraordinary public 
servant and community leader in the 
State of Washington. 
Sylvia was a vital player in the early 
development of the Sister Cities Inter-
national organization. She was even 
appointed Washington State coordi-
nator due to her work in helping Presi-
dent Dwight Eisenhower rebuild inter-
national ties, and she was selected as a 
delegate to have lunch with him. 
In 2017, Sylvia received the Sister 
Cities International Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award, and to this day she re-
mains an active and honorary board 
member of the organization. Sylvia 
Sass is known as the first lady of Sis-
ter Cities International. 
Mr. Speaker, Sylvia exemplifies hard 
work, perseverance, and selfless service 
to others. I am proud to call her my 
friend, and I offer these remarks in her 
honor. 
f 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
SECURITY 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, the United 
States is a nation of laws, not mob 
rule. Whoever leaked a draft opinion of 
Dobbs v. Jackson broke the law and did 
great damage to the integrity of our 
judicial institutions. 
In the 5 weeks following the leak, 
protesters have taken to the streets of 
Justices’ homes to intimidate and har-
ass them for fulfilling their constitu-
tional duty to interpret the law, and 
even one deranged individual plotted to 
assassinate Justice Kavanaugh. 
Because of this, I am dumbfounded 
by the Speaker’s refusal on three sepa-
rate occasions to allow a vote to pro-
vide protections for the Justices and 
their families. 
Finally, more than 1 month after the 
Senate passed the bill by unanimous 
consent, we were able to hold a vote 
today. It took way too long, but, 
thankfully, it wasn’t too late.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5534 
June 14, 2022 
OUR SLUMBERING PRESS CORPS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
talk of everyone back home is over in-
flation. I want to give the press corps 
something to do. We are told the cur-
rent inflation rate is 8.2 percent, the 
highest it has been in 40 years. I be-
lieve the number is higher than that. 
They claim that the cost of rent or 
the cost to buy a house has gone up 5.2 
percent. I have talked to builders in 
which the cost of identical homes has 
gone up 30 percent. 
Interest rates have gone up from 2.5 
to 4.5 percent. I know somebody who is 
looking to perhaps flip a house that 
has gone up 20 percent. 
I would like the press corps in this 
country to look for examples of hous-
ing that has only gone up 5.2 percent. 
The other thing I would like them to 
look up is used cars have gone up 16 
percent. I have talked to car dealers, 
and they tell me the price of used cars 
has gone up 25 to 35 percent. 
So I beg the somewhat slumbering 
press corps to look into this and see 
whether our leg is being pulled by the 
claim that the CPI is only up 8.2 per-
cent.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
JONES). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 4, 2021, the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we 
are going to try to do a continuation 
on a theme. Last week, I came to the 
floor and sort of walked through what 
inflation was doing to seniors. Today, I 
am going to try to walk through what 
it is doing to the poor, the working 
poor, the middle class, all of society. 
One of the difficult things I am going 
to do, and I know it is somewhat rhe-
torical, is ask my brothers and sisters 
on the left: Are you happy with what 
you have accomplished? 
Democrats took, functionally, power 
here 15 months ago. They had the 
House, the Senate, and they took the 
White House. And we got to see the 
playbook. 
This is important because we often 
are so busy chasing shiny objects here, 
we never sort of talk about some of the 
economic differences and the way the 
left and those of us on the right view 
the world. 
The left sort of believes in this model 
of consumption. Send people checks, 
and they will go buy stuff and, some-
how, that will make society utopian. 
Of course, it also sets off really bad so-
cietal problems like: ‘‘Hey, I have 
money. I don’t have to participate in 
society and the economy.’’ ‘‘Hey, I 
have money. Let’s just go buy stuff 
today,’’ and it sets off inflation. 
Those of us who actually showed up 
to our economics classes, we believe in 
this concept—it is often referred to as 
supply side. It is much more com-
plicated. That is productivity in a soci-
ety, when you are going to pay some-
one more money, when a worker is paid 
more money, it is, functionally, from 
two things: inflation, which doesn’t 
mean they got anywhere. As a matter 
of fact, when you raise someone’s sal-
ary because of inflation, they are often 
always behind the curve. 
The second part is productivity. 
There was investment in plants and 
equipment to be more productive, to 
have that newest, best, functional 
product. That is a supply-side model. 
That is, functionally, what we accom-
plished in tax reform. 
The other challenge I will give to our 
friends on the Democrat side is, take a 
look at our couple of years when we did 
regulatory reform, when we did tax re-
form, 2018, 2019. The middle class got 
much wealthier. Income inequality 
shrank. Food insecurity shrank. Minor-
ity populations had their best eco-
nomic period in the modern economic 
time. 
I would visit the homeless shelter in 
downtown Phoenix, and St. Joseph the 
Worker had a list of businesses that 
were desperate for anyone who would 
just show up. 
Now, the contrast: The Democrats 
took over, and, functionally, 15 months 
ago, they moved $1.9 trillion of spend-
ing. I have been to the floor multiple 
times. I have shown you all the charts 
saying, isn’t it fascinating that almost 
on the day you did this, you can actu-
ally 
see 
actual, 
functional, 
price 
changes in the wholesale markets? You 
can actually see the curve going: Hey, 
they passed a bill; there is inflation. 
Now, some of that is not completely 
fair because some of it was actually al-
ready built into the policy sets the 
Democrats had adopted. 
When they blew up the capital stack, 
meaning when the Biden administra-
tion took over, and they had a compli-
ant Democrat Congress and a Demo-
crat Senate and, particularly, the left 
controlling the House of Representa-
tives, when they threatened capital 
markets for investing in hydrocarbons, 
when they threatened capital markets 
for investing in the transportation of 
hydrocarbons, moving natural gas—oh, 
you are going to build a pipeline. We 
are going to do everything so that you 
have to report to the SEC. We are 
going to basically make it so the com-
panies, the investors in this, have to do 
documentation of their environmental 
scores. 
You wonder why September a year 
ago you actually looked at the futures 
markets and saw it was already begin-
ning—natural gas, crude prices. So, the 
horrible prices you are paying today at 
the pump, it is not because of the Rus-
sian invasion of Ukraine. That just 
moved it forward. This was already 
built into the Democrats’ policy set. 
Let’s actually focus on something 
that is the derivative, that is the next 
level over from last week’s. Last week, 
we focused substantially on what the 
left’s policies were going to do to sen-
iors, how many of them will be in pov-
erty a decade from now because of in-
flation today. 
But 
let’s 
actually 
sort 
of 
talk 
through inflation through the economy 
because my fear is we do the headline 
discussion. Hey, did you see the num-
ber last week? It was 8.6. My commu-
nity, it is 11 something. I happen to 
live in number one or number two, the 
Scottsdale-Phoenix area, inflation in 
the Nation. 
But what does it actually mean? It is 
much more than the little number you 
saw saying, ‘‘Hey, last month it was 
this.’’ It is: What did it do to your re-
tirement a decade from now? What did 
it do to your kids’ and your grandkids’ 
ability to ever purchase a house, to 
ever build up savings, when every sin-
gle day their savings become worth 
less? 
There is a reason inflation is the bo-
geyman. It is because it functionally is 
government. You have a government 
with debt the size of our economy, and 
we are out there taxing all of you. 
Whether you understand it or not, that 
is the scam of inflation. This is what 
the Democrats have set up. 
Every single day, your savings be-
comes less, but also, the value of that 
massive debt the United States has be-
comes less because we are transferring 
your wealth. We are, functionally, de-
valuing your savings and then devalu-
ing our debt because it is being paid for 
by inflated dollars. 
I don’t believe it is purposeful, but 
now that they have set it off, I promise 
you, there are economists in this gov-
ernment who basically look the other 
way and say let it run this way for a 
couple of years. 
Think about it. The actual value of 
the debt, in constant dollars, stays the 
same, but—well, excuse me. It de-
creases because the dollar value has 
changed dramatically. 
It is cruel. It is crushing. And the 
economic violence that the Democrats’ 
failure to understand basic economics 
has done to the poor, the working poor, 
the middle class—please, just stop 
hurting people. It is math. 
Let’s take a look at this. We all got 
the May number, and we saw the price 
increases, the PCE. But when you 
started to look at the Consumer Price 
Index, 8.6—now, do you happen to re-
member before May, April, March, ‘‘Oh, 
we have hit peak inflation.’’ That is ab-
solute crap. 
Structurally, how many of you have 
actually looked at the gas pump this 
month? Have you seen where gas prices 
are? Put that as a factor in the infla-
tion and tell me that prices are going 
down, that prices have stabilized. 
There is an argument out there that 
we have hit a plateau. It just happens 
to be an outrageously high plateau. I 
don’t see it yet. 
We are in, functionally, what you 
call a wage-price spiral right now. I

June 14, 2022 
was made fun of about 3, 4 months ago 
when I came here and said that I think 
we are on the cusp of a wage-price spi-
ral. Well, guess what? I was right. 
What is a wage-price spiral? A busi-
ness raises its prices. Well, for my 
workers to be able to afford things, we 
need to raise their wages. But if we 
raise their wages, well, we have to 
raise our prices. Well, if we raise our 
prices, you raise your wages. It is the 
puppy chasing its tail. 
Right now, the only solution the left 
is offering, the only solution the Biden 
administration is offering, is to let the 
Federal Reserve break people’s backs. 
Raise interest rates enough. Pull li-
quidity out of the market. Break their 
backs. Put people in the unemploy-
ment lines. That will slow it down. 
The cruelty of what has gone on 
here—and there are other solutions. I 
have been here to the floor multiple 
times saying there are things we can 
do tax policy-wise, incentives to save, 
other things that would be great for re-
tirement security, great for growing 
the 
economy, 
and 
would 
help. 
It 
doesn’t solve the Federal Reserve’s 
problems, but it would help. 
The problem is, I would need my 
brothers and sisters on the Democrat 
side to basically open up an economics 
book and say: Yes, maybe making more 
stuff, maybe becoming more produc-
tive, would be good for society, and it 
would be good for pushing down infla-
tion. 
But God knows, the way the Demo-
crats run this place, I can’t even get an 
amendment in the Ways and Means 
Committee anymore, assuming they 
would actually hold a real hearing. 
This place is nothing but virtue sig-
naling anymore, but it is a virtue sig-
naling that—if they would actually 
talk about what they have done to peo-
ple. 
The hits keep coming. You start to 
look—and I know some of these charts 
are noisy. One of the tough things 
about talking about this right now is, 
these numbers have been moving so 
fast, trying to make sure you are using 
credible, third-party sources so you are 
just not making up numbers out of 
your own office and building a pretty 
chart, but you go out and find the ex-
perts. The experts can’t keep up with 
the movement of the prices, the eco-
nomic distortion that is going on. 
Part of my challenge is: Go look at 
your 401(k) right now. Are you happy? 
Now, you need to add in also that the 
fact of the matter is the money you 
have in there is substantially worth 
less than a year ago. So it is not that 
your savings, your investments, have 
crashed. Also, it is buying about 10 per-
cent less stuff anyway, so you needed 
to discount rate that. 
You understand that we have real 
negative interest rates right now. That 
is one of the reasons the Federal Re-
serve is probably going to have to jack 
up rates dramatically more than the 
talking heads are telling you on cable 
finance news. 
Think about it. If you are living in a 
country where the interest rate—let’s 
just use 10. It is an easy number. I 
know the number was 8.6. In my com-
munity, it is probably 11. 
Federal funds rates, let’s do a 10- 
year. Let’s use 31⁄2. Do you see that gap 
there? That is actually negative. You 
invest in a 10-year T bill, a 10-year U.S. 
sovereign instrument. You just lost all 
that. 
The model basically says the Federal 
Reserve is going to have to jack up in-
terest rates to close that gap. And be 
scared. Be scared. 
I have been here on the floor with 
charts before that basically said if the 
mean interest rate is 2 points higher on 
U.S. sovereign debt for, like, 25 years, 
at the end of that 25 years, every dime 
of tax receipts, every dime of tax rev-
enue, goes to just interest. 
Do you understand the scale of the 
dystopian misery that the Democrats’ 
economic policy has set off? 
Yes, it had great virtue signaling. We 
are going to give money to all these 
people. Great job. They are all poorer 
today than a year ago when you handed 
out $1.9 trillion. 
You start to look at who you are 
hurting. You start to look at folks in 
Social Security. Well, they are already 
upside down another percent. 
You 
start 
to 
look 
at 
major 
healthcare programs. Well, the infla-
tion there, packing into that. 
You start to take a look at other 
mandatory spending. Well, at least 
that has actually been deflated upside 
down because they don’t have the same 
COLA kickers. 
But you start to add up what is going 
on, major changes and projected out-
lays. The budget process here is going 
to be really interesting coming next 
year when we take the majority be-
cause the mess that has to be cleaned 
up economically is not going to happen 
in a year. 
For everyone who may be partici-
pating and crazy enough to listen to 
me, it is going to take years and years, 
maybe a decade, to just clean up this, 
functionally, 24-month cycle of what 
bad decisions did. For everyone listen-
ing, please, rethink your retirement. 
b 1900 
Please rethink your savings. Please 
rethink your investments. You are 
poorer today than you understand be-
cause it multiplies out into the future, 
and I am scared. 
I mean, we did one model in our of-
fice, and I have some boards here that 
are going to sort of touch on this, but 
let’s see if I can try to describe it. 
Let’s go back to my retiree. You are 
on Medicare, okay. So there is a hold 
harmless on the cost of Medicare, but 
not your co-pay. 
So if medical inflation is going up at 
almost double the inflation rate, so we 
had what, 8.6, but we have some charts 
that show medical inflation in the pre-
vious month may have been as high as 
16, 16.8. 
So if you have almost double, that 20 
percent of cash that comes out of your 
pocket also just doubled. So you are 
going to get an 8 percent COLA on your 
Social Security, okay, and your Medi-
care premium will adjust some, but 
your co-pay is skyrocketing. 
If you carry that out through the 
decade, the number of our brothers and 
sisters who will be in their retirement 
who will be in poverty—it is math. But, 
damn it, doesn’t this place care about 
people, or is it just too painful to step 
up and say we screwed up? Well, they 
screwed up. 
We are going to reach across the 
aisle. We are going to actually work 
with people who actually showed up to 
their economics classes. There are 
some ideas that would be good—and 
they should be bipartisan—that actu-
ally would help productivity, help peo-
ple save for retirement, and would be 
great for bending the inflation curve. 
Do you think any of us could get an 
amendment, actually even listened to? 
Because they don’t care. It doesn’t fit. 
Remember, we do public policy now by 
virtue signaling. The incredible dif-
ference—I am realizing the difference 
between my brothers and sisters on the 
left and those of us on the right is my 
constituents judge us on what did our 
policies accomplish? 
I swear to you. The media and the 
left judge their folks on what was their 
intention? What were their feelings? 
Because if they were judged on what 
they have accomplished, they have ac-
complished misery. 
As 
of 
May 
2020, 
inflation 
is 
plateauing, really, rather than peak-
ing. Understand what these economists 
were basically saying is this isn’t tran-
sitory. We were promised that over and 
over and over from the Treasury Sec-
retary, from the President, from Demo-
cratic leadership, even my brothers and 
sisters on the Democrat side on Ways 
and Means. Oh, it is temporary. It is a 
supply chain spike. No, it isn’t. Such 
horrible policies. 
They built a structural inflation 
problem. Now you are in a wage price 
spiral, and many of the economists are 
now saying it is not a peak and a fall— 
it is a plateau. 
One of the things that scares the crap 
out of me—and I am sorry, but I don’t 
know a better way to try without 
crossing the line and cursing and get-
ting my words taken down—is you hit 
the inflationary cycle with stagflation, 
meaning you functionally have some 
economic growth. You have employ-
ment. The Federal Reserve is jacking 
up interest rates, so you are trying to 
push up some of the employment. You 
are going to see some unusual charts 
and data we have here. 
But the inflation is sticky, and you 
basically have a plateau of inflation, 
you have a plateau of misery, and you 
are not able to raise it and crash it. 
One of the reasons I come to you 
with that as a personal theory—and it 
drives some of my economists nuts on 
the Joint Economic Committee when I

June 14, 2022 
say this—is I think we have a much 
more difficult demographic problem. 
Inflation in the late 1970s, very, very 
early 1980s, you had this huge baby 
boom population that was available for 
labor, available with new technologies, 
investments to spike productivity. 
We have got a demographic problem. 
Functionally, in 7 years, 22 percent of 
America is 65 and older. We have got-
ten old. We have huge, massive social 
entitlement promises that we have a 
moral obligation to keep—the financ-
ing of Social Security, the financing of 
Medicare. 
Remember: Every new dime of debt 
over the next 30 years is just Social Se-
curity and Medicare. I know a lot of 
folks don’t like to hear that, but it is. 
It is our demographic. We got old. The 
rest of the budget is functionally in 
balance. 
Really hard to break a stagflation 
cycle without that available popu-
lation spike to have that productivity 
to start to say, hey, we are going to 
make more stuff. We are cracking in-
flation. 
When you start to see some of the 
smart economists saying hey, we have 
got a problem. We are plateauing. It is 
not a spike. This may be the mean for 
a while. What is amusing, in a very 
dark way, is I have used this chart 
once before, so it is the projection of 
where inflation was going to go. 
The number of talking heads who 
would repeat the White House’s line 
that oh, it is transitory, or it is just 
temporary, or it is Putin inflation. 
Come on. At some point, treat the 
American people like adults. 
They may not have spent their life 
bathing in the numbers. They don’t go 
home every night and read The Econo-
mist magazine and these things, trying 
to dig. That is our job. That is what we 
are paid to do. Other people need to 
take care of their families and have a 
life and try to survive these prices. 
But the trend line on inflation is 
heading toward almost a 10 percent 
plateau. God, I don’t think we are 
going to get there, I really don’t, but 
that is my charting. 
You know, this was our target. We 
are nowhere near our target. We blew 
through our target by 2.8 percent. I am 
trying to show the happy talk that was 
going on in the previous three or four 
months. Oh, inflation is transitory. 
They have been wrong. 
I am going to do something slightly 
jerky. I have been here on the floor, 
and I got it right because we actually 
looked at the real numbers. 
You know, when you looked at the 
April inflation and realize, well, damn 
it, April inflation, they were calcu-
lating—they had fuel prices, they had 
base energy going down .6, .4, based on 
the numbers. That isn’t what happened 
in May. 
I mean, all you had to do was break 
it apart and look at the numbers and 
own a calculator. But remember: We 
work in a math-free zone. You start to 
understand. 
I know I am a Republican. I come be-
hind the microphone, I sound like an 
accountant on steroids. That is not my 
point. These numbers are people. These 
numbers are hurting people. There are 
millions—matter of fact, almost all of 
America is poorer today than they 
were 15 months ago when the left took 
power. Judge us by that. It didn’t need 
to be this way. 
I mean, you know, what is it, Larry 
Summers—I mean, a leftist economist 
is begging the Democrats, saying, don’t 
do this. Don’t do it. Don’t do it. You 
are going to hurt people. Oh, no. I am 
a Member of Congress. I understand 
better than a guy with a Ph.D. from 
Harvard. 
Turns out the Ph.D. leftist from Har-
vard who was begging you not to do 
what you did; you went ahead and did 
it. Now you have a Republican quoting 
him on the floor. 
Only large businesses—now, this one 
is 
important—are 
adding 
sufficient 
numbers of workers. So you remember 
how President Biden, I think it was 
yesterday, got behind the microphone 
and said, but we have such great em-
ployment. 
The pessimism on small- and me-
dium-size businesses has skyrocketed, 
and that is actually where much of our 
job creation and disruption in the econ-
omy and new spikes of productivity 
come from. They are the risk takers 
who will try new methods and systems. 
So, right now, big business has still 
been doing the hiring. What happens is 
that function where the Federal Re-
serve goes about jacking up interest 
rates, they are going to crush mid-mar-
ket and small businesses. I hope it 
doesn’t come, but every number I look 
at says it is going to come: the reces-
sion the Democrats have brought us. 
Is it going to continue the movement 
of the United States being a country of 
oligopolies, because we are going to 
wipe out a bunch of our small busi-
nesses? Our regional, smaller, mid-size 
businesses get wiped out, but the big 
boys stay because they can afford the 
regulatory—they can actually partici-
pate in capital markets. 
Is that going to be the outcome once 
again, that this, once again, becomes 
more and more a monopolistic econ-
omy? You also know the problem with 
that is you don’t get a productive soci-
ety when you have massive players 
that control so much of the society, 
the economics. 
Some of these numbers—you have 
got to understand, this number was the 
worst reading in 49 years for the 
smaller- and mid-size businesses doing 
hiring. 
So you functionally have almost two 
economies running at the same time. 
But this economy here, the small and 
mid-size, are most of our employment. 
Be worried. These numbers are not 
warm and fuzzy. 
Now we start to go to some of the 
cruelty that the Democrats’ economics 
have done. You see that bottom line? 
Those are functionally real wages. So, 
hey, here are inflation wages. Hey, I 
got a raise. Look, wages are going up. 
Real purchasing power. I am poorer 
today than I was the day before. 
So when you hear leftists come be-
hind these microphones and talk about 
income equality, they did it. It is driv-
en by crap policy like this. This is 
what is going on right now. Real wages. 
People are getting poorer every single 
day. 
Yet, there are folks here who are 
willing to just completely mislead on 
facts. Oh, but wages are up. Yeah, they 
are up. But they are not up nearly at 
the pace of inflation. This is really 
dangerous. 
You have got to understand, if num-
bers like this continue, this is what 
tears apart societies. This is not a 
game. This is beyond me being a Re-
publican, and I am beating up on 
Democrats. 
Please. I know we are heading into 
election season. I know everything is 
about knifing each other, but this 
chart is actually—this line here is peo-
ple. These are people getting poorer 
every single day. 
We keep offering suggestions, and we 
can’t even get an amendment consid-
ered. I understand the partisan cruelty 
to our side. We are not in charge. You 
are in charge. But why the cruelty to 
your own constituents? 
Because this did not need to happen, 
and it doesn’t need to continue. There 
are solutions, but maybe those solu-
tions also require something very dif-
ficult. 
You know, if you are in a 12-step pro-
gram—and God knows I have had 
enough family in 12-step programs— 
what is the very first step? Admit you 
have a problem. Democrats, I challenge 
you. Take the first step. Admit you 
screwed up, you screwed the American 
people, and you are willing to make it 
right. You are willing to work with us 
who own calculators to make it right, 
to help our brothers and sisters not 
continue to be poorer every day. 
These numbers should start to scare 
you. There are a number of economists 
out there I believe who have gotten 
this wrong. They say, well, we handed 
out so much free money in 2021, every-
one had so much cash in their bank ac-
counts, they set off inflation because 
everyone went out and bought a new 
television. Fine. 
Okay. What happens by the end of 
2021? By the end. So several months 
ago, credit card debt was climbing and 
had climbed rather substantially. That 
basically lets you know the way people 
were maintaining their consumption, 
their lifestyle. 
It wasn’t that they were building it 
in their earning power. They chewed up 
their savings. They were using debt to 
maintain their lifestyle. This is dan-
gerous because at a certain point you 
hit that debt wall and you have how 
many of your brothers and sisters who, 
all of a sudden, now are in real finan-
cial stress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 14, 2022 
b 1915 
When you start to see 28 percent 
annualized increase in the fourth quar-
ter was the fastest on record, basically 
saying, hey, fourth quarter last year 
was the fastest on record of credit card 
accumulation of debt. 
So when the White House, when my 
Democratic colleagues say, well, things 
aren’t that bad. Yes, we have inflation, 
but look how good the economy is. You 
built an economy on fake money, and 
now people are borrowing it through 
their credit cards. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, 
there was a sizable but shrinking pool 
of excess liquidity. So what they are 
basically saying is, do you remember 
how a number of us were coming to the 
mike and said, hey, Democrats, your 
$1.9 trillion that you did, what was it, 
end of March 2021, you pumped all this 
liquidity into the marketplace, as you 
set off inflation. People shored up— 
they paid off some debt. They had lots 
of cash in their bank accounts, and it 
was substantially gone by the end of 
last year. 
So how have people been financing 
the consumption of these incredible 
price hikes over the last few months? 
We are hunting for the latest bor-
rowing data, but we are seeing some 
preliminary numbers. A lot of Ameri-
cans now are in substantially more 
debt, so they are poorer than when the 
Democrats handed out $1.9 trillion. 
So within a year, they set off infla-
tion, and they made people poor, and 
now they are upside-down in debt, and 
they have got to figure out a way to 
pay for it. It is like every economic 
nightmare. Everything you could do 
wrong has functionally been done in 
the 15 months of Democrat power. 
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, may I in-
quire how much time I have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 281⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Look, this is 
functionally the same chart as the last 
one, except the point I am making on 
this one is we functionally moved from 
1 trillion 726 billion up. Before that, we 
were at $1.3 trillion of household sav-
ings. The savings basically has col-
lapsed. 
Is anyone talking about this? Re-
member, that was supposed to be the 
big Democrat talking point is, yes, we 
gave away a lot of money, but, look, we 
shored up people’s bank accounts. It is 
gone. It is gone. And it wasn’t done 
through productivity. It wasn’t done 
through investments that lead us into 
a greater future. 
The left keeps on saying, well, you 
invest in green energy. Fine. But that 
is not what you did. You basically 
adopted almost every policy—you do 
realize in the 15 months the Democrats 
have been in charge, we are burning a 
hell of a lot more coal today. 
The 2021 number is 23 percent more 
coal was burnt to produce U.S. elec-
trical energy because they blew up the 
natural gas markets. They made the 
United States dirtier, according to the 
greenhouse gas calculations. So even 
on that they screwed it up. 
And then here is sort of the punch 
line of why I am here tonight. You see 
the chart, you see the red, the red line? 
Is that red or maroon? Let’s go with 
red. Do you see this chart right here? 
That is for folks under $40,000 a year. 
And red basically means severe hard-
ship. They are in economic stress. 
This number here has exploded under 
the 15 months of Democrat control. 
This is what functionally they have 
caused by inflation, by everything 
around them. They have taken almost 
modest quartile of incomes, and they 
are brutalizing the poor. They are just 
brutalizing the working poor. 
Now, those folks over $100,000, yeah, 
but most of it is no real hardship. 
Their income category, they are doing 
not fine, but better. But you get down 
to $40,000 and less. So if you ever let 
someone on the left tell you they are 
the ones who care about the poor and 
the working poor and the working mid-
dle class, they may care. They may 
care, but they brutalize them by their 
policies. 
Look, it is in the math. Once again, 
the math doesn’t lie. The math will set 
you free. But we seem to do policy by 
virtue signaling here, not by some of 
the most compassionate, which is do 
the right thing. 
You have a model. Take a look what 
we accomplished in 2018, 2019, first 
quarter of 2020. The number of our 
brothers and sisters that were less 
poor, it was one of the most amazing 
economic revivals in U.S. history. Yes, 
we had the pandemic. Yes, it was mis-
erable. 
But think about this. Almost every 
bit of those gains are gone, and not 
gone because of the pandemic. They are 
gone because of the last 15 months of 
horrible economic policy that set off 
inflation, has set off optionality, has 
flatlined productivity, and actually 
really screwed up the next decade of 
our economic future. 
These get a little more difficult to 
show, but basically you are trying to 
sort of demonstrate when we hit the 
Biden inauguration, so this is the mo-
ment where Democrats had absolute 
power here, and how quickly the finan-
cial cushion disappeared. Now, a lot of 
this disappeared because you have the 
occasion where we are going to hand 
you a bunch of cash, but we are also 
going to set off inflation. It turns out 
the inflation chews up the cash a lot 
faster than we are handing out free 
money. 
As of April 2022, the average retire-
ment benefits—now, this is going to 
make complete sense, and in the scale, 
the reality is much, much worse, but 
we are trying to do a calculation of if 
you are getting retirement benefits, 
how much are you losing? How much is 
it changing? Our first calculation was 
about $162. 
Now I need you to add a couple more 
months to that. What we are starting 
to try to model is every month people 
on a fixed income, how much poorer 
are they getting. And that is also ad-
justing, say, they have COLAs, so they 
are going up, but the actual purchasing 
power, even adjusted with the COLA, 
they are falling, they are getting poor-
er every day. 
Now we are finally starting to get 
some of the data. The problem is we 
are about 3 months behind on trying to 
do hard calculations. 
Now you start to look, and this one is 
really important. I don’t have a bril-
liant way to try to lay this out. When 
we look at different demographics and 
what they consume, a young family is 
going to have different consumption 
than a couple in their seventies. This 
one is going to be much more medical 
costs, and this one might be education 
and a new bicycle. So what happens 
when you start to realize that food en-
ergy, when you start to see it moving 
in the charts, but then you come down 
here and start to see medical services, 
where they are in the inflation graph, 
and then you try to adjust them to 
populations. Then you realize you are 
ending up with this crazy sort of bell 
curve of misery, where older Americans 
are getting crushed, and younger fami-
lies are getting crushed because they 
don’t have assets that are inflating. 
And this is what is going on. 
I don’t know why there is not a fire 
drill around here. I mean, what would 
it take for those of us as Republicans 
to basically turn to the Democrat ma-
jority and the White House and Speak-
er PELOSI and the left who is in charge 
here and say, we actually care about 
Americans. We are willing to work 
with you. Let’s actually do the fire 
drill. Let’s actually do the things that 
set off productivity. Let’s fix expensing 
on the Tax Code. Let’s do this, let’s do 
that. What can we do instead of just 
letting the Federal Reserve jack up in-
terest rates and put people out of 
work? And that way Democrats can 
blame the Federal Reserve and not 
their own policies because they need 
deniability. 
Our job is to make people’s lives 
freer, economically more stable, bet-
ter, but also someone like myself—and, 
yes, I have a 6-year-old daughter, and 
my wife and I are the same age. It is 
the greatest thing that ever happened. 
Yes, I am an old dad. Greatest thing 
that has ever happened. What is my 
moral obligation to her future? Seri-
ously. 
For every person who on occasion ac-
tually shows up and works here, what 
is your moral obligation? What is your 
moral obligation to your parents and 
your grandparents but also to these 
kids? We already have this demo-
graphic curve that is going to make 
fixing inflation much more difficult, 
and we are basically shifting. 
If you are functionally under 40 years 
old, and you are still voting for the 
left, please, please go to an economics 
class. Go buy a calculator. Understand 
the amount of misery that has been

shifted onto your future. My back-of- 
the-napkin math basically says for 
someone who basically is getting ready 
to graduate college today, when they 
hit their peak earning years, their tax 
rate will have to be double what to-
day’s is just to maintain today’s bene-
fits. Congratulations. 
Look, Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I 
still have a number of charts, but basi-
cally they are all saying the same 
thing. You get to when the Democrats 
took power, and just what they did in 
blowing up affordability in our commu-
nities, blowing up affordability, pro-
ductivity in the country, and it was 
Democrat policies because it is more 
than just what we voted on here. 
It was basically threatening inves-
tors. It was threatening: The SEC is 
going to come and start to look at your 
investments. It is threatening. They 
used the regulatory state, they used 
the up and down, even the virtue sig-
naling within businesses. I mean, how 
many businesses basically sold their 
souls so Democrats wouldn’t say mean 
things about them? 
You start to look at family economic 
insecurity, and it just has exploded 
again since the Democrats took power. 
Mr. Speaker, and to whoever is inter-
ested, I am blessed to be the senior Re-
publican for the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, so I have access to some very 
smart people, and we are just doing our 
best to try to understand the numbers 
but also what we can do with the num-
bers. 
Last week I became the senior Re-
publican for Social Security, and, you 
know, you are reading the actuary re-
port, and then you are teaming it up 
with the actuary report for Medicare, 
and you start to realize the scale. The 
numbers here are stunning. The num-
bers of zeros. 
And we will get the clown show 
around this place that says, well, if you 
fix waste and fraud; well, if you get rid 
of foreign aid; hey, if you just tax rich 
people some more, everything will be 
fine. None of those things are close to 
being true. 
The scale of the problem that was al-
ready built into just our demographics 
and our promises, remember, the short-
fall for Social Security and Medicare 
when you pile on our current debt is 
$120 trillion, and that functionally hits 
in 29 years, and that is adjusted to to-
day’s dollars. Add in inflation, and the 
distortion. 
So my last comment I really want to 
try to share is one of our projects we 
are working very hard in our office is if 
the Democrats’ inflation continues for 
24 months, how much of our society 
will be in poverty? How many seniors, 
how many younger people because of 
the distortion? They functionally have 
wiped out all the amazing economic 
progress we made in 2018 and 2019 and 
the first quarter of 2020. 
Congratulations, you hated the last 
President, you hated the Republicans 
and what we did for the economy. Fine, 
you got rid of it. You wiped it all out. 
b 1930 
But understand, in just 15 months, we 
have whole regions, whole populations, 
whole segments of our society that are 
several percent—sorry to put it in a 
percent—poorer today. It just doesn’t 
go away, and you can’t just do another 
transfer payment to make it up. 
Turns out who you vote for does 
make a difference. Now, America gets 
to pay a price for what they did in the 
last couple of elections. But they were 
lied to. They basically thought virtue 
signaling was policy, and it wasn’t. It 
was about winning elections. 
At some point, Mr. Speaker pro tem-
pore, the calculator tells the truth. Mr. 
Speaker pro tempore, at some point, 
we should be judged by our accomplish-
ments for the American people. If that 
accomplishment is misery, be held to 
it. If it is prosperity, take joy in it. But 
we need to step up and demonstrate 
that we actually understand what is 
going on in our communities and that 
we are willing to step up and try to fix 
it instead of talk away from it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO KEEP 
AND BEAR ARMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Montana 
(Mr. 
ROSENDALE) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, for 
tonight’s Special Order, the House 
Freedom Caucus would like to discuss 
our constitutional right to keep and 
bear arms. 
I think it is really important that we 
make exceedingly clear that every one 
of the Members who is going to be here 
speaking this evening is as upset and 
disturbed by the tragic events in 
Uvalde as everyone else. 
But what we will not do is allow the 
folks on the left side of the aisle to use 
that as a tool instead of addressing our 
school safety issues, instead of using it 
as a tool to address the mental health 
issues that are rampant across our Na-
tion, instead to use it as a tool to di-
minish the constitutional rights of 
law-abiding citizens across our coun-
try, not only reducing the rights but, 
additionally, putting them in jeopardy 
as well, at the same time that they 
continue to try to undermine law en-
forcement and compromise the law en-
forcement community to protect these 
very same individuals so that they are 
forced to go out and make sure that 
they can defend themselves and their 
families and their property. 
This is a problem that we see taking 
place time and time again across our 
Nation. This isn’t just happening in Se-
attle, in Portland, and in Minneapolis- 
St. Paul. Unfortunately, we are seeing 
some of these exact same leftist radi-
cals who try to strip the power of law 
enforcement from cities even in the 
State of Montana. 
No one would ever believe it, but we 
had ordinances that were proposed in 
Helena, Montana, in Bozeman, Mon-
tana, and in Missoula, Montana, to try 
to defund our law enforcement at the 
same time we see crime levels rising 
everywhere. They are violent crimes. I 
have talked to the attorney general, 
and he has verified that very informa-
tion. 
The Members who are going to be 
here tonight are going to talk about 
the Second Amendment, and they are 
going to talk about it in great detail 
because they understand, as the mil-
lion Montanans do, that the Second 
Amendment is about much more than 
just hunting. As a matter of fact, yes, 
there are people who enjoy hunting 
with firearms, and they also enjoy just 
target shooting with firearms. They 
also have weapons that are antiques or 
family heirlooms that have been in 
their homes and families since the 
1800s. The most important thing that 
the Second Amendment is about is 
home security, defending your home 
and your household, and that is what 
we are going to hear a lot about to-
night. 
I am proud to say that Montana 
ranks as the number one State with 
the most guns per household. That, my 
friends, is how we can keep those crime 
levels down. Sixty-four percent of Mon-
tanans’ homes have a gun within them. 
Guess what? Criminals know that. 
When you put a sign out that says we 
defend our homes, people tend to stay 
away from those areas. 
We have a lot of information to go 
over this evening, and I have several of 
my colleagues who are going to be here 
to help me. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), my dear 
friend. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Montana for yielding 
to me. 
It is important for us to be here to-
night. It is important for us to address 
the attack on the Second Amendment. 
The reason I say that is that some 
people don’t care about that Second 
Amendment. Some people would pack 
the Court to do away with that Second 
Amendment. That is an important 
right. It is so important that, in the 
Heller decision, Justice Scalia said: 
‘‘The very text of the Second Amend-
ment implicitly recognizes the preexis-
tence of the right and declares only 
that it ‘shall not be infringed.’ ’’ 
What does it mean when you say that 
right is preexisting? It means that it is 
not given by the government, and thus 
it cannot be taken away by the govern-
ment. Instead, it is inherent in every 
individual, every person. 
In fact, the reason I use the word ‘‘in-
dividual’’ is because Justice Scalia 
made very clear, after a very lengthy 
discussion regarding militia versus in-
dividuals, that this is an individual 
right. It isn’t some kind of collective. 
It isn’t some kind of government-orga-
nized right. It is a God-given right, and

June 14, 2022 
thus it is prohibited for government to 
infringe upon that right. 
Justice Scalia went on to say exactly 
what I just said. He said: ‘‘This is not 
a right granted by the Constitution. 
Neither is it in any manner dependent 
upon that instrument for its existence. 
The Second Amendment declares that 
it shall not be infringed.’’ 
Anyone who has taken an oath of of-
fice to honor and defend the Constitu-
tion against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic, how can they then vote for 
legislation that would surrender that 
right to the government? 
My friends across the aisle have 
failed to remember how important it 
is. I am going to make three quick 
points. 
Number one: Why is an AR–15 impor-
tant? It is a gun that is light and easy 
to handle for people who are being at-
tacked. It is a perfect defensive weap-
on. It is important that we remember 
that. 
Second thing: Good guys with guns 
actually do save lives. Democrats ig-
nored the recent incident in West Vir-
ginia where a woman used her 9-milli-
meter pistol to stop a shooter who was 
shooting toward a crowd of people, 
with an AR–15, by the way. They ig-
nored the actions of Stephen Willeford, 
who stopped a shooting in Sutherland 
Springs, Texas. 
If you are relying solely on the police 
to come—I love my friends of the blue. 
We rely on them. We depend upon 
them. But when someone is attacking 
you, you don’t always have time to 
wait for those first responders to get 
there. 
My last point is this: If you are 18, 19, 
or 20 years old, you still have that God- 
given right to defend yourself and to 
the Second Amendment. 
The proposals of this body ignore the 
fact that the Ninth Circuit recently 
recognized and realized that they have 
those rights, and they struck down a 
California law that imposed a restric-
tion on 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds. 
Ladies and gentlemen, those who are 
listening, don’t give up your right. If 
you are a Member of Congress, don’t 
take away this important God-given 
right. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ROSENDALE 
for letting me speak. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
very 
much 
Representative 
BIGGS, one of our strongest defenders of 
the Second Amendment here in the 
body. 
If the left wants to address this issue, 
let’s be up-front about it. Let’s be hon-
est about it. Let’s stop trying to under-
mine the Second Amendment through 
changes in statute. Let’s stop trying to 
strip away people’s rights by inserting 
something into a law that later would 
be struck down by the Supreme Court. 
If you want to be honest and up-front 
about stripping away people’s rights, 
then come to this floor, propose an 
amendment to the Constitution, debate 
it here on the floor, send it to the 
United States Senate, see if you can 
get that done. Then send it back to the 
people of the United States and see 
how they feel about it. 
That is how this is supposed to take 
place. You cannot violate the Constitu-
tion and strip away people’s rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT), 
my good friend. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. ROSENDALE for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I love what Mr. BIGGS 
was saying, how these are our God- 
given rights. That right there is funda-
mental, and that is why we have a gov-
ernment, 
to 
secure 
our 
God-given 
rights. 
None of our rights come from politi-
cians. Our rights are not granted to us 
by the executive, by the legislative, or 
by the judicial branch. They are grant-
ed to us by God. These are our natural 
rights. They are unalienable. For any-
one to say: ‘‘I am from the Federal 
Government, and I am here to help,’’ 
well, those are very dangerous words. 
Another thing that is dangerous is 
gun-free zones. I am a cosponsor of 
Congressman MASSIE’s bill that would 
remove the law that makes our schools 
gun-free zones. That makes them soft 
targets. Our children are our Nation’s 
most valuable assets. The more value 
an asset has, the more protection it 
should have. 
We secure our banks. We secure our 
airports. We secure the White House. 
We have even seen the Capitol sur-
rounded by fences, miles of razor wire 
on top of that fence, 26,000 armed Na-
tional Guardsmen, because even my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
understand that borders that are se-
cure and armed security work. 
We need to harden our schools. We 
need to secure our schools. I believe 
this starts at a very local level. Maybe 
there is something there that can be 
boosted by the Federal Government, 
some of this unspent COVID money to 
go toward boosting security in our 
schools. 
We don’t need to be inching away the 
rights and liberties of American citi-
zens. Liberty lost never comes back. 
We don’t get that liberty back that we 
give away. We certainly were not elect-
ed to legislate away liberty from our 
constituents. We are here to keep the 
American people free. That is the prop-
er role of government. 
A lot of people would like to say that 
the Second Amendment, well, it is 
great because we know you want to 
hunt. The Second Amendment has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
hunting. 
Our 
Founding Fathers did not just return 
from a hunting expedition when they 
created the Bill of Rights, when they 
drafted that. No, they had just got 
done liberating a nation from a tyran-
nical, oppressive King, and they want-
ed a government that was so strong 
and powerful that it would be able to 
fight off that tyranny and oppression 
that anyone from around the world 
might seek to reimpose on this people. 
But they also wanted a government so 
limited that it would never impose 
that same tyranny and oppression on 
its own people. 
Isn’t it interesting that we heard for 
weeks how American taxpayers need to 
send money to Ukraine to make sure 
that those citizens are armed? 
b 1945 
Now the same people who are saying 
that we were bought by Putin because 
we didn’t want to send billions and bil-
lions of dollars to Ukraine while our 
southern border is unsecure, while we 
have an invasion taking place at our 
southern border, when we have our own 
supply chain crisis, we have inflation 
that is skyrocketing, and we said 
maybe let’s just put America first for a 
minute. But the same people who made 
these accusations against those of us 
who would vote against that spending 
are now seeking to take the rights 
away from American citizens. 
And these same people who had no 
problem arming Ukraine and wanting 
to disarm American citizens also call 
to defund the police. We even saw 24 of 
our colleagues from the other side of 
the aisle just today vote to not provide 
added security to our Supreme Court 
Justices who have had mob violence at 
their homes, murder attempts against 
a Supreme Court Justice. And 24 of 
these radical leftists said: No, they are 
fine. We are not going to send police to 
protect you. You won’t be able to pro-
tect yourself. It is all rogue. 
This is a lawless administration that 
we are serving under, and I would im-
plore the Senate to not compromise on 
the American citizens’ rights. 
And I would like to just note that the 
10 that we have heard of who are con-
sidering siding with these people who 
would limit the liberties and freedoms 
of American citizens are either not 
coming back to the Senate, they are 
retiring, or they are not up for reelec-
tion. I think that that is very telling, 
and I will not give an inch on the Sec-
ond Amendment, of the rights of the 
people to keep and bear arms to pro-
tect themselves, especially when cries 
from this Chamber are calling to 
defund law enforcement and our south-
ern border is wide open, allowing the 
cartel to send whatever they want 
through those borders without any 
added security. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ROSENDALE 
for leading this special order tonight, 
and I make reference that it is the 
House Freedom Caucus that is really 
setting the standard and protecting 
American liberties. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, we 
continue to hear the Democrats talk 
about the flawed arguments that we 
make that the Founding Fathers didn’t 
know weaponry would advance the way 
that it has, that the Founding Fathers 
could not conceive of a government 
that would never force us to do some-
thing against our will or deny us of due 
process. Please consider some of the 
activities that have taken place and 
the mandates that have been placed

upon us over the last 2 years, and don’t 
tell me that we have a government 
that has reached well beyond its 
boundaries. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON), who knows 
what it means to fight for our country. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
think there could be a more serious 
matter before this body. Everyone in 
the country, frankly, everyone in the 
world knows we can’t continue to see 
what is happening in our cities, in our 
schools, in vulnerable communities, we 
can’t continue to see those things hap-
pening. 
Sadly, 
Democrats 
have 
a 
pre-
conceived play for every tragedy. A fa-
mous Democrat even coined the phrase, 
never let an emergency go to waste, 
never let a crisis go to waste. 
It is a crisis for sure. But the crisis 
isn’t the fact that America has guns or 
that individual American citizens have 
guns. We have always had guns. 
What is different is the level of de-
spair in our communities. We see it 
surging not just in mass shootings but 
in the rise of violent crimes, in the 
surge in suicides, in fatal overdoses. 
The leading cause of death for 18- to 45- 
year-olds is now fatal drug overdoses. 
A lot of people will point to the mass 
shooters as they are ready to lose their 
lives. They have even coined a phrase, 
suicide by cop. They know how it is 
going to end when they go in doing it. 
So what is driving this? Is it the gun? 
It is an inanimate object. 
The solution, the Democrats say—it 
is a longstanding wish list. They have 
had a dream for a long time to repeal 
the Second Amendment. Frankly, they 
don’t want to campaign on that. 
Our colleague, Mr. MONDAIRE JONES 
from New York, when we were moving 
some of these bills through Judiciary 
Committee said, ‘‘You will not stop us 
from passing gun control. If the fili-
buster obstructs us, we will abolish it. 
If the Supreme Court objects, we will 
expand. We will not rest until we have 
taken weapons of war out of our com-
munities.’’ Frankly, Justin Trudeau 
agrees, but he is the Prime Minister of 
Canada. Canada doesn’t have a Second 
Amendment. 
Just today, I was walking through 
the Capitol from the Senate side to the 
House side, and a reporter stopped me, 
and she pointed out inaccurately that 
the Second Amendment grants us the 
right to keep and bear arms. 
No, ma’am, the Second Amendment 
does not grant us anything. In fact, the 
Bill of Rights grants us nothing. The 
Second Amendment is a limitation on 
the ability of government to infringe 
on our preexisting rights. Just as the 
Declaration recognized we were en-
dowed by our creator with certain in-
alienable rights that among them are 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
This is an extension of the right to 
life. And, hopefully, tomorrow we will 
see the Supreme Court defend life. You 
can’t defend freedom without defending 
life. In the modern era one of the key 
instruments to defending life for adults 
is the right to keep and bear arms. 
People have referred to some weap-
ons as weapons of war. No, they are not 
the same weapons as weapons of war. 
Those were outlawed in the 1930s under 
the National Firearms Act. They have 
been outlawed for a long time. A semi-
automatic rifle or a semiautomatic pis-
tol is not a weapon of war, though 
sometimes they are used in that mode 
in combat. They are very effective in 
war, but our Founding Fathers didn’t 
vest the defense of this Nation origi-
nally in a standing Army. In fact, they 
said we don’t want a standing Army. 
One of the limitations on this body is 
we have to fund the defense budget 
every cycle. We can’t have it operate in 
perpetuity without reauthorizing it 
every time. We had a standing Navy, 
but we didn’t have a standing Army. 
Let’s read the text of the Second 
Amendment. The Second Amendment 
says: ‘‘A well regulated militia, being 
necessary to the security of a free 
State, the right of the people to keep 
and bear arms, shall not be infringed.’’ 
Famous words. 
People want to pretend that some-
how the Second Amendment granted 
the State the ability to keep and bear 
arms. Only if you are in the military. 
Only if you are in the militia. That is 
the same right to keep and bear arms 
the North Korean Army has. What a 
fallacy. I can’t believe some of our 
countrymen fall for that, but some of 
them do. And that is why my col-
leagues repeat it. They know, though, 
but they say the lie anyway. 
Well, what are we going to do about 
it? Well, we are certainly not going to 
surrender our freedoms because we 
know freedom surrendered is rarely re-
claimed. We aim to keep our Second 
Amendment. 
Just as Ben Franklin—recognized 
walking out of the Constitutional Con-
vention—was asked: What have you 
wrought, sir? A Republic if you can 
keep it. The people, and we aim to keep 
it as the people’s Representatives. 
Who defends freedom in Congress? 
The Freedom Caucus. I am proud to be 
here with my colleagues taking this 
time tonight to defend this important 
freedom. 
But I think people are right to say, 
So what are we going to actually do 
about it? 
If you listen to the debate you might 
know that there are a lot of shooters 
that turn into active shooters, mass 
murderers, doers of evil deeds that peo-
ple will say after the fact, well, you 
know, everybody kind of knew Johnny 
or whoever was crazy. You know, we 
kind of saw this coming. Maybe we 
could have stopped him. If only there 
was a red flag law. 
So people in America might not real-
ize that in every single State and in 
the District of Columbia it is already 
possible to stop such a person. The law 
is known as the Baker Act. It is pos-
sible to have a person, even involun-
tarily, against their will, adjudicated 
mentally incompetent. That law pre-
serves due process. The person has a 
right to confront his or her accusers. 
That law locks up the right thing. You 
can’t deprive a person—under the Fifth 
Amendment and the 14th, you cannot 
deprive a person of life, liberty, or 
property without due process. 
Red flag laws reverse that. Not only 
do they get rid of the due process, it is 
essentially civil asset forfeiture. First, 
you seize the guns and you get to due 
process later. It seizes the wrong 
things. It locks up the guns. 
The person is the dangerous thing. So 
you take the guns away from the per-
son. The person, if they really are men-
tally dangerous, they can get access to 
guns in other ways, perhaps illegally, 
as a substantial portion of shooters do. 
Perhaps they could drive a car through 
a parade route. They could use a blade. 
They could use all kinds of ways to 
harm others, and frankly, they could 
also harm themselves, turning into one 
of the tragic suicides that occur every 
day in our country. 
So, no, I think the Baker Act ought 
to be the thing that people focus on. 
Those are overwhelmingly State laws. 
And we have to focus on understanding 
why those laws aren’t used. 
My colleagues know of these laws, 
particularly the ones on the Judiciary 
Committee, but they don’t bring them 
up. They pretend as if the only way to 
stop this is with the red flag laws. And 
you know, while I know the Democrats 
have had a longstanding desire to go 
after the Second Amendment, I will 
admit it is especially discouraging 
when Republicans break ranks on this 
core issue. 
I was disappointed to see 10 of our 
House colleagues vote for some meas-
ure of gun control in the House. Five of 
them aren’t running again, and five of 
them may find that they are not run-
ning again at some point. In the Senate 
there are already 10 that are openly 
supportive of this outline, framework 
of a deal. We haven’t seen text, but we 
do know it encourages red flag laws, 
which ought to be ruled unconstitu-
tional, as all civil asset forfeiture 
ought to be ruled unconstitutional. 
When you look at civil asset for-
feiture, it is disproportionately used in 
minority and disadvantaged commu-
nities. 
Why? How? Because they don’t have 
the money to get the assets back. The 
government seizes it. It spins due proc-
ess on its head, and you have to go to 
court to prove the property is yours or 
that you are able to own it safely. 
And when you talk about a gun, 
while guns aren’t always cheap, law-
yers are more expensive. So most peo-
ple will simply buy another gun, rather 
than go back and fight the unjust ac-
tion in courts. It is so ripe for abuse. It 
is horrible to see anyone who has sworn 
an oath to support and defend our Con-
stitution support such measures. I hope 
people will pull back and rethink it; 
not rethink solving the problem.

Let’s look at the Baker Act, and let’s 
look at mental health. Let’s look at 
these acts of despair that are wrecking 
our communities and individual lives, 
and let’s stop falling for the fallacies 
that somehow gun control is going to 
end the actions of these doers of evil 
deeds. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for hosting this special order. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to stand here with the members 
of the Freedom Caucus tonight because 
they are the ones that understand we 
are standing here with a simple task, 
and that is to defend the rights of the 
people across this Nation. That is what 
our job is. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE), my good 
friend. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Montana for 
your leadership on this issue and for all 
the members of the House Freedom 
Caucus who stand for the issues that 
are both constitutional and extremely 
important to the American citizens. 
All of us, all of us, all of us have been 
shocked over and over to see the un-
speakable acts of violence, mass shoot-
ings and the like that have taken place 
in recent years and are rising in inten-
sity and frequency. We see the heart- 
wrenching situations that these trage-
dies create in families and commu-
nities, and we see the rippling effect 
that they have in our Nation as a 
whole. 
But far too often when these types of 
things happen, the reaction has become 
predictable from our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, from the media, 
from others who immediately jump to 
conclusions, politicize the tragedies, 
and transfer to an agenda that includes 
disarming 
law-abiding 
citizens 
and 
stripping away our constitutionally 
protected Second Amendment. 
b 2000 
Stricter regulation is not the issue— 
it is not the answer. Stripping away 
constitutional rights of American citi-
zens is not the answer to these prob-
lems. 
When considering how to deal with 
issues like mass shootings, we need to 
dig down to the root cause. This is just 
common sense. We have a major prob-
lem, let’s get to the cause of the prob-
lem. 
Firearms are just a tool, and like 
with any tool, the tool is only as effec-
tive or ineffective as the one operating 
the tool. I am not a violent person, 
that is why I don’t have violent guns. 
The guns are not the problem. The per-
son is the problem. 
If you have a violent person—as has 
already been stated tonight—a violent 
person is going to commit violent acts. 
What is our response here—let’s not go 
after the person, let’s not deal with the 
cause, let’s go after the tool, the in-
strument that was used. That does not 
solve the problem. 
If we are ever going to deal with 
issues like mass shootings, and a host 
of other issues of that nature, then we 
have got to look at the problem, which 
is the shooter. We, in this country 
right now, we are a Nation in deep 
moral and spiritual crisis. 
Among other things, we are watching 
our values in the family unit deterio-
rate right under our nose. Just today 
in a hearing in the Oversight Com-
mittee where the Democrats were yet 
again offering one piece of legislation 
after another that continues to dete-
riorate and dismantle the most critical 
unit in this country—that is the family 
unit. 
Mr. Speaker, I would challenge any-
one to take a deeper look at those who 
have committed such violent, heinous 
crimes that we have watched and see 
what their family life was like, what 
their spiritual life was like, and we will 
start finding some of the issues here 
that must be addressed. 
Yet, we have so many attempts right 
now to address all the wrong things. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
f 
BIDEN’S ECONOMICS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss something that has 
been on my mind—discuss an issue that 
we have been talking about and we 
have been holding hearings in both the 
Budget Committee and the Ways and 
Means Committee, and that is the 
state of our economy, which I would 
characterize as the dire state of our 
economy, which I believe—I will dem-
onstrate 
with 
some 
charts 
this 
evening—is due to the reckless budg-
etary policies of this administration. 
What I am talking about is today we 
have inflation at 8.6 percent, which is 
the highest level in over 40 years. We 
also have a GDP, or gross domestic 
product, the total output of our econ-
omy that is shrinking in the first quar-
ter. It shrank 1.4 percent. We may well 
be on the way to a recession if the sec-
ond quarter shows that it is shrinking 
as well. 
So there is no better time than right 
now to renew our Nation’s commit-
ment to fiscal responsibility, and to 
make a difference in the lives of the 
people that we represent. 
Let’s talk a little bit about inflation. 
Food prices are up 10.1 percent. Real 
wages—that is the difference between 
inflation and the rise of wages—are 
down 3.4 percent as of today, meaning 
that the average family is facing an ef-
fective pay cut of $1,500 just this year. 
Everyone knows gas prices are at 
their highest ever with average prices 
in my hometown of Lancaster, Penn-
sylvania, now exceeding $5 a gallon. 
Overall energy costs, home fuel oil, and 
others included, is up 34.6 percent. 
Unfortunately, as I will point out to-
night, the spending policies enacted 
and pushed by the Biden administra-
tion and by Democrats in Congress are 
really responsible for driving inflation 
and are certainly—even if you don’t 
agree with that—they are certainly 
saddling future generations with debt. 
Someone will pay the price for the 
massive debt we have now, and unfor-
tunately, that will be our kids and 
grandkids and future generations. 
It has been said that Congress has a 
habit of only addressing problems when 
we reach a crisis—only addressing 
issues when we reach a crisis. That cri-
sis may have already begun right now. 
We are in a pretty tough spot in our 
economy at the moment and people are 
feeling it every single day. We must 
step up to begin to address this. 
Every Member of Congress, I am 
sure, has talked to their constituents 
and can share stories about how their 
constituents are impacted by rising 
prices. I can tell you myself, growing 
up as a child, I experienced what it was 
like to have it be difficult for my fam-
ily to afford food. 
I was one of 12 kids. My father was 
first a farmer and a roofer, my mom 
was a stay-at-home mom. I can tell you 
about a stressful time for my mother 
was going to the grocery store. The 
reason for that is because she knew she 
would not have quite enough money to 
buy everything that she thought she 
needed. 
I remember walking with her up and 
down the aisles and she was calculating 
in her head how much she was putting 
in the cart. She was very concerned 
that she would get to the register and 
be embarrassed that she would have to 
put some things back. Today, people 
are feeling that. 
I hear in my district, for instance, 
my constituent, Lamar, he put the im-
pact of inflation in clear terms. He 
tells me that he spends more now but 
has less. He is doing with less. Paul 
says he is sadly giving up on his hopes 
of retirement at this time. Tim said he 
has to choose between gas and gro-
ceries every week. Lavern is 66 years 
old and had to go back to work to help 
out his children and his grandchildren 
now, though the impact of inflation on 
future debt will mean, as I mentioned 
earlier, that his grandchildren will be 
paying the cost of the reckless spend-
ing that we are seeing now. They will 
be paying for that for decades. 
We have all heard from our constitu-
ents. We have heard their outcries. We 
have heard them talk to us about need-
ing to rein in inflation. I think it is 
time that we take it as a wakeup call. 
Let’s identify the causes of inflation 
and work to mitigate them. 
That is one of the reasons that I 
wanted to get up and speak tonight be-
cause we have had debates in both of 
the committees that I mentioned about 
the causes of inflation—and that is not 
just a political debate—it is not just 
because. It is because the only way 
that we can begin to solve it is to un-
derstand the root cause of inflation, 
what led to where we are now, and then 
what we can do to change it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5542 
June 14, 2022 
It is going to take leadership at all 
levels of government to address not 
only inflation, but the $30 trillion now 
in debt, and trillions of dollars in defi-
cits as far as we can see and as far as 
the Biden budget projects. 
I am a businessowner, not an econo-
mist, so I can’t even say that I have all 
the answers. What I can tell you is that 
I believe that capitalism, freedom, and 
free enterprise have made the United 
States the most powerful Nation in the 
history of the world and has provided 
more opportunity than ever before in 
the history of humankind. I think re-
turning to those core values can help 
lead us—will help lead us—out of this 
mess. 
First of all, there is a chart I will 
show you. Inflation does not arrive 
randomly. There are forces that cause 
inflation. Every time we have seen in-
flation in our history there are forces 
that cause it. 
In this case, we have had things that 
are outside of our control, Democrats 
will argue, and the President blames 
inflation on COVID–19, supply chain 
disruptions, 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, the big bad oil and gas compa-
nies, and other things. I don’t know 
what the next thing is that he will be 
blaming inflation on. I agree, they 
have certainly played a role in causing 
inflation. 
However, those challenges are the 
same challenges that every other coun-
try across the world has faced and they 
do not explain why inflation in the 
United States spiked earlier and is 
much worse than what we are seeing in 
other countries. 
This chart shows the annual core CPI 
inflation compared to OECD, which is 
sort of peer countries, the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation in Develop-
ment Countries. It shows how inflation 
spiked starting roughly the beginning 
of 2021 and far exceeded that of a com-
parable country. What caused that? 
I have another chart that puts a lit-
tle finer point on this. This shows that 
inflation started about the time that 
Biden took office and really acceler-
ated after the passing of the American 
Rescue Plan, which put trillions of dol-
lars in spending into our economy. 
Now, I showed that chart today in a 
hearing in the Budget Committee to 
Mr. Stephen Moore of the Save Amer-
ica Coalition, and he agreed that the 
clear difference between what we saw 
in the past chart, the blue line, and the 
other countries, the clear difference 
was the stimulus that was provided, 
the increase in demand that was pro-
vided by inserting trillions of dollars 
into the U.S. economy through the 
American Rescue Plan Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article I wrote, an op-ed that was 
published in The Hill on how President 
Biden’s policies have caused and will 
further fuel inflation. 
[From The Hill, Mar. 31, 2022] 
BIDEN’S SPENDING PLAN WILL FURTHER FUEL 
INFLATION 
(By Rep. Lloyd Smucker) 
Americans are concerned about the econ-
omy. A recent NBC poll indicated that only 
33 percent of Americans approve of President 
Joe Biden’s handling of the economy. Infla-
tion is now at a 40-year high and has families 
concerned about their financial well-being as 
they gather to review their budgets around 
the kitchen table. 
Democrats try to dismiss inflation as a 
mere nuisance for Americans who have to 
cut back on so-called ‘‘luxuries.’’ When my 
constituents point out that gas is too expen-
sive, Democrats shrug and tell them to buy 
a Tesla. The Penn Wharton Budget Model 
concluded that inflation disproportionately 
impacts lower income Americans who have 
to pay an even higher percentage of their in-
come on necessities like food and transpor-
tation. The latest consumer price index re-
port shows prices for food are up 7.9 percent, 
gasoline 
prices 
recently 
reached 
record 
highs. We need to help the Americans who 
can’t afford to put gas in their car, let alone 
buy an expensive new electric car. 
Inflation isn’t just an economic term; it 
has real world consequences for the constitu-
ents that I represent. In my district, I think 
of Connie who at 70 years old is looking for 
a part-time job to help make ends meet be-
cause of the higher cost of everyday neces-
sities. I think of Tim who told me he must 
decide between buying gas or groceries. I 
think of Lynne who told me that she and her 
husband are planning to put off retiring be-
cause of higher prices. 
These kinds of stories are commonplace as 
inflation strains family budgets across the 
nation. The Biden administration claimed 
inflation was ‘‘temporary’’ and now places 
blame on everything except his reckless 
spending. We know that the left’s irrespon-
sible spending has accelerated inflation past 
harmful levels. A study from the Federal Re-
serve Bank of San Francisco concludes that 
Biden’s spending led to higher levels of infla-
tion. 
As the saying goes, an organization’s budg-
et is a statement of its values. Now that 
President Biden released his Fiscal Year 2023 
budget, albeit seven weeks past the statu-
tory deadline, we can see clearly that this 
administration puts wasteful, inflationary 
spending before all else. While the president 
preaches fiscal restraint, this budget puts 
forth policies reaffirming the president’s 
tax-and-spend march towards socialism. 
Biden’s proposed budget would spend $5.8 
trillion next fiscal year. His proposal would 
continue to pile on to the national debt, 
which eclipsed $30 trillion earlier this year. 
By their own estimates, his spending plan 
will add nearly $15 trillion in new debt over 
the next decade, with annual budget deficits 
of at least $1 trillion per year. 
The Biden administration continues to live 
in an alternate reality when it comes to 
their inflation predictions. Their budget re-
port estimated the consumer price index 
(CPI) would increase 4.7 percent for 2022. The 
most recent reading from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics reports that CPI is up 7.9 
percent over the last year. In last year’s 
budget, they predicted only a 2.1 percent 
change in CPI for 2022, far off the mark from 
the high levels of inflation that we’re experi-
encing. 
Buried deep within the administration’s re-
marks in the ‘‘analytical perspectives’’ the 
Biden administration believes that inflation 
will return to its long-term trend in 2023 de-
spite ‘‘considerable uncertainty’’ and their 
efforts to continue the White House’s mes-
saging blaming Russia for increased infla-
tion. They have spent nearly a year deflect-
ing that their policies contribute to infla-
tion, but at least the administration is no 
longer parroting that inflation is temporary. 
From what we’ve read in Biden’s first two 
budget proposals, Americans should remain 
concerned about his dangerous levels of 
spending, what it means for the future finan-
cial health of our nation, and what it means 
for the future of inflation levels. Our $30 tril-
lion national debt significantly impacts the 
next generation of Americans. Continuing to 
run trillion-dollar deficits and adding more 
to our mountainous debt further endangers 
our future. 
While President Biden and congressional 
Democrats have tried to move on from their 
months-long public feud on spending, House 
Republicans are united in our fundamental 
principles of working to renew fiscal sanity 
in Washington through a limited govern-
ment, pro-growth tax policy, and strength-
ening our free enterprise system to create 
opportunities for Americans to live the 
American Dream. We will exercise robust 
oversight of President Biden’s spending spree 
to hold this administration accountable. We 
will continue to fight against wasteful 
spending ballooning our debt and deficit. 
House Republicans will work to put Amer-
ica’s fiscal house in order. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, March 
2021, the Biden administration and con-
gressional Democrats rammed through 
$1.9 trillion in deficit spending, and 
only a small portion of that really 
went to solving problems and helping 
people that needed help through the 
pandemic—that helped to defeat the 
pandemic. Much of this was not needed 
and only served to fuel inflation. 
By the way, they were warned by 
many economic experts. We warned 
them. Republicans on the Budget Com-
mittee and the Ways and Means Com-
mittee warned Democrats at the time 
this was passed in early 2021 that we 
would see exactly this result. We were 
relying on the forecasts of many econo-
mists who were saying exactly that, 
who were warning the administration 
of that at the time. Not just Repub-
lican economists, by the way. 
There is a name that many of you 
will know, he is a former Obama and 
Clinton economist, Treasury Secretary 
Larry 
Summers, 
warned 
that 
the 
American Rescue Plan would be the 
biggest macroeconomic mistake in 40 
years, and it would cause inflationary 
pressures of a kind that we have not 
seen in a generation. 
Again, Larry Summers, a very well- 
respected 
Democrat 
administration 
economist warning that we would be 
seeing the inflation that we are seeing 
now, over a year ago, when the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan was passed. 
Just recently a study by the San 
Francisco Federal Reserve confirms 
that prediction, attributing the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan for at least three 
points of the current 8.6 percent. Mark 
Goldwein of the Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, CRFB, de-
scribed the American Rescue Plan as 
‘‘pouring gasoline on the fire,’’ in 
terms of an already stimulated econ-
omy.

Committee hearing last month, he also 
agreed—head of CBO—that the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan Act pumped trillions 
of dollars into the economy that artifi-
cially fueled demand and ultimately 
drove today’s inflation crisis. 
b 2015 
So what happened? 
We had far too much cash in the 
economy and far too much demand. 
I will show you, Mr. Speaker, some-
thing that my Governor in Pennsyl-
vania said. Governor Wolf tweeted that 
he wanted to send more money to peo-
ple all across Pennsylvania after jobs 
were open and people were back to 
work because he said, ‘‘States are 
swimming with cash.’’ 
They have an unusual problem in 
Pennsylvania right now today. This is 
the week they are finishing the Penn-
sylvania budget, and they have more 
money than they know what to do 
with. Much of that came as a result of 
the American Rescue Plan, and it was 
excess money that wasn’t needed in the 
economy. 
So those funds would have been far 
better used paying down the deficit, 
paying down the debt, and not fueling 
inflation by artificially boosting de-
mand. So it really is unfortunate be-
cause this hurts my constituents, and 
it hurts people all across the country 
that the White House did not heed the 
call of experts sooner and did not take 
steps to reduce the impact of inflation. 
For a while the White House instead 
said that inflation would be transitory, 
and now just recently Secretary of the 
Treasury Yellen and Fed Chairman Je-
rome Powell backed off that argument 
and agreed that they were wrong, and 
that inflation was not transitory. We 
have a real problem dealing with infla-
tion at this point. 
Secretary Yellen said in a Ways and 
Means hearing just last week: ‘‘I think 
I was wrong then about the path that 
inflation could take.’’ 
One of the sad things about inflation 
is that it impacts different people dif-
ferently. The White House has claimed 
that inflation and the economy’s chal-
lenges that we are seeing today are 
high-class woes reserved for the rich. 
But instead, it is the people on the 
lower end of the economic scale who 
are making less money who are im-
pacted more than any others by infla-
tion. 
The Penn Wharton Budget Model 
concluded that inflation disproportion-
ately impacts lower-income Americans 
who have to pay an even higher per-
centage of their income on necessities 
like food and transportation, the price 
increases for which outpace the general 
inflation rate. 
As I mentioned earlier, the White 
House tries to blame multiple sources: 
corporate greed, gas companies, Rus-
sia, and whatever else may be as a 
source of inflation. But I think that 
only serves to deflect blame, obscure 
the truth, and prevent us from coming 
to an agreement where we can then 
begin to solve this. 
I think the President became more 
interested in inflation after seeing his 
plummeting approval rate. He is now 
talking about inflation being a top pri-
ority of the administration. In fact, 
just recently he wrote an op-ed in The 
Wall Street Journal titled: ‘‘My Plan 
for Fighting Inflation.’’ 
I will talk just briefly about that. He 
begins the op-ed by arguing that our 
economy is actually in great shape, 
which strikes me as being about as out 
of touch as you can get. He apparently 
isn’t talking to the constituents whom 
I talk to on a regular basis. 
He lays out three points for com-
bating inflation. 
One, well, it is the Fed’s job; two, his 
energy policies and build back better 
agenda will fix it; and three, a supposed 
newfound commitment to fiscal dis-
cipline. 
In the op-ed he said that he welcomes 
debate on his plan. And maybe tonight 
that is what we are doing. We are de-
bating what really are the ways that 
we can combat inflation and whether 
his plan really will work. 
So let’s talk about the Fed because 
the President’s first point was arguing 
that it is the Fed’s responsibility to 
control inflation. And the President, 
again, has spent 11⁄2 years pushing poli-
cies that fuel inflation and then points 
to the Fed to fix the problem. 
Now, I do agree that the Fed has a 
role in controlling inflation, and essen-
tially the tool they have will be to 
raise interest rates to try to slow down 
the economy. But we all know that 
raising rates will be required, which 
they are doing now. Tomorrow they are 
talking about a 0.75 percent increase in 
the Federal rate, which is a significant 
increase, and they are talking about 
doing that multiple times. So it has 
significant consequences on our econ-
omy both in the short and long term. 
What do I mean by that? 
It makes it more expensive for busi-
nesses to borrow money. It makes it 
more expensive for individuals to bor-
row money. We are seeing home mort-
gage rates go up significantly already 
that will continue to do that, and hun-
dreds of thousands fewer people today 
are able to afford to buy a home when 
they could have done so when they 
were lower. So there will be a decrease 
for demand of goods and services 
which, again, is an attempt to tamp 
down the economy to decrease demand 
and decrease spending. 
The other entity that is affected by 
rising interest rates is the Federal 
Government. We are $30 trillion in 
debt. This chart shows what will hap-
pen as interest rates are being raised. 
By just raising one-half of a percent— 
you see the first line—will increase in-
terest costs over the next 10 years by 
$1.3 trillion. Going up 2 percent will in-
crease interest costs by $5.3 trillion 
over the next 10 years. 
Now, let’s put that in perspective. 
That would be, under the President’s 
plan, 1.5 times our current Medicare 
spending, 1.4 times our current defense 
spending, and 11 times our current vet-
erans’ healthcare spending. So every 
single dollar that we have to pay in ad-
ditional interest costs will be taking 
dollars from programs that help people 
across the country and will be taking 
dollars out of our economy. 
Increasing national debt is also a 
threat to our national security. Mr. 
Speaker, I also wrote an op-ed in May 
that was published in The Washington 
Times. 
I include in the RECORD the article. 
[From the Washington Times, May 17, 2022] 
WHEN THE BALLOON POPS: INFLATING OUR 
DEBT AND UNDERMINING OUR SECURITY 
(By Rep. Lloyd Smucker) 
OPINION: 
Twelve years ago, Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Chair 
Adm. 
Michael 
Mullen 
famously 
warned, ‘‘the most significant threat to our 
national security is our debt.’’ At the time, 
the nation’s federal debt was roughly $13.5 
trillion. Congress and our government have 
completely ignored Mr. Mullen’s warning; 
our national debt has now surpassed $30 tril-
lion and is growing exponentially. 
China now owns $1.1 trillion of that debt, 
the second-highest total among foreign sov-
ereign governments, a clear threat to our na-
tional security. If current trends continue, 
that number will increase to $1.7 trillion 
over the next decade. 
Mr. Mullen recognized the tangible risks 
rising deficits have on our nation. Every dol-
lar spent servicing our debt, meaning dollars 
spent paying the interest on the debt already 
accrued, are dollars not spent on funding na-
tional priorities. Currently, the Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that we will 
pay an average of $543 billion per year on 
just the interest for our nation’s $30 trillion- 
plus in national debt. 
President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget 
only worsens the problem. Under the presi-
dent’s proposed spending plan, interest pay-
ments would jump to an average of $756 bil-
lion per year, meaning $2 trillion more in 
total interest payments over the next 10 
years than currently projected. 
Our country would be paying over $1 tril-
lion in interest payments to service the debt 
by 2031. To put that in perspective, by 2031, 
we would pay 1.5 times our current Medicare 
outlays and 1.4 times our current defense 
budget on interest payments. As Undersecre-
tary of Defense Comptroller Michael McCord 
agreed during our discussion at the House 
Budget Committee, the increasing burden of 
mandatory interest payments threatens to 
crowd out discretionary spending priorities, 
such as our defense budget. 
Mr. Mullen warned us that our debt would 
soon reach a point where we spent more pay-
ing off interest than funding our military, 
risking our national security. Under the 
president’s budget, that warning will be 
proved true in 2029. Given that China owns 
an increasing amount of our debt, those in-
terest payments will directly fund the inter-
ests of an economic, and perhaps military, 
adversary. 
Unfortunately, rampant, irresponsible fed-
eral spending has compounding consequences 
on our economy. 
Mr. Biden and House Democrats are wreak-
ing havoc on our economy and fueling infla-
tion. Spurred by the $1.9 trillion American 
Rescue Plan Act, the inflationary impacts of 
which were forecasted and have been con-
firmed, our government ran a $2.8 trillion 
deficit in 2021. The results of this massive 
spending influx by the federal government 
have been immediate and drastic: The Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics reports that the

June 14, 2022 
consumer price index for all items rose 8.3 
percent over the past year, near the highest 
level in over 40 years. 
Inflation not only harms our economy in 
the immediate future but also has long-term 
impacts on the cost of servicing our debt. In 
March, in an attempt to tamp down Mr. 
Biden’s inflation, the Federal Reserve Board 
raised benchmark interest rates by 0.25 per-
centage points. On May 4, the Fed raised in-
terest rates an additional 0.50 percentage 
points, the largest single increase since 2000. 
These rate hikes will have a ripple effect 
across our economy, including on servicing 
our national debt. As inflation persists this 
year, the Fed is expected to continue to raise 
rates at least 5 more times this year, with 
rates expected to surpass 1.9 percent. 
The Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget, a nonpartisan nonprofit research or-
ganization, reports, ‘‘If interest rates are 50 
basis points (0.50 percentage points) higher 
than projected, average annual interest costs 
would increase by $94 billion per year.’’ Even 
higher interest rate hikes will have even 
more devastating impacts. If interest rates 
were to exceed CBO’s projections by 2 per-
centage points each year, similar to the 
Fed’s expected actions for this year, our na-
tion could spend an additional $3.7 trillion 
servicing our debt over the next decade. 
This does not even factor in expected 
spending increases under Mr. Biden’s budg-
et—this is just the impact of what has al-
ready been spent. My Republican colleagues 
on the House Budget Committee have pre-
pared an analysis titled ‘‘The Consequences 
of Higher Interest Rates to the Federal 
Budget,’’ which provides an even grimmer 
outlook on the long-term impacts of rate 
hikes on our nation’s fiscal strength. 
The Biden administration’s spending in-
creases the debt from the outset, and the 
Fed’s response to control inflation by raising 
rates balloons the cost of our debt even 
more. Our national security will falter. 
America will be forced to fund China’s rise. 
Generations yet to be born will be paying the 
price for Mr. Biden’s inflation. It is long past 
time for Congress to step up and rein in this 
out-of-control spending and inflation. 
Mr. SMUCKER. The article lays out 
how increased inflation ultimately un-
dermines our national security. 
China, perhaps our greatest adver-
sary of the next decade, now owns $1.1 
trillion of the national debt. That is 
the second highest total among foreign 
sovereign governments, and increased 
dependence on China is a clear threat 
to our national security. 
If the current trends continue, Chi-
na’s portion of our national debt will 
increase to $1.7 trillion over the next 
decade. Interest payments as they rise 
will mean more income for China and 
will directly fuel China’s growth mak-
ing them a stronger economic and mili-
tary adversary. 
Twelve years ago, Joint Chiefs of 
Staff 
Chairman 
Admiral 
Michael 
Mullen famously warned: ‘‘The most 
significant threat to our national secu-
rity is our debt.’’ That was 12 years 
ago. The most significant threat to our 
national security is our national debt. 
At that time, by the way, the Na-
tion’s Federal debt was roughly $13.5 
trillion. Now it is at $30 trillion and 
growing. 
What could be even worse is if our 
lenders lose faith in the ability of the 
United States to pay back and make 
good on those loans. If they essentially 
lose faith in the credit of the United 
States, that would be what we call a 
sovereign debt crisis which would have 
a major economic impact in the United 
States affecting every single American. 
By the way, that is not merely a hy-
pothetical. We have seen major nations 
face sovereign debt crises. In 2009 
Greece’s budget deficits totaled 12.7 
percent of its GDP. By 2012, Greece’s 
debt-to-GDP ratio was 160 percent. 
Under CRFB’s analysis our debt held 
by the public will reach 126 percent of 
GDP by 2032 with the anticipated in-
creased interest rates. If we don’t 
change this trajectory, this will put us 
well on the way to a fiscal calamity 
like Greece has experienced not long 
ago, just a few years ago. 
So it is long past time for the U.S. to 
get our fiscal house in order and aban-
don the reckless budgetary policies 
that sank the Greek economy at that 
time. 
Let’s talk just briefly about energy, 
Mr. Speaker, another big factor in the 
rising prices that we are seeing. This 
chart sort of blows me away. Average 
prices of gas in my hometown right 
now exceed $5 a gallon. Think about 
that, Mr. Speaker. Just a year and a 
half ago, 2 years ago, no one would 
have imagined that we would be spend-
ing $5 per gallon. You see the same 
kind of increases in home fuel, Mr. 
Speaker, heating costs, and so on. And 
the President blames oil and gas mar-
kets for that high inflation rate, and 
he focuses on the role of Russia in driv-
ing those. 
But do you know what is amazing, 
Mr. Speaker? 
Under President Trump when Presi-
dent Biden took office, our Nation was 
energy independent and becoming a net 
exporter of oil in 2019. Some of the very 
first actions that President Biden took 
were to halt drilling on Federal lands 
and to stop the Keystone pipeline. 
Even as prices went up, the administra-
tion doubled down on limiting the sup-
ply of our drilling. No new permits 
were approved. So it is a classic eco-
nomic formula. They dramatically in-
creased demand and reduced supply 
which led to the prices that we are see-
ing now. 
The President just put out his new 
budget. He says that now—really the 
first time I think since he has been in 
office—it is important to reduce defi-
cits. I welcome that. I think it is im-
portant that we reduce deficits. We 
have to reduce the debt long term. He 
claims credit for reducing the Federal 
deficit by $1.7 trillion this year due to 
the expiration of spending in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan which, by the way, is 
all deficit spending. He says that this 
reduction demonstrates a newfound 
commitment to fiscal discipline. 
Now, let’s just look at that for a lit-
tle bit. 
If I eat 10,000 calories today—which is 
way more than I need—and tomorrow I 
eat 5,000, well, that won’t make me a 
model. It doesn’t mean that I am on 
any kind of a diet. 
Look at this plan. This is the Presi-
dent’s budget straight from his budget 
documents. I get it. There was an 
anomaly during COVID. It was a chal-
lenge for all of us, and the deficit went 
way up during COVID. But look at the 
deficit before COVID which is the sec-
ond bar on the left side. 
And then coming out of COVID what 
happens? 
Do you see—if you take out the two 
COVID years which was an exception, 
an anomaly, do you see deficits declin-
ing at all? 
No. In fact, they are going up every 
single year. 
That is not fiscal responsibility. In 
fact, I call it swamp math, to say that 
we are reducing deficits when this is 
exactly what it looks like in their 
budget plan. It is swamp math. 
Mr. Speaker, if you set one foot out-
side the beltway, I can tell you that 
every single American who looks at 
this does not believe that we are reduc-
ing deficits in any way. 
b 2030 
I don’t mean that as a knock on the 
administration. Well, I guess I do mean 
it as a knock on the administration. 
But what I really mean to say is that 
we have to get serious about imple-
menting policies that will drive growth 
and that will result in lower deficits 
over time, or we will be going down 
that path of fiscal calamity. 
Besides this, the other thing that the 
President is calling for, still calling 
for, is what he calls the Build Back 
Better plan. This is outlined in his 
budget. 
Now, I call it build back bankrupt be-
cause it continues to put us on a path 
of a potential sovereign debt crisis. It 
certainly continues to build debt for 
our kids, our grandkids, and future 
generations. 
The build back bankrupt plan im-
poses new taxes, 36 new taxes, on 
Americans and dramatically increases 
spending beyond what you see here. 
This is what they want to do, while 
they are claiming to do this, which 
they are saying is reducing deficits. It 
makes no sense whatsoever. 
One of the other things I want to 
mention—I am running out of time 
here. 
It has just been recently that we 
have had this economy working on all 
cylinders, and we could be doing that 
again. This economy could be in a far 
different position if we implemented 
policies similar to what were done 
under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act under 
the previous administration. 
Just before COVID hit, we were see-
ing the impact. Almost every measure 
you could possibly take showed that 
the economy was working for the 
American people. By the way, middle- 
income American, the average house-
hold income increased by $6,000 per 
year. That is a real impact. People 
were feeling it, compared to a $3,500 
drop in real wages during this adminis-
tration.

The TCJA boosted workers’ pay-
checks. Income and wealth inequality 
fell. Real wages for the bottom 10 per-
cent, by the way, grew nearly twice as 
fast as the top 10 percent. Real wealth 
of the bottom 50 percent of households 
rose three times faster than that of the 
top 1 percent. 
Despite the challenges that we face 
now, I think hope is not lost. I am opti-
mistic that if we implement the right 
policies, America can once again work 
for the American people. We need to be 
committed to that. We need to have a 
discussion about what policies will 
work.

the generations to come will know of 
Your mighty acts. 
Today, give our lawmakers the sin-
gularity of heart to seek, find, and fol-
low Your will so that their legacy will

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we 
speak, the U.S. Senate is working on 
something not seen since the time we 
passed the Brady bill I authored nearly 
three decades ago: a bipartisan effort 
to draft meaningful gun safety legisla-
tion. 
For decades, the rhythms of the gun 
debate in Congress have followed a 
dispiriting pattern: a mass shooting 
takes place somewhere in America, in-
nocent people are slaughtered, families 
grieve and demand action, but gridlock 
takes over, and nothing—nothing—gets 
done. This was the cycle of inaction 
after Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Orlando, 
Charleston, Parkland, El Paso, At-
lanta, Pittsburgh, and so many others. 
But after Uvalde and Buffalo, perhaps— 
perhaps—this time could be different. 
To many Senators on both sides, this 
debate certainly feels different. With 
Sunday’s announcement of a bipartisan 
framework for gun legislation, we are 
further down the road to gun safety re-
form than we have been in a long time. 
I spoke with Senators CORNYN and 
MURPHY this morning, and they up-
dated me on their progress. They are 
working with the urgency the situation 
demands, and they are hopeful the leg-
islative text can be finalized in the 
coming days. 
I have assured my colleagues that 
once we get legislative text to a gun 
safety bill, I will move to hold a vote 
on the Senate floor as soon as possible. 
I hope that in the very near future, 
Democrats and Republicans can take 
the real momentum of the past few 
weeks and translate it into something 
that has escaped this Chamber for dec-
ades: voting on and passing long- 
sought gun safety reform. 
It is a rare opportunity for the Sen-
ate. So in order to reach our goal, we 
have to keep working with the same 
urgency and good faith that has carried 
us this far. 
For sure, the bipartisan framework is 
far from perfect, but if passed, it will 
unquestionably save lives and would be 
the most significant action on guns 
that the Senate has taken in nearly

three decades. If passed, it would en-
hance background checks for those 
under 21. It will help States with their 
red flag laws, preventing shootings be-
fore they happen. It will make it hard-
er for domestic abusers to acquire a 
weapon by closing the boyfriend loop-
hole. 
Significantly, this framework also 
calls for new punishment for gun traf-
fickers. We all know one of the biggest 
weaknesses in our country’s gun laws 
as they are today is that anyone can 
buy a gun in one State and then simply 
smuggle it into another. We could 
begin to fight against that with stiffer 
penalties on gun trafficking. 
Of course, this framework will help 
lower crime and reduce gun violence in 
our neighborhoods by increasing fund-
ing for mental health as well. And even 
on its own, funding for mental health 
with great increases in mental health 
problems that we see after COVID is 
very much needed. 
Taken together, the policies outlined 
by the bipartisan framework would be 
an important first step to saving lives. 
It would lay the foundation for a more 
sensible approach to gun safety in the 
future. It certainly is not everything 
Democrats want, but if we can save 
even one life—one life—our efforts will 
have been worth it. 
I hope that very soon the Senate can 
break the cycle of violence, grieving, 
and gridlock that has held firm for far 
too long. This is the best chance we 
have had in years to finally tell the 
American people that, yes, after the 
horrifying tragedies of Uvalde and Buf-
falo, this time—this time—will be dif-
ferent. 
We have more work to do so I urge 
my colleagues not to let this precious 
opportunity slip away. 
H.R. 3967 
Mr. President, now on the PACT Act, 
today, the Senate will continue consid-
eration of the Honoring Our PACT 
Act—the most ambitious and impor-
tant expansion of veteran healthcare 
benefits that we have seen in decades. 
Yesterday, we invoked cloture on the 
substitute amendment to the PACT 
Act with a very strong bipartisan vote, 
78 to 17. Seventy-eight votes, a clear 
indication that both sides want this 
bill passed through the Senate. There 
is no reason to delay that outcome. 
Today, we will continue working 
with our Republican colleagues to see 
if we can speed up consideration of this 
legislation. With Republican coopera-
tion, we could be done with the PACT 
Act as soon as tomorrow. 
We need to pass the PACT Act ASAP 
because our veterans have waited long 
enough for their healthcare benefits to 
treat complications from toxic expo-
sure. Over the last two decades, an es-
timated 3.5 million servicemembers 
were exposed to dangerous chemicals 
while in the line of duty while risking 
their lives for us. 
Burn pits were a common method of 
eliminating all sorts of waste through-
out Iraq and Afghanistan, from every-
day trash to hazardous and poisonous 
materials. After returning home, many 
veterans developed terrible diseases be-
cause of their exposure to these toxic 
waste dumps. But even so, nearly 80 
percent of all disability claims related 
to burn pits have been denied by the 
Veterans’ Administration. What an in-
dignity. What an injustice. No veteran 
should ever have to carry the burden of 
treating complications from toxic ex-
posure alone, and we can change that 
with this bill. 
There is every reason in the world to 
get the PACT Act done quickly. Both 
parties want it, our veterans deserve it, 
and the time is long past for us to 
make a change at the VA. 
OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT 
Mr. 
President, 
on 
shipping, 
last 
night, finally, the House overwhelm-
ingly approved the Senate’s Ocean 
Shipping Reform Act—the most signifi-
cant maritime reform law passed by 
Congress in years. 
The inflation-fighting shipping bill 
now goes to the President’s desk for 
signature, finally providing relief to 
American 
exporters 
and 
consumers 
alike. 
Shipping reform is exactly the kind 
of bill that can make a difference to 
the American people: It fights infla-
tion. It relieves our supply chains. It 
helps small businesses and consumers 
alike. Not too much has been written 
about this bill because, sadly, the way 
our world and media work, if there is 
not a big conflict, they don’t write 
much about it. But this is very impor-
tant. 
If high prices are our No. 1 nemesis, 
one of the main reasons is the ships 
piled up at our ports. We have all seen 
the pictures outside the ports of L.A. 
and Seattle and Savannah and Norfolk 
and New York, New Jersey. This is 
causing people to pay more. It is no 
one’s fault. It is COVID-related, and 
now there is a big rush to make up for 
the delays that COVID caused. 
We have to do something about it, 
and we have. There are many frus-
trating reasons why prices are going up 
right now, but one of the main ones is 
abuses from ocean carriers. 
Over the course of the pandemic—lis-
ten to this, folks. Over the course of 
the pandemic, unfair shipping practices 
led carriers to increase prices by as 
much as 1,000 percent—1,000-percent in-
crease in prices in shipping. And who is 
paying that? The average family in 
America and the average exporting 
business. 
Even worse, foreign carriers often-
times refuse to even transport U.S. 
goods overseas. And by now we are see-
ing the results: backlogs at the ports of 
L.A. and Seattle and Georgia and New 
York and New Jersey and other major 
hubs. 
This is not just a problem for the 
coasts. When backlog occurs at the 
ports in Los Angeles, it hurts farmers 
in Minnesota or Wisconsin. It hurts 
truckers and tech companies and man-
ufacturers in mom-and-pop shops all 
over the country. And most of all, it 
hurts American consumers. 
Our shipping reform bill will fix this 
by making it harder for ocean carriers 
to unreasonably refuse American goods 
at our ports, while strengthening the 
Federal Maritime Commission’s powers 
to stop abusive practices by foreign 
carriers. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI and 
my House colleagues who worked to 
pass this bill. And special thanks goes 
to Senators KLOBUCHAR and THUNE for 
authoring 
the 
legislation, 
as 
well 
Chairman CANTWELL who used her leg-
islative skills, which are indeed very, 
very fine. She shepherded the bill 
through this Chamber. Because of the 
hard work of these folks, shipping re-
form will now become law. American 
consumers will soon feel the benefit. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
CRIME 
Mr. MCCONNELL. A few months ago, 
from this desk, I talked about the re-
sults of a recall election in San Fran-
cisco. In February, a multilingual, 
multiethnic coalition in San Francisco 
stood up for common sense and re-
jected three members of the far-left 
school board who had prioritized woke 
lunacy over the basics of education. 
Well, last week, these same fed-up 
citizens provided a sequel. Even the 
deep-blue Bay area decided they had 
had enough—enough—with their rad-
ical-left 
district 
attorney—a 
pros-
ecutor in name only—who had become 
nationally famous for running a soft- 
on-crime experiment. 
As deaths from drug overdoses sky-
rocketed, his office chose to almost en-
tirely stop prosecuting drug dealing. 
Burglaries shot up 50 percent. Chain 
stores had to close locations because of 
rampant shoplifting. One person who 
had been arrested five times in 6 
months in 2020 was let out every time— 
every single time—until he killed two 
women with a stolen car. Liberals ac-
tually bragged about how they had cut 
down incarceration rates, even as dis-
order swallowed up more and more of 
the city. 
The citizens were fed up—fed up— 
with being the far-left’s guinea pigs. 
They flocked to the ballot box, and 
they voted for change. 
This phenomenon is not only playing 
out in San Francisco, it is nation-
wide—nationwide. For years, the far 
left has zeroed in on local prosecutors 
and district attorneys as juicy opportu-
nities to make America radically soft-
er on crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2921 
June 14, 2022 
According to recent news reports, for 
example, one far-left billionaire do-
nated more than $1 million each to the 
political campaigns of soft-on-crime 
prosecutors in Chicago, New York, Los 
Angeles, and Philadelphia. According 
to one group’s analysis, the army of 
soft-on-crime prosecutors supported by 
this one donor—this one donor—and his 
networks oversees as much as 20 per-
cent of the Nation’s entire population. 
Once in office, many of these pros-
ecutors set about abusing their author-
ity by basically unilaterally decrimi-
nalizing various crimes that neither 
voters nor legislators have actually de-
criminalized in reality. As the attorney 
general of Virginia put it recently, ‘‘In-
stead of trying to change the law . . . 
these groups are electing prosecutors 
who simply ignore it.’’ 
As this liberal campaign has been 
playing out at the State and local 
level, we have seen violent crime surge 
all across the country. Here are just a 
few recent news reports. 
From 
Minnesota: 
‘‘Robberies, 
as-
saults, and gun crimes are causing 
waves of anxiety and fear among subur-
ban residents across the Twin Cities.’’ 
From Colorado: ‘‘Since the beginning 
of the pandemic . . . murders had gone 
up 47 percent, some types of property 
crime had nearly doubled, and [the] sei-
zures of fentanyl and methamphet-
amine had quadrupled’’ in just the last 
year. 
Atlanta ‘‘saw a 30-year record in 
homicides last year [in 2021],’’ and 2022 
has been looking actually even worse. 
At least as of a few months ago, both 
murders and rapes were way ahead of 
even that 2021 pace. 
Residents of Phoenix who try to use 
public transit to escape soaring gas 
prices have found out that ‘‘assaults 
and drug crime in and around public 
transportation have risen over the last 
five years.’’ 
Philadelphia is reporting an 80-per-
cent increase in assaults aboard buses. 
In my hometown of Louisville, we are 
struggling as well. ‘‘Over the past sev-
eral years, violent crime has sharply 
risen across the city, breaking grue-
some records including record homi-
cides and assaults.’’ And we have seen 
carjacking ‘‘more than triple in the 
[last] 
five 
years.’’ 
Last 
weekend 
alone—last weekend alone—Louisville 
saw 3 homicides and 10 nonfatal shoot-
ings. Five teenagers and a 9-year-old 
were shot during a single altercation at 
my hometown’s Big Four Bridge. Vio-
lent criminals turned a popular attrac-
tion for families and tourists into a lit-
eral war zone. 
Stable prices, border security, and 
public safety are three of the most 
basic deliverables that any government 
owes to its citizens—strike one, strike 
two, and strike three for Democrats at 
the Federal, State, and local level. 
That explains one last headline I will 
mention this morning: ‘‘Americans are 
more worried about crime than at any 
other time this century.’’ 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, the latest news from Ukraine 
confirms that our friends need more ro-
bust weaponry, and they need it fast. 
‘‘Outgunned 
Ukraine 
Needs 
More 
Weapons Fast as Russia Advances, Offi-
cials Say.’’ 
‘‘Ukraine Pleads for Weapons, Saying 
Russia Has Much More Artillery.’’ 
The people of Ukraine have inspired 
the world with their resilience, but re-
sisting Russian aggression takes reli-
able supplies of lethal force. 
As the Biden administration con-
tinues to provide shipments and prod 
our allies, they must adopt the kind of 
strong and positive posture that has 
eluded them at earlier points in the 
conflict. 
As early as last November, I was urg-
ing sanctions for deterrence and push-
ing for NDAA provisions to send en-
hanced 
lethal 
aid 
last 
November. 
Throughout December and January, I 
urged the President to bolster NATO’s 
eastern flank with more U.S. forces 
and get more weapons to Ukrainian 
forces before—before—Russia attacked. 
In February, I called on President 
Biden to anticipate Russian manipula-
tion of the energy markets and back 
off his own holy war against domestic 
American production. But for months, 
the Biden administration seemed mute, 
seemed actually more focused on deter-
ring itself than deterring Putin—too 
much hesitation, too much hemming 
and hawing, too little preventive ac-
tion in advance. 
The United States cannot make the 
same mistakes again with prolonged 
dithering over whether to provide 
longer range or more powerful weap-
ons. That is where we are now. It is 
time to get Ukraine what it needs to 
finish this fight, including artillery 
and long-range rockets, and strongly 
and firmly push our European allies to 
do the same. The wealthiest European 
countries need to move fast to do their 
part—no more hesitation, and quit 
making excuses. 
This war has carried terrible human 
costs for the Ukrainian people. We can-
not bring back the thousands who have 
been lost, but with strong assistance, 
we can help Ukraine limit future 
losses, reduce the risk of greater con-
flict, and create a deterring precedent 
for other would-be aggressors, like 
China. 
There is another area where the 
Ukraine crisis has showcased the need 
to take decisive action quickly while 
there is still time. That is with respect 
to our own defense industrial base and 
our supplies of critical arms. 
Equipping Ukraine has seriously de-
pleted our own stockpiles of Javelins 
and Stingers. According to the Sec-
retary of the Army, the U.S. military 
has ‘‘taken some risk to our own readi-
ness.’’ This sounds exactly like the sort 
of situation that prompted the creation 
of the Defense Production Act, but 
thus far, we have heard far more from 
Washington Democrats about using the 
DPA to fast-track green energy boon-
doggles than to expand production ca-
pacity for critical weapons and muni-
tions. 
Our allies and our partners are inter-
ested in buying American military 
technology. This should be a win-win: 
allies spending their own money to 
strengthen 
themselves 
by 
buying 
American and making our militaries 
more interoperable in the process. But 
too often, our partners are hamstrung 
by American constraints on the proc-
ess, like the heel-dragging bureaucracy 
that runs our military sales, and lag-
ging production schedules. 
We must adequately stockpile weap-
ons and munitions for our own military 
and have sufficient supplies and pro-
duction capacity to arm our friends, 
and we need to do this before it is too 
late. 
Building up our own stores and up-
grading our allies’ is the best way we 
can avoid nightmare scenarios down 
the road where America could be forced 
into a terrible choice between commit-
ting U.S. troops to a conflict or doing 
nothing. The remedy is to help our al-
lies upgrade their military capabilities 
in advance. 
Of course, this takes money. All the 
serious preparations and military mod-
ernization that it will take to compete 
with Russia and China require re-
sources. Tomorrow, the Armed Serv-
ices Committee will mark up the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. This 
is a key opportunity to show that both 
parties are serious about the real 
growth in defense spending that it will 
take to keep us on the cutting edge. 
The Biden administration’s defense 
budget request was woefully insuffi-
cient. The President has proposed a 
real-dollar cut for defense spending 
after President Biden’s own inflation. 
Our colleagues on the committee 
must help Congress to deliver an NDAA 
that provides for real, robust growth 
above inflation so that we can mod-
ernize our forces, ensure adequate in-
ventories of critical weapons and muni-
tions, and keep America safe. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is 
hard to believe it was 50 years ago this 
week—50 years ago—when five men 
were caught breaking into the offices 
of the Democratic National Committee 
here in Washington. 
Two years after that, the so-called 
Watergate break-in and the coverup by 
the Nixon White House, it brought 
down the President. 
For nearly half a century, the Water-
gate scandal really ranked as Amer-
ica’s greatest constitutional test since

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2922 
June 14, 2022 
the Civil War—then came January 6, 
2021. 
An angry mob, summoned by a de-
feated President, attacked this Capitol 
building, attacked this Chamber, and 
those of us who were in it knew it was 
an attempt to overthrow an election, 
an election which Donald Trump lost 
but never admitted. 
How did we respond? 
Well, the proposal was made—the 
right proposal—to create a bipartisan 
commission to investigate what hap-
pened on January 6, 2021. Unfortu-
nately, the Republicans, led by Senator 
MCCONNELL in the Senate, filibustered 
the creation of an independent com-
mission to investigate January 6. For-
tunately, the House went forward to 
proceed on its own on a bipartisan 
basis to get to the truth. 
Now, after 11 months and 1,000 inter-
views—more than 1,000—the bipartisan 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol is 
sharing its findings with America, and 
the revelations are so damning. 
In its first two public hearings, the 
committee has shown that the attack 
on the Capitol was not a demonstration 
that changed spontaneously and be-
came a riot. The attack on our Na-
tion’s Capitol, the attack on this 
Chamber, was the result of a plan: a 
violent effort to prevent the peaceful 
transfer of power from the Trump ad-
ministration to the Biden administra-
tion, to stop the peaceful transition of 
power in America for the first time in 
our history. 
To quote Congresswoman LIZ CHE-
NEY, 
the 
former 
President 
Donald 
Trump ‘‘summoned the mob, assembled 
the mob, and lit the flame of this at-
tack.’’ 
When the mob beat our police offi-
cers and ransacked the Capitol—going 
through our desks here on the floor, 
posing for pictures where the Presiding 
Officer is now sitting, all sorts of 
things to make them look famous with 
their friends at the expense of the in-
tegrity of this building and this Cham-
ber. 
They beat the police officers. Donald 
Trump did nothing to stop them—noth-
ing. He wouldn’t order the National 
Guard to defend the Capitol, the Sen-
ate, the House. He watched the may-
hem on TV, rewinding it to watch it 
over and over again. He gloried in the 
moment. 
When the crowd threatened to hang 
Vice President Pence, Donald Trump 
said, ‘‘He deserves it.’’ Deserves it. The 
Vice President of the United States de-
serves it. 
His own advisers told him repeatedly 
that the voter fraud conspiracy theo-
ries that he was pedaling were false. 
They were called ‘‘idiotic,’’ ‘‘amateur-
ish,’’ ‘‘detached from reality.’’ Who 
said that? The former Attorney Gen-
eral serving Donald Trump said it in 
describing the false claims that Presi-
dent Trump continued to pedal. 
Donald Trump was told the truth 
over and over again, and yet he contin-
ued to push his deadly Big Lie. 
He deliberately—the former Presi-
dent of the United States—deliberately 
undermined America’s faith in our 
election process to overturn the elec-
tion and to hold onto power no matter 
what. 
He used the Big Lie to make big 
bucks. We learned that yesterday— 
quarter of a million dollars—quarter of 
a billion dollars in donations, including 
millions of dollars for an election de-
fense fund that didn’t exist. 
In a coming hearing, the committee 
will show how Donald Trump pressured 
the Justice Department into helping 
him overturn the election. I know a lit-
tle bit about that. Our Senate Judici-
ary Committee, which I chair, docu-
mented this attempt to subvert the 
Justice Department in an 8-month in-
vestigation and report that we pro-
duced last fall. We produced this report 
in a bipartisan fashion, inviting Repub-
lican and Democratic Members of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee to witness 
the testimony of key individuals and to 
ask questions themselves. 
We interviewed former Justice offi-
cials like Jeffrey Rosen and Richard 
Donoghue, the then-acting Attorney 
General and Deputy Attorney General, 
who resisted Donald Trump’s pressure 
to take over the Justice Department. 
They told us how repeatedly they in-
formed the former President that his 
bogus election claims were false. They 
told us how Trump, nevertheless, asked 
the Justice Department to ‘‘Just say 
the election was corrupt—and leave the 
rest to me and Republican Congress-
men.’’ 
And they resisted Donald Trump’s 
plan to replace Jeffrey Rosen with the 
Big Lie lawyer Jeffrey Clark, who 
wanted the Justice Department to help 
overturn the election. 
The facts that the Senate Judiciary 
Committee uncovered are damning. 
The January 6 committee will unveil 
those—many of their own discovery 
and reporting and some that we sent to 
them from our testimony that we gath-
ered in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
We came close to losing this democ-
racy in America on January 6. I believe 
that by laying out the truth for us and 
for future generations, members of the 
committee are performing a public 
service of heroic proportions. 
It is sad—sad—that given an oppor-
tunity of a bipartisan commission, just 
as we had with 9/11, that the Senate Re-
publicans stopped it. Why? It is a ques-
tion they are going to have to answer. 
POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Mr. President, on another topic, we 
speak 
often 
in 
the 
Senate 
about 
threats to peace and freedom around 
the world: Russia’s unprovoked inva-
sion of Ukraine, China’s brutal repres-
sion of the Uighurs, the dismantling of 
democracy in Hong Kong, Nicaragua’s 
repressive dictatorship, and more. 
In each of these struggles, there are 
some brave men and women who are 
prepared to risk their liberty and their 
lives to defend democracy and dignity. 
Many of them languish in prison as po-
litical prisoners. Their captors often 
try to torment them by telling them: 
The world has forgotten you; no one 
knows you are here. 
Well, I want to make sure that that 
doesn’t happen by coming to floor of 
the Senate and sharing some of these 
stories. Today, let me tell you about a 
few of them. 
Let me start with a Russian opposi-
tion leader of remarkable courage: 
Vladimir Kara-Murza. He was poisoned 
twice by the Russian spy agency FSB, 
in 2015 and 2017. He not only survived 
that, but he continued his work for a 
democratic Russia. 
He was a close friend of Senator John 
McCain, who asked him personally to 
serve as a pallbearer at his funeral. 
I met Mr. Kara-Murza in March, 3 
weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. 
He was living in Washington at the 
time with his wife and three children, 
and he told me he was going back to 
Russia. He had work to do. 
On April 11, he was arrested in Mos-
cow, 1 day after giving an interview in 
which he called Vladimir Putin’s gov-
ernment a ‘‘team of murderers.’’ 
His wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, also 
an advocate for democracy in Russia, 
who I expect to meet with later on this 
week, said: ‘‘He’s doing as well as you 
can do in a Russian prison that is noto-
rious for torture, humiliation, and mis-
treatment.’’ 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 
Senate 
unanimously passed a resolution I led 
with Senator MARCO RUBIO, calling on 
Russia to release Vladimir Kara-Murza 
immediately, 
along 
with 
Alexei 
Navalny, another Russian opposition 
leader, and thousands of others—Rus-
sians jailed for speaking up against re-
pression, for even mentioning the pos-
sibility 
of 
the 
murderous 
war 
in 
Ukraine. 
It is time for America to stand up for 
Mr. Kara-Murza and those like him 
who have shown extraordinary cour-
age. 
Senator Leila DeLima is a leading 
human rights advocate in the Phil-
ippines. She is a state senator who just 
passed her fifth year in jail. 
Here she is in her cell. 
Why is she in prison for 5 years? She 
criticized the repressive regime of 
President Rodrigo Duterte. 
From time to time, she writes to me 
from her prison cell. Let me share a 
short excerpt of a recent letter: 
Warm greetings from my detention head-
quarters . . . I do not know for how long I 
will remain behind bars but there is one 
thing that I am sure of—my will to fight for 
what is right continues to be undeterred. 
Recently, two key witnesses in the 
sham case against Senator DeLima re-
canted their testimony, proving what 
we already know: The case against her 
is contrived. It is a travesty of justice. 
Many Filipino Americans in Illinois 
tell me they are deeply concerned 
about the accountability and democ-
racy and its prospects in the Phil-
ippines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2923 
June 14, 2022 
The incoming Marcos regime can 
demonstrate its commitment to a 
democratic Philippines by ending the 
harassment of journalists and making 
Senator DeLima’s release one of its 
first priorities. 
Let me now turn to Saudi Arabia— 
timely. 
I have been troubled by the human 
rights record of this Kingdom, includ-
ing the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, for 
which there is no real accountability 
yet. 
This year brought a bit of welcome 
news. Writer Raif Badawi was finally 
freed from prison after completing a 10- 
year 
prison 
sentence 
for 
dubious 
charges about his peaceful writings. 
I hope that the Saudis will allow Raif 
the dignity of reuniting with his brave 
wife, Ensaf Haidar, who I met in Wash-
ington, and their three children, now 
living in Canada. 
Badawi’s lawyer, Waleed Abu al- 
Khair, a leading human rights de-
fender, is still in prison. He was con-
victed in Saudi Arabia’s Specialized 
Criminal Court, usually reserved for 
terrorists. 
I appeal to the Saudi Government to 
free Waleed and to allow Raif to be re-
united with his family. 
These gestures would be particularly 
notable in light of President Biden’s 
upcoming visit. 
Finally, let me turn to the United 
Arab Emirates. 
This is Ahmed Mansoor, one of the 
last major human rights voices in the 
Emirates. 
He was arrested in 2017 for using blog 
posts to advocate for reform and 
human rights in his nation. He was 
convicted of charges of threatening the 
UAE’s state security and social har-
mony, they sentenced him to 10 years 
in prison. He has been there for more 
than 5, at times, in solitary confine-
ment, isolated from other prisoners, no 
contact with his family. He has report-
edly been tortured. 
Despite the dismal conditions of his 
incarceration, he remains steadfast in 
his commitment to human rights. He 
has conducted multiple hunger strikes 
to protest prison conditions. 
I appeal to the United Arab Emir-
ates’ new President, Muhammad bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan, to take this oppor-
tunity early in his Presidency to dem-
onstrate compassion and courage by re-
leasing Mr. Mansoor. 
America’s strength around the world 
comes not only from our military and 
economic might but from the power of 
our values. Over the years, I have 
heard from many political prisoners. 
They tell me the support this body, of 
Congress, of America, and so many oth-
ers in our government sustained them 
through the lonely, desperate times 
they spent in jail for days and weeks 
and months and years. 
I will close with the words of Vladi-
mir Kara-Murza. This is from a recent 
op-ed he wrote for the Washington Post 
from his Russian prison. He wrote: 
The prisoner’s worst nightmare is the 
thought of being forgotten . . . I always 
knew how true those words were—and how 
important were international campaigns of 
solidarity with prisoners of conscience. I now 
feel it with my own skin. 
To 
Vladimir 
Kara-Murza, 
Raif 
Badawi, Waleed Abulkhair, Senator 
Leila de Lima, and Ahmed Mansoor, I 
say: You are not forgotten, and we will 
continue to advocate for your freedom. 
Let me also close by acknowledging 
that a member of my staff, Chris 
Homan, has really inspired me to take 
on this cause, and he works at it dili-
gently—our reward, an occasional po-
litical prisoner makes it here to my of-
fice here in Washington. One of them 
from Africa presented me with basi-
cally a baton that he had made while 
in prison with my name on it because 
he heard that I remembered him and 
spoke of him on the floor of the Senate. 
I would say to my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle: Make this part of 
your responsibility as a U.S. Senator. 
Find these people, these heroes who are 
sadly wasting away in prison and re-
member them on this floor. It can 
make a difference. Some will be re-
leased; all will remember the fact that 
you stood up for them at a time of 
great need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the latest 
inflation numbers came out on Friday, 
and it has become par for the course in 
the Biden economy that they weren’t 
pretty. 
Inflation hit 8.6 percent in May, the 
worst inflation since December of 1981. 
Grocery prices increased nearly 12 per-
cent on average. Eggs were up 32 per-
cent; chicken was up 17 percent; milk 
was up 15 percent; and the list goes on 
and on. 
Gas prices were up 48 percent. Since 
President Biden took office, the price 
of gas has more than doubled. Gas is at 
$5 a gallon, and the price of diesel, so 
essential to our Nation’s farmers and 
ranchers, is even worse. The problem 
is, there is no end in sight. JPMorgan 
estimates that gas prices could exceed 
$6 a gallon by August. Other energy 
costs have also increased with elec-
tricity up 12 percent and utility gas 
service up 30 percent. 
By one estimate, inflation is costing 
American households $460 per month. 
That is right: $460 per month. It is no 
surprise that in a recent poll, 83 per-
cent of respondents—83 percent—de-
scribe the state of the economy as 
‘‘poor’’ or ‘‘not so good’’ or that just 27 
percent said they have a good chance of 
improving their standard of living. 
President Biden likes to talk about 
creating ‘‘an economy that works for 
working families.’’ Well, I have news 
for the President. This economy is not 
working for working families. Working 
families can’t absorb an additional $460 
a month. They have to cut back. They 
have to put off needed car repairs or 
eliminate a family vacation or cut 
down on milk for their kids. The Presi-
dent said the other day that ‘‘[the 
economy] is strong as can be but for in-
flation, but for gas and food.’’ 
But for gas and food? Well, I have to 
tell you, gas and food prices are two 
pretty essential economic measures for 
families. 
Moms and dads wondering how they 
can afford to fill up their cars to get to 
work or get their kids to baseball prac-
tice don’t care how good the President 
says the economy is when the price of 
a tank of gas has more than doubled 
since the President took office. 
I guess we can at least be glad the 
Democrats and the President have fi-
nally started acknowledging our infla-
tion crisis. For months last year, as in-
flation climbed, the administration 
dismissed those concerns. Even as it 
became more and more clear that we 
had a long-term problem on our hands, 
the President and congressional Demo-
crats spent their time focusing not on 
solutions to our inflation crisis but on 
a massive spending spree almost guar-
anteed to make our inflation problem 
worse. 
That is right. Let’s remember how we 
got here. When President Biden took 
office, inflation was at 1.4 percent, well 
within the Fed’s target inflation rate 
of 2 percent. And it might have stayed 
there had Democrats not decided to 
pass a massive and partisan $1.9 tril-
lion spending spree under the guise of 
COVID relief mere weeks after the Con-
gress had passed a fifth bipartisan 
COVID bill that met essentially all 
current pressing COVID needs. 
The Democrats’ so-called American 
Rescue Plan sent a lot of unnecessary 
government money into the economy, 
and the economy overheated as a re-
sult. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. 
Here is what one Democratic econo-
mist who worked in the Obama admin-
istration had to say on the subject: 
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan 
passed in the early days of the Biden admin-
istration will go down in history as an ex-
traordinary policy mistake. 
Let me just repeat that. 
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan 
passed in the early days of the Biden admin-
istration will go down in history as an ex-
traordinary policy mistake. 
That is a direct quote from a Demo-
cratic economist who worked in the 
Obama administration. 
Democrats were warned that the 
American Rescue Plan ran the risk of 
overstimulating the economy, but they 
went ahead anyway. What is almost 
worse was their subsequent decision to 
pursue another massive spending spree, 
their so-called Build Back Better plan, 
even after it had become clear that 
their first spending spree had helped 
plunge our economy into a serious in-
flationary crisis. 
Even now—even now—as Americans 
deal with the worst inflation in dec-
ades, it is looking like Democrats are 
trying to revive elements of their Build 
Back Better plan and use reconcili-
ation rules to pass yet another par-
tisan spending spree. It is the triumph

of Big Government ideology over eco-
nomic reality. If Democrats succeed in 
passing 
another 
partisan 
spending 
spree using reconciliation rules, Amer-
icans’ economic situation is going to 
get even worse. 
Unfortunately, there is no easy solu-
tion to the Democrats’ largely self-in-
flicted inflation crisis, but the first pri-
ority is to do no more harm. That 
means 
no 
more 
partisan 
spending 
sprees like the Democrats’ Build Back 
Better plan. 
Another 
big 
priority 
should 
be 
unleashing American energy produc-
tion—in particular, the domestic pro-
duction of oil and gas—to ease energy 
prices. High gas and energy prices fuel 
higher consumer prices across the 
board—no 
question 
about 
it. 
Unleashing American energy produc-
tion would not only help reduce the 
price of gas, but it could also help rein 
in prices for other commodities. Unfor-
tunately, 
the 
President 
has 
dem-
onstrated a clear hostility to conven-
tional energy production, which is dis-
couraging investment in American en-
ergy and prolonging the current gas 
price situation. 
Another thing we should be doing to 
help make life easier for consumers is 
trying to ease supply chain woes 
whether that involves removing bur-
densome trucking regulations or pass-
ing legislation like my Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act. 
I am pleased that both Democrats 
and Republicans have come together to 
support my bipartisan bill, which I in-
troduced, along with Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, earlier this year. I am particu-
larly grateful to my fellow South Da-
kotan, Representative DUSTY JOHNSON, 
who 
helped 
usher 
this 
legislation 
through the House of Representatives. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
would help ease supply chain pressures 
by addressing unfair ocean carrier 
practices, speeding up the resolution of 
detention and demurrage disputes, and 
improving the movement of goods at 
our Nation’s ports. It won’t solve our 
Nation’s inflation crisis, but it should 
help make life easier for U.S. export-
ers, importers, and consumers alike. 
I am very pleased that this legisla-
tion passed the House of Representa-
tives yesterday and that it will soon be 
on its way to the President’s desk, and 
I hope that we will be able to pursue 
more bipartisan propositions to help 
make life easier for American families. 
Democrats’ big-spending, Big Govern-
ment agenda has resulted in a lot of 
pain for working families. If President 
Biden and Democrats really want to 
make life better for ordinary Ameri-
cans, they will decisively reject any 
further spending sprees and work with 
Republicans to do what we can to al-
leviate the inflation crisis the Demo-
crats have helped create.

GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want 
to report that we are making serious 
progress in our bipartisan effort to re-
spond to the shooting in Uvalde, TX, 
and other places around the country. 
Over the last few weeks, I have been 
working, in particular, with Senator 
MURPHY, Senator SINEMA, and Senator 
TILLIS on mental health and school 
safety reforms, and we have narrowed 
the scope of our discussions to provi-
sions that we believe can earn broad bi-
partisan support in the Senate, and a 
number of our colleagues on both sides 
have joined the discussion. 
Over the weekend, we announced an 
agreement on principles for bipartisan 
legislation, 
20 
Senators—10 
Repub-
licans and 10 Democrats. This included 
a range of targeted reforms to keep our 
children and our communities safe, 
from mental health resources to fund-
ing to harden schools and make them 
more safe. No parent should have to 
send their child to school wondering 
whether they are going to be safe at 
school, and certainly no student should 
be afraid to go to school for fear of 
their safety. 
We also included a number of tar-
geted measures to prevent violence by 
people committing crimes and other 
dangerous individuals. I am proud of 
the work we have done so far, but, of 
course, we are not at the finish line. 
We are still at the beginning when it 
comes to drafting appropriate text. 
Our agreement is based on principles 
alone. And translating this proposal 
into legislative language is no easy 
task, as Members of the Senate under-
stand. Here is an example of the many 
details that need to be ironed out: One 
of the big pieces of this bill relates to 
State crisis intervention programs and 
initiatives. 
The idea here is pretty simple: Sup-
port programs that reduce violence, 
protect the public, and help individuals 
in crisis get the help they need. But 
there are a number of different ways 
this provision could be drafted, and I 
am committed to ensuring that we get 
it done right. 
But I want to be clear because there 
has been a lot of misinformation, mis-
understanding on this point. None of 
what we are proposing would create a 
national red flag law—no national red 
flag law. Some have mischaracterized 
this provision as an incentive for 
States to pass a red flag law, but that 
is something I am aiming to avoid. I 
trust the States to make their own de-
cisions, and 16 States have decided to 
pass red flag laws. But that is fewer 
than half of the States with red flag 
laws on the books. Congress should not 
only send Federal funding to those 
States but also other States that are 
doing things to deal with people in cri-
sis. And as the agreement, in principle, 
said, what we are focused on is crisis 
intervention. 
But there are a number of different 
ways that this could be approached. 
And I am fighting for this proposal to 
include a grant program that gives 
every State, regardless of whether it 
has a red flag law or not, funding to ad-
minister programs that they do have 
that will reduce violence, increase pub-
lic safety, and make sure that individ-
uals in crisis get the help that they 
need. 
There should be no requirement for 
States that do not currently have a red 
flag law to pass one. The existence or 
lack of a red flag law should not im-
pact on any States’ ability to receive 
funds for crisis intervention. And if a 
State does want to use this money to 
implement a red flag law, they should 
not be able to do so unless their red 
flag law contains a full set of due proc-
ess and Bill of Rights protections in 
the Constitution. 
So how can States without red flag 
laws use this money? Well, there are a 
range of evidence-based programs that 
support our shared goal, which is, in 
fact, to keep communities safe and to 
save lives. One great example is the as-
sisted outpatient treatment programs. 
These are sometimes just called AOTs. 
These programs allow courts to order 
people with serious mental illness to 
receive outpatient treatment as a con-
dition of living in the community. 
AOTs can be life changing for people 
who struggle to maintain consistent 
mental health treatment. 
Programs vary from State to State 
but typically include medication, along 
with a variety of other services includ-
ing counseling. AOTs rely on evidence- 
based treatment plans to help individ-
uals live healthier, safer lives, and they 
have a successful track record. As-
sisted outpatient treatment programs 
are effective in reducing arrests and in-
carceration, violent mental crises, and 
hospital stays and homelessness. I 
think this is another way that States 
without red flag laws might be able to 
use the funding that we would provide 
under the provisions of this bill. At 
least that is what I am hoping we ulti-
mately will land on. 
I think it would be kind of strange if 
we passed a national law that said only 
16 States were going to be eligible for 
this money and you would only be eli-
gible for it if you passed a red flag law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2925 
June 14, 2022 
I think that would almost be like try-
ing to commandeer the States’ legisla-
ture and government and force them to 
accept something they decided not to 
do but because maybe they tried to do 
something a little bit differently, like 
assisted outpatient treatment, mental 
health courts, which have been very 
successful in my State and veterans 
courts, in particular, to focus on our 
veterans community who has par-
ticular challenges. 
While I am talking about assisted 
outpatient treatment, 47 States actu-
ally have those laws, and I would like 
the money that would be available 
under this fund for crisis intervention 
to be able to be used for that. Again, I 
don’t support any prescriptive man-
dates or national mandates at all, in-
cluding a national red flag. Each State 
should be able to make their own 
choices and use its share of funding in 
the best way it sees fit to protect the 
constitutional rights of somebody who 
is in mental health crisis or to provide 
other resources, like assisted out-
patient treatment or mental health 
court adjudications or veterans courts 
hearings, in order to help them address 
their challenges. 
The great thing about the design of 
our country is that we have a national 
government, but we have sovereign 
States. Louis Brandeis once called 
them the laboratories of democracy. 
And, actually, it makes plenty of sense 
to me that we learned from the experi-
ence of the States that have passed red 
flag laws and States that have passed 
other types of ways to address people 
requiring crisis intervention. This pro-
vides the ability to innovate and to try 
new ideas and to come up with best 
practices that the Federal Government 
simply cannot do when you are consid-
ering legislating for a country of 330 
million people. 
So I personally do not support an 
overly prescriptive grant program that 
favors only a few States over all 50 
States. And, of course, I won’t support 
any grant program that violates the 
Constitution or the requirement of due 
process of law when it comes to a con-
stitutional 
right 
like 
the 
Second 
Amendment. 
So I do believe there are a range of 
options to improve public safety, and 
the States should have the funding and 
flexibility to invest in programs that 
they think best delivers the result—to 
save lives, to help people in crisis. And 
that is really what we are trying to do 
with this legislation. 
So the details are still being worked 
out. And we are drafting legislative 
text, and, of course, that is sometimes 
hard. Sometimes, I found that people 
use the same word, and they mean 
something different by it, or they come 
to it with a sort of context that maybe 
isn’t apparent from a conversation 
about principles. And that is why going 
from the principles that 20 of us have 
agreed on into legislative text that we 
can then vote on and pass is a chal-
lenge. 
We know that on a sensitive topic 
like this, a single word or the place-
ment of a comma can make the dif-
ference between protecting and infring-
ing on rights. So I am laser-focused on 
drafting text that reflects the common-
sense, targeted proposal that we have 
agreed to in principle. Again, we are 
working through the details, and I 
hope we will have legislative text later 
this week. But I am not willing to rush 
it for the sake of speed. 
I spoke with Senator SCHUMER, the 
majority leader, this morning, and he 
said he would like to have this bill 
ready to vote on next week. And I am 
certainly with him in terms of that as-
pirational goal. That means we are 
going to have to complete our work on 
the text by the end of this week so Sen-
ator SCHUMER will have that legisla-
tion available to take up next week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Sen-
ator CORNYN, for the work you are 
doing and working with Senator MUR-
PHY and so many other Senators. You 
and I have done so many bills together, 
including the historic Save Our Stages 
bill, which made such a difference. And 
I am very pleased that we are finally 
advancing gun safety legislation. And a 
lot of these provisions are things that 
we have been working across the aisle 
on for many years, the boyfriend loop-
hole—something that I introduced in 
2013, 10 years ago—to close the boy-
friend loophole. That is a part of this 
negotiation, part of the framework. We 
have so many women killed, 1 every 14 
hours, from domestic partners—1 every 
14 hours from domestic partners—with 
guns in this country. And, sadly, half 
of those involve dating partners, people 
who aren’t married to someone, but 
they are in a romantic relationship 
with them in some way. And the way 
the law works in all but 19 States 
where it is fully closed, in many of 
these States, you get convicted of do-
mestic abuse, and you can still go out 
and buy a gun the next day. 
So I am really pleased that we are 
moving forward on this provision. This 
isn’t the first time we have heard the 
call to action from America when it 
comes to guns. We heard it after 23 peo-
ple were killed at a Walmart in El 
Paso; after 17 people were killed at 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School in Parkland; after 59 people 
were killed at a country music festival, 
just out there on a beautiful evening 
enjoying the music; after 59 people 
dead in Las Vegas; and after 49 people 
were killed at the Pulse nightclub in 
Orlando. 
Today, we hear calls for action be-
cause of more tragedies: a White su-
premacist murdering 10 people who are 
simply shopping for groceries; one guy 
out buying a cake for his little boy, a 
birthday cake for his son, who never 
returned; 10 people killed. 
The American people are demanding 
that we do something after the sense-
less murder of 19 children and 2 teach-
ers who died putting their very lives up 
to protect those children in Uvalde, 
TX. We have seen the pictures of those 
kids in their confirmation-communion 
dresses, in their sports uniforms, the 
Converse green sneakers, the glasses, 
the smiles. In some photos, they were 
actually holding awards they had won 
just that morning. 
But today, after too many of these 
tragedies to name, I rise with renewed 
hope that we are finally working to-
gether to help keep Americans safe 
from gun violence. While there is so 
much more work to be done, reforms 
outlined in the bipartisan framework, 
like encouraging States to enact risk 
protection 
orders, 
which 
are 
also 
known as red flag laws, expanding ac-
cess to mental health services, and sup-
porting school violence prevention— 
Senator GRASSLEY and I led that bill 
after Parkland that we passed with sig-
nificant funding for schools. Clearly, 
more must be done. 
As I noted, I am particularly pleased 
to see that the framework will include 
my bill to finally close the boyfriend 
loophole. Every year, more than 600 
American women are shot to death by 
intimate partners. We understandably 
focus on the horror of these mass 
shootings, but think of those numbers: 
600 women shot every year by intimate 
partners. 
We know that preventing convicted 
domestic abusers from getting guns 
saves lives. We know that because we 
have seen the numbers in the States 
that have the laws in place. 
Currently, Federal law only prohibits 
domestic abusers from buying a gun if 
they are currently or formerly mar-
ried—think about that: currently or 
formerly married—or if they have ever 
lived together or if they have a child. 
That is despite the fact, as I noted, 
that half of these homicides—half of 
the women killed are killed by dating 
partners. That is why in 2013 I intro-
duced this bill to close this dangerous 
loophole, and now, I am so pleased that 
there is growing bipartisan support for 
the bill. 
By the way, we have shown that sup-
port in the past. It was part of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act that passed 
in the House, and it had 29 Republicans 
vote for it. That included an even more 
broad version of the bill, which also in-
cluded stalking and was broader than 
what we are going to see in this bill. 
Obviously, I support my original bill, 
but the fact that we are making 
progress to close the loophole in the 
States that so far have not gotten to 
where the other 19 are is incredibly 
positive. It did not pass last time when 
we passed the Violence Against Women 
Act in the Senate. Sadly, it didn’t 
make it in there. But, again, it got 29 
Republican votes in the House, and 
that just shows the kind of growing 
momentum we have for this. 
I come from a State with a proud tra-
dition of hunting and fishing, like 
yours. I always think about my Uncle

June 14, 2022 
Dick and his deer stand, and I always 
ask, when I look at these proposals— 
from closing the boyfriend loophole to 
putting in better background checks, 
to doing something about better check-
ing the records of 18- to 21 year olds— 
I think, does that hurt my Uncle Dick 
and his deer stand? Of course, the an-
swer is, it does not. 
This is our moment to act. It is not 
just one killing, and we all know that. 
It has happened in every single commu-
nity. Every single Senator in this 
Chamber knows of a moment where 
they thought ‘‘How could this happen 
in my community?’’ when they meet 
with a family. 
What I remember the most, actually, 
is a case involving a police officer out 
of Lake City, MN. He was a good cop 
doing his job. He was called to a domes-
tic violence incident. 
What people don’t often know is that 
for police officers, these domestic vio-
lence calls can be some of the most 
dangerous because you have someone 
who is very angry, and you don’t know 
what you are walking into. It is in the 
moment. 
He gets there to the door. He has his 
bulletproof vest on, but the perpe-
trator—clearly mentally ill—who had 
been beating up his young, young, 
young girlfriend, meets him with a 
gun, shoots him in his head, and he 
dies. 
I was there for that funeral. There 
was an outpouring of support from the 
community. The funeral was held in 
the very same church where the officer 
and his wife and their three little kids 
had gathered for the nativity play just 
a few weeks before for Christmas, those 
two little boys and a little girl. The fa-
ther had sat in the front row to watch 
his boys in that nativity play only a 
few weeks before, and the next time 
the family is in that church, it is the 
widow, the two little boys, and this lit-
tle tiny girl in a dress with blue stars 
on it walking down the aisle of that 
church at his funeral. That is a mo-
ment I won’t forget. 
I just shows you how domestic abuse 
and those kinds of cases—yes, there is 
one immediate victim—most likely the 
woman—but it is a whole family who is 
the victim. Kids who witness domestic 
abuse through their lives are so much 
more likely to get into crime them-
selves. Statistics have shown it. But it 
is even more than the family, it is the 
whole community, as that family who 
lost their dad and lost their husband 
would tell you if they were standing in 
here right now. 
So I am so pleased we are finally 
moving on this. I thank Senator MUR-
PHY. I thank Senator CORNYN and all 
those involved. I am also so grateful 
that my 10 years of work leading this 
bill with Representative DEBBIE DIN-
GELL in the House has not gone for 
naught. We kept it moving. It is prob-
ably a sign for anyone that persever-
ance matters in this place. I am very 
pleased that it is part of the final nego-
tiations, and it will make such a dif-
ference for saving lives. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING OUR PROMISE TO AD-
DRESS COMPREHENSIVE TOXICS 
ACT OF 2021—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
TRIBUTE TO TED LEHMAN 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to sadly an-
nounce the retirement—or not retire-
ment—my chief of staff’s decision to 
move on to another great opportunity, 
and I wanted to take a few minutes to 
talk about Ted Lehman and not only 
the 5 years he has been my chief of 
staff but the nearly 20 years he has 
been working in the Senate. 
Before I start, though, he attended 
the University of Pennsylvania, where 
he got his undergrad, and then he went 
to Georgetown to get his law degree. 
He clerked for Thomas Hogan, who was 
then the chief judge of the DC District 
Court. 
He came to the Senate about 20 years 
ago, in 2002. To give you some perspec-
tive, I didn’t enter the legislature in 
North Carolina until 2007, so he has 
years of experience on me. He has 
knowledge of the Senate that I will 
never gain. 
He started work with Senator Hatch. 
He worked for a couple of years with 
Senator Sessions, and then he worked 
for Senator GRASSLEY on the Judiciary 
Committee. He was the chief counsel of 
nominations and senior counsel for the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, and that 
is where I met Ted. 
I remember vividly, when my chief of 
staff at the time, Ray Starling, told me 
that he was going to be moving back to 
North Carolina, I told him: Great. Now 
find your replacement. 
It was later that day that he came to 
me and said: What about Ted Lehman? 
I said: I think that is a fantastic 
idea. 
Ted wasn’t looking for a job, and I 
wondered whether or not he would be 
interested in working for a freshman 
Senator from the State of North Caro-
lina. But he took that job, and he has 
done extraordinary work, not only in 
terms of the day-to-day institutional 
grind that a chief has to go through 
but his attention to staff—not only the 
DC staff but the North Carolina staff. I 
think he is well-regarded among the 
staff, and he is going to be sorely 
missed. 
I also need to talk about Ted and his 
family. To say that it is in the Lehman 
blood is an understatement. His broth-
er Dirksen served on the HELP Com-
mittee 
with 
Senator 
Jeffords. 
His 
brother Patrick is the legislative direc-
tor to Senator SASSE. He knows a lot 
about this institution, and he knows a 
lot about its processes. The first, real-
ly, opportunity I got to see that in ac-
tion was when he was responsible for 
moving Justice Gorsuch through the 
nominations process. 
Ted has a great family—his wife 
Amy, his son Jackson, his oldest son, 
his oldest daughter, Emma Claire, 
Sallye, and a young son now. Now, Ted 
is not from North Carolina, and we 
have speculated as to why he named 
his son what he did. He may say it is 
related to some sort of family tradi-
tion, but I think it is no coincidence 
that he named his son ‘‘Raleigh’’ after 
our State’s capitol. 
Ted is an avid hunter, fisher, out-
doorsman, baseball dad, soccer dad—all 
those sorts of things—and he gets the 
right balance. He understands that 
family is as important as work, and he 
figures out how to strike that balance. 
But there is very seldom a morning 
where he is not one of the first people 
in, and there are so many nights where 
I am the last person he sees before he 
goes home. 
I appreciate his service. I am going to 
miss him. 
Thank you, Ted. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
H.R. 3967 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
today in support of the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our 
Promises to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act, also known as the Hon-
oring our PACT Act. 
Our Nation asks a great deal of our 
servicemembers and their families. We 
ask them to be ready to fight and to 
win against a wide range of security 
challenges across the globe. Our Armed 
Forces 
know 
and 
understand 
the 
threats they may face on the battle-
field. Unfortunately, servicemembers 
also face threats that aren’t as appar-
ent—exposure to toxic materials. These 
exposures can result in rare and some-
times fatal medical conditions. 
From exposure to Agent Orange to 
radiation from nuclear tests, veterans 
have carried an extra burden because of 
their service. It has too often been a 
struggle to recognize and address those 
impacts. 
Now, a new generation is dealing 
with the long-term effects of toxic ex-
posure. Indeed, during their service, up 
to 31⁄2 million veterans have been ex-
posed to toxic burn pits. As the name 
implies, burn pits are pits where all 
forms of waste, including toxic waste, 
are disposed of by burning. Our service-
members lived and worked in close 
proximity to these burn pits, often 
without knowing the potential con-
sequences to their long-term health or 
any way to avoid it. 
Since 2009, the Department of De-
fense has recognized the harm burn

pits 
can 
cause. 
The 
health 
con-
sequences are so serious that in the fis-
cal year 2022 National Defense Author-
ization Act, within that legislation, we 
included a provision that says that the 
only way the Department of Defense 
can now use a burn pit overseas is if 
the Secretary of Defense personally 
issues a waiver. It is an authority that 
cannot be delegated to anyone else in 
the Department. 
The bill we have before us today 
would really honor our obligation to 
care for other veterans by acknowl-
edging the injuries and illnesses they 
sustain in serving our country and pro-
viding them with treatment. 
The bill would expand eligibility for 
VA healthcare for the 31⁄2 million vet-
erans who were exposed to burn pits. It 
would also eliminate the burden of 
proof for veterans for 23 conditions pre-
sumed to be caused by toxic exposure. 
It will create a new framework for the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to evalu-
ate the science around burn pits and 
establish other presumptive conditions 
associated with toxic exposure. It will 
also provide significant resources for 
the VA to carry out the expansion of 
benefits in this bill, including provi-
sions on staffing, retention, pay, and 
leasing of new VA facilities. 
Every generation of Americans has 
had men and women who were willing 
to serve our country in uniform. As 
chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, I have had the honor of trav-
eling across the globe to meet with our 
deployed 
servicemembers, 
including 
numerous trips to Afghanistan and 
Iraq. 
Our servicemembers and our veterans 
truly represent what is best in our 
country. We honor and venerate their 
heroism in combat, but too often in the 
past, we have overlooked and dismissed 
the long-term health effects of their 
service. 
This is changing. 
With this bill, we will do the right 
thing for our toxic-exposed and combat 
veterans and their families. We can en-
sure that they have access to the care 
and services they deserve and have 
earned. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join 
me in supporting this important piece 
of legislation. 
Before I yield the floor, I must recog-
nize the extraordinary work of Senator 
JON TESTER and Senator JERRY MORAN, 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee. This was 
an extraordinary effort. It was bipar-
tisan. It was motivated by the recogni-
tion on both sides of the aisle of the 
service and sacrifice of thousands and 
thousands of men and women. But we 
would not be here today without the 
undaunted and unflagging dedication of 
JON TESTER and JERRY. I salute both of 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO C. CLYDE JONES 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, this 
afternoon, I want to recognize a long-
time Manhattan, KS—known as the 
Little Apple—a Manhattan, KS, public 
servant, C. Clyde Jones, on his 100th 
birthday. 
Before building his life in Manhattan, 
he grew up in West Virginia and then 
swore an oath to our Nation in 1943 to 
serve our country in the U.S. Navy dur-
ing World World II. 
Following his service, he returned to 
focus on his education, earning a bach-
elor’s, master’s, and doctorate con-
centrated on social science and history. 
After serving several universities in 
the South and Midwest, he received a 
phone call to come interview at Kansas 
State University. And while his initial 
reaction to living in the Sunflower 
State was less than thrilled, Kansans 
easily won him over when he visited. 
The beauty of the Flint Hills, where K- 
State is located, also didn’t hurt. That 
was 60 years ago, and in that time, 
Clyde has left a tremendous impact 
both on Kansas State and the larger 
Manhattan community. 
He was hired to head the business de-
partment within the College of Arts 
and Sciences; but with his leadership, 
it resulted in the transformation of the 
department into an accredited college. 
In 1962, he opened the Kansas State 
University College of Business as its 
first dean. 
His involvement in campus life was 
all-encompassing, also serving as chair 
of the athletic council as it spear-
headed the construction of the current 
football stadium, now known as Bill 
Snyder Family Stadium. It continues 
to welcome thousands of Wildcats to 
each Saturday’s home game through-
out the fall season. 
His reach extended beyond campus as 
he invested in the larger community, 
serving on various community boards, 
including the United Way. He also 
worked as president of the Manhattan 
Area Chamber of Commerce. In 2001, 
the annual Chamber Volunteer of the 
Year award was renamed in his honor. 
Clyde has also become a staunch ad-
vocate for Shepherd’s Crossing, a local 
ministry focused on providing caring 
assistance to those in need of financial 
support. Over the 20 years since its 
founding, Clyde has held every position 
within the Shepherd’s Crossing organi-
zation. Even today, he holds the title 
of chief development officer; and in 
this role, he has increased donations to 
support the work they are doing by 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Clyde’s love and dedication to Man-
hattan has been demonstrated in ev-
erything he has done for over 60 years. 
Our community has been made better 
and stronger because of his countless 
hours of service. 
Clyde, thank you for being an exam-
ple of a solid, true, and faithful public 
servant. You are what I have in mind 
when I say we need more civics and less 
politics in our community, State, and 
Nation. I wish you the happiest of 
birthdays and hope that you can ring 
in 100 years surrounded by the ones you 
love. Know that there are many of us 
who love you. 
Happy birthday, Clyde. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3986 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
this past Saturday, I got to spend the 
whole morning with the East Central 
Kansas Model T Club back home. I even 
got to take a joy ride in a 1921 Model T. 
Among many stories, I learned Ameri-
cans were paying only 21 cents a gallon 
when this car was made. And it wasn’t 
until 1975, 54 years later, that gas had 
doubled from that price, jumping from 
39 to 53 cents—54 years it took to dou-
ble. 
I don’t have to remind anyone that, 
thanks to our President’s energy poli-
cies and his reckless spending, he ac-
complished a doubling in less than 2 
years. As we all know, gas is now over 
$5 a gallon, if you can believe it or not. 
We are seeing record prices that have 
gone now 16 days in a row without a 
single downtick. 
And this is why I am here today to 
ask for unanimous consent to pass the 
Gas Prices Relief Act, which would bar 
any Federal agency from finalizing any 
rule or regulation that would make it 
harder to produce American fuels. 
My legislation would send the right 
signal to American producers and in-
vestors. It would show them that the 
Congress sees the problem and that we 
are ready to address it. It would set us 
on a course to bring down prices at the 
pump, not with more reckless spending 
and more regulations, but by getting 
out of the way of American production 
and allowing them to power the world 
without more needlessly restrictive 
rules. 
With this more than doubling of 
price, many families back home are 
telling me they are paying $50, up to 
$100 a week more for gasoline. And that 
is $2- to $400 a month, in case you are 
adding it up. And on top of that, their 
monthly utility bills have doubled. 
I am sure this administration will 
propose more reckless spending to fix 
that 
problem, 
too. 
Unfortunately, 
Biden-flation is impacting many Kan-
sas families to the tune of $6- to $700 a 
month. That is over $7,000 a year. 
Now, why the increase, you might 
ask. Now, I am not an economist, but it 
looks to me like if you increase the 
regulations on a process, on a business, 
that is a surefire way to decrease the

supply. And as we all know, our Presi-
dent and his policies are ramping up 
regulations at every step of the Amer-
ican oil and gas business, all the while 
begging for help from other nations. In-
deed, he is fulfilling his campaign 
promises to destroy American oil and 
gas. 
Now, one more thought. As history 
teaches us, along with reckless spend-
ing, energy is always a leading indi-
cator of inflation. If we don’t get our 
arms around this energy crisis and 
reckless spending, we will never slow 
down inflation. But it appears our 
President and his party disagree with 
this, or else, simply stated, they don’t 
care. Or maybe they want these high 
prices. It just seems like yesterday I 
was filling my truck up back home for 
less than $2 a gallon, and now, again, it 
is over $5 a gallon across most of the 
Nation. 
Rising energy prices add inflationary 
pressure to everything. It is like a 
game of dominoes. When the diesel fuel 
powering our 18-wheelers are costing 
truckers 80 percent more than it did 
last year, they are going to have to 
pass on that rate to their consumers. 
When businesses are paying 30 percent 
more for their gas utilities, they are 
going to have to raise their prices to 
make up the difference. And Kansans, 
already paying more just to get to the 
store, are continually finding that 
what money they have left is getting 
them less and less every week. 
You don’t fix a supply-and-demand 
problem of this nature with price con-
trols or artificial subsidies or more 
reckless spending. In reality, this is 
not very complicated. You could fix it 
by decreasing demand or increasing 
supply. Now, demand, unfortunately, is 
not decreasing, which is why we need 
this regulatory holiday in order to set 
American energy free. 
On some level, the administration 
knows this and, hence, their knee-jerk 
decision to release a million barrels of 
oil from our Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve every day, reportedly without 
initially coordinating in a meaningful 
way with our partners overseas. Obvi-
ously, 1 million barrels a day won’t cut 
it. In 2021, the United States consumed 
roughly nearly 20 million barrels a day. 
This release is truly a drop in the 
bucket. 
The administration knows that the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases 
are purely cosmetic, to try to convince 
the American people that they have so-
lutions while they run off to beg for-
eign dictators and terrorists to produce 
more oil. Instead of looking within, in-
stead of creating more Americans jobs, 
high-paying jobs, producing the clean-
est fuel in the world, they continue 
their full frontal assault on American 
production and seek to enrich our en-
emies, like Venezuela and Iran. 
But there has been a lot of talk on 
the left that they are not interfering 
with oil and gas production in the 
United States. These claims are simply 
untrue. On the campaign trail, Presi-
dent Biden promised to end the leasing 
of oil and gas production on Federal 
lands, and his climate czar recently 
said the administration ‘‘remains abso-
lutely committed to not moving for-
ward with additional drilling on public 
lands.’’ Most Presidents brag when 
they fulfill a campaign promise but ap-
parently not when the results are this 
bad. 
It is hard to imagine that this is not 
all by design. This administration is 
getting exactly what they want. In the 
President’s own words, the world is 
currently going through an ‘‘incredible 
transition,’’ and he thinks we will ‘‘be 
stronger and the world will be stronger 
and less reliant on fossil fuels when 
this is over.’’ 
Well, the obvious question then is 
this: When—when will it be over? The 
Department of Energy has estimated 
that demand for oil and gas will in-
crease through 2050. That is a simple 
fact. Yet we have a President who is 
perfectly willing to inflict pain on the 
people who elected him to force his cli-
mate policies—his costly climate poli-
cies—and ignore the economic reality 
that the American people are facing. 
Now, why else would he propose a 
budget that gets rid of key tax provi-
sions for the oil and gas industry? Why 
else would he promote policies that 
will make it more difficult and more 
expensive to drill? Does anyone think 
these policies are going to help the 
American people? 
Let’s talk about the stream of bad 
policies causing the crippling uncer-
tainty that is making American pro-
ducers hesitant to increase drilling. 
Last November, the EPA started the 
process of updating methane regula-
tions. While the proposed rule they put 
forward was criminally devoid of any 
details, their intent was clear: an in-
crease in costly regulations that will 
harm the oil and national gas industry, 
run small businesses out of business, 
and further increase energy costs. 
On February 18, by a completely par-
tisan vote, FERC issued and made im-
mediately effective two new policy 
statements that would have had disas-
trous implications for pipeline develop-
ment in the U.S., pipelines critical to 
getting that oil to American con-
sumers. Their off-the-deep-end proposal 
would have potentially put pipeline op-
erators on the hook for mitigating the 
emissions of the end user of the prod-
uct they transport. In other words, to 
get approval to build a pipeline, opera-
tors could have been forced to develop 
and pay for a way to mitigate the emis-
sions caused by Americans driving to 
work every day or perhaps by Ameri-
cans heating their homes or cooking 
their breakfast. Thankfully, in the face 
of fierce outcry from opponents on 
both sides of the aisle, they have tem-
porarily pulled these changes back for 
further consideration. Though, that 
likely has more to do with the upcom-
ing nomination process—the renomina-
tion 
process—for 
FERC 
Chairman 
Glick than it does with good energy 
policy. 
On March 21, the SEC followed suit 
and proposed a rule that would require 
companies to disclose climate emission 
data, including greenhouse emissions, 
caused by their suppliers and their cus-
tomers. This would require companies 
to calculate and disclose the emissions 
for how everyday Americans use their 
products, all in an effort to make doing 
business with American oil and gas 
producers seem even more risky and 
less deserving of financing. 
And, finally, an issue that is at the 
top of mind of many producers in Kan-
sas right now, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service is poised to list the lesser prai-
rie-chicken as a threatened species. 
This is despite the incredible work 
being done by conservationists that 
have made the lesser prairie-chicken 
better protected now than ever. If the 
Fish and Wildlife Service goes through 
with this classification, it would have 
serious consequences for oil and gas 
producers in Kansas and severely limit 
their ability to increase production, 
not to mention the impact it will have 
on our utilities. 
Once again, let me state, these rea-
sons and more are why I am here today 
to ask unanimous consent to pass the 
Gas Prices Relief Act, which would bar 
any Federal agency from finalizing any 
rule regulation that would make it 
harder to produce American fuels. Our 
legislation would send the right signal 
to American producers and investors. 
It would show them that Congress sees 
the problem and that we are ready to 
address it. It would set us on course to 
bring down prices at the pump by get-
ting out of the way and releasing 
American 
production 
and 
allowing 
them to power the world without more 
needlessly restrictive rules and regula-
tions. Good energy policy will fix the 
current crisis, not more reckless spend-
ing. 
Before I yield, I would like to turn 
the floor over to the Senator from 
Montana for his thoughts on the record 
gas prices we are facing and the need to 
pass our Gas Price Relief Act. 
Mr. DAINES. I want to thank the 
Senator from Kansas for his work on 
this bill. 
Madam President, the price at the 
pump has skyrocketed. Let’s do a 
quick trip down memory lane. When 
President Biden was inaugurated, the 
weekly average price for gas was about 
$2.30 a gallon. In fact, when we intro-
duced the bill that we are trying to 
pass today, the Gas Price Relief Act, 
that was on March 31 of this year, the 
weekly average was $4.02 a gallon. The 
weekly average today is $4.84. In fact, 
other studies show it is now at $5 and 
climbing. We think these numbers will 
keep going up. Most analysts agree. We 
may be facing $6-a-gallon gas by this 
summer. 
I filled up my pickup in Belgrade, 
MT, Friday night. My wife and I pulled 
into a gas station. And when the tank 
was full, the price tag was $138. 
The pain at the pump that Montana 
families are feeling today is because of

the Democrats’ anti-American energy 
policies. 
When President Biden killed the Key-
stone Pipeline 6 hours after being 
sworn in—by the way, that had tremen-
dous benefits for the State of Montana. 
They help our impoverished Eastern 
Montana counties with tax revenues, 
not to mention providing nearly a mil-
lion barrels of oil a day for the United 
States. By stopping and eliminating oil 
and gas leases, removing essential re-
lief for small refiners, and then build-
ing an administration of, frankly, some 
far-left anti—anti—oil and natural gas 
ideologues, this administration has 
gone above and beyond to hinder tradi-
tional American energy development. 
And what is the solution that we are 
hearing from President Biden? Turn to 
foreign dictators for more oil, tap into 
our oil reserves, beg OPEC to increase 
production, and perhaps the most out- 
of-touch solution I have heard, simply 
suggest families buy electric vehicles. I 
can tell you that won’t work in a State 
like Montana. 
The real solution is to unleash Amer-
ican energy and encourage American 
energy investment. This bill I have 
with Senator MARSHALL is simple. It 
prevents 
the 
Biden 
administration 
from imposing any new rules or regula-
tions that would decrease oil, gas, or 
renewable 
fuel 
production, 
which 
would, therefore, increase gas prices of 
hard-working Montanans. 
I am urging my colleagues across the 
aisle to think about hard-working fam-
ilies across this country, how are they 
trying to make ends meet, to think 
about their constituents who depend on 
affordable gas prices to get to work or 
drop kids off at school. 
I am urging my colleagues across the 
aisle who say they support American 
energy development, and they want to 
lower gas costs, to support this bill. 
We need to pass this bill for Amer-
ican families. 
I yield back my time to the Senator 
from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
would like to ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 3986 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. 
I further ask that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have been lis-
tening with interest to my two distin-
guished colleagues discuss this meas-
ure, referring to it repeatedly as ‘‘gov-
erning 
American 
energy.’’ 
But, 
of 
course, what it really governs is fossil 
fuel energy. That is the intention here, 
and that is the result. 
Let’s start with a basic factual prop-
osition, which is that the price of oil is 
set by oil companies. 
In a market economy, the producer 
of a product chooses the price. And 
what has happened in this instance is 
that the oil industry has chosen to de-
part from market economics, to depart 
from the costs that were the same just 
a few years ago, and instead to follow 
upward the international cartel that 
our oil industry is a part of. 
This international cartel has driven 
world oil prices extremely high. And 
American oil companies have chosen— 
have chosen—to follow that price, raise 
the prices at the pump, punish Amer-
ican drivers, in order to blow out their 
profits. 
We know that this is true because 
the companies themselves are report-
ing 
unprecedented 
profits—massive 
profits. We know they are not tracking 
the cost of production at a reasonable 
profit because their profits have soared 
as they have chosen—chosen—to pur-
sue this international cartel price and 
punish American drivers. It is their 
choice. 
And then they have the colossal 
nerve to take their choice, what they 
have done to American drivers, and 
then start using that for leverage to 
try to get other fossil fuel industry 
prerogatives accomplished politically. 
And let me say, don’t be mad at the 
gas station owner. The gas station 
owner is not the one who is jacking up 
the prices. For a lot of gas station own-
ers, they don’t even make money on 
the gas. You have got to go in and buy 
a coffee or snacks to have them make 
money. 
Your local gas station is not the 
problem with these prices. The problem 
is Chevron, Exxon, Marathon, all of the 
big oil companies that have chosen to 
drive gas prices through the roof so 
they can fill their pockets with profit, 
so they can prepare for the fact that 
their product has got an end point. 
We can’t keep polluting the Earth 
the way we are with the emissions of 
fossil fuel. I noticed that neither of my 
colleagues mentioned that this fossil 
fuel actually gets burned. We don’t eat 
it; we burn it. And when we burn it, it 
emits CO2 and other gases, and we are 
seeing the effect of that all over the 
planet. 
Pollution increases. CO2 levels con-
tinue to increase. We constantly set 
new records for CO2 levels in the at-
mosphere. Heat increases. We are heat-
ing the ocean so fast—there is a new 
term that we have, a new term of 
measurement, a ‘‘zettajoule.’’ Do you 
know what a zettajoule is? A joule is a 
unit of heat energy measurement. A 
zettajoule is that unit with 21 zeros 
after it. It is an enormous number. All 
of the fossil fuel burned by all of the 
people 
across 
this 
entire 
planet 
amounts 
to 
less 
than 
half 
of 
a 
zettajoule of energy—all of it, less than 
half. 
And for the price of that—because of 
the emissions, because of the pollution, 
because of the CO2, because of the 
methane—we are heating up the planet 
so fast that every year 14 zettajoules of 
excess heat go into the ocean, where 
my fishermen in Rhode Island see their 
catches 
disappear, 
see 
their 
lives 
turned upside down, see fisheries that 
their fathers and their grandfathers 
fished completely upturned. 
This comes home in Rhode Island. 
Our Coastal Resources Management 
Council predicts that all that ocean 
warming is going to raise sea levels so 
that in my lifetime we are going to 
start to see flooding. Things that are 
now part of our State are going to be-
come islands. Warwick Neck becomes 
Warwick Neck Island. Bristol becomes 
Bristol Island. Poppasquash Point be-
comes Poppasquash Island. Newport di-
vides into a mainland and an island. 
We become the Rhode Island archi-
pelago. We lose enormous amounts of 
our shoreline to sea level rise. Never 
mention—never mention that harm. So 
when you come here and say, we want 
to help more fossil fuel get burned, re-
member that on the other end of that 
are places like Rhode Island. 
And if we want to have a conversa-
tion about how we solve price now and 
how we protect against emissions later, 
that is a conversation I am more than 
willing to have. But a one-sided con-
versation that is only about more 
burning, more pollution, more emis-
sions, more of that for Rhode Island, I 
don’t think so. 
And it is not, of course, just Rhode 
Island. Other States are having unprec-
edented wildfires. They are having un-
precedented droughts. We are seeing a 
planet whose basic operating systems 
are being changed by fossil fuel emis-
sions. And until we grapple with that 
seriously, you can bet I will object— 
which I do. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4217 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I would actually ask, in response, 
that we pass a different measure, and I 
would ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 4217, and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MARSHALL. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
think we should start calling electric 
cars coal-powered cars. We should start 
thinking about a cradle-to-grave envi-
ronmental impact to some of the alter-
natives, but I want to reassure to my 
colleague, the folks on the other side of 
the aisle, that I want to leave this 
world cleaner, healthier, and safer than 
we found it. 
But on the other hand, we can’t cre-
ate such high inflation with reckless

spending and energy policies that stifle 
American energy. I do believe that 
there is a balance. I do believe that 
there are opportunities, but we can’t 
go from zero to 90 miles an hour over-
night, nor can we throw the brakes on 
our current energy supply. 
I grew up in the oil patch. I lived in 
the oil patch. The prices of oil are 
being driven up by the uncertainty cre-
ated by this administration. Make no 
mistake about it, the price of oil is 
people who are thinking about invest-
ing, what will they get 2 years from 
now? It would take 2 years probably to 
see any type of return on investment 
from an oilfield exploration. 
But this President and his policies, 
his regulations continue to create un-
certainty and drive the price up for all 
Americans. 
Just the thought of $5-a-gallon gaso-
line makes my heart shiver. The people 
I talk to back home, there is no con-
versation I am going to have without 
someone bringing up the price of gaso-
line right now. 
And I am so proud that we are taking 
traditional energies, and we are mak-
ing them cleaner; that we are using 
biofuels to help decrease the tailpipe 
emissions through E15 year round and 
higher ethanol as well. I am proud of 
the biodiesel that we are using as well. 
I think that there are incredible op-
portunities out there, but inflation, 
reckless spending inflation, driving up 
the price of gasoline very purposefully 
is what this President has accom-
plished, and it is hurting people back 
home. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My colleague 
may care to object. 
Mr. MARSHALL. So I object to Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Or at least to the 
motion I propounded anyway. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Yes, I specifically 
object to the motion. My apologies. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, of course, as well, but I think 
the intention was to object to the 
measure. 
I see that my friend Senator BAR-
RASSO has joined us. I had mentioned 
zettajoules. I want to add one other fig-
ure. This is from a report by the cor-
porate accounting and consulting firm, 
Deloitte Consulting, which has said 
that if we don’t get ahead of this cli-
mate problem that my colleague seems 
so scrupulously interested in ignoring, 
the cost to society in the next five dec-
ades will be, if I remember correctly— 
the number is $178 trillion in economic 
harm across those years. 
You want to talk about big numbers? 
And if we do get it right, if we grow up, 
treat this as a factual scientific prob-
lem and put in serious, real economic 
solutions, then the win side is $43 tril-
lion. 
So the swing is $220 trillion. You 
want to talk about big numbers? That 
is a big number. And it is going to de-
pend on decisions we make now, and I 
hope we start making good decisions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor as I see my col-
leagues debating issues related to en-
ergy, and I come to the floor to also de-
bate and discuss the issue of energy 
and, specifically, the need of the Amer-
ican people for more energy. 
Because right now, America, in terms 
of energy, is running on empty. Gas 
prices have broken records day after 
day after day over the last several 
months. Inflation increased again last 
month to a new record 40-year high. 
Just this morning, we found out that 
inflation from producers is even higher 
than inflation for consumers. Whole-
sale prices are up by nearly 11 percent 
in the last year. 
That means higher prices for people 
who grow our food, who build our 
buildings, and who work so hard to 
keep the lights on. 
Inflation for producers means infla-
tion for consumers tomorrow. After 13 
months of this inflation crisis, there is 
still no light at the end of the tunnel. 
The average price of gasoline across 
the United States today is over $5 a 
gallon. 
That is a big number. We just heard 
colleagues 
discussing 
big 
numbers. 
Five dollars a gallon is a big number 
for anyone who is driving a gas-pow-
ered car or a diesel-powered car or 
truck in America. 
Gas prices are at an alltime high in 
all 50 States, and there is no end in 
sight. Experts tell us that the price of 
gas is going to continue to go higher. 
We may actually see $6 a gallon this 
summer across the country, and today, 
gas is already $6 a gallon in a number 
of locations. 
Now, for most Americans, this is un-
thinkable. So what are families doing? 
Well, they are kind of buckling up for 
what may be a summer of financial suf-
fering for the American people. For 
many, it means a summer of staying 
home. People are having to change the 
way they drive, the way they eat, the 
way they live. Family vacations are 
being canceled left and right. People 
are cutting back on shopping to the 
point that retail jobs disappeared last 
month, thousands and thousands of re-
tail jobs. 
Coronavirus caused one lockdown. 
Now 
we 
are 
headed 
into 
a 
new 
lockdown because people don’t have 
the money to get out—get out to go to 
dinner, get out to go to a movie, get 
out to go on vacation. People are stay-
ing home because they can’t afford to 
do anything else. 
Many working families are being 
pushed to the breaking point. Savings 
have melted away. Household debt is 
now at a record high. More and more 
people are having to borrow money just 
to get through the end of the month. 
The purchasing power of the American 
people keeps going lower and lower and 
lower. That is providing very little re-
lief—even for people who are getting 
raises, they are having a hard time 
keeping up and feel they are falling 
further behind. 
Home energy costs are up and will 
continue to go up this summer. We 
hear that our energy grid is vulnerable 
for blackouts this summer. Democrats 
have been in power for over 17 months. 
They continue to do nothing to help 
the American people with this Biden- 
caused energy crisis. 
Now, Joe Biden’s Cabinet has been on 
tour, talking and trying to mislead the 
American people about the energy cri-
sis. We saw Pete Buttigieg and Gina 
Raimondo. They said that Joe Biden is 
just an innocent bystander, just stand-
ing there, watching the world go by. 
Nothing he could do about it. 
The Commerce Secretary last week 
said—and this was on a national news 
show—she said there isn’t much that 
can be done to produce more energy. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said 
Joe Biden has ‘‘done everything he can 
to bring down energy prices.’’ Every-
thing he can? This is a blatant, bold-
faced lie to the American people. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
caused this American energy crisis. Joe 
Biden seemed to brag about it at first 
when, on his first day in office, he 
killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, kill-
ing 800,000 barrels of oil a day to the 
United States—more than we would 
have ever gotten from Putin. Joe Biden 
bragged about it, proud of himself. 
Stopped those oil and gas leases as 
well. What the President has done with 
the oil and gas leases was blatantly il-
legal and brutally punished working 
families in my home State of Wyo-
ming. 
You know, after 16 months in office, 
President Obama had held 44 oil and 
gas lease sales. Joe Biden? Not a single 
one. 
If the Senator from Alaska were 
here, she would say that Joe Biden 
shut down oil and gas production in the 
Arctic. For leases that were out there, 
drilling applications, thousands and 
thousands are in limbo because the ad-
ministration just wants them to sit 
there. 
Now Joe Biden is furthering his at-
tack on American energy. He is not 
just blocking new leases, he is even 
going after thousands of existing leases 
that were sold during previous admin-
istrations, the Obama and the Trump 
administrations. 
After just 16 months in office—and 
the American people know this; I am 
not making any news here—Joe Biden 
is already the most anti-American en-
ergy President in American history. He 
has kept our energy production on 
lockdown, he has kept workers on the 
sideline, and he has kept energy buried 
in the ground. As a result, today, we 
are still producing 1 million fewer bar-
rels of oil today and every single day 
than we were producing in America be-
fore the pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2931 
June 14, 2022 
So, despite what the administration 
claims, Joe Biden could do things right 
now to actually produce more energy. 
First, instead of blocking all Federal 
land, he needs to hold Federal oil and 
gas lease sales. He should approve the 
4,300 drilling applications that he is 
holding in limbo. Finally, instead of 
shutting down pipelines, he should ap-
prove more pipelines so we can trans-
mit energy. He should speed up the 
pipeline approval process. Right now, it 
takes a lot longer to get approval to 
build a pipeline than it does to actually 
build a pipeline. But Joe Biden refuses 
to change his policies. That is why I 
say that Joe Biden actually wants high 
gas prices. 
Democrats keep bragging about the 
so-called incredible transition. It is a 
transition that is strangling the Amer-
ican people. Joe Biden went on a late- 
night comedy show last week. He was 
asked about climate change. He said 
right now ‘‘there’s an opportunity to 
move more rapidly . . . to alternative 
energy.’’ He seems to think everything 
is going according to plan. 
The climate elitists want prices so 
high that people can’t afford to buy 
gas. The economists call this demand 
destruction. Democrats are working to 
achieve demand destruction through 
supply destruction, and the result is 
economic destruction—a destruction of 
the standard of living for the American 
people—all because they want their cli-
mate ideology. 
So Democrats have kept supply slow 
and low. They have driven up prices. 
Now the American people are forced to 
stay home. 
Well, the Transportation Secretary 
continues to say: Just get an electric 
vehicle. Gas prices are no big deal. 
The average electric vehicle costs 
over $55,000. The American people can 
barely afford groceries right now, let 
alone an electric vehicle. CNN ran a 
story recently about single mothers 
skipping meals so their kids can eat. I 
would say to the Secretary of Trans-
portation: How are they going to afford 
the electric vehicle, let alone find a 
place to charge it? 
Astonishing stories have been writ-
ten in the press recently. People trying 
to drive electric vehicles from point A 
to point B said: Never again. Oh, no. 
I have heard stories of someone rent-
ing an electric vehicle in Wyoming, 
driving it from one place to another, 
using a regular plug-in, coming back 
an hour later, and it had charged the 
battery enough extra in that full hour 
that they could go an additional 4 
miles. That is what Joe Biden wants 
for America. That is his view of Amer-
ica—‘‘stay at home’’ Joe. 
The Transportation Secretary refuses 
to admit that gas prices drive up the 
cost of other things like food, the cost 
of retail, the cost of almost everything. 
Democrats tell us that we just need a 
little more wind energy, a little more 
solar power, and things would be great. 
So what is Joe Biden doing? He listens 
to them, and he uses wartime Execu-
tive powers to demand that we make 
more solar panels. 
This is another dangerous Democrat 
delusion. We don’t have high gas prices 
and high food prices because of a lack 
of solar panels; we have high gas prices 
and high food prices because of a lack 
of American gasoline, oil, energy. 
Democrats keep repeating the talk-
ing points about renewable energy. Yet 
they never do the math. The most af-
fordable 
and 
most 
reliable 
energy 
known to man is traditional energy— 
oil, natural gas, coal. Electric vehicles 
still use energy. This energy comes 
mostly, in this country, from natural 
gas and coal. 
The only way to bring the price of 
gas down is to bring the supply of gas 
up. It is the one thing the Democrats 
refuse to do. 
It is interesting to listen to some of 
Joe Biden’s allies in the Senate who 
are threatening to make the Biden en-
ergy crisis even worse. They want to 
talk about bringing back their reckless 
tax-and-spending bill. This bill is more 
reckless today than it was last year. 
You put that kind of additional spend-
ing on the economy, that kind of addi-
tional debt—inflation today is a lot 
higher than it was the last time they 
forced this kind of money onto the 
economy. This will be adding fuel to 
the fire. 
Then the Democrats are talking 
about raising taxes and specifically 
raising taxes on American energy. 
More taxes on American energy means 
higher prices at the pump. It is as sim-
ple as that. Higher prices at the pump 
means higher prices at the grocery 
store. Now isn’t the time to raise taxes 
on the American people. 
Janet Yellen was surprised. She said 
it last week. She talked to the New 
York Times. She said she was surprised 
at how negative people’s opinion was of 
the economy. She said she was amazed 
at how pessimistic people were about 
the economy. How out of touch can one 
be for the Secretary of Treasury to say 
that at a time when there are the high-
est gas prices in the history of the 
country, food prices at an alltime high, 
and inflation at a 40-year high? 
Over three out of four Americans 
think the country is heading in the 
wrong direction under Joe Biden and 
the Democrats. The American people 
have seen what 16 months of Democrat 
rule has done to them, and Janet 
Yellen is surprised at the pessimism 
and the negativity. 
Record inflation, record gas prices, 
record 
debt, 
disappearing 
savings, 
empty shelves, labor shortages, a loom-
ing recession—it is long past time to 
change course. It is time to stop this 
reckless spending, unleash American 
energy. The American public cannot af-
ford to pay the price, but they will 
make the Democrats pay the price 
come November.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
245TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE CREATION OF 
THE 
FLAG 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES AND EXPRESSING SUP-
PORT FOR THE PLEDGE OF AL-
LEGIANCE 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, this is 
one of the more enjoyable things of 
being a Senator, especially when I have 
some friends in from Southern Indiana 
up in the Gallery to see what we do 
here. 
I rise today to offer a resolution ex-
pressing support for the Pledge of Alle-
giance as an expression of patriotism 
and honoring the 245th anniversary of 
the introduction of our United States 
flag. 
Today we celebrate Flag Day, which 
was first established over 100 years ago 
by President Woodrow Wilson. As we 
pause to recognize all that our flag rep-
resents, let us also honor those who 
have sacrificed everything to defend it. 
In 2002, Senator Tom Daschle raised a 
similar resolution with unanimous sup-
port from the Senate. It passed on the 
floor uneventfully. Today, I ask this 
body to reaffirm our support for the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
I also rise to honor a fellow Hoosier 
who knew the innate value of the 
Pledge of Allegiance to civic education. 
In 1969, Red Skelton, the American en-
tertainer who was well-known for the 
program ‘‘The Red Skelton Hour,’’ 
wrote a speech on the importance of 
the pledge. Reflecting on his time in 
Vincennes, IN, he spoke about the val-
ues instilled by one of his high school 
teachers. 
After the performance of the speech, 
CBS received 200,000 requests for cop-
ies. The speech would go on to be sold 
as a single by Columbia Records and 
performed at the White House for 
President Nixon. I think it would 
honor Mr. Skelton’s memory and the 
importance of the Pledge of Allegiance 
if it were recited today on the Senate 
floor in the words of Mr. Red Skelton. 
I have done this 2 prior years too. This 
should never get old for anyone here or 
the American public in general. 
When I was a small boy in Vincennes, [In-
diana,] I heard, I think, one of the most out-
standing speeches I ever heard in my life. I 
think it compares with the Sermon on the 
Mount, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, and 
Socrates’ Speech to the Students. 
We had just finished reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance, and he [Mr. Lasswell, the Prin-
cipal of Vincennes High School] called us all 
together, and he says, ‘‘Uh, boys and girls, I 
have been listening to you recite the Pledge 
of Allegiance all semester, and it seems that 
it has become monotonous to you. Or, could 
it be, you do not understand the meaning of

each word? If I may, I would like to recite 
the pledge, and give you a definition of each 
word: 
I—Me, an individual; a committee of one. 
Pledge—Dedicate all of my worldly good to 
give without self-pity. 
Allegiance—My love and my devotion. 
To the Flag—Our standard. ‘‘Old Glory’’; a 
symbol of courage. And wherever she waves, 
there is respect, because your loyalty has 
given her a dignity that shouts ‘‘Freedom is 
everybody’s job.’’ 
Of the United—That means we have all 
come together. 
States—Individual communities that have 
united into 48 great states 
Remember 
the 
time 
when 
they 
didn’t. 
Forty-eight individual communities with 
pride and dignity and purpose; all divided by 
imaginary boundaries, yet united to a com-
mon cause, and that’s love of country— 
Of America. 
And to the Republic—a Republic: A sov-
ereign state in which power is invested into 
the representatives chosen by the people to 
govern; [us] and the government is the peo-
ple; and it’s from the people to the leaders, 
not from the leaders to the people. 
For which it Stands. 
One Nation—Meaning ‘‘so blessed by God.’’ 
[Under God] 
Indivisible—Incapable of being divided. 
With Liberty—Which is freedom; the right 
of power for one to live his own life without 
fears, threats, or any sort of retaliation. 
And Justice—The principle and qualities of 
dealing fairly with others. 
For All—For All. That means, boys and 
girls, it’s as much your country as it is mine. 
Afterward, Mr. Lasswell asked the 
students to recite the Pledge of Alle-
giance together, with newfound appre-
ciation for the words. 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United 
States of America, and to the Republic, for 
which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with 
liberty and justice for all. 
Mr. Skelton concluded his speech by 
saying: 
Since I was a small boy, two states have 
been added to our country, and two words 
have been added to the Pledge of Allegiance: 
‘‘Under God.’’ Wouldn’t it be a pity if some-
one said, ‘‘That is a prayer’’—and that it be 
eliminated from our schools, too? 
Just as those students that day, Mr. 
Red Skelton included, recommitted to 
the meaning of the words of the Pledge 
of Allegiance, I call upon the U.S. Sen-
ate to recommit to these words as well. 
There are times today that the words 
of the Pledge of Allegiance are tossed 
around without care. Other times, they 
are altered to remove what today is 
deemed offensive or antiquated. But 
Americans should not misuse or abuse 
our Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge of 
Allegiance is meant to remind Ameri-
cans of our guiding principles and in-
spire adherence to those ideas which 
make 
our 
country 
great: 
equality 
under the law, recognized rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
This is why today, on National Flag 
Day, I am requesting unanimous con-
sent from my colleagues that my reso-
lution 
expressing 
support 
for 
the 
Pledge of Allegiance is passed. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res. 671, submitted 
earlier today; further, I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 671) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. BRAUN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 3967 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, as we 
know, the Senate is currently consid-
ering the Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson Honoring our PACT Act. This 
bipartisan legislation is the most com-
prehensive toxic exposure bill ever con-
sidered for veterans. 
Passing toxic exposure legislation 
has been a priority for Senator TESTER, 
the chairman of the committee, and for 
me, the ranking member, and we want-
ed to do it this Congress, and we are 
close to accomplishing that. 
Last Congress, we were able to de-
liver landmark mental health legisla-
tion for veterans, and this Congress, we 
were committed to passing long-lasting 
solutions that will reform the VA’s 
process by which veterans who were ex-
posed to burn pits and Agent Orange 
receive their benefits and healthcare. 
About a month ago, Senator TESTER 
and I announced a bipartisan agree-
ment 
and 
introduced 
the 
historic 
Heath Robinson PACT Act. Part of the 
agreement between the chairman and 
me was that two amendments would be 
considered for this legislation. 
I offered an amendment to strike the 
creation of a fund which would classify 
over $116 billion in discretionary costs 
associated with the bill as entitlement 
spending. I believe that this untested 
and unique way of classifying spending 
lessens congressional oversight at a 
time of massive debt and deficits, and 
it sets a bad precedent. 
Senator LEE has an amendment re-
quiring the Secretary to use science 
when evaluating presumptions estab-
lished in the bill. That amendment has 
been filed. 
Senator ERNST has an amendment re-
quiring the Secretary to certify that 
with the resources and authorities pro-
vided through this bill, there won’t be 
a negative consequence for veterans in 
the system. 
There are at least three amendments 
proposing to offset the cost of the bill 
or at least a portion thereof with 
spending reductions elsewhere. 
I am hopeful that in the days ahead, 
before final passage of this bill, we will 
let our colleagues be heard through an 
amendment process, pass or fail. 
I have also hoped that the two 
amendments that I expected to be able 
to offer would be made in order. That 
hasn’t been the case to date, and there-
fore I ask unanimous consent that it be 
made in order for the following amend-
ments to be made pending to the sub-
stitute amendment No. 5051 by their 
sponsors or their designees: One, the 
Ernst amendment, Secretary of VA 
certification, No. 5072; two, the Lee 
amendment to modify the authority to 
create presumptions, No. 5048; the 
Johnson amendment to pay for COVID 
money, amendment No. 5055; the Paul 
amendment, to pay for this legislation 
from USAID, No. 5060; the Blackburn 
community care amendment, No. 5075; 
my amendment, the community care 
amendment, No. 5064; my amendment 
to strike section 805, No. 5063; the Mar-
shall amendment on collective bar-
gaining, 
No. 
5071; 
the 
Murkowski 
amendment on appraisals for housing 
loans, No. 5069; and the Inhofe amend-
ment concerning Camp Lejeune, No. 
5094. I further ask that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader, in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate vote in relation to these 
amendments in the order listed; fur-
ther, that upon disposition of the 
amendments 
listed, 
all 
postcloture 
time on the substitute amendment No. 
5051 be expired and the remaining pend-
ing amendments be withdrawn, with 
the exception of the substitute amend-
ment No. 5051, as amended, if amended, 
and that the Senate vote on adoption 
of 
the 
substitute 
amendment, 
as 
amended, if amended; and finally, that 
upon disposition of amendment No. 
5051, as amended, if amended, the clo-
ture motion with respect to the under-
lying bill, H.R. 3967, be withdrawn, the 
bill, as amended, if amended, be read a 
third time, and the Senate vote on pas-
sage of the bill, as amended, if amend-
ed, with 60 affirmative votes required 
for passage. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Reserving the right to 
object, we are here on the cusp of doing 
something that really tells the fighting 
men and women who serve in our mili-
tary all around the world that we have 
got your back. 
We are here because of what I would 
say is a great working relationship be-
tween the ranking member, Senator 
MORAN, and myself. As I said in the VA 
Committee earlier, that relationship is 
going to continue regardless, and the 
reason is because, in this place, there is 
something that is missing, and it is 
called trust. And I trust Senator 
MORAN. We have been through this for 
the last year and a half and even 
longer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2933 
June 14, 2022 
When you were chairman of the com-
mittee, many of the bills that are in 
this package, you oversaw their pas-
sage out of committee. 
But because negotiations continue 
and because I still believe, even though 
this process is very broken—we both 
know that—I still believe that we are 
going to be able to come to something 
that both of us can agree on with 
amendments through our leadership— 
by the way, we would agree on some-
thing anyway—but through our leader-
ship. That is why I am objecting to 
your motion. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I would 
conclude by encouraging the chairman 
of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs to use his substantial level of 
influence with the leaders that he de-
scribed as necessary to approve the 
consideration of these amendments. 
He speaks of the word ‘‘trust,’’ and I 
have great trust in his ability to ac-
complish the desired outcome that I 
have. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, may I 
ask the ranking member of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee a question? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Through 
the Presiding Officer, you are allowed 
to do that. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, are you 
asking me to throw my weight around? 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, may I 
make an inquiry of the Senator from 
Montana through the Chair? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, you 
may. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, if I an-
swered the question, Mr. Chairman, 
would that be considered derogatory? 
Perhaps it is a parliamentary in-
quiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think 
in Montana, it is considered a com-
pliment. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here for the 15th time in my series 
of ‘‘Scheme’’ speeches to call attention 
to the rightwing donors’ long-planned 
scheme to capture and control our Su-
preme Court. 
What I will talk about today is that 
scheme’s donor-funded doctrine factory 
and a case in which the ‘‘Court that 
dark money built’’ could weaponize 
dangerous, 
concocted 
doctrines 
to 
power up polluters and threaten the 
basic function of government. 
Before I get into this, let me say that 
I detest and condemn violence or 
threatened violence against members 
of the Court, and I object even to pro-
testers making a racket in Justices’ 
neighborhoods. There is a lot to be 
angry 
about, 
but 
the 
solution 
is 
through democracy and laws, not vio-
lence and noise. The capture of the 
Court by secret and special interests is 
deadly serious under our laws, and we 
have to respond seriously under our 
laws. Neighborhood noise and violent 
threats don’t help. 
Let’s remember that all three Trump 
Supreme Court Justices were actually 
chosen and then campaigned for by a 
dark money donor apparatus. Remem-
ber, the whole point of the scheme is to 
capture the Court so it will deliver big 
wins for the big rightwing donors, no 
matter how unpopular or radical those 
wins are. Remember that the donor 
elite behind the scheme spent hundreds 
of millions of dollars on an apparatus 
to capture the courts. It plotted for 
decades to seize this power and set up 
a system to get its hand-picked, ex-
tremist nominees onto the Bench. It 
instructs those Justices with coordi-
nated flotillas of amicus briefs so the 
Justices know how they are supposed 
to rule. It is quite an operation. 
But none of that works—none of that 
works if judges are following the law as 
it is. Existing legal precedents are a 
problem for the scheme. So, to accom-
plish 
its 
mission, 
a 
radical 
deconstruction of our American laws, 
the big donor elite need to destroy dec-
ades of legal precedent. 
We got a preview in the looming ef-
fort, shown by the Alito leaked draft 
opinion, to destroy precedent pro-
tecting women’s right to decide about 
abortion and relocate that right from 
women to State legislatures. That is 
just the scheme’s opening act, a sop to 
one segment of its social issues base. 
The scheme is out to deconstruct 
American law and destroy established 
precedent across many areas of the 
law. 
Now, if you are out to deconstruct 
American law and replace it with what 
the big donors want, you need some in-
tellectual weaponry. You don’t just 
need Justices who will do what you 
ask, you need legal theories. You need 
to give the Justices you put on the 
Court the intellectual artillery—the 
demolition theories—that will help 
them 
destroy 
the 
precedents 
and 
deconstruct our legal system. 
So that is a problem. 
But when you are spending more 
than half a billion dollars on such a 
scheme, you can find solutions. And 
sure enough, rightwing donor interests 
found solutions. It took time, but the 
whole scheme took time. It took a lot 
of money, but the whole scheme took a 
lot of money. It took patience and 
planning, but what a payoff when you 
succeed. 
And now it is payday. 
The first thing you do is erect an 
array of legal think tanks, phony insti-
tutes, the hothouses in which the 
deconstruction theories are grown; the 
factories, if you will, where doctrines 
are crafted, reverse-engineered from 
the results the big donors want so that 
willing, complicit Justices have the 
ideological 
weaponry 
for 
deconstruction of the law. 
These think tanks do a couple of 
things. First, they nurture rightwing 
legal scholars to formulate bogus legal 
doctrines. They pay them comfortable 
salaries. They grant them nice titles. 
They cover their trips to conferences 
and symposia with fellow hothouse 
scholars. The whole thing apes regular 
academia, but this academia-resem-
bling performance has a very different 
mission: It has deliverables. 
Second, 
they 
systematically 
cheerlead for their new legal doctrines. 
They create an echo chamber of ap-
proval for their cultivated fringe ideas. 
Once the hothouse conjures a fringe 
idea, the hothouse bounces it among 
other so-called scholars and through 
other anonymously funded affiliate 
groups and through law school debate 
clubs and conservative conferences— 
also funded by secretive donors—and 
into flotillas of scripted amicus curiae 
briefs and ultimately, the prize, into 
legal 
opinions. 
They 
create 
a 
legitimization process, and of course 
they concoct or retool the desirable 
theories. 
The legal theories are actually pretty 
easy to come up with. You reverse-en-
gineer. You start with what big donor 
interests want and then work back-
ward. And what lots of big donors 
want—especially 
fossil 
fuel 
compa-
nies—is to weaken and disable govern-
ment regulation. 
Government regulators stop all sorts 
of harmful corporate practices: pollu-
tion of our air, water, and climate; 
dangerous factory floor working condi-
tions; crooked schemes that cheat in-
vestors; snake oil medications that 
don’t cure disease; unsafe products; in-
surance policies that don’t pay. The 
list is long. Demolishing that protec-
tive network of regulations protecting 
America’s health, safety, and financial 
well-being is a scheme priority, and the 
destruction 
begins 
by 
pejoratively 
naming the Agencies whose work pro-
tects us the ‘‘administrative state.’’ 
There are many of these doctrine- 
growing hothouses. Two examples are 
the Cato Institute, originally founded 
by the Koch brothers, and the C. 
Boyden Gray Center for the Study of 
the Administrative State at George 
Mason 
University’s 
Antonin 
Scalia 
Law School, of course. Both of these 
groups are funded to pump out and le-
gitimize anti-regulatory fringe theo-
ries and talking points. 
Think of them as factories for ideo-
logical artillery designed for the demo-
lition of Federal Agencies’ authority, 
particularly over polluters. 
What do they manufacture? Well, the 
concocted doctrines fall into a few 
buckets. There is the so-called unitary 
executive theory, cooked up to argue

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2934 
June 14, 2022 
that safeguards set in place by Con-
gress 
to 
protect 
Federal 
Agencies 
against political interference are un-
constitutional. 
Now, if you are a big donor and you 
paid big bucks to get your man in the 
White House, you want political inter-
ference by your guy in regulatory deci-
sions. 
Congress built safeguards against 
that for a very good reason. But a cap-
tured Court could disable Congress’s 
ability to defend the Agencies that 
Congress itself created. This unitary 
executive legal theory was the pet the-
ory of the Reagan administration. It 
was thoroughly debunked by serious 
scholars and rejected initially even by 
the Supreme Court. But the rightwing 
Court-capture apparatus has persist-
ently kept this theory a Federalist So-
ciety 
cornerstone 
and 
diligently 
packed the Court with new Justices 
more amenable to this nonsense. 
Other concocted doctrines also target 
Agencies. The so-called nondelegation 
doctrine is so radical and meritless 
that the Supreme Court dismissed it a 
century ago, except for rare cases that 
no longer exist where Congress might 
give Agencies power with no direction 
whatsoever. 
This nondelegation idea has been re-
tooled in the doctrine factories to tar-
get Agency regulation generally. Under 
this doctrine as retooled, the power is 
removed from Congress and given to 
unelected courts to decide how ques-
tions should be assigned by Congress to 
Federal Agencies. This gives big, regu-
lated industries a big weapon to attack 
the Federal Government’s ability to 
regulate problems that they cause, at a 
minimum allowing industries to tie 
public protection regulations up in 
years, even decades, of litigation. 
Federalist Society Justices on the 
Court long clamored for the nondelega-
tion doctrine, and as new Federalist 
Society Justices get added to the 
Court, it becomes more probable. Cer-
tainly the dark money front groups 
that provide instruction and encour-
agement to the Federalist Society Jus-
tices—they are in full clamor, using 
amicus curiae briefs to signal their 
wishes to the captured Court. 
On now to yet another hothouse- 
grown doctrine, the major questions 
doctrine, which provides a similar 
weapons platform to assault public 
safety regulations. Where the nondele-
gation doctrine would require Congress 
to set more specific regulatory stand-
ards for Agencies to police, the major 
questions 
doctrine 
would 
let 
the 
unelected Court determine that some 
questions are just too big to regulate— 
too big to regulate at all. 
Again, at a minimum, that lets big 
industries snarl Agency protections up 
in litigation. At worst, it forces Con-
gress into detailed, complex questions 
that Congress already determined—al-
ready determined—should better be 
handled by expert Agencies. 
Perhaps I should mention here how 
hard the Federalist Society Justices 
have worked to create avenues of cor-
porate political influence, including 
anonymous, unlimited, corporate polit-
ical spending, allowing corporate inter-
ests to blockade action in Congress; 
but while it is relevant here, that is a 
longer story for another day. 
All of these concocted doctrines 
share the premise that Congress may 
not deploy Agency regulation against 
certain problems and that the power to 
grant Agencies authority to regulate in 
certain areas is, instead, to be decided 
by unelected courts—in present cir-
cumstances, decided by a captured Su-
preme Court with Members installed by 
big special interest money. 
What could possibly go wrong? 
All of these concocted doctrines over-
look the robust oversight of Federal 
Agencies by the people’s Representa-
tives in Congress and by courts, tasked 
by Congress, with applying the Admin-
istrative Procedure Act. If an Agency 
were to go rogue, Congress can imme-
diately intervene. Congress can reverse 
the decision of the Agency. Congress 
can change the underlying law the 
Agency enforces. Congress can redirect, 
defund, or even eliminate the errant 
Agency. Moreover, if Agencies don’t 
follow the law as Congress directed or 
if the Agencies behave illogically or 
unfairly or don’t give evidence proper 
consideration, there are avenues of 
legal relief in court. 
But the donors behind the scheme 
don’t want relief from improper or mis-
guided Agency action. They want relief 
from lawful, legitimate, and correct 
Agency action. This is a power grab by 
regulated interests using the Court, 
and they can do it because of the 
scheme. It is not a bug that these doc-
trines threaten harm to an array of 
basic government functions; it is their 
purpose. 
Let’s go back to what the rightwing, 
corporate-funded propaganda machine 
likes to deride as the ‘‘administrative 
state’’—their little code word. What 
has really gone on in these Agencies? I 
will tell you what has gone on. 
Over nonstop quarreling by big spe-
cial 
interests, 
regulatory 
Agencies 
made life better. They made drinking 
water safer. They cleaned up smoke-
stacks. They put airbags in cars and re-
quired better seatbelts. They protected 
us from contaminated food. They made 
medication safer and more effective— 
no more snake oil mysteries. They 
made financial markets safer places for 
retirement funds and college savings 
plans to grow. They made it harder for 
stockjobbers to sucker innocent inves-
tors. They required insurance policies 
to actually pay when an insured risk 
occurs. They put an end to people 
dying from disasters like boiler explo-
sions that used to be a regular thing. 
Americans live longer; highways are no 
longer carnage; products are safer; 
markets are stronger; and the Amer-
ican economy is more robust. So, 
whenever you hear the phrase ‘‘admin-
istrative state,’’ it should ring in your 
head a little alarm bell that special in-
terest mischief is afoot, which brings 
me to the ruling expected from the Su-
preme Court in a case called West Vir-
ginia v. EPA. 
The fossil fuel interests behind the 
case are challenging the Federal Gov-
ernment’s power to regulate green-
house gas emissions from existing coal- 
fired power plants. Put simply, they 
want to make it harder to fight cli-
mate change. I can’t think of a more 
important protection for the American 
people than a livable planet, and I 
can’t think of a Member of Congress 
who has done more work to achieve 
those protections than the Presiding 
Officer, but the fossil fuel industry is 
desperate to continue to pollute for 
free. 
The first thing to know about this 
case is that there is no case. The Con-
stitution requires ‘‘a case or con-
troversy’’—that is the language in the 
Constitution: ‘‘a case or controversy’’ 
before the Court can intervene—and, 
here, there is no case because there is 
no Agency rule to challenge. The 
Trump administration’s rule, which 
was a sop to polluters, was thrown 
out—gone. The Obama-era rule is not 
being pursued—gone. Biden’s EPA has 
announced that it is formulating a 
new, different rule that it has not yet 
produced. It is not out. There is no rule 
in place right now. 
That does not seem to bother the 
scheme’s new donor-selected majority. 
A few Republican States, bolstered and 
probably directed by an armada of 
rightwing, dark-money front groups, 
sued to challenge the EPA’s authority, 
and the captured Court jumped right 
in. 
Think about that for a moment. 
With no actual rule to review, the 
Court is, apparently, going to decide 
this case based on what the Biden ad-
ministration might do or issue some 
general observations about the EPA. 
Where I come from, there is a name for 
that. It is called an advisory opinion, 
and our Supreme Court is forbidden to 
do that under our Constitution. 
This is actually a big deal at the 
heart of the separation of powers, but 
the Federalist Society Justices, packed 
onto the Court with fossil fuel dark 
money, are on a mission to deconstruct 
the administrative state. So why let 
the Constitution get in the way? Just 
throw out more precedent about case 
or controversy. What is one more 
smashed precedent in the captured 
Court’s cascade of precedent demoli-
tion? The donors don’t care. They are 
not finicky. They want results. 
Fossil fuel is the political 800-pound 
gorilla in this country. The industry 
spent decades blocking climate action 
in Congress. It lurked behind this web 
of climate denial front groups that 
sowed 
false 
doubt 
about 
climate 
science. 
It 
was 
their 
job 
to 
mischaracterize the science. It is be-
hind what watchdog group Influence 
Map calls the biggest climate-obstruct-
ing trade organization in Washington— 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Boom.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2935 
June 14, 2022 
It maintains its own trade group 
hitmen, like the American Petroleum 
Institute. It funnels secret money by 
the tens of millions into Republican 
super-PACs and other secret, partisan 
political spending fronts in a not-so- 
hostile takeover of the Republican 
Party, and it wrote some of the biggest 
checks to pay for the scheme, funneled 
through 
dark-money 
conduits 
like 
DonorsTrust and the Judicial Crisis 
Network. 
When I say we now have the Court 
that dark money built, it is probably 
more accurate to say that we now have 
the Court that dark fossil fuel money 
built. So watch out for the six-Justice 
supermajority that is poised to rule in 
this no case ‘‘case.’’ 
It is no surprise that the amici—the 
amicus curiae, the so-called friends of 
the Court—gathered in this case read 
like a who’s who of fossil fuel polluter 
front groups. The Competitive Enter-
prise Institute, for instance, produces 
hothouse attacks on the EPA’s author-
ity, and is funded by ExxonMobil, Mur-
ray Energy, the American Fuel and Pe-
trochemical Manufacturers, the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute, and the Koch 
brothers’ political groups. Fossil fuel 
front groups, as amici and litigants, 
sing a harmonious chorus of ‘‘unitary 
executive’’ and ‘‘nondelegation’’ and 
‘‘major question’’—all concocted doc-
trines targeting the administrative 
state they so resent. 
Back before the takeover, here is 
what the Court said in a case called 
Mistretta. 
The Court said this: 
In our increasingly complex society, re-
plete with ever changing and more technical 
problems, Congress simply cannot do its job 
absent an ability to delegate power under 
broad general directives. 
That is the language of the Court: 
In our increasingly complex society, re-
plete with ever changing and more technical 
problems, Congress simply cannot do its job 
absent an ability to delegate power under 
broad general directives. 
That is the precedent of the Court. 
That is the law of the land, and it is 
the law that special interests sent 
these 
Justices 
to 
the 
Court 
to 
deconstruct. So get ready. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING JULIE BECKETT 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the incredible life and 
legacy of Julie Beckett, a champion for 
individuals who experience disabilities 
and for their families. 
In 1978, Julie’s daughter Katie was 
born, and 4 months later, Katie con-
tracted a brain infection that left her 
paralyzed and on a ventilator. After 2 
years of living in a hospital, Katie’s 
family had reached the limit on their 
health insurance policy and applied for 
support through Medicaid but were 
told that Medicaid would not cover at- 
home care. 
Julie and her husband, Mark, knew 
they did not want their daughter grow-
ing up in a hospital, especially when 
she could receive the care that she 
needed at home while also being with 
her loved ones. 
Faced with uncertainty and with 
Federal officials who would not make 
an exception, Julie reached out to her 
Congressman. Julie noted that making 
this exception for her daughter would 
not only be good for her family but 
also that keeping her at home rather 
than at a hospital would cost the gov-
ernment far less money. 
Julie’s advocacy worked. Because she 
made the choice to speak up and share 
her story, Congress passed and Presi-
dent Reagan signed into law an excep-
tion to Medicaid rules that enabled 
Julie’s family and many others to care 
for their loved ones at home. 
Julie’s work has had a profound im-
pact on not just her own family but 
countless others, including my own. 
My son Ben experiences severe physical 
disabilities, and because of Julie’s ad-
vocacy, he could grow up at home and 
with family. And because he was able 
to live at home, Ben had the oppor-
tunity to go to school, to learn, and 
make friends in our community. 
The terrible reality is that before 
Julie, many children grew up in hos-
pitals or in institutionalized care, in-
stead of surrounded by the love and 
care of their families, siblings, and 
neighbors. 
But my family’s story is not unique. 
In the decades since, what is now 
known as the Katie Beckett waiver has 
changed hundreds of thousands of lives. 
More than half a million children have 
received these waivers and have been 
able to live, grow, and thrive at home. 
Julie’s story is an example of how 
one person can make a true difference 
in our democracy. And even after her 
successful work in securing this signifi-
cant exception for Medicaid, Julie kept 
fighting for children who experienced 
disabilities. She helped lead a charge 
to expand coverage and fought against 
attempts to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act. And critically, she worked with 
families throughout the country to 
show them how they could be advo-
cates as well. 
Julie passed away last month, but 
her legacy will live on in the lives that 
she has changed and the advocacy that 
she helped to inspire. I am profoundly 
grateful for her work, and I join with 
people across the country in commit-
ting to carrying on her legacy of fight-
ing to fully include people with disabil-
ities in every facet of American life. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

applied by substituting ‘‘individual who per-
formed qualifying service’’ for ‘‘employee or 
Member’’.

MORNING BUSINESS 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING NELSON W. MIL-
NER, 
SR., 
AND 
CLARENCE 
R. 
MILNER, SR. 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Nelson W. Milner, Sr., and 
Clarence R. Milner, Sr. Both men were 
beloved relatives of former Hartford, 
CT, mayor Thirman L. Milner, the first 
elected African-American mayor in 
New England. They passed away earlier 
this year and leave extraordinary leg-
acies 
of 
thoughtful, 
compassionate 
work. 
Nelson was born in Hartford, CT, and 
was the brother of former Mayor Mil-
ner. Upon graduating from high school, 
he joined the Air Force, serving for 3 
years. Stationed in Riverside, CA, Nel-
son remained in the State with his late 
wife, Arthurrine, following his service. 
In the 1980s, Nelson returned to Hart-
ford in support of his brother’s mayoral 
campaign. 
Passionate about serving others, Nel-
son became an ordained deacon and 
taught Sunday school. He also played 
the keyboard with the East Hartford 
senior center band. Nelson focused his 
final years on strengthening his rela-
tionship with his family, including his 
10 children, 5 stepchildren, and many 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
He passed away on February 15, 2022, at 
the age of 90. 
Nelson and Arthurrine’s son, Clar-
ence, was born in California. He would 
go on to have 10 children of his own, as 
well 
as 
4 
stepchildren, 
41 
grand-
children, and 7 great-grandchildren. 
Clarence dedicated his life to his Chris-
tian faith and volunteered as a fire-
fighter. Just like his father, he moved 
back to Hartford to work on his uncle’s 
mayoral campaign. In addition to sup-
porting his uncle’s successful bid to be-
come the city’s first African- American 
mayor, Clarence also committed him-
self to running several businesses. 
Family was at the heart of every-
thing Clarence did. He was inseparable 
from his identical twin, Carl, for many 
years. Clarence met his wife in Hart-
ford and spent as much time as possible 
with all of his children and grand-
children. He passed away on January 
11, 2022, at the age of 64. 
My wife Cynthia and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to former Mayor 
Milner and all of Nelson and Clarence’s 
loved ones. May their many wonderful 
memories of both men provide them 
solace and comfort in the days ahead. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in re-
membering Nelson W. Milner, Sr., and 
Clarence R. Milner, Sr.∑

RECOGNIZING THE STEWART IN-
DIAN SCHOOL CULTURAL CEN-
TER AND MUSEUM 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I come forward today to recognize the 
grand opening of the Stewart Indian 
School Cultural Center and Museum. 
Three miles south of Carson City, the 
Stewart Indian School opened in 1890 
with the official purpose of addressing 
Indigenous education. In reality, stu-
dents were made to forget their Native 
languages and were allowed little to no 
contact with family members for dec-
ades, thereby destroying important 
cultural and social connections. Today, 
Stewart Indian School is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places 
and remains open as an important edu-
cational and historic landmark in Ne-
vada. 
After its closing in 1982, the State of 
Nevada assumed the property and 
began taking steps to reconcile its 
painful history with our community. 
Most notably, it returned 130 acres of 
land to the Washoe Tribe of Nevada 
and California. Since then, the Nevada 
Indian Commission has worked hard to 
preserve the history and stories of its 
alumni. In 2008, it helped establish a 
self-guided walking tour of the campus, 
and in 2015, it worked with the Nevada 
State Legislature to secure funding for 
a museum director and curator for the 
location. With the help of volunteers 
and staff, members of this museum 
have worked hard to record and display 
only some of the 30,000 Stewart Indian 
School alumni stories, with many 
members being alumni or descendants 
themselves. 
On May 11 of this year, the U.S. Inte-
rior Department released the Federal 
Indian Boarding School Initiative In-
vestigative Report that summarized 
the treatment of Indigenous children in 
over 400 boarding schools across the 
country. The report unveils heart-
breaking findings. Many of these chil-
dren were taken from their commu-
nities and were forced to attend these 
schools. While there, they often faced 
rampant emotional, sexual, and phys-
ical abuse. The report also makes it 
clear that, from the beginning, these 
schools were designed to strip children 
of their Indigenous identities. The re-
sulting trauma impacted families for 
generations, and some parents went as 
far as refusing to teach their children 
their Native language or ways of life 
for fear that they too would be severely 
punished in school for expressing them-
selves. Stewart Indian School stands 
here today as one of these former 408 
boarding schools. 
I would like to commend the efforts 
of the Nevada Indian Commission, of 
museum directors and staff, and of 
alumni and their descendants who have 
made the official grand opening of the 
Stewart Indian School Cultural Center 
and Museum possible. It is important 
that we recognize the history of our 
community and acknowledge the testi-
monies of all those who continue to en-
dure the pain and loss that resulted 
from decades of separation and cultural 
erasure. Finally, thank you to all of 
those who bravely shared and pub-
licized their stories so that we may 
learn a bit more and work to never for-
get.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO CAROLE JOHNSON 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Carole Johnson of Mineral County for 
her dedication to the Forest Service 
and her 50-plus years of public service 
to the people of Montana. 
Raised in Superior, MT, Carole grad-
uated from Montana State Univer-
sity—‘‘Go Cats!’’—and joined the U.S. 
Forest Service in 1971. Carole started 
as a seasonal recreational employee on 
the Superior Ranger District of the 
Lolo National Forest and has since 
worked in nearly every facet of the 
Forest Service including firefighting, 
logistics, silviculture, surveying, min-
ing, and conservation education. In 
2015, Carole was named Superior Dis-
trict ranger, the post she held until re-
tiring earlier this spring. According to 
most accounts, at the time of her re-
tirement, 
Carole 
was 
the 
longest 
tenured federal employee in the State 
of Montana. 
Anyone who knows Carole will tell 
you that she exemplifies the definition 
of a public servant. For more than 50 
years, she served her community with 
unmatched 
institutional 
knowledge 
and professionalism. She has been a 
voice of reason in debates over public 
lands management emphasizing that 
forest management and conservation 
go hand in hand. As district ranger, 
Carole worked tirelessly to increase 
the timber output on the Superior Dis-
trict to help benefit the local economy 
and support wildfire mitigation in the 
community. 
Outside of her role with the Forest 
Service, Carole is active in her commu-
nity. She serves on many boards in-
cluding the Mineral Community Hos-
pital Board, Mineral Fair Board and 
the Glacier Country Tourism Board. 
Through her commitment to public 
service, it is clear that Carole has long 
been 
a 
well-respected 
and 
beloved 
member of the Mineral County commu-
nity. 
It is my honor to recognize Carole for 
her dedication to the Forest Service 
and her 50-plus years of public service 
to the great State of Montana. Carole, 
thank you for your many years of pub-
lic service and commitment to improv-
ing our public lands and forests. I wish 
you all the best in your retirement. 
You make Montana proud.∑

TRIBUTE TO KAREN GOODE 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, it 
is an honor to pay tribute today to Ms. 
Karen Goode, who has retired after 47 
years of dedicated public service with 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Regional Office in Jackson, MS. 
Since becoming a U.S. Senator in 2018, 
I have come to appreciate Ms. Goode 
who has earned consistent high praise 
from my State office staff responsible 
for assisting veterans with their VA 
claims. Karen’s knowledge, responsive-
ness, reliability, and trustworthiness 
have enabled me to serve Mississippi’s

veterans better and more effectively, 
and I am very thankful to her for that. 
Karen began her career with the VA 
in 1975 in a clerical position with the fi-
nance department. A GS–3 at the time 
she was hired, Karen is retiring as a 
GS–13 supervisory veterans service rep-
resentative, which is evidence of her 
meritorious work leading to continual 
promotions throughout her Federal 
civil service career. In the process, she 
acquired the knowledge and skill sets 
for processing all claims for compensa-
tion, pension, education, vocational, 
and rehabilitation. Ms. Goode’s thor-
ough understanding of the claims re-
view process, along with her excellent 
management skills, propelled her into 
key senior leadership roles that led her 
to supervising seven different employee 
teams over her VA career. 
Ms. Goode’s high degree of profes-
sionalism earned her multiple special 
recognitions. At the recommendation 
of the veterans service center manager, 
Karen in 2006 served as the representa-
tive for the southern area on a quality 
assurance detail HELP team in Wash-
ington, DC. In 2012, at the completion 
of a designated special project as qual-
ity team coach, Karen obtained Lean 
Six Sigma Green Belt designation. 
Even though Congress writes the 
laws regarding veterans’ benefits, it is 
up to teams set up within the VA to re-
view veterans’ claims and determine if 
they are eligible for benefits. It can be 
a complex and lengthy process, which I 
highly respect. Covering a broad range 
of benefit categories, I understand the 
effectiveness in which VA team mem-
ber groups review and process claims 
can differ greatly. Despite exercising 
most of her leadership away from the 
public eye, Mississippi’s veterans are 
fortunate to have been served by Ms. 
Karen Goode for so many years work-
ing in this capacity. She has been un-
wavering in her commitment to ensur-
ing that Mississippi’s veterans receive 
the benefits to which they are entitled 
under the law. 
In conclusion, I am incredibly grate-
ful to Ms. Karen Goode for dedicating 
her career to serving those who have 
served our country. I commend her for 
her many accomplishments, and I send 
her my best wishes for an enjoyable re-
tirement.∑

TRIBUTE TO DANA TOTMAN 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize Dana Totman for his 
22 years of service at Avesta Housing 
and congratulate him on a well-de-
served retirement. Under his leader-
ship, Avesta Housing became northern 
New England’s largest housing non-
profit and transformed the lives of in-
dividuals and families across Maine. 
Dana has been a tireless advocate for 
affordable housing and made it clear 
how drastically it improves lives and 
strengthens communities. 
While Dana cares about the bricks 
and mortar that become the homes of 
many, he cares most about the people 
who get to call these places home. It is 
these individuals who drive his passion. 
The Maine Affordable Housing Coali-
tion, created by Dana, exemplifies his 
vision by giving those in need a voice 
and the ability to advocate for them-
selves. 
During the 2009 recession, Dana found 
a creative way to increase the supply 
of affordable homes through the devel-
opment of a $50 million bond proposal. 
Known as the Green Affordable Hous-
ing Bond, this allowed low-income 
Mainers to obtain affordable, energy- 
efficient homes, and created jobs in the 
construction, architectural, and engi-
neering sectors. Subsequently, when 
Maine seniors needed a voice for their 
growing housing needs, Dana created 
and promoted the $15 million Maine Af-
fordable Housing Bond, the effort gar-
nered support from 69 percent of Maine 
voters—one of the largest margin wins 
of a State bond initiative. 
Throughout his career, Dana navi-
gated through the many obstacles and 
challenges Avesta Housing faced. His 
humility and quiet demeanor brought 
people and organizations together to 
demonstrate how affordable housing 
significantly strengthens communities’ 
well-being. His ability to work closely 
with neighbors, listen to concerns, and 
understand 
the 
whole 
picture, 
furthered Avesta Housing’s mission of 
giving everyone, regardless of socio-
economic status, age, or race, a chance 
to have a home. 
Dana was raised on a Topsham dairy 
farm, and later lived in Brunswick, 
where he and his wife raised their two 
sons and were members of the school 
community as parents. Dana also vol-
unteered to coach soccer and baseball 
teams, imparting many life lessons to 
the kids. He continues to mentor 
young people, inspiring future genera-
tions to dedicate their lives to giving 
back to their communities. 
Maine’s business community has rec-
ognized Dana multiple times over the 
years for his exceptional leadership and 
contributions to equitable housing in 
Maine. It is a privilege to join with his 
colleagues, friends, and the people of 
Maine in recognizing Dana for dem-
onstrating innovation, true excellence 
in his work, and unwavering compas-
sion to those seeking—and finding—a 
home.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, 
Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. DAINES, Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. YOUNG, and Mr. 
CASSIDY): 
S. 4393. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the 
maximum capital gains tax rate, to 
modify the tax on net investment in-
come, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to tell my colleagues 
about a bill I am introducing today to 
encourage savings. To set the stage for 
the necessity of that bill, I am going to 
speak for a minute about the obstacles 
that this administration’s economic 
policies—particularly 
inflation—have 
put in that give need for such legisla-
tion. 
On Friday, we learned that inflation 
surged to 8.6 percent, a new 40-year 
high for inflation. Inflation is the No. 1 
concern that I hear from Iowans as I do 
my 99-county tour throughout the 
State over the course of a year. I hear 
how rising prices, particularly for food 
and energy, are cutting into budgets, 
making it difficult to make ends meet. 
Moreover, I hear from Iowans who 
are concerned that inflation is eating 
into their savings. That gets to the 
purpose of the legislation I am going to 
soon talk about. This is particularly 
true for seniors who are living on fixed 
budgets and are dependent on their 
savings and investment income to keep 
their heads above water. 
Yet President Biden and congres-
sional Democrats continue to ignore 
the damage done by their reckless tax- 
and-spending agenda. Sadly, their solu-
tion for inflation is just more of the 
same old Democratic tax-and-spend 
agenda. We still hear rumors that there 
may be some version of Build Back 
Better. Just think. If that original 
version of Build Back Better had 
passed, we would have had another $4.5 
trillion in additional spending feeding 
the fires of inflation. Thank God for 50 
Republicans and Senator MANCHIN that 
that has not happened. 
Several Democrats have argued for 
hiking taxes to combat inflation. How-
ever, their proposed tax hikes on job 
creators would suppress business in-
vestment, lowering productivity. This 
would be counterproductive at a time 
when consumers’ demands far outpace 
supply. We need more production, not 
less, to combat unchecked inflation. 
Moreover, the proposed Democratic 
tax hikes would be passed on to the 
middle class in the form of lower wages 
and higher prices. These tax hikes 
would further squeeze a middle class 
that is already enduring the worst of 
inflation. 
I 
just 
complimented 
Senator 
MANCHIN for putting a stop to Build 
Back Better. When it comes to some of 
the original tax policies we have heard 
from the Democrats, we can thank 
Senator SINEMA, another Democrat, for 
stepping in and bringing at least some 
common sense to tax policy, even 
though it wasn’t a complete change of 
that tax policy. Raising taxes on job 
creation isn’t the only misguided tax 
proposal. While many consumer prod-
ucts are in short supply, ill-conceived 
Democratic proposals are not. 
In addition to reckless tax hikes on 
businesses broadly, Democrats have 
proposed providing consumer gas re-
bates, forgiving student loan debt, im-
posing windfall profit taxes on oil and 
gas, and implementing price controls. 
None of these proposals would help 
tamp down inflation. Instead, they 
would only make things worse—much 
worse. 
Instead of providing relief, gas re-
bates would increase demand, driving 
prices higher. Forgiving student loans 
would have a similar effect and would 
be horribly counterproductive and, at 
the same time, would be very unfair to 
those students who have already paid 
off their student loans. 
Yet you don’t have to take CHUCK 
GRASSLEY’s word for it. Prominent 
Democratic economist Larry Summers 
has said that student debt cancelation 
would be ‘‘regressive, uncertainty cre-
ating, untargeted and inappropriate at 
a time when the economy is [already] 
overheated.’’ 
Windfall profit taxes and price con-
trols may be the worst of all of the pro-
posals. 
That should have been learned from 
the Nixon administration when he 
froze prices and wages. It was a dis-
aster—part of the cause of the great in-
flation of the 1970s. There were disas-
trous consequences then as a result of 
what happened in the 1970s. Anyone 
who lived through that time can tell 
you how these policies made things 
worse by reducing supply. The result 
was of rampant shortages, most nota-
bly with gas lines all around the block. 
When addressing inflation, Congress 
must be guided by the principle: First, 
do no harm. The Democrats’ proposal 
has failed this principle miserably. 
The fact of the matter is that, once 
the inflation fire gets started, it is 
hard to put out. Just think: Just a few 
months ago, inflation was transitory, 
and then it got up to 6 percent, 7 per-
cent, 8.3 percent. Then somebody said 
last month that it was going to cool 
off, but it is up to 8.6 percent. The Fed-
eral Reserve is best suited for reining 
in inflation given its control over the 
money supply. 
As Milton Friedman said: 
Inflation is always and everywhere a mone-
tary phenomenon. 
This doesn’t mean Congress is help-
less when it comes to responding to in-
flation. The most important thing that 
Congress can do is stop spending like 
drunken sailors. Even better would be 
to trim the budget to eliminate unnec-
essary spending. 
Congress can also provide targeted 
inflation relief. However, it must be 
done in a way that won’t add to our 
growing debt or further fuel the flames 
of inflation. One way to do this is by 
providing targeted inflation relief that 
incentivizes and rewards taxpayers who 
save rather than spend. 
With today’s high inflation, many in 
the middle class could see most or even 
all of their savings and investment 
gains wiped out by the inflation that is 
upon us. Yet, even though middle class 
savers may be losing money in real 
terms, they are still taxed on all gains 
and interest income as if inflation 
doesn’t exist. This creates a perverse 
incentive that encourages taxpayers to 
consume today rather than to save 
today. This can push up the demand for 
goods and services, forcing prices high-
er and further fueling inflation. 
To help counter the current bias in 
favor of consumption, I now come to 
my proposal, a proposal subjecting 
most middle class savings and invest-
ment income to zero tax. 
Now, this isn’t a silver bullet in the 
fight against inflation. Ultimately, the 
Federal Reserve will have to do the 
heavy lifting. However, unlike counter-
productive Democrat policies, my pro-
posals would incentivize and reward 
saving. As a result, it would get relief 
to the middle class without further 
fueling consumer demand or reducing 
production and supply. 
The title of the bill is the ‘‘Middle- 
Class Savings and Investment Act.’’ 
Under that bill, taxpayers in the 22- 
percent individual income tax bracket 
and lower would pay zero tax on their 
long-term capital gains and dividend 
income. Moreover, my proposal would 
allow individuals to exclude a reason-
able amount of interest income from 
tax. For 2022, the combination of those 
proposals means an individual with a 
taxable income of below $89,075 or a

married couple below $178,150 would 
largely be able to save tax-free. 
In addition to exempting the middle 
class from the tax on most of their sav-
ings and investment income, my pro-
posal would enhance and expand the 
saver’s credit. This provides a tax cred-
it to low- to middle-income taxpayers 
who contribute to a tax-favored retire-
ment account. My proposal would in-
crease the maximum credit amount by 
$500 for married taxpayers and expand 
eligibility to more taxpayers. 
Finally, my proposal would address a 
massive 
marriage 
penalty 
that 
is 
gradually catching ever more tax-
payers by surprise thanks just simply 
to inflation. Under ObamaCare, Demo-
crats imposed a new 3.8-percent tax on 
investment income of taxpayers earn-
ing over $200,000 single or $250,000 mar-
ried. Congress never indexed these 
thresholds for inflation; thus, given 
current inflation, it is likely it won’t 
be long before millions of middle-class 
taxpayers find themselves squarely 
within the grasp of that marriage pen-
alty. To prevent this, I index the in-
come threshold for this tax to infla-
tion. Moreover, I eliminate the mar-
riage penalty by raising the threshold 
for married taxpayers to twice that for 
single earners. 
Of course, any relief provided must 
be fully paid for to ensure that we 
aren’t just adding unsustainable debt 
and deficits. This is why my proposal is 
fully paid for by extending the $10,000 
cap on State and local tax deductions 
beyond the current scheduled expira-
tion at the end of 2025. 
The SALT deduction is a highly re-
gressive tax subsidy that primarily 
benefits high-income taxpayers. Ac-
cording to the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation, more than half of 
the benefits from lifting the SALT cap 
would go to those making over $1 mil-
lion a year. Extending the current cap 
on SALT—an otherwise highly regres-
sive tax benefit—to provide immediate 
inflation relief to the middle class 
should be a no-brainer to all of my col-
leagues. 
I urge Members on both sides of the 
aisle to support this proposal.

SENATE RESOLUTION 670—ENCOUR-
AGING THE SECRETARY OF THE 
AIR FORCE TO DESIGNATE THE 
MAINE 
AIR 
NATIONAL 
GUARD 
101ST AIR REFUELING WING AS 
A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR 
ADDITIVE 
MANUFACTURING 
TECHNOLOGY 
Mr. KING (for himself and Ms. COL-
LINS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 670 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing is 
home to four technicians certified to print 
airworthy parts, two-thirds of the entire uni-
formed force of certified technicians; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing is 
the only Air National Guard unit capable of 
printing airworthy parts, while also fielding 
the technicians certified to print airworthy 
parts; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing has 
created eight different tools for six different 
maintenance shops, enhancing aircrew main-
tenance efficiency and increasing aircraft 
readiness; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing has 
modeled and provided three training aids al-
lowing complete comprehensive drill status 
guardsmen training, resulting in increased 
technician competency, and superior aircraft 
maintenance repairs; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing has 
the ability to model and prove a well-fitting 
part before machining, allowing for easier 
identification of errors, and preventing the 
duplication of non-usable parts, increasing 
aircraft readiness and reducing material 
waste and cost; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing is 
the only Air National Guard unit to have an 
authorized polymer printer in their posses-
sion; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing part-
ners with the University of Maine Advanced 
Structures and Composites Department; 
Whereas this allows both organizations to 
share the best practices and emerging tech-
nologies, while also allowing the 101st to per-
form strength testing of part candidates and 
receive feedback for redesign options; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing has 
created five jigs or fixtures which signifi-
cantly aid aircrews in making repairs, while 
also decreasing aircraft downtime and repair 
inaccuracy; 
Whereas the 101st Air Refueling Wing has 
modeled five aircraft parts as proofs of de-
sign before machining replacement parts, 
successfully identifying model errors and re-
ducing material waste and cost; and 
Whereas the Army Reserve 75th Innovation 
Command requested that the 101st Air Re-
fueling Wing model and produce five parts as 
a pilot program connecting units with addi-
tive manufacturing stations capable of sup-
porting modeling and printing requests: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate encourages the 
Secretary of the Air Force to designate the 
Maine Air National Guard 101st Air Refuel-
ing Wing at Bangor Air National Guard Base 
as a center of excellence for additive manu-
facturing technology.

Mr. MORAN, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mr.

Mr. INHOFE, Mr. HOEVEN, and Mr. LEE) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 671 
Whereas on June 14, 1777, the Continental 
Congress approved the design of a flag of the 
United States; 
Whereas, over the years, the flag of the 
United States has preserved the standards of 
the original design comprised of alternating 
red and white stripes accompanied by a 
union consisting of white stars on a field of 
blue; 
Whereas, on May 30, 1916, President Wood-
row Wilson issued Presidential Proclamation 
1335, an announcement asking the people of 
the United States to observe June 14 as Flag 
Day; 
Whereas, on August 3, 1949, President 
Harry Truman signed into law House Joint 
Resolution 170, 81st Congress, a joint resolu-
tion designating June 14 of each year as Flag 
Day; 
Whereas, on August 21, 1959, President 
Dwight Eisenhower issued Executive Order 
10834 (24 Fed. Reg. 6865), an order estab-
lishing the most recent design of the flag of 
the United States; 
Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance was writ-
ten by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister, 
and first published in the September 8, 1892, 
issue of The Youth’s Companion; 
Whereas, in 1954, Congress added the words 
‘‘under God’’ to the Pledge of Allegiance; 
Whereas, for more than 60 years, the 
Pledge of Allegiance has included references 
to the United States flag, to the United 
States having been established as a union 
‘‘under God’’, and to the United States being 
dedicated to securing ‘‘liberty and justice for 
all’’; 
Whereas, in 1954, Congress believed it was 
acting constitutionally when it revised the 
Pledge of Allegiance; 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
principles of religious freedom by the Found-
ers, many of whom were deeply religious; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States embodies prin-
ciples intended to guarantee freedom of reli-
gion through the free exercise thereof and by 
prohibiting the Government from estab-
lishing a religion; 
Whereas patriotic songs, engravings on 
United States legal tender, and engravings 
on Federal buildings also contain general 
references to ‘‘God’’; 
Whereas, in Elk Grove Unified School Dis-
trict v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004), the Su-
preme Court of the United States overturned 
the decision of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Newdow v. 
U.S. Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th Cir. 2003), a 
case in which the Ninth Circuit concluded 
that recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance 
by a public school teacher violated the Es-
tablishment Clause of the First Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently con-
cluded that— 
(1) the previous opinion of that court in 
Newdow v. U.S. Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th 
Cir. 2003) was no longer binding precedent; 
(2) case law from the Supreme Court of the 
United States concerning the Establishment 
Clause of the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States had subse-
quently changed after the decision in Elk 
Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 542 
U.S. 1 (2004); and 
(3) Congress, in passing the new version of 
the Pledge of Allegiance, had established a 
secular purpose for the use of the term 
‘‘under God’’; and 
Whereas, in light of those conclusions, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit upheld the recitation of the Pledge of 
Allegiance by public school teachers: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 245th anniversary of the 
creation of the flag of the United States; 
(2) recognizes that the Pledge of Allegiance 
has been a valuable part of life for the people 
of the United States for generations; and 
(3) affirms that the Pledge of Allegiance is 
a constitutional expression of patriotism, 
and strongly defends the constitutionality of 
the Pledge of Allegiance.

672—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF MAY 2022 AS 
‘‘STROKE AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. LUJA´ N (for himself, Mr. BRAUN, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and Mr. RUBIO) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 672 
Whereas stroke, also known as a cerebro-
vascular accident, is an acute neurological 
injury that occurs when the blood supply to 
a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in 
the artery or a burst of the artery; 
Whereas stroke is a medical emergency 
that can cause permanent neurological dam-
age, or even death, if not promptly diagnosed 
and treated; 
Whereas, in the United States, stroke is 
now the fifth leading cause of death; 
Whereas, in the United States, someone 
has a stroke every 40 seconds, and someone 
dies of stroke every 3.5 minutes; 
Whereas approximately 795,000 people in 
the United States have a stroke each year; 
Whereas the stroke-related costs in the 
United States came to nearly $53,000,000,000 
between 2017 and 2018, including the cost of 
healthcare 
services, 
medicines 
to 
treat 
stroke, and missed days of work; 
Whereas stroke is a leading cause of seri-
ous long-term disability; 
Whereas those disabilities may require on-
going physical, occupational, speech-lan-
guage, and other therapy and surgeries; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention advises that the most effec-
tive stroke treatments are available only if 
the stroke is recognized and diagnosed with-
in 3 hours of the first symptoms and rec-
ommends the public be familiar with and use 
the mnemonic F.A.S.T. to identify the signs 
and symptoms of stroke; 
Whereas the F.A.S.T. mnemonic describes 
the symptoms of stroke, the methods for as-
sessing those symptoms, and the actions to 
take in response to those symptoms and 
stands for— 
(1) face drooping, observable when the per-
son smiles and one side of the face droops; 
(2) arm weakness, observable when both 
arms are raised and one arm drifts down-
ward; 
(3) speech difficulty, observable when ask-
ing the person to repeat a simple phrase and 
the speech is slurred or strange; and 
(4) time to call 9–1–1, if any of these symp-
toms are present; and 
Whereas the permanent health concerns 
and treatments resulting from stroke have a 
considerable impact on children, families, 
and society: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 2022 as 
‘‘Stroke Awareness 
Month’’ 
to 
increase 
awareness and education so that people in 
the United States know their risk factors 
and obtain treatment early; 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to support the efforts, programs, serv-
ices, and advocacy of organizations that 
work to enhance public awareness of stroke; 
and 
(3) encourages continued coordination and 
cooperation between government, research-
ers, families, and the public to improve prog-
noses by increasing access to timely treat-
ments for individuals who suffer strokes.

DEMOCRACY 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
RISCH) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 674 
Whereas, after World War II, the infra-
structure, factories, and cities of Europe 
were in ruins and the people of Europe were 
in danger of famine and destitution; 
Whereas, in a commencement address on 
June 5, 1947, at Harvard University, then- 
Secretary of State George C. Marshall pro-
posed the framework of the Economic Recov-
ery Program (commonly known as the ‘‘Mar-
shall Plan’’); 
Whereas, in his address, Secretary Mar-
shall declared that the Marshall Plan would 
be successful only with ‘‘foresight, and a 
willingness on the part of our people to face 
up to the vast responsibility which history 
has clearly placed upon our country’’; 
Whereas a bipartisan coalition of Congress 
overwhelmingly approved the Marshall Plan 
through the passage of the Economic Co-
operation Act of 1948, which was signed by 
President Harry Truman on April 3, 1948; 
Whereas, in that Act, Congress acknowl-
edged that the ‘‘intimate economic and other 
relationships between the United States and 
the nations of Europe’’ and recognized that 
peace and general welfare on the European 
continent are in the national interest of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Marshall Plan helped rebuild 
a battered Europe, restore peace and polit-
ical 
stability, 
and 
reinforce 
democracy 
across the continent; 
Whereas, under the Marshall Plan, the 
United States extended an offer of aid to all 
countries in Europe, without prejudice, in-
cluding to the then-Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics; 
Whereas the Marshall Pan served as the 
foundation for transatlantic engagement and 
cooperation, which led to the establishment 
of the Organization for Economic Coopera-
tion and Development (OECD) and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); 
Whereas continued Euro-Atlantic integra-
tion and cooperation are key to the protec-
tion of peace and transatlantic values; 
Whereas the brutal and unprovoked inva-
sion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin, launched 
on February 24, 2022, threatens the peace and 
principles at the core of the transatlantic 
community; 
Whereas continued transatlantic coopera-
tion is vital to holding Vladimir Putin to ac-
count for his war of choice against the 
Ukrainian people, and supporting Ukraine as 
it defends its sovereignty and territorial in-
tegrity amidst unconscionable war crimes 
committed by the Armed Forces of the Rus-
sian Federation; 
Whereas the United States, in cooperation 
with its allies and partners, is committed to 
helping rebuild and protect the democratic 
Government of Ukraine; 
Whereas direct investment in the United 
States by European countries exceeds tril-
lions of dollars annually, which is a direct 
result of the prosperous economy in Europe 
that was aided by investments of the United 
States; and 
Whereas the German Marshall Fund of the 
United States, which celebrates its 50th an-
niversary in 2022, was established with a gift 
from Germany to express appreciation for 
the support the United States provided to 
Europe in the aftermath of World War II: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 75th anniversary of the 
Economic Recovery Program (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Marshall Plan’’); 
(2) recognizes the role of the Marshall Plan 
in founding a transatlantic community com-
mitted to the preservation of peace, pros-
perity, and democracy; 
(3) reaffirms that cooperation with allies 
and partners in the transatlantic community 
to protect shared values and principles is in 
the national interest of the United States; 
and 
(4) congratulates the German Marshall 
Fund of the United States on its 50th anni-
versary and expresses appreciation for its 
work to champion cooperation between the 
United States and allies and partners in Eu-
rope.

HONORING JAMES M. SHURE FOR 
HIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO 
THE COMMUNITY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to join Jewish 
Family Services as well as the many family, 
friends, and community leaders who have 
gathered to pay tribute to a special member of 
our community and a man I am honored to 
call my friend, James M. Shure. Better known 
as Jimmy throughout the community, he was 
born and raised in New Haven, Connecticut, 
spending a lifetime giving back to the city and 
its residents. 
Jimmy grew up in the Westville section of 
New Haven, the son of a much beloved local 
funeral director. His father, Robert, opened the 
Robert E. Shure Funeral Home on George 
Street in 1939, quickly becoming known 
throughout New Haven’s Jewish community 
for his compassion and dedication in planning 
burial services for their loved ones. As suc-
cessful as he was, Robert did not encourage 
Jimmy to follow in his footsteps and take over 
the family business—in fact, he was deter-
mined that Jimmy would not do so. Following 
his father’s advice, Jimmy sought to follow an-
other path, attending college and graduate 
school where he earned an advanced degree 
in English Literature. 
Shortly after completing his Ph.D., Jimmy 
found himself harkening back to his childhood 
memories of overhearing the late-night and 
weekend phone conversations when dis-
traught families called his father to seek help 
and reassurance. He recalled friends telling 
him about the important role Robert had 
played in honoring others’ lives. He knew his 
dad’s work mattered and soon realized that he 
would much rather serve the community than 
teach in a classroom. So, despite his father’s 
initial disappointment, Jimmy attended mor-
tuary school and began working at the family 
funeral home, taking over the day-to-day oper-
ations when Robert retired in 1975. For nearly 
five decades, Jimmy has helped families navi-
gate one of the most difficult of life’s trials— 
saying goodbye—ensuring that the time-hon-
ored customs and traditions of the Jewish faith 
are kept with understanding and comfort. 
Jimmy’s compassion and support of the 
community goes beyond his professional life. 
He also dedicates his time and energies to 
strengthening the reach and capabilities of 
non-profit organizations like Jewish Family 
Services. He understands the difference they 
can make in the lives of others and has made 
it a personal mission to ensure that these or-
ganizations have the resources necessary to 
meet the needs of the community. 
In the Jewish tradition, it is taught that one 
should give tzedakah because they want to, 
not because they have to and that everyone 
has a responsibility to help those suffering 
from poverty. Through his professional work 
as well as his personal philanthropy, Jimmy 
has exemplified that lesson, setting a standard 
of generosity to which we should all strive. At 
this evening’s annual Spring celebration, a 
yearly event that marks the renewed commit-
ment of the organization to its mission, Jewish 
Family Services is honoring Jimmy for his 
dedicated service. I am honored to join them 
in extending my heartfelt thanks and sincere 
appreciation to James M. Shure for all of his 
good work on behalf of our community. Mazel 
Tov.

HONORING DALE MOORE 
HON. TRACEY MANN 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a great Kansan, Dale Moore, and to 
congratulate him on his retirement from a ca-
reer of dedicated service to farmers, ranchers, 
and agricultural producers. 
Dale grew up on a livestock, hay, and grain 
farm in Copeland, KS, which lies in my dis-
trict—the Big First. He went to Fort Hays State 
University, worked for Kansas Pork Producers 
Council, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Asso-
ciation, and Senator Pat Roberts. In 2001, 
President Bush appointed Dale to serve as the 
Chief of Staff at USDA, after which he served 
as the Legislative Director for the House Agri-
culture Committee. Most recently, Dale has 
been serving as Executive Vice President at 
the American Farm Bureau Federation, where 
his presence will be deeply missed. 
Dale has tirelessly advocated for agriculture 
for more than 40 years, and he never forgot 
his southwest Kansas roots or the values he 
learned there: hard work, others before self, 
and personal responsibility. I am grateful for 
Dale’s leadership and service, and I offer him, 
his wife Faith, and their family my best wishes 
as they begin this new adventure. Congratula-
tions to Dale.

HONORING AND CELEBRATING THE 
230TH ANNIVERSARY OF JEFFER-
SON COUNTY, TENNESSEE 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the historic celebration of 
Jefferson County’s 230th anniversary. On 
June 11, 1792, Governor William Blount, by 
ordinance formed Jefferson County, originally 
a part of North Carolina. Later, when Ten-
nessee became a state in 1796, Jefferson 
County became a part of the state and three 
other counties have since been fanned out of 
the original land of Jefferson County. 
On July 23, 1792, the first County Court of 
Jefferson County was organized at the home 
of Jeremiah Mathews, and the county court 
selected a distinguished committee to locate a 
county seat which became Dandridge, in 
honor of President George Washington’s wife, 
Martha Dandridge Custis Washington; Amer-
ica’s first, First Lady. 
The famed frontiersman Davy Crockett 
found his way to Jefferson County and in 1806 
was married to Polly Finley at the Finley’s 
homeplace after meeting at a harvest dance 
and the folk hero sold his rifle in 1806 to post 
a marriage bond. He and Polly had two chil-
dren while in Jefferson County and lived here 
until 1811. Davy Crockett also served two 
terms in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, from 1827 to 1831. 
This beautiful county is nestled at the foot-
hills of the Great Smoky Mountains and is 
home to 2 TVA lakes and both Cherokee Dam 
and Douglas Dam were built in record time to 
support the WWII emergency. 
Home to Carson-Newman University, Bush 
Beans, the world’s largest supplier of baked 
beans, along with many other notable busi-
nesses and industries, century farms, and five 
incorporated 
cities 
or 
towns 
including 
Dandridge, Jefferson City, New Market, White 
Pine, and Baneberry. Jefferson County is 
home of the Patriots of Jefferson County High 
School in beautiful Dumplin Valley and con-
tinues to be a great place to live, work, and 
raise a family.

HONORING THE LIONS CLUB OF 
NEW HAVEN ON THEIR CENTEN-
NIAL ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise today to extend my 
very best wishes to the members of the New 
Haven Lions Club as they gather to celebrate 
the 100th Anniversary of this extraordinary 
community organization. Over the course of its 
history, the New Haven Lions Club has en-
abled its members to contribute to our com-
munity in a positive and meaningful way. In-
deed, in the last century, members of the New 
Haven Lions Club have helped to shape the 
very character of our community. 
Founded in February of 1922, the New 
Haven Lions Club was only the second such 
club started in New England. From the very 
beginning, member’s work in the community 
concentrated on assistance to local blind per-
sons and underprivileged children. In its ear-
liest years, Lions would repair radios for the 
blind and transport them to and from local 
meetings as well donate dinners and presents 
to needy families during the holidays. Over 
time, the Lions club has expanded both its 
membership and its activities on behalf of 
those in need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

June 14, 2022 
Today, the New Haven Lions Club can be 
very proud of the invaluable contributions their 
members have made both through their efforts 
to not only assist the blind, the founding mis-
sion of the Lions, but in the many ways they 
make a difference in our community. From 
Camp Cedarcrest, a forty-two-acre facility lo-
cated in Orange, Connecticut that began its 
operations in 1928 and provides a recreational 
space to thousands of young people and 
adults each summer season to their participa-
tion in Pediatric and Adult Screening events, 
Special Olympics ‘‘Opening Eyes’’, Veterans 
Stand Down, and bell ringing on behalf of the 
Salvation Army, New Haven Lions are improv-
ing the quality of life for countless members of 
our community. 
Over the course of their one-hundred-year 
history, New Haven Lions have raised and dis-
tributed over $950,000 to assist the blind and 
have participated in service activities that have 
benefitted those with diabetes, the physically 
and mentally challenged, and the hearing im-
paired. Their members have focused their time 
and energies on working to address environ-
mental issues, improve community welfare, 
and promote international understating. Orga-
nizations like the Fidelco Guide Dog Founda-
tion, CT Radio Information System, the CT 
Food Bank, Columbus House, Clifford Beers, 
and the Ronald McDonald House are just a 
few of the local service organizations who 
have benefitted from their generosity and dedi-
cation. 
The New Haven Lions have had an extraor-
dinary impact on our community, and we can-
not thank them enough for all of their good 
work. As they celebrate their 100th anniver-
sary, I am proud to stand to congratulate them 
on this remarkable milestone and to extend 
my deepest thanks and appreciation to mem-
bers past and present for their outstanding ef-
forts on behalf of our community. I have no 
doubt that they will continue to do so for many 
more years to come.

ethic. I am proud to see them represent Win-
nebago so well throughout the state and the 
country with their talent and passion. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Owen, Supreme, Eden and Michael that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to again formally congratulate Owen Light-
foot, Supreme Muhammad, Eden Trotter- 
Krahn and Michael Cunningham for their state 
title in the 4x100 meter relay and 4x200 meter

RECOGNIZING THE HAYWARD 
ROTARY CLUB 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Hayward Rotary Club, which will 
celebrate 100 years of serving the Hayward 
community on Thursday, June 23, 2022. 
Hayward Rotary, of which I’m a proud mem-
ber, was founded in the early 1920s when 
Hayward business owners regularly started to 
meet for lunch. Believing Hayward needed a 
service club, they petitioned their local Rotary 
District for sponsorship, and on June 23, 
1922, Hayward Rotary was established. 
Hayward Rotary’s first official action as a 
club was to sponsor the local Boy Scouts 
troop. During the Great Depression, the club 
partnered with the Lions and 20 to 30 clubs to 
create an annual Halloween party at the Hay-
ward Plunge to provide a safe place for chil-
dren to have fun. They also initiated an annual 
Christmas party for underprivileged children. 
During World War II, the club sent clothing 
and goods to war-torn regions in Europe and 
helped finance and staff listening posts in the 
Hayward Hills. 
In 1957, Hayward Rotary funded benches at 
Hayward bus stops, many of which are still in 
use today. At that same time, the club helped 
develop Interact Clubs at Hayward high 
schools to instill the importance of service into 
the next generation. They also created ‘‘Let’s 
Go Fishing,’’ an annual picnic for disabled chil-
dren in the community. Recognizing the impor-
tance of community spaces, they supported 
the construction of the Tea House in Hayward. 
Honoring their commitment to supporting inter-
national causes, the club oversaw the ship-
ment of 75 tons of textbooks to schools in 
Pakistan in 1974 and began their Polio Plus 
Program in the 1980s. 
In 1990, the club officially incorporated the 
Hayward Rotary Foundation to help fund com-
munity programs. From 1994 to 1995, the club 
supported the construction of The Silva Pedi-
atric Clinic, a full-service pediatric facility, and 
later expanded to add a full-service dental 
clinic. 
In celebration of its 75th anniversary, Hay-
ward Rotary partnered with the Hayward Uni-
fied School District to create the Hayward 
Community Technology Center at the Hay-
ward Adult Education School in 1994. In 1999 
they created the Newmann Park in the heart 
of downtown to replace an empty lot left by a 
building fire. The club also carried out its 
‘‘Field of Dreams’’ project to improve lighting, 
provide scoreboards, and update facilities at 
Hayward high schools. In 2003, the club start-
ed its annual ‘‘Back-to-School Child Spree,’’ 
where it helped 100 children get the supplies 
needed for the upcoming school year. 
Hayward Rotary has remained one of the 
premier service clubs in Hayward. During its 
tenure, the club has contributed over $3 mil-
lion and hundreds of thousands of service 
hours to civic improvements and community 
programs in Hayward and across the globe. It 
continues to grow its Club Foundation Endow-
ment and the Rotary International Foundation 
to allow for the completion of more successful 
community service projects in the future. 
For 100 years, Hayward Rotary has been 
pivotal in developing the robust community of 
Hayward. Hayward Rotary’s accomplishments 
have truly exemplified its ‘‘Service above Self’’ 
motto. I join the club in celebrating its legacy 
and wish it many more productive years to 
come.

HONORING 
COMMUNITY 
HEALTH 
CENTER, INC. ON THE CELEBRA-
TION OF THEIR 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise today to join all of 
those gathered in congratulating the Commu-
nity Health Center, Inc. on their 50th anniver-
sary. This is a remarkable milestone for this 
outstanding organization, and I am proud to 
recognize their invaluable contributions to our 
community. 
Health care is a right, not a privilege. It is 
a simple motto and the fundamental basis of 
the establishment of Community Health Cen-
ter, Inc. Fifty years ago, a group of students 
from Wesleyan University joined with commu-
nity activists in Middletown—drawn together 
through a shared vision for affordable, acces-
sible and responsive health care—to create a 
free clinic to meet the needs of the commu-
nity. Fueled by idealism and a deep belief that 
patients should be the cornerstone of what-
ever was created, the Community Health Cen-
ter, Inc. was born. Today, five decades later, 
CHC is one of the largest Federally Qualified 
Health Centers in the nation, serving 145,000 
people in Connecticut at more than 240 loca-
tions 
Other communities were inspired by CHC’s 
ideas, and it has grown steadily, establishing 
clinics for the underserved throughout Con-
necticut, which provide comprehensive, team- 
based medical, dental, and behavioral health 
services. CHC also created school-based clin-
ics and is now the largest school-based care 
provider in Connecticut, offering medical, den-
tal and behavioral health care to children and 
making care more accessible for thousands of 
hard-working families. 
Home to the Weitzman Institute, an innova-
tive center of research, education, and policy 
development, CHC has developed and imple-
mented national training programs for Nurse 
Practitioners and Medical Assistants. CHC has 
also been a pioneer in telehealth, keeping its 
patients connected and healthy during the 
pandemic, and creating a company providing 
specialty e-consults for underserved patients. 
In 2020, as our nation faced the greatest 
health crisis in a generation, CHC got to work, 
providing care and distributing resources 
throughout the communities they serve. CHC 
provided one of the most comprehensive and 
innovative campaigns against Covid–19 in the 
country, creating testing and vaccination sites

both at drive-through mass vaccine sites and 
at stores, malls, and places of worship. CHC’s 
tireless efforts to equitably distribute the vac-
cine to all members of the community received 
national and international recognition, includ-
ing from the White House. 
CHC’s restless drive to innovate, dating 
back to the spirit of its founders in 1972, and 
its unwavering belief that healthcare is a right 
and not a privilege, has driven the organiza-
tion’s remarkable contributions in the last half 
century. I could not be more proud to join the 
Middletown community in celebrating this very 
special 
anniversary 
with 
the 
Community 
Health Center, Inc. Their outstanding dedica-
tion and commitment to ensuring, that every-
one—regardless of circumstance—has access 
to affordable, quality health care serves as an 
example to us all. I am honored to extend my 
heartfelt congratulations and very best wishes 
to President and CEO, Mark Masselli, Mar-
garet Flinter, Senior Vice President and Clin-
ical Director, and the entire CHC family on this 
very special occasion. As we say in Italian—

HONORING LUISA CANESTRI HOW-
ARD ON THE OCCASION OF HER 
RETIREMENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today during National 
Nurses Week to join the VA Connecticut 
Healthcare System in extending my heartfelt 
congratulations to Luisa Canestri Howard. 
Luisa is not only a special part of the VA Con-
necticut family, she is also one of my closest 
cousins and I am so proud to have the oppor-
tunity to recognize her for her outstanding ca-
reer in nursing. 
Luisa began her career at the West Haven 
VA in January of 1982. Luisa had a special 
place in her heart for our nation’s veterans 
and she wanted to use her talents to help im-
prove their lives and support their healthcare 
needs. Her first station was as a staff nurse 
on G 5 East which was a medical floor. She 
then moved to a staff nurse on the Medical 
ICU, then worked in Cardiology research. After 
that she became the Nurse Manager of the 
Specialty Clinics. As a staff nurse Luisa held 
certifications in Medical Surgical nursing and 
in Research Nursing. In 2007 she was award-
ed the Nightingale award for excellence in 
nursing and in 2009 she was awarded the 
VISN1 Distinguished Federal Manager Award. 
IN 2013 Luisa started her current role as 
Nurse Manager of Case Management where 
she became responsible for the day-to-day op-
erations of the unit. Luisa has provided re-
markable leadership, encouragement, and in-
struction to those who have served in her de-
partment. Her colleagues say ‘‘Luisa is a true 
veteran advocate who always does the right 
thing in every situation. She is a true mentor 
to our nurses and provides unwavering sup-
port to all members of our team and especially 
to our veterans.’’ 
For the last forty years, Luisa has dedicated 
her professional career and personal compas-
sion to nursing and providing the best possible 
care for our veterans. I can clearly remember 
my aunt talking about how she always 
dreamed of being a nurse but for many rea-
sons was unable to achieve that dream. Luisa 
became the nurse her mother always wanted 
to be, fulfilling that dream, and exceeding all 
her mother’s brightest wishes. It is so fitting 
that her retirement comes during National 
Nurses Week so that we may pay tribute to 
Luisa Canestri Howard and the remarkable ca-
reer she has led. I wish her all the best for 
many more years of health and happiness as 
she begins this new life chapter. 
HONORING DR. ALEX JOHNSON 
HON. SHONTEL M. BROWN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Alex Johnson, who will 
soon be retiring after nearly a decade of serv-
ice as Cuyahoga Community College’s Presi-
dent. 
Dr. Johnson retires a pillar of the Cleveland 
community. His deep commitment to Tri-C’s 
students 
and 
forward-thinking 
leadership 
helped shape graduates who were prepared 
for a lifetime of success in Northeast Ohio. 
After becoming President of Tri-C in 2014, 
Dr. Johnson shared his vision for pushing Tri- 
C into the future by making degree programs, 
workforce training opportunities and personal 
enrichment classes more accessible to North-
east Ohioans. As a result, Tri-C continues to 
expand opportunity through high-quality edu-
cation and skills training right here in the 
Greater Cleveland area. 
Under Dr. Johnson’s leadership, Tri-C’s 
Nursing, Creative Arts, Public Safety, Hospi-
tality Management, Information Technology 
and Manufacturing programs were reorganized 
to provide training and pathways for students 
entering some of the most in-demand career 
fields. He also spearheaded new investments 
in workforce training, like the College’s Trans-
portation Innovation Center in Euclid, as well 
as new programs aimed at uplifting those in 
low-income and distressed areas across the 
region. 
During Dr. Johnson’s tenure, Tri-C produced 
a record number of graduates and increased 
its graduation rates. It is hard to overstate the 
impact of this legacy. More students are grad-
uating from Tri-C with the skills and informa-
tion they need for a lifetime of success. Mean-
while, our workforce grows stronger thanks to 
the fact that around 85 percent of Tri-C grad-
uates stay and work in the region. 
Even in the most trying moments, Dr. John-
son’s 
leadership 
proved 
to 
be 
crucial. 
Throughout the tumult of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Dr. Johnson served as a steady hand 
at the helm, ensuring students’ continued suc-
cess. Tri-C successfully transitioned to an on 
line learning and working environment and 
scaled its technology capabilities to maintain 
the school’s promise to its students. 
Dr. Johnson oversaw an era of growth, ad-
aptation, and modernization at Tri-C, all while 
remaining committed to the school’s core mis-
sion of delivering affordable higher education, 
providing equitable job opportunities, and en-
suring successful degree completion. He 
helped to forge Tri-C into a vanguard of our 
local community and a model for community 
colleges nationwide. 
Dr. Johnson’s legacy is one of true distinc-
tion. His tenure as Tri-C president represents 
the culmination ofa 40-year career in higher 
education. Beyond his contributions in the 
classroom, Dr. Johnson has also been an ac-
tive and leading member of the Cleveland 
community. He has served on various boards, 
including the United Way of Greater Cleve-
land, Northeast Ohio Council on Higher Edu-
cation, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Mu-
seum, Ideastream, Playhouse Square, MAG-
NET, Team NEO, and the Greater Cleveland 
Partnership.

As a Tri-C graduate and the Representative 
for Ohio’s Eleventh District, I deeply appre-
ciate Dr. Johnson’s extraordinary leadership, 
unparalleled vision, and lasting accomplish-
ments. His legacy will only continue to grow 
through the countless students, teachers, and 
administrators he impacted. 
On behalf of the people of Ohio’s Eleventh 
Congressional District, I would like to thank 
Dr. Alex Johnson for his years of service as 
Tri-C’s President and congratulate him on his 
retirement.

RECOGNIZING DR. RONALD A. 
PAUL 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the thoughtful and visionary lead-
ership of Dr. Ronald A. Paul, the outgoing 
President of the Jewish Community Relations 
Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington. Dur-
ing the last two years of the pandemic, Ron’s 
compassionate and energetic leadership en-
abled the JCRC to render essential service 
not just to the Jewish Community but to the 
broader community during an excruciatingly 
hard time for so many people. Dr. Paul has 
served the people of Montgomery County, 
Maryland and beyond with relentless energy 
and enormous distinction. I am proud to be his 
Congressman and his friend. 
For decades, Dr. Paul has dedicated count-
less hours as a key member of numerous ex-
ecutive committees and boards of local and 
national non-profit organizations. He served as 
Chair of the United Jewish Endowment Fund, 
Chair of the Endowment for the Jewish Agen-
cy for Israel of North America and the boards 
of the Jewish Council for the Aging, and the 
Anti-Defamation League. 
But these commitments are not even his 
full-time job. For over four decades, Dr. Paul 
has worked as a renowned obstetrician-gyne-
cologist while serving our community in nu-
merous volunteer and leadership roles. His 
comprehensive approach to health care and 
inspirational leadership are deserving of the 
highest recognition and praise. Ron has been 
named one of Washingtonian magazine’s Top 
Doctors. 
Additionally, Dr. Paul and his loving wife, 
Toni, have dedicated themselves to serving 
survivors of the Holocaust in our community, 
and I want to give special recognition to Toni 
for founding the local Cafe´ Europa, a nation-
wide social program for survivors that has 
grown around the world since it was founded 
two decades ago. 
Holocaust 
remembrance 
and 
education 
have been near and dear to Ron during his 
term as JCRC President, along with commu-
nity security, and education and public health 
advocacy. His dedication to Maryland’s Jewish 
community serves as an example for us all of 
what it means to be an engaged American cit-
izen. I hope that the House will join me in 
celebrating Dr. Paul’s enduring contributions. 
CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SPRINGS LEARN-
ING CENTER 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, in a year 
which marks the 200th anniversary of the Do-
minican Sisters ministry in United States, the 
Dominican Sisters of Peace, who make their 
home in City of New Haven, are marking a 
special milestone—the 20th Anniversary of the 
Springs Learning Center. Over the course of 
the last two decades, the Center has become 
an invaluable resource to our community, and, 
in particular to the immigrants who have cho-
sen to make the Greater New Haven area 
their home. 
Education has always been a core compo-
nent of the work of the Dominican Sisters of 
Peace. Indeed, they have provided edu-
cational and pastoral services in New Haven 
since 1901 in elementary, secondary, and col-
lege programs. Recognizing the growing adult 
literacy and English as a Second Language 
needs in the community, the Dominican Sis-
ters opened Springs Learning Center in 2002 
to continue their educational mission in the 
Fair Haven area. 
Since opening its doors just twenty years 
ago, the Springs Learning Center has helped 
over one thousand learners improve their 
English language skills—and all with the as-
sistance of over one hundred volunteer tutors, 
come of whom have been with the Center 
since the very beginning. These dedicated tu-
tors have opened new doors of opportunity to 
those they have served, helping them to boost 
their employment and business development 
prospects, enhance their contributions to the 
community, and assist them in their pursuit of 
citizenship. 
As the child of an immigrant, I understand 
the challenges these families can face as they 
try to acclimate to a new community and a 
new country. My father, Ted DeLauro, came to 
this country as a child and when his teachers 
and fellow classmates made fun of him for not 
immediately understanding the English lan-
guage, he left school. He was just in 7th grade 
at the time. He was self-taught but never for-
got his struggles and he dedicated much of 
his time as an adult helping other Italian immi-
grants translate documents and to learn the 
language. I can remember the visible relief 
and gratitude of each person and family he 
helped—it is that same remarkable gift that 
the Dominican Sisters and the volunteers at 
the Springs Learning Center give to each im-
migrant who seeks their help. 
It is an honor for me to rise today to extend 
my sincere congratulations to the Dominican 
Sisters of Peace and the many volunteers and 
supporters of the Springs Learning Center as 
they celebrate their 20th Anniversary. My 
heartfelt thanks for their invaluable service, 
and very best wishes for many more years of 
success. 
RECOGNIZING THE ILLINI BLUFFS 
HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL TEAM 
AS IHSA CLASS 1A STATE CHAM-
PIONS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Illini Bluffs High School Soft-
ball Team as Illinois High School Association 
(IHSA) Class 1A State Champions. 
The Illini Bluffs Softball team is no stranger 
to excelling when it comes to competition. The 
team has continued the legacy of competing in 
and winning the Class 1A State Championship 
for the second year in a row. The team now 
has two titles in Class 1A and are only one of 
two teams to do so since 2010. They are also 
the only team to have had a no-hitter finish in 
a State Title game since 1999. As a former 
student athlete, I commend them for their hard 
work and dedication. 
I am incredibly proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District and the student athletes 
of Illini Bluffs High School. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to formally congratulate Illini Bluffs 
again on winning the Illinois High School As-
sociation Class 1A State Championships for 
Softball.

CHAPEL 
HAVEN 
SCHLEIFER CENTER 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to join the resi-
dents, families, administration, and supporters 
of Chapel Haven Schleifer Center as they 
mark the 50th Anniversary of this very special 
organization. 
In 1972 a group of parents who shared the 
challenges of caring for adult children with 
varying levels of social and developmental dis-
abilities banded together to try to find a solu-
tion to a common goal. As the late Jerry 
Rossman, one of the Center’s co-founders, 
once described, they wanted ‘‘a place where 
our kids could live and learn their independ-
ence and then go home.’’ Since they could not 
find an existing program to meet their needs, 
the opened the Chapel Haven Schleifer Cen-
ter as a private non-profit special needs agen-
cy. The Center was opened on Chapel Street 
in New Haven, Connecticut with 6 students, 2 
staff, and a dog.

June 14, 2022 
As word of the program’s success spread 
and enrolled adults chose to make New 
Haven their lifelong home, the agency began 
to expand and needed to move to a larger 
campus. Today, Chapel Haven Schleifer Cen-
ter occupies a flourishing campus on Whalley 
Avenue and serves over two-hundred fifty 
adults, ranging in age from eighteen to sev-
enty, who are living with Down Syndrome, au-
tism, intellectual disabilities, Asperger Syn-
drome and more. 
The program’s mission is to empower adults 
with social and developmental disabilities to 
live independent and self-determined lives. A 
new $41.5 million capital campaign has re-
sulted in state-of-the-art residential, teaching 
and community spaces, including the addition 
of a senior living facility, allowing senior mem-
bers of the community to continue to live 
among friends and with independence. 
Chapel Haven Schleifer Center has been 
recognized locally and nationally with a myriad 
of awards and commendations. The deep 
partnerships they have built within the New 
Haven community, particularly in Westville 
community which they call home, have en-
abled the Chapel Haven Schleifer Center to 
create a safe, nurturing environment where 
their clients and residents can thrive. It is my 
honor to stand today to extend my deepest 
thanks and appreciation to the dedication ad-
ministration and staff as well supporters of 
Chapel Haven for all that they do to ensure 
the success of this very special organization. 
Congratulations and Happy 50th Anniversary.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
COMMUNITY 
LEADER 
AND 
PUBLIC SERVANT SYLVIA SASS 
HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of Sylvia 
Sass, an extraordinary public servant and 
community leader in Washington State. 
Since she was young, Sylvia Sass has been 
committed to overcoming obstacles. When 
Sylvia was 15, she applied for a sales position 
at a local shoe store where the store manager 
told her that they didn’t hire women to sell 
shoes. She was given a trial period where she 
received no pay and, in the end, sold more 
shoes than the assistant manager. This same 
tenacity led Sylvia to become one of Tacoma’s 
leading figures while serving her local and na-
tional community, raising a family, and owning 
a business. 
So it was no surprise in 1956, when Taco-
ma’s Mayor needed help rebuilding inter-
national relations around the world in the after-
math of World War II, that he turned to Sylvia 
Sass. She became the mayor’s representative 
for President Eisenhower’s Town Affiliation As-
sociation, today Sister Cities International. Syl-
via was a vital player in the early development 
of the organization and was appointed Wash-
ington State Coordinator for Sister Cities Inter-
national. She attended regional meetings and 
represented SCI at annual League of Cities 
meetings with mayors from across the country. 
She was even one of twelve people selected 
as delegates to have lunch with President Ei-
senhower. To this day, she remains active as 
an honorary board member and is known as 
the First Lady of Sister Cities International. 
In addition to her work with SCI, Sylvia has 
been a dedicated community leader in Ta-
coma and Pierce County for decades, found-
ing the Lakewood Alacoma Club, a non-profit 
center for recovering alcoholics, receiving a 
volunteer award from the National Association 
for Mental Illness, and serving on the Univer-
sity Place Parks and Recreation Commission. 
In 2011, as former Tacoma Mayor, I declared 
March 1 as Sylvia B. Sass Day to recognize 
the amazing service and work she has done 
for the city of Tacoma. 
Madam Speaker, Sylvia Sass exemplifies 
hard work, perseverance, and selfless service 
to others. She is a deeply respected member 
of our community and has profoundly im-
pacted her region, country, and the world for 
decades. I am proud to call her my friend.

HONORING JUNETEENTH AS A 
NATIONAL HOLIDAY 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the upcoming Juneteenth Na-
tional Holiday, a day in which we celebrate the 
freedom of African Americans. 
On January 1, 1863, President Abraham 
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, 
proclaiming freedom for more than 3.5 million 
enslaved African Americans. On June 19, 
1865, more than two years later, enslaved 
Americans in Galveston, Texas, received the 
notice from U.S. General Gordon Granger that 
stated, ‘‘The people of Texas are informed 
that, in accordance with a proclamation from 
the Executive of the United States, all slaves 
are free.’’ In 1866, black Americans celebrated 
the first of many annual celebrations of 
Juneteenth on June 19. Beginning with a proc-
lamation in 1938 and legislation in 1979, 
Texas became the first state to make 
Juneteenth an official holiday. More than half 
of the United States have, in recent years, 
recognized Juneteenth in some capacity, in-
cluding Georgia. I have been a part of this 
celebration for the past several years, speak-
ing at local ceremonies; and I appreciate the 
history of this commemoration. 
I further believe it is important to celebrate 
freedom and liberty at every opportunity, 
which is why I supported S. 475, Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act, when it came 
up for a vote in Congress in 2021. This na-
tional holiday is a celebration of freedom, and 
should be recognized by all Americans; as 
well as a day where we remember the moral 
stain that slavery had on our country. On be-
half of the 11th Congressional District, and the 
United States House of Representatives, I join 
others throughout America in recognizing the 
freedom and individual liberty that Juneteenth 
represents. 
HONORING 
IRWIN 
GARFINKEL, 
PHD. ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 
RETIREMENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to join family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my very 
best wishes to Dr. Irwin Garfinkel on the occa-
sion of his retirement. To say that he has left 
an indelible mark does not do justice to the 
impact that his professional contributions as a 
social worker and economist have made over 
the course of his career. There is no one that 
has done more to bring to the forefront of pub-
lic debate the realities of poverty and its im-
pact on families, children, and our commu-
nities. Dr. Garfinkel’s volume of work has been 
extraordinary and we, as policy makers and as 
a society, have been fortunate to have bene-
fitted from his knowledge and expertise. 
In a career that has spanned more than six 
decades, Dr. Garfinkel has dedicated count-
less hours to better understanding poverty, 
wealth, and the welfare state and how they 
shape communities and societies. Some of his 
earliest work was in Wisconsin, as the director 
of the Institute for Policy Research and later 
as the principle investigator of the Wisconsin 
Child Support Study where his research on 
child support and welfare helped to shape leg-
islation not only in Wisconsin, but other states, 
within the U.S. Congress, and in other coun-
tries like Great Britain, Australia, and Sweden. 
Dr. Garfinkel is also the author of over two 
hundred articles and sixteen books or edited 
volumes on poverty, income transfers, pro-
gram evaluation, single-parent families and 
child support, and the welfare state. In fact, 
his book ‘‘Wealth and Welfare States: Is 
America Laggard or Leader’’ and paper ‘‘Wel-
fare State Myths and Measurement’’ take on 
widespread mistruths about poverty and the 
poor. Dr. Garfinkel went on to become a co- 
founding director of the Center on Poverty and 
Social Policy and spent decades at Columbia 
University where he was the Mitchell I. 
Ginsberg Professor of Contemporary Urban 
Problems and the co-founding director of the 
Columbia Population Research Center—the 
only such center to be funded by the National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment to have been founded within a school of 
social work. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Garfinkel has 
demonstrated a remarkable commitment to not 
only combatting poverty, but to understanding 
its sources—to look at the root causes and 
then look at how social and public policy could 
help families to break its cyclical nature. I 
have a deep respect and admiration for the 
work he has done. 
I want to extend a special note of thanks to 
Dr. Garfinkel for the guidance and counsel he 
has given to me over the years, particularly 
with my work on expanding the child tax cred-
it. That single public policy lifted half of Amer-
ican children out of poverty, and it did so be-
cause of the foundation of research and study 
that Irv provided. Passed and signed into law 
as part of the American Rescue Plan, we wit-
nessed the economic benefit this policy had 
for families—especially the poor—and that is 
why we must continue the effort to make the 
expanded child tax credit permanent.

commitment to ending poverty—from the re-
search centers he has founded to his unparal-
leled catalog of work—will most certainly stand 
as a legacy that will continue to inspire new 
generations of social workers, economists, 
policy makers and advocates. It is with my 
deepest thanks and appreciation that I rise

Dr. Irwin Garfinkel on his retirement, and wish 
him many more years of health and happiness

RECOGNITION OF THE EGYPT-U.S. 
PARTNERSHIP 
HON. C. A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the fruitful United 
States-Egypt partnership. The year 2022 
marks 100 years of diplomatic relations be-
tween our two nations. As co-chair of the U.S. 
House of Representatives’ Friends of Egypt 
Caucus, I believe it is of paramount impor-
tance that we commemorate this partnership 
rooted in shared commitments to peace, sta-
bility and prosperity. As such, I include in the 
RECORD this Newsweek article, entitled ‘‘Let’s 
Continue to Strengthen the Egypt-U.S. Part-
nership’’ published on April 18, 2022, and 
penned by Ambassador of Egypt to the United 
States, Mr. Motaz Zahran. In this piece, Am-
bassador Zahran details how cooperation be-
tween the U.S. and Egypt has bolstered multi-
lateral support for Ukraine, strengthened 
counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and 
enabled COVID–19 care to reach vulnerable 
populations. 
As President Joe Biden and leaders on Cap-
itol Hill manage the geopolitical crisis in 
Ukraine, the Egypt-U.S. national security 
partnership recently came into the national 
spotlight. In the U.S. Congress, an over-
whelming majority of U.S. decision makers 
once again recognized the importance of 
strategic allies such as Egypt and approved 
the sale of aircrafts and military hardware 
that will allow Egypt and the U.S. to under-
take missions in the interests of both coun-
tries, working toward achieving stability in 
the Middle East and North Africa. 
This latest sale debated in Congress spe-
cifically concentrated on C-130 military 
transport airplanes. Egypt already possesses 
a fleet of those airframes previously ob-
tained from the U.S. However, like all mili-
tary hardware, those airplanes have a shelf 
life and need constant refurbishment and re-
placement. It is therefore logical to be look-
ing at our partners in the U.S. for that, espe-
cially given the central role the C-130 plays 
in our common interests. 
Egyptian C-130s carried 35,000 Egyptian 
troops to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 
American troops liberating Kuwait during 
the 1990s. In 2003, the same fleet carried an 
Egyptian field hospital to Bagram airbase in 
Afghanistan, providing medical services to 
both the alliance personnel as well as Afghan 
people. The fleet of C-130 have carried Egyp-
tian peacekeepers deployed to some of the 
most dangerous hotspots in the world at a 
great danger to themselves, and unfortu-
nately with several causalities including 
most recently in Mali a few short weeks ago. 
The C-130s have also allowed us to provide 
urgently needed humanitarian assistance to 
disaster zones in Sudan, Somalia and deliver 
masks and personal protection gears to the 
U.S. medical community during the worse 
days of the outbreak of COVID–19. We hope 
to do more as we replenish our fleet. But 
those aircrafts are not the only fruits of co-
operation between our two militaries. 
The Egyptian military is also actively in-
volved in supporting the safe passage of U.S. 
naval vessels through the Suez Canal. One of 
our core responsibilities is to safeguard navi-
gation in the Suez Canal—through which 12 
percent of global trade flows. Our commit-
ment to providing maritime security extends 
to the Mediterranean and Red Seas, where 
we actively work with partners to safeguard 
the flow of commerce. 
The depth of the Egypt-U.S. military part-
nership is exemplified by Exercise Bright 
Star, which witnesses hundreds of U.S. mili-
tary personnel join their Egyptian counter-
parts in what is regarded as the most signifi-
cant biennial military exercise in the Middle 
East and Mediterranean region. Egypt, the 
U.S. and our allies are ready to respond 
swiftly to crises in the region together be-
cause of these exercises. 
Egypt has committed itself to being a se-
cure and stable country despite the turmoil 
in nearby states. The Egyptian military has 
been successful in fighting terrorist off-
shoots of ISIS and acts as a deterrent force 
against would-be aggressors. Civil conflict 
has plagued Yemen, Syria and Libya while 
Egypt remains a stable and prosperous coun-
try. Moreover, our stability and security has 
enabled us to play a leading role in pushing 
for elections in Libya and calling for the ex-
pulsion of foreign mercenaries who only 
cause chaos and suffering. 
The Egyptian government has taken sub-
stantial strides to advance and promote 
human rights. In the past few months, Egypt 
launched its first ever National Strategy for 
Human Rights, a blueprint that puts forward 
a comprehensive approach to advance human 
rights. Laws advancing women’s rights and 
providing opportunities for their equal par-
ticipation in civic society have been intro-
duced—we are moving forward and setting an 
example for the region. The State of Emer-
gency, which was necessary to quell ter-
rorism in the country, has been suspended. 
This is in large part due to the successful co-
operation between Egypt and the U.S. in dis-
rupting terrorist networks on our borders. 
New laws that facilitate the work of local 
and foreign NGOs operating in Egypt, as well 
as moves to promote religious freedom, will 
build a pluralistic civil society that is secure 
and stable for all Egyptians. Egypt’s rock- 
solid commitment to its people resonates 
and reverberates at each crossroad. 
In an era of great power competition, in-
stability in Eastern Europe, tensions in the 
Indo-Pacific region and proliferation con-
cerns in the Middle East, we welcome the bi-
partisan support of the U.S. Congress as 
work to replenish our aging military equip-

TRIBUTE TO DR. C. WARREN 
DERRICK, JR. 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Dr. C. Warren Derrick, 
Jr. Born in Mullins, SC and raised in Marion. 
Dr. Derrick was the eldest son of Helen and 
Warren Derrick, Sr. After graduating from Mar-
ion High School as president of the student 
body in 1954, he entered Wofford College 
where he was a member of Blue Key and 
President of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He grad-
uated in 1958. 
Deciding on a career in medicine, he matric-
ulated at the Medical College of South Caro-
lina, graduating in 1962. While in medical 
school, he married Ann Marie Berry of 
Spartanburg. 
After completing a rotating internship at 
Greenville Memorial Hospital, he was inducted 
into the U.S. Army as a Captain in the Medical 
Corps and stationed in Nuremberg, Germany. 
He served for 2 years as Battalion Surgeon for 
the 34th Artillery, 2nd AC. He was discharged 
in 1965 and accepted a position with Western 
Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan 
as a physician in their student health center 
for one year. In 1966, he started a 2-year pe-
diatric residency at the University of Alabama 
Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama which 
was followed by a 3-year fellowship in pedi-
atric infectious disease at the Children’s Hos-
pital of Alabama. 
Upon the completion of his fellowship, he 
was appointed Assistant Professor of Pediat-
rics. He rose to Associate Professor in 1975 
and served as Director of Outpatient Services 
at the Children’s Hospital. It was during their 
10 years in Birmingham that their 3 children 
were born. 
Dr. Derrick returned to South Carolina and 
accepted a position with Sumter Pediatrics in 
Sumter in January 1977. After 10 months in 
private practice, he was offered, and he ac-
cepted, a faculty position with the fledgling 
new medical school in Columbia as Professor 
of Pediatrics and Chair of the Department of 
Pediatrics, University of South Carolina School 
of Medicine—a position he was to hold for the 
next 29 years. 
During his tenure with Children’s Hospital 
and the medical school, he was instrumental 
in the growth and development of the pediatric 
department and establishment of the state’s 
first free-standing children’s hospital. Under 
his leadership, the department developed a 
national reputation for its educational excel-
lence and patient care. He retired in 2007. 
His many honors include distinguished 
alumni/service awards from the Children’s 
Hospital of Alabama, USC School of Medicine, 
and Wofford College; The Presidential Merit 
Award, MUSC; William Weston Distinguished 
Service Award, Department of Pediatrics, USC 
School of Medicine; and the Order of the Pal-
metto, State of South Carolina. 
He was predeceased by Ann, his wife of 58 
years. Surviving are his 3 children: Andrea 
Derrick Truitt (Chip), Hope Derrick (Marc Tur-
ner), and Scott Derrick (Melissa); six grand-
children: Abby, Shelby, and Rachel Truitt; 
Ethan and Emery Turner; and Tripp Derrick, 
all of Columbia. He is also survived by his 
brother Bill Derrick (Jo) of Myrtle Beach and 
was predeceased by his sister, Susan Derrick 
of Palatka, Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and our col-
leagues join me in celebrating the life and leg-
acy of Dr. C. Warren Derrick, Jr.

INC.—NEW HAVEN CHAPTER ON 
THE 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
THEIR 
90TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise today to extend my 
heartfelt congratulations to the New Haven 
Chapter of Girl Friends, Inc. as they celebrate 
their 90th Anniversary at their annual Ken-
tucky Derby Luncheon. The oldest African 
American female service organization in New 
Haven, the New Haven Girl Friends is a 
unique organization within our community. 
Chartered just five years after the national 
organization, the New Haven Girl Friends 
have been a center of service and community 
for African American women in our commu-
nity. Their work to promote friendship, social 
interaction, charitable and cultural activities 
has enriched our community and the lives of 
its residents. From their success in housing all 
visiting members at the organization’s 1942 
Conclave and integrating the Taft Hotel in 
downtown New Haven to their generous sup-
port of projects like the Smithsonian National 
Museum of African American History and Cul-
ture as well as the NAACP and The Girl 
Friends Fund Scholarship program, the New 
Haven Girl Friends have left an indelible mark 
on our community. 
Each year on the weekend of the Kentucky 
Derby, members gather in fellowship to raise 
funds for scholarships that are awarded annu-
ally to students throughout Greater New 
Haven and Hartford as well as to benefit local 
community-based programs, the nonprofit Girl 
Friends Fund Foundation and other initiatives 
of the New Haven Chapter. Their mission has 
been to actively engage the community and 
their goals are rooted in the understanding 
that our communities thrive when every mem-
ber contributes to its success. The members 
of the New Haven Girl Friends include some 
of our communities most prominent social ad-
vocates—many of whom dedicate both their 
professional and personal lives to public serv-
ice. These women stand as role models for us 
all, but particularly for our young people. They 
inspire us with their deep commitment to com-
munity and compassion for others. 
It is my great honor to rise today to extend 
my sincere thanks and appreciation to the 
members of the New Haven Chapter of Girl 
Friends, Inc. for their innumerable and invalu-
able contributions to our community. It is my 
honor to congratulate you on your 90th Anni-
versary and, as we say in Italian, C’ent Anni— 
to another hundred years.

Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Nicholas Patrick, a freshman

Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to congratulate James Rasmussen on 
his retirement. James has served as a strong 
community leader working on environmental, 
habitat, and community issues along the 
Duwamish River. 
My staff and I have had the pleasure of 
working with James for several years. He has 
played an important role serving his commu-

Duwamish River Community Coalition. 
James has been an extremely effective ad-
vocate for the cleanup of the Duwamish River. 
He has also been a fierce supporter of the riv-
er’s nearby communities and has served as a 
tireless and committed advocate for decades 
in our region. His efforts and dedication have 
been invaluable in support of the protection of 
the Duwamish River. His work will help to en-
sure that the river is restored for future gen-
erations. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely thank and com-
mend James Rasmussen for spending his ca-

HONORING 
RICHARD 
SMITH 
OF 
MILFORD, CONNECTICUT FOR HIS 
OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO HIS 
COMMUNITY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to join family, 
friends, and community leaders to extend my 
deepest thanks and appreciation to Richard 
Smith of Milford, Connecticut for his out-
standing and invaluable contributions to our 
community. 
A graduate of Yale University and Trinity 
College, where he majored in political science 
with concentrations in American government 
and public policy respectively, Rich has al-
ways held a firm commitment to giving back to 
his community. He sought ways in which he 
could use his passion for government and 
public policy to make a difference, enrich the 
community, and improve the quality of life for 
others. Having spent a number of his high 
school years volunteering on various local 
campaigns, he became a member of his local 
town committee where he has spent decades 
supporting local candidates and driving policy 
agendas. Dedicating his time and energies to 
the committee and its work, he took on sev-
eral leadership positions, including serving as 
its chairman for a record-breaking eighteen 
years. 
As much as politics is his passion, public 
service is the moral compass by which Rich is 
guided. He has volunteered countless hours to 
serving both the City of Milford and the State 
of Connecticut. Appointed by the Mayor, he 
has served for a number of years as a mem-
ber of the Regional Water Authority’s Rep-
resentative Policy Board which is charged with 
the appointment of the five members to serve 
on the Regional Water Authority; the approval 
of land sales, rate increases, bond sales and 
any capital project with a cost in excess of $2 
million; the appointment of the Office of Con-
sumer Affairs as well as the external auditor; 
and the ratification of the appointment of the 
chief executive officer. For the last decade he 
has served as a member of the Milford Police 
Commission, also serving as its chairman for 
several terms. In 2017, he was nominated to 
a five-year term by then Governor Dannell 
Malloy to serve on Connecticut’s Judicial Re-
view Council as one of six citizen members. 
Established in 1976, the Judicial Review 
Council is charged with investigating and act-
ing on allegations of misconduct within the 
state’s judicial system. In every facet of his 
service to the community, Rich has leveraged 
his appreciation and excitement for politics 
and government into making a real difference 
in the lives of others. 
I have had the privilege of knowing and 
working with Rich for many years now and 
consider myself fortunate to have a friend like 
him in my corner. His leadership and vision 
have left an indelible mark that will continue to 
inspire generations of new community leaders 
for years to come. I am honored to rise today 
to extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation 
to Richard Smith for his outstanding service to 
the community and his dedicated work on be-
half of others. I wish him as well as his wife, 
Michelle, and daughters Melissa, Meghan, and 
Rebecca, all the best for many more years of 
health and happiness.

Interest to Remedy the Effects of Discrimina-

and minority-owned businesses to fairly com-
pete for federal contracts and how federal 
contracting programs can respond to, address, 
and remedy the harmful effects of discrimina-
tion. 
[From the U.S. Department of Justice, May 
16, 2022] 
THE COMPELLING INTEREST TO REMEDY THE 
EFFECTS
OF
DISCRIMINATION
IN
FEDERAL 
CONTRACTING: A SURVEY
OF RECENT EVI-
DENCE—EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
On January 27, 2022, the Department of 
Justice posted a notice in the Federal Reg-
ister announcing the publication of a Depart-
ment of Justice report surveying the evi-
dence supporting the use of race- and sex- 
conscious contracting programs by the fed-
eral government in order to remedy the ef-
fects of discrimination. 
This report is third in a series created by 
the Department of Justice since the Supreme 
Court determined that federal race-conscious 
contracting programs must meet the strict 
scrutiny standard of review to survive a con-
stitutional challenge based on the Equal 
Protection Clause in Adarand Constructors, 
Inc. v. Pen˜ a, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). Each re-
port has compiled and summarized the evi-
dence of discriminatory barriers that busi-
nesses owned by women and people of color 
face that impede participation in govern-
ment contracting. Both previous reports 
have been cited in federal court as evidence 
that there is a compelling governmental in-
terest in programs that support the ability 
of businesses owned by people of color to 
compete on an equal basis. Strict scrutiny is 
the most exacting standard of review, and it 
requires, among other things, evidence sup-
porting the conclusion that such measures 
are necessary to further the compelling gov-
ernmental interest in remedying the effects 
of past and present racial discrimination. If 
a program contains affirmative measures 
based on sex, those measures are subject to 
the somewhat lower standard of inter-
mediate scrutiny. That standard demands 
that any gender-based preference be substan-
tially related to an important governmental 
objective. 
In assessing whether race- and sex-con-
scious government contracting programs 
could continue to survive heightened levels 
of judicial review, the Department of Justice 
reviewed hundreds of state and local dis-
parity studies, dozens of congressional hear-
ings and related testimony, government re-
ports on public contracting, academic and 
expert reports on public and federal con-
tracting, academic and government reports 
on financial data related to small businesses, 
and recent case law related to Equal Protec-
tion challenges to government contracting 
and grant programs. The disparity studies, 
congressional hearings, and academic re-
ports contain both quantitative and quali-
tative evidence of the persistence of dis-
crimination and its lingering effects in the 
public and private sector. 
The Department of Justice report deter-
mines that there is a strong basis in evi-
dence, both quantitative and qualitative, of 
the continued pervasiveness of discrimina-
tory barriers that impede the full and fair 
participation of businesses owned by women 
or people of color in government con-
tracting. The evidence discussed in this re-
port supports the compelling interest in the 
continued use of federal programs that con-
tain remedial measures to eliminate dis-
criminatory barriers to contracting opportu-
nities for businesses owned by minorities and 
an important state interest in the continued 
use of federal programs that contain reme-
dial measures to eliminate discriminatory 
barriers to contracting opportunities for 
businesses owned for women. 
Both the qualitative and quantitative evi-
dence shows the various ways discrimination 
hinders the ability of minority- and women- 
owned businesses to compete equitably for 
government contracts. While this discrimi-
nation can take many forms, primary obsta-
cles include: (1) discrimination limiting ac-
cess to capital; (2) discrimination by pro-
curement agencies and prime contractors, (3) 
exclusion from business networks, and (4) 
discrimination in lending and by bonding 
companies and suppliers. 
In assessing the current public contracting 
environment faced by minority- and women- 
owned businesses, the Department of Justice 
reviewed over 200 disparity studies from 
state and local jurisdictions in 34 different 
states and the District of Columbia. Dis-
parity studies are quantitative demographic 
analysis of public procurement contracting 
utilization as compared to local business 
availability categorized by the race or sex of 
the owner. The review of these studies shows 
that there continues to be substantial dis-
parities 
between 
the 
availability 
of 
minority- and women-owned businesses and 
the utilization of such businesses in state 
and local government procurement in all 
areas of the country and at all levels of pro-
curement. The overwhelming majority of 
these studies showed significant under-utili-
zation of minority- and women-owned busi-
nesses in almost every sector of public pro-
curement. The report cited to an overview of 
these disparity studies conducted by the Mi-
nority Business Development Agency in 2016, 
which found that the studies indicated sig-
nificant contracting disparities for minority 
business enterprises that were pervasive 
across different ethnic and racial groups, in-
dustries, and geographies. Shockingly, the 
median value for the observed disparities 
was just 19%, indicating that minority busi-
nesses were being utilized at less than one- 
fifth of their availability in a given market-
place. 
The report also reviewed federal govern-
ment small business contracting. In 2017, 
just 9.8% of federal spending on contracts 
went to minority-owned businesses. The 
same year, woman-owned businesses received 
only 5% of federal prime contract awards. 
Even when comparing businesses and con-
trolling for the industry in which the firm 
did business, business age, business size 
(both in terms of average number of employ-
ees and annual receipts), business form, and 
security clearance, the likelihood of minor-
ity-owned businesses receiving a federal con-
tract versus similar businesses is still lower 
than non-minority-owned businesses. 
Overwhelmingly, the disparity studies and 
reports also present evidence linking dispari-
ties in contracting to discriminatory factors. 
In the private financial sector, historic bar-
riers and private discrimination has limited 
the ability of minority business owners to 
accumulate assets and wealth. Minority- 
owned businesses are two to three times 
more likely to be denied credit, more likely 
to avoid applying for loans based on the be-
lief they will be turned down, and more like-
ly to receive smaller loans and pay higher in-
terest rates on the loans they do receive. 
Minority- and women-owned firms not only 
receive smaller loans at higher interest rates 
than firms owned by White males, but they 
also get smaller equity investments. 
In the bonding arena, both quantitative 
and qualitative evidence shows that bonding 
requirements disproportionately affect busi-
nesses owned by women or people of color. 
83% of minority- and women-owned busi-
nesses identified bonding requirements as a 
specific barrier to the ability to obtain con-
tracts. A number of recent studies show that 
minority-owned firms are significantly more 
likely to face difficulties in obtaining re-
quired bonds compared with majority-owned 
firms. 
The evidence presented in the report indi-
cates that the barriers that have impeded 
the growth and success of minority- and 
women-owned businesses continue to exist 
and that government contracting preference 
programs ameliorate the effects of public 
and private discrimination. For example, a 
2017 disparity study prepared for the Los An-
geles County Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority compared the participation of 
minority- and women-owned businesses on 
contracts that contained goals to encourage 
utilization of minority- and women-owned 
businesses as opposed to contracts that did 
not contain such goals. The results showed 
that on contracts without goals, minority- 
and women-owned firms earned only 53 cents 
on the dollar, but on contracts with goals, 
such firms earned 96 cents on the dollar—al-
most what would be expected given the 
availability of such firms in the market-
place. 
The federal government currently operates 
two main contracting programs with race 
and/or sex-conscious elements: the SBA Sec-
tion 8(a) business development program and 
the Department of Transportation Disadvan-
taged Business Enterprise program. All fed-
eral departments and major independent 
agencies participate in the SSA’s Section 
8(a) business development program, which 
offers a variety of assistance, including set- 
aside federal government contracts to so-
cially and economically disadvantaged busi-
nesses. In Fiscal Year 2019, the federal gov-
ernment awarded $30.4 billion to 8(a) firms. 
Appendices of 219 state and local disparity 
studies, 45 relevant academic and govern-
ment studies, and 28 Congressional hearings 
are included with the report. The Federal 
Register notice announcing the report may 
be found at 87 FR 4955, and the report itself 
is publicly available at the Department of 
Justice.

OF JERRY YOUNG 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Mr. Jerry Young of Ten-
nessee’s 1st Congressional District. Mr. Young 
currently serves as President of the Ten-
nessee College of Applied Technology in Mor-
ristown. He was named President in May 2017

while expanding the business to meet the 
needs of today’s consumers. With three hun-
dred acres lined with apple, peach, and pear 
trees, the Bishops continue to work hard to 
ensure the success of the orchards. 
Generation after generation, the Bishop 
family have recognized the importance of pre-
serving the natural beauty of the orchard and 
its surrounding properties. They were one of 
the first of our local farmers to initiate an inte-
grated pest management program, signifi-
cantly reducing the pesticides and chemicals 
used in the orchards. They have converted a 
parcel of their property to a solar farm, utilizing 
renewable energy to run the farm and its ac-
companying market and winery. It is through 
these kinds of innovations that Bishop’s Or-
chards remains a respected leader in Con-
necticut’s agricultural community. 
Located on the shores of the Long Island 
Sound, Bishop Orchards captures the very 
spirit of New England. Owned and operated 
by now the 6th generation of Bishops, this re-
markable family and their orchard have been 
fixtures of the Guilford community for more 
than 400 years. From the quintessential ‘‘little 
red barn’’ to the bustling market, and from the 
acres of orchards to the newest addition of 
winemaking, Bishop’s Orchards is a destina-
tion for Connecticut families. It is my honor to 
stand today to extend my heartfelt congratula-
tions to Bishop’s on their sesquicentennial an-
niversary, and as we say in Italian—C’ent 
Anni—to another hundred.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ROCKRIDGE 
HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL TEAM 
ON WINNING THE IHSA 2A STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Rockridge High School Girls 
Softball team for their win at the Illinois High 
School Association (IHSA) State Champion-
ships. 
The unbeaten Rockridge Rockets won 64 
games before competing in IHSA State Cham-
pionship game. The ladies took a chance on 
their winning streak and came back from a 4– 
0 deficit with grit and determination. The 
Rockridge Rockets are the first team in IHSA 
history to finish as undefeated State Cham-
pions in back-to-back seasons. The team 
never gave up and accomplished a goal they 
set out for themselves at the beginning of the 
season. As a former athlete, I commend their 
hard work and dedication to their team. 
The Rockets athletic success is remarkable. 
I am incredibly proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District and student-athletes. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to formally con-
gratulate the Rockridge Rockets again on win-
ning the Illinois High School Association 2A 
State Championships for Softball.
