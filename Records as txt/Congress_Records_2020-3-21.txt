PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Father, answer us speedily 
when we don’t know which way to 
turn. Guide us with Your light when we 
cannot see the way. 
Do not hide Your face from our law-
makers as they seek to do Your will,

tinue to hide us in Your pavilion. Lord, 
teach our Senators how to live in a 
way that will honor You. 
We magnify Your Name for the way 
You have preserved our Nation through 
the seasons of its existence. You have 
made us glad, for You are our light and

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
ROUNDS). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
leading 
negotiations 
on 
tax 
and 
healthcare issues as part of the third 
phase of economic relief to help work-
ers, families, and small businesses. We 
have been working through tough 
issues, and we must do it in short 
order. 
The American people need Congress 
to put partisan politics aside and pro-
vide them relief as quickly as possible 
to get the economy turned around, and 
we must demand this of ourselves as 
well. 
Our multifaceted approach includes 
recovery checks to Americans, en-
hanced unemployment insurance, and 
much 
needed 
resources 
for 
our 
healthcare system. This is just one 
piece of the Senate’s comprehensive 
package; in other words, there are a lot 
of other Senators who are working in 
separate arenas to accomplish in that 
area what I am trying to accomplish 
through the Finance Committee. 
I hope that Democrats and my col-
leagues in the House of Representa-
tives will work with us to pass our re-
lief package as quickly as possible. 
This requires all hands on deck. 
From what I just said, you might 
draw the conclusion that fighting this 
virus pandemic is going to be just a 
role for the Congress of the United 
States, as important as that role is, 
but also, as you read how people are re-
sponding, we have to thank a lot of pri-
vate large and small businesses that we 
read about that are stepping into this 
abyss that we call the pandemic. 
While we are wringing our hands— 
and we all ought to be wringing our 
hands—you read about manufacturing 
plants of different varieties all over the 
country converting production to badly 
needed hospital supplies and testing 
supplies. You not only read that in the 
United States of America but you also 
read about President Macron of France 
saying that we are in a war-like envi-
ronment—all 
joining 
together 
to 
produce these badly needed hospital 
supplies and testing supplies. You read 
about the German Chancellor calling 
unemployed people out to help with 
harvest because workers who normally 
come in can’t cross borders there. 
So we here in Washington might 
think the only reaction to the pan-
demic we are in is only something we 
can do in Congress, as important as 
that is, but it is also very important 
that we recognize that there are a lot 
of people out there in our private sec-
tor doing what entrepreneurs normally 
do—coming to the rescue—and they 
need to be thanked and recognized as 
well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1880 
March 21, 2020 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, nego-
tiations on the third phase of the 
coronavirus legislation went late into 
the night last night and will continue 
through the day today. 
I have spoken to Speaker PELOSI and 
Secretary Mnuchin several times, as 
well as President Trump, to keep them 
apprised as we continue the work 
through a number of issues. In fact, I 
just had a very good, very detailed 
phone call with Secretary Mnuchin—or 
‘‘Steve and Chuck,’’ as he prefers to 
call it. We discussed many of the out-
standing issues, and we are making 
very good progress. I have every expec-
tation that this progress will continue 
throughout the day. Democratic nego-
tiators will meet with their Republican 
counterparts throughout the day to 
continue hammering out the details. 
The Senate is here, we are working, 
and we are all eager to come to a bipar-
tisan agreement as soon as humanly 
possible. 
There are still a number of priorities 
that Democrats continue to fight for in 
the package that is now being assem-
bled. 
As I have made clear, Democrats 
have two primary goals, broadly de-
fined, in this next phase of coronavirus 
legislation. One is to address the im-
pending public health crisis head-on 
with a massive infusion of resources to 
our hospitals, our medical facilities, 
and our other public health infrastruc-
ture. The second priority is to put 
workers first. In fact, our proposal, 
which we laid out as early as Monday, 
is entitled ‘‘Workers First.’’ 
Democrats want to do as much as 
possible to prepare our healthcare sys-
tem, and we want to give Americans 
who are most immediately affected by 
the economic slowdown ample relief so 
they can weather the storm over the 
long haul. So, on healthcare, Demo-
crats are fighting for a Marshall Plan 
for our public health infrastructure. 
We need hundreds of billions of dol-
lars for ventilators, testing equipment, 
gloves, masks, ICU beds, and PPE, or 
personal protective equipment, for our 
frontline medical workers. 
I spoke to the head of the nurses 
union in New York yesterday. They are 
short of masks. These brave nurses are 
going to work, doing their job, but 
they don’t have the right equipment 
that they need. 
Money must go to our hospitals and 
our nursing homes, our community 
health centers, and our State and local 
governments. This can neither wait for 
a future bill nor a supplemental pack-
age. We need it right now, not 2 weeks 
from now. 
A senior doctor at Maimonides hos-
pital in Brooklyn, NY, wrote to me 
yesterday. Here is what the doctor 
said: 
I’m writing to you in a move of despera-
tion. Currently, we have severe shortages in 
the basic necessities needed to fight the dis-
ease and protect health care workers. Dis-
posable masks and gowns are in such short 
supply, we re-use them until they fall apart. 
We don’t have adequate supplies of sup-
portive medicines. Beds, ventilators, nurses 
and critical care doctors are also needed. We 
need a national response to this disease. 
I urge my colleagues to hear the ur-
gency and strain in this brave doctor’s 
voice, the desperation in his warning. 
If we don’t provide these resources 
right now, what is already a dire situa-
tion 
will—not 
could—become 
cata-
strophic. It will affect hospitals every-
where: big-city hospitals, medium-sized 
suburban hospitals, and small rural 
hospitals. Many of them will go under 
in a short period of time. 
So we need a Marshall Plan for our 
public health infrastructure, and it 
must be in this legislation, in the opin-
ion of the Democratic caucus. 
As we have made clear from the be-
ginning, we must also put workers 
first. That means a dramatic expansion 
and reform of unemployment insur-
ance. We need unemployment insur-
ance on steroids. Some are calling it 
‘‘employment insurance.’’ It must be 
easier to access. It must cover many 
more Americans during this crisis, in-
cluding Americans who have nontradi-
tional employment. 
It must provide more generous bene-
fits. Workers who are laid off should re-
ceive a paycheck equal to what they 
were receiving while employed. Work-
ers must be protected, whether they 
work for businesses small, medium, or 
large. 
The plan we have would allow them 
to get unemployment insurance quick-
ly. They would be furloughed. So they 
would stay as employees—even though 
they weren’t working—of their em-
ployer, so that when, God-willing, this 
crisis ends, they can go back to their 
employer and the businesses that are 
now closed and decimated can start 
running again. 
We propose that this be not just a 
one-shot deal but a paycheck every 
work period, and it should go for as 
long as the crisis lasts. We want to 
fund it for at least 4 months, maybe 6. 
If the crisis ends more quickly, of 
course, we might be able to terminate 
it, but we need to give the workers of 
America the assurance that they will 
have paychecks. The same amount of 
resources that they had before this cri-
sis they should have now, and it will 
occur ongoing until we beat this hor-
rible disease. 
There are other things we must do 
for American families as well. We 
should greatly expand paid sick leave 
and family leave. We need to expand 
food assistance. The kids who go to 
school get their best meals, many of 
them, at the school lunch or school 
breakfast. They need to be fed. Others 
who lose work, they need food help 
right away. 
I believe our students are under 
strain. Many of their colleges are gone. 
Those who have just gotten out of 
school have difficult employment pos-
sibilities. We should cancel student 
loan payments during the course of the 
crisis, both principal and interest. 
I spoke to the President about this 
yesterday. He said he was sympathetic. 
He said at the podium yesterday that 
interest payments he would cancel, but 
I think we need to do more. 
We also must rescue small and me-
dium-sized businesses with a generous 
loan program, so long as they protect 
their workers. They have other ex-
penses. We will take care of their work-
ers under the expanded unemployment 
program and on the small business pro-
gram, but they have other expenses. 
We don’t want them going under when 
these are good, ongoing businesses that 
did nothing wrong. They have to come 
back. So small business really needs 
help. 
And, if we are going to bail out any 
industry, particularly the big compa-
nies, we have to include strict condi-
tions that put workers first: no layoffs, 
no salary cuts for workers or salary in-
creases for corporate executives, guar-
antees that workers be rehired at their 
previous wages once the crisis abates, 
and no stock buybacks. 
I have heard the President mention 
that he is against stock buybacks in 
the past. So when I called him yester-
day, I said: Make it clear. It is not in 
the bill that has been put before us, but 
Democrats will insist that it be in any 
proposal once we come together in a bi-
partisan way, as we are doing now. 
Democrats have several other prior-
ities, as well, and we are working 
through each of them with our Repub-
lican colleagues even as we speak. As I 
said, I had a wonderful—well, I had a 
very good—conversation. I will not go 
too far, but I had a very good conversa-
tion with Secretary Mnuchin, and we 
are making good progress on many of 
the issues that we Democrats feel are 
important. 
One other need, by the way—because 
we do have other needs—is that I want 
to emphasize that one of the issues 
that is quickly emerging is that State 
and local governments are running out 
of cash and may soon be broke. Gov-
ernors, 
mayors, 
county 
executives, 
county officials, town officials—Demo-
cratic and Republican alike—are clam-
oring for help. We must provide it. 
They are on the frontlines. 
So, in conclusion, I have no illusions 
about the difficulty of putting together 
legislation this momentous in this 
short a period of time, but all parties 
are working in good faith and as fast as 
possible to see that we accomplish the 
task at hand. 
Of course, far greater than our chal-
lenges here in Congress are the chal-
lenges that now confront the American 
people. Working families are at home 
without a paycheck, with no knowl-
edge of when the next one might ar-
rive. Small businesses are watching the 
labor of their lives teeter on the brink 
of collapse. 
I spoke to a small business owner. He 
had spent 8 years getting his business 
to be successful. It just had begun to be 
that way, and now his doors are closed 
and his employees are furloughed. We 
have to help people like that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1881 
March 21, 2020 
Our healthcare workers, men and 
women who perform extraordinarily 
difficult jobs even in ordinary times, 
are now asked to bear additional bur-
dens. But know this, healthcare work-
ers: You are our heroes. America 
stands with you, and Democrats are 
fighting to help every one of the emer-
gency workers during this crisis. 
So, to our healthcare workers and to 
every American out there finding their 
way through these challenging times: 
Stay strong. We are working to provide 
you the relief to see you through the 
crisis. We will get it done—Democrats, 
Republicans—together. 
Once 
the 
scourge of this virus has passed, we 
will come back stronger and even more 
resilient. 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt told 
a generation facing its own national 
crisis: 
This great Nation will endure as it [al-
ways] has endured. It will revive and it will 
prosper . . . [because there] is no unsolvable 
problem if we face it wisely and coura-
geously. 
With wisdom and with courage, we 
will endeavor to finish the job here in 
Congress—whatever it takes. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Senators’ bipartisan discussions con-
tinued all day yesterday and through 
the night. Both sides’ negotiators, with 
the administration, are continuing to 
work toward a bipartisan agreement on 
major legislation to support American 
workers and families, protect small 
businesses, help to stabilize our econ-
omy, and put more resources on the 
frontlines of our healthcare battle 
against the coronavirus. 
As of now, an agreement has yet to 
be finalized, but our committee chairs, 
their Democratic counterparts, and 
President Trump’s representatives are 
making important progress. 
Yesterday, I took action on the floor 
to keep the process moving along with 
the urgency that it demands. By rule, 
it set up our first procedural vote for 
tomorrow, and then, on Monday, the 
Senate will vote on passage. 
It has only been 2 days since Senate 
Republicans 
introduced 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act to give shape and struc-
ture to these urgent discussions. We 
put forward four objectives: 
First, put emergency cash in the 
hands of individuals and families as 
quickly as possible. 
Second, deliver the major relief that 
American small businesses need at this 
unprecedented time, and deliver it fast. 
Three, help bring some stability to 
our economy and prevent as many lay-
offs as possible. 
Four, continue to rush resources to 
the frontline healthcare workers and 
providers who are actually treating pa-
tients. 
And perhaps most important of all, 
we looked specifically for policies that 
could do all of the above as quickly as 
humanly possible. 
Small businesses all across the coun-
try have made it clear: If they are 
going to keep their lights on and keep 
their employees on payroll, they need 
help, and they need it now. 
Americans who have already been 
laid off due to this crisis have made it 
clear they need help and they need it 
now. Key national industries which are 
hemorrhaging 
business 
through 
no 
fault of their own but due to the gov-
ernment’s own public health guidance 
have made it clear: In order to retain 
their workers, they need help, and they 
need it now. 
In particular, every single American 
who has opened a newspaper or turned 
on the television in the last week has 
heard from our brave nurses, doctors, 
first responders, and public health ex-
perts: If our Nation is going to punch 
back and beat this virus, the people on 
the medical frontlines need our help, 
and they need it now. 
Senate 
Republicans 
put 
out 
our 
starting proposal as fast as we could. 
Then I created a structure for bipar-
tisan discussions to begin as fast as 
they could. No legislation will move 
through the Senate that does not con-
tain ideas from both parties. That is 
the way this body is designed. So these 
bipartisan talks have been essential, 
and they are ongoing, but what we need 
to do now is move forward. 
Now, 2 days ago the press reported 
that a senior Member of the House 
Democratic leadership told his col-
leagues: ‘‘This is a tremendous oppor-
tunity to restructure things to fit our 
vision’’—a senior Member of the House 
Democratic leadership. 
Well, let me suggest that that is ex-
actly—exactly—the 
wrong 
approach 
right now. That is the kind of thinking 
that could bog down these urgent dis-
cussions. That is the kind of mindset 
that the American people cannot afford 
for their elected representatives to 
adopt. I hope it does not describe the 
view of our own Senate Democratic 
colleagues as we try to close out these 
talks. 
More Americans are being laid off 
every day. More small businesses are 
being forced to shed payroll every day. 
Our nurses and doctors are running 
lower on key supplies every day. This 
is not a political opportunity. This is 
not a political opportunity. This is a 
national emergency. It is time to come 
together, finalize the results of our bi-
partisan discussions, and then close 
this out. 
Earlier this week, I had the Senate 
move quickly to pass the more modest 
bill that came over from the Demo-
cratic House of Representatives. I 
didn’t believe it was perfect—far from 
it. But Senate Republicans did not 
delay it needlessly. We did not try to 
originate our own version and burn 
several more days trying to fit them 
together. Instead, we treated that bill 
with the bipartisanship and urgency 
this crisis requires. Since then, the sit-
uation has only grown more dire, so I 
hope that our Senate Democratic col-
leagues and the Democratic House will 
bring equal bipartisanship and equal 
urgency to this legislation as well. 
In closing, I think all of us could 
take a lesson from our constituents. As 
we finish negotiating and finalize this 
bold legislation, we should look to the 
American people. Everywhere you look 
these past days, individuals, families, 
and organizations are stepping up to 
the plate and finding creative ways to 
serve those in need. 
One of my fellow Kentuckians is a 
woman named Erin Hinson. Erin lives 
in Louisville. She is someone whom 
doctors have told to be particularly 
careful these past few days, so her op-
portunities to pitch in were somewhat 
limited, but she was determined to do 
her part. Here is what she said: ‘‘I may 
never have the capacity to develop a 
vaccine or a magic pill to get rid of 
COVID–19 . . . but I can master a 
spreadsheet!’’ 
Erin 
created 
a 
website— 
Louisvillecovid19match.com. There is 
one signup sheet for neighbors who are 
older or at heightened risk and another 
signup sheet for neighbors who are 
young and healthy. And Erin is per-
forming a kind of matchmaking serv-
ice. If someone needs a prescription 
pickup or some groceries delivered or 
even a friendly phone call, she helps 
make the connection. 
With a little help from local media, 
Erin is already tracking more than 400 
volunteers—400 volunteers—from every 
Louisville ZIP Code. It is the perfect 
manifestation 
of 
Kentucky’s 
State 
motto: ‘‘United we stand, divided we 
fall.’’ United we stand—even if we have 
to stand 6 feet apart for a few weeks— 
and divided we fall. Brave and generous 
and creative Americans all across our 
Nation get it. They just need Congress 
to get it too. 
I am impressed and heartened by the 
speed and bipartisan spirit that has 
characterized the past day’s discus-
sions, but we need to keep it up. We ab-
solutely cannot let up now. We need to 
finish these negotiations and move for-
ward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1882 
March 21, 2020 
MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019—Motion 
to Proceed—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 748, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on 
high cost employer-sponsored health cov-
erage. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, each of 
us receives a report almost on an hour-
ly basis from our home States. At the 
end of the day, my State of Illinois 
sends a report on the latest situation 
involving this COVID–19 virus. There 
were 163 new infections announced yes-
terday—that is the biggest 1-day jump 
we have had—and 1 additional death. 
Governor Pritzker has issued a stay- 
at-home order for the State of Illinois 
today beginning Saturday, today, at 5 
p.m. until April 7. The city of Chicago 
is closing its parks and libraries, as 
well, starting today. 
The Veterans’ Administration has re-
ported one confirmed veteran’s case 
with the virus in the Chicago area. 
That person is now under home quar-
antine. 
We had an exceptional situation at 
Midway Airport where two FAA tower 
employees tested positive for the virus 
several days ago, and we, of course, 
have to have an abundance of care and 
caution for the remaining employees 
there. The FAA, together with the city 
of Chicago, has been involved with 
screening the other employees and also 
determining whether the workplace 
has been cleaned properly before any-
one goes back to work. The net result 
of it has been that Southwest Airlines 
announced suspending its flights in the 
Midway Airport because of this tower 
situation. When I spoke to the head of 
the Federal Aviation Administration, 
he told me there was a similar chal-
lenge at another major airport. 
I am afraid we haven’t heard the last 
of it. It is an indication of what hap-
pens when someone tests positive in a 
work atmosphere that is a critical part 
of our economy and the safety of our 
Nation. Our hope is—fingers crossed— 
that this tower may resume its activi-
ties the early part of next week, but we 
want to make sure that when we do, all 
the employees are going to be safe in 
their workplace. 
We are also laboring in Illinois, as 
many States are, with the problem of 
not having adequate testing. We just 
don’t know the extent of the infection. 
I mentioned the numbers that were re-
ported yesterday, but that is based on 
the very small sample of tests that are 
being taken. We still have not received 
the test kits, and those that we have, 
some of them cannot be used because 
they don’t have the necessary reagent 
or chemical that is part of the collec-
tion process. It turns out we are de-
pendent on a foreign source for that 
chemical. In ordinary times, it was 
never a problem, but in extraordinary 
times, it is. 
I joined with Senator ALEXANDER, 
Senator BLUNT, and Senator MURRAY 
asking 
the 
National 
Academy 
of 
Sciences, in the midst of this crisis, to 
step back, get to altitude, and look 
down on the dependence of the United 
States 
on 
foreign-made 
medicines, 
medical equipment, and medical de-
vices, and determine whether we need 
to reassess that dependence. 
In the ordinary course of business, 
there is no problem with things trav-
eling back and forth between the 
United States and foreign countries, 
but in this situation, where there is a 
public health crisis that has inter-
rupted ordinary trade patterns, or in 
the future, if we anticipate a similar 
challenge because of terrorism, we 
have to think ahead. 
I hope the National Academy of 
Sciences will give us their analysis of 
this situation as it currently exists and 
some guidance on how to look to these 
issues in the future. It is critical that 
we do. 
We also know that we have problems 
relating to our hospitals. One of the 
things we have urged Senator MCCON-
NELL to consider—and Senator SCHU-
MER used the term ‘‘Marshall Plan’’ for 
our hospitals—I think it is absolutely 
essential. 
Yesterday, I had a conference call 
with 30 or 40—maybe more—hospital 
administrators in the State of Illinois. 
I wanted to share some of the thoughts 
they gave me yesterday in the course 
of that conversation. This is through 
the Illinois Hospital Association. They 
said: What we need is a direct and im-
mediate infusion of funds. We need ac-
cess to critical supplies. We need a 
surge capacity. 
There are 300,000 hospital workers in 
Illinois. At this point, they need pro-
tective equipment that is lacking in so 
many areas. It turns out that our Fed-
eral stockpile—whatever it is worth— 
was either not large enough or cannot 
be distributed fast enough to meet the 
needs of these hospitals. 
One of the hospital administrators—I 
am not going to name the individual 
hospital, but one of the hospital admin-
istrators of a major hospital in Chicago 
said: We are worried about a shortage 
of ventilators. I heard that over and 
over again. 
They also want to let us know that 
these hospitals are taking huge finan-
cial hits today. We know about the res-
taurant industry because we see the 
closed restaurants, and we can imagine 
all the workers not reporting to work 
and trying to make things work for 
their families under the circumstances, 
but we don’t appreciate the fact that 
because of this COVID–19, many of our 
hospitals have seen a significant reduc-
tion in their revenue streams. 
One of the hospital administrators 
said: Our outpatient clinic work is 
down to a minimum, and elective sur-
geries are being put off for obvious rea-
sons. That is 50 percent of our revenue 
at the hospital, and so we have revenue 
issues going into this. 
They urged me to, through Medicare 
and 
Medicaid, 
increase 
reimburse-
ments, and based on preliminary bipar-
tisan discussions yesterday, I believe 
that is being considered. Both Medicaid 
and Medicare would increase the DRGs, 
for example, which is the reimburse-
ment mechanism for those treating 
COVID–19 patients. 
They are concerned—and they told 
me this over and over again—that at a 
moment when we need our hospitals 
more than ever, many of the hospitals 
are facing closure because they just 
don’t have the funds necessary to keep 
the doors open. The ordinary sources of 
revenue and profit have been pushed 
back and reduced. There are a variety 
of proposals that came to us in terms 
of making these Federal funds avail-
able, but they urged me over and over 
again to do this as quickly as possible 
and not to establish some long, in-
volved bureaucratic process for apply-
ing for these funds. 
We also talked about the money flow-
ing directly to the hospitals rather 
than through State governments or 
through some Federal agencies. I know 
this is risky business when it comes to 
accounting, but at a time of a national 
economic and public health crisis, I 
personally agree with them. I think we 
have no choice. 
I went through the hospitals, and 
they talked about their liquidity and 
cash problems. They said we need to 
treat this like a FEMA emergency. 
There are responses that use hospitals 
in those emergencies, that cut through 
the redtape and get the money to the 
places needed as quickly as possible. 
We have to do exactly the same thing. 
They talked about the number of in-
fections growing exponentially, and 
they also talked to me about one rural 
hospital that literally said they were 
within days of closing. I can tell you, 
in that area of the State—a rural part 
of the State of Illinois—it means pa-
tients facing any medical challenges 
will have long distances to travel to 
find a place to be treated. We can’t let 
that happen if it is at all possible to 
save these hospitals. 
They understand the overseas sup-
plies are coming in. Many of them are 
desperately needed. They asked if there 
is any way to expedite that by the use 
of cargo air that may not be utilized in 
the ordinary course of business. We are 
looking into that because of our eco-
nomic situation.

S1883 
March 21, 2020 
I could give more information, but I 
won’t. It is pretty obvious. The first 
line of defense for us in this public 
health crisis will be our hospitals. We 
are hoping that patients, through tele-
medicine, can be at least counseled and 
diagnosed and we can avoid people 
coming to emergency rooms unless it 
really is necessary. 
I understand the impulse we all have. 
If someone we love feels sick and ap-
pears to have the symptoms, we want 
them tested immediately and treated 
immediately. We have to take care and 
heed the advice even when it is hard. 
Telehealth is a way for us to have a 
better diagnosis of those in long dis-
tances and perhaps counsel them that 
an immediate trip to the emergency 
room is not necessary. I hope we can 
reach that point. 
We are also concerned about exten-
sion of facilities. Currently, the major 
hospitals in my State are looking to 
the expansion through tents—the kinds 
of emergency shelters that might be 
available so that people can be sepa-
rated from one another. 
Yesterday, I spoke to the Secretary 
of the Army, Mr. MCCARTHY, about the 
availability of Department of Defense 
expertise. The Department of Defense 
can step into a situation and very 
quickly convert hotels into hospital- 
type arrangements. They can take 
closed hospitals and put them up and 
running in very quick order. I think 
that expertise is desperately needed. 
I encouraged the Secretary of the 
Army and Secretary of the Defense to 
make that expertise available. We are 
connecting them right now, between 
our State and the experts at the De-
partment of Defense. These are men 
and women who do this. They are pre-
pared to do it at a moment’s notice if 
our military men and women are in 
peril. I would say at this point, Amer-
ica is in danger because of this, and we 
should turn to their responses and help 
as quickly as possible. 
I want to say one thing about a state-
ment made earlier today by both Sen-
ator SCHUMER and Senator MCCONNELL. 
We have before us an opportunity—and 
I hope we seize it—to show we can con-
tinue the bipartisanship that leads us 
to this moment. 
The first two bills that addressed this 
COVID–19 or coronavirus virus threat 
to America were handled in an extraor-
dinary way—perhaps to the surprise of 
many Americans. They were done on a 
bipartisan basis and on a timely basis. 
We have only had the Republican 
proposal for a little over 24 hours. Yet 
I can tell you that as soon as it was re-
ceived, active negotiations were under-
taken at all levels. I sat through many 
of them yesterday. They were done in 
good faith. There are differences, clear-
ly, in policy. We are really writing 
these bills as we travel down this 
path—this dangerous path. It is impor-
tant that we do it in a timely way but 
also exercise good judgment. 
My concern now is that we get this 
done and done this weekend because if 
we can finish this bill in a satisfactory 
way to both Republicans and Demo-
crats and report it to the House when 
they return next week, they will be 
able to take it up and move on it 
quickly. 
There are so many Americans who 
are desperately waiting for word from 
Washington as to what their future 
will be—first in terms of medical care 
but second in terms of keeping their 
families together in difficult times. I 
am not opposed, nor have I heard any-
one opposed to providing financial as-
sistance to individuals and families 
who really need it. We want to do that. 
I know the Presiding Officer has been a 
leader on this issue as well. But we also 
were hoping that we can include in this 
some guarantee that it won’t be one- 
and-done, that it isn’t just a matter of 
providing this one check, stepping 
back, 
and 
waiting 
for 
the 
con-
sequences. We know many people are 
facing long-term challenges and need 
an immediate and long-term commit-
ment from us to make sure their fami-
lies can stay together during this dif-
ficult time. I believe we can and 
should. 
Let me close by saying this is an ex-
ceptional time. We are isolated in one 
respect but closer in another. I think 
we all have come together in ways un-
anticipated. I have been on two— 
FaceTime and Zoom—apps this morn-
ing with members of my family, and we 
are doing this now almost on a daily 
basis. I feel more connected now in one 
respect than usually is the case. It is 
because we all care for one another. It 
goes beyond families; I believe that 
sentiment is shared across America. 
We have to keep it alive despite our po-
litical 
differences, 
despite 
all 
the 
things that separate us. There is so 
much more that brings us together and 
so much more that unites this country. 
We have to depend on that strength 
now more than ever. 
This is a challenge the likes of which 
we have never seen in our modern his-
tory. We can rise to this challenge, as 
we have so often in the past. I know we 
can do it in a unified way, bringing this 
Nation together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to clarify a statement I made earlier. I 
said that, because of problems at the 
control tower at Midway, Southwest 
Airlines had suspended its flights. It 
turns out it has substantially curtailed 
its flights, but it has not suspended all 
of its flights. 
I want to put that on the record be-
cause, in this moment of great national 
challenge, we should all take care that 
our remarks are accurate. The earlier 
press report has been amended by the 
newspapers, and I wanted to make my 
statement on the floor clear. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
thank you for presiding today, and to 
all who are here at this moment of ex-
treme challenge for our country and 
for the world, we must rise to the occa-
sion and unite to fight a common 
enemy, COVID–19, also known as the 
coronavirus. 
What we are witnessing is Americans 
from all backgrounds and all walks of 
life doing that around the country— 
coming together and uniting, not phys-
ically close, but spiritually close to 
one another as we work our way 
through this crisis. 
In my State of Maryland, people are 
doing exactly that. Our healthcare 
workers on the frontlines—whether 
they be nurses, whether they be people 
working in clinics, in the hospitals, 
whether they be doctors, they are all 
pulling together to get the job done. 
Elected officials from the Federal, 
State, and local governments are work-
ing together, as are nonprofits and 
businesses. 
Three nights ago, I held a telephone 
townhall meeting on COVID–19, and 
more than 5,000 Marylanders joined 
that call. They called in to share their 
hopes, their concerns, and their deter-
mination. 
Yesterday, in Maryland, we lost the 
second life to COVID–19, and our med-
ical services are being stretched thin. 
But people are coming together to get 
the job done, and as we address the 
healthcare challenges, we must also 
deal with the financial and economic 
pain that is arising from that and 
spreading quickly. 
Most of all, Marylanders, like other 
Americans, told us they want clear 
guidance from public health officials 
and a united and effective response to 
both the healthcare crisis and the eco-
nomic fallout. 
Since Marylanders are united and 
Americans are united, we, too, in Con-
gress must unite to do our job. And to 
date—to date—we have risen to meet 
the moment. The question is, What 
comes next? 
Over a few weeks ago, we did unite to 
pass emergency legislation to provide 
$8.3 billion to provide funding to our 
public health systems and to direct 
more dollars toward developing a vac-
cine and therapeutics. 
Last week we passed a measure to en-
sure that tests for the coronavirus are 
free. It makes no sense to have any 
American discouraged from getting a

test because they can’t pay for it. That 
hurts them; that hurts the entire com-
munity. That was an important provi-
sion, as was the emergency food assist-
ance for people in need. 
In States that have closed schools, 
we have lots of students who are now 
home. Many of those students get one 
of their best meals at school during 
lunch, so that emergency food assist-
ance has been absolutely vital. In 
Maryland, we have about 350 schools 
that are now being used for families to 
pick up food for their kids and for oth-
ers in the community. 
We help provide more resources to 
State insurance systems, which are 
being stressed more and more as we 
speak, and we need to do a lot more on 
that front. 
We passed emergency sick leave 
measures because we do not want to 
have anybody feeling that they have to 
go to work in order to get the pay-
check to pay the bills if they are feel-
ing sick. That is bad for them, and ob-
viously it is bad for their coworkers 
who would risk getting the virus. So 
we took an important measure there, 
although there, as well, there were big 
gaps in the paid sick leave provisions, 
which we must close as we work on 
round 3 of this legislation. 
So that brings me to what we are 
going to face now in the coming 12 to 
24 hours, which is coming up with an 
economic 
package—a 
package 
that 
deals with the economic fallout, and I 
want to address what I think should be 
our priorities there. 
But before I do that, I do want to 
take a moment to talk about the 
healthcare situation that we are wit-
nessing right now because, of course, to 
the extent that we can stop the spread 
of the virus, to the extent we stop the 
contagion from the virus, that is also 
the fastest way to try to get our econ-
omy back on track. What we are seeing 
is so many businesses going under and 
being 
threatened 
because 
of 
pre-
cautions 
people 
are 
taking—under-
standable precautions—to make sure 
that we don’t spread the virus. 
So in that fight on the healthcare 
front, I want to salute—I want to sa-
lute—and thank all those healthcare 
workers who are on the frontlines: the 
nurses, the hospital and clinic staffs, 
the doctors who are doing heroic work 
and putting their lives and their health 
at risk to help others and save the lives 
of others. 
We here in this Chamber must do ev-
erything in our power to support them 
in that important work—to support 
them as they support others. That be-
gins with making sure they have all 
the equipment they need to protect 
themselves, but that is not happening. 
That is not happening as we gather 
here. 
There are severe shortages in the 
supply of masks, shortages in supplies 
of simple but essential items, like 
gloves and gowns. 
It took far too long, but the Presi-
dent finally invoked his authority 
under the Defense Production Act, 
which helps spur domestic production 
of some of these supplies. But even as 
we gather now, it is not clear whether 
that is really up and running as it 
should be. In fact, it is suggested from 
reports that we are falling short. 
At the same time, we know others in 
the world are experiencing these short-
ages. They are also being hit hard by 
the coronavirus. So here in the United 
States, we cannot continue to expect 
to get these necessary supplies from 
overseas when they are going to need 
them and keep them in their own coun-
tries, and that is why it is essential 
that we ramp up efforts yesterday to 
make sure that we have these supply 
chains here at home. 
Testing of the coronavirus—it is 
clear that the coronavirus got an 8- to 
10-week head start in this country, and 
we were woefully unprepared, espe-
cially with respect to tests to try to 
identify the spread of the virus and 
where it was and how fast it was mov-
ing. We were also unprepared on our 
testing infrastructure. 
While we are now ramping up, we are 
still far behind. There are still far too 
many bottlenecks in the system. At 
Johns Hopkins University in Balti-
more, they are doing their own testing, 
but their testing has been limited by 
shortages in reagents. That was true a 
week ago; it continues to be true 
today. And the University of Maryland 
Medical System, another major re-
search hospital system in our State, 
has not yet begun to do their testing 
because of continued shortages of re-
agents. That is absolutely unaccept-
able. 
We are also hearing of shortages in 
swabs—simple swabs—simply to take 
the test. We need to ramp up the test-
ing supply. We also need to knock 
down the barriers to getting tests. We 
need to adopt the South Korean model, 
and many of us have been calling for 
this for a long time. We see States and 
Governors moving forward with this, 
but the Federal Government needs to 
take a much more active role in estab-
lishing that infrastructure. 
Ventilators—we have more and more 
sick patients, and if the trajectories 
continue, it is clear we will face a 
shortage in ventilators. We have to 
ramp this up much faster than we are 
doing right now because, otherwise, we 
are going to have a lifesaving treat-
ment intervention that will not be 
available for those who need it. 
Mr. President, we are witnessing 
shortages in hospital beds overall and 
shortages of beds in ICUs. We need the 
Army Corps of Engineers to be working 
and building out this necessary emer-
gency infrastructure. 
As we take these emergency meas-
ures, we also need to continue to do the 
urgent work of developing therapeutics 
and a vaccine. 
I visited the National Institutes of 
Health about 3 or 4 weeks ago. It is a 
national treasure. We are proud to 
have it located in the State of Mary-
land along with the FDA. At NIH, I 
met with scientists who are on the 
frontlines of developing the vaccine. 
They are working 24/7. 
I think this moment is appropriate to 
salute all the men and women who 
work at NIH. I hope I never see another 
budget proposal coming down that cuts 
the vital medical research that is con-
ducted there and around the country. 
They are working on a vaccine, and 
they are working on therapeutics. 
They are in the process of conducting 
clinical trials on both. As we have 
heard reported, they are conducting 
clinical trials on some off-label drugs. 
These are drugs that have been devel-
oped to try to fight against other dis-
eases. They may not have worked 
against other diseases. They may work 
as a therapeutic in this case of the 
coronavirus, but as Dr. Fauci has 
warned us, nobody will know until we 
do a clinical trial and nobody’s hope 
should be unrealistically raised until 
the evidence is in. 
On the vaccine front, we have been 
told by the scientists—by Dr. Fauci 
and others in his lab—that it will take 
a minimum of 12 to 18 months to de-
velop a vaccine, and that is much fast-
er than the usual timetable to develop 
a vaccine. People are working overtime 
to get this done. Clinical trials have al-
ready begun on a vaccine, as well, but 
12 to 18 months, while fast for devel-
oping a new vaccine, is a long time 
given the immediate crisis that we face 
now. 
So what do we do now on the 
healthcare front? First, no more mixed 
messages—let’s let the healthcare au-
thorities speak and provide the guid-
ance that the American people need at 
this time. 
For far too long, the President of the 
United States downplayed the crisis, 
even calling it a hoax at one point. We 
know it is not a hoax. We know the 
death toll and the number of sick con-
tinues to rise, and we must pull to-
gether in a fact-based way to address 
it. We have to listen to people like Dr. 
Fauci and others who have called for 
dramatic social distancing measures. 
One of those measures we must take 
is teleworking wherever we can do it. 
We have seen offices here in the Senate 
and the House rapidly move toward 
teleworking and make changes in their 
offices to facilitate teleworking. Just a 
few days ago, the President finally said 
to the country that employers should 
facilitate telework—a little late, but it 
was the right message. Unfortunately, 
there has been a lot of foot dragging in 
the executive branch itself when it 
comes to teleworking. I and a number 
of our colleagues have asked the Presi-
dent to issue an Executive order on 
teleworking. The President has not 
done that yet. 
The head of the Office of Personnel 
Management resigned a few days ago. 
This is the person who is in charge of 
all the Federal Government personnel 
from an operational standpoint and 
who resigned in the middle of this cri-
sis. We don’t know why. Finally, OMB,

March 21, 2020 
or the Office of Management and Budg-
et, issued a directive to agencies saying 
to maximize telework. But I represent 
a lot of Federal employees, and I am 
hearing from lots of them that their 
agencies apparently haven’t gotten the 
message. The President needs to issue 
that Executive order, and he needs to 
do it today. Too many Federal employ-
ees are being put at risk because agen-
cies have not taken the time to expand 
telework opportunities. We need to 
lead by example, not from behind. 
Many Governors are leading by ex-
ample and States are doing that, as are 
local officials. They are directing the 
necessary social distancing measures. 
In my State of Maryland, Governor 
Hogan has closed schools to prevent 
the spread of the virus. Restaurants 
are closed, bars are closed, gyms are 
closed, 
and 
many 
other 
gathering 
places are closed. There are all of those 
social distancing steps being taken— 
whether by government directive or 
voluntarily, by our constituents heed-
ing the calls to take these pre-
cautionary measures. All of those nec-
essary steps have resulted in a huge 
and escalating economic fallout. 
Thousands of workers have already 
been furloughed or laid off around the 
country. Small businesses are being 
crushed. No customers in the door, no 
sales, and no income mean you can’t 
pay your employees. It means you 
can’t pay your bills. Whether they are 
mortgages on your restaurant or mort-
gages on your home, those bills are 
still due and coming. 
So what do we do? What do we do as 
we approach round 3 here in the U.S. 
Senate and House, having successfully 
worked on a bipartisan basis to address 
rounds 1 and 2? First of all, as for un-
employment insurance, because of rap-
idly escalating layoffs around the 
country, claims are rising, and we need 
to rise to the occasion. We need a far 
more robust system, and, certainly, 
during 
this 
emergency 
period, 
we 
should provide 100 percent wage re-
placement to workers who have lost 
their jobs through no fault of their own 
as a result of this crisis. 
We also need to address the totally 
antiquated aspects of our unemploy-
ment insurance system. Some of that 
will have to wait until after the crisis, 
but on an emergency basis, we need to 
address the needs of people who are 
working as self-employed individual 
contractors. 
Let’s say you are an event planner, 
and all of your events got canceled. 
You are not currently in the unemploy-
ment system in most States, probably, 
but you are no longer getting any in-
come. We need to make sure the unem-
ployment system in this emergency ad-
dresses those workers and we need to 
work on a long-term fix. There is the 
gig economy. We all know the gig econ-
omy is a larger and larger share of our 
economy. A lot of those workers are 
not covered. If you are a worker who is 
in the taxi business or working for one 
of the other transportation agencies, 
you are not able to pick up folks at the 
airport anymore because people aren’t 
coming to the airport, and you are not 
covered by other unemployment sys-
tems. 
So if it is Uber or others, we need to 
address those workers and make sure 
they have wage replacement during 
this terrible shutdown of parts of the 
economy. We need to focus on that. 
Senator WYDEN has introduced a bill— 
I am proud to cosponsor it with him— 
that addresses many of these issues, 
but we need to tackle it as part of the 
bill that we are dealing with right now, 
because these people are losing their 
jobs right now. 
Second is no foreclosures or evictions 
during this period of time. You lose 
your job. You got no money. We are 
working on wage replacement, but we 
haven’t done this yet. In the mean-
time, bills are coming due. Someone is 
demanding 
a 
mortgage 
payment. 
Someone is demanding a rent payment. 
We need to freeze collections of these 
payments and defer payments until 
after the emergency. 
This is easier said than done, because 
when we say to a landlord that they 
can’t collect the rent, we also need to 
say to the bank who loaned money to 
the owner of the building that they 
have to exercise forbearance on that 
loan. 
That is why a group of us and I orga-
nized a letter recently that went to the 
heads of the financial regulatory agen-
cies—the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC—ask-
ing them to use the full extent of their 
powers to address this issue in a way 
that deals with the entire economic 
food chain, from the lenders at the top 
of the chain to the borrowers at the 
bottom of the chain, because they are 
the ones in a position to do it. 
I just got a letter back last night 
from the FDIC. I hope to hear from the 
others quickly, but we don’t have time 
to wait. We should address that issue 
to the maximum extent in our powers 
in round 3, which we are working on 
right now. 
Third, small businesses and medium- 
sized businesses are crushed—no cus-
tomers in the door, no revenue, bills 
mounting, trying to make payroll. Of 
course, many of them have already had 
to lay off some of their employees be-
cause their bills are coming due, and 
they have to try to figure out how to 
simply stay afloat. 
A lot of people have said: Well, let’s 
give these small businesses emergency 
loans. Well, if you think about it, if 
you are a small mom-and-pop oper-
ation, another loan at this point, when 
there are no customers coming in the 
door, is simply going to saddle you 
with more and more debt at the end of 
this emergency. So extending a loan is, 
in some ways, for these small busi-
nesses throwing them an anchor, be-
cause they are never going to be able 
to recover. They are only going to have 
more and more debts to pay off at the 
end of the day when they are trying to 
restart their businesses and get people 
back in the door. 
I have a wonderful local example. Her 
name is Julie Verratti. She is the co- 
owner of the brewery and restaurant in 
Maryland called Denizens. It is a fam-
ily business. She wrote to me a number 
of days ago, because she is undergoing 
exactly these kinds of stresses and 
pressures. She writes: 
Small businesses need a bailout right now 
without delay. The number one thing we 
need is cash retention and cash infusion. 
Here are specific actions that will help 
make that happen: 
1. [An] immediate moratorium on all com-
mercial debt payments (loans and credit 
cards) mortgages, and rents. If you have to 
choose, focus on SBA loans because small 
businesses are the only ones that go the SBA 
backed route. 
She also says: 
Immediate moratorium on all evictions 
and foreclosures. 
We have to work on that front. I 
talked about that. But we also have to 
attack this from all angles. That is 
why this small business relief is so es-
sential, and it must take the form of 
grants, so long as the businesses use 
that money for prescribed purposes: 
maintaining payroll—whatever payroll 
may be left—and paying their ongoing 
debts and obligations. Loans, as Julie 
says, will not fix this for small busi-
nesses. It must be in the form of 
grants—again, so long as the recipient 
complies with the terms of that grant. 
Small businesses like mom-and-pop 
organizations that already had to lay 
off employees should not be penalized. 
They should be eligible for the grants 
to pay their mortgages to keep them-
selves afloat. 
Many midsized businesses are in this 
position as well. We need to address 
that because they are in many cases 
laying off employees in large numbers. 
Just for a local example, people who 
live in this area may be familiar with 
Silver Diner. Unlike Dunkin’ Donuts, 
which works on a franchise model, the 
Silver Diner owns its different Silver 
Diners throughout the region. They 
have 1,800 employees. Their employees, 
in most cases, have had to be fur-
loughed or laid off because of no money 
in the door. But the Silver Diner is too 
big an operation to meet the strict re-
quirements of the Small Business Ad-
ministration. So, in this emergency 
situation, we need to provide flexi-
bility that allows us to help some of 
these middle-sized businesses that are 
undergoing incredible stress because 
we want to make sure we help their 
workers and help them retain as many 
workers as they can, but also to make 
sure they can pay their bills when no 
customers are coming in the door. 
They need to pay the bills so that, 
when this is over, they can open up op-
erations and rehire those employees. 
That 
is 
why 
Senators 
MURPHY, 
MERKLEY, and I introduced a proposal 
yesterday to address these stresses on 
small and medium-sized businesses, not 
with emergency loans that they are 
not going to be able to afford to repay 
later, but with emergency grants so 
long as those grants are used for the

purposes indicated. That would put 
these small and midsized businesses in 
a position to rehire their employees 
once 
this 
economic 
storm 
passes 
through. 
There are, of course, other major in-
dustries that have been hard hit, and 
we should consider what kind of relief 
is appropriate for them, like the air-
lines. We have to be very careful that 
we don’t repeat some of the things that 
went wrong in the past when it came to 
helping big businesses. Yes, we would 
like to help their workers through this 
storm, but we need to make sure that 
any funds that go to the airlines, for 
example, are not used for more stock 
buybacks that simply help their stock-
holders and executives and CEOs. 
The airlines have engaged in a huge 
amount of stock buybacks in the last 
year, including after the $2 trillion tax 
cut that was provided. Instead of using 
a lot of that revenue to invest in their 
workers and plant equipment, a lot of 
it went out the door in the form of 
stock buybacks, and it would be unac-
ceptable for any relief monies to go for 
that kind of purpose or to go for any 
kind of bonuses. 
In fact, if the taxpayers are going to 
be making some investments to keep 
some of these big industries afloat, we 
should look at what we did in some of 
the earlier cases later in the game with 
respect to preferred stock so that tax-
payers get fully repaid and we also 
have a stake in the future success of 
that investment. 
One other big area that has not got-
ten much attention in discussions here 
on Capitol Hill until the last few days 
has been the huge needs being faced by 
State and local governments—States 
like my State of Maryland, cities like 
Baltimore City, and other cities and 
towns in Maryland. They are on the 
frontlines in many respects, and they 
are facing huge pressures, which is why 
we received a letter, an emergency plea 
from the National Governors Associa-
tion, just the other day. 
This is a bipartisan point from Gov-
ernors 
Larry 
Hogan 
and 
Andrew 
Cuomo, and they point out, No. 1, that 
Medicaid is a major source of Federal 
help that they use to provide for the 
medical needs of people in their States, 
and they are asking for an increase in 
FMAP. We provided some increase in 
FMAP in one of the earlier bills we 
passed, but they desperately need more 
as the health impact of the virus con-
tinues to spread. 
As you can imagine, transit systems, 
whether paid for by States or local ju-
risdictions, are essentially seeing all 
their revenues dry up as people under-
standably don’t get on those crowded 
systems. So no revenue means that 
they are in a world of hurt. We need to 
provide emergency help. 
The National League of Cities has 
also sent us a letter talking about 
similar kinds of needs, and we need to 
address those needs in this bill, round 
3, and not, as some are suggesting, 
postpone that to some future date. We 
don’t know when that would be because 
the emergency is now, and the need is 
now. 
Finally, this healthcare crisis has ex-
posed some huge fissures in our society 
in the kind of safety net that we pro-
vide. I am not going to go into the en-
tire list because it is too exhaustive to 
go through, but I want to highlight a 
couple of things. 
We had, in the first instance, the 
question of whether people are going to 
have to pay for the coronavirus tests. 
We all recognize that it is a public 
health imperative. It would be a mis-
take to have people have to pay for 
tests because, if you can’t afford it and 
therefore don’t get it, then it not only 
hurts you, but it hurts other people. 
There has been a lot of discussion 
about the vaccine. When we develop a 
vaccine—and we hope we will—that 
also needs to be available to all Ameri-
cans without cost. That is something 
we need to address. 
Senator SCOTT from Florida and I 
have pointed out that a lot of the drugs 
that are developed by pharmaceutical 
companies are drugs that benefited 
from the research at the National In-
stitutes of Health. And who pays for 
the research at the National Institutes 
of Health—at NIH? Well, the taxpayer, 
to the tune of about $40 billion a year. 
So it makes no sense at all for the 
taxpayers, who made this big invest-
ment in research and development of a 
drug, to then be price-gouged by the 
pharmaceutical companies that take 
the benefits of that good work and then 
add a big, big pricetag. Our proposal 
would make sure that where you have 
that kind of public investment in re-
search and development, you essen-
tially have a process to make sure that 
there is a reasonable price. Ultimately, 
when it comes to a public health vac-
cine, as is being developed now, we 
need to make sure that it is available 
to everybody and that nobody cannot 
afford that. 
Second, as our schools have been 
shut in many States, we are seeing the 
results of the digital divide—just one 
piece of that—because there are a lot of 
students who don’t have access to the 
internet, and, therefore, they are not 
going to be able to engage in distance 
learning if this crisis continues and 
schools decide to try to expand dis-
tance learning. Why? Because they are 
not connected to the internet or they 
don’t have a computer at home, so 
many of us have introduced proposals 
on this. I have introduced a bill to 
close the digital homework gap. We are 
asking the FCC to use emergency au-
thorities to direct funds to buy de-
vices—simple devices—that a student 
who is not connected to the internet 
could use to get some reception to be 
able to do their homework. We should 
do that right now, but then, of course, 
we have the longer term challenge of 
building out that broadband infrastruc-
ture to deal with the digital divide. 
Then there are things we should do 
to make sure we are better prepared. 
There is a long list of those, but one of 
them is pretty simple. Senator ANGUS 
KING and I have sent a letter to the 
folks who are finalizing and putting 
this bill together to require that the 
office at the White House that had pre-
viously existed under the Obama ad-
ministration—the office that was set 
up specifically to be an early warning 
system for a pandemic response like 
the one we are witnessing—that that be 
a permanent office within the White 
House and that no future President 
would be able to dismantle that office. 
We are learning now, the hard way, 
what happens when you don’t have that 
early warning system and strategic re-
sponse at the highest levels of the U.S. 
Government. 
So those are some of the things we 
should be doing. As we gather here, 
America’s best minds—our top sci-
entists around the world—are looking 
to answer questions about the virus 
and help develop a vaccine. Brave 
healthcare workers are treating the 
sick and preparing for many more pa-
tients. The people who produce and de-
liver our food and other essentials, who 
keep our water, power, and internet on 
are all at work, whether in their work 
spaces or teleworking. First responders 
are on duty, and our military con-
tinues to defend the Nation. 
Marylanders 
and 
Americans 
are 
doing their part—staying at home, so-
cial distancing, finding ways to be to-
gether while apart, and, perhaps most 
challenging for kids, staying busy and 
not going completely stir-crazy. Teach-
ers and students are embracing dis-
tance learning. Families are marking 
birthdays and other special occasions 
with e-cards and video chats. Those at 
the lowest risk are doing what they 
can to protect the most vulnerable 
among us. 
The fundamental decency of all these 
Americans is shining through. I draw 
strength and faith from their actions, 
and I know that, together—if not phys-
ically together—working together, we 
will succeed. We will succeed if we 
come together here in the House and 
the Senate like Americans are working 
together around the country. If we can 
do that at this moment, as we ap-
proach round 3 of our actions, then I 
am absolutely confident that the coun-
try will have the resources and direc-
tion it needs. Let us be as united and 
determined as the American people. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEN-
NEDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are

ical for the U.S. Senate, but these are 
not typical times. More than a month

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1887 
March 21, 2020 
across the country, some of the first 
coronavirus patients who were evacu-
ated from China arrived in San Anto-
nio, TX. They were quarantined at 
Lackland Air Force Base and treated 
by the dedicated health professionals 
there. 
At that point, things looked a lot dif-
ferent. Outside of those evacuees, no 
Texans were known to have acquired 
the coronavirus, and, for the most part, 
the virus didn’t impact people’s daily 
lives. They would see updates on the 
news about the growing number of 
cases in China, read about the people 
being evacuated from cruise ships and 
other countries, but there was no evi-
dence 
the 
disease 
was 
spreading 
through 
our 
communities. 
Schools 
were filled with children, restaurants 
with customers, and arenas with sports 
fans. 
But, as we know now, it didn’t take 
long before the situation took a quick 
turn. Once new cases began popping up, 
it was clear that our communities were 
exposed. Over the last few weeks, the 
virus has spread across the country, 
and our health officials and community 
leaders have taken every precaution to 
keep their people safe. They have can-
celed in-person classes, emptied office 
buildings, called off large events, and 
encouraged folks to stay home and 
avoid close contact with others. 
On Thursday, in Texas, Governor Ab-
bott issued an executive order adopting 
the standards set out by the President 
and the Centers for Disease Control to 
further slow the spread across the en-
tire State. Among other measures, this 
executive order closed schools and re-
quired all restaurants, bars, and food 
courts to put a stop to dine-in options. 
They have to move to drive-through, 
carry-out, or delivery service only. 
Now, I believe these precautions are 
in the best interest of the public 
health. Certainly, we hope they don’t 
have to last long, but they are nec-
essary now, and I want to thank the 
Governor for taking these steps in the 
interest of public safety. 
As cities across the State and across 
the country have taken similar pre-
cautions, we have seen the economic 
consequences that these difficult deci-
sions have brought about. Our local 
restaurants, hardware stores, and gyms 
don’t have the money to keep paying 
their employees’ wages and expenses 
without anything coming in the front 
door. 
Through no fault of their own, many 
of these businesses suddenly find them-
selves without customers to serve, but 
the bills are still coming in. Expenses 
continue to pile up—things like rent, 
utilities, and other things you can’t 
avoid, even if you are not paying pay-
roll. 
Then, there are the employees won-
dering how long they are going to have 
to be off the job and how long it will be 
before they are able to apply for unem-
ployment compensation or otherwise 
pay for their expenses. 
This is different from any crisis since 
I have been in the Senate. I got here 
shortly after 9/11. We know what that 
was like. It was about a trillion-dollar 
hit to our economy. Obviously, it was a 
national security incident. Three thou-
sand Americans were killed here in the 
United States, and that started the war 
on terror, which we have been fighting 
ever since. 
In 2008, we had the great economic 
meltdown on Wall Street because of all 
of these exotic mortgage products that 
the banking and the mortgage industry 
had created. We remember what hap-
pened there. Unfortunately, it became 
necessary for us to take extraordinary 
measures to help the very same indus-
try that caused the problem back in 
2008. As distasteful as that was, I be-
lieve it was in the best interest of the 
country and our ability to recover from 
that disaster. 
This is different. Nobody in this 
country caused this problem. We are 
all equal victims of this virus. So I 
think, as we look at how we should re-
spond to this epidemic—or pandemic, 
as now it has been called because it is 
global in nature—we need to look at 
how we can target the help to the peo-
ple who need it the most in order to 
bridge this gap between the lack of a 
paycheck and unavailability of unem-
ployment insurance, and how do busi-
nesses, small and large, burn through 
their cash or reserves but still stay 
alive so that they can rehire the same 
people they have laid off once this cri-
sis passes. 
What I am hoping happens is that, 
after this crisis passes, we learn some 
important lessons, things about the 
supply chain for our medication, sup-
ply chain for medical equipment and 
the like, and what we need to do to 
protect ourselves and the rest of the 
globe against pandemics like this, be-
cause there has been, in my lifetime, 
nothing quite like this in terms of the 
fear it has engendered and the reaction 
of both the markets and the economy— 
as well as the public health concerns. 
So we need to learn important les-
sons from that. In the interim, we need 
to do everything we can to lend a help-
ing hand to those who need our help. 
The Senate has already passed two 
bills as part of what we all know will 
be a long recovery process. The first fo-
cused primarily on our public health 
system by sending vital funding to 
healthcare providers, investing in the 
development 
of 
vaccines, 
possible 
treatments, and more diagnostic tests. 
Something I hear from my Governor 
and our local officials, something they 
need the most and ask me about the 
most, is testing, so that, for people who 
develop symptoms, they can figure out 
whether this is the seasonal flu, aller-
gies, something else, or is this the 
COVID–19 virus, because, if it is the 
COVID–19 virus, they need to be iso-
lated, either at home under the watch-
ful eye of their healthcare professional 
or, in some cases, if they become seri-
ously ill, if their breathing becomes 
compromised, they need to go to the 
hospital. So the first bill focused pri-
marily on the healthcare aspects. The 
second bill that was passed, signed by 
the President just a few days ago—I 
think it was on Thursday—focused 
more on the small businesses and indi-
vidual workers who have been im-
pacted. 
Of course, as we all know, we are now 
working on the third installment. We 
don’t know how many installments 
will be required, how many chapters 
are in this book that we are in the 
process of writing, but we know that 
this is important, and it is important 
that we act with effectiveness but 
speed at the same time. 
This is the largest of the bills so far. 
We are talking about amounts of 
money that stagger my imagination, 
but I believe this emergency requires 
bold action to address this pandemic 
from every angle possible. As I said, 
once this passes, we need to learn the 
lessons that this virus is trying to 
teach us to make sure we never find 
ourselves in this sort of vulnerable po-
sition again. But, in the meantime, we 
have other work to do. 
As the leader has previously out-
lined, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act—the acronym 
is CARES Act—will take action on four 
major priorities: 
We will see, for people who, through 
no fault of their own, don’t have any 
money coming in, direct financial aid— 
something many of us never would 
have 
contemplated 
under 
non-
emergency circumstances. We will see, 
of course, relief for the small busi-
nesses I mentioned, people like the res-
taurants, hotels, and others. They have 
no customers because their business is 
shut—again, not through any fault of 
their own but because, by order of their 
Governor or local government official, 
for public health purposes they are 
shut down. So we need to find some 
way to throw a lifeline to those small 
businesses. 
Then, I believe, for those large em-
ployers that hire tens or maybe hun-
dreds of thousands and probably mil-
lions of Americans, we need to find a 
way to help them obtain loans that 
they will pay back, with interest, but 
that will bridge this period of time 
while they are burning cash and won-
dering: Will I still be around? Will I 
still be viable as a business once this 
crisis passes? 
What we need to have happen is, once 
we defeat this virus, we need to make 
sure that America goes back to work 
and our economy, which was incredibly 
strong until this virus hit, is restored. 
I am hopeful that some of the projec-
tions that we have seen by people like 
JPMorgan and others, which, unfortu-
nately, show a dramatically negative 
impact of the virus during the first and 
second quarter, the second quarter 
probably being the worst—we need to 
make sure that this is a V-shaped re-
covery. In other words, when we hit 
bottom, we need to make sure our 
economy bounces back, and that means 
these businesses need to remain intact,

and they need to be prepared to rehire 
their employees if they had laid them 
off. And we need to make sure that our 
economy is restored by a rapid recov-
ery. 
That is why I think this bill is so im-
portant. 
Of course, the fourth is more support 
for our healthcare professionals. On the 
first point, direct aid, we know many 
workers have lost their jobs or had 
their hours seriously cut down. As we 
all know, that is especially true for the 
service 
and 
hospitality 
industries, 
which have been the hardest hit. 
Think about your local waiter, some-
body working for tips, somebody work-
ing for an hourly wage—bartenders, 
hairdressers, housekeepers—the ones 
who, only a few weeks ago, had jobs 
and steady paychecks and are now 
without any income with which to sus-
tain themselves or their families. They 
are wondering how they are going to 
pay the rent before the first of the 
month, cover their electric bill, buy 
groceries to feed their family, and 
keeps things afloat until life returns to 
normal. 
We are working to get that money 
into the hands of Texans and Ameri-
cans who need help now, as fast and as 
efficiently and as effectively as pos-
sible—no paperwork to fill out, just di-
rect aid from Washington to middle- 
class Americans. Again, it is something 
I never would have contemplated in a 
nonemergency situation, but I think, 
under this situation, we need to act 
quickly and we need to act effectively 
to get money into the hands of those 
who, through no fault of their own, 
don’t have any money coming in. 
This can help cover expenses while 
their income is short, perhaps provide 
a little extra stability, and inject a lit-
tle extra money into our economy 
when it is desperately needed. 
On small businesses other than the 
ones I have mentioned, I have heard 
from a number of them who are wor-
ried they will not be able to weather 
the storm without significant and im-
mediate financial assistance in some 
form. Well, this legislation would pro-
vide new small business interruption 
loans through their local financial in-
stitutions—the 
banks, 
their 
credit 
unions. These businesses can turn to 
those banks and credit unions and who-
ever their preferred lender might be for 
a federally backed, Small Business Ad-
ministration 
loan. 
Qualifying 
busi-
nesses can use this money to cover 
their rent, core expenses, and payroll. 
In fact, that is what we want them to 
do. We want them to continue to keep 
their employees on the payroll if they 
can so that, as soon as people start 
showing up again to patronize their 
business, we can see the economy take 
off as these people are restored to their 
former jobs. We are hoping to minimize 
the disruption that this virus will have 
for our Main Street businesses and do 
as much as possible to avoid layoffs. 
But we also need financial assist-
ance—I would call it economic sta-
bilization—for some of the largest em-
ployers in the country, including our 
airlines, that our economy depends 
upon. Now, I said ‘‘loans’’ because this 
money will be repaid. As to those peo-
ple who claim that somehow we are 
bailing out large American corpora-
tions, that is not what we are pro-
posing here. We are not giving compa-
nies a free pass for their own bad deci-
sions. 
Again, nobody here in America con-
tributed to this condition in which we 
find ourselves. That was the virus that 
emanated in Wuhan Province in China. 
But if we are going to have any chance 
of rebounding in the long term, we 
have to ensure that these businesses 
can survive. No American business, 
from your local sandwich shop to a 
major airline, asked for or expected 
this turmoil, and they need our support 
now. 
The final pillar of this bill will hit at 
the cause of this crisis: the virus itself. 
Supporting 
our 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals and first responders and ensur-
ing that they have the resources and 
equipment they need is priority No. 1. 
We also need to continue investing in 
the 
development 
of 
a 
vaccine—al-
though 
we 
know 
that 
will 
take 
months—in the interim, and possible 
treatments, including some of the 
drugs that are already on the market 
that are now being tested by the Food 
and Drug Administration to see wheth-
er this new application for combating 
the COVID–19 virus is effective and safe 
for people to take, and, of course, more 
testing and diagnostics. That is one of 
the things that distinguish America 
from the rest of the world on not only 
how resilient we are but how quickly 
we innovate our way out of problems. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, we 
were just at a meeting where Senator 
ALEXANDER, 
the 
chairman 
of 
the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, said that soon he an-
ticipated a new, FDA-approved testing 
kit for the coronavirus that will be 
widely available. People who now can’t 
get access to a test will be able to use 
the test based on advice from their 
medical provider and gain the con-
fidence of knowing ‘‘Hey, I am nega-
tive. I don’t have anything to worry 
about personally, and what I need to do 
is to continue to do what the Centers 
for Disease Control told us all we need 
to do, which is to maintain good per-
sonal hygiene and social distancing’’— 
a new phrase that we have all become 
acquainted with. As long as you are 
negative and you do those things, then 
you are likely going to be healthy and 
not be affected directly by this virus. 
That is one of the things that are 
happening in real time now—develop-
ment of the new tests. The prolifera-
tion of this inexpensive and quick test-
ing will allow for people who are posi-
tive to be identified so they can be 
treated 
either 
at 
home 
or 
in 
a 
healthcare facility. 
The truth is, most of us—if you are 
otherwise healthy, if you get the 
coronavirus, you may experience some 
minor symptoms. One of the biggest 
concerns is people who got the virus 
and are asymptomatic or presymp-
tomatic and whether they are infecting 
other people. But for most of us, you 
will be fine after you recover, but you 
need to be isolated so you don’t infect 
others. And some people—particularly 
the 
elderly 
and 
people 
with 
comorbidities, underlying illnesses, or 
medical conditions, who are the most 
vulnerable—will have to be hospital-
ized, to be sure. 
This is one of those all-hands-on-deck 
moments unlike I have ever experi-
enced before in my service in the Sen-
ate. I appreciate the response from the 
administration and the President on 
down. I appreciate the cooperation 
among our colleagues who have worked 
to prepare not only the initial proposal 
but who are working now on a bipar-
tisan basis to come up with a package 
we can vote on quickly. I hope negotia-
tions with our Democratic colleagues 
will move smoothly and meet the ma-
jority leader’s target of having a pack-
age we can vote on on Monday. 
Will this be the last bill we pass rel-
ative to this crisis? I doubt it, but we 
don’t know for sure because that, I 
think, is what is driving so much of the 
volatility in the markets and the un-
certainty and fear that some people 
feel—it is the unknown. As we work 
our way through this, we will be able 
to adapt additional legislation, if re-
quired, to meet with the needs at that 
time. As I said, this has been a moving 
target. 
I appreciate the cooperation we have 
seen so far. I think, as we all realize, 
there are some things that transcend 
politics. Every time we have had a na-
tional 
crisis—this 
one 
included—I 
think it has always called the better 
angels of our nature and resulted in 
our ability to work together to produce 
our best efforts to help address the cri-
sis, to solve the problem, and to help 
the American people. 
Each day we waste debating this bill 
further by talking about other ideolog-
ical goals that people want to accom-
plish and take advantage of this emer-
gency to try to pass things that are un-
related to dealing with the virus— 
every day we waste with those sorts of 
things is a day that healthcare pro-
viders, small businesses, and constitu-
ents are spending without the help 
they need and deserve. 
The time to act is now. There is no 
question that this pandemic will have a 
lasting impact on our country. I be-
lieve one of the things we need to do is 
figure out how we can prevent this sort 
of thing from happening ever again. 
But I believe a major investment by 
our government will now allow us to 
weather the storm together and to 
come out with the best possible result 
on the other side. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1889 
March 21, 2020 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to provide an 
update on the bold, bipartisan action 
Congress is taking to respond to the 
pandemic 
we 
have 
with 
the 
coronavirus. 
First, we are all deeply saddened by 
the loss of life due to the outbreak in 
this country and globally. I know, Mr. 
President, it has affected your State in 
terms of disease as well as death; in my 
State, disease, not yet death, and we 
are hoping to prevent that. All of us re-
main very concerned about the great 
loss of life and the suffering that is 
happening as a result of this. 
These are extraordinary times. We 
are fighting a world war to defeat a 
virus. We want to do it to save lives 
but also to keep people safe. 
This war has two fronts. Mr. Presi-
dent, I know you discussed these on 
television the other evening. I listened 
carefully about the impact on your 
State. As you said, we are fighting on 
the front of public health as well as the 
health of our economy. 
The coronavirus right now is control-
ling our economy. It has taken a domi-
nant role. To stop this disease, the Na-
tion has largely shut down. 
These temporary restrictions on our 
daily activities are necessary in an ef-
fort to limit new cases and the spread 
of the disease. Yet the economic fall-
out is devastating millions of hard- 
working American families. Once we 
defeat the virus, we will rebuild. Our 
economy will bounce back. We are a 
strong and resilient Nation, and we al-
ways bounce back, and we will again. 
First, we need to make it through 
this medical crisis. This is going to re-
quire big and bold and bipartisan ac-
tion. The American people need help. I 
would reassure the American people 
that Congress is responding. This is a 
national rescue operation, as I see it, 
and help is on the way. 
President Trump and Congress are 
coming together in a bipartisan way to 
ease the pain of the American people. 
It is going to take time. It is going to 
happen. We are sending immediate re-
lief, and we have done that. We are 
sending financial support—plus med-
ical 
support—to 
people 
all 
across 
America. 
The bill being considered on the floor 
right now is called the CARES Act. It 
stands for Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act. It will bolster 
our economy, and it will help working 
families. This bill allows us to deliver 
direct cash payments to most Ameri-
cans to see people through this eco-
nomic downturn. People who work in 
small businesses and people who own 
small businesses will receive federally 
guaranteed loans to help them stay 
viable and keep their businesses viable 
so that they can keep their employees 
on the payroll until we get to a point 
where they are—from a disease stand-
point—able to reopen the businesses. 
We want them to be viable when the 
day comes that businesses can reopen 
all across America. 
The CARES Act is major legislation 
that will stabilize our economy and 
protect American jobs. It also includes 
critical new support for our healthcare 
workers and for patients. 
I have introduced bipartisan CARES 
Act language, along with Senator MI-
CHAEL BENNET of Colorado, with regard 
to healthcare. The goal is to provide 
immediate relief for rural hospitals, for 
small community hospitals, and for 
small physician practices. During this 
crisis, 
rural 
hospitals 
and 
small 
healthcare 
providers 
are 
on 
the 
frontlines, providing urgent care. They 
continue to work around-the-clock, 
keeping communities in Wyoming and 
across the country safe. 
These providers are stretched like 
never before. I have talked with several 
of them in Wyoming over the past 24 
hours. I talked to one this morning 
whose coronavirus test has come back. 
It is negative, and he is back in the 
fight today in the hospital. 
Our bill provides rural hospitals with 
aid in the form of Federal grants based 
on insurance payments. This will help 
make up for lost revenue due to the 
forced cancellation of elective sur-
geries. Of course, these are surgeries 
that have already been scheduled and 
planned for patients needing surgeries. 
Yet, in terms of providing and making 
sure we have the resources needed at 
those hospitals—the beds available and 
personal protective equipment—elec-
tive surgeries have been canceled. 
Small physician practices, hospitals, 
and rural communities aren’t able to 
tolerate that sort of loss of flow, just 
as any business is not able to tolerate 
that sort of cashflow loss. 
Small physician practices will re-
ceive low-interest loans based on the 
payroll of that practice in terms of 
what we are doing with this bill that 
MICHAEL BENNET and I—in a bipartisan 
way—have 
introduced. 
Rural 
healthcare workers need immediate, 
short-term financial relief to help 
them through this crisis time. 
The CARES Act also includes a num-
ber of important public health provi-
sions. Our bill eases the shortage of 
drugs and critical equipment, including 
ventilators and medical masks. It ex-
pands testing and ensures testing is 
free for patients, and it speeds the de-
velopment of new coronavirus vaccines 
and treatments since none have existed 
before the disease was made known 
worldwide as a new virus, which it is. 
The CARES Act that we are at look-
ing today on the floor of the Senate 
also protects patients through the ex-
panded use of health savings accounts 
for telehealth. It expands telehealth 
access for Medicare patients. It in-
creases Medicare payments to hospitals 
treating coronavirus patients. 
The CARES Act will help employers 
and workers weather the storm that we 
are facing because of coronavirus. Once 
the storm passes, you know, as do I, 
that the American economy will con-
tinue to recover. 
The 
CARES 
Act 
is 
the 
third 
coronavirus emergency bill considered 
in the Senate. The first two have al-
ready been passed into law, signed by 
the President. Earlier this month, Con-
gress passed two major relief packages: 
the first, an $8 billion emergency fund-
ing bill for our healthcare system; the 
second, a $100 billion bill to provide ad-
ditional relief to affected families, to 
small businesses, and to workers. 
These three relief measures are only 
the beginning. More legislation will be 
coming to address this unprecedented 
economic and public healthcare crisis. 
Once we defeat the virus, the economy 
will recover; America will be back. The 
American people are strong. We are re-
silient. We are determined to get 
through this, and we will. We are all 
Americans. We are all in it together. 
Be assured that Congress will stop at 
nothing to ensure that America and 
Americans survive and revive and 
thrive. This storm will pass. The people 
of 
this 
great 
Nation 
will 
emerge 
stronger than ever. Americans will de-
feat the coronavirus together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 1562. Mr. HAWLEY submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 3548, to provide emer-
gency assistance and health care re-
sponse for individuals, families, and 
businesses 
affected 
by 
the 
2020 
coronavirus pandemic; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Finance; as 
follows: 
In section 2101, strike subsection (a) and 
insert the following: 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subchapter B of chapter 
65 of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 is amended by inserting after section 
6427 the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 6428. 2020 RECOVERY REBATES FOR INDI-
VIDUALS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—In the case of an eligible 
individual, there shall be allowed as a credit 
against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the 
first taxable year beginning in 2020 an 
amount equal to $1,200 ($2,400 in the case of 
a joint return). 
‘‘(b) CHILD BENEFIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
described in paragraph (2), the amount deter-
mined under subsection (a) shall be increased 
by the product of $500 multiplied by the 
number of qualifying children (within the 
meaning of section 24(c)) of the taxpayer. 
‘‘(2) TAXPAYER DESCRIBED.—A taxpayer is 
described in this paragraph if the taxpayer— 
‘‘(A) is a resident of the United States of 
America, and 
‘‘(B) has a valid Social Security number or 
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. 
‘‘(c) TREATMENT OF CREDIT.—The credit al-
lowed by subsection (a) shall be treated as 
allowed by subpart C of part IV of sub-
chapter A of chapter 1. 
‘‘(d) LIMITATION BASED ON ADJUSTED GROSS 
INCOME.—The amount of the credit allowed 
by subsection (a) (determined without regard 
to this subsection and subsection (f)) shall be 
reduced (but not below zero) by 5 percent of 
so much of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross in-
come as exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 in the case 
of a joint return). 
‘‘(e) ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL.—The term ‘eligi-
ble individual’ means any individual other 
than— 
‘‘(1) any nonresident alien individual, 
‘‘(2) any individual with respect to whom a 
deduction under section 151 is allowable to 
another taxpayer for a taxable year begin-
ning in the calendar year in which the indi-
vidual’s taxable year begins, and 
‘‘(3) an estate or trust. 
‘‘(f) COORDINATION WITH ADVANCE REFUNDS 
OF CREDIT.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The amount of credit 
which would (but for this paragraph) be al-
lowable under this section shall be reduced 
(but not below zero) by the aggregate refunds 
and credits made or allowed to the taxpayer 
under subsection (g). Any failure to so re-
duce the credit shall be treated as arising 
out of a mathematical or clerical error and 
assessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) JOINT RETURNS.—In the case of a re-
fund or credit made or allowed under sub-
section (g) with respect to a joint return, 
half of such refund or credit shall be treated 
as having been made or allowed to each indi-
vidual filing such return. 
‘‘(g) ADVANCE REFUNDS AND CREDITS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (5), 
each individual who was an eligible indi-
vidual for such individual’s first taxable year 
beginning in 2018 shall be treated as having 
made a payment against the tax imposed by 
chapter 1 for such first taxable year in an 
amount equal to the advance refund amount 
for such taxable year. 
‘‘(2) ADVANCE
REFUND
AMOUNT.—For pur-
poses of paragraph (1), the advance refund 
amount is the amount that would have been 
allowed as a credit under this section for 
such first taxable year if this section (other 
than subsection (f) and this subsection) had 
applied to such taxable year. 
‘‘(3) TIMING OF PAYMENTS.—The Secretary 
shall, subject to the provisions of this title, 
refund or credit any overpayment attrib-
