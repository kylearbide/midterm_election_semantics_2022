CONGRATULATING SERGEANT 
MAJOR RICK CALDWELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Sergeant Major Rick 
Caldwell for receiving the Silver Hel-
met 
Award 
presented 
during 
the 
AMVETS 76th national convention. 
The Silver Helmet Award is given to 
those for their excellent and out-
standing accomplishment in Ameri-
canism, defense, rehabilitation, and 
congressional and civil service. 
In 2002, Sergeant Major Caldwell 
helped bring back the AMVETS post to 
Camp Atterbury. 
After serving in the U.S. Army for 32 
years, Sergeant Major Rick Caldwell 
resigned as a reservist in 2008. 
Sergeant Major Rick Caldwell has 
committed his life to serving this 
country and his community in our 
hometown of Columbus, Indiana. I am 
honored to call Rick my friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Sergeant 
Major Rick Caldwell on this award and 
thank him for his service. 
CELEBRATING THE UNITED STATES MARINE 
CORPS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate 246 years of service by the 
United States Marine Corps. 
Founded on November 10, 1775, before 
our Nation was established, the Ma-
rines stood ready to win our country’s 
hardest battles and never back down. 
Marines are guided by our core values 
of honor, courage, and commitment. 
Even when the United States has 
faced tremendous odds in the war to 
preserve our freedom, like Iwo Jima, 
the Marines have answered the call to 
always remain faithful. 
As a marine whose greatest honor it 
has been to serve our Nation and to 
those who have served and continue to 
serve: Oorah. Semper fi. 
CONGRATULATING COLUMBUS NORTH GIRLS 
CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Columbus North 
girls cross-country team on winning 
the State championship this past week-
end. 
This marks the second State title for 
the Bull Dogs, and I congratulate each 
of these young student-athletes, head 
coach Rick Sluder, and the entire team 
on a job well done. 
Furthermore, the Columbus North 
boys also finished third as a team in 
the State finals, while Reese Kilbarger- 
Stumpff claimed overall victory in the 
boys’ race. 
Having each of my four children par-
ticipate in cross-country at Columbus 
North, I know these accomplishments 
stand as a true reflection of their out-
standing program. 
It is great to see the Bull Dogs back 
on top again. 
RECOGNIZING MAYOR CHUCK FEWELL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the hard work and dedica-
tion of Greenfield Mayor Chuck Fewell 
as he has announced his retirement. 
A fellow marine, Chuck’s career 
started in law enforcement as a mem-
ber of the Shelbyville Police Depart-
ment before moving on to become an 
Indiana State Trooper. 
When there was a vacancy to serve as 
mayor, Chuck stepped up and answered 
the call, serving his neighbors in the 
community for nearly a decade. 
Today, I congratulate Chuck on his 
many years of dedication to making 
Greenfield such a great place. I know I 
speak for many when I say he will be 
dearly missed at city hall. 
On behalf of Indiana’s Sixth District, 
we wish Mayor Fewell a peaceful re-
tirement enjoying time with his wife, 
Kristen, 
four 
kids, 
and 
seven 
grandkids. 
NUMBERS DON’T LIE 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to note the U.S. GDP has dropped to a 
disappointing 2 percent in the third 
quarter. 
Thanksgiving 2021 is expected to be 
the most expensive in the history of 
the holiday, a Turkey tax year. 
Americans are being warned that 
their Christmas presents will cost more 
this year and might not arrive on time. 
Numbers don’t lie. Democrats’ out- 
of-control spending and far-left social-
ist policies are to blame for the supply 
chain and economic crisis America is 
facing. 
It is clear: The Democrats’ liberal 
agenda is out of touch with Hoosier 
values and out of touch with America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6074 
November 2, 2021 
SOARING AMERICAN ENERGY COSTS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight the energy crisis that my 
Hoosiers and all Americans are facing. 
This week, President Biden jetted off 
to Glasgow to rub shoulders with world 
dignitaries and to take a nap. 
American energy costs are soaring 
while he is sleeping, and the bottom 
line is this: This administration needs 
to worry less about their image and 
more about how Hoosiers can keep 
their lights on, heat their homes this 
winter, and afford to fill up their gas 
tanks. 
f 
EARTH SCIENCE LESSON ON 
EVAPOTRANSPIRATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise 
today 
to 
talk 
about 
evapotranspiration. 
Perhaps you are not used to getting a 
mini Earth science lesson on the floor 
of the House, but hear me out for a 
minute. 
Nevada boasts 300 sunny days a year. 
It is great for hiking and biking, not so 
great when it comes to precipitation 
and our growing severe drought. But 
we can’t just rely on precipitation data 
in understanding our drought because 
we are losing water with all of our 
sunny days. 
Evapotranspiration, or ET, is the 
combination of water lost through 
evaporation from the land and tran-
spiration from plants. It is a critical 
measurement that we need to plan for 
the future of western water. 
Until recently, and frankly, to my 
surprise, water managers could not ac-
cess this data. But a group of sci-
entists, academics, advocacy organiza-
tions, and even corporations are work-
ing to change that. 
OpenET is filling the biggest data 
gap in water management by giving ev-
eryone access to ET data, and I mean 
everyone. You can Google it and pull it 
right up on your computer. 
From water managers, to utility pro-
viders, to farmers and ranchers, to con-
servationists, this data will help folks 
across the West make better water de-
cisions to protect our most vital re-
source for decades to come. 
That is exactly why I have intro-
duced the bipartisan, bicameral Open 
Access Evapotranspiration Act with 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO to fill these 
critical data gaps and inform drought 
solutions across the West. 
I am all in when it comes to finding 
solutions for Nevada’s drought. We 
must explore every option and make 
these investments before it is too late. 
THE TIME IS NOW TO LOWER DRUG PRICES 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as we continue to negotiate 
the Build Back Better Act. 
When I ran for Congress, I promised 
my constituents that I would do every-
thing to fight for lower drug prices. 
Over and over again in townhalls, I 
hear from my constituents that they 
are so extremely worried about how 
they are going to pay for prescription 
drugs. In fact, one in five seniors re-
ports not taking their medicines as 
prescribed because of the cost. I have 
even heard from constituents who say 
they skip meals so they can afford the 
prescriptions 
they 
need 
to 
stay 
healthy. 
This is outrageous. I urge my col-
leagues to address this problem with 
the urgency it deserves. 
With the Build Back Better agenda, 
we have a once-in-a-generation oppor-
tunity to change the status quo and 
make good on our promise that no one 
should have to choose between afford-
ing their prescription drugs, or putting 
food on the table, or paying rent. 
We must enact legislation to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. The 
time is now. Our constituents all over 
this country are counting on us. 
f 
NCAA SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to speak about something that 
plays a special role in American life, 
and that is college athletics. 
College sports is ingrained in our cul-
ture, and its impact is far-reaching on 
student-athletes, alumni, and their 
fans. 
For decades, college athletics have 
been governed by the National Colle-
giate Athletic Association, more com-
monly known as the NCAA. The NCAA 
has tremendous power, really omnipo-
tent power over college athletics. The 
NCAA decides the rules of play, who 
gets to play, and who gets the revenue. 
Now, the NCAA investigates and pe-
nalizes any school, coach, or student- 
athlete that it claims infringes on its 
rules. This is what the NCAA calls the 
infractions process. 
Let’s be clear. The NCAA infraction 
process is systemically and fundamen-
tally flawed. The NCAA’s rules are 
vague, constantly changing, and irreg-
ularly enforced. The NCAA’s investiga-
tions lack transparency and estab-
lished procedures and are performed 
while universities are often kept in the 
dark. 
Fundamentally, there is no due proc-
ess for member schools nor for their 
students. The NCAA investigations can 
last years, and they cost universities 
millions of dollars in legal fees and 
other expenses. 
Finally, the NCAA punishes univer-
sities and student-athletes with no 
consistency and no predictability. The 
NCAA may decide to punish one school 
but not another. 
Without a doubt, the NCAA acts with 
little regard for fairness, due process, 
or transparency. Through its monopo-
listic power and lack of oversight, the 
NCAA has caused irreparable damage 
to athletic departments, to colleges, 
and to universities across the Nation. 
That is why today I am introducing 
the NCAA Accountability Act with my 
colleagues, Representatives BURGESS 
OWENS and JOSH HARDER. 
This bipartisan legislation will estab-
lish due process protections for any 
athlete, university, or individual going 
through the NCAA infraction process. 
These protections include fair notice 
on enforcement proceedings, a defined 
statute of limitations, and a deadline 
for the completion of investigations. 
The NCAA Accountability Act also 
includes mechanisms to ensure that 
NCAA sanctions are equitable and fit 
the alleged infraction. 
Universities will have the right to re-
solve punishment disputes with the 
NCAA through binding arbitration. 
This will bring an independent, unbi-
ased voice into the process to ensure 
that an equitable outcome is obtained. 
If the NCAA fails to comply with 
these obligations, the Department of 
Justice will have the authority to fine 
the NCAA and its staff, and the Depart-
ment of Justice will have the power to 
permanently remove any member from 
the NCAA Board of Governors. 
For our universities and our student- 
athletes, it is vital that Congress end 
the NCAA’s long reign as prosecutor, 
judge, jury, and executioner over col-
lege athletics. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important, bipartisan legislation that 
will finally hold the NCAA account-
able. 
f 
LOWERING COSTS OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, years ago, I 
began running for Congress because I 
believed that hardworking Americans 
shouldn’t have to pay three times what 
people in other countries pay for the 
same exact medicines. 
I ran for Congress because I believed 
that none of our constituents should 
have to pay $20,000 a year for insulin, a 
medication they quite literally cannot 
live without. 
I ran for Congress because I believe 
that Minnesotans deserve a Represent-
ative who will fight to lower the cost of 
drugs, even in the face of millions of 
dollars in attack ads funded by Big 
Pharma. 
My fellow colleagues, this week we 
have a real opportunity to make a dif-
ference in our constituents’ lives, to 
save American families thousands of 
hard-earned dollars every single year, 
while finally standing up to an indus-
try that has raked in record-breaking 
profits at the expense of hardworking 
Americans. 
b 1015 
We cannot allow this opportunity to 
pass us by. 
Empowering Medicare to negotiate 
drug prices would not only grant long 
overdue relief to struggling constitu-
ents but save the American taxpayers 
billions of dollars annually.

H6075 
November 2, 2021 
We may not get everything we want-
ed in this package, but we must take 
the power back from Big Pharma. Big 
Pharma has had way too much power 
over this town for way too long. This is 
our opportunity to demonstrate to our 
constituents that we work for them, 
not for Big Pharma. We cannot return 
to our districts without delivering on 
our promise to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
do what is right and fight for these 
critical provisions in the Build Back 
Better Act. 
f 
HURLEY FLOOD RESCUE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I offer 
these remarks today to honor the brav-
ery and selfless service of the law en-
forcement officers and other first re-
sponders that worked to ensure the 
safety of the residents of Buchanan 
County during the horrendous flooding 
caused by heavy rainfall in the small 
town of Hurley, Virginia, on August 30, 
2021. 
Their efforts saved lives and were 
core to rescue and recovery following 
the destructive power of the flood. Par-
ticularly, I honor Buchanan County 
Sheriff John McClanahan, Deputy Ray-
mond Webb, Deputy Lieutenant Bran-
don Hall, Deputy Lieutenant Ryan 
Mitchell, Deputy Billy Owens, Deputy 
Aaron Skeens, Deputy Andy Webb, 
Deputy John Hagy III, and Deputy 
Tasha Meadows. 
The excessive rainfall resulted in 
blocked 
roadways, 
numerous 
land-
slides, and severe flooding in the town 
of Hurley. There were school closures 
from the storm as well. All of this 
caused devastating damage and jeop-
ardized the safety of many. 
In the face of danger, these officers 
and first responders of Buchanan Coun-
ty displayed great heroism by rescuing 
a number of citizens from harm’s way. 
The storm caused a level of flooding in 
Hurley which has not been seen for 
nearly 20 years and matched any level 
of devastation from a natural disaster 
that I have seen in the Ninth Congres-
sional District of Virginia. 
Hundreds of residents had to evac-
uate their homes. As many as a thou-
sand were left without power and 
drinking water, and I saw roughly 20 
homes that had been uprooted from 
their foundations. But the terrible 
flood was also an occasion of heroism 
and helping others. Besides the depu-
ties and the sheriff, around 500 volun-
teers lent their time to rescue and 
cleanup efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, let me highlight one re-
markable rescue from the flooding on 
Monday, August 30, 2021, involving a 
woman trapped in her home. 
The woman’s mobile home had been 
swept off its foundation, carried down-
stream, and when it crashed into a rail-
road trestle, the home, with the woman 
inside of it, was caught between the 
raging water and the train trestle. The 
home would have continued further 
downstream if it had not been trapped 
at the trestle. And as officers quickly 
arrived on the scene, her home was al-
ready little more than rubble. 
As the water thundered by and the 
rain continued to pour down, the trail-
er, surrounded by water, was precar-
iously positioned and appeared ready 
to collapse completely at any moment. 
Amid this peril, the officers showed no 
regard for their own safety as they 
came to the rescue. 
Deputy Raymond Webb was first to 
arrive on the scene. He crossed the rail-
road tracks, climbed over to where the 
collapsed home remained, with water 
raging around, and was able to cut a 
hole in the roof of what was left of the 
house. 
Shortly 
after, 
Sheriff 
John 
McClanahan 
and 
Deputies 
Skeens, 
Meadows, Hall, Mitchell, Owens, Webb, 
and Hagy arrived at the scene to assist 
with the rescue. Deputy Raymond 
Webb tied a rope around the woman, 
while the rest of the officers and per-
sonnel retrieved her and pulled her out 
of the trailer and up to safety. Thanks 
to the rapid response of these officers 
from the Buchanan County Sheriff’s 
Office, she was rescued from the bat-
tered trailer. 
Mr. Speaker, this storm was dev-
astating for the town of Hurley. In a 
time when the community was in great 
need, these officers courageously came 
together to do their utmost to ensure 
the safety and security of those who 
were in harm’s way. 
I offer my gratitude to the officers 
from the Buchanan County Sheriff’s 
Office, as well as all the community 
leaders and first responders that played 
a hand in keeping Hurley safe on that 
day and the days that followed. 
f 
TIPS FOR PREVENTING SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Ms. BUSH) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise, many of us being survivors 
of sexual harassment and violence, be-
cause we are tired of victim blaming. 
We are tired of being told that if we 
had just done this or done that it 
wouldn’t have happened to us. We are 
tired of being told to feel guilty about 
what we wore or what we said. We are 
tired of our truth being dismissed. 
Today, I rise to change the narrative 
and give some tips instead for how to 
prevent sexual violence. So let’s talk 
about it. 
If you are thinking about putting 
drugs in someone’s drink, don’t. 
If you can’t keep yourself from com-
mitting sexual assault, always have a 
trusted friend by your side to stop you 
from committing sexual assault. 
If you encounter someone who is 
drunk, unconscious or asleep, do not 
commit sexual assault against that 
person. 
If you see someone walking by them-
selves, just leave them alone. 
If you are worried about committing 
sexual assault, make sure you wear 
something that will remind you not to, 
like a sign or a sticker. 
If you think you might commit sex-
ual assault, always carry a whistle. 
When you find yourself about to com-
mit sexual assault, blow the whistle 
until someone else stops you. 
To every survivor of sexual violence, 
know that no matter how hard the 
media or your peers or your family or 
others try to make you feel that what 
happened to you was your fault, it was 
not. 
Hear me when I say this: It was not 
your fault. 
Know that your congresswoman is 
working every day to build a world 
where sexual violence no longer exists, 
a world where survivors are protected, 
where we have access to the care that 
we need, which includes abortion care, 
a world where the instinct to blame the 
survivors is replaced with one to pro-
vide healing and care. 
Know that in this moment that I love 
you and that there are others who love 
you and want to make sure you are 
healthy, and you are protected. We see 
you. We hear you. We love you. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the advocates 
for giving us all these great tips. 
f 
PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM A 
POROUS BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, be-
fore my commentary on this disastrous 
border self-inflicted by this adminis-
tration, I want to speak on behalf of 
my fellow Texans. 
I think I can say this with con-
fidence: They welcome the immigrant, 
the God-fearing, freedom-loving immi-
grant that wants to make this country 
their home, pledge allegiance to our 
flag, embrace our ideals and improve 
even our way of life. 
Mr. Speaker, we welcome the immi-
grant, but only if they respect our 
laws, our sovereignty, and the safety of 
our fellow Americans. 
Since January, this administration 
has created an unprecedented and un-
mitigated crisis at our southern bor-
der. They have repealed every effective 
measure that was in place to stop the 
flow of illegal Americans and to secure 
the border. They have willfully dis-
regarded the Constitution and its man-
date on the people’s government to 
provide for the common defense. 
Our President has failed to faithfully 
uphold the law, to fulfill the sacred 
duty to enforce the laws of the land. 
They have completely ceded control of 
our border and the sovereignty of this 
great country to paramilitary drug 
cartels. They have enriched, empow-
ered, these narco terrorists at the ex-
pense of the vulnerable migrants who 
take this dangerous trek and, most im-
portantly, at the expense of the Amer-
ican people, our families, our children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6076 
November 2, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, this administration has 
intentionally opened up our border to a 
flood of human trafficking, unprece-
dented drug smuggling, and a record 
amount of crime and gang activity. 
There is no apology for it. There is no 
recognition of it. There seems to be no 
sign of changing the posture and poli-
cies of this administration. There is no 
accountability. They are not com-
mitted to detaining and deporting. 
Mr. Speaker, they are catching and 
releasing, there is lawlessness, chaos, 
and a border beyond recognition. This 
central tenet of catch and release has 
not only rewarded illegal immigration, 
but it has dispersed this crisis beyond 
our border to every State in the United 
States, making every State a border 
State. 
Since March, 160,000 illegal immi-
grants have been released into the 
United States. This, in addition to al-
most a half a million got-aways. 
Mr. Speaker, I recently learned that 
folks who were being detained, illegal 
immigrants, were being released into 
neighborhoods in communities in my 
district. They couldn’t tell me how 
many. They couldn’t tell me where 
they came from. They couldn’t tell me 
who was going to follow up, when they 
would show up for court. They had 
nothing. They could confirm, however, 
that there were people being released, 
illegal immigrants, into our commu-
nities who were COVID positive, and 
some who had criminal records. No-
body notified. Not me, not our gov-
ernor, no local officials—just releasing 
folks. 
Meanwhile, this administration is 
mandating and insisting on vaccines 
and public health protocols, but letting 
folks just stream into our country. 
They say one of every five illegal im-
migrants crossing is COVID positive, 
and so there is this public safety threat 
of another surge inundating our hos-
pitals while they force their policies on 
the American people in this regard. 
Shameful. 
And there has been an exponential 
increase 
in 
criminal 
aliens 
appre-
hended at the border. These are folks 
who have committed a crime on our 
soil who have crossed back over—four 
times 
as 
much 
criminal 
activity, 
criminal aliens. 
Mr. Speaker, the numbers are star-
tling: 348 percent increase in criminal 
aliens convicted of DUIs coming back 
to the United States; 454 percent in-
crease in criminal aliens convicted of 
drug possession; 477 percent increase in 
robbery, theft, burglary; over 200 per-
cent increase in sex offenses, and over 
1600 percent increase in criminal aliens 
who have come over to our country and 
committed murder.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Ms. Kaitlyn 
Roberts, one of his secretaries. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
POWELL HOLDING, III 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Robert Powell 
Holding, III, of Wilmington, North 
Carolina. Thomas Jefferson once said, 
‘‘God who gave us life gave us liberty.’’ 
North Carolina is fortunate to have 
an embodiment of this American spirit 
in Robert Holding, III, who is con-
tinuing his battle against pancreatic 
cancer by working on a new E.A. Mor-
ris/Robert P. Holding Pancreatic Can-
cer Research Fund. 
Mr. Speaker, I first met Robert, or 
‘‘Robbie’’, as so many of his closest 
friends and family in our home county 
of Johnston call him, when I was a 
teenager working on our family farm 
during the summers. 
He drove up in his pickup, with his 
wrist resting on top of the steering— 
the window rolled down, of course. I 
don’t know how I can recall that detail 
so vividly and not remember the exact 
year, but I think I was about 13 or 14. 
He had stopped by the shop there at 
the farm to visit with my uncle for a 
bit. They talked weather and the crops 
and the latest news in the county for a 
good 30 minutes, maybe longer. 
b 1030 
Now, that wasn’t the first time I had 
seen a neighboring farmer come by in 
their pickup to talk, but it was the 
first time I had ever met a Holding. I 
had heard about the family for years— 
arguably the most influential family in 
Johnston County and eastern North 
Carolina—but I had never met one 
until that day. Years later we would be 
neighbors at McGee’s Crossroads in 
Johnston County and in Wilmington as 
well. 
Former U.S. Senator Lauch Fair-
cloth said it best when he wrote about 
Robert Holding: Robert, you are one of 
the strongest people of faith I know. 
Lauch went on: I remember launching 
my campaign in your living room. You 
have been in the top leadership for 
Reagan in 1980, Senator Jesse Helms, 
myself, Senator Dole, and others. 
My dear friend and former Congress-
man George Holding added: I watched 
my older brother work hard for years, 
building businesses in manufacturing, 
media, real estate, and finance. And I 
watched him tirelessly give back to his 
family and community. 
I have personally seen firsthand how 
Robert Holding’s hard work, men-
toring, and insightful mind inspires 
others. He has helped make our State 
and Nation a much better place. 
From the Nutcracker Company to 
vice president of promotional whole-
sale; 
from 
founder 
and 
CEO 
of 
Carolantic Communications and RP In-
dustries; to founding Reedy Branch 
Farms, Robert has worked to be a con-
tributor to his community. 
From founder and CEO of Allied 
Communications, Delta Broadcasting 
and WKFT-TV, to CFB Construction 
Company, Jefferson Marketing, RP 
Holding Realty, the Coalition for Free-
dom, and the Vance Young Team at In-
tracoastal Realty, Robert has provided 
love, leadership, and jobs to employees 
and owners. 
From 
Americans 
for 
Reagan 
to 
Helms, Faircloth, Dole, Leo Daughtry, 
the Congressional Club, and so many 
others, Robert Holding is a visionary 
business leader who stands for what he 
believes. 
You can see his kind heart in how he 
continues to give back to our commu-
nity locally through his nonprofit 
work, and by his help to champion to 
E.A. Morris Cancer Center at Duke 
University. He is helping lead projects 
in Johnston County to strengthen 
Providence Presbyterian Church, ex-
pand LifeSpring Academy, and support 
Friendship Baptist Church, as well as 
his work with the Wilmington Boys 
and Girls Club, and leadership of Mon-
day night Bible study. 
He has also worked tirelessly to 
champion wildlife conservation across 
North Carolina with legendary con-
servationist Eddie Bridges. His vision 
for the Eddie C. Bridges, Robert P. 
Holding Black Creek Youth for Christ 
Wildlife Habitat Conservation Grounds 
will help future generations value our 
amazing natural sources. 
Like his father and grandfather be-
fore him, Robert Holding, III, is an ex-
ample of the American spirit that 
makes this country great; the spirit of 
faith, family, and community; the spir-
it to be the best we can be and to help 
others. 
God bless you, Robert, and thank 
you. May God bless your wife, Pam; 
your children, Bob and Amy; your six 
grandchildren; your brothers, Frank 
and George; your sister, Jane; and all 
those whose lives you continue to 
touch. 
Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to 
know Robert and to recognize him 
today.

WASHINGTON’S SPENDING 
ADDICTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, Washington, 
in fact, has a spending addiction. We 
doubled our spending last year to fight 
the pandemic, protect public health, 
and get the economy back open and 
protect jobs. On top of that, this 
spring, Democrats spent another $1.9 
trillion on extra spending. 
Now my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are further fueling this ad-
diction and just can’t take their foot 
off the gas. We are headed downhill 
with no brakes. They continue to push 
forward with what amounts to another 
$5.5 
trillion 
tax-and-spending 
spree 
that is nothing more than a Trojan 
horse filled with tax hikes for Amer-
ican families and far-left, progressive 
priorities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6077 
November 2, 2021 
We need to abandon this reckless 
spending and come together in a bipar-
tisan way and put together a common-
sense 2022 budget plan before we burden 
our children and grandchildren with 
further debt. 
HEATING BILLS JUMP 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, winter is 
right around the corner and households 
could see their heating bills jump 54 
percent. While some of this can be at-
tributed to our supply chain issues, the 
administration’s 
spending 
addiction 
coupled with their anti-American en-
ergy policies aren’t helping. 
At every turn, the Biden administra-
tion has hindered domestic energy pro-
duction. They halted construction on 
the Keystone XL pipeline, costing jobs 
in my home State of Arkansas and 
throughout the Midwest. They halted 
new oil and gas leasing on U.S. lands 
and waters, costing 1 million American 
jobs in the near term. Now they are 
pushing a heat-your-home tax in their 
tax-and-spending spree. 
Mr. Speaker, the holidays are around 
the corner and Americans will unfortu-
nately bear the burden of President 
Biden’s 
ill-conceived, 
anti-American 
energy policies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the administra-
tion to end their war on American jobs 
and our energy independence. 
RECOGNIZING 2021 ARKANSAS HISTORY TEACHER 
OF THE YEAR KRISTY BRASFIELD 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize Kristy Brasfield, the 2021 
Arkansas History Teacher of the Year. 
Mrs. Brasfield earned her bachelor 
and master’s degree in education from 
Arkansas 
State 
University 
at 
Jonesboro and is currently working on 
her doctorate. 
Currently, 
Mrs. 
Brasfield 
teaches 
U.S. history and English IV at the Joe 
T. Robinson High School in Pulaski 
County. 
To those who know her, this award is 
no surprise. Her hard work and dedica-
tion have been previously rewarded, 
winning the 2019 Arkansas Council for 
Social Studies 9 through 12 Teacher of 
the Year and the 2016 Rotary Educator 
of the Year. 
Mrs. Brasfield, on behalf of all the 
parents in central Arkansas, I thank 
you for your hard work, your dedica-
tion to your students, and congratulate 
you on this meaningful award. 
RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT 
OF JULIA GAFFNEY 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding achieve-
ment of Julia Gaffney of Mayflower, 
Arkansas. This summer she won the 
bronze medal in the 400 meter freestyle 
and the bronze medal in the 100 meter 
backstroke at the Tokyo Paralympics. 
Julia has been swimming competi-
tively since 2015, and quickly has made 
a name for herself. This year was her 
first Paralympic appearance, and it 
was an awe-inspiring achievement. 
Julia’s path to being a Paralympic 
medalist was unlike any other. After a 
setback in this year’s games, she said: 
I had to move on, and I am so happy 
that I was able to bounce back and 
earn a bronze for Team USA. 
I admire Julia’s courage and deter-
mination, which are the characteristics 
that led her to that Paralympic po-
dium. Julia, you make Mayflower and 
all of central Arkansas proud. 
FULLER & SON HARDWARE MARKS 100 YEARS OF 
BUSINESS 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the remarkable accom-
plishment of Fuller & Son Hardware 
for marking 100 years of business in 
central Arkansas. 
Fuller & Son Hardware originally 
started as a feed store operated by Wal-
ter ‘‘Pop’’ Fuller at the corner of 28th 
and Arch Streets in Little Rock in 1921. 
Over the past 100 years, Fuller & Son 
Hardware has weathered the storm of 
change. They have expanded to include 
hardware and added five locations in 
central 
Arkansas. 
They 
are 
now 
launching an online shopping option. 
All that by remaining closed on Sun-
days. The founder said, ‘‘Some money 
just costs too much.’’ 
Congratulations on the centennial 
for Fuller & Son Hardware. 
f 
TURKEY DAY TAX HIKE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, this Thanks-
giving will be the most expensive on 
record, and Americans have the Biden 
administration to thank. 
Put yourself in the shoes of hard-
working 
families 
across 
America. 
Every morning they wake up and leave 
for work. The moment their feet touch 
the ground outside, inflation is already 
reaching for their wallets. They turn 
on their cars and head to the gas sta-
tion where inflation is ready and wait-
ing for them. At the grocery store, in-
flation is lurking within the aisles. 
It is a sobering reality for so many 
working families, and people are right-
fully angry. I share their anger. 
Mr. Speaker, consider what these 
working 
families 
are 
thinking 
as 
Thanksgiving approaches. Will they be 
able to afford President Biden’s turkey 
tax on Thanksgiving dinner? Will they 
even be able to get themselves to the 
grocery store in time before the shelves 
are empty? Will they even be able to 
get to the grocery store at all because 
of rising gas prices? 
Consider this: Thanksgiving dinner 
this year is estimated to cost 4 to 5 
percent more for American families, 
and that is assuming they will be able 
to put food on the table. 
Just this morning I did an interview 
with a local radio station in the Fifth 
District. The host remarked to me that 
under the Biden administration we are 
going to have to get used to empty 
shelves and rising prices. I take great 
issue with where the direction of this 
country is headed under this adminis-
tration. 
Americans have been told to ‘‘lower 
their expectations’’ and to get used to 
doing with less. No, we won’t. This is 
America, and we do not settle for less. 
We are better than meeting meager ex-
pectations, lowering the bar, and ex-
pecting less. That is just not who we 
are as a country, and it certainly is not 
who we are as a people. 
Let’s not forget that this administra-
tion touted an alleged savings of 16 
cents for family barbecues over the 
Independence Day weekend earlier this 
year. Nobody took that claim seriously 
then, and it certainly does not hold up 
now. 
From President Biden’s turkey tax to 
rising gas prices, empty store shelves 
to rising costs of heating homes during 
the winter, everyone is feeling the 
squeeze of inflation. This is not a high- 
class problem by any stretch of the 
imagination. 
Since President Biden took office, we 
have watched every month as inflation 
has ravaged the country. What is this 
administration thinking? Is it so blind 
to the fact that families and hard-
working Americans are struggling to 
make ends meet? 
Mr. Speaker, the holiday season is on 
the horizon and Americans are more 
concerned than ever. With Thanks-
giving dinner and everyday commod-
ities becoming out of reach now, 
Christmas dinner will cost Americans 
an arm and a leg. This is downright 
shameful. 
f 
DECONGEST AMERICA’S PORTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to offer a solution to decongest Amer-
ica’s ports, revive America’s supply 
chain, and get Americans back to 
work. 
In the past few months, we have 
learned the hard way that congested 
ports create a real interstate com-
merce and supply chain problem. Fami-
lies are waiting 6 months for working 
refrigerators, farmers are waiting 2 
months or more for a simple part to fix 
their equipment, and manufacturing 
companies are waiting 5 to 6 times 
longer for electronic components. 
Well, people are tired of watching 
their paid-for, necessary goods sit on 
our ships off our coasts. The Biden ad-
ministration is not doing anything 
about it. 
Today, I introduced the Truckers Re-
sponding at National Shipping Ports 
Overcoming Retail Turmoil Act, re-
quiring the Secretary of Transpor-
tation to establish a grant program for 
motor carriers and motor private car-
riers to relieve congested ports during 
a national state of emergency or when 
ports are congested at 50 percent or 
more. 
My bill would empower the Secretary 
of Transportation to issue Federal 
grants from unused relief dollars to 
truckers or distributors to transport 
goods from a port of entry to a destina-
tion point.

Additionally, my bill would tempo-
rarily waive State-operating standards, 
should those standards be more strin-
gent than the Federal standard. For ex-
ample, my bill would allow Kansas 
farmers and truckers to operate their 
U.S. Department of Transportation 
compliant trucks in California, a State 
that otherwise restricts trucks older 
than 2011 from entering the State, to 
help relieve the ports and transport 
goods across this country. 
Temporarily waiving State require-
ments is a small price to pay for a 
strong supply chain, fully stocked 
shelves in grocery stores, and employed 
transportation workers. 
Congested ports have far-reaching 
implications beyond the States in 
which they exist, and it is unconscion-
able to let the American people suffer 
because of the unwillingness to solve a 
problem that impacts us all.

b 1045 
IRS OVERREACH 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to defend the American public from the 
worst sort of Federal Government over-
reach, that which involves their pri-
vate bank accounts. 
President Biden’s proposal to give 
the IRS unprecedented access to Amer-
icans’ bank accounts would pose hefty 
compliance 
burdens 
on 
community 
banks and credit unions, hamper the 
ability for individuals to access cap-
ital, and entrench the Federal Govern-
ment even further into our everyday 
lives, decaying freedom and eroding 
personal liberty. 
This is wrong for America, and I 
stand and will continue to stand in op-
position to this indefensible and waste-
ful proposal to invade the privacy of 
nearly every American. 
RECOGNIZING BRYCEN GULICK 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and thank Brycen Gulick 
for his service to me, my office, and 
Kansans throughout the Big First Dis-
trict. 
During his time in my office, Brycen 
has shown himself to be kind, creative, 
and joyful. I most admire his loyalty, 
always yearning to be a part of our 
team, and his adaptability and willing-
ness to step outside of his comfort 
zone. 
God continually puts open and closed 
doors in front of all of us, and the wise 
man asks God to speak and direct his 
steps as he walks through life. I am 
proud to have had Brycen on my team, 
and I pray that the Lord would help 
him blossom in his next adventure. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Brycen for his 
service. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL NATIVE 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of National Native 
American Heritage Month and to honor 
the 35th anniversary of the Nebraska 
Urban Indian Health Coalition, a pri-
vate nonprofit organization in Ne-
braska. 
The Nebraska Urban Indian Health 
Coalition 
provides 
community 
healthcare and services targeting the 
urban American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive population in the greater Omaha 
metropolitan area, Lincoln area, and 
Sioux City, Iowa, since 1986. Their re-
habilitative healthcare services and 
their diabetes self-management pro-
gram are nationally recognized. Cur-
rently, they are led by their CEO, Dr. 
Donna Polk. 
Donna Lee Mays was raised by her fa-
ther after her mother was hit and 
killed by a drunk driver on Christmas 
Day in 1949 at the age of 23. Dr. Polk 
was only 7 years old. Dr. Polk credits 
her grandmother, Annie Lee Mays, as 
one of her inspirations because of her 
spirituality and wisdom. 
Dr. Polk firmly believes in having vi-
sion and that you have to be able to see 
how things can be. If you don’t, Mr. 
Speaker, you don’t work to effect 
change. 
Between 1972 to 1985, Dr. Polk served 
as an affirmative action and equal op-
portunity officer at the State of Ne-
braska. She volunteered in the Ne-
braska corrections system for 26 years 
and starred in her own TV show called 
‘‘Frankly Female,’’ a show for and 
about women. 
Dr. Polk earned her bachelor’s degree 
in university studies, her master’s in 
counseling psychology, and a doctorate 
in 
administration, 
instruction, 
and 
curriculum, all from the University of 
Nebraska at Omaha. In addition, she is 
a published author. She wrote her 
book, ‘‘Black Men and Women of Ne-
braska,’’ in 1981 to shine the light on 
prominent African-American individ-
uals in our State. 
She joined the Urban Indian Health 
Coalition in 1991, running the coun-
seling program for women. She leads a 
team of over 40 employees that offer 
services such as inpatient and out-
patient substance abuse, transitional 
living, alcohol and drug recovery, 
healthcare services, and transportation 
to their facilities. Dr. Polk takes great 
pride in the community programs— 
Project Upstream, the Tired Moccasins 
Elders Program, and the Elder’s Pro-
gram—which help Native youth and 
families overcome socioeconomic dis-
parities and provide meals, educational 
opportunities, and even extracurricular 
activities for all ages. Dr. Polk is 
thrilled about the inauguration of their 
new headquarters scheduled to open in 
the spring of 2022. 
In recognizing the Nebraska Urban 
Indian Health Coalition, we shine a 
spotlight on 35 years of helping elevate 
the health status and disparities of 
urban Indians and other underserved 
populations in Nebraska and Iowa 
through education, collaboration, ad-
vocacy, and health service delivery. 
Congratulations to Dr. Polk and her 
team for 35 years of excellence and 
serving our great community. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS 
WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, this infra-
structure bill is about two things. This 
is about putting money in the pockets 
of the American people who have had a 
rough go for the last 40 years, and this 
is about taking on China. 
Now, we have seen in the last couple 
of weeks CEO pay since the 1970s has 
gone up 1,300 percent. We have seen 
that 10 percent of the wealthiest people 
in this country own 90 percent of the 
stocks. So this bill is about: How do we 
get money in the pockets of people? 
Universal preschool—that is 1 year 
less of childcare that a family has to 
pay—that is money in their pockets. 
Capping childcare at 7 percent of your 
income, Mr. Speaker, that is money in 
their pockets. Helping seniors with 
glasses or hearing aids, that is money 
in their pockets. A tax cut finally for 
working people, not for the top 1 per-
cent but for families, that is money in 
their pockets. 
If we don’t recognize in this Chamber 
and down the hall that China is a loom-
ing threat—not even looming, they are 
here. 
Semiconductors, 
they 
outmanufacture us; electric vehicles, 
they outmanufacture us; communica-
tions equipment, they outmanufacture 
us; pharmaceuticals, our seniors get 
their pharmaceuticals from China. 
When are we going to wake up? When 
are we going to have the guts to level 
the playing field and the guts to take 
on China and the guts to do what is 
right so our kids and grandkids can 
thrive in the United States? 
We have to make these investments. 
We have to make them now. Wash-
ington has to wake up, or the next bill 
we are going to have to pass is Man-
darin in all our schools because the 
game is going to be over.

HONORING DICK ANTOINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) for 5 min-

Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Dick 
Antoine, a wonderful man and beloved 
local radio personality in my home-
town of Hot Springs. 
Dick served in the U.S. Air Force 
during the Vietnam war, and in 2018, he 
retired from his daily talk radio pro-
gram, ‘‘Talk of the Town,’’ where he 
informed and entertained his faithful 
listeners for 31 years. 
Dick is not only known for his in-
sightful interviews and witty com-
mentary but also his leadership. A few 
of his many projects included the Vet-
erans Memorial of Garland County,

of Dick’s special characterization of 
Santa

many friends as we grieve his passing 
and celebrate his life. 
HONORING JIM GULDIN 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the work of a fel-
low Arkansan and Yale forester, Dr. 
James Guldin, or Jim as his friends 
call him. 
Jim taught at Arkansas’ only for-
estry school, the University of Arkan-
sas at Monticello, for 10 years before 
joining the United States Forest Serv-
ice research division, where he made 
great contributions to our knowledge 
of forest ecology and management 
through his applied research and publi-
cations over a career that spanned 
nearly three decades. 
Jim worked tirelessly to restore na-
tive southern pine ecosystems, illus-
trating how science-based thinning and 
prescribed burning are common sense, 
and to highlight effective tools for a 
healthy forest providing cleaner air 
and water as well as abundant wildlife 
habitat. 
I truly believe Dr. Jim Guldin is the 
world’s most knowledgeable person 
when it comes to shortleaf pine and 
that his work will live long past the 
lifespan of a human generation in the 
forests that benefited from his labor of 
love. 
I have been blessed to know some 
amazing conservationists in my life, 
and Jim Guldin is one of them. I wish 
him a happy retirement and many days 
ahead catching smallmouth bass in 
clear mountain streams and spending 
time where all fosterers are most at 
home: in the woods.

CONGRATULATING BESS BUTLER 
BRUNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Bess 
Brunson for being named to Georgia 
Trend’s 2021 40 Under 40 class. 
Driven by her passion to improve the 
financial health of others, Bess re-
ceived her undergraduate degree in 
business from Virginia Tech. Since re-
turning to Savannah, she has success-
fully served her community through 
various positions at The Fiduciary 
Group. 
Beth is the third generation of the 
Butler family to work at The Fiduciary 
Group, which was founded in 1970 by 
her grandfather, Lee Butler. Dedicated 
to serving others, Bess works tirelessly 
to prepare individuals for their life be-
yond retirement. 
Outside of the workplace, Bess is an 
active volunteer throughout the First 
District. She serves on the board of the 
Historic Savannah Foundation’s 13th 
Colony and Savannah Country Day 
School alumni board. Her dedication to 
preserving Savannah’s history while 
continuing the legacy of The Fiduciary 
Group is truly inspiring. 
I am honored to recognize Bess for 
this prestigious accomplishment, and I 
know she will continue to make a posi-
tive impact throughout Georgia’s First 
Congressional District. 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING CHARLIE 
WALDROP 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor one of my phar-
macy mentors, Charlie Waldrop of Sa-
vannah, Georgia, who sadly passed 
away on October 20 at the age of 102. 
A devoted public servant, Charlie was 
a World War II veteran, a pharmacist, 
and a friend to all who knew him. 
Charlie was drafted into World War II 
at the age of 22. He would go on to 
serve throughout Europe, successfully 
attaining the rank of major before fin-
ishing his military service in 1946. 
Discovering his passion for public 
health, Charlie continued his education 
at the University of Georgia’s College 
of Pharmacy. Charlie then returned to 
Savannah, where he would serve his 
community for the next 40 years as a 
pharmacist at Crumbley’s Pharmacy. 
Charlie’s life was defined by his ex-
traordinary character, and I am grate-
ful for his lifetime of service to Geor-
gia’s First District and our great Na-
tion. I am also thankful for the great 
example he set for me when I was a 
pharmacy intern working under Char-
lie. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
his family, friends, and all who knew 
him during this most difficult time. 
CONGRATULATING O.C. FOWLER, JR. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate O.C. 
Fowler, Jr., of Chatham County for 
being recognized as Veteran of the 
Year by the Veterans Council of Chat-
ham County. 
Georgia’s First Congressional Dis-
trict is home to many of our Nation’s 
veterans who put everything on the 
line to protect our freedom. So being 
recognized as Veteran of the Year is an 
incredible honor. 
Mr. Fowler joined the United States 
Navy in 1967 and flew over 3,300 flight 
hours in helicopters and fixed-wing air-
craft. After seeing how Vietnam vet-
erans were treated after they returned 
home, Mr. Fowler dedicated his life to 
ensure that our servicemembers are 
unconditionally supported. 
Among his many lifetime achieve-
ments, he helped raise over $35,000 for 
local charities, including the Chap-
lain’s Fund at Hunter Army Airfield. 
He is also an active member of the 
United States Service Organization, 
the National Museum of the Mighty 
Eighth Air Force, and the Savannah 
Council of the Navy League. 
I can’t thank Mr. Fowler enough for 
his outstanding service to our Nation, 
and I want to congratulate him again 
on this wonderful accomplishment. 
RECOGNIZING AND HONORING DEBORAH 
RODRIGUEZ GARCIA 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Deborah Rodriguez Garcia for being 
named to Georgia Trend’s 2021 40 Under 
40 class. 
Deborah 
graduated 
from 
Georgia 
Southern University with a master’s in 
modern 
language. 
This 
fueled 
her 
knowledge and incredible drive, which 
she is using to make a difference across 
the globe. 
Deborah creates educational opportu-
nities for migrant and refugee commu-
nities. She focuses on helping children 
become more resilient through play- 
based learning. Thanks to Deborah, ref-
ugee children in South Asia find com-
fort in early learning opportunities 
through a version of Sesame Street in 
their native clothing and language. 
Children in Latin America, South Afri-
ca, the Middle East, and Asia have ben-
efited immensely from her passion and 
experience. 
On behalf of the people of the First 
Congressional District of Georgia, I 
congratulate Deborah on her nomina-
tion to Georgia Trend’s 2021 40 under 40 
class and offer my appreciation for her 
continued service and dedication to-
ward children across the world.

PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER) for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, 
one of the top concerns for Americans 
is the high cost of prescription drugs. 
Congress must do something to lower 
these prescription drug prices. We 
know the American people want lower 
prices, but they don’t want to sacrifice 
access to lifesaving treatments. 
Prior to representing the great peo-
ple of east Tennessee in Congress, I 
served for 35 years as a community 
pharmacist, so I know a thing or two 
about safeguarding patient access to 
affordable medicines and solving pa-
tient problems. 
We absolutely need to reform the 
ways 
pharmaceutical 
manufacturers 
price their products and sometimes 
manipulate the system. But there is 
another part of the drug pricing equa-
tion that doesn’t get nearly as much 
attention, and that is the role of the 
pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, 
their lack of transparency, their mar-
ket dominance, and the effects of their 
business practices on drug prices and 
patient choices. 
PBMs were created as middlemen to 
reduce administrative costs for insur-
ers, validate patients’ eligibility, ad-
minister plan benefits, and negotiate

costs between pharmacies and health 
plans. But they have morphed into one 
of the most highly concentrated and 
least accountable profit centers in the 
healthcare industry. Over time, these 
PBMs have been allowed to operate and 
consolidate their market powers vir-
tually unchecked. 
Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial 
health plans all use PBMs to manage 
drug benefits. That is more than 260 
million American lives. 
b 1100 
These pharmacy benefit managers 
wield enormous power as middlemen on 
numerous fronts. They choose what 
drugs are covered and not covered by 
insurance; they negotiate purchasing 
deals with drug makers; they deter-
mine copays for consumers; they decide 
which pharmacies are included in pre-
scription plans and which are not; they 
decide how much pharmacies are reim-
bursed for the drugs they sell, where, 
by the way, a lot of pharmacies dis-
pense drugs to a patient, and they are 
reimbursed less than what they paid 
for the drug. 
In 2020, the top six PBMs handled 
more than 95 percent of total U.S.- 
equivalent prescription claims. Curi-
ously, this market power concentra-
tion and vertical integration with the 
insurance carriers was allowed by our 
Federal Trade Commission over the 
last 15 years, the very agency whose 
mission it is to safeguard Americans 
from concentrated corporate power. 
What are the effects on drug spend-
ing? Between 2015 and 2018, nearly half 
of the increase in total brand drug 
spending went to payers, including 
PBMs, according to an analysis from 
Berkeley Research Group. 
Such a huge slice of yearly drug 
spending going to middlemen has cata-
pulted the U.S. PBM market to be val-
ued at more than half a trillion dollars, 
and that is with a ‘‘T’’. Analysts see 
PBMs continuing to prosper in the 
coming years. 
The virtually unchecked powers of 
PBMs have enabled them to: Number 
one, charge drug manufacturers hefty 
rebates for preferred placement on 
formularies. The higher the list price, 
the higher the rebates, but no one 
knows where these rebates go. 
Number two is to impose restrictive 
take-it-or-leave-it contracts with com-
munity pharmacists. 
Number three is charge community 
pharmacies outrageous clawbacks or 
DIR fees, often totally unpredictable, 
where PBMs claw back or take back 
moneys they have already reimbursed 
pharmacies, often weeks or months 
after a patient transaction. The typical 
community pharmacy now pays rough-
ly $81,000 a year in DIR fees, making it 
all but impossible to set a budget for 
the future. 
These and other business practices 
happen in relative secrecy with no real 
oversight. No one is really able to fol-
low the dollars on how and where the 
money flows; not the payer, not the 
pharmacist, and certainly not the pa-
tient. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion, the PBM Accountability Study 
Act, H.R. 1829, which would have the 
U.S. Government Accountability Office 
study the roles PBMs play in drug pric-
ing and spending, their market con-
centrations, and states of competition. 
My bill also requires GAO to make rec-
ommendations on lowering drug costs, 
improving transparency, and improv-
ing competition in the PBM industry. 
This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, 
and I invite all of my colleagues to co-
sponsor and help with this important 
legislation. 
I sincerely hope we can work to-
gether to include the provisions of this 
bill and other PBM reforms in any 
drug-pricing legislation that we con-
sider this year.

CONGRATULATING MOHAWK VAL-
LEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON 
ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mohawk Valley 
Community College on its historic 75th 
anniversary this year. 
MVCC first opened its doors to stu-
dents in October of 1946. Back then it 
was known as New York State Insti-
tute of Applied Arts and Science. Since 
those early days, MVCC has grown tre-
mendously and today boasts more than 
6,000 full- or part-time students. MVCC 
was founded on the principle of adapt-
ing its programs to fit the needs of our 
region, and, boy, they have done that. 
It has played an important role in de-
veloping our workforce and empow-
ering students to achieve their goals 
and be of service to our community. 
MVCC molds students into leaders 
and continues to be an incredible insti-
tution for our community. It is one of 
the great 11 colleges and universities in 
New York’s 22nd District. 
I want to personally thank President 
Randy VanWagoner for his leadership 
and wish MVCC the greatest successes 
over the next 75 years. 
I am grateful to MVCC for all they 
have done, and for being a college near 
my neighborhood. 
CONGRATULATING CANASTOTA GIRLS FIELD 
HOCKEY TEAM 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to recognize the Canastota Girls 
Field Hockey team, for becoming the 
New York State section III class C 
champions after a win this weekend. 
Way to go girls. 
The Canastota Raiders prevailed 3 to 
1 against Vernon-Verona-Sherrill in a 
dramatic battle for the class C cham-
pionship. 
Chance Jaquin, Kory Matteson, and 
MacKenzie Snyder all scored goals for 
the Raiders, sealing the victory. The 
Raiders have now won 11 straight 
games and will face off against Little 
Falls for the State playoffs this week. 
I am wishing them all the best as 
they prepare for the championship 
game this week. I also want to con-
gratulate Vernon-Verona-Sherrill on 
what I know was a hard-fought season. 
I wish the best of luck to the girls. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJEEDAH RAZZAQ 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
recognize a Binghamton woman who 
was a larger than life, a fixture at com-
munity events, a staple in the very 
communities that needed her most, and 
the adopted grandma of kids who 
looked up to her for advice through 
adolescence and well into adulthood. 
As a life skills coach, Majeedah 
Razzaq used her own mix of street psy-
chology with a strong dose of rule en-
forcement, consistency, and most of 
all, accountability. In her work with 
Greater Opportunities for Broome, Ms. 
Razzaq was a fighter for local issues, 
someone who encouraged and worked 
for new investments in local commu-
nities, investments in the children who 
needed it most. 
As a staple at the city of Bingham-
ton’s Community Development Advi-
sory Committee, Ms. Razzaq had a 
unique ability to sort through the fluff, 
then address the real issues. Ms. 
Razzaq lived an amazing life which, un-
fortunately, was cut short this past 
winter by COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please join me and the citizens of 
Broome County, New York, in remem-
bering and honoring Majeedah Razzaq 
for her years of community service. 
Binghamton and the Southern Tier 
were lucky to have such a beautiful 
person advocating on their behalf. 
May God bless her soul.

Living God, our souls thirst for You. 
In this dry and weary land, we look 
around for something that can sustain 
us in these times of complexity and 
frustration, 
something 
that 
will 
quench our thirst for righteousness and 
goodwill. But everything we reach for 
is a mirage. 
In this wilderness, we pray that You 
would remember us, call us, we who are 
so thirsty, to come to the water that 
You so generously offer to slake our

spiritual drought. Our souls are hungry

provided to Your people so long ago, 
may the words that come from Your 
mouth feed us in a way that mere 
bread cannot. 
Open our eyes to the nourishment we

Holy God, You have made us an ever-
lasting covenant. All that You set be-

We lift up these prayers by the

LUNG CANCER AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
November as Lung Cancer Awareness 
Month. 
Despite many advances in cancer di-
agnosis, care, and treatment, lung can-
cer remains the leading cause of cancer 
deaths in America today. Screening is 
key to detecting lung cancer early and 
can significantly improve survival out-
comes. But fewer than five percent of 
all eligible Americans undergo screen-
ing for lung cancer each year. 
It is vital that we encourage all those 
who are eligible to get screened and en-
sure that receiving screening is as easy 
as possible. By improving access to 
screening, we can catch lung cancer 
early and give patients the best pos-
sible hope for beating this terrible dis-
ease. 
f 
PENNSYLVANIA’S NATURAL GAS 
INDUSTRY 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, North-
east Pennsylvania is home to a world- 
class energy industry that is creating 
prosperity and opportunities for our 
students, families, and economy. It is 
one of those things that you must see 
to believe. 
That is why I recently hosted my col-
leagues from the Western Caucus, Rep-
resentatives 
YVETTE
HERRELL
and 
Chairman DAN NEWHOUSE, to see first-
hand the widespread benefits of Penn-
sylvania’s natural gas industry. 
We saw how students are being pre-
pared for good-paying energy jobs at 
the Lackawanna College’s School of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas and the 
Susquehanna County Career and Tech-
nology Center. We experienced the 
sheer volume of natural gas production 
at an active drilling site, the Williams’ 
Potter Compressor Station and Coterra 
Energy’s natural gas wells. 
To put Pennsylvania’s energy domi-
nance into perspective, one well in Sus-
quehanna County produces as much 
natural gas as 4,000 wells in West Vir-
ginia. This energy means national se-
curity, a stronger workforce, and lower 
energy costs. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my col-
leagues for taking time to see the great 
work happening in Pennsylvania. We 
must protect it. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, we have been 
working hard on a transformative bill 
that will make a difference in so many 
people’s lives, the Build Back Better 
Act. And yet, the Democrats who are 
behind this bill, who have worked on it 
so hard, have been under a barrage of 
attack and criticism for being in dis-
array, for being unable to get it done. 
But let me say this: This is how it 
should be done. We are talking about 
historic unprecedented investments in 
our climate, in universal pre-K, in drug 
pricing, in housing policy. Why would 
anyone think that that is a bill that 
should come together quickly? 
This is the legislative process. We 
craft. We read. We edit. We make 
changes. We read it again—all for the 
good of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, we will get this done 
and it will be a solid, well-thought-out, 
beautiful piece of legislation. It will 
make a real difference in people’s lives. 
Keep the faith. 
f 
SUPPLY CHAIN BACKLOGS 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the rising costs and 
supply chain backlogs that are impact-
ing hardworking families. 
Store shelves across the country are 
empty. Families are facing what is ex-
pected 
to 
be 
the 
most 
expensive 
Thanksgiving in history. 
Yet, we have heard silence from Con-
gressional Democrats on these issues. 
We need to solve these bigger supply 
chain issues, not double down on fail-
ing economic policies that have made 
life for American businesses and work-
ers harder and more expensive. 
Thanks to record inflation levels, 
households earning the median income 
have been forced to spend an additional 
$175 per month on food, fuel, and hous-
ing. These higher costs are making 
your paychecks worth less. 
Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight 
against these policies that are making 
life for Americans more expensive. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, Congress 
is close to delivering the Build Back 
Better Act this week containing our 
most comprehensive social provisions 
ever. 
Build Back Better will afford a pleth-
ora of gains our country has long 
sought—from our first significant ac-
tion on climate change to urgently ad-
dressing the 100,000 teacher shortage as 
our children are returning to school. 
Congress is in the end zone on this 
bill now, although many of us are still 
trying to get prescription drug prices 
done. And Congress is paying for Build 
Back Better without adding to the def-
icit—unlike the last administration 
that gave tax breaks to those least in 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, we will make history 
with passage of Build Back Better. 
f 
ECONOMIC CRISIS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, time and 
again I come to the House floor to 
highlight the out-of-control spending 
schemes of the House majority. But 
sadly, this falls on deaf ears as they 
continue their efforts to push leftist 
government-dependency bills through 
this Chamber. 
When will the majority leader realize 
that there is a real-world impact to 
their fiscal irresponsibility? 
Just this past quarter, the U.S. Gross 
Domestic Product slowed to a dis-
appointing 2 percent, and real dispos-
able income decreased 5.6 percent, that 
is after already having decreased 30.2 
percent in the second quarter. 
On top of all this, inflation has in-
creased every month since Joe Biden 
was sworn in and prices are at a 13-year 
high. Gas alone is now averaging $3.39 a 
gallon—a 7-year high. With prices ris-
ing across the board, the average fam-
ily is spending $175 dollars more a 
month on food, fuel, and housing in 
Biden’s America. That is more than 
$2,000 a year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6082 
November 2, 2021 
Job growth has slowed dramatically, 
and the September jobs report fell 
300,000 jobs short of what economists 
are predicting. This is in addition to 
massive shortages that have wrought 
havoc on our supply chain and left a 
record number of container ships wait-
ing to enter our ports. 
f 
BUILDING BACK BETTER 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, three of the 
goals of President Biden’s agenda and 
that of Congressional Democrats are to 
recover from this pandemic, to create 
jobs, and to lower taxes. We have met 
all three. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, 
case rates and hospitalizations from 
COVID are dropping across our coun-
try, 
unemployment 
rolls 
have 
de-
creased, and since January 20, approxi-
mately 5 million jobs have been cre-
ated. 
In addition, Democrats delivered a 
tax cut for families with children. We 
greatly expanded this tax cut, and we 
sent payments on a recurring monthly 
basis to American families. By the 
middle of this month, in November, the 
overall majority of families with chil-
dren will get another round of pay-
ments directly deposited into their 
bank accounts. 
The Joint Economic Committee has 
shown that this creates $19 billion 
worth of economic activity in the local 
jurisdictions and when you let Amer-
ican families keep their hard-earned 
money, it creates economic growth. We 
will try to extend this tax cut for 
working families in the Build Back 
Better Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans to 
join us. 
f 
SEPTEMBER BORDER NUMBERS 
ARE ALARMING 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to ask where is the administra-
tion? It is certainly not at our south-
ern border. The crisis at the border 
continues to go unaddressed. 
In September, more than 192,000 ille-
gal immigrants were apprehended by 
our Border Patrol agents. That is a 233 
percent increase over last September, 
and DHS has warned this month we 
could see as many as 400,000. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask: Where are my 
Democrat colleagues on this crisis? 
Under the leadership of the other side 
of the aisle, this House has not consid-
ered a single piece of meaningful legis-
lation to address the issue. The strat-
egy appears to be pretend as if the 
problem doesn’t exist. Meanwhile, a 
record 1.2 million people have been 
caught trying to cross the border ille-
gally this year. Imagine how many 
tens of thousands have evaded cap-
ture—who might be dangerous to our 
local communities—and made it into 
this country. 
Rather than solving this crisis, this 
body is instead considering legislation 
that will pave the way for mass am-
nesty. It is irresponsible. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
step up, come to the table, hold real bi-
partisan discussions and focus on this 
crisis. 
f 
HONORING JOVITA MOORE 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Jovita Moore, an 
award-winning journalist whose pres-
ence and professionalism were known 
across newsrooms around Georgia and 
throughout the country. 
I, and so many whose lives she 
touched every single day, are deeply 
saddened by her passing. Her life was a 
positive force for good in this world. 
Every evening, little girls saw them-
selves on the television knowing that 
one day they could be the woman their 
community trusted at the end of each 
day. 
So while we mourn her death and suf-
fer our heartbreak, I want to take this 
time to celebrate the life of a woman 
who always stood steadfast and reso-
lute, who was classy and consistent in 
presenting us the facts and the news of 
the moment. 
This week, our hearts are with 
Jovita’s family and her children, and 
my prayers are with the WSB team. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESS 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, nearly every 
Member of this body proclaims to be a 
champion of small business. But how 
many follow with action? 
Time after time my colleagues are 
presented with opportunities to vote in 
support of small businesses and then 
repeatedly fail to live up to their hol-
low promises. 
They say they support small busi-
nesses, but Democrats proudly support 
increases on small businesses and job 
creators. 
They are actively disrupting the 
labor market by keeping workers out 
of the workforce with never-ending 
handouts to able-bodied Americans. 
They are preventing first-generation 
entrepreneurs from passing a success-
ful business on to the next generation. 
They 
are 
expanding 
credits 
for 
childcare without any work require-
ments for the parents. 
They are surveilling small businesses 
and farmers through the IRS. 
The Democrat dream is an America 
dependent 
on 
Big 
Government. 
It 
couldn’t be farther from the American 
Dream where a guy like me, who grew 
up on food stamps, could take a big 
idea and a big work ethic and turn it 
into a successful business career and 
job creator. 
Under Democrat policies, we may see 
the end of the American Dream. We 
cannot let that happen.

BUILD BACK BETTER FOR 
PENNSYLVANIA 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, our negotia-
tions have been long, but today we are 
closer than ever to passing Build Back 
Better. We have heard enough about 
the process. Let’s talk about the im-
pact, the transformative investments 
we are making in our children, our sen-
iors, and our planet. 
And let me say this loudly and clear-
ly: It is paid for; paid for with the taxes 
ensuring that corporations and the 
mega-rich pay their fair share, and IRS 
investments closing the multi-trillion 
dollar tax gap. 
Paid-for, historic investments in our 
future: In Pennsylvania alone, more 
than 200,000 children will have access 
to high-quality pre-K, and more than 
730,000 children will gain access to 
childcare. 
Childcare and extended child tax 
credits will ease the financial burdens 
that our parents face. They are not the 
only ones, 122,000 uninsured Pennsylva-
nians will have healthcare. Bold cli-
mate action will help our districts that 
have seen an increase in climate disas-
ters. 
My Commonwealth is ready for both 
Build Back Better and the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. The process will be 
forgotten, the investments will not. 
f 
HIGHER HEATING BILLS 
(Mr. BOST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, the average 
cost of a gallon of gas in my hometown 
of Murphysboro, Illinois, is $3.60 and 
rising. That is not all. Tonight’s tem-
peratures will dip down to about 29 de-
grees in southern Illinois and families 
will be dialing up the thermostat. 
Many of my constituents rely on pro-
pane to heat their homes during these 
colder months. According to the En-
ergy Information Administration, mid-
western families that use propane this 
winter can expect to pay as much as 54 
percent more in their heating bills; po-
tentially an additional $1,800 this win-
ter. 
Southern Illinois and southern Illi-
noisans are feeling that crunch. Yet, 
many of my Democrat colleagues only 
care

natural gas. As winter approaches, we 
can’t allow them to leave our families 
out in the cold. 
f 
BIDEN OUTRAGEOUS GAS PRICES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, 
Americans 
see 
firsthand 
Biden inflation at every turn and no-
where more than gas costs. The Biden 
failed policies are obvious at every gas 
station with prices up $1.50 per gallon 
over last year, an additional $20 per 
fill-up. 
The 
$3.5 
trillion 
Biden 
inflation 
spending bill would make it more ex-
pensive to heat homes, drive cars, oper-
ate trucks, and keep the lights on. The 
Biden tax increase on natural gas alone 
would raise heating bills and destroy 
90,000 jobs. 
The Energy Information Administra-
tion forecasts home heating costs this 
winter: Propane up 54 percent, heating 
oil up 43 percent, natural gas up 30 per-
cent. The Democrat elite think they 
are smarter than anyone, and they be-
lieve Democrat voters are ignorant to 
believe that $3.5 trillion in spending 
costs zero. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
which now continues, sadly, from Af-
ghanistan to America, as Biden ignored 
military advice, leading to 13 murdered 
marines.

RECOGNIZING COLE BAERLOCHER, 
NATIONAL FFA PRESIDENT 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise to congratulate the newly-elected 
national 
FFA 
president, 
Cole 
Baerlocher, who hails from the great 
State of Washington. Cole, a native of 
Colfax, is now honored with this tre-
mendous opportunity to represent our 
State and our entire Nation. 
For more than 90 years, FFA has pro-
vided students with premier leadership 
training 
through 
agricultural 
edu-
cation and advocacy. As a former FFA 
member myself, I can attest that my 
experience not only helped shape my 
career as a farmer, but helped prepare 
me to represent the Fourth District of 
Washington in Congress. 
Throughout his year of service to 
FFA, Cole and his fellow national offi-
cers will lead workshops and con-
ferences across the country, cultivate 
relationships with national agriculture 
leaders, and help set policies that will 
guide the future of FFA. 
Cole: Washington’s entire agricul-
tural community is proud to have you 
representing us, and we look forward to 
following your journey on behalf our 
Nation’s producers. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to please join me in con-
gratulating our national FFA officers. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MALLORY WHITE 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate 
my 
friend 
and 
con-
stituent, Mallory White, of Union 
County, Kentucky, on her recent elec-
tion as a national FFA officer. 
Mallory is coming off a term as Ken-
tucky State FFA president, a position 
I was honored to hold back in the day. 
In this role, Mallory put her leadership 
skills to good use in serving as an out-
standing ambassador for Union County 
and Kentucky agriculture. 
But never one to stop climbing the 
ladder of success, Mallory didn’t stop 
there. In successfully seeking a na-
tional 
FFA 
office, 
Mallory 
dem-
onstrated that she has all the qualities 
to be a successful leader for years to 
come. 
With this impressive achievement, 
Mallory personified the positive dif-
ference that FFA makes in young peo-
ple’s lives. This extraordinary achieve-
ment makes Union County and the en-
tire First Congressional District of 
Kentucky proud. 
Mr. Speaker, I am eager to see what 
Mallory White accomplishes in the 
years to come. 
f 
HONORING OUR BRAVE VETERANS 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, as we 
celebrate our veterans next week, I rise 
to honor the dedication and selfless-
ness of the brave men and women who 
have served our Nation. 
California’s 21st Congressional Dis-
trict is home to thousands of veterans 
who are especially valued members of 
our community. Our veterans have 
made incredible sacrifices to the cause 
of freedom, and America is forever in 
their debt. 
As Members of Congress, we have the 
responsibility to ensure our veterans 
receive the benefits they are entitled. 
Those who have courageously served 
our country deserve our support, and 
we must protect their care. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in thanking our veterans for 
their service to our country in honor of 
this Veterans Day. It is a privilege to 
represent these men and women in 
Congress. 
f 
OPPOSING DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE VACCINE MANDATE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the Department 
of Defense’s vaccine mandate. 
My district is home to the Sierra 
Army Depot in Lassen County, which 
uses a large contingent of civilian mili-
tary contractors. Sierra Army Depot 
repairs equipment, salvages old tanks 
and armored carriers for platforms 
that are still serviceable. 
Over the past year, the depot has 
served as the Army’s global storage 
and distribution center for COVID–19 
testing kits and personal protective 
equipment. As a Nation, we leaned on 
the Sierra Army Depot, and other simi-
lar ones around the country, to protect 
our servicemembers while they were 
busy protecting us. They put it on the 
line during the worst of the pandemic 
and didn’t question it. 
Now, the Biden administration is 
planning to fire hundreds of these con-
tractors because they have not made 
the personal choice to be vaccinated 
with emergency-use vaccines, two of 
which are still under emergency-use 
authorization. 
After a year, putting the weight of 
the Army on this workforce, asking 
them to work overtime and get the job 
done, and take the risks we did not 
know about a year and a half ago, the 
President is going to fire them? Is that 
really the kind of message we want to 
send to our military? 
f 
REMEMBERING MARTHA BREENE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember 
the life and legacy of Martha Breene, a 
staple figure in Pennsylvania Repub-
lican politics. 
Martha has been involved in politics 
since the 1960s. She was a phenomenal 
grassroots organizer, where she worked 
tirelessly on both local and national 
campaigns. 
Martha did what she did because she 
loves this Nation and the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. She worked so 
hard to see that people are better 
served, and she did that through poli-
tics. 
In 2004, she was the first women 
elected to serve as the Venango County 
Republican chairman. She retired in 
2013, only to return to that role in 2017 
where she served up until her passing 
this year. 
I had the privilege of working with 
Martha and her late husband, Charlie, 
during my first election starting in 
2008. Martha has always had the ability 
to motivate, and it is that quality that 
made her an exceptional leader. She 
was a force to be reckoned with and 
will be deeply missed in Venango Coun-
ty. 
Mr. Speaker, my deepest condolences 
go to Martha’s family and friends dur-
ing this time.

November 2, 2021 
NATURAL GAS TAX 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to announce the introduction of 
my bill opposing the latest attack on 
American energy producers. 
Crisis after crisis after crisis, and yet 
Democrats are pushing a natural gas 
tax that will reduce our GDP by $9 bil-
lion, kill at least 90,000 jobs, and raise 
energy bills for every American. 
In fact, every American family will 
pay nearly 20 percent more on their 
utility bills almost immediately. Presi-
dent Biden’s out-of-control spending is 
already driving prices up on every-
thing. We know that this is going to be 
the most expensive Thanksgiving in 
history. And now Democrats are des-
perately searching for new ways to 
squeeze even more money out of the 
American people to pay for Big Govern-
ment projects. 
A natural gas tax is a tax on every 
single American, and it will dispropor-
tionately hurt working-class Ameri-
cans, farmers, and ranchers. President 
Biden’s message in Europe is, Amer-
ican 
energy—never. 
Our 
message 
should be American-made energy is 
better than ever. 
f 
HONORING VETERAN PASTOR 
GERALD MCGINNIS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor Pastor Gerald McGinnis as 
Tennessee’s Second District Veteran of 
the Month. 
Pastor McGinnis, a very dear friend 
of mine, served our country as a spe-
cialist in the United States Army dur-
ing the Vietnam war. In 1968, his com-
pound was attacked by approximately 
1,500 North Vietnamese Army soldiers 
in the middle of the night. Despite the 
intense enemy fire, he fought off the 
North Vietnamese in defense of the 
three wounded American soldiers shel-
tering in his bunker. 
Relentlessly defending that bunker 
saved Pastor McGinnis’ life and all the 
lives of his fellow servicemembers. He 
was successful against all odds. Nearly 
40 years later, he was awarded the 
Bronze Star for his heroism. Last 
week, Pastor McGinnis was upgraded 
to the Silver Star in further recogni-
tion of his bravery. 
Following his military service, Pas-
tor McGinnis worked as a sheet metal 
worker for several years. He later de-
cided that serving the Lord was his 
true calling and began studying the-
ology. In 1980, he founded Park West 
Church of God in Knoxville, where he 
continues to serve. 
Under Pastor McGinnis’ leadership, 
the church has grown to serve a mem-
bership of over 2,000 Christians. He also 
served as chaplain of the Knoxville- 
based divisions of the FBI and ATF, as 
well as the Knox County Sheriff’s De-
partment. 
Pastor McGinnis serves his fellow 
veterans every chance he gets. A few 
years ago, he started raising funds to 
purchase a farm where veterans could 
go to receive counseling and study the 
Bible to help cope with their PTSD. 
Thank you, Gerald, for your service 
to our country, your fellow veterans, 
and the Lord. I would say on a personal 
note, I was at the service and my dear 
friend, Jenny Stansberry in my home 
office, helped him get that Silver Star. 
All he talked about was his buddies 
that he left behind. He is a true hero, 
Mr. Speaker.

PARENTS’ FIRST AMENDMENT 
RIGHTS 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the Biden De-
partment of Justice attack on our par-
ents who advocate for their children to 
our local school boards. These efforts 
undermine the very foundation of our 
public schools. That is what they do. 
We have recently seen an unprece-
dented level of local civic engagement 
allowing parents, teachers, and govern-
ment officials to navigate our pan-
demic recovery and promote account-
ability in the classroom. However, this 
administration has responded by using 
scare tactics to prevent any criticism 
from parents against biased policies. 
Parents don’t want their children’s 
educational development stunted by 
mask mandates or corrupted by crit-
ical race theory. What parents do want 
is a say in their children’s educational 
futures without being threatened for 
exercising 
their 
First 
Amendment 
rights. 
The Attorney General must imme-
diately withdraw this memorandum. 
I will continue fighting for a mom’s 
or dad’s right to make their opinion 
heard because that is the America our 
parents and students deserve.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 3469, the Vet-
eran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 
2021. But before I begin, let me say how 
proud I am of the committee’s work on 
behalf of small businesses. I am pleased 
that we have worked together on these 
bills that we are taking up today be-
cause small businesses deserve nothing 
less. 
I would also like to thank Ranking 
Member LUETKEMEYER for his bipar-
tisan leadership on our effort today 
and the work of our Small Business 
Committee members who continuously 
strive to make critical changes in pol-
icy for entrepreneurs. 
This 
week 
is 
National 
Veterans 
Small Business Week, and I would like 
to take a moment to honor and salute 
the contributions veterans have made 
to American small businesses and in 
our country. 
The Veteran Entrepreneurship Train-
ing Act of 2021 is timely because it 
would make vital improvements to 
SBA’s Boots to Business Program, as 
well as offer certainty to transitioning 
servicemembers by authorizing the 
program for 5 years. 
Since its inception in 2011, SBA’s 
Boots to Business Program has been a 
vital resource for transitioning service-
members and their spouses looking to 
launch and grow their small busi-
nesses. 
Boots to Business offers a 2-day, in- 
person entrepreneurial education and 
training program as part of the Depart-
ment of Defense’s Transition Assist-
ance Program. This valuable program 
is delivered throughout the country by 
Veterans Business Outreach Centers. 
Each year, more than 200,000 service-
members make the transition from 
military to civilian life, and transition 
assistance is a critical component to 
ensure that our veterans have mean-
ingful employment opportunities. 
Veterans are uniquely positioned to 
succeed in starting and growing their 
own small businesses. The leadership 
skills, organizational abilities, and te-
nacity they developed through their 
time in the military lend themselves 
perfectly to the rigors of entrepreneur-
ship. According to the SBA, veterans 
are 45 percent more likely to be self- 
employed than nonveterans, with 1 in 
10 veterans owning a small business 
and, in return, employing 5.8 million 
individuals. 
I want to thank Mr. SCHNEIDER and 
Mr. WILLIAMS for their work to provide 
meaningful 
entrepreneurship 
assist-
ance to veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3469, 
the 
Veteran 
Entrepreneurship 
Training Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, this week is National 
Veterans Small Business Week. This is 
a time to honor and recognize the men 
and women who have served our Nation 
proudly in uniform. Many of these 
brave veterans go on to start and run 
successful businesses. This week and 
every week, we must recognize their 
resiliency and determination. 
I would like to thank all our veterans 
who have dedicated their lives to keep-
ing the United States safe and pre-
serving our freedoms. 
Importantly, today we are consid-
ering the Veteran Entrepreneurship 
Training Act of 2021, which codifies the 
Small Business Administration’s suc-
cessful Boots to Business Program. The 
Boots to Business Program offers vet-
erans, servicemembers, and military

their skills in the military. 
I am proud that we are focusing on 
veteran-owned businesses, and I believe 
this legislation will continue to pro-
vide important and valuable resources 
as our veterans return home and tran-
sition into providing goods and services 
to their communities. 
I would like to thank Mr. SCHNEIDER 
from Illinois and Mr. WILLIAMS from 
Texas, who is the vice ranking member 
of our committee, for working dili-
gently on this legislation. I would also 
like to thank the chair for her efforts 
on this legislation and for working 
with me in a bipartisan manner to ad-
vance all the commonsense small busi-
ness bills before us today. I look for-
ward to working with the chairwoman 
on several issues moving forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3469, which was 
passed favorably out of our committee 
via voice vote, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the chairwoman and the 
ranking member for helping bring this 
bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we mark 
Veterans Small Business Week in sup-
port of the Veteran Entrepreneurship 
Training Act of 2021, an important bi-
partisan bill I was proud to introduce 
with Congressman ROGER WILLIAMS to 
help build our economy by giving vet-
erans the tools they need to success-
fully start and grow their own busi-
nesses. 
Just as our Nation’s security rests on 
the shoulders of the men and women 
serving in our armed services, our Na-
tion’s economic growth relies on small 
businesses and American entrepreneur-
ship. U.S. small businesses generate 44 
percent of our total economic output 
annually; they employ almost half of 
all 
working 
Americans; 
and 
they 
produce almost 65 percent of all new 
jobs. 
Small business owners exemplify the 
American Dream. According to the 
SBA, self-employed people, on average, 
earn more and have more net worth 
than the non-self-employed. Perhaps 
best of all, Mr. Speaker, owning your 
own business is the chance to do some-
thing you love and to control your own 
destiny. 
We also know that many veterans 
have the self-motivation, experience, 
and valuable acquired skills to be suc-
cessful entrepreneurs and small busi-
ness owners. America’s veterans have 
gained extraordinary experience and 
learned vital lessons, including plan-
ning, leadership, team building, prob-
lem-solving, 
and 
adapting 
to 
con-
stantly changing situations. 
The Boots to Business Program offers 
veterans a training curriculum to help 
them transfer their service experiences 
to the business world and expand their 
skill set with the know-how to succeed 
and prosper. 
Since being launched in 2011, more 
than 50,000 veterans and their spouses 
have benefited from the Boots to Busi-
ness 
Program, 
learning 
everything 
from strategic planning, marketing, 
basic accounting, and even financing 
for a new business or new opportunity. 
As we beat back the pandemic, one of 
the best things we can do to help re-
build our economy is to unleash the in-
genuity and entrepreneurship that can 
power our Nation into the post-COVID, 
21st century global economy. The bi-
partisan bill before the House today 
builds on proven outcomes by formally 
codifying the Boots to Business Pro-
gram into law. 
I want to thank all of our veterans. I 
am pleased that this bill passed out of 
the committee with strong bipartisan 
support, and I am happy we are bring-
ing it to the House floor today for a 
vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the Veteran Entre-
preneurship Training Act of 2021. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WIL-
LIAMS), who is the vice ranking mem-
ber of the committee. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank our ranking member and 
our chairwoman for their leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Veteran Entrepreneur-
ship Training Act of 2021, which equips 
transitioning servicemembers with re-
sources to become entrepreneurs. 
In Congress, it is my greatest privi-
lege to represent our military service-
members and veterans in the 25th Dis-
trict of Texas, and I am honored to 
fight on their behalf in Washington. 
I am proud to have led this bipar-
tisan bill with my Democratic col-
league and my friend, Mr. SCHNEIDER. 
Our bill codifies the Boots to Business 
Program for 5 years. 
The Boots to Business Program is a 
2-day, in-person entrepreneurship pro-
gram offered by the Small Business Ad-
ministration 
that 
provides 
transitioning servicemembers and mili-
tary spouses information about busi-
ness ownership and self-employment. 
While serving in the military, our 
servicemembers learned how to make 
sound decisions in chaotic environ-
ments. Research has shown that serv-
icemembers’ unique skill sets prepare 
them to own and operate their own 
business. 
Every year more than 200,000 service-
members make the transition from 
military to civilian life, and it is crit-
ical that we assist their transition and 
provide them with the tools they need 
to be successful in whatever they en-
deavor next. 
This 
week 
is 
National 
Veterans 
Small Business Week, making it the 
perfect time for Congress to pass this 
bill and empower our veteran entre-
preneurs. It is our duty and responsi-
bility to ensure the men and women 
who have defended our liberty and free-
dom are given the tools to launch a 
successful business career after their 
military service concludes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle—this is biparti-
sanship—to support this bill to con-
tinue this crucial program that helps 
our veterans become the next genera-
tion of business leaders. 
In God We Trust. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
The Boots to Business Program is 
critical in assisting our veterans dur-
ing their entrepreneurial business jour-
ney. I, once again, want to thank all of 
our friends and colleagues along the 
way here for their help putting this bill 
together, as well as our brave men and 
women who have served in the military 
on our behalf of our great country. We 
are better off with their unwavering 
commitment to American safety and 
security. 
Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate and 
honor National Veterans Small Busi-
ness Week, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 3469, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s veterans, and 
their families, deserve our support as 
they transition back to civilian life. 
SBA’s Boots to Business Program is a 
critical part of that support for vet-
erans looking to begin their next chap-
ter through entrepreneurship. 
I am pleased to support this legisla-
tion, which will go a long way in ensur-
ing transitioning servicemembers suc-
cess in civilian life once their tours of 
duty are complete. 
In light of National Veterans Small 
Business Week and Veterans Day next 
week, there is no better time for Con-
gress to show their support for veteran 
entrepreneurs. I thank my colleagues, 
Mr. BRAD SCHNEIDER from Illinois and 
Mr. ROGER WILLIAMS from Texas, for 
working together in support of Amer-
ica’s veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 3469, which will provide statu-
tory authority for the ‘‘Boots to Business’’ pro-
gram, which provides entrepreneurship train-
ing to individuals, such as veterans and active 
service members, to be administered by the 
Small Business Administration. 
I want to first thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative SCHNEIDER, for introducing this leg-
islation that will help veterans who served our 
country with honor and bravery, transition from 
military to civilian life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6087 
November 2, 2021 
Administered through the Office of Veteran 
Business Development in the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), the B2B program offers 
transitioning service members and military 
spouses a foundational two-day, in-person 
course for an introduction to business owner-
ship which can be followed by optional online 
courses on topics including market research, 
business fundamentals, and revenue readi-
ness. 
Since B2B launched in 2013, more than 
50,000 service members and spouses have 
participated in the program. 
The Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act 
of 2021 would authorize this program for five 
years. 
Honorable Americans who serve this nation 
deserve to be equipped with the training, ex-
pertise, and tools they need to make a suc-
cessful career transition from the Armed Serv-
ices. 
This program offers critical courses that pro-
vide deep insight into starting and running a 
business and can make the difference for so 
many of our brave service men and women. 
It is important that our heroic veterans con-
tinue to have the opportunity to participate in 
the ‘‘Boots to Business’’ program and pursue 
their business and entrepreneurial goals. 
The U.S. Census shows that 5.7 million indi-
viduals are employed by a recorded 2 million 
veteran-owned businesses. 
Veterans are 45 percent more likely to be 
self-employed than those who have no military 
background. 
Many of the leadership, problem solving, 
and communications skills learned in the 
armed forces translate to entrepreneurial and 
business success, and the ‘‘Boots to Busi-
ness’’ program does immeasurably important 
work helping veterans start and grow busi-
nesses. 
Our veterans deserve the upmost respect, 
and part of this is giving them the tools they 
need to succeed. 
I am proud to support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3469. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

b 1245 
INVESTING IN MAIN STREET ACT 
OF 2021 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4256) to amend the Small 
Business Investment Act of 1958 to in-
crease the amount that certain banks 
and savings associations may invest in 
small business investment companies, 
subject to the approval of the appro-
priate Federal banking agency, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4256 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in 
Main Street Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESS IN-
VESTMENT COMPANIES. 
Section 302(b) of the Small Business In-
vestment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682(b)) is 
amended— 
(1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the 
period the following: ‘‘or, subject to the ap-
proval of the appropriate Federal banking 
agency, 15 percent of such capital and sur-
plus’’; 
(2) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the 
period the following: ‘‘or, subject to the ap-
proval of the appropriate Federal banking 
agency, 15 percent of such capital and sur-
plus’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(3) APPROPRIATE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCY 
DEFINED.—For purposes of this subsection, 
the term ‘appropriate Federal banking agen-
cy’ has the meaning given that term under 
section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act.’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 4256, the In-
vesting in Main Street Act of 2021. 
Since 1958, the Small Business In-
vestment 
Company 
program, 
also 
known as the SBIC program, has been 
an integral part of SBA’s mission to 
provide small businesses with capital 
and create jobs. It achieves this pur-
pose by partnering private and public 
investments 
in 
early-stage 
startup 
businesses. In fact, in 2020, the SBIC 
program provided almost $5 billion in 
financing for 1,063 small businesses and 
helped sustain almost 92,000 jobs. 
This program gives America’s small, 
high-growth companies an opportunity 
to fund and grow their innovative ideas 
and create jobs. Just look at companies 
like Apple, Tesla, or FedEx. Each has 
achieved what we all hope for every 
small business, extraordinary growth 
and success. And each of them received 
early-stage financing from SBICs. 
One of the strengths of this program 
is the hands-off approach SBA takes 
with respect to individual investments, 
giving fund managers the flexibility to 
invest in almost any business or sector 
they choose as it fits their fund’s in-
vestment strategy. 
This freedom, combined with decades 
of sound investment strategy, has led 
to its success. The SBIC program has 
helped increase the flow of patient cap-
ital to small, high-growth companies, 
but we can do more to ensure the pro-
gram continues to meet demand. 
Ms. CHU and Mr. GARBARINO’s bill 
will strengthen and grow the SBIC pro-
gram by allowing banks and Federal 
savings associations to invest up to 15 
percent of their capital and surplus 
into SBICs. This increase in capital, 
which comes at no cost to the tax-
payer, offers entrepreneurs the financ-
ing necessary to grow their businesses 
and continue to innovate. 
I applaud Ms. CHU and Mr. GARBARINO 
for identifying this issue and finding a 
sensible solution. I ask all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4256, the Investing in Main Street Act, 
as amended. 
Just last week, the Subcommittee on 
Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Ac-
cess held a hearing on the Small Busi-
ness Investment Company program, 
also known as the SBIC program. This 
program, which increases the amount 
of private equity into small businesses, 
has successfully assisted thousands of 
small businesses. 
The SBIC program is currently run-
ning on zero cost to the American tax-
payer due to the fees built into the pro-
gram. 
To enhance the program, H.R. 4256 in-
creases the amount of capital and sur-
plus that can be invested into an SBIC 
from a financial institution from 5 per-
cent to 15 percent, which is currently 
the percentage requirement of the Of-
fice of the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency. 
This important change will not only 
bring parity between the SBA and Fed-
eral financial rules, but it can also 
jump-start the program for our Na-
tion’s smallest firms. 
I would like to thank the chair for 
advancing this bill, and Ms. CHU from 
California and Mr. GARBARINO
from 
New York for working in a bipartisan 
manner to ensure this bill reached the 
House floor. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4256, which was unani-
mously reported out of our committee 
and has been passed on the House floor 
in recent congressional sessions, as 
well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6088 
November 2, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU), a sponsor of 
the bill. 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 4256, the Invest-
ing in Main Street Act, which would 
make a simple, commonsense change 
to small business investing laws to en-
sure that SBA-certified Small Business 
Investment Companies, or SBICs, can 
take full advantage of capital available 
from banks and Federal savings asso-
ciations. 
Even though banking rules allow fi-
nancial institutions to invest up to 15 
percent of their capital and surplus in 
SBICs, small business investing rules 
cap these same investments far lower, 
at just 5 percent of capital and surplus. 
The Investing in Main Street Act 
amends this outdated law to ensure 
that banks can invest the full 15 per-
cent in SBICs, a simple change that 
will dramatically increase the amount 
of investment capital available to our 
country’s small businesses. 
By raising this cap, this legislation 
will deliver more investments and 
more financing to our small businesses 
for whom even small investments can 
mean so much. Already, SBICs have 
helped companies like Tesla, Apple, 
and Intel get off the ground back when 
they were just starting out. 
SBICs fill a gap in the investment 
ecosystem and level the playing field 
by providing equity investments and fi-
nancing opportunities to the smallest 
businesses which face the highest bar-
riers to secure investments from tradi-
tional, private investors. 
The nearly 300 certified SBICs in op-
eration today have invested or com-
mitted $32 billion in small businesses 
nationwide. Last year, in my State of 
California alone, SBICs made nearly 
300 financings, totaling over $670 mil-
lion. By raising the investment cap 
from 5 to 15 percent, we could poten-
tially triple those investments in the 
years to come. That growth will be so 
important as our country continues to 
recover and rebound from the COVID 
pandemic. 
America’s small businesses have en-
dured one of the most challenging peri-
ods in our country’s history, and now is 
the time to help them rebuild and 
grow. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
GARBARINO for his partnership on this 
legislation, 
and 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
Ranking 
Member 
LUETKEMEYER for their strong support. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
GARBARINO). 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER
for 
giving me the opportunity to support 
H.R. 4256, the Investing in Main Street 
Act of 2021. 
The members of the House Small 
Business Committee, both Republican 
and Democrat, often talk about small 
businesses being the backbone of the 
U.S. economy. This is not just a talk-
ing point but a simple statement of 
fact. Small businesses are major con-
tributors to our Nation’s success and 
prosperity. As we face economic uncer-
tainty due to the pandemic, we look to 
our small businesses to be leaders in 
the private sector and to help revi-
talize our communities. 
For 63 years, the SBIC program has 
injected capital into small businesses 
by allowing financial institutions or 
Federal savings associations to invest 
in SBICs up to 5 percent. But times 
change, programs need updating, and 
now, more than ever, small businesses 
in the SBIC program need access to ad-
ditional capital. The increase from 5 
percent to 15 percent investment stipu-
lated in this bill is a necessary reform 
that will help small businesses get 
back on their feet. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league Congresswoman CHU
for her 
leadership on this issue, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, as well, so I 
will close. The SBIC program has deliv-
ered for small businesses for many 
years. It is time we update the program 
to match other Federal Rules and en-
sure the program continues to serve 
our communities in the future. This is 
a commonsense step to increase the 
amount of investment that an SBIC 
can receive. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4256, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
As the small business economy recov-
ers from the COVID–19 pandemic, en-
trepreneurs will need as many options 
for affordable capital as possible. The 
SBIC program fills the gap between the 
availability of venture and private eq-
uity capital and the needs of small 
businesses in startup and growth situa-
tions. 
For decades, this program has chan-
neled patient capital to leading-edge, 
high-growth companies. Some of our 
Nation’s most successful corporations 
received 
early-stage 
funding 
from 
SBICs. Without it, they would not be 
the companies they are today. The bill 
we are considering today will lead to 
additional investment by SBICs, which 
will, in turn, lead to strong economic 
growth in our local communities. 
The Investing in Main Street Act has 
bipartisan support, and it is endorsed 
by the Small Business Investor Alli-
ance. 
I want to applaud Ms. CHU and Mr. 
GARBARINO for their bipartisan work on 
this SBIC program. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4256, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3462) to require an annual re-
port on the cybersecurity of the Small 
Business Administration, and for other 
purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act. 
This bill directs the SBA to issue re-
ports that assess its cybersecurity in-
frastructure and report cyber threats, 
breaches, and attacks. 
For more than 25 years, the SBA’s Of-
fice of Inspector General has listed IT 
security as one of the most serious 
management and performance chal-
lenges facing the agency. These vulner-
abilities were further exposed during 
the rollout of the SBA’s COVID–19 re-
lief programs. The unprecedented de-
mand for the SBA’s relief programs in-
undated SBA’s legacy systems leading 
to back-end system crashes, portals op-
erating slowly, and a glitch that led to 
a data breach of applicants’ personal 
information. 
SBA failed to make any public an-
nouncement about the data breach, and 
it took weeks for the agency to send 
paper notifications to affected individ-
uals. 
The SBA has taken the necessary 
steps to recover from these incidents, 
but we want a notification system in 
place before the next cybersecurity 
breach. 
This bill sets new reporting require-
ments to ensure congressional and pub-
lic awareness of cyber incidents at the 
SBA. I would like to thank my col-
leagues, Mr. JASON CROW from Colorado 
and Mrs. YOUNG KIM from California, 
for introducing this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act. 
Mr. Speaker, the importance of being 
cyber ready cannot be overstated. This 
goes for individuals, businesses, and 
even our Federal Government. 
H.R. 3462 takes important strides to 
ensure the agency that was created to 
assist and aid the Nation’s smallest 
firms, the Small Business Administra-
tion, has the ability to access its own 
cybersecurity framework. 
Additionally, H.R. 3462 requires the 
SBA to report to Congress on its cyber 
infrastructure. 
Unfortunately, cyberattacks are too 
common 
in 
today’s 
world. 
Vulnerabilities will be used and taken 
advantage of by criminals. 
We must take steps now to enhance 
and protect our Federal Government. 
H.R. 3462 does just that. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) and the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM) for 
having the foresight to work on such 
an important measure. I also thank the 
chair for pushing forward this legisla-
tion. H.R. 3462 was favorably reported 
out of the Committee on Small Busi-
ness in July. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass the bill today on the House floor, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 3462, the bipartisan 
SBA Cyber Awareness Act. 
As we all know, small businesses are 
the backbone of our economy, and they 
are certainly the backbone of my com-
munity. However, these small busi-
nesses are also increasingly the target 
of cyberattacks and theft of data and 
intellectual property. 
Unfortunately, Federal agencies are 
not immune to such attacks either. 
For more than 20 years, SBA’s Office of 
Inspector General has listed IT secu-
rity as one of the most serious manage-
ment and performance challenges fac-
ing the agency. 
During the pandemic, demand for re-
lief programs like PPP and EIDL have 
overwhelmed SBA’s IT systems. As a 
result, a glitch in the EIDL application 
system led to an exposure of personal 
information of over 8,000 applicants 
with no public announcement of the 
data breach until weeks later. 
The SBA Cyber Awareness Act would 
direct SBA to issue an annual report 
assessing its cybersecurity infrastruc-
ture. The bill would also require the 
SBA to report cyber-threats, breaches, 
and cyberattacks to the House Small 
Business Committee and the Senate 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
Committee and notify affected individ-
uals and small businesses within 30 
days of an incident. 
Cyberattacks are one of the biggest 
threats to our economy, small busi-
nesses, and way of life. This bill would 
ensure that we are doing everything we 
can to protect the millions of small 
businesses that the SBA serves and 
prepare them for 21st century threats. 
I would like to thank Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
Ranking 
Member 
LUETKEMEYER for the bipartisan sup-
port and my friend, YOUNG KIM from 
California, for joining with me on this 
very important effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to join with us and support 
this bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to thank Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER
and 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
for 
their 
leadership 
in 
bringing these bipartisan pieces of leg-
islation to the House floor for votes 
today. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3462, 
the SBA Cyber Awareness Act. This is 
a bill I have had the pleasure to co-lead 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Representative 
JASON CROW of Colorado, to improve 
the Small Business Administration’s 
transparency and alert mechanisms 
when a cyberattack or intrusion takes 
place. 
Under the legislation, the SBA will 
be required to conduct an annual as-
sessment of IT equipment and cyberse-
curity capabilities and provide Con-
gress with a detailed account of any 
cybersecurity risk of SBA equipment 
that was primarily manufactured in 
the People’s Republic of China. Addi-
tionally, under this bill, the legislation 
directs the SBA Administrator to no-
tify Congress and small businesses of a 
cyberattack within 30 days after the 
SBA decides that it was subject to a 
cyber hack. 
Fifty percent of small businesses 
with 500 or less employees say it is 
very likely that they will experience a 
cyberattack in the next 12 months, and 
1 
in 
4 
are 
experiencing 
more 
cyberattacks compared to a year ago. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
SBA handled a record number of loans 
and services to help small businesses in 
need. With that came a higher number 
of sensitive personal and business in-
formation that was handled by the 
Federal Government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6090 
November 2, 2021 
We must ensure entrepreneurs and 
small business owners have the con-
fidence that the SBA has the IT capa-
bilities and tools to keep their infor-
mation safe from cyberattacks. This 
bill, H.R. 3462, is an important step in 
doing just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle to support 
H.R. 3462. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe now is the 
time to act to prepare our financial in-
stitutions for cyber intrusions. Requir-
ing the SBA to assess its own cyber in-
frastructure is an important step to en-
sure the agency can continue to serve 
as a leader for our Nation’s 31 million 
small businesses. 
Congress should make certain that 
the Federal Government is cyber pre-
pared on behalf of the Nation’s small 
businesses, entrepreneurs, and start- 
ups. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3462, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 
3462 adds new layers of Congressional 
oversight to regularly assess SBA’s IT 
and cybersecurity systems and con-
trols, and it will go a long way to in-
crease transparency in the event of an-
other IT or cyber incident. 
Congress and the American people 
need to know that the SBA’s systems 
are fully operational and capable of 
handling the next surge. This bill takes 
a step towards rebuilding the trust and 
confidence in the SBA’s IT infrastruc-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their work, I urge Members to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 3462, the ‘‘SBA Cyber Aware-
ness Act,’’ which will strengthen our knowl-
edge of cybersecurity threats to the small 
businesses of America. 
In short, this bill mainly requires that the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) conduct 
an annual report that assesses the cybersecu-
rity infrastructure of the SBA. 
Mr. Speaker, the unfortunate reality is that 
our Nation’s small businesses are under at-
tack—they are increasingly the target of cyber-
security breaches. 
In fact, the SBA has listed IT security as 
one of the most serious management chal-
lenges facing the administration for more than 
twenty years. 
Fifty percent of small businesses say that it 
is likely they will experience a cyberattack in 
the next twelve months. 
One in four small businesses indicate that 
they are facing more cyberattacks compared 
to a year ago. 
Small businesses are the backbone of this 
country, and we owe it to them to be diligently 
aware of threats to their private information 
and their livelihoods. 
That is why I rise in ardent support of the 
SBA Cyber Awareness Act, and that is why 
the bill has bipartisan backing. 
Lastly, I want to thank Congressman CROW 
and Congresswoman KIM for introducing and 
shepherding this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3462. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
SMALL BUSINESS 7(a) LOAN 
AGENT TRANSPARENCY ACT 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4481) to amend the Small 
Business Act to establish requirements 
for 7(a) agents, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657t) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new subsections: 
‘‘(j) 
REGISTRATION
SYSTEM
FOR
7(a) 
AGENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Director shall estab-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 4481, the 
Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Trans-
parency Act. 
This bill would establish a registra-
tion system for 7(a) loan agents that 
assigns each a unique identifier and 
collects data to help SBA track and 
evaluate loan performance for loans 
generated through agent activity. 
Our 
committee 
has 
consistently 
heard from agency watchdogs about 
the increased risk associated with 
loans originated through loan agents. 
In October 2021, SBA’s Office of In-
spector General identified increased 
risk introduced by loan agents as one 
of the agency’s top management and 
performance 
challenges 
facing 
the 
agency this fiscal year. 
H.R. 4481 addresses the IG’s finding 
by establishing a registry and includ-
ing loan agents as entities against 
which SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Man-
agement may issue formal or informal 
enforcement actions. 
Earlier this Congress, our committee 
approved this bipartisan bill on a unan-
imous basis, and I am proud to support 
it again today. 
I applaud my colleagues, Mr. PHIL-
LIPS and Mr. MEUSER, for identifying 
this issue and working together on a 
commonsense solution. I ask all of my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6091 
November 2, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4481, the Small Business 7(a) Loan 
Agent Transparency Act. 
I want to congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker. Not many people can pro-
nounce my last name, LUETKEMEYER, 
but you did a great job today. Thank 
you very much. 
While small businesses across the Na-
tion are bearing the burden of rising 
costs, supply chain issues, and labor 
shortages, they also continue to be 
challenged when accessing capital to 
build and grow their businesses. 
This committee remains committed 
to examining issues surrounding access 
to capital. 
The SBA’s largest government guar-
anteed loan tool is the 7(a) loan pro-
gram, which serves small businesses of 
all types throughout the Nation. 
Over the years, the role of loan 
agents within this program has ebbed 
and flowed. However, along the way, 
the SBA has not had a firm grasp on 
how these middlemen operate in the 
program. 
H.R. 4481 corrects this program by re-
quiring more transparency within the 
program about loan agents who often 
connect small businesses to lenders and 
vice versa. 
I commend the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) for working in tandem to 
bring this issue to the forefront, as 
well as Ms. TENNEY. I also would like 
to thank the Chair for working on this 
issue as well. 
H.R. 4481 will reinforce the integrity 
of the program and ensure that it con-
tinues to be a useful tool for small 
businesses moving forward. 
H.R. 4481 passed out of committee via 
voice vote. I urge all Members to sup-
port this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER 
very much, as well as Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, for working on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4481, the Small Business 7(a) Loan 
Agent Transparency Act, introduced by 
my colleague, Mr. PHILLIPS
of Min-
nesota. 
In fiscal year 2020, the SBA’s 7(a) 
loan 
program 
made 
approximately 
42,000 loans, totaling over $22 billion, 
providing 
creditworthy 
small 
busi-
nesses access to capital they could not 
obtain elsewhere. In some cases, these 
loans are facilitated by third-party 
loan agents. These loan agents can be 
attorneys, accountants, consultants, or 
others who assist a lender or borrower 
with their loan. 
As recent as last year, the SBA’s Of-
fice of Inspector General issued reports 
highlighting the need for the SBA to 
improve its oversight of loan agents. 
The SBA’s OIG cited at least 22 cases of 
confirmed loan agent fraud, totaling at 
least $335 million in taxpayer money. 
This bill addresses bipartisan con-
cerns with third-party loan agents in-
volved in the SBA 7(a) loan program by 
creating a registration system for loan 
agents that can be used to track and 
evaluate performance of loans gen-
erated by loan agents. 
I would like to thank Congressman 
PHILLIPS for working with me to ad-
dress the role loan agents play in this 
program and ensure that both Congress 
and the SBA remain good stewards of 
taxpayer dollars. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
in a bipartisan manner to ensure the 
SBA has the correct procedures in 
place for the growing number of loan 
agents within its flagship 7(a) loan pro-
gram. 
I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this 
legislation, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking 
Member LUETKEMEYER, as well as Rep-
resentative PHILLIPS and Representa-
tive MEUSER, the cosponsors of H.R. 
4481, the Small Business 7(a) Loan 
Agent Transparency Act, for their 
work on this bill. 
The Small Business Administration’s 
7(a) loan program leverages the private 
sector and community banks to expand 
capital to small businesses at afford-
able rates. Throughout my district, 
this program has provided countless 
small businesses the resources they 
need to expand their operations and 
hire additional employees. Small busi-
nesses still dominate in my district. 
Today, these loans have taken on 
even more importance, allowing em-
ployers to stay solvent through the 
pandemic. 
Overwhelming 
bipartisan 
majorities in Congress have voted to 
increase the size and loan limit of the 
program because of its vital impor-
tance. 
b 1315 
These past 2 years have also shown us 
there is still room for improvement. 
While the SBA can currently track 
loans originating from lenders, it can-
not do the same for loans originating 
from loan brokers or agents. That lack 
of transparency must be addressed. 
That is why I support H.R. 4481, the 
7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act. The 
bill will correct this shortcoming and 
protect the 7(a) loan program and tax-
payer funds. As an outspoken advocate 
for transparency and New York tax-
payers, I am pleased to see this legisla-
tion move forward. 
This bill will allow SBA to evaluate 
the performance of loan agents, per-
mitting businesses and policymakers 
to see who is most effective in helping 
employers secure financing. It will also 
make it easier for SBA to spot fraud 
and track bad actors who abuse tax-
payer resources. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
small business owners and taxpayers 
today and pass the bipartisan 7(a) Loan 
Agent Transparency Act. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers at this time, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, we have an oversight 
duty to ensure programs are operating 
effectively and efficiently. Congress 
must also ensure taxpayer dollars are 
protected 
and 
safeguarded 
against 
waste, fraud and abuse. 
Loan agents within the 7(a) program 
require more transparency, and this 
bill delivers on this important topic. 
I can assure you that as a result of IG 
reports, this is a necessary part of our 
process, and we must continue to pro-
vide the kind of oversight that is nec-
essary. Loan agents can be very help-
ful, but there are always a few bad ap-
ples. We need this transparency to be 
able to protect the integrity of this 
program and taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4481, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
As the small business economy con-
tinues its recovery, we have an oppor-
tunity to optimize SBA’s flagship cap-
ital access program. 
Today’s legislation improves SBA’s 
ability to oversee the loan agents in 
the 7(a) program and empowers the 
agency to hold noncompliant agents 
accountable. 
Currently SBA’s Office of Credit Risk 
Management conducts loan agent over-
sight as part of its periodic lender re-
views, not directly through the agents 
themselves. 
The registry established under this 
bill will improve SBA’s ability to con-
duct more targeted oversight over the 
7(a) loan agents. 
I applaud the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) for their bipartisan work to 
improve the 7(a) program. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘7(a) Loan 
Agent Oversight Act’’. 
SEC. 2. REPORT ON 7(a) AGENTS. 
Section 47 of the Small Business Act (15

the following new subsection: 
‘‘(j) ANNUAL REPORT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Director shall sub-

‘‘(D) the number and aggregate dollar 
value of referral fees paid to 7(a) agents, 
disaggregated by whether the applicant or 
7(a) lender paid such fees; 
‘‘(E) without identifying individual 7(a) 
agents by name, a consolidated analysis of 
the risk created by the individual 7(a) agents 
responsible for not less than 1 percent of— 
‘‘(i) the dollar value of loans made with the 
assistance of 7(a) agents; and 
‘‘(ii) the number of loans made with the as-
sistance of 7(a) agents;

uments); or 
‘‘(ii) consulting, broker, or referral serv-
ices with respect to a loan under section

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 4531, the 7(a) 
Loan Agent Oversight Act, companion 
legislation to H.R. 4481, the Small 
Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency 
Act. 
While H.R. 4481 would establish a reg-
istration system for 7(a) loan agents, 
this bill requires SBA to submit a re-
port to Congress assessing and ana-
lyzing the performance of 7(a) loans 
generated through loan agent activity. 
This analysis will include SBA’s pur-
chase rate for loans generated through 
loan agent activity, the aggregate dol-
lar value of referral fees paid to agents 
either by borrowers or lenders, and the 
interest rates associated with these 
loans. 
The report will also include an anal-
ysis—without 
naming 
individual 
agents—of the risk created by indi-
vidual agents responsible for gener-
ating at least 1 percent of the 7(a) port-
folio. 
SBA’s Office of Inspector General has 
repeatedly 
identified 
the 
increased 
risks to the 7(a) loan portfolio created 
by loan agents as the top agency man-
agement challenge and recommended 
the agency develop a system to register 
loan agents and monitor their perform-
ance. 
The IG’s findings about loan agent 
activity are particularly troubling. In 
one instance a loan agent fraudulently 
originated $90 million in 7(a) loans and 
received compensation from at least 19 
different lenders. 
Today’s bills on 7(a) loan agent reg-
istration and oversight will go a long 
way in providing transparency and are 
long overdue. 
Once again, I want to sincerely thank 
Mr. PHILLIPS and Mr. MEUSER for iden-
tifying this issue and collaborating on 
a sensible solution. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume and rise in support of H.R. 4531, 
the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act. 
On October 15, 2021, the SBA’s inspec-
tor general published a report titled 
‘‘Top Management and Performance 
Challenges Facing the Small Business 
Administration in Fiscal Year 2022.’’ 
In this report, the inspector general 
listed increased risks introduced by 
loan agents as one of the top issues the 
agency faces. Specifically, the report 
outlines approximately $335 million in 
documented and confirmed loan agent 
fraud within the program. This is unac-
ceptable, Mr. Speaker, and Members of 
Congress must have more visibility 
into this program. 
H.R. 4531, the 7(a) Loan Agent Over-
sight Act, requires the SBA to perform 
a portfolio risk analysis on loans asso-
ciated with agents. When this risk 
analysis is completed, Members will 
have more visibility into how loan 
agents interact with a government 
guaranteed loan program. American 
tax dollars must be protected, and H.R. 
4531 makes important improvements to 
be able to do just that. 
I thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. MEUSER) and the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) for 
tackling this legislation head on. 
With my support and the Chair’s sup-
port, H.R. 4531 was favorably reported 
out of our committee, and I encourage 
all Members to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my bill, H.R. 4531, the 7(a) 
Loan Agent Oversight Act. 
First, I would like to thank Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ and Ranking Mem-
ber LUETKEMEYER for advancing this 
bill to the House floor. I would also 
like to thank the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) for working to-
gether on this important legislation. 
The 7(a) loan program is considered 
the flagship program of the SBA. It is 
an important tool for helping small 
firms gain access to capital. Unfortu-
nately, the SBA’s Office of Inspector 
General has highlighted a need for im-
proved oversight of the 7(a) loan agents 
due to increased risk of fraud associ-
ated with these agents. 
To ensure that Congress can properly 
address these issues, we must have the 
information necessary to determine 
how to mitigate these risks. Without 
accurate information, we cannot per-
form the proper oversight that is need-
ed to safeguard and protect American 
taxpayer dollars. 
My bill will ensure that Congress re-
ceives the data it needs to conduct 
proper oversight of the 7(a) loan pro-
gram by requiring the SBA to develop 
and publish an annual portfolio risk 
analysis for Congress on loan agents 
that operate within the program. Spe-
cifically, the analysis will examine the 
number of fraudulent loans that are as-
sociated with the loan agents as well as 
the default rate of the loans associated 
with these agents. 
At the end of the day, these are gov-
ernment programs that were developed 
to assist small businesses in gaining 
access to capital. Given this important 
mission, Congress and the SBA must 
conduct the appropriate level of over-
sight. 
The information that will be pro-
vided to Congress under H.R. 4531 will 
be paramount as we measure the effec-
tiveness of these programs and whether 
the SBA has the correct oversight re-
quirements in place to administer such 
a significant program.

For that reason, I urge my colleagues 
to support H.R. 4531, the 7(a) Loan 
Agent Oversight Act. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Continued and ongoing fraud within 
any government program is unaccept-
able and must be addressed imme-
diately. H.R. 4531 is a step in the right 
direction and will provide crucial infor-
mation for Members of Congress as 
well as committee members as they 
continue to exercise necessary over-
sight of programs directed at small 
businesses and entrepreneurs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4531, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The two bills we are considering 
today go hand in hand and will also go 
a long way to enhance transparency in 
the 7(a) program. 
Over the last year, our committee 
has focused on relief programs, but we 
never lost sight of our traditional lend-
ing programs. Today, we turn our at-
tention to the core SBA loan programs 
and ensure they are working as best as 
they can. 
The report required under this bill 
will help Congress and the public bet-
ter understand the role loan agents 
play in the 7(a) program, whether they 
improve access to capital for entre-
preneurs, and the impact of potential 
bad actors in this space, especially as 
it relates to portfolio risk. 
Though lenders bear primary respon-
sibility for monitoring their agents, 
only SBA is positioned to aggregate 
loan agent portfolios, evaluate their 
performance, and inform lenders and 
policymakers about concerning pro-
gram risks or trends. 
Once again, I want to salute the work 
of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) and the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). I encour-
age all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4531. 
The question was taken.

SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
CENTER CYBER TRAINING ACT 
OF 2021 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4515) to amend the Small 
Business Act to require cyber certifi-
cation for small business development 
center counselors, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4515 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Busi-
ness Development Center Cyber Training Act 
of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. DUTIES OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOP-
MENT CENTER COUNSELORS. 
Section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 
U.S.C. 648) is amended by adding at the end 
the following: 
‘‘(o) CYBER STRATEGY TRAINING FOR SMALL 
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS.— 
‘‘(1) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection— 
‘‘(A) the term ‘cyber strategy’ means re-
sources and tactics to assist in planning for 
cybersecurity and defending against cyber 
risks and cyber attacks; and 
‘‘(B) the term ‘lead small business develop-
ment center’ means a small business devel-
opment center that has received a grant 
from the Administration. 
‘‘(2) CERTIFICATION PROGRAM.—The Admin-
istrator shall establish a cyber counseling 
certification program, or approve a similar 
existing program, to certify the employees of 
lead small business development centers to 
provide cyber planning assistance to small 
business concerns. 
‘‘(3) NUMBER
OF
CERTIFIED
EMPLOYEES.— 
The Administrator shall ensure that the 
number of employees of each lead small busi-
ness development center who are certified in 
providing cyber planning assistance under 
this subsection is not fewer than the lesser 
of— 
‘‘(A) 5; or 
‘‘(B) 10 percent of the total number of em-
ployees of the lead small business develop-
ment center. 
‘‘(4) CONSIDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESS DE-
VELOPMENT CENTER CYBER STRATEGY.—In car-
rying out this subsection, the Administrator, 
to the extent practicable, shall consider any 
cyber strategy methods included in the 
Small Business Development Center Cyber 
Strategy developed under section 1841(a) of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328; 130 
Stat. 2662). 
‘‘(5) REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTIFICATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to the avail-
ability of appropriations and subparagraph 
(B), the Administrator shall reimburse a lead 
small business development center for costs 
relating to the certification of an employee 
of the lead small business development cen-
ter under the program established under 
paragraph (2). 
‘‘(B) LIMITATION.—The total amount reim-
bursed by the Administrator under subpara-
graph (A) may not exceed $350,000 in any fis-
cal year.’’.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from

Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.

There was no objection.

Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4515, the Small Business Development 
Center Cyber Training Act. This legis-
lation will enable Small Business De-
velopment Centers, SBDCs, to better 
assist small businesses with their cy-
bersecurity needs. 
Small businesses often lack the re-
sources, training, or technical knowl-
edge to prevent a cyberattack before it 
happens. In the past year alone, 47 per-
cent of small businesses experienced a 
cyberattack, and out of those, 44 per-
cent experienced more than one. 
A cyberattack can cripple a small 
business, and the repercussions can be 
felt across the supply chain. In fact, 
the cost of a single breach can cost up-
wards of $200,000 or more. During hear-
ings over the years, my committee has 
heard heartbreaking stories of how just 
one cyberattack forced companies to 
close their doors permanently. 
Today’s legislation takes action to 
provide much-needed resources to any 
small company, whether it is our local 
pizza shop or an independent Uber driv-
er, to educate and protect themselves 
from growing cybercrime. 
Because SBDCs have a proven record 
of understanding the needs of small 
businesses, H.R. 4515 would establish a 
cyber counseling certification program 
in SBDCs to provide specific, free-of- 
charge cyber training for small enti-
ties. 
The cyber training provided by the 
nationwide network of SBDCs will offer 
crucial resources for small employers 
to plan and implement cybersecurity 
protections and combat cyberattacks. 
I thank my colleagues, Mr. ANDREW 
GARBARINO from New York, Mr. STEVE 
CHABOT
from Ohio, and Mr. DWIGHT 
EVANS and Ms. CHRISSY HOULAHAN from 
Pennsylvania, for their work on this 
bill. I am confident that the bipartisan 
work of the Small Business Committee 
will better fortify our Nation’s cyber 
infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I rise in support of H.R. 4515, 
the Small Business Development Cen-
ter Cyber Training Act of 2021. 
Small Business Development Cen-
ters, or SBDCs, perform numerous im-
portant roles for small businesses and 
aspiring entrepreneurs. They are also

on the front lines, assisting small busi-
ness owners with business plans and 
questions regarding access to capital. 
Unfortunately, cyberattacks are on 
the rise, and small businesses remain 
vulnerable. H.R. 4515 requires SBDCs to 
be better equipped and trained to assist 
small businesses with their cybersecu-
rity needs. 
More attention needs to be given to 
small businesses and how they deal 
with cyber intrusions. Empowering 
SBDCs is one way to do this. 
I thank the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. GARBARINO), the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS), the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), 
and the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania (Ms. HOULAHAN) for their work 
on this bill. I also thank the chair for 
continuing to act on legislation dealing 
with cybersecurity, one of the most 
critical issues facing us today. 
Overall, these are crucial and impor-
tant issues facing small businesses, and 
I am grateful for the gentlewoman’s 
partnership on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4515, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN). 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER for the 
opportunity to support this bill. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4515, the 
Small Business Development Center 
Cyber Training Act, which increases 
the ability of Small Business Develop-
ment Centers across our country to 
provide cybersecurity planning assist-
ance and counseling to small busi-
nesses. This important bill requires 
that at least five staff members, or 10 
percent of the total number of employ-
ees, in each Small Business Develop-
ment Center in the country are cer-
tified in cybersecurity planning and as-
sistance. 
My community is fortunate to have 
two Small Business Development Cen-
ters, one in Reading and one in Exton. 
As a former entrepreneur myself before 
joining Congress, I know intimately 
and firsthand how important these cen-
ters are. I am grateful for their com-
mitment to help entrepreneurs get 
their businesses off the ground, estab-
lish themselves, and ultimately to 
thrive. With the enactment of this bi-
partisan bill, they will be able to help 
more small businesses in southeastern 
Pennsylvania 
defend 
against 
cyberattacks. 
I want to make the following clear to 
everyone in Congress and across Amer-
ica: If we are not protecting our small 
businesses, we are not protecting our 
economy. The rise in cyberattacks 
against our economy and our economic 
infrastructure should be cause for very 
serious alarm. We need to be doing ev-
erything in our power to not only shore 
up our defense but also to equip our 
small business owners with the tools 
that they need to defend their busi-
nesses. 
I was proud to introduce this bipar-
tisan bill with my colleagues, ANDREW 
GARBARINO
from New York, STEVE 
CHABOT from Ohio, and my friend and 
colleague from Pennsylvania, DWIGHT 
EVANS. I thank the Small Business 
Committee chair, NYDIA
VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
again for helping bring this important 
bill to a vote in the House today. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this very important 
bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
GARBARINO). 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman and ranking 
member for allowing this bill, the 
Small Business Development Center 
Cyber Training Act, to come to the 
floor today. I also want to thank the 
Representatives for their support who 
are cosponsors: Representatives EVANS, 
CHABOT, HOULAHAN, PHILLIPS, TENNEY, 
DELGADO, RICE, and GOTTHEIMER. 
Cyberattacks are on the rise, and 
small businesses are increasingly vul-
nerable. 
Nearly 
50 
percent 
of 
cyberattacks are directed at small 
businesses, which can result in dev-
astating financial, intellectual prop-
erty, and reputational loss. 
Small businesses are targeted be-
cause they often lack the resources or 
technical knowledge needed to imple-
ment and maintain cybersecurity de-
fenses. This bill combats this by help-
ing Small Business Development Cen-
ters become better equipped to assist 
small businesses and their cybersecu-
rity and cyber strategy needs. 
Combating cyberattacks and putting 
small businesses in the best position to 
prevent and respond to cyberattacks 
has become one of my top priorities as 
a Member of Congress. As a member of 
both the Small Business Committee 
and the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security’s Sub-
committee on Cybersecurity, Infra-
structure Protection, and Innovation, I 
have seen how difficult it is for small 
businesses to arm themselves against 
these kinds of attacks. 
This bill provides much-needed re-
sources to help small businesses im-
prove their cyber preparedness in the 
face of rising threats. I urge my col-
leagues to support and pass H.R. 4515. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we must take a serious 
look at how businesses are impacted by 
cyberattacks. Small businesses operate 
on thin margins. Thus, a cyber intru-
sion could be a lethal blow to them. 
SBDCs must be ready to assist all 
small businesses where cyber questions 
arise. This is a smart and common-
sense bill that should move forward. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
4515 and all the small business bills 
that have been before us today. Each 
bill tackles important issues facing 
American job creators. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, our national cybersecu-
rity infrastructure is only as strong as 
our weakest links. America’s small 
companies need the same cybersecurity 
protections as Fortune 500 businesses 
and the Federal Government but often 
lack the resources. 
This bill would go a long way in as-
sisting small businesses with their cy-
bersecurity needs. The training and re-
sources provided by SBDCs will offer 
crucial resources for small businesses 
to plan and implement cybersecurity 
protections and minimize the damage 
of cyber incidents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.

TERMINATING 
DESIGNATION 
OF 
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC RE-
PUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA, THE RE-
PUBLIC OF GUINEA, AND THE 
REPUBLIC OF MALI AS BENE-
FICIARY SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES UNDER THE AGOA— 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. 
NO. 117–70) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and referred to 
the Committee on Ways and Means and 
ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
In 
accordance 
with 
section 
506A(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)(B)), I 
am providing advance notification of 
my intent to terminate the designation 
of the Federal Democratic Republic of 
Ethiopia (Ethiopia), the Republic of 
Guinea (Guinea), and the Republic of 
Mali (Mali) as beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). 
I am taking this step as Ethiopia, 
Guinea, and Mali are not in compliance 
with the eligibility requirements of 
section 104 of the AGOA—in Ethiopia, 
for gross violations of internationally 
recognized human rights; in Guinea, 
for not having established, or not mak-
ing continual progress toward estab-
lishing, the protection of the rule of 
law and of political pluralism; and in 
Mali, for not having established, or not 
making continual progress toward es-
tablishing, the protection of the rule of 
law, political pluralism, and inter-
nationally recognized worker rights, 
and for not addressing gross violations 
of internationally recognized human 
rights. 
Despite intensive engagement be-
tween the United States and the Gov-
ernments of Ethiopia, Guinea, and 
Mali, these governments have failed to 
address United States concerns about 
their noncompliance with the AGOA 
eligibility criteria. 
Accordingly, I intend to terminate 
the designation of Ethiopia, Guinea, 
and Mali as beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries under the AGOA as 
of January 1, 2022. I will continue to as-
sess whether the Governments of Ethi-
opia, Guinea, and Mali are making con-
tinual progress toward meeting the 
AGOA eligibility requirements.

RECOGNIZING KATHY ARO 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kathy Aro for her 17 
years of service to the families of 
southeastern Michigan through her 
work at the Accounting Aid Society. 
Kathy has led the Accounting Aid Soci-
ety in fulfilling its mission to help put 
the residents of southeast Michigan on 
the pathway to financial stability. 
Her leadership has been a catalyst for 
massive growth of Accounting Aid So-
ciety’s free income tax assistance pro-
gram, which puts hard-earned dollars 
back into the pockets of many of our 
vulnerable families. 
Under Kathy’s leadership, Account-
ing Aid Society has expanded its pro-
gramming to include Accounting Aid 
Academy, which provides basic small 
business guidance and financial coach-
ing. 
In short, Kathy has been an out-
standing 
community 
leader, 
culti-
vating Accounting Aid Society into a 
trusted community partner. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
recognizing Kathy’s outstanding con-
tributions 
to 
the 
communities 
of 
Michigan’s 13th Congressional District 
as we wish her well in her retirement.

nize the November 1984 anti-Sikh riots 
in India, also commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Sikh Massacre.’’ 
Sikhism, which originated in Punjab, 
India, saw its followers first begin im-
migrating to our shores nearly 130 
years ago. The Sikh community is one 
of the largest in the world, with rough-
ly 30 million followers globally and 
more than half a million here in the 
United States. 
The massacre against the Sikhs 
began in the capital territory of Delhi 
and a number of other major Indian 
cities on November 1, 1984, following 
the assassination of Indian Prime Min-
ister Indira Gandhi. The first Sikh life 
was tragically taken early that morn-
ing in East Delhi. 
The violence, which lasted 3 days, re-
sulted in thousands upon thousands of 
casualties among the Sikh community. 
In the aftermath of the massacre, it 
was reported that nearly 20,000 were 
forced to flee the city, leading to 
countless displaced people. 
Madam Speaker, remembering the 
Sikh Massacre is a pivotal and historic 
step in the fight for justice and ac-
countability for the families of all 
those victims.

SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLORIDA 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, today 
the House just passed the Senate sub-
stitute for our bill, the bipartisan H.R. 
164, and it now heads to President 
Biden’s desk. It helps right an injus-
tice. 
Historically, land has been held in 
trust for Tribes by the Federal Govern-
ment, as is the case for the Seminole 
Tribe of Florida. In modern times, this 
has become a cumbersome process. 
The bill itself was necessary to allow 
the Seminole Tribe to engage in cer-
tain land transactions that were inter-
preted as necessary by a congressional 
bill, by the Indian Non-Intercourse 
Act, so this would allow them to fi-
nally engage in those land trans-
actions. 
It is critical for the Seminoles and 
other Tribes to be able to conduct their 
affairs without having to go to Con-
gress every time. Comprehensive re-
form is needed in the future, and we ap-
preciate the support in the House 
today to send this very good bill to 
President Biden.

FORCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on the 
subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I come to the floor this evening 
with a number of my Republican col-
leagues to speak about the small busi-
ness economy. 
Small business owners have been dev-
astated by the COVID–19 pandemic as 
they are still reeling from the Demo-
crat-induced State and local shutdowns 
and economic downturn. At a time 
when Main Street USA has been fo-
cused on recovering from the health 
and economic effects of the pandemic, 
they are facing multiple challenges 
created by the Biden administration 
and congressional Democrats. 
Given our country’s unprecedented 
labor shortage, skyrocketing inflation, 
and supply chain crisis, small busi-
nesses, entrepreneurs, and startups 
alike are forced to bear the brunt of 
the Democrats’ failed economic poli-
cies. In the midst of this economic 
storm, small businesses should be given 
the tools to recover, but now they are 
also being threatened with major tax 
increases and more burdensome regula-
tions. 
Since President Biden took office, we 
have seen multiple Democratic pro-
posals that include increasing taxes on 
small businesses. Make no mistake: 
Tax hikes, no matter their form and 
fashion, will negatively impact Main 
Street USA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6105 
November 2, 2021 
A survey by the Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Council found a ma-
jority of small business owners believe 
new taxes will significantly hurt their 
ability to recover from the pandemic. 
Simply put, this is unacceptable. 
While the Democrats’ socialist scam 
reconciliation bill continues to change 
week after week, many of these pro-
posals would slash the 20 percent small 
business deduction enacted by Presi-
dent Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017. According to IRS data, millions of 
small business owners claimed the 20 
percent deduction on qualified business 
income during the 2020 tax filing sea-
son. This provision created more than 
$66 billion in savings for small business 
owners in 2019. The Democrats want to 
do away with this. 
Other reckless proposals will have 
nearly doubled the long-term capital 
gains rate from 23.8 percent to the top 
ordinary capital gains rate of 39.6 per-
cent. According to U.S. Census Bureau 
data, two-thirds of small business own-
ers plan to sell their business, and 
eliminating the current long-term rate 
would have enormous implications for 
any sale of a small business. 
Knowing this information, I must 
ask: Why would the Democrats propose 
such drastic tax rate increases know-
ing they will crush American busi-
nesses? 
As the days evolve, we will see what 
the Democrats will concoct next to pay 
for their outrageous spending, but Re-
publicans refuse to stand by and allow 
them to pay for it at the expense of 
small business prosperity. We will con-
tinue to monitor very closely. 
At a time when small businesses are 
trying to get back on their feet, they 
are also absorbing the impact of other 
damage. As ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs be-
come a common sight on the doors of 
small businesses across the country 
and store shelves become increasingly 
bare, it remains clear that the Biden 
administration’s labor crisis is a key 
contributing factor to the rising costs 
of goods and empty shelves. 
For months, the Biden administra-
tion has paid Americans to stay home 
through extended Federal benefits in-
stead of incentivizing these individuals 
to return to work. Our country’s labor 
shortages have hindered the ability to 
get cargo to shore, unpack these much- 
needed goods, and find truck drivers to 
transport the products throughout the 
Nation. U.S. employers across all in-
dustries are struggling to fill more 
than 10.4 million job openings to meet 
the rising consumer demand. 
Madam Speaker, in October, NFIB re-
ported that 51 percent of small business 
owners have unfilled job openings, a 48- 
year high for the third consecutive 
month. Sadly, the historical average is 
only 22 percent. 
As small business owners are bearing 
the burden of these extreme challenges 
due to the Democrats’ failed economic 
policies, they are also facing regu-
latory uncertainty. During the pre-
vious administration, we cut burden-
some red tape for small firms. How-
ever, we are already seeing an increas-
ing regulatory trend with the Biden ad-
ministration, which will hinder small 
businesses 
while 
they 
are 
already 
down. 
We know that regulatory burdens de-
flate small businesses, yet this admin-
istration continues to plow forward 
with new restrictions and mandates. 
From the latest climate rules to the 
overreaching vaccine mandate, small 
business owners should be given the op-
portunity to recover from the pan-
demic and service their customers, not 
deal with even more bureaucratic red 
tape from the Democrats. 
Beyond these economic headwinds, 
American taxpayer dollars have been 
wasted and abused by Federal Govern-
ment agencies throughout the pan-
demic. According to the Small Busi-
ness Administration’s inspector gen-
eral, $78 billion in Economic Injury 
Disaster Loans have been fraudulent. 
This program is a direct loan and 
grant program, as small businesses 
apply directly with the SBA for fund-
ing. Instead of developing serious over-
sight controls, congressional Demo-
crats want to expand the Federal Gov-
ernment’s ability to make additional 
direct loans through the SBA. This is 
dangerous and puts taxpayer dollars at 
extreme risk. These proposals are irre-
sponsibly opening the door for en-
hanced fraud. 
My Republican colleagues and I will 
continue to fight for lower taxes and 
deregulation on behalf of small busi-
nesses across the Nation while also 
safeguarding taxpayer dollars every 
step of the way. We must legislate re-
sponsibly, and we will. Americans must 
get back to work, and that can only 
happen when Democrats cease their 
war on Main Street. 
Congressional Republicans refuse to 
stand by and allow the Democrats to 
force through this socialist scam rec-
onciliation bill at the expense of small 
business prosperity. 
I appreciate that a number of my Re-
publican colleagues are here today to 
add to this conversation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS), 
who is the vice ranking member of the 
Small Business Committee. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Missouri for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as a 
small business owner for 51 years. I 
still have a business; I still employ 
hundreds of people; and I want to be a 
voice for my constituents in Texas-25 
and to call attention to the dangerous 
socialist policies—yes, I said socialist— 
that Democrats are, once again, trying 
to jam through the people’s House. 
President Biden inherited a strong 
economy 
from 
President 
Trump— 
frankly, as good as I have ever seen in 
50 years of being in business. But in 
less than a year, President Biden and 
Democrats want to crush small busi-
nesses with higher taxes and increased 
regulations, extend supply chain short-
ages, and keep workers on the bleacher 
seats with continued government hand-
outs. 
The government should not be paying 
people to sit on the couch or imposing 
tax hikes and regulations that will 
damage small businesses that are al-
ready struggling with record job open-
ings because of government giveaways. 
As a small business owner, as I said, 
for over 50 years, I understand first-
hand the negative impacts of increased 
taxes and how excessive regulations 
can hinder growth and kill startup op-
portunities. 
I have seen firsthand how the supply 
chain crisis is halting U.S. production. 
I see it in my business today, in the 
auto business, which the Biden admin-
istration refuses to acknowledge or let 
alone address. 
Small businesses are hurting. Main 
Street America is still struggling to re-
cover, and it is hurting. Banks are try-
ing to provide increased access to cap-
ital, but they are being forced to hire 
more compliance officers than loan of-
ficers. 
Burdensome, 
overreaching 
govern-
ment policies have real impacts on 
small business owners and the commu-
nities who depend on them. We do not 
need the Federal Government to tell 
entrepreneurs—people who take risks— 
how to operate their businesses. Rath-
er, it should foster a properly regulated 
economy that creates opportunity for 
all. 
Main Street America is the backbone 
to our economy, and small businesses 
employ more Americans than any 
other sector there is. Hundreds of small 
businesses in my district in Texas and 
across the country will experience the 
negative effects of President Biden’s 
and Speaker PELOSI’s socialist poli-
cies—yes, I said socialist policies—as 
they chart a course to destroy Main 
Street, increase taxes, and make the 
people more reliant on the government. 
Madam Speaker, I will continue to 
oppose any efforts to raise taxes or ef-
forts to make it harder for businesses 
to compete. I encourage Democrats to 
end their relentless campaign to make 
America more like China and Russia. It 
just doesn’t work. But competing with 
less government regulation does. The 
bottom line is: Risk and reward equal 
the American Dream. 
In God We Trust. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Texas 
for his insights. Being a businessman 
himself, he understands full well the 
problems that they have, the concerns 
about the bill being proposed, and the 
impact of all the decisions that this ad-
ministration has made so far. 
The key to economic success is eco-
nomic freedom. That is a keyword, and 
you are going to hear a theme of that 
this evening, Madam Speaker.

Next, I would like to introduce the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6106 
November 2, 2021 
the ranking member of the Financial 
Services Subcommittee on National 
Security, International Development 
and Monetary Policy. I look forward to 
his commentary and his insights. He is 
instrumental in a lot of the different 
things we do there, as well the former 
chairman of the Oversight Committee, 
if I am not mistaken. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Missouri, a real 
leader on the Financial Services Com-
mittee, and also our ranking Repub-
lican and leader on the Small Business 
Committee and tireless champion for 
America’s small businesses. That is 
where all of the jobs are created in this 
country. 
For the life of me, Madam Speaker, 
on the heels of horrible third-quarter 
GDP numbers, I don’t know why the 
Biden administration wants to put new 
taxes on small businesses. The GDP 
numbers for the third quarter were far 
short of what economists predicted 
and, yet President Biden’s plan to so- 
called Build Back Better is actually a 
$400 billion tax hike on job-creating 
small businesses. 
The bulk of this comes from an ex-
pansion of the 3.8 percent net invest-
ment income tax that is now going to 
hit active income for these pass- 
through 
businessowners. 
Democrats 
want to expand this to investment in-
come of individuals actively involved 
in LLCs, S corporations, and partner-
ships, those small mom-and-pop Main 
Street businesses that really create 
jobs in our country. 
Additionally, the Democrats are also 
pushing an $800 billion tax hike on 
American businesses that will be a gift 
to China, Russia, Japan, and Europe, 
making it better to be a foreign com-
pany than an American one. These 
crippling tax hikes will kill American 
jobs, drive economic activity overseas, 
and destroy small businesses as they 
struggle to recover from the pandemic. 
As if this wasn’t bad enough, Demo-
crats want to arm the Internal Rev-
enue Service with $80 billion in addi-
tional funds to target American small 
businesses and families. So not only 
will small businesses in Kentucky have 
their taxes go up, but they should pre-
pare for an avalanche of new audits 
coming their way courtesy of this Big 
Government socialist bill. 
On top of that, this legislation will 
only add fuel to the fire of the burning 
inflation crisis. This year the Con-
sumer Price Index is up 5.4 percent, the 
highest in 13 years, but the Personal 
Consumption Expenditure Index, less 
food and energy costs, is up 3.6 percent, 
well above the Fed’s 2 percent target 
and the highest in over 30 years. 
Madam Speaker, the longer this in-
flation surge drags on, the risk of infla-
tion becoming embedded in our econ-
omy grows more and more. This multi-
trillion-dollar Big Government social-
ist tax-borrow-and-spend bill will bury 
American entrepreneurs in taxes and 
debt. But one interest group that will 
be happy with this Big Government so-
cialist bill, if it passes, are the unions 
that fund the Democratic Party. 
Tucked inside of this bill is a pro-
posal to provide a $4,500 additional in-
centive 
exclusively 
for 
union-built 
electric vehicles. This provision runs 
counter to the Democrats’ purported 
goal of reducing carbon emissions and 
getting more electric vehicles on the 
road. That is because nearly half of all 
U.S. 
automotive 
production 
comes 
from automakers with workforces who 
have chosen to not unionize. In fact, of 
the 60 automakers in the United States 
who build electric vehicles, only 2 are 
unionized. So Democrats are effec-
tively pitting American autoworkers 
at union plants against the auto-
workers who work in my congressional 
district at the Toyota manufacturing 
plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, the 
largest Toyota manufacturing plant in 
the world. But small businesses are im-
pacted because small businesses that 
are not unionized are part of the supply 
chain. 
So let me be clear: There is no envi-
ronmental benefit or additional carbon 
reduction achieved by favoring union- 
made vehicles over nonunion-made ve-
hicles. While Democrats lecture about 
the need to provide alternatives to the 
combustion engine, to gas-powered ve-
hicles, the irony here is that this bill 
greatly restricts the ability for tax 
credits to actually reach consumers. 
This is because Democrats are limiting 
the tax credit to union-built, U.S.-as-
sembled vehicles and applying these 
proposed limitations to the current EV 
market. Estimates indicate that only 2 
of over 50 electric vehicles would qual-
ify for the full tax credit. 
This is not building back better. This 
is a payoff to political supporters. 
Nearly half of all U.S. automotive pro-
duction comes from automakers with 
workforces that have chosen to not 
unionize. Why are we punishing these 
manufacturers of electric vehicles? Be-
cause it is not about the environment. 
It is not about promoting electric vehi-
cles. It is about a political payoff to 
union supporters of these campaigns. 
This provision is nothing more than 
that; a payoff to the union bosses who 
control Democrat politicians in Con-
gress and the Democrat in the White 
House. 
We should be for small businesses. 
And if we are for the environment, we 
shouldn’t discriminate against non-
union automakers and the small busi-
nesses that support nonunion manufac-
turers like Toyota in Kentucky’s Sixth 
Congressional District. 
I thank my friend from Missouri for 
his leadership in opposing this massive 
tax increase on small businesses and 
for helping me highlight the hypocrisy 
of the supporters of this bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Ken-
tucky. As you can see and hear from 
him, his very insightful explanation of 
the bill and its provisions, its effects 
on small businesses and consumers, he 
gave a very, very thoughtful expla-
nation of it, and we appreciate his in-
sights and concerns. 
There are lots of problems with the 
bill, and I appreciate Mr. BARR’s com-
ments. 
Next, we have the gentleman from 
Louisiana, (Mr. JOHNSON). Mike is 
going to be with us here. He is vice- 
chairman 
of 
the 
Republican 
Con-
ference. He is going to continue to ex-
plain some of the problems and pitfalls 
with this tax proposal that is an un-
wieldy and, frankly, harmful bill to our 
people, our consumers, and especially 
the small businesses in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, Ranking 
Member LUETKEMEYER, and all of our 
Republican colleagues on the Small 
Business Committee for leading this 
very important discussion this evening. 
And this is very important. 
Madam Speaker, the Democrats’ rad-
ical multitrillion-dollar agenda is bad 
for America. It just is, and we can all 
see it. The voters can see that, too. In 
fact, while we are here right now, there 
are still voters lining up just down the 
road in Virginia. They cannot wait to 
vote for their next Governor. It is a 
race that is currently classified as a 
toss-up but it appears to be going very, 
very well for the Republican candidate. 
The reason this is so noteworthy, the 
reason everybody in the country is 
watching this, the reason that every-
one is so excited that it is a toss-up 
election is because this is in a State 
that President Biden won by 10 points 
just several months ago. And there are 
simply no conclusions to draw other 
than that the Democrats are leading 
our country down the wrong path. That 
is what the polling says and even the 
mainstream media outlets have had to 
report on that in the last few days. 
It is the content of this tax-and- 
spend agenda, and not just the cost, 
that is especially dangerous for Amer-
ican families and our economy overall. 
You just have to think about the harm-
ful effects the Democrat bill is going to 
have on our local businesses, many of 
whom, by the way, we all know are al-
ready operating on shorter hours due 
to the current labor shortage. But spe-
cifically, the legislation that is being 
debated and pushed through even this 
week is that the Democrats want to in-
crease OSHA penalties, increase pen-
alties on small businesses. That is a 
tax. They want to reduce the pass- 
through deduction. That is a tax. They 
want to increase the regulatory burden 
on small business owners at the worst 
possible time. You know what this 
amounts to? A tax. They want to make 
the child tax credit pay the same 
whether you are working or not, which 
what will that do? Logically, it will ex-
acerbate the current labor shortage. 
So let me repeat. The Democrat bill, 
in spite of what they are saying, will 
definitely increase taxes while prices

November 2, 2021 
are soaring. It will increase workplace 
penalties while companies are trying 
their best to get back to work, and it 
will encourage people not to work 
while the job market struggles, and our 
supply chain is slowed down due to a 
lack of workers in these critical posi-
tions. 
There are nearly 32 million small 
businesses in the United States. About 
350,000 of those are in my home State 
of Louisiana. They are our main em-
ployer. They employ more Louisian-
ians than any big company or the gov-
ernment. This is the mainstay. This is 
the lifeblood of our economy. You are 
talking about deli managers and bar-
bershop owners, and bookstore owners. 
You name it. 
Small businesses across the country 
had to fight tooth and nail to survive 
the COVID–19 pandemic. The last thing 
this Congress needs to do is make it 
more difficult for these businesses. 
But that is exactly what our Demo-
crat colleagues are trying to do. As for 
the rest of the bill, well, they are still 
working on it, they tell us. We heard 
today there may be some deal on pre-
scription drugs. Who knows? We have 
to see how that goes. There have been 
lots of promises broken—made and bro-
ken—here the last few weeks. 
Meanwhile, the Democrats are still 
trying to include amnesty in this 
spending bill. What that has to do with 
the reconciliation, we have no idea. 
Hopefully, the Parliamentarian on the 
Senate side will put another kibosh on 
this. But they want to include tax 
breaks for wealthy New Yorkers and 
just a bunch of terrible ideas. 
I have to digress for just a moment 
and talk about this amnesty problem, 
because not only will that be another 
burden on our small businesses; not 
only will it really take jobs away from 
law-abiding citizens, but you have to 
consider the insatiable appetite that 
our friends on the other side of the 
aisle have for amnesty. 
We spent about 13 hours in the Judi-
ciary Committee about 3 weeks ago 
working on their effort. The Democrats 
pushed that through to graft amnesty 
onto the spending bill. And after all of 
those hours, near the very end—late at 
night—we asked them if there was any 
end to this appetite they have for am-
nesty. We are talking about as many as 
10 million illegals who have come 
across the border. And we brought a 
few amendments and we talked about 
this in our Conference, but we said, you 
know, gee, if you are going to grant 
amnesty and you all have the votes in 
the committee to move this through, 
we understand that, but we just want 
to see if there is any limit on who you 
might include in amnesty. 
So we brought an amendment to the 
bill and said: What if someone is a 
known MS–13 gang member? Surely, 
you would want to exclude them from 
your amnesty plan. And I will tell you, 
every single Democrat on our com-
mittee voted that amendment down. Of 
course, every Republican voted ‘‘yes.’’ 
Then we said: Well, well, wait a 
minute. What if somebody is a con-
victed is sex offender, somebody com-
ing from another country and they are 
a convicted sex offender? Surely, you 
would not want to include them in 
your amnesty plan. Every single Demo-
crat voted ‘‘no’’ on that amendment. 
So I brought an amendment. I said: 
What if someone is a convicted crimi-
nal, and they are convicted of DUI, 
driving under the influence of alcohol 
and drugs, a terrible crime, as you all 
have said in your speeches in recent 
years? It kills thousands of Americans 
every year. It maims hundreds of thou-
sands. Surely, if someone has been con-
victed of at least one DUI, you would 
not want to include them in your am-
nesty plan. Every Democrat voted it 
down. 
So we tested it a little further. Okay, 
what if they have two or more DUI 
convictions? Every Democrat voted it 
down. So I went to 10 or more DUI con-
victions, would they be excluded from 
your magical amnesty plan? Every sin-
gle Democrat voted ‘‘no’’ on that 
amendment. Every single one. There is 
no limit to what they want to do with 
this. 
The one thing they do know, they 
want to spend trillions and trillions of 
our tax dollars before we know the 
score on all of this, before the actual 
text of the legislation has even been 
read. They are ready to roll. Democrats 
have a mere three-seat majority in this 
House. We have a 50–50 split in the Sen-
ate. They are acting as if they have 
some sort of big majority to radically 
transform the country, as they keep 
telling us. And what they have pre-
sented is the most partisan, most ex-
pensive legislation package in the his-
tory of this country, using the slim-
mest majority possible, and before they 
even tell the American people what is 
in it. 
Make no mistake, a toss-up election 
in Virginia is just a taste of what is to 
come for congressional Democrats in 
2022 if they do not immediately ditch 
this 
ridiculous 
spending 
plan 
and 
harmful government overreach. 
I just say this: Today we have a bat-
tle that comes down to competing 
ideologies and agendas. It is now free- 
market capitalism versus Big Govern-
ment socialism. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to have a minor discus-
sion with the gentleman here. 
You made a couple of points here 
with regards to some of the discussions 
you had with regards to amnesty. Did 
one of the questions that you posed 
deal with the $450,000 payment that the 
President is proposing to all of the 
folks who come here illegally? Was 
that voted on or talked about at all in 
your discussion? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I yield to the 
gentleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. So I 
wish that that proposal had been on 
the table before we got out of that par-
ticular hearing because we certainly 
would have liked to have heard about 
that. But if you add that up, you are 
talking about perhaps $1 million per 
family, and $1 billion in cost overall, 
more costs to the American taxpayer. 
And by the way, that little payment 
that the illegal migrants would be 
given by the American taxpayer is 
more than we give to Gold Star fami-
lies, persons who have been lost in the 
line of duty, as you know. It is more 
than the victims of 9/11 that they have 
received for their pain and suffering. 
And, of course, those separations are 
permanent, not temporary. It is just 
not right. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. So we could be 
giving a $450,000 payment to a MS–13 
gang member; is what you are saying? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. That is 
what it means, and convicted sex of-
fenders, and multiple DUI-convicted 
felons, and everybody else. They have 
included them all. There is no limit to 
it at all. Isn’t that outrageous? 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. It doesn’t seem 
to bother them that they are going to 
spend their own constituents’ hard- 
earned tax dollars and give to a MS–13 
gang member up to $450,000. Holy 
smokes. It blows you away. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. It is in-
credible. You can’t make this stuff up. 
b 1815 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for his in-
sightful discussion and presentation. I 
am glad he pointed out that the social-
ist agenda of this administration is 
being rejected by the people of this 
country. Probably very, very likely, 
today, we are seeing the first reaction 
to that at the polling places. I also ap-
preciate his talking about the increase 
in taxes, the negative effect to small 
businesses, and the regulations as well. 
It is concerning that the comment he 
made is quite true, because at this 
point, we have seen no text and it 
changes on a daily basis. Yet, we are 
going to be asked to vote for that 
thing, perhaps before we even get to 
see what is in it. Seems like I have 
heard that somewhere before. 
Anyway, let’s move on. We are ex-
cited to have the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) next to 
give us his thoughts on the mon-
strosity of a bill here and the tax and 
spending actions of the administration. 
Mr. MEUSER is the ranking member of 
the Small Business Subcommittee on 
Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Ac-
cess. I thank him for being here this 
evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Missouri, 
the Republican leader of the Small 
Business 
Committee, 
Mr. 
LUETKE-
MEYER. 
Madam Speaker, I am, as all of us 
are, I think, deeply concerned about

November 2, 2021 
the adverse impacts that the Demo-
crats’ budget reconciliation plan, as it 
is called, will have on our Nation’s 
small businesses. 
Today, small businesses are battling 
severe labor shortages, escalating en-
ergy costs, inflationary pressures, sup-
ply chain disruptions, and potential 
mandates that are causing uncertainty 
and threatening small businesses’ via-
bility. That is happening today. 
All Members of Congress should be 
focused on pro-growth policies to help 
empower small businesses, startups, 
and 
American 
entrepreneurs. 
We 
should be discussing a smart deregula-
tory 
environment 
that 
allows 
the 
smallest firms to operate independ-
ently. 
Instead, our Democrat colleagues are 
attempting to push through completely 
partisan legislation with trillions of 
dollars in reckless spending and over 
$420 billion, at least, in tax hikes on 
Main Street job creators. 
Small businesses need better and 
they deserve better. Approximately 
two-thirds of American jobs are cre-
ated by small businesses, so their 
strength is our Nation’s economic 
strength. President Biden continues to 
tell business owners, and all of us, that 
this bill is going to reduce inflation 
and create jobs. 
This reconciliation bill—by the way, 
that is reconciliation with a ‘‘W’’ be-
cause it will do the exact opposite. It 
will wreck our economy, unless some-
how the President and the Democrats 
have figured out how to defy basic eco-
nomic principles, which is pretty much 
like trying to defy gravity. 
You cannot disincentive work and 
create more workers. You can’t flood 
the economy with more dollars and 
drive down inflation. This just isn’t 
how it works. It is against the simple 
laws of cause and effect. 
Presently, we have a labor crisis that 
is at historic levels. How do new gov-
ernment programs that disincentivize 
work support millions of small busi-
ness owners who are struggling to fill 
open jobs? 
Has anyone ever met a single small 
business owner who believes raising 
their taxes will somehow help them 
build back better? The answer is a re-
sounding no. 
Most of us know this firsthand. I 
worked in small business for years. I 
hold regular business townhalls and 
talk with small businesses every day. 
We hold hearings where small busi-
nesses are saying the same thing. 
Higher taxes, pending mandates, ex-
panding the IRS—that will be a wel-
comed addition to their day—inflation, 
energy costs. I just got a text from a 
businessperson sending me a picture of 
over $4 a gallon gasoline and saying— 
well, I won’t repeat what he said. Prod-
uct shortages and labor shortages are 
smothering and perplexing American 
businesses. Small business owners are 
literally pulling their hair out. They 
are working harder and getting less for 
it. 
Small businesses are not asking us to 
spend billions on a civilian climate 
corps or more IRS agents or amnesty, 
but they are demanding that Congress 
not raise their taxes, not issue con-
fusing mandates, and that we won’t 
make it more difficult for them not to 
just prosper but to survive. 
It is time for the Democrats to halt 
this reckless tax-and-spend spree that 
does nothing but exacerbate the nu-
merous crises facing Americans today. 
Reconciliation is a bad bill, it has been 
an even worse process, and it is truly 
an insult to small businesses who are 
counting on us. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania for his insightful remarks, 
and I appreciate him quantifying that 
this is a $420 billion hit to small busi-
nesses. 
His comment about working harder 
and making less, we understand the 
pandemic caused a lot of dislocation, 
but we should be past that now. We 
should be helping businesses get back 
on their feet, not kicking their feet out 
from underneath them and adding to 
the uncertainty with additional rules 
and regulations. 
I am excited now to have one of the 
newest members of our conference, 
Congresswoman YOUNG KIM from Cali-
fornia, who is the ranking member of 
the Small Business Subcommittee on 
Innovation, 
Entrepreneurship, 
and 
Workforce Development. She herself 
has been a small businesswoman in the 
past, and I look forward to her insight-
ful remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER for yielding and arrang-
ing this very timely Special Order to 
discuss how taxes, increasing prices, 
and the reduced workforce pool are im-
pacting our Main Street USA, which is 
the true backbone of our economy. 
I represent California’s 39th Congres-
sional District, which lays in the tri- 
county area of Los Angeles, Orange, 
and San Bernardino Counties. I have 
the pleasure to represent one of the 
most diverse districts in the country 
that has a very vigorous entrepre-
neurial spirit. Unfortunately, it has 
been trampled down by unclear guide-
lines on lockdowns, increased red tape, 
labor shortages, high inflation, and, 
now, a supply chain crisis. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER knows very well 
that a big threat is looming in the ho-
rizon in the form of increased taxes and 
burdensome regulations through the 
partisan reconciliation process. 
Instead of working with us to tackle 
the issues impacting small business 
owners and workers, this administra-
tion and this House majority are look-
ing to add more fuel to the fire with 
fiscal expansionary measures at a time 
when economic analysts say that we 
could see inflation above 3 percent well 
into 2022. This is a run on inflation not 
seen since the early 1990s. 
In my home State of California, parts 
of the State recorded their highest av-
erage gas prices ever last Friday. Some 
places are recording close to $6 per gal-
lon. This is all taking place when some 
of our colleagues in the majority are 
calling for a total domestic ban on gas 
and oil production, which would unde-
niably increase prices for all goods and 
services. 
To add insult to injury, California re-
cently released its jobs report showing 
the highest unemployment rate in the 
Nation, 
and 
unemployment 
claims 
keep increasing. 
So let’s ask ourselves: Why is Cali-
fornia seeing an uptick in unemploy-
ment claims when NFIB is reporting 
over half of small businesses have job 
openings they cannot fill? Why is Cali-
fornia seeing a record number of job 
creators leaving to establish their busi-
nesses in other States? The answer is 
very simple. Many are tired of Sac-
ramento 
punishing 
entrepreneurial 
ventures through some of the highest 
taxes in the country and burdensome 
regulations. 
Let’s learn from the mistakes en-
acted in California and instead work to 
empower entrepreneurs, job creators, 
and Main Street. Let’s get back to the 
path of prosperity, where we are not 
punishing success, and we make it easi-
er for individuals and families to estab-
lish small businesses and serve the 
communities that we all love. 
I want to thank, again, Ranking 
Member LUETKEMEYER for his leader-
ship on our Small Business Committee 
and for being a fearless advocate for 
Main Street USA and entrepreneurs all 
across the country. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her remarks, and we cer-
tainly appreciate her comments. She 
made a comment with regards to entre-
preneurs. The small business folks are 
the entrepreneurs that make our coun-
try work. They are willing to take the 
risk and invest their own dollars, work 
long hours, and wind up being paid 
last, if at all sometimes. 
I am glad she pointed out the lesson 
that we should be learning from Cali-
fornia. A lot of times we look to Cali-
fornia to see what the latest trends 
are. Right now, the latest trend is who-
ever is the last one out, turn the lights 
off. So I think we need to be looking at 
that and listening to those citizens, 
those businesspeople, who are leaving 
the State due to the high cost of taxes 
and regulations, just to be able to work 
there. 
I am excited now to have another 
new member to our conference, who 
also is a member of the Small Business 
Committee, former State senator from 
the State of Wisconsin, Congressman 
SCOTT FITZGERALD. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
the biggest tax increase for small busi-
ness in over 50 years—let me say it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6109 
November 2, 2021 
again—the biggest tax increase for 
small business in over 50 years. This is 
what President Biden and my col-
leagues across the aisle are proposing 
in order to pay for part of their multi- 
trillion-dollar spending package. 
The President and the Democrats 
have proposed a range of options that 
will hurt economic growth and fall on 
the backs of small businesses, like rais-
ing the corporate tax, raising the indi-
vidual tax rates, taxing unrealized cap-
ital gains, and giving the IRS author-
ity to spy on Americans’ bank ac-
counts. 
In announcing the tax increases, the 
Biden administration said their agen-
da: ‘‘Will protect 97 percent of small 
business owners from tax increases, 
while delivering tax cuts to more than 
3.9 million entrepreneurs.’’ 
But here is the problem. It doesn’t 
add up. The statement doesn’t add up. 
It doesn’t hold up to the scrutiny. The 
reality is that approximately 1.4 mil-
lion small businesses are structured as 
C corporations, meaning that they will 
be subjected to the proposed 28 percent 
corporate tax rate, as opposed to the 
current rate of 21 percent. 
Let’s talk about S corps. If you are 
not familiar with the S corp or the 
LLC, an individual small business own-
er’s taxes flow through the S corp. So 
what is going to happen? They are 
going to increase the individual tax 
rate. What will that mean? S corps and 
LLCs will see an increase in the 
amount of taxes that they are paying. 
Add in, as my other colleagues have 
already brought up this evening on 
Special Orders, rising inflation rates, 
increased cost of goods and services, 
shipping delays, labor shortages, and 
these small businesses will find them-
selves in a hole. They are trying to 
jump start themselves right now out of 
a pandemic, and we are going to tax 
them more? It makes absolutely no 
sense. 
For nearly a decade, I was the owner 
of a small business. If you would have 
told me in 1990, when I started my 
small business, that I would be facing 
labor shortages, tax increases, and sup-
ply delays, guess what? I wouldn’t have 
started a small business. You would be 
out of your mind to start a small busi-
ness 
under 
those 
types 
of 
cir-
cumstances. 
And guess what? We are seeing that 
happen in my home State of Wisconsin. 
The restaurant industry, gyms, manu-
facturers, 
construction 
companies, 
they are all struggling right now. If 
you are back in the district and you 
are talking to people and you are at a 
chamber meeting or you are at some 
type of specific association related to 
an industry, they will continue to tell 
you we are in trouble. Yet, the Biden 
administration and the Democrats are 
looking at tax increases on these small 
businesses. 
We must give small businesses a 
chance to succeed. This trillion-dollar 
reconciliation package and the subse-
quent tax increases do just the oppo-
site. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle truly want to save small busi-
nesses, they will drop the spending 
plan, cut taxes for small businesses, re-
plenish the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund, and drop the arbitrary vaccine 
mandate. That is what would get em-
ployees back to work. 
These small-business owners deserve 
an opportunity to chase the American 
Dream. As it stands, this reconciliation 
package will take that opportunity 
away from them. 
b 1830 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I thank the 
gentleman for his comments and in-
sightful remarks. I really appreciate 
him pointing out something, that this 
is the biggest tax increase in 50 years 
on small businesses. Let me say that 
again, the biggest tax increase in 50 
years on small businesses. 
In our committee recently we had 
the Small Business Administration Di-
rector, and one of the members from 
our committee asked the Director if 
she had been advising the administra-
tion on the tax policy in this bill and 
had done any studies as to the effect of 
those taxes on small businesses? We 
couldn’t get a response. 
She said, well, it really wasn’t some-
thing she would be concerned about. 
Here is the Director of the Small Busi-
ness Administration, whose prime duty 
is to work this agency for the benefit 
of small businesses in this country, and 
she was not going to think that this 
bill was important enough with the 
taxes and other extraneous things in 
there to even think about working on 
it and advising the administration 
about what could happen to small busi-
nesses? 
There is a huge disconnect within 
this administration about what is 
going on in the real world and the uto-
pian view of how they would like to 
have things be in the future under a so-
cialist regime. This is nuts. 
How in the world can you put a bill 
together like this that has this kind of 
effect on small business and not even 
study the effect of it? Absolutely 
breathtaking. 
I yield to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW), a small busi-
ness person himself. He has experienced 
some of these hardships and problems, 
and he is going to tell us all about 
what his views are on this bill and how 
it can impact his business. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, as 
we rapidly approach the upcoming holi-
day season, which is the busiest time of 
year for many American families and 
for many industries, I am, we all are, 
greatly concerned about the state of 
our country. Gas prices are the highest 
we have seen in nearly a decade, forc-
ing families to contemplate if they can 
afford to travel for the holidays. 
Worse yet, those wishing to travel 
further are worried that their flights 
may be canceled at the last minute be-
cause there aren’t even enough pilots 
to fly the planes. 
Those who have saved their hard- 
earned money for months to buy their 
loved 
ones 
something 
special 
for 
Christmas worry that their delivery 
will be stuck at our backed-up ports. 
Make no mistake, all of these crises 
happening at once are not a coinci-
dence. They are the result of failed 
Biden administration policies and a re-
jection, a whole-out rejection of the 
longstanding values that always made 
our America great. Authoritarian vac-
cine mandates on many vital industries 
have led to labor shortages on a mas-
sive scale. 
Overtaxation on small businesses and 
their owners through an increase in the 
individual tax rate threaten more than 
130,000 jobs in an already struggling job 
market. Overbearing red tape in this 
socialist reconciliation bill threatens 
to raise penalties on businesses by over 
500 percent and will lead to more small 
businesses going bankrupt, something 
we have already seen far too much of 
over the last 2 years. 
This is not what America wants. We 
are already struggling to sustain a val-
uable and available workforce. Demo-
crats’ overregulation on our businesses 
and government handouts are leading 
to a cradle-to-grave welfare state, crip-
pling our country’s ability to recover 
from the pandemic and once again 
thrive as the strongest nation on 
Earth. And it is all coming to a head. 
It is all coming to a head this holiday 
season. 
We cannot continue to weaken Amer-
ican businesses. We cannot continue to 
weaken American supply chains. We 
cannot continue to weaken the Amer-
ican Dream. We cannot continue to 
weaken the greatest nation on the face 
of the Earth: America. We are the 
greatest country there has ever been 
and ever will be. Why is the left trying 
so hard, so desperately to destroy that 
greatness? 
We must get Americans back to 
work, and we must support policies 
that allow our businesses to flourish 
and not wither away. It is the basis of 
America. 
I will continue to fight alongside my 
colleagues to ensure that these bad, de-
structive policies and their decades- 
long consequences are prevented. We 
will continue to fight for good policy 
that opens our country back up, that 
gets our people back to work, that 
makes us strong and puts America 
back to the forefront of the world 
stage. 
Mr. 
LUETKEMEYER. 
I 
certainly 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
for his remarks and reminding us that 
inflation is a tax as well. I think we 
need to remember that when we go to 
the gas pump. Last January I was able 
to get it for $1.89. On Monday I filled up 
my tank and it was $3.19. I got nothing 
more. I got the same amount of gas. 
The only difference is it was $1 and 
some higher. Inflation is a tax. 
I appreciate him reminding us of the 
work ethic and values that our small 
business folks display and have to work

with every day to make their business 
work and the effects of mandates. I ap-
preciate his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER), who has a great personal story 
himself. I look forward to his remarks 
and his concerns about this mon-
strosity of a bill, socialist reconcili-
ation bill. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER 
for having this Special Order. At a 
time when we should be doing every-
thing we can to help small businesses 
thrive and strengthen America’s work-
force, President Biden’s radical social-
ist agenda is driving a wedge between 
job creators and the workforce. 
Drawing upon 25 years of experience 
in private industry, working in a fac-
tory, later managing that factory, I 
understand the challenges that our 
businesses face and what it means to 
get up every day, go to work, and sup-
port a family. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats aren’t looking out for American 
families. If they were, they would not 
be working to increase the tax rates for 
small business owners or dumping 
more than a trillion dollars into the 
economy. That will only worsen the in-
flation we have seen and the supply 
chain crisis. 
This build back better scheme is a 
farce. It is simply out of control. Who-
ever controls more of an individual’s 
money and how they earn it controls 
more of their actions. That should be 
the person who earns it, not the gov-
ernment. 
When you look at these tax policies, 
when you look at inflation, when you 
look at the fact that this administra-
tion has taken us away from energy 
independence, 
people 
are 
spending 
more for groceries, they are spending 
more for fuel, they are going to spend 
more to heat their homes, and that is 
controlling more of their money be-
cause of these poor policies. The best 
thing government can do is get out of 
the way and return economic independ-
ence to the American people. 
I thank the ranking member for hav-
ing this Special Order and allowing us 
to point out that we believe in the 
American people. They built the great-
est economy the world has ever seen. 
They built the greatest nation on the 
face of the Earth, and I just wish that 
President Biden, when he talks about 
being frustrated with American citi-
zens, would get half as frustrated with 
China and Russia and the Taliban. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I thank the 
gentleman for his insightful remarks. I 
really appreciate his comments. Pour-
ing more money into the economy just 
adds to inflation. If we go back and 
look at the comments by the CBO when 
they scored the bill back in February, 
a $1.9 trillion bill, they said we didn’t 
need it, that we would have 5 percent 
growth by the end of this year if we did 
nothing. And yet we spent $1.9 trillion 
and look at what has happened. We 
have runaway inflation going on right 
now, and we want more money to be 
spent again. This is nuts. 
Government control. I appreciate his 
comments with regard to that. This is 
about government control. It is about 
controlling the economy and control-
ling individuals and controlling busi-
nesses. Again, it is about the belief 
that the other side seems to believe in 
the goodness and greatness of govern-
ment, and we believe in the goodness 
and greatness of our people. I certainly 
appreciate his comments with regard 
to that and reminding us of those sa-
lient facts. 
Madam Speaker, how much time is 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 9 minutes. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Thank you 
very much. I shouldn’t be too long. We 
have rolled this around quite a bit, and 
we have hit on the high points, but I do 
want to make a few closing remarks. 
The American people deserve better 
than this. We are here to be able to 
help them, not to harm them. We are 
here to be able to lift them up and em-
power them instead of take power 
away. We are here to give them hope, 
not destroy hope. You do all these 
things on the positive side, I think, by 
empowering them and letting them be 
who they are rather than take that 
away from them and try from the gov-
ernment side to control what they are 
doing and who they want to be. 
I have the opportunity with one of 
the positions that I hold here in Con-
gress to meet with a lot of foreign fi-
nance ministers from around the world, 
and it is always interesting to talk to 
them because they are very jealous of 
what we have. We have something most 
countries in the world don’t have, and 
that is economic freedom. The freedom 
to be able to go somewhere tomorrow; 
if you want to change jobs, go change 
jobs. If you want to start a new busi-
ness tomorrow, go start a new business. 
If you want to start another one next 
week, start another new business next 
week. Most places in the world you 
can’t do that, and that is a huge dif-
ference. That economic freedom, that 
entrepreneurial spirit that we have in 
this country makes us different from 
everybody else. 
This monstrosity of a socialist rec-
onciliation bill is a dagger in the heart 
to the entrepreneurs and the small 
business people in this country who 
have built this country. The big busi-
nesses, where did they start from? 
They started as a small business. They 
didn’t start as a big, major business to 
begin with. They started in somebody’s 
garage or in a university research lab 
somewhere or as an idea that somebody 
scratches on the back of a napkin in a 
restaurant somewhere. These people, 
the entrepreneurs who are willing to 
put their ideas on the table, their 
money, and their beliefs and risk ev-
erything to make this work. 
This bill that we are talking about 
this evening is a dagger in the heart to 
those people who are willing to take 
those kinds of risks and drive our coun-
try forward and provide the jobs. 
As a reminder, when we unleashed 
the power of the people with the tax 
cut bill of 2017, we wound up before the 
pandemic of having 1.2 million more 
jobs in this country than we had people 
to fill them. The first time in history 
that we had those sorts of job openings 
for people to apply for. 
The fundamentals are still there if 
we don’t destroy them, and that is the 
key. This bill will destroy those fun-
damentals. Add to that the uncertainty 
that a lot of our good friends and small 
businesses that drive this country are 
concerned about, the taxes will be the 
burden that will have to be overcome, 
and probably will drive a lot of them 
out of business. 
They are very concerned about the 
direction of this administration. They 
seem to believe, again, in the goodness 
and greatness of government. Our side 
believes in the goodness and greatness 
of our people, and we want to empower 
them and continue to protect them and 
work with them. 
Madam Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity to be here this evening and 
for allowing us to have this Special 
Order. I yield back the balance of my 
time.

INVESTING IN THE UNITED 
STATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
we are here tonight to talk about these 
amazing bills coming up having to do 
with our investment in the United 
States of America, both in the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill and the Build 
Back Better Act. 
These two bills taken together will 
create millions of American jobs re-
building our infrastructure and build-
ing clean energy technology to combat 
climate change. Together, the Build 
Back Better Act and the infrastructure 
package are expected to create 2 mil-
lion jobs a year on average. They will 
reward work by cutting taxes for work-
ing families and lowering costs on the 
things that keep folks up late at night, 
like healthcare, childcare, and home 
care for aging relatives.

We are going to pay for that invest-
ment and those investments in our Na-
tion and in working families by mak-
ing sure that the ultra-wealthy and the 
corporations pay their fair share. 
The Build Back Better Act will not 
add to the deficit, and no one making 
less than $400,000 a year will pay a 
penny more in taxes. That is the prom-
ise that President Joe Biden made, and 
we intend to keep it. 
Now, Madam Speaker, we have here 
Representative BRIAN HIGGINS of Buf-
falo. He is a ninth-term Member from 
western New York, and prior to serving 
in Congress, Representative HIGGINS 
was a history and economics instructor 
at SUNY Buffalo State College. Rep-
resentative HIGGINS also served in local 
and State elected office. Congressman 
HIGGINS has been a fierce advocate of 
stronger regional and national eco-
nomic policies. 
Congressman 
HIGGINS
currently 
serves on the Ways and Means and 
Budget Committees. Congressman HIG-
GINS is also the Democratic chair of the 
House Northern Border Caucus. Con-
gressman HIGGINS is the chair of the 
House Cancer Caucus, and he is a 
House 
lead 
on 
the 
Canada-United 
States Inter-Parliamentary Group. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
I was listening intently to the other 
side extolling the virtues of nothing 
but a cynical assessment of the Amer-
ican economy when the American econ-
omy, in fact, needs investment. 
A couple of facts I want to clear up 
here, if the United States economy had 
grown at the increased rates seen 
under Democrats since 1933, the aver-
age income of Americans would be 
more than double than it currently is 
today. 
Economic growth since 1933: 4.6 per-
cent under Democrats; 2.4 percent 
under Republicans. 
Annual jobs increases since 1933: 
Under Democrats, 2.8 percent; under 
Republicans, 1 percent. 
Since 1962, Democrats created 21 mil-
lion more jobs than Republicans. 
Ten of 11 of the United States reces-
sions between 1953 and 2000 began under 
Republicans administrations. 
George Bush I, a Republican, created 
a $300-billion deficit. William Clinton, 
a Democrat, wiped out the entire def-
icit and left the next administration, 
Bush II, with a $300-billion surplus. 
Bush II turned that into a $1.3-trillion 
deficit. Obama, a Democratic Presi-
dent, cut that deficit to $600 billion. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I have been listening to our colleagues 
across the aisle complaining about so- 
called socialist tax increases that we 
have in store. 
Does the gentleman know what the 
top marginal tax rate under the Eisen-
hower administration was? 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I yield to the 
gentleman from New York. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. That 
would be 91 percent. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Ninety-one per-
cent under the Republican Eisenhower 
administration during the 1950s. 
And what happened to that 91 per-
cent, if the gentleman knows? 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. It was re-
duced to 77 percent under a Democratic 
administration, under John F. Ken-
nedy. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. We are talking 
about the top marginal tax rate, which 
is in the 30s right now. Am I correct in 
that? 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. That is 
right, sir. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. You can con-
tinue. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Well, I 
think the point that is being made here 
is, despite perceptions to the contrary 
and the assertions of those who have 
now left perhaps because they can’t de-
fend this, clearly the American econ-
omy performs much more efficiently, 
much more effectively under Demo-
cratic administrations. 
That is why the Build Back Better 
program invests not in wars that don’t 
create any new roads and bridges in 
America, that don’t pull any kids out 
of poverty, that don’t provide childcare 
and child tax credits. Complete waste 
of money. Brown University just came 
out with a study that said Americans 
paid $6.2 trillion in the past two dec-
ades in three Middle East wars. 
The Build Back Better program in-
vests in America by rebuilding Amer-
ica, by investing in young America so 
that they become safer, have better nu-
trition, and have more economic activ-
ity at a very young age. 
Every single study points to the 
same conclusion, that if you invest in 
kids, the child tax credit, pre-K, 
childcare, you produce a more produc-
tive citizen. University studies show 
that for every dollar that you spend, 
you produce in long-term economic 
benefits $7 to $8. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I want to talk about a few things. I 
want to talk about jobs, tax cuts, and 
lower costs for American families. 
First, 
jobs. 
Together, 
under 
the 
Biden administration, we have already 
created nearly 5 million jobs this year. 
Growth is up. Wages are up. And unem-
ployment right now is down below 5 
percent. 
Together with Build Back Better, the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill will cre-
ate millions more jobs, good-paying 
jobs, American jobs, union jobs, jobs 
that cannot be outsourced, cannot be 
offshored. 
This infrastructure package makes 
the largest Federal investment in pub-
lic transit ever. It is the largest Fed-
eral investment in passenger rail since 
the creation of Amtrak. 
In Pennsylvania alone, the State will 
be opened up to over 3 million people 
with access to Amtrak. In northeastern 
Pennsylvania, Amtrak has assessed 
that adding a line to reach north-
eastern Pennsylvania will add $87 mil-
lion a year in additional economic ac-
tivity in Pennsylvania. 
These are amazing, smart invest-
ments, investments that we have to 
make in our country if we expect to 
compete with Europe, with China, with 
Russian, places that are investing in 
their infrastructure. 
We are talking about the largest in-
vestment in clean drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure in American 
history. This is how we avoid catas-
trophes like what happened in Flint, 
Michigan, where little kids got brain 
damage 
from 
drinking 
lead-tainted 
water from pipes that hadn’t been re-
placed in over 100 years. 
This infrastructure investment will 
ensure that every American has access 
to reliable high-speed internet. This is 
the kind of investment that the Fed-
eral Government knows how to make. 
This is the kind of effort that we have 
succeeded at before because we have 
seen it. 
Eighty years ago, it was the Rural 
Electrification 
Act, 
which 
brought 
electricity to places in America that 
did not have it and would not have it 
today 
if 
the 
government 
hadn’t 
brought that into effect. The Rural 
Electrification Act did essentially the 
same thing with electricity that we in-
tend to do with broadband internet ac-
cess. 
We can’t leave people behind. That is 
what we do if we continue on the same 
path we are on. 
This infrastructure bill helps us 
tackle, maybe most importantly, the 
climate crisis by making the largest 
investment in clean energy trans-
mission and electric vehicle infrastruc-
ture in history. Build Back Better will 
work with the infrastructure package 
to make even more investments in 
electric vehicles and other clean en-
ergy technology to combat climate 
change while making our economy 
more competitive. 
Rebuilding our infrastructure means 
rebuilding our middle class. It means 
jobs, jobs, jobs, and more jobs. 
Before I move on to tax cuts, I would 
like to recognize a fellow Member from 
Pennsylvania, Congresswoman MARY 
GAY SCANLON. MARY GAY SCANLON is a 
second-term 
Member 
representing 
Pennsylvania’s 
Fifth 
Congressional 
District. In Congress, Representative 
SCANLON has continued her work as a 
lifelong advocate for children and fami-
lies. 
Representative 
SCANLON
currently 
serves on the House Judiciary Com-
mittee and the House Rules Com-
mittee. She is vice chair of the House 
Committee on House Administration. 
Congresswoman SCANLON
and her 
husband, Mark, have three adult chil-
dren. 
They 
currently 
reside 
in 
Swarthmore with a lot of pets. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
SCANLON).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6112 
November 2, 2021 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman CARTWRIGHT
for 
yielding, and I thank him for outlining 
some of the many benefits to climate 
in this bill because for my adult chil-
dren and so many of the college stu-
dents in my district, their number one 
issue is finally taking meaningful ac-
tion to address climate change. 
But these bills do so much more than 
that. After more than 50 years of failed 
trickle-down economics and unfulfilled 
promises to prioritize our Nation’s in-
frastructure, the last administration 
decided to punt on infrastructure and 
double down on giveaways to the rich 
by passing yet another tax cut for the 
ultra-wealthy. What did that get us? 
Widening income inequality, a shrink-
ing middle class, crumbling roads and 
bridges, and increased corporate wel-
fare. 
For too long, America’s economic 
policy has revolved around support for 
the rich and powerful rather than 
working people. With President Biden, 
we are ready to change that. 
I am proud to be part of a Congress 
that is prioritizing the American peo-
ple. 
In partnership with the Biden admin-
istration, Democrats in Congress have 
set out to offer the greatest potential 
for American families and American 
small businesses to achieve prosperity 
and the American Dream in half a cen-
tury. We need both the bipartisan In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
and the Build Back Better Act to meet 
that potential and deliver a fairer, 
more balanced economy that works for 
all Americans. 
After too many infrastructure weeks 
to count, Congress will soon deliver an 
infrastructure bill to the President’s 
desk that creates economic oppor-
tunity for all Americans in the 21st 
century and beyond. 
My district, Pennsylvania’s Fifth, is 
home to Philadelphia’s airport, port, 
and rail yard; miles and miles of inter-
state highways and passenger rail 
lines; 
and 
regional 
commuter 
and 
light-rail lines that link Philadelphia 
and its suburbs. Our infrastructure is 
aging, heavily used, and, in many 
cases, beyond its usable lifespan. Any-
one who has been stuck in traffic or a 
pothole on the Schuylkill Expressway, 
the Blue Route, or I–95 knows how im-
portant an infrastructure bill is to our 
region. 
State and local governments in Penn-
sylvania and across the country simply 
don’t have enough money to meet basic 
maintenance needs, much less to invest 
in modernization, expansion, or other 
improvements to our national infra-
structure. That is precisely why the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
is so critical for my district and our 
national economy. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will fix our ailing roads and 
bridges and fund improvements to 
other critical infrastructure at our 
port and airport. These upgrades are 
essential to maintain our region’s posi-
tion as a logistics hub on the East 
Coast and to ensure America’s com-
petitiveness in a global economy. 
America 
can’t 
engage 
in 
inter-
national trade if it can’t get goods in 
and out of the country or across the 
country due to crumbling infrastruc-
ture and related backlogs in proc-
essing. 
b 1900 
The COVID pandemic brought into 
sharp focus how essential the internet 
is for Americans to work or find em-
ployment, to participate in remote 
learning, to access healthcare, to stay 
connected with friends and family, and 
to carry out any number of basic ac-
tivities in the 21st century. Yet, mil-
lions of Americans live in areas where 
there is no broadband infrastructure, 
or they can’t afford it. 
Our infrastructure bill will expand 
broadband access for millions of Amer-
icans, including many of my constitu-
ents. 
In 
addition 
to 
investing 
in 
broadband infrastructure, the bill will 
also lower prices for internet service 
and create a permanent program to 
help more low-income households ac-
cess the internet. 
Much like the Federal Government’s 
efforts to provide electricity to every 
American nearly a 100 years ago, this 
effort will be transformative. It will 
drastically improve the ability for all 
Americans, no matter where they live 
or their income level, to access serv-
ices and opportunities that are essen-
tial to modern life. 
Another aspect of the infrastructure 
bill that is important for my district is 
the funding it provides for climate re-
siliency, particularly flooding. Commu-
nities like Eastwick, and economic en-
gines like the Philadelphia airport, are 
especially 
vulnerable 
to 
climate 
change. We have seen the damage done 
by flooding, hurricanes, and even—as-
tonishingly, in southeastern Pennsyl-
vania—tornadoes. 
Sadly, these extreme weather events 
are only getting worse. Funding from 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act will make our communities safer 
and our infrastructure more resilient 
to the impacts of climate change. 
But fixing our Nation’s physical in-
frastructure can only take us so far. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill cre-
ates jobs that will provide new oppor-
tunities and reduce costs for many 
Americans, but it won’t change the cal-
culus for the working mom or dad who 
can’t find adequate childcare for their 
kid. It won’t improve our schools or 
prepare for the future, and it won’t re-
duce the spiraling cost of prescription 
drugs. 
All of these factors are holding back 
families from fully participating in our 
economy, and in turn, preventing them 
from buying homes and building wealth 
for retirement. Without addressing the 
failings of our ‘‘human infrastructure,’’ 
a majority of Americans—particularly 
women and people of color—will con-
tinue to be held back. That is why we 
need universal pre-K, better access to 
affordable childcare, a dependable sys-
tem of care for our seniors, and invest-
ments in higher education and work-
force training. 
The Build Back Better Act will lower 
the cost of things that keep families up 
at night, while also delivering a mas-
sive tax cut for the middle class 
through the expanded child tax credit 
and the earned income tax credit—giv-
ing the middle class more breathing 
room. That is what my constituents 
need. 
Already this year, through the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan that we passed in 
March, we have seen the child tax cred-
it benefit 126,000 children in my district 
alone. That is 76,000 families who got 
extra help for essentials like childcare, 
food, and diapers—much less paying for 
school clothes, extracurricular sports, 
or putting something aside for college. 
By making the most significant in-
vestment in children and caregiving in 
generations, we are helping individual 
families and the country as a whole. 
Because people—particularly women— 
can get back to work when they know 
that their family members are cared 
for. And ensuring access to quality 
daycare and preschool sets children up 
for success, making them more likely 
to graduate, pursue higher education, 
hold jobs, pay taxes, and have higher 
earnings. 
In addition to increasing the max-
imum for Pell grant awards, the Build 
Back Better Act expands opportunities 
for Americans to participate in job 
training programs that prepare them 
for careers in fast-growing sectors. 
This bill is going to help the working 
people in PA–05 and across the country. 
It will help families like the one I 
met in Media—a mom who was beam-
ing about her son’s good-paying, new 
job at the Philadelphia shipyard, which 
he got after completing the Maritime 
Career Development Program at Dela-
ware County Community College. It 
will help low-income workers in my 
district who work two or more jobs 
every day but still can’t make ends 
meet. 
It will help families that struggle to 
pay for the prescription drugs that 
keep them alive without forcing them 
to choose between forgoing medication 
or housing or heat or food. And the 
best part, the Build Back Better bill is 
paid for by making those at the top 
pay their fair share for a change. 
Madam Speaker, 17 Noble Prize-win-
ning economists recently wrote in sup-
port of this legislation, ‘‘Because this 
agenda invests in long-term economic 
capacity and will enhance the ability 
of more Americans to participate pro-
ductively in the economy, it will ease 
longer-term inflationary pressures.’’ 
We have the chance to set a new path 
that creates real, sustained economic 
growth and benefits everyone, not just 
multimillionaires and real estate de-
velopers. It is time to get this done for 
the American people. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6113 
November 2, 2021 
I appreciate that you mentioned pot-
holes, and you don’t have to be from 
Pennsylvania 
to 
understand 
the 
scourge of potholes. I will say that in 
my hometown of Scranton, there was a 
study done about how much it costs car 
owners every year to play the pothole 
slalom every year and hope that you 
don’t damage your car. They do dam-
age their cars, and it costs on average 
$1,400 a year for car owners to drive 
over these rough roads. 
It is something that only the govern-
ment can do, fix the roads, pave the 
roads, fix the bridges. Thank you for 
mentioning that. 
In fact, I would be remiss if I did not 
mention, the Susquehanna River flows 
through 
northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
and it bisects the two towns of Pittston 
and West Pittston. And there are only 
two bridges over the Susquehanna at 
Pittston to West Pittston, and one of 
them is out right now. It is out because 
it is really old; it hasn’t been main-
tained properly because the money 
wasn’t there, the investment wasn’t 
made, and we didn’t get the job done. 
This is exactly why we have to make 
these investments. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her time this evening. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
have heard of other States that have 
that problem. I heard Kentucky has a 
bridge that is out right now that is des-
perately in need of repair. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I want to go back on the question of in-
frastructure for a moment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. HIGGINS), 
our colleague from Buffalo. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
two 
colleagues 
from 
Pennsylvania were very clear about the 
component parts of this plan and the 
good things that they do for individ-
uals, but they also do good things for 
our Nation as a whole. 
Madam Speaker, the conservative 
economist from Moody’s Analytics, 
Mark Zandi, did an analysis of the 2017 
corporate tax cut. He said that for 
every dollar that you gave away, you 
could expect to recapture 32 cents. 
That is a loss in investment of 67 per-
cent. 
On infrastructure, the conservative 
economist says that for every dollar 
that you spend on infrastructure, you 
produce $1.60 in economic activity. The 
gain on investment on infrastructure is 
60 percent. So it is beyond the bricks 
and mortar of infrastructure. It is also 
the good that that does for the growth 
in the economy. 
I would leave you with this: The oil 
age isn’t going to end because we run 
out of oil. The oil age is going to end 
because we find a better way than the 
internal combustible engine, some-
thing that is quieter, cleaner, and 
eventually cheaper. And guess what? 
This bill, the Build Back Better, the in-
frastructure bill, has money to provide 
charging stations to facilitate the 
making and the using of electric vehi-
cles, ending this Nation’s addiction to 
foreign oil. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. HIGGINS), for his time here this 
evening. 
Madam Speaker, we have talked 
about creating jobs, and Build Back 
Better is about creating jobs. It is also 
about helping workers keep more of 
their hard-earned paychecks by cutting 
taxes for the middle class. Thanks to 
the American Rescue Plan, the child 
tax credit’s monthly tax cuts are al-
ready helping parents put gas in the 
car or pay for childcare so they can go 
to work and help fuel our economy. 
The latest data analyzed by the JEC 
found that these tax cuts are gener-
ating more than $19 billion in spending 
in 
local 
economies 
each 
month 
throughout our Nation. The data are 
clear: When working families keep 
more of their hard-earned money, that 
is more money pumping into local 
businesses and supporting even more 
jobs. That is why we are working to 
continue those tax cuts and more 
through the Build Back Better Act. 
Democrats passed the child tax credit 
and the American Rescue Plan without 
a single Republican vote. That is right. 
Every single Republican voted against 
more money in the pockets of hard-
working families. 
Now, it is Democrats who are work-
ing to extend the child tax credit. This 
contrast could not be clearer. When 
Democrats control the Congress, we 
cut taxes for working people. When Re-
publicans control the Congress, they 
cut taxes for millionaires and billion-
aires and corporations. And they leave 
middle-class families out to dry. 
Madam Speaker, we are joined to-
night by an esteemed colleague, Rep-
resentative PAUL TONKO of the Capital 
District of New York. He is a six-term 
Member of Congress from Upstate New 
York and a lifelong public servant. 
Throughout his career, he has been a 
strong fighter for the environment and 
sustainable energy, and he currently 
serves as the cochair for the Sustain-
able Energy and Environmental Coali-
tion Caucus and a member of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. 
Representative TONKO
is a long-
standing champion for the working 
class by advancing policies that create 
jobs, provide economic opportunity, 
and ensure that senior citizens are able 
to retire with dignity. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
CARTWRIGHT), and thank him for lead-
ing us in tonight’s discussion on both 
physical and human infrastructure. 
Let me start by extending my com-
ments toward the child tax credit that 
you made mention of in your last com-
ments. The data now are available 
from July and August. As we all know, 
families received their first check in 
July, and what a bit of welcome relief. 
And as we look at where those dollars 
went, 47 percent, from July and August 
payments—those are the data available 
currently—47 percent went to put food 
on the table; 28 percent went toward 
utilities, including broadband. 
So we are talking about kids doing 
their homework. We are talking about 
parents having an opportunity to reach 
the 
outside 
world. 
Middle-income 
America to have cottage industries up 
and running. So 75 percent of that tax 
cut went to food and utilities, and 
other incidentals absorb the remaining 
amount of payments. Now, that is a 
staggering statistic. That should tell 
us something about the value added of 
this tax cut. 
Madam Speaker, as Representative 
CARTWRIGHT indicated, there is a stark 
contrast between Republican leader-
ship in the House and Democratic lead-
ership in the House. When the majority 
was run by the Republicans, they 
joined the former President in pro-
viding a tax cut for the 1 percent of the 
highest wealth in the country. This 
reaches across the spectrum of middle- 
income communities and those looking 
to ascend to the middle class. 
The statistic that I find most heart-
warming is that one-half of children 
living in poverty in our country, one- 
half of those children, will be lifted out 
of poverty with this child tax credit. 
That is a moral standard that we 
should all embrace. 
If you want to really see a comeback 
in our economy, we support those fami-
lies, 
middle-income 
families, 
those 
looking to ascend to the middle in-
come. Those are the families that need 
the shot in the arm. And it is going to 
happen by further extending that tax 
program. 
So our heart is with children. Our 
heart is with those children who need 
early education, three- and four-year- 
olds that will be able to have advan-
tages, too. The programs that will pro-
vide, not only educational training, but 
cognitive skill development, cognitive 
awareness, social awareness that will 
drive the factors that lead to a produc-
tive life. 
b 1915 
And so many times education experts 
will cite the availability of early edu-
cation as the big factor in determining 
the outcome of a person’s work career 
and the dollars that individual brings 
home; so that is very important. 
Access to quality childcare. So many 
families are not rejoining the work-
force because they don’t have access to 
healthcare. And if the schools are in 
this undecided state whether they are 
going to have virtually learning or in- 
classroom learning or part of each 
combined, they need the security of 
childcare. 
So the human fabric, the human in-
frastructure that is part of the Build 
Back Better Act introduced and envi-
sioned by this President, President 
Biden, is tremendously reinforcing to 
so many families across the country. 
Powerful information and powerful re-
inforcements that enable them to

dream their version of the American 
dream. 
Now, when we talk about the phys-
ical infrastructure, I would be remiss if 
I didn’t equate that to the 20th Con-
gressional District of New York. My 
district hosts the eastern mouth of the 
Erie Canal. And the vision for infra-
structure in really difficult economic 
times, by Governor DeWitt Clinton, 
was to connect the great ocean, the At-
lantic, with the Great Lakes. 
That inspired not only the develop-
ment of New York as an entry port, 
and we now know what a metropolis it 
is, but it inspired the necklace of com-
munities that were given birth to as 
mill towns; and then inspired a west-
ward movement. That is infrastructure 
playing into our economic development 
into our future. It expanded the turf of 
this country. It gave so many people 
the opportunity to insert their skill 
set, their passion, their abilities into 
products that fed the quality of life 
around the world. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I request a colloquy with the gen-
tleman from New York. 
Is the gentleman trained as an engi-
neer? 
Mr. TONKO. Yes. Not a civil engi-
neer, but mechanical and industrial. 
But those engineers are powerful be-
cause they make the world spin. And 
that whole feat, today, if you were to 
visit the Erie Canal and see the lochs 
that were developed at a time when 
modern 
equipment 
and 
machinery 
wasn’t available, it was not only an en-
gineering feat, but a tremendous salute 
to the workers and the skill and the 
work ethic that they bore. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman was discussing the neck-
lace of communities that followed the 
Erie Canal. Earlier on this evening I 
was talking about how Amtrak as-
sessed that restoring passenger rail in 
northeastern Pennsylvania would re-
sult in about $87 million per year of ad-
ditional economic activity along the 
line. 
Mr. TONKO. Absolutely. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Does that hold 
water? 
Mr. TONKO. Absolutely. And as we 
invest in rail, we increase ridership if 
you are getting from A to B in a 
quicker time period than you would if 
you were traveling by car. It makes 
common sense and economic sense. 
From rail to broadband—I have com-
munities in my district that are 
unserved 
or 
underserved 
with 
broadband services. 
Today, this is about doctors reading 
x-rays, children doing their homework, 
cottage industries launching and stay-
ing in business. This is an important 
bit of modern-day infrastructure. It is 
akin to the Rural Electrification Act of 
the 1930s, in the last century. 
We have a history that speaks to us 
boldly 
about 
what 
infrastructure 
meant. The Rural Electrification Act 
made America buzz with economic ac-
tivity; provided economic justice by 
reaching every corner of this country, 
which broadband will do. 
Let me just mention this, and I will 
close with this for now. I chair the 
Subcommittee on Environment and 
Climate Change reporting to the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. Under 
our umbrella falls the responsibility 
for the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
The drinking water infrastructure in 
this Build Back Better effort, and in-
frastructure in general, is about mak-
ing certain no children drink out of 
lead-infested pipes. 10,000 pipes in this 
country that are feeding and serving 
homes. There is no way children and 
families should be drinking water that 
has lead in it: we know that it is a per-
manent damage, irreversible; and we 
know that it is about social and eco-
nomic justice. 
We also provide for more dollars in 
the SRF, the State Revolving Funds, 
which 50 capitals across the country re-
ceive in terms of the Federal downpay-
ment for water infrastructure. I was in 
county government back when I start-
ed my career, and we had much more of 
a partnership with Washington. 
Today, we are getting on average 
maybe 4 to 5 percent of all projects 
that are drinking water-based as a Fed-
eral share. Come on, we can do much 
better than that. If we don’t, the issue 
doesn’t go away, and local property 
taxpayers have to pick up that burden. 
It is a regressive tax. 
So for many, many reasons, we are 
on board here with a plan that really 
speaks to the definitive times in which 
we reside. We now are living in a mo-
ment of history where we need to re-
engage, reengineer our skill sets, our 
resources, to advance an innovation 
economy; and to do that, we need a 21st 
century toolkit and the Build Back 
Better Act and the infrastructure act, 
they do it. It is a good downpayment. 
We are going to still have more work 
to do. 
The President has a vision; it is bold. 
But we know that leaders in the past, 
Governor DeWitt Clinton, President Ei-
senhower, 
President 
Franklin 
Roo-
sevelt, President Teddy Roosevelt with 
parks, setting aside lands for park de-
velopment, these were giants in their 
times. 
We have a giant now calling on Con-
gress to help bring the vision into clear 
view and tether it into the commu-
nities across this country. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. It is true, isn’t 
it, that the Build Back Better Act and 
the bricks and mortar infrastructure 
act, they work together, they dovetail 
to achieve the visions you are talking 
about? 
Mr. TONKO. Worker training, worker 
retraining, apprenticeship programs, 
skills development, childcare, so that 
families can comfortably go to work 
and know that their children are in 
good stead. We have many households 
that are headed by single-parent moms. 
We have many households that have 
both members of the household, cou-
ples, having full-time jobs. 
It is a different economy. These are 
different times. We need to adjust. We 
need to invest in America and into her 
people, and that is what this measure 
is about. 
I am also involved with the offshore 
wind industry. And making certain 
that my district, hundreds of miles 
away from any offshore wind project, is 
going to have many jobs because we 
are going to be building foundations. 
We are going to be building tower com-
ponents. We are going to be building 
the ancillary pieces that are a part of 
it. We may be building some of the tur-
bine blades that are then installed in 
the offshore capacity along the eastern 
network where everyone is going to 
prosper from this. And we are going to 
clean the environment, which is a de-
mand of the generations behind us and 
those yet to be born. 
They have the right to demand clean 
air; to have made clean the air they 
breathe; and make safe the water they 
drink. It is a mission that is justified, 
and we need to be part of that justifica-
tion. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Representative TONKO. We have 
an engineer on his toes here this 
evening who has picked up on a lot of 
the points that have been made pre-
viously. 
For example, Representative MARY 
GAY
SCANLON
and 
Representative 
TONKO both brought up the similarity 
between expanding broadband internet 
access to all of the rural places and all 
the nooks and crannies and hollers in 
this country. The similarity between 
doing that and enacting the Rural 
Electrification Act 80 years ago by 
President Franklin Roosevelt, if we 
hadn’t done that so many people would 
have been left behind, literally, in the 
dark. 
If we don’t do this, we are going to 
leave Americans behind in the quest 
for knowledge and keeping up in the 
modern economy by use of high-speed 
broadband internet. 
Another thing Representative TONKO 
just mentioned, Madam Speaker, is 
about filling jobs. I represent north-
eastern Pennsylvania, and I talk to 
employers a lot, employers of manufac-
turing jobs, employers of retail and 
restaurant jobs, and the lament has 
been constant. With manufacturing 
jobs, it predated the pandemic, it was 
that we can’t find people trained-up to 
do our work. We can’t find people who 
know how to run CNC machines, the 
modern version of the lathe, to manu-
facture parts in their businesses. 
The Build Back Better Act includes a 
lot of money for workforce develop-
ment. It is a big favor being done for 
employers, for companies that do man-
ufacturing work; but it goes beyond 
that. As Representative TONKO
just 
mentioned, there are so many families, 
single-parent families, where either the 
mom or the dad, probably predomi-
nantly the mom, is home watching 
kids and doesn’t have options for 
childcare or for pre-K that would en-
able them to go out and go back to

November 2, 2021 
work. That is what we are seeing right 
now after the pandemic. 
In fact, we have Wilkes-Barre, Penn-
sylvania, in my district, and the chief 
executive officer of the Greater Wilkes- 
Barre Chamber of Commerce did a sur-
vey and touched on the very point Rep-
resentative TONKO just made. The sur-
vey showed that of the people who took 
themselves out of the workforce be-
cause of the pandemic, in restaurant 
and retail jobs, of those people, 54 per-
cent of those who have not gone back 
have not gone back because they are 
watching kids at home because of the 
scarcity of options for childcare. 
Remember, when you are working in 
a restaurant or retail, if you are bus-
sing tables, you are not making enough 
money to hire a nanny. You are not 
making enough money to get the top 
option in daycare. That is why the 
Build Back Better Act comes in handy. 
What it does is—above all, remember 
this—it does a favor for those small 
businesses, those employers that are 
trying to fill those jobs that are open 
and are going begging for people to 
come fill them. The Build Back Better 
plan, by establishing universal pre-K 
and also beefing up childcare options, 
gives those parents the ability to go 
back to work and fill those jobs and 
power our economy. 
What do you think, Representative 
TONKO? 
Mr. TONKO. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I yield to the 
gentleman from New York. 
Mr. TONKO. Representative CART-
WRIGHT
mentioned, Madam Speaker, 
the strength of manufacturing and 
growing our manufacturing jobs. The 
pandemic alerted us to a supply chain 
crisis. The Build Back Better Act 
speaks to addressing the shortages that 
we had for manufacturing. Supply 
shortages. That is critical. 
We also combined the efforts for 
manufacturing to be more profitable 
and provide more jobs by addressing 
retrofitting manufacturing, so it is en-
ergy-smarter as an outcome. 
Now, we know we have a very robust 
plan, a goal that is very robust by the 
year 2050 to have net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions. If we are going to 
achieve that, we have to reach to every 
sector of the economy in order to at-
tain those goals; so we need to look to 
manufacturing. 
Retrofitting manufacturing, making 
certain it is energy-smart, making cer-
tain it can compete in a global market-
place with all the tools at their finger-
tips is an important standard that is 
established in the Build Back Better 
Act. 
So the President says we are at an 
inflection point. I couldn’t agree more. 
We are now in a focus mode where we 
are going to determine the best out-
comes by combining legislation and re-
sources that will speak to the most 
forceful, sharpest competitive edge for 
our business community, for our manu-
facturing base to address our supply 
chain, to hold down energy costs, re-
duce costs, reduce the tax burden on 
households, and provide a vision that 
will get us to where we need to be. 
It is about time that we had this sort 
of leadership; not just reducing pro-
grams, cutting down government, not 
seeing the effectiveness of sound gov-
ernment. Now we have a leader who un-
derstands the public-private partner-
ship—business working with govern-
ment—to address the needs of those 
businesses, 
their 
workers, 
worker 
training, and having the resources to 
be robustly competitive so that we 
grow a more fair, more just, more ro-
bust, and a more sustainable economy. 
It is a powerful opportunity. 
b 1930 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Representative TONKO. The 
gentleman 
has 
repeated 
the 
word 
‘‘competitive’’ about three times just 
now, and I couldn’t think of a more ap-
propriate word because, Madam Speak-
er, it is a tough world out there. We 
Americans may think the world owes 
us a living, but it doesn’t. We have to 
get out there and compete. Our busi-
nesses have to compete, and our people 
have to compete. 
We have to be at the top of our game 
to win and keep those jobs and make 
sure they don’t go to Europe or Russia 
or China. Those countries are investing 
in themselves. They are building fast 
railroads; they are building their roads 
and bridges; and they are investing in 
high-speed 
internet—all 
of 
these 
things. As a result, we had better be at 
the top of our game. 
That is what we do with the Build 
Back Better Act and these infrastruc-
ture investments. 
Now, I have talked about jobs and 
tax cuts, but cutting costs for Amer-
ican families has to be covered as well. 
As Representative TONKO mentioned, 
this bill will save most families more 
than half their spending on childcare 
and deliver free pre-K for every 3- and 
4-year-old in America, as we talked 
about. That will free up moms and dads 
to go to work. It will also provide 
money for senior care. 
There are a lot of folks at home who 
can’t leave the house because they are 
taking care of an elder at home. That 
is another thing that these bills help. 
Just think about what it means to a 
working family in northeastern Penn-
sylvania or anywhere else in this coun-
try that they can be freed up to go 
back to work and fill jobs that are 
going begging right now. It means par-
ents can go to work and fuel our econ-
omy knowing their kids or their elder-
ly parents are taken care of. That is 
good for our entire economy. 
Now, we know that eldercare and 
childcare isn’t the only thing keeping 
parents up late at night. It is about 
making ends meet and making sure 
they can afford good healthcare cov-
erage. These bills beef up the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act to 
the point where we almost have uni-
versal healthcare in this country. That 
is so good because it keeps our hos-
pitals afloat. 
Madam Speaker, do you know what 
happened in Pennsylvania before we 
got the expansion of Medicaid under 
the Affordable Care Act? We started 
losing rural hospitals. Madam Speaker, 
it is no longer a theoretical thing. 
When your hospital isn’t there because 
it went under, your actual healthcare 
suffered, 
not 
your 
coverage. 
Your 
chances of making it if you had a heart 
attack or a stroke go way, way down if 
the local hospitals are not financially 
sound and robust. 
This will lower healthcare costs by 
strengthening the Affordable Care Act. 
It is a very important part of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, maybe the most im-
portant thing that people miss about 
these bills that we are working on 
right now: The Build Back Better Act 
is paid for. It is fully paid for by mak-
ing sure that the ultra-wealthy and 
corporations pay their fair share. It 
will not add to the deficit, and no one 
making less than $400,000 a year will 
pay a penny more in taxes. In fact, 
working families are going to see their 
taxes cut because Build Back Better re-
wards work and not wealth. 
This contrast is worth repeating, 
Madam Speaker. When Democrats con-
trol the Congress, we cut taxes for 
working people. When Republicans do, 
they cut taxes for millionaires and cor-
porations. No more. 
As the President often says, for far 
too long, this economy has worked 
great for those at the top while hard-
working Americans who built this 
country have been cut out of the deal. 
Democrats are dealing working people 
back into the deal by building an econ-
omy that gives them a fair shot. We 
are going to make sure it is paid for by 
asking the ultra-wealthy to pay their 
fair share. It is only right. 
Madam Speaker, it is so important 
that we pass these bills. Representative 
TONKO
has spent some considerable 
time talking about the importance of 
rebuilding, maintaining, and expanding 
our bricks-and-mortar infrastructure. 
That is so important. These are assets 
that were passed down to us from the 
Greatest Generation. 
Who are we to think that we don’t 
have to maintain them, take care of 
them, expand them, make them better, 
and make them work for a modern 
economy and all the needs that Amer-
ican workers and businesses have to 
stay competitive in the world? 
I say let’s pass these bills, let’s get 
the job done, and let’s fulfill the vision 
for the American workers, the Amer-
ican people, and our entire Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I will 
also cite the fact that some of the 
greatest looking institutional build-
ings in our districts are from the FDR 
era: libraries that speak significantly 
to the cityscapes, institutional set-
tings, schools that really laid out an

image of importance to children of how 
great education is. We have been 
taught by generations before us that 
there should be a commitment to peo-
ple across this country, especially chil-
dren, to invest in our tomorrows. 
How dare we just pass by and cut ev-
erything and not help build? 
We are hurting ourselves by not in-
vesting in those resources that will get 
us to a stronger economy, research 
money that will be part of the $555 bil-
lion that is part of the investment in 
climate change, the response to cli-
mate change. It is much stronger than 
that, but there in the Build Back Bet-
ter Act is the opportunity to advance 
that effort. 
Now, that will include a number of 
jobs in the trades, installing a lot of 
the renewable energy and innovative 
concepts, retrofitting manufacturing 
and the like. But then there are going 
to be the white collar jobs as engineers 
and planners go to work on investing 
in the newness of discovery. That will 
come with many people working in labs 
and research centers who will get us to 
a stronger outcome. 
Where there is no vision, the people 
shall perish. We learn that when we 
open our Book. That should speak to 
us. It is important for us to have a 
boldness of vision that will take an in-
vestment but certainly render lucra-
tive dividends for the people in this 
moment and those generations that 
will follow us. 
Let them look 100 years from now at 
this moment and say they got it; they 
invested; they received great assets 
from those before them; and they saw 
that they had to do likewise and con-
tribute to the tomorrows that that 
group will enjoy 100 years out and be-
yond. 
This is our moment to really shine. 
The gentleman talked about the fact 
that this effort is paid for. That is a 
good balance that we bring into the 
House. We tell people that we balanced 
it so that there is a payment mecha-
nism for all that we choose to do. That 
was not the case with the huge tax cut 
of 2016. They expected a trickle-down 
and that it would pay for itself. 
What did we see happening to the def-
icit? It bloated from that tax cut. 
Then, Madam Speaker, you will hear 
debate on this floor about raising the 
debt ceiling so that America can pay 
her bills. What was their message? 
They want this money so they can 
spend more. 
No, we are paying the dollars off that 
you incurred as bills when you were 
President and you were the Republican 
leadership in this House. That is pay-
ing for bills that came from the last 
several years. This payment mecha-
nism will make certain we go forward 
with an investment in America that is 
paid for and that will reach the great 
many of us, the great middle-income 
community. 
The strength of America lies in her 
middle class, and the strength of the 
middle class lies in union jobs, which is 
part of this package. Thanks to our 
partners in unionized labor, union 
labor, they have worked with us to de-
velop a blueprint for a sounder tomor-
row. 
Let’s get aboard. Let’s get this done. 
Let’s go forward and show people that 
America is strong and that she is at 
her best when she embraces that pio-
neer spirit that I saw when I mentioned 
the Erie Canal. There has always been 
that pioneer spirit within us. It is part 
of our DNA. 
How dare we deny it as we come to-
gether in this crucial moment where 
we are asked to come up with a re-
sponse to a global economy, where it is 
not the U.S. running the entire econ-
omy of the world, where we have to 
compete and compete effectively, and 
where we give the people of this coun-
try the dignity of work where they can 
earn a great and fair check so they can 
support their families, pay for the roof 
over their head, set some money aside, 
and enable their children to enjoy that 
future set-aside? 
That is what this is about. This is 
speaking to America, her families, and 
those in need. It will result in a strong-
er and healthier workforce and one 
that has a sense of hope. If we can de-
liver the commodity of hope to the 
doorsteps of Americans, we will have 
achieved. 
So, Madam Speaker, I thank Presi-
dent Biden; I thank the leadership in 
the House; and I thank Representative 
CARTWRIGHT for leading us this evening 
in this great discussion. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman TONKO for his 
comments. 
Madam Speaker, you can tell when 
you get Congressman TONKO, a guy 
from Amsterdam, New York, revved up 
about the Erie Canal, he is going to 
give you a good speech. A good speech 
is what we need to be doing right now 
because we have to have people under-
stand the importance of passing the in-
frastructure bill and the Build Back 
Better Act, and passing them together 
because they fulfill the vision not only 
of President Biden but a vision that we 
have all been waiting for for the long-
est time. 
Representative TONKO
and I have 
been serving our entire time in Con-
gress—for me, 9 years; for the gen-
tleman, 13 years—waiting for infra-
structure to happen. 
Representative MARY GAY SCANLON 
spoke earlier tonight about all the in-
frastructure weeks we had under the 
past administration. We had infra-
structure week after infrastructure 
week. She said that as a joke because 
it never happened. We just labeled 
weeks ‘‘infrastructure week,’’ and no-
body did anything about it under the 
Republican administration. 
We are here to say President Biden 
and the current Democratic majority 
in the House are going to deliver for 
the people on the vision of infrastruc-
ture and making our economy and our 
American people competitive on the 
world stage. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
HONORING AMERICA’S BELOVED 
VETERANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
BERGMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud and honored to host today’s 
Special Order in light of Veterans Day 
being just around the corner on No-
vember 11. 
Here in D.C. and back home in Michi-
gan, I stay closely connected with all 
my fellow veterans, and I can tell you 
this: From the Afghanistan debacle to 
lingering backlogs at the VA, it has 
not been an easy year for veterans and 
their families. 
But I want to remind you all, vet-
erans, you are not alone. We are here 
with you; we are listening; and we are 
working through the difficult times to 
get things done. You are going to hear 
today from many of my colleagues who 
not only share this feeling but want to 
remind you that we are working every 
day on your behalf, not for any polit-
ical reason but because we strive to 
thank you and honor you for your serv-
ice to our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), who is 
my friend, colleague, and fellow ma-
rine. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. General 
BERGMAN is doing a great job. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to join 
my friends and fellow veterans here 
today to honor the generations of men 
and women who have served this great 
Nation. From the Greatest Generation 
of veterans to the youngest generation 
of veterans, we are undeniably lucky to 
have men and women who are willing 
to lay down their lives for others. 
This Veterans Day comes exactly 2 
months after the 20th anniversary of 
the 9/11 terror attacks. 
b 1945 
In that sense, it is an even more 
poignant reminder than usual of the 
sacrifices veterans have made so that 
we can be free. For 20 years, soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, marines, guardsmen, 
reservists, and Special Forces units, in 
and around Afghanistan prevented an-
other terrorist attack on the home-
land. For 20 years, they made the world 
safer. For 20 years, they gave the Af-
ghanistan people a taste of freedom; 
the freedom for Afghan women and 
girls to pursue education and a career; 
the freedom to play sports, the freedom 
to be Christian; the freedom to live 
without oppression and terror. 
Like generations of veterans before 
them, they spent days, months, and 
years thousands of miles from home. 
They missed births, birthdays, wed-
dings, funerals, anniversaries and holi-
days. They protected those they will

never meet. They looked our enemies 
dead in the eye and refused to accept 
defeat. 
As a veteran, a father, and a grand-
father of Active Duty servicemembers, 
and the lead Republican on the House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I could 
not be prouder of the millions of men 
and women who selflessly answered our 
country’s call throughout our history. 
This Veterans Day, I encourage all 
Americans to pause and remember 
those who have defended our way of 
life. Their service should always, al-
ways be honored and celebrated. We 
owe them a debt of gratitude that can 
never be repaid. 
Last, and certainly not least, I want 
to share a message for those who may 
be struggling. If you are a veteran or 
you know someone who is a veteran 
who is going through a tough time, 
please reach out and ask for help. It is 
the right and brave thing to do. Your 
service mattered. You matter. The Vet-
erans Crisis Line offers free, confiden-
tial support to all veterans. Simply 
call 1–800–273–8255 and press 1. Once 
again, that is: 1–800–273–8255 and press 
1. Or you can text, 838255. Once again,

May God bless our veterans, their 
families, and the United States of 
America. I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. BOST for his comments, and 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BABIN), my friend and colleague 
and fellow Air Force veteran. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
General BERGMAN for having this very 
worthy Special Order tonight on vet-
erans. On the eleventh hour of the elev-
enth day of the eleventh month, patri-
ots will come together to celebrate 
America’s brave protectors, past and 
present. 
As a son of a World War II veteran, a 
veteran myself, and the father of a 
decorated Navy SEAL, it is sometimes 
very difficult for me to adequately ex-
press the deep-rooted gratitude that I 
hold for our military; the same grati-
tude historically held by a majority of 
our great country. 
This year, however, something is dif-
ferent. The people of this Nation still 
honor our servicemen and -women, but 
unfortunately, 
some 
in 
the 
White 
House don’t seem to do that. This ad-
ministration would rather focus on our 
military being woke rather than being 
prepared and ready for a potential war 
with our enemies. 
My heart especially goes out to our 
veterans of Afghanistan. The Biden ad-
ministration and our military leader-
ship failed you and the Afghan allies 
that you worked so closely with for 
decades. To the men and women of our 
Armed Forces who sacrificed so much 
over the last 20 years, I say this: Hold 
your head up high. Your service pro-
tected countless freedom-loving people 
and prevented terrorism from thriving 
in the United States and in our post-9/ 
11 world. 
Ronald Reagan once said: ‘‘Freedom 
is never more than one generation 
away from extinction. We didn’t pass it 
onto our children in the bloodstream. 
It must be fought for, protected, and 
handed on for them to do the same.’’ 
No one understands this truth more 
than our vets. I promise to continue 
using my position in Congress to serve 
those who have served us and to all of 
our current and former soldiers, sail-
ors, airmen, marines, guardians, and 
coasties, I gratefully and humbly say 
thank you. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
great men and women who serve and 
have fought in our military and risked 
their lives to protect this great coun-
try of ours. 
Each November, we are reminded of 
the heroism our veterans displayed 
both at home and abroad. My Congres-
sional District, Pennsylvania’s 16th 
Congressional District, is among the 
largest constituencies of military vet-
erans in our Commonwealth. More 
than 45,000 veterans call PA–16 home. 
That is 1 in 15 of my constituents, and 
it would be hard to go to any home 
anywhere in the district that I serve 
and not find people who have served in 
the military. 
Our office has a dedicated veterans’ 
outreach program. Some of our rep-
resentatives—right now it is Francis 
‘‘Chookie’’ LaCamera; 36 years he 
served. We also had John ‘‘P.K.’’ 
Galanski, a Vietnam vet who never 
stopped serving. After he came home, 
he has been part of our service out-
reach program and has dedicated his 
entire life to taking care of our vet-
erans. 
Also, a good friend and a guy who has 
done such a great job, Tony ‘‘Gunny’’ 
Digiacomo, another Iraqi war veteran 
who served in our office taking care of 
our veterans and now is a Crawford 
County VSO. 
And last, but not least, John Cuneo, 
who is an Afghani war veteran. When I 
talked to John about the Afghanistan 
withdrawal, I said: John, I just want to 
make sure you are okay. And he said: 
Mike, I haven’t slept for 5 days. I lost 
friends in Afghanistan. I held them as 
they died. Some of them came back 
home, but they were deeply wounded 
and injured and probably will never 
fully recover. And I just don’t under-
stand how we arrived at this type of a 
withdrawal. 
I keep thinking to myself: Was it 
worth it? The loss of lives, the loss of 
limbs; was it really worth it? 
All I can say to him is: John, for 20 
years our men and women in uniform 
have kept the home country safe. I 
don’t know what more you could have 
done. I, too, have the sense of what 
your loss is and how deep it is. But 
please just remember that the Amer-
ican people will always be indebted to 
you for what you have done. And we 
know how difficult these last few 
months have been. 
We look back at what happened in 
Afghanistan and our withdraw from Af-
ghanistan and I keep wondering, why? 
Why, this true 1 percent of Americans 
go and serve? How can they look at 
what is happening and think things are 
all right? 
That is why this month, this Novem-
ber, this Veterans Day, it is absolutely 
critical that we take time out of our 
daily lives and anybody we know that 
served, we thank them for their serv-
ice. We thank them for their sacrifice. 
We thank them for everything they 
have done for this great country. 
I ask people to please remember: 
When they left to go serve us and to 
protect us, some of them never came 
home; never got a chance to celebrate 
another Thanksgiving; never got a 
chance to celebrate a Christmas. Most 
never had a chance to get married, 
have children, and enjoy the American 
life. 
They did it because they love this 
Nation. They gave everything they 
could possibly give. And there is a say-
ing out there that all gave some, but 
some gave all. That is so true and that 
is why on November 11 every single 
American should stop and say a prayer 
for those who not only lost their lives 
but those who came home injured, and 
some injured in a way that they will 
never be able to have the life they had 
before they left. 
They are entitled to everything they 
have been promised, and, more impor-
tantly, they deserve it. They deserve 
that. 
So on this date, November 11, let’s all 
stop just for a minute and think just 
how much this country, this Nation 
meant to those who served. I thank the 
gentleman so much for having the Spe-
cial Order. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), my 
friend. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Michigan for holding this Special Order 
tonight and for his service to our Na-
tion as a general in the United States 
Marine Corps. 
As Veterans Day approaches this 
year, we should all take time to recog-
nize and honor the men and women in 
uniform who served our Nation in Iraq 
and in Afghanistan. Two of our col-
leagues, Representative BRIAN
MAST 
from Florida and Representative DAN 
CRENSHAW from Texas served in Af-
ghanistan and now serve their country 
in the United States Capitol as our col-
leagues. 
Please know that your commitment 
and your sacrifices were not in vain. 
Over the past two decades, our Nation 
has been more safe and more secure be-
cause of your vigilance and because of 
your service. In November, we also rec-
ognize National Veterans and Military 
Families Month. During this month 
and every month, we must be com-
mitted to providing the services that

all of our veterans need. Please know 
that if you or a loved one is struggling, 
there is help and there are resources 
that are available through the Vet-
erans Administration. 
Congress must always remain com-
mitted to supporting our veterans, and 
I am proud to be supporting legislation 
to ensure that the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs returns to full staffing 
levels to handle the backlog of requests 
that have been created by the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
This Veterans Day I ask all of us to 
renew our commitment to the men and 
women who have served our Nation. I 
ask that we ensure that they have the 
care and the resources that they need. 
I want to take special note to thank 
my wife, Alice, who served in the 
United States Navy for more than 12 
years; and her sister Julia Shocker who 
served in the United States Army. 
I want to thank the general from 
Michigan for holding this Special Order 
that allows us to recognize the impor-
tance of our freedom, our freedom that 
was given to us by the veterans who 
served our country. General, semper fi. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, and I accept that 
for all the veterans who served, espe-
cially the marines. 
Now, it is my honor to yield to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
ROUZER), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Michigan for 
yielding. 
With Veterans Day just around the 
corner, I am pleased to join my col-
leagues to honor the brave men and 
women who valiantly answered the call 
of duty to serve and protect the United 
States. 
In North Carolina, we have a rich 
tradition of military service, and we 
are blessed to have a large community 
of veterans in the Seventh Congres-
sional District. It is because of their 
selflessness 
and 
heroism 
that 
the 
United States remains free and con-
tinues to be the greatest light for lib-
erty mankind has ever known. 
Their families have devoted just as 
much to this noble cause. Over the past 
year and a half many of our citizens 
across this great land have struggled 
with the impacts of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, but none have been more af-
fected than our veterans and their fam-
ilies. 
Those veterans who have seen the 
horrors of war carry scars. Some are 
physical scars; others are emotional 
scars. Mental health has always been a 
need for many, given what they have 
been through. The botched withdrawal 
from Afghanistan has further exacer-
bated that mental anguish for so many 
who have served. 
This is why now, more than ever, it is 
important that Congress pay tribute to 
our country’s servicemembers and our 
veterans. It is also important for them 
to know that America supports them. 
To every veteran across this great land 
and their loved ones, we thank you and 
we are forever indebted to you. It is my 
honor to serve as a voice for North 
Carolina veterans in Congress, and I 
will continue to support vital measures 
to honor, provide support, and deliver 
results for our Nation’s heroes. May 
God always bless them. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GOHMERT), my friend and Army vet-
eran. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
certainly appreciate my friend General 
Bergman for using this time to pay 
tribute to veterans. I have seen the sta-
tistics from an article in 2018, 71 per-
cent of young Americans between 17 
and 24 are ineligible to serve in the 
military; 24 million out of 34 million 
people in that age group. The demo-
graphics of the military as of 2018 indi-
cate that there is just under 1.29 mil-
lion people serving, men and women 
serving in the military. That is less 
than 0.5 percent of the U.S. population. 
We owe our military the deepest 
amount of appreciation and thanks. 
And I just went back to the office this 
afternoon and got another plea from 
another servicemember. These people 
are the very tiny, few volunteers will-
ing to step up and defend America at 
all costs, including their own lives. 
b 2000 
Jesus said that is the greatest love 
there can be. They love their country. 
They love those they serve with. They 
are willing to face anything, except 
corrupt, high-ranking officers who are 
so busy sticking their heads up the 
atriums of the White House that they 
are not concerned enough about their 
own men. 
We saw that in the exit of Afghani-
stan. We saw servicemembers die be-
cause commanding officers didn’t care 
enough about their own troops. 
This notice says: You either take the 
vaccination—without regard to wheth-
er you have had bad reactions to things 
in there, like the warnings say—we 
want to experiment on you like we did 
the Tuskegee Airmen. This is wrong, 
and we should be standing up for our 
servicemembers, not only saying thank 
you, but thank you and you shouldn’t 
have to serve and follow orders that 
are experiments that we have outlawed 
such experimentation on our service-
members. 
Thank you, we owe you a debt of 
gratitude, and we are going to be fight-
ing for you here. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. 
WALBERG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with Veterans Day approaching, I am 
pleased to join my good friend from 
Michigan, General JACK BERGMAN, and 
all of my colleagues tonight in paying 
tribute to those who served. What we 
say tonight will be totally inadequate 
to express what needs to be expressed, 
but we must say it anyway. 
Veterans Day is a moment to pause 
and say thank you to the men and 
women who chose to defend American’s 
freedoms and the families who sup-
ported them from home. We have an 
obligation to display our deepest grati-
tude and make sure we care for the 
physical and mental health of those 
who served. 
In Congress, we have advanced a 
number of bipartisan initiatives. Last 
year, the Veterans Mental Health Care 
Improvement Act was signed into law 
to help ensure no veteran slips through 
the cracks. More support will be avail-
able through the Veterans’ Compensa-
tion Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, 
which helps veterans and their families 
keep up with ever-increasing inflation. 
These laws, and many others like 
them, are important steps forward, 
taken by a grateful Nation. But the 
work must carry on so that we con-
tinue to keep our promises to those 
who have heroically served. 
That is why this week I will be intro-
ducing a bipartisan piece of legislation, 
Prisoner of War Priority Care Act, that 
will assign the highest priority status 
for hospital care and medical services 
provided through the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to veterans who are 
former prisoners of war. 
For the wounds both seen and un-
seen, we owe an eternal debt of grati-
tude to our veterans. We say it with 
profound sincerity. We can’t make up 
for the cost, but we can support, as the 
days go by. 
Today, just like every day, we thank 
you. 
God bless our Nation’s veterans. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Michigan 
for hosting this Special Order and 
thank him for his distinguished service 
in the United States Marine Corps. 
America’s military is the most pow-
erful fighting force on the planet, and 
it draws its strength from the deter-
mination and might of its members, 
the men and women who have answered 
freedom’s call. 
This Veterans Day, we recognize the 
many sacrifices our veterans have 
made in order to defend our way of life 
and secure the blessings of liberty for 
all to enjoy. 
From the dawn of our Nation, valiant 
Americans have risen to confront every 
threat we face. For generations, Amer-
ica’s veterans have served our country 
with honor, beating back tyranny to 
the ends of the Earth. 
We also recognize America’s military 
families: the wives, husbands, children, 
parents, and siblings who share in their 
sacrifice. 
We are fighting for them in Congress, 
pushing for policies like the RECORDS 
Act, which would expedite requests for 
the records our veterans need so they 
can access the benefits they have 
earned. 
A grateful Nation salutes your serv-
ice. May God bless our veterans and 
the United States of America.

November 2, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. TIFFANY), my friend and border 
colleague. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
so 
much 
Representative 
BERGMAN for yielding. It is a great 
pleasure to be a neighbor to the won-
derful Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
Veterans Day has been celebrated 
under different names since World War 
I, but the premise remains the same: 
We pause to honor the men and women 
who have selflessly served our Nation 
and have kept us free. 
We honor their love of country, their 
patriotism, and their willingness to 
sacrifice for our greater good. Our 
country has faced many challenges in 
the last 100-plus years. From Belleau 
Woods to Normandy to the global war 
on terror, every time, our warriors 
have answered the Nation’s calls. 
This year, as we close the chapter on 
Afghanistan, we are again reminded of 
the sacrifices they have made, the 
kindness in their hearts, and their 
dedication to the mission. 
This Veterans Day, reflect on the gift 
they have given us, respect their serv-
ice, and thank them for their sacrifice. 
Because of them, we live in the great-
est Nation on Earth. 
On behalf of my constituents, thank 
you, and may God bless all of you. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CLYDE), my friend and colleague 
and Navy veteran. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, it was 
indeed the eleventh hour of the elev-
enth day of the eleventh month in the 
year 1918. World War I, the war to end 
all wars, was finally over. It was called 
Armistice Day. Today, it is called Vet-
erans Day, and it is the day we honor 
the service and sacrifice of all vet-
erans, those living and those who have 
gone before us. 
This coming Veterans Day is not 
about having another day off work. It 
is not about enjoying another Federal 
holiday where we have an opportunity 
to uncover the grill. It is about hon-
oring those who have served our coun-
try and sacrificed so we can live in 
freedom in the greatest Nation on the 
Earth. 
Madam Speaker, I grew up in Canada. 
My mom was Canadian and my father 
was a U.S. citizen and a U.S. Navy offi-
cer in the Korean war. In Canada, we 
didn’t call November 11th Veterans 
Day, we called it Remembrance Day; 
and we always wore a red poppy to re-
mind everyone of the sacrifices made 
for freedom. 
This is a picture of one right here. 
The poem ‘‘In Flanders Fields’’ from 
World War I talks about those poppies. 
As an elementary school student, I was 
required to memorize that poem. I 
think 
everyone 
should 
know 
that 
poem, because it is so powerful. The 
symbol of the poppy for remembrance, 
however, did not come from Canada. It 
came from my home State of Georgia, 
from a professor at the University of 
Georgia named Moina Michael. 
In fact, the highway between Athens, 
Georgia, and Monroe, Georgia, is called 
the Moina Michael Highway to honor 
her efforts. In 1917, she took a leave of 
absence from the university to volun-
teer with the Young Women’s Christian 
Association to assist overseas workers 
in the war effort. 
In November of 1918, inspired by the 
poem ‘‘In Flanders Fields’’ by John 
McCrae, she vowed to always wear a 
poppy as a remembrance of those who 
sacrificed in the war. 
In Flanders fields the poppies blow 
Between the crosses, row on row, 
That mark our place; and in the sky, 
The larks, still bravely singing, fly 
Scarce heard amid the guns below. 
We are the dead. Short days ago 
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, 
Loved and were loved, and now we lie, 
In Flanders fields. 
Take up our quarrel with the foe: 
To you from failing hands we throw 
The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
If ye break faith with us who die 
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow 
In Flanders fields. 
We are so blessed to live in a country 
where men and women willingly put 
their lives on the line for our liberty. 
We must not, we cannot break faith. 
As we celebrate Veterans Day 2021, 
let’s honor their service and remember 
their sacrifice by asking one simple 
question: How can we carry the burden 
for liberty? 
May God bless America and may God 
bless our military. 
Soli Deo gloria. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, during my 40 years in uniform, 
and now here in Congress, and also 
even before uniform, being raised in a 
family of World War II veterans, I feel 
as though because of my parents’ guid-
ance and example, I have dedicated my 
life to our military community, in one 
form or another. 
Through all of that and all I have 
learned, there is one thing about Vet-
erans Day that I really want to make 
sure that I talk about; all of you, talk 
to a veteran. Don’t just say ‘‘Thank 
you for your service,’’ but engage 
them, find out about their story. 
Veterans, to you, share your stories, 
because we don’t know how many more 
days that we might have to walk the 
face of the Earth. It is so important for 
us to share our stories as veterans with 
the next generations. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
We live in the greatest country in the 
world because men and women have 
sworn an oath to give their lives for 
our country. Never forget that. That is 
what makes us the United States of 
America. 
May God continue to bless our 
troops, all of our veterans and their 
families. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN H. 
JOHNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. 
DAVIS) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
come to the floor this evening for this 
Special Order, because I come to pay 
tribute to an iconic American, John H. 
Johnson, the founder of the Johnson 
Publishing Company, the founder of 
Ebony magazine, Jet magazine, Fash-
ion Fair, three radio stations that he 
owned, a television station, and lots of 
other business interests and ventures. 
Growing up in southeast Arkansas 
during the 1950s and coming into con-
tact with a Jet magazine or an Ebony 
that one of the schoolteachers may 
have in his or her possession or one of 
the ministers may have brought to 
town from wherever they came or the 
hairdresser may have had one or two, 
that was an exciting thing for a young 
African-American boy in the rural 
South. 
Little did I know that the man re-
sponsible for those products had grown 
up just a few miles away, or at least 
until he was in the ninth grade, John 
H. Johnson, Arkansas City, Arkansas. 
Close to McGehee; Dermott; Lake Vil-
lage; Eudora; Greenville, Mississippi, 
all of those little towns. 
Of course, John H. Johnson was fond 
of being a storyteller. He used to tell 
the story of how his mother had told 
him: Johnny, when you finish the 
eighth grade, we are going to move to 
Chicago so that you can go to high 
school. 
Then when he finished the eighth 
grade, she told him: Johnny, I didn’t 
save enough money for us to move, so 
you are going to have to go to the 
eighth grade again. And he told her: 
No, mom. That is all right. I will just 
go to work and help you save money. 
And she said: Nope, you are going to 
the eighth grade again. 
b 2015 
And so as bright as he must have 
been and as bright as he was, he had to 
do the eighth grade twice. Of course, 
eventually they did move to Chicago. 
He did go to high school. As a matter 
of fact, he went to high school with 
Redd Foxx and with Nat King Cole, and 
Mr. Abernathy, who owned and built a 
taxi company. He even went to school 
with Professor Timuel Black, who just 
died a few weeks ago. Tim was 102. He 
released his last book 2 years ago when 
he was 100. 
And so John H. Johnson did go to 
high school at Phillips and DuSable, 
became president of his class, of course 
editor of the yearbook, editor of the 
school newspaper, and he was then of-
fered a scholarship to the University of 
Chicago. 
Well, he wasn’t sure that he could go

have enough money, even with the

work for him. So he was then able to 
make use of his scholarship and go to 
school. 
After working for Supreme for 2 
years, he actually became the presi-
dent’s assistant because he was so in-
dustrious and so bright and all of ev-
erything that he was. 
Then he decided he would go into 
business for himself, and so he man-
aged to borrow $500 or make use of $500 
that his mother let him have or use, 
and he started his publishing business, 
a little magazine. He developed it and 
got so good at it until he did another 
one. 
He developed the Ebony magazine; he 
developed the Jet magazine; and at the 
height he had 2,300,000 subscribers. He 
was zipping and zooming. 
Part of what propelled him was the 
fact that in 1955 when Emmett Till was 
mutilated, murdered, and killed, he 
published the gruesome photographs of 
Emmett Till, and many people pro-
claimed that that really jump-started 
in a serious way the modern day civil 
rights movement because as people saw 
the gruesomeness of the murder of Em-
mett Till, they became motivated, en-
gaged, involved. 
It was the era that produced Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, John Lewis, civil 
rights icons. 
But at the same time that Mr. John-
son was publishing his magazines, he 
was really projecting the positivity of 
African Americans, showing Blacks 
who were superstars, promoting the 
idea. 
The fact that he had to come to Chi-
cago to high school was not really any-
thing unusual. Many towns in the rural 
South at that time did not have high 
schools for African Americans. As a 
matter of fact, many of them didn’t 
have any schools at all. Julius Rosen-
wald and Booker Washington teamed 
up and got with people in communities, 
and they built 5,000 schools. They are 
called the Rosenwald schools. As a 
matter of fact, our iconic colleague 
John Lewis attended one of those. John 
went to a Rosenwald school. 
But John Johnson continued to de-
velop his business and became so good 
at it; and he was a great storyteller 
himself. He didn’t work as a journalist. 
He worked as a businessman. But he 
had stories that he could tell. 
I was so amazed to get to meet him 
and know him and live in the area 
where his cousin lived, who introduced 
me to him. I remember we were in a 
group, an organization, and somebody 
said we needed to raise $500 for some-
thing, and somebody said, well, why 
don’t we ask Johnny Johnson for it? 
And his cousin, Miss Willie Miles 
Burns, who was the head of the sub-
scription department and worked for 
him, held up her hand, and she said, 
Johnny Johnson, who is that? The fel-
low said, Oh, you know, the guy down 
there at Ebony. And Miss Burns said, 
Oh, you mean Mr. John H. Johnson? He 
ain’t no Johnny Johnson. He is Mr. 
John H. Johnson. She said, He is my 
relative, and I call him mister every 
time I call his name. 
Well, obviously Mr. John H. Johnson 
continued to develop his businesses and 
ended up on the Forbes 400 as one of 
the wealthiest 400 people in the United 
States of America. He received every 
accolade, every honor, every possi-
bility of people acknowledging what he 
could do and what he had done. 
He used to tell a story about building 
a building, owning a building on Michi-
gan Avenue, and he couldn’t purchase 
it because the people who owned it 
wouldn’t sell it to him. So he got a 
friend of his to purchase it for him. 
Even to this day, the legend in Chicago 
is that he has the only building on 
Michigan Avenue that has a driveway 
where you can drive in off the street 
and go through the building. 
Notwithstanding any and all of that, 
John H. Johnson was a very common 
man. You could walk up to him and 
talk with him. He went down every day 
and picked up his newspaper and had a 
conversation with the person who sold 
the newspaper. 
Of course, he ended up with all kinds 
of honorary doctorates, degrees from 
Harvard University, the University of 
Arkansas. 
I was thrilled and delighted to go 
down to Arkansas City with him when 
they decided to move the home that he 
had lived in from where it was located 
and moved it downtown to make a mu-
seum out of it. It was a two-room 
house, but it’s called a shotgun house. 
Shotgun just meant you could open the 
front door and open the back door, and 
you could look all the way through, 
out into the back. Well, they moved 
the house from its location down to 
near the courthouse in Arkansas City, 
and that is where it currently is lo-
cated. 
Of course, Mr. JOHNSON was given the 
Medal of Freedom by President Clin-
ton. He was Man of the Year from the 
national Chamber of Commerce, the 
Spingarn Medal from the NAACP, all of 
this but still being a regular kind of 
person. 
Of course, the Congressional Black 
Caucus honored him. How could we 
not? He was obviously an icon who 
demonstrated that it really wasn’t so 
much where you came from as much as 
it was where you were going. It didn’t 
really matter what didn’t exist. It was 
what you created. And he obviously 
was one of the most creative individ-
uals. He had a book publishing com-
pany that Lerone Bennett wrote ‘‘Be-
fore the Mayflower’’ and published it. 
After all was said and done, John H. 
Johnson was an unusual man, an out-
standing man that the poet may have 
been thinking of when he suggested 
that: 
If you can keep your head when all about 
you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt 
you, 
But make allowances for their doubting, too; 
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, 
Or, being lied about . . . or being hated . . . 
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too 
wise. 
If you can dream—and not make dreams 
your master; 
If you can think—and not make thoughts 
your aim, 
If you can meet with triumph and disaster 
And treat those two impostors just the same 
. . . ‘’ 
Well, John H. Johnson, a man who 
will always be a historic figure, who 
gave so much to America. Two years 
ago the Arkansas General Assembly de-
cided to make November 1 a State holi-
day, honoring a native son, as Novem-
ber 1, 1945, was the date John H. John-
son launched Ebony and thats the ideal 
date to celebrate his legacy. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. JOHN-
SON for what he meant not just for Ar-
kansas but what he meant for America. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 
WITH CHINA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak a little bit about the 
current state of affairs with respect to 
our relationship with China and our 
Nation’s response to it. I do so at a 
time when I am yet again sitting in an 
empty House Chamber, as I often am 
when I am speaking here because we 
don’t really have debate here on the 
floor of the House, even when it is on 
important topics. 
We had votes today, for example, on 
12 of what we call suspension bills. To-
morrow, we are likely to have votes on 
another, I don’t know, five or six sus-
pension bills while we wait with bated 
breath as to whether or not our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
will produce the ever-waited-for legis-
lation to further cripple our economy, 
spiral us into massive amounts of debt, 
raise inflation, pay people not to work, 
disrupt the supply chain. We are all 
waiting around while my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are literally 
fighting over which horrible bill they 
can unleash upon the American people. 
It is really quite extraordinary if you 
think about it. The people’s House, we 
are sitting here debating, oh, well, are 
we going to have a $11⁄2 trillion disas-
trous bill or a $3 trillion disastrous 
bill? Are we going to play games and 
cut that $3 trillion bill in half by cut-
ting the time in half with the same dis-
astrous policies? But that is precisely 
what my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are doing. 
Meanwhile, China is preparing to 
kick our rear ends. We are all sitting 
here playing tiddlywinks, fumbling 
around, talking about climate change 
and diversity quotas and chief diver-
sity officers, and China is actually pre-
paring to kick our rear ends.

November 2, 2021 
Recently, as many of my colleagues 
know, China tested a nuclear-capable 
hypersonic glide vehicle, carried on a 
rocket, that flew low-orbit space, cir-
cling the globe before speeding toward 
its target, only missing by about 24 
miles, a test that was reported to have 
‘‘stunned’’ the United States military. 
Well, that is concerning both because 
of the capabilities of the Chinese and 
the fact that our U.S. military was 
stunned. Both of those two things are 
concerning. 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Milley, interrupting no doubt a par-
ticularly enthralling session of diver-
sity, equity, and inclusion over at the 
Department of Defense at the Pen-
tagon, bolted out from that really im-
portant session and said in an inter-
view that the Chinese military was ex-
panding rapidly, and the recent missile 
test is close to a Sputnik moment. 
Indeed, this test comes after recent 
revelations that China has constructed 
and is making significant progress in 
developing at least 250 new missile 
silos at as many as three locations 
across China, fueling a rapid nuclear 
buildup. 
In the wake of Biden’s disastrous Af-
ghanistan withdrawal, China is in-
creasingly willing to increase hos-
tilities toward Taiwan. Just last week, 
Taiwan’s President said the threat 
from China is growing every day. She 
said: 
‘‘When 
authoritarian 
regimes 
demonstrate expansionist tendencies, 
democratic countries should come to-
gether to stand against them. Taiwan 
is on the front lines.’’ This is a nation 
of 23 million people opposed to com-
munism. 
Where is President Biden? Where is 
this Congress? Where are my Demo-
cratic colleagues? Wrestling around 
with their $2 or $3 trillion spendathons 
but not doing anything to help us fig-
ure out how to send a signal to the 
world that we are going to stand along-
side Taiwan and, more importantly, 
that we are going to be strong for 
America against a rising Chinese mili-
tary. 
Biden 
recently 
said 
the 
United 
States’ commitment to Taiwan was 
‘‘rock solid,’’ but China is calling his 
bluff. And why shouldn’t they after the 
disastrous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan? 
By the way, it is thanks to Taiwan 
that the world was alerted to the 
coronavirus. On December 31, Taiwan’s 
CDC reported warnings of the virus’ 
human-to-human transmission to the 
World Health Organization in an email. 
This is back at the beginning of the 
pandemic. 
January 3 of that year, CDC Director 
Robert Redfield sent an email to the 
director of the Chinese CDC, formally 
offering to send U.S. experts to China. 
January 5, CDC Director Redfield 
sent another email to the Chinese CDC 
director, formally offering to send U.S. 
experts. 
The WHO even helped China cover 
the threat. 
On January 14, the World Health Or-
ganization tweeted: ‘‘Preliminary in-
vestigations conducted by the Chinese 
authorities have found no clear evi-
dence of human-to-human transmission 
of the novel coronavirus.’’ 
February 24, NANCY PELOSI encour-
aged individuals to come to San Fran-
cisco’s Chinatown. 
We can go on and on, but China got 
busy continuing their coverup, even 
kicking out journalists in 2020. And 
now what do we know? We now know 
that there was gain-of-function re-
search going on; America was funding 
it. And now we see precisely what was 
going on in Wuhan, what was going on 
in China, and America’s involvement 
with it. 
The fact of the matter is, China is se-
rious, and we are not. 
Let’s talk about coal for a minute. 
China’s not taking part in the climate 
hysterics currently taking place in 
Glasgow and is not undercutting its 
own supply of reliable energy like we 
are. Why might that be? Because China 
knows they need reliable power to kick 
our rear ends while we sit around fum-
bling around with a President of the 
United States taking cold baths in 
Scotland. 
According to Time, China is planning 
to build 43 new coal plants while we are 
rapidly decommissioning coal plants 
here at home—not advancing clean- 
burning natural gas, not moving nu-
clear power. No, no, no, we like to live 
out in unicorn land where we are going 
to have nothing but wind and solar 
powering up our entire grid. That has 
not been working out so well for us. 
All so we can go down this fiction 
that we are going to drive down CO2 by 
allowing the Chinese to do whatever 
the hell they want to do while we un-
dermine our own national security, our 
own energy policy, and drive people 
into energy poverty. 
The Chinese are using that coal to 
produce the manufactured goods we 
consume in the United States, includ-
ing 80 percent of our solar panels. 
By the way, the rare earth materials 
we just gave up in Afghanistan by 
abandoning Bagram means we can’t 
even compete on that stage even if you 
want to live in unicorn land where my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
do, where you can have all your power 
come from solar and wind in the year 
2021. 
Literally, my colleagues are in a dis-
pute and a fight about how crazy green 
can the infrastructure bill they want 
to advance or the reconciliation pack-
age they advance be. 
Meanwhile, China leads the world in 
emissions, but they got 43 coal-fired 
plants tuned up. But what do all these 
geniuses over in Scotland do? Well, 
China has promised they won’t build 
coal-fired plants in other parts of the 
world. 
You literally can’t make up how stu-
pid a leadership of a country could pos-
sibly be than what we currently have 
in this country. 
Let me see if I can come up with 
every possible way to weaken our coun-
try, every possible way to make this 
country exposed on the world stage. I 
don’t think I can come up with a better 
plan than what the current administra-
tion and my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle and this body are 
doing. 
I think it would be a great contest. 
What could they do that is worse than 
driving us into energy poverty, taking 
away our ability to compete on the 
worldwide 
stage, 
developing 
clean- 
burning natural gas, exporting that, in-
stead of literally having the President 
of the United States currently begging 
OPEC to open up more oil and more en-
ergy supplies? 
I am not even sure how you can put 
into words how unbelievably pathetic 
it is for the United States of America 
to be on the world stage begging for en-
ergy supplies when we sit on a bed of 
fossil fuels that we can use to power 
this world. We have all the technology 
in the world to develop nuclear power, 
yet we are not doing it. 
Meanwhile, China is importing 800,000 
barrels of Iranian crude per day. Well, 
isn’t that great? 
We have already talked about that 
the President is hanging out over in 
Scotland taking cold water baths, 
mumbling unintelligibly about anti-
trust and animals—I couldn’t even un-
derstand the speech today—while con-
gressional Democrats are in a death 
fight over their trillions of dollars in 
spending. 
Most troubling of all, our Depart-
ment of Defense is in a race, but it is 
not in a race to beat China; it is not in 
a race to beat Iran or to stand next to 
Israel or make sure we have the strong-
est fighting force in the world. No, no, 
the brilliance of the brass over at the 
Pentagon and the Democratic leader-
ship in the White House and in this 
body and in the Senate, it is in a race 
to train our soldiers the finer points of 
critical race theory and climate ide-
ology. I mean, you really can’t even 
make this stuff up. 
It has been 64 days since President 
Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan, and there still has been zero 
accountability for the President, Sec-
retary Austin, NSA Advisor Jake Sul-
livan, and General Milley. 
Do we ever talk in this body? How 
many times do we come down here and 
emote about whatever horror has gone 
on in the world? We do it all the time. 
Have we talked about the drone strike 
that killed 10 people, including 7 chil-
dren, something that would largely 
qualify as a war crime? Where are my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, coming down here and beating 
their chests about the horrors of war 
crimes? Oh, I remember what they 
were saying when President Bush was 
in office in the wake of 9/11. I remem-
ber all the protests. Where are the pro-
tests for this dead family? 
Is this the robust, over-the-horizon 
counterterrorism strategy that they

November 2, 2021 
like to hawk and talk about so much 
that the American people are supposed 
to trust? 
There is an unknown number of 
American citizens—I can read reports 
of over 100, 200, 400—still stranded in 
Afghanistan. Thirteen marines were 
killed, as we know. 
Madam Speaker, $85 billion worth of 
U.S. taxpayer-funded defense assets, 
the Taliban have some number of 
those—access to a biometric database 
of our Afghan allies, control of the over 
$800 million United States Embassy in 
Kabul. Bagram Airfield, here, go ahead, 
take it. 
Now President Biden plans to send an 
additional $144 million to Afghanistan. 
For what? 
But it is not only just abandoning Af-
ghanistan; 
it 
is 
empowering 
the 
Taliban. 
Now our other adversaries: Hamas 
praised the Taliban for causing the 
American downfall in Afghanistan and 
said: ‘‘We congratulate the Muslim Af-
ghan people for the defeat of the Amer-
ican occupation on all Afghan lands, 
and we congratulate the Taliban move-
ment and its brave leadership.’’ 
China capitalized on it, saying ‘‘a les-
son that Taiwan needs to learn.’’ 
Where are my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle? Do they care? 
Iran is set to hold a series of war 
drills with Russia and China. All of 
this is happening right now. 
Again, my Democratic colleagues are 
talking about socialism and race divi-
sion and gender equality. They don’t 
even like the word ‘‘equality’’ any-
more. It has to be ‘‘equity.’’ 
President Biden is appeasing Iran and 
walking away from Israel. Biden re-
fuses to stand up to Iran, attempting to 
rejoin the failed Iran nuclear deal. 
On October 8, the Biden administra-
tion lifted sanctions on two Iranian en-
tities involved in military missile pro-
grams. Over the last 3 months, a report 
showed that China imported nearly 
800,000 barrels of Iranian crude, like I 
mentioned before. And now we are re-
fusing to stand by Israel, our closest 
ally in the Middle East. 
The Biden administration wants to 
reopen the United States Consulate 
General in Jerusalem to provide sepa-
rate diplomatic outreach to the Pal-
estinians, directly undermining Jeru-
salem as Israel’s eternal capital. Re-
joining the Israel-hating United Na-
tions Human Rights Council, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
don’t care, and funneling millions of 
dollars into UNRWA that continues to 
undermine the very existence of Israel. 
Now Congress, in its infinite wis-
dom—both sides of the aisle, by the 
way, my colleagues on my side of the 
aisle, two-thirds of whom are guilty of 
this as well—is saying we need to not 
only give the Pentagon their NDAA, 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
their authorization, we ought to give 
them another $25 billion of authoriza-
tion. 
We are not going to get anything out 
of Milley. We are not going to get any-
thing out of Austin. We are not going 
to get the brass down here and say 
what in the world happened in Afghani-
stan, or can you explain what you are 
doing with all of your chief diversity 
officers and climate education? No, no, 
we are just going to throw them a 
whole bunch more money. 
Again, to my Republican colleagues 
and to my constituents and to all 
Americans: This isn’t done yet. Make 
sure your Senators and your Members 
of Congress know precisely how you 
feel about authorizing a massive de-
fense authorization that gives more 
money to the Department of Defense 
with no accountability for Afghanistan 
and that drafts our daughters. 
b 2045 
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in the in-
finite wisdom of your leaders in Con-
gress and in this administration, the 
plan is to have our 18-year-old girls— 
including my daughter, who is 10—have 
to go down and go sign up for Selective 
Service. 
Most Americans I talk to don’t want 
that. They sure as heck don’t want 
that buried in a whatever-thousand- 
page bill of $800 billion of defense 
spending. 
But respectfully, where are my col-
leagues on this side of the aisle on 
this? Two-thirds of this group voted for 
this bill because, Oh, we can’t not sup-
port the Pentagon. 
Well, why can’t we not support the 
Pentagon when the Pentagon is not ac-
tually running a military designed to 
blow things up and kill people the way 
it needs to, in a world where China 
wants to do us harm, Iran wants to do 
us harm, Iran wants to do Israel harm, 
and we are going to focus on adding 
women to the draft without so much as 
a debate on this floor or in the Senate? 
We are going to include gun-grabbing, 
red flag laws to take guns away from 
our servicemen and women, causing 
them usually to go hide it, not go seek 
mental health, not go get the help they 
might need. 
We are going to promote a radical 
Green New Deal agenda, including a 
sense of Congress that DOD should se-
lect electric or zero-emission models 
when purchasing new, noncombat vehi-
cles; requiring the Secretary of Defense 
to submit to Congress their plan to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions; prais-
ing the Intergovernmental Planet on 
Climate Change; creating a pilot pro-
gram on the use of sustainable aviation 
fuel. 
But they are promoting a woke agen-
da in the Department of Defense. Re-
quiring the Department of Defense to 
hire and train gender advisors, includ-
ing creating an Office of Countering 
Extremism, which would have the 
power to expel military members who 
engage in ‘‘extremist activities or 
members of an extremist organiza-
tion,’’ codifying diversity, equity, and 
inclusion training requirements, sub-
sidizing plan B for servicemembers. 
And now, the Defense Climate Adapta-
tion Plan. You can’t even make this 
stuff up. 
China is sending missiles around the 
globe and we are responding with a De-
fense Climate Adaptation Plan. In 
what universe do the leaders of the 
greatest country in the history of the 
world do this? This new climate change 
plan ordered by President Joe Biden, 
released this last week would affect 
every level of command. 
‘‘Troops will be educated to improve 
their ‘climate literacy’, according to 
the report. The topic should be taught 
to all during professional development 
training and at advanced courses. 
‘‘In order to properly respond, we 
need to have the knowledge, the tools 
and the ability to make climate-in-
formed decisions at all echelons.’’ 
We continue to fund in this NDAA, 
that my colleagues so readily sup-
ported, funding for a Department of 
Defense that engages in critical race 
theory training for servicemembers. 
Last month, the Navy released a rec-
ommended reading list—I am sorry, 
this is last spring—to facilitate the 
growth and development of sailors. One 
of the books on the list is ‘‘How to Be 
an Antiracist’’, Kendi’s bestseller advo-
cating critical race theory. Separately, 
the Navy’s Second Fleet created a book 
club for sailors and recommended read-
ing ‘‘White Fragility,’’ a book that 
White people are inherently racist. 
If you would like to take a perusal of 
the Department of Defense website, 
you can find the Chief Diversity Offi-
cer, Senior Advisor for Diversity, Eq-
uity, and Inclusion, the Director for 
the Office for Diversity, Equity and In-
clusion, the Director for Disability 
Equal Opportunity Policy and Compli-
ance, the Director of the Department 
of Defense Diversity and Inclusion, the 
commandant of the Department of Eq-
uity—I don’t know even know what the 
acronym stands for. 
In 
this 
so-called 
plan: 
Climate 
change is an existential threat to our 
Nation’s security. We must act swiftly 
and boldly to take on this challenge 
and prepare for damage that cannot be 
avoided. 
The Department of Defense intends 
to champion climate considerations in-
side and beyond the Department. That, 
at the Department of Defense. 
The fact of the matter is, while 
China, Iran, perhaps the 5,000 terrorists 
that were released that we had housed 
in Afghanistan, dozens, hundreds of 
terrorist groups across the world, they 
know full well that this country is not 
remotely serious right now about de-
fending ourselves, defending our allies, 
standing 
alongside 
Israel, 
standing 
alongside Taiwan, pushing back on 
China, ensuring our positioning in the 
Middle East is strong. Or, for example, 
securing the southern border of the 
United States, where we increasingly 
find individuals from state sponsors of 
terror from China coming into our 
southern border. It happens much more 
regularly than people understand or 
are comfortable with.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6123 
November 2, 2021 
But no response from here. The re-
sponse to the border, as we know, is to 
encourage more traffic, allow asylum 
to be abused, stop building the fence. 
There are parts of the fence sitting in 
a field rusting in Texas. We are paying 
contractors not to build the fence. But 
paying people not to do things is what 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are particularly good at. 
Let’s borrow lots of money and print 
lots of money to pay people not to 
work. 
Let’s borrow lots of money, print lots 
of money to pay people not to build a 
fence. 
Can I get into the not-doing-things 
business? Maybe my colleagues will be 
glad to have me not do Congress. Can I 
get paid to not do Congress, since we 
are in the not-doing-things business? It 
is absolutely absurd what we are doing 
on a daily basis endangering this coun-
try. 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, 
President 
Biden, utterly refusing to enforce our 
laws of a border, failing to faithfully 
execute the laws, refusing to use Title 
42, refusing to use the Migrant Protec-
tion Protocols. 
Dead bodies keep piling up in South 
Texas. I have talked about it here be-
fore, again, to an empty Chamber. 
Steak dinners are much more impor-
tant than the migrants who are dying 
in South Texas. 
We talked about that, right? We have 
a body trailer that a sheriff had to haul 
in to put the bodies in the body trailer. 
Does anybody care? Does anybody care 
about the rape trees? Does anybody 
care about the stash houses where lit-
tle girls get raped? Does anybody care 
about the cartels making tons of 
money—moving people, by the way, 
into our country who want to hurt us. 
Rather than exporting the rule of law 
and building a strong relationship with 
Mexico and building a strong relation-
ship with Guatemala, El Salvador, 
Honduras—the rest of the Western 
Hemisphere—to kick China’s butt, we 
are retreating. We are importing law-
lessness, importing people who aren’t 
always wanting to do us good. And we 
are endangering our country in the 
process. 
We are shutting down power plants. 
China is building power plants. Our 
President is literally sitting with a 
bunch of leaders who flew 40 some-odd 
private jets to hang out and preach 
about climate change, and they are not 
going to dent climate change. We got 
out of the Paris Agreement, and we 
outperformed the Paris Agreement. 
How? By burning clean, natural gas, 
exporting it and working to try to use 
technology and innovation around the 
world to have clean, abundant energy 
that empowers human flourishing. 
There are billions around the planet 
right now that would die to be sitting 
in a room like this with air condi-
tioning or heating and lighting. They 
are burning dung, wood, paper—what-
ever they can get. And we have all 
these 
holier-than-thou’s 
running 
around preaching to people, taking 
cold water baths, seeking to truly deci-
mate human life, undo human flour-
ishing—all in the name of bowing down 
to the altar of a secular worship of a 
planet that they are actually harming 
with their absurdity. And in the proc-
ess, endangering us through our na-
tional security. 
While China builds coal-fired plants, 
while China builds missiles, we conduct 
classes on critical race theory and on 
climate change. That is what we are 
doing to our country. 
As we look ahead next week, this 
body will not be meeting, and we will 
be celebrating Veterans Day. And 
every single one of us will, no doubt, go 
to an event, try to visit with veterans, 
thanking them for their service. But I 
have got to be honest with you. What 
do I tell those veterans when they 
come to me and say, Were the last 20 
years worth it? 
I would tell them it was worth it be-
cause they fought, and they stood up to 
defend this country to keep terrorists 
from attacking us on this soil. But 
they are asking a reasonable question 
when the President of the United 
States abandons Americans, abandons 
assets, empowers our enemy, empowers 
China, leaves our border open, destroys 
our economy, undermines our ability 
to produce clean burning energy, leaves 
a future for our children weaker 
against the world without the ability 
to have the kind of flourishing and 
prosperity that you deserve as Ameri-
cans. 
I don’t know what the result is going 
to be in Virginia tonight, but I know 
one thing: there are a lot of American 
people awakening to the absolute dis-
aster that is being inflicted on this 
country by a radical leftist regime, 
whether it is in this body, in the Sen-
ate, in this administration, or in the 
Capitol building designed by Jefferson 
in Richmond, Virginia. Or in the halls 
of the school board in Loudoun County, 
sitting on their hands, allowing an-
other little girl to get sexually as-
saulted because they wouldn’t actually 
address the fact that a girl had been as-
saulted and they knew it and they did 
nothing about it. 
And then the Democratic candidate 
in Virginia says parents have no place 
on the school board. But guess what? 
The American people think they do, 
and they are right. The American peo-
ple know we should have parents on 
the school boards, parents in the class-
rooms impacting what their kids are 
learning. And they don’t want to turn 
it over to leftist radicals who want to 
remake our country, teach their kids 
that up is down and down is up. But 
that is what is happening. 
The American people are waking up 
around this country. They are awak-
ening in Virginia. They are awakening 
in Texas. They are awakening where 
they are kicking out people from their 
school boards. And they are awakening 
to an administration that wants to de-
stroy our ability to compete and beat 
China. 
We are not going to do that. We are 
going to beat China. We are going to 
stand with Israel. We are going to have 
clean burning energy. We are going to 
be able to power our homes. We are 
going to be able to teach our kids what 
they ought to learn. We are going to 
stand up if there are men and women. 
We are going to stand up for the great-
ness of this country. We are going to 
provide the opportunity for them, not 
by lecturing them, not by mandating 
to them, not by telling them they have 
got to go get a vaccine, not by shutting 
down businesses, not by walking away, 
but by boldly carrying forward the 
America that we know through the 
consent of the governed doing that 
which we can do as Americans, without 
begging for permission from a govern-
ment that wants to weaken our coun-
try rather than advancing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO 
LEGISLATION 
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
ELECTION DAY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am 
going to start with a mask because it 
is a message to all of America: Vote. 
Today is voting day. Please vote. If you 
haven’t voted already, make sure you 
vote. 
JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT 
ACT 
Mr. President, on a very related 
issue, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, last night, I took 
the necessary procedural steps to set 
up a vote on Wednesday in the Senate 
on the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. Tomorrow, the Senate 
is going to take a first vote on whether 
or not we debate—merely debate—a bill 
to reinstate the preclearance provi-
sions of the Voting Rights Act, which 
has long had bipartisan support in this 
Chamber—bipartisan support—in the 
past. 
Our democracy relies on the guar-
antee of free and fair elections to sur-
vive, but across the country, we are 
witnessing a coordinated assault on the 
right to vote and even on how elections 
are conducted, tallied, and potentially 
decided—a true threat to the ultimate 
foundation of our democracy. 
In the past, preclearance helped put a 
check on the worst abuses from the 
States, but a conservative majority on 
the Supreme Court in 2013, in one of 
the worst decisions in recent memory, 
effectively 
crippled 
preclearance, 
wrongly suggesting that it was no 
longer needed. We have seen how wrong 
that decision was in the years since 
2013 and particularly now. Boy, were 
they wrong. In the years since that de-
cision, the floodgates have opened for 
some of the most draconian restric-
tions to the franchise that we have 
seen since the era of segregation. 
The clock is ticking for the Senate to 
stop these attacks. Starting next year, 
State legislatures will return to ses-
sion, and many will surely build on the 
flurry of restrictive laws we are al-
ready seeing in States like Georgia and 
Texas. So if there is any issue that de-
serves debate in this Chamber, it 
should be protecting voting rights. 
The Voting Rights Act has long en-
joyed bipartisan support in this Cham-
ber. Nixon, Reagan, and Bush all signed 
into law updates to the legislation. In

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7578 
November 2, 2021 
fact, many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle proudly pre-
viously worked on and supported pas-
sage 
of 
those 
updates, 
including 
preclearance provisions. It should be no 
different today. 
For months, Senate Democrats have 
bent over backwards to find common 
ground with Republicans on the crit-
ical issue of protecting the freedom to 
vote. We have urged Senate Repub-
licans to engage, to offer their ideas, to 
come together to guarantee free and 
fair elections to all Americans. I have 
made clear time and time again: Demo-
crats are open for business; we want 
Republicans to engage. I am prepared 
to offer an open and honest, full- 
fledged process here on the Senate 
floor 
tomorrow, 
where 
Republican 
amendments will be made in order and 
allowed and debated, but for that to 
happen, Republicans must come to the 
table when we vote tomorrow. We can’t 
force so much as a debate if at least 10 
Republicans don’t join us and vote in 
favor of letting the Senate do its work 
on this most important, this most vital 
of issues. 
Senate 
Republicans 
shouldn’t 
be 
afraid of merely starting debate on an 
issue we have long debated in this body 
and long supported in a bipartisan way 
in the past. If they have different ideas 
on how to achieve a stronger democ-
racy, they owe it to the American peo-
ple to come forward and debate their 
ideas. Simply standing silent with 
their arms crossed, refusing to allow 
the Senate to function, is unaccept-
able. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. President, now on Build Back 
Better, today, Democrats in the House 
and Senate continue making progress 
on passing President Biden’s Build 
Back Better plan. Last night, I held an-
other round of talks with my leader-
ship team, with the Speaker, with the 
White House. With many, we are dis-
cussing so many issues, including mov-
ing forward on prescription drugs. We 
are moving ahead, we are working 
through the outstanding details, and 
we remain committed to getting some-
thing big done for the American people. 
Nobody is getting everything they 
hoped for in the final deal, but Build 
Back Better will have things that ev-
eryone—everyone—wanted. Even as we 
continue finalizing the text, the Presi-
dent’s framework already—already— 
has done very good and important 
things that will dramatically improve 
the lives of everyday Americans. It 
makes historic progress on childcare, 
pre-K, fighting climate change, pro-
viding tax cuts for the middle class, 
housing, and more. 
In years past, passing any one of 
these items would have been considered 
a huge step forward for the country. 
Now, we are working to get them all 
done at once, and we will continue 
making progress. 
The 
framework’s 
provisions 
on 
childcare alone would be the largest in 
American history. Our country’s need 
for childcare has grown dramatically 
since the 20th century. According to 
the Treasury Department, in fact, the 
average cost of caring for a young child 
hovers around $10,000 a year. Many peo-
ple pay more for childcare than they 
pay for their mortgage. Ten thousand 
dollars a year is simply out of reach for 
far too many families. 
Not only do our kids suffer when they 
can’t have somewhere safe to stay, our 
families suffer when they can’t enter 
the workforce, and ultimately our 
country suffers as our economy’s pro-
ductivity is diminished. 
Build Back Better, with its unprece-
dented investments to help families 
better afford childcare, would finally 
provide parents the help they have 
needed for decades. 
That is just one example. American 
families under this framework will for 
the first time also have access to uni-
versal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds 
across the country. It also extends the 
child tax credit passed earlier this year 
so parents can better afford things like 
groceries and diapers and utilities and 
other daily essentials. Since its enact-
ment, this program alone has already 
cut poverty—child poverty—in half in 
this country. That is an amazing ac-
complishment and one that will con-
tinue to go forward under this pro-
posal. 
So President Biden’s Build Back Bet-
ter framework is a historic step for-
ward for families, but that is not all. 
The framework would also make bold 
investments to tackle the climate cri-
sis. 
The consequences of climate change 
are already severe. Every time we face 
another major heat wave, it endangers 
the lives of Americans who work out-
doors. Every time another hurricane 
hits the east coast or the South, it 
risks destroying people’s homes and 
schools and churches and small busi-
nesses. Every time another wildfire 
rages in the West, it fills the air with 
poisonous smoke that entire cities 
breathe in, consequences yet unknown. 
Build Back Better would help our 
country fight this climate threat with 
unprecedented investments in clean 
manufacturing, clean transportation, 
clean electricity, and clean buildings, 
so we can cut our emissions, make our 
communities healthier, and lead the 
world by the power of our example. 
While there still would be much, much 
more work needed to protect our plan-
et, this framework is a bold step in the 
right direction. 
Now, of course, even as we continue 
to negotiations, the President’s Build 
Back Better framework contains many 
other good things. It will help Ameri-
cans keep a safe and stable roof over 
their heads with long-sought invest-
ments in new affordable housing, as 
well as ensuring that we keep housing 
affordable for low- and moderate-in-
come families. 
I have been working night and day 
with my colleagues in both Chambers 
and the White House to make progress 
on lowering the costs of prescription 
drugs. I am very hopeful there will be 
an agreement as early as today that 
will include landmark reforms sought 
by the American people and the Demo-
cratic Party for decades. 
For the first time, Medicare will be 
empowered to negotiate prescription 
drug prices in Part B and Part D. There 
will be an annual cap on out-of-pocket 
costs, a new monthly cap on the price 
of insulin, and an ‘‘inflation’’ rebate 
policy to protect consumers from egre-
gious annual increases in prices. 
These policies are common sense and 
overwhelmingly 
supported 
by 
the 
American people. The deal will finally 
lower the costs of prescription drugs 
for seniors and working families. It 
doesn’t do everything I would want or 
many of us would want, but it takes a 
big step forward. 
All the while, Build Back Better will 
be fully paid for and will ultimately re-
lieve our Nation’s inflationary pres-
sures. Don’t take my word for it. Many 
leading economists have made clear 
that this legislation would improve— 
not worsen—inflation in the country. 
There are a lot of good things in this 
framework, and Democrats are moving 
forward to get a final agreement and 
this bill over the finish line. 
Nobody said that transformative leg-
islation of this scale would be easy, 
quick, or simple, but we remain com-
mitted to meeting our ultimate goal of 
helping working- and middle-class fam-
ilies achieve the American dream in 
the 21st century. 
We want to help those in the middle 
class stay there. They are worried 
about their future and the future of 
their children. We want to help those 
struggling to get to the middle class 
get there more easily by building lad-
ders that they can climb. It is so im-
portant we get this done. This is the 
best opportunity we have had in a long 
time to make that a reality, so we will 
continue marching ahead. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Finally, very quickly, on judges. Mr. 
President, here is a number that every-
one watching the work of the Senate 
should take note of: 28. 
That is the number of Federal judges 
that, after yesterday’s confirmations of 
Beth Robinson and Toby Heytens, the 
Senate has confirmed in a time of 9 
months since President Biden took the 
oath of office: 28 judges—19 to serve on 
district courts, 9 to serve as appellate 
judges. 
And the vast majority of these new 
judges are people of color, a majority 
of them being women, and many from 
backgrounds that have long been over-
looked in selection of our Nation’s 
judges. 
This is more judges put in this period 
of time, the first year—the first 9 
months of the President’s—10 months 
of the President’s first term—than has 
happened in a very long time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
since the earliest days of COVID–19, 
Washington Democrats have admitted 
they want to use the pandemic as the 
pretext to permanently transform our 
country. They hope to use the tem-
porary crisis as a Trojan horse for per-
manent radical change. One of their 
massive, ideological goals is a huge se-
ries of disruptive changes to American 
families’ childcare. 
The story is like Democrats’ long 
march 
toward 
socialized 
medicine: 
take an intimate area of American life, 
pile on a maze of new mandates, regu-
lations, cost increases and subsidies, 
and push families out of the driver’s 
seat so Washington can run their lives. 
Not too long ago, the Democrats’ 
promise 
that 
‘‘if 
you 
liked 
your 
healthcare plan, you could keep it’’ 
was awarded the ‘‘lie of the year.’’ 
Now they want a sequel: If you like 
your childcare, you can keep your 
childcare. 
Democrats want to sweep the first 5 
years of children’s lives into a new set 
of top-down, one-size-fits-all, Wash-
ington-knows-best regulations. 
Their Big Government scheme would 
make childcare more expensive and use 
taxpayer money to subsidize only some 
families—those who structure their ar-
rangements in ways that Democrats 
like. Other families would be left to 
fend for themselves, now in an even 
more inflated market. 
Their bill would give Democrats and 
bureaucrats massive new authority 
they could use to shape curriculum and 
standards 
nationwide. 
If 
providers 
don’t play along, they could be left out 
in the cold. 
The Biden administration wants to 
insert itself into the most intimate 
family decisions and tell parents how 
to care for their toddlers. The entire 
scheme violates the basic principle of 
family fairness. 
Speaker PELOSI suggested last week 
that she approves of one kind of family 
structure: ‘‘Parents earning and chil-
dren learning.’’ 
She said Democrats want govern-
ment programs to ‘‘liberat[e]’’ families 
so that both parents work full time. 
Well, there are lots of families like 
that model, but other families prefer 
other models. Not everybody defines 
‘‘liberation’’ the same way, yet Wash-
ington Democrats want Big Govern-
ment to bless certain family arrange-
ments and not others. 
Has your family made a different set 
of sacrifices so a father or mother can 
parent full time? 
Sorry, Democrats want to redis-
tribute money away from your family 
to other households that may earn 
even more money. 
Has your family built its whole life 
around a plan for a grandparent to pro-
vide in-home care? 
Too bad. Grandma or Grandpa would 
have to fill out paperwork and apply 
for the bureaucrats’ blessing or that 
family could be denied help also. 
Democrats could easily end up taxing 
working-class families with a full-time 
parent in order to subsidize the ar-
rangements of wealthier two-income 
households. They are steamrolling over 
family fairness, over families’ choices 
and options, over the diversity of 
American families and their aspira-
tions. 
By the way, Democrats appear to 
want to change the law in ways that 
could force faith-based providers to put 
aside sincerely held religious beliefs. 
Just look at who would be admin-
istering all this. One key player would 
be HHS Secretary Becerra—the par-
tisan California lawyer who got famous 
by suing Catholic nuns for being too 
Catholic and crisis pregnancy centers 
for being pro-life—a hardcore culture 
warrior. 
And this person is going to be the 
new national czar for early childhood? 
Another key figure would be Sec-
retary Cardona. You may recall, a few 
months back, Senate Republicans had 
to stop our Education Secretary from 
diverting funding for civics education 
towards woke propaganda that had 
been debunked by historians. 
And this is the same Biden adminis-
tration whose Attorney General just 
wrote an entire memo singling out con-
cerned parents who speak up at their 
local school board meetings. Now they 
want to extend their Federal control 
over babies and toddlers as well. 
Finally—get this—this tangled new 
entitlement 
would 
be 
so 
mind- 
bogglingly expensive that Democrats 
can’t even put a long-term dollar 
amount on it. The estimate is that all 
this government meddling will cost 
$400 billion over just the first several 
years. After that, nobody really knows 
what the blank check will add up to. 
Taxpayers are supposed to pony up a 
blank check for the privilege of having 
less control over family choices. I 
think the American people will take a 
pass. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter, each year, the National Defense 
Authorization Act represents the Sen-
ate’s most consequential opportunity 
to help steer the course of defense and 
security policy. It is our chance to lay 
out our priorities for keeping America 
safe. 
For the past 60 years, without excep-
tion, Senate majorities have done the 
job and passed this crucial bill on a bi-
partisan vote, but, this year, our 
Democratic majority is sleepwalking 
toward yet another preventable prob-
lem. 
The process began with earnest delib-
eration among our colleagues on the 
Armed Services Committee. Chairman 
REED and Ranking Member INHOFE pre-
sided over extensive discussions. They 
adopted 143 bipartisan amendments, 
and the committee reported out a final 
bill by a margin of 23 to 3. 
Our colleagues began a process that 
should end with broad support for 
clear, bipartisan priorities, like equip-
ping us to keep up with China’s mili-
tary modernization and combat a new 
generation of terrorist threats, but the 
Democratic leader has left the NDAA 
trapped in limbo while Democrats toy 
with 
another 
reckless 
taxing-and- 
spending spree. 
Neglecting the NDAA denies our 
Armed Forces the certainty they need, 
and it denies the Senate a debate about 
the most consequential national secu-
rity issues. This is especially mis-
guided in light of the Biden adminis-
tration’s erratic, rudderless approach 
to foreign policy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7580 
November 2, 2021 
Just last week, administration offi-
cials acknowledged that hundreds more 
Americans than they initially claimed 
remain trapped in Afghanistan, that 
terrorists in the country are just 
months away from being capable of 
conducting attacks on U.S. soil, and 
that no basing agreements to allow for 
over-the-horizon operations had yet 
been reached. 
Emboldened terrorists are already 
stepping up violence against Americans 
and our allies in the Middle East. The 
administration is failing to deter Iran- 
backed militias in Iraq and Syria. 
The Russian threat has grown since 
President Biden took office, though 
you wouldn’t know it by how quiet 
Senate Democrats have been on the 
subject. Putin is committed to modern-
izing his military to threaten U.S. and 
NATO forces, weaponizing his coun-
try’s energy resources to pressure Eu-
rope, and escalating Russia’s military 
pressure on Ukraine. 
Of course, the American military, 
American industries, and our allies and 
partners are also facing a communist 
China that is hell-bent—hell-bent—on 
dominating trade and repressing dis-
sent. This is not a regional threat but 
a global one. China’s comprehensive 
military modernization is stunning in 
its scope. The PRC is building weapons 
and capabilities to target U.S. forces at 
greater and greater range. We ignore 
this threat at our peril. 
So there is never a good time for 
Congress to abdicate its role in guiding 
and overseeing national security pol-
icy, but the Biden administration’s 
muddled mess of a foreign policy 
makes this an especially terrible time 
for the Senate Democratic majority to 
neglect these issues. 
Chairman REED and Ranking Member 
INHOFE have given us an opportunity to 
fulfill the Senate’s role in a serious, 
consequential way. Now the majority 
needs to let the Senate work. We need 
the kind of serious and rigorous floor 
process that the NDAA deserves. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in all of 
the time I have been in Washington, in 
both the House and the Senate, I have 
seen Republicans in control, in the ma-
jority, and I have seen Democrats in 
the majority. I have been on both sides 
of that, and I have seen Republican 
Presidents and Democrat Presidents. 
But one thing that doesn’t change is 
that, when Democrats get power in 
Washington, they want to expand gov-
ernment, they want to grow govern-
ment, they want to spend money. 
If you just look throughout history, 
at least since the time I have been 
here, that is just a fact. We have al-
ready seen them this year—since the 
President came to power and the 
Democrats have had narrow majorities 
in the House and Senate, which they 
have interpreted somehow as being a 
mandate, but is a dead-even U.S. Sen-
ate—push through on a partisan basis a 
$1.9 trillion spending bill which ex-
panded government. There is a $1.2 tril-
lion infrastructure bill that has passed 
the Senate in a bipartisan way, on 
which there was some agreement, and 
it is still awaiting action in the House 
of Representatives. 
Already—already—in this new ad-
ministration, that represents over $3 
trillion in spending, which is on infra-
structure and some core hard infra-
structure with respect to the bipar-
tisan bill. 
The other bill was of a lot of things 
that the Republicans felt weren’t nec-
essary, particularly after the five bills 
we passed last year in 2020 in response 
to the pandemic. 
By the way, every one of those was 
on a bipartisan basis. So a lot of spend-
ing went on in responding to the pan-
demic—trillions and trillions of dol-
lars. 
The first thing that happened when 
the Democrats came to power was that 
they passed another $2 trillion, and 
then an infrastructure bill. So we have 
already got over $3 trillion spent at a 
time when we have $30 trillion in 
debt—and growing by the day. Yet the 
Democrats’ now proposal is to spend 
$3.5 trillion. Some on their side want to 
spend up to $6 trillion to grow and ex-
pand the government. 
So I guess it doesn’t come as any sur-
prise that that is what Democrats do. 
When they gain power, when they get 
majorities, they want to grow; they 
want to expand government; they want 
to spend more money and raise taxes to 
do it. It is almost like kind of a rite of 
passage in that, if you are going to be 
a good Democrat, this is what you do. 
As I said before, you know, after last 
year, in coming through the pandemic 
at a time when the country had to and 
both sides agreed to address the con-
cerns and the needs that were out 
there—to keep people employed, to 
keep businesses operating and workers 
employed, to support our healthcare 
industry, to support our schools—there 
were enormous amounts of money that 
went into the economy last year. 
You would think that when the 
Democrats took power this time that 
they might want to dial it back and 
just think about seeing how the econ-
omy reacts before going on a full-blown 
effort to grow and expand government 
once again, but what we saw right out 
of the gate, immediately—and, again, 
in a very partisan way—was a $2 tril-
lion spending bill. 
I say that again because we all know 
that the amount of debt that we have 
today dwarfs, eclipses, anything—any-
thing—in history even close to what we 
are talking about. Even if you go back 
to the thirties and the big expansion of 
government then—and, by the way, I 
think part of this is that President 
Biden was convinced that he could be 
the next FDR. And to do that, you have 
got to spend lots of money. And so try-
ing to find stuff to spend it on has been 
a challenge. They have come up with a 
big list, and a list, again, that would be 
financed with a lot of tax increases 
that, I think, would be incredibly 
harmful to the economy. 
But what I want to talk about briefly 
this morning is just what has happened 
as a result of the spending that has al-
ready occurred and what, I think, is 
going to happen if the massive amount 
of spending they want to do from here 
forward actually happens. 
Like I said, we will do everything we 
can to stop it. I think it is just an abso-
lutely disastrous prescription for the 
economy right now and as to what peo-
ple are already experiencing in their 
daily lives. 
Last week, we learned that economic 
growth for the third quarter had fallen 
short of expectations, largely driven by 
a deceleration in consumer spending 
and supply problems of goods and 
labor. 
Meanwhile, American families con-
tinue to deal with what is rapidly be-
coming a serious, long-term inflation 
problem that is attributable, in many 
respects—again, as I will get to later— 
to the amount of spending and the 
number of dollars that have been flood-
ing the economy. 
Last month, consumer prices rose at 
the fastest pace in 30 years. A recent 
estimate from the chief economist at 
Moody’s Analytics suggested that an 
average household is having to spend 
an additional $175 a month on basics, 
thanks 
to 
inflation—175 
bucks 
a 
month. 
That may not sound like much to a 
wealthy Democrat politician, but that 
is a lot of money for an ordinary Amer-
ican family. Having $175 a month can 
be 
the 
difference 
between 
putting 
something away in savings and living 
paycheck to paycheck. It can be the 
difference between whether or not you 
can afford braces for your child or 
whether you have the money to replace 
a broken appliance or to make a need-
ed car repair. 
Our inflation problem has gotten to 
the point that it has overtaken wage 
growth. Inflation is growing faster 
than wages, which means that many 
American families have received a de 
facto pay cut. The growth in wages 
isn’t keeping up with the increase in 
costs in their lives. 
So how did we end up here? 
As I said, a lot of the problem traces 
back to this past March, when the 
Democrats decided to pour a lot of un-
necessary government money into the 
economy under the guise of COVID re-
lief. By the time the President and the 
Democrats took office in January, Con-
gress had passed no fewer than five bi-
partisan COVID relief bills—the most 
recent of them in December. The De-
cember COVID relief bill that we 
passed contained almost $1 trillion in 
funding and met, essentially, all of the 
pressing COVID needs the country was 
facing. 
But that didn’t matter. That didn’t 
matter to the Democrats. Now that 
they were in charge, they were eager to 
take advantage of the opportunity the

COVID crisis presented to push their 
Big Government agenda. So they de-
cided to pass another ostensible COVID 
bill less than 3 months after the De-
cember bill and before a lot of money 
from the December bill had even been 
disbursed. 
They gave $129 billion to schools, 
even though schools had spent just a 
small fraction of the $68 billion they 
had already been given. 
They created a staggering $350 billion 
slush fund for States, despite the fact 
that the majority of States already had 
the money that they needed to deal 
with the pandemic, and many, many 
States were operating in a surplus situ-
ation. 
They extended enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits until September of 2021, 
despite 
the 
millions—literally 
mil-
lions—of available job openings; and 
they made part of the unemployment 
compensation tax-free, creating incen-
tives for Americans to stay on unem-
ployment instead of returning to work. 
Among other things, they provided 
an additional $21 billion in rental as-
sistance, none of which has yet been 
needed. 
In short, their so-called American 
Rescue Plan flooded the economy with 
a 
lot 
of 
unnecessary 
government 
money, and the results were predict-
able: inflation. 
The definition of ‘‘inflation’’ is too 
many dollars chasing too few goods and 
services, and that is exactly the situa-
tion the Democrats created. They sent 
too many dollars into the economy, 
and the economy overheated as a re-
sult. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it. Here is what former Obama eco-
nomic adviser Jason Furman had to 
say recently when discussing our cur-
rent inflation problem: 
The original sin was an oversized American 
Rescue Plan. It contributed to both higher 
output but also higher prices. 
That 
was 
from 
Jason 
Furman, 
Obama’s economic adviser. 
That quote from Mr. Furman ap-
peared in a recent New York Times ar-
ticle that also noted: 
But some economists, including veterans 
of previous Democratic administrations, say 
much of Mr. Biden’s inflation struggle is 
self-inflicted. Lawrence H. Summers is one 
of those who say the stimulus bill the presi-
dent signed in March gave too much of a 
boost to consumer spending . . . Mr. Sum-
mers, who served in the Obama and Clinton 
administrations, says inflation now risks 
spiraling out of control and other Demo-
cratic economists agree there are risks. 
So what are congressional Democrats 
doing in response? Well, they are plan-
ning to flood the economy with even 
more 
government 
dollars. 
That 
is 
right. Instead of keeping a sharp eye on 
government spending to make sure our 
inflation situation doesn’t get worse, 
Democrats are planning to double down 
on the strategy that got us into this 
position in the first place. 
Democrats are trying to finalize a 
new—now it is $1.75 trillion—tax-and- 
spending spree, the so-called Build 
Back Better plan, on top, as I said, of 
the $1.9 trillion spending spree from 
earlier this year. And I say $1.75 tril-
lion, but Democrats have only arrived 
at that number through a combination 
of shell games and budget gimmicks. 
The real cost of this proposal over 10 
years is going to be way, way higher— 
way, way higher; some estimates in the 
$4 trillion range. 
So, once again, Democrats want to 
flood the economy with government 
dollars, including billions for such pri-
orities as tree equity—tree equity—and 
environmental 
justice 
programs 
at 
well-funded colleges and universities. 
That is right—Ivy League schools that 
don’t have problems financially, where 
students pay tens of thousands of dol-
lars in tuition every year, will get tax 
credits if they teach courses on envi-
ronmental justice. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that I be able to complete my re-
marks before the vote begins. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am 
forcibly reminded that the definition of 
‘‘insanity’’ is the doing the same thing 
over and over again and expecting dif-
ferent results. What exactly do Demo-
crats think is going to happen to infla-
tion if they pass this $1.75 trillion leg-
islation? Do they think that if one 
round of excessive government spend-
ing triggered inflation, another round 
of excessive government spending is 
going to cure it? Do they think that 
dumping more fuel into an already 
overheated economy is somehow going 
to put out the inflationary fire? If they 
do, they have got another think com-
ing. 
The only thing Democrats’ latest 
spending spree is going to do is make 
our inflation problem worse. We are al-
ready looking at serious inflation last-
ing well into next year. Add Demo-
crats’ Build Back Better spending spree 
to the mix, and we could be looking at 
a very, very long period of inflated 
prices and reduced spending power for 
American families. 
Democrats were warned that their 
March spending spree could spur infla-
tion; they passed it anyway. So I don’t 
have a lot of hope that Democrats are 
going to heed concerns about inflation, 
even coming from their own econo-
mists, when it comes to their current 
tax-and-spending plan, but I and every 
other 
Republican 
will 
stand 
firm 
against this reckless tax-and-spending 
spree and will continue to urge our 
Democratic colleagues to rethink their 
spending agenda before inflation soars 
out of control and American families 
have to suffer the consequences. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF JONATHAN DAVIDSON 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am 
coming to the floor to talk about a 
nominee that we have before us this 
afternoon, who is nominated by Presi-
dent Biden to be the Deputy Under Sec-
retary of the Treasury for Legislative 
Affairs. 
He is a person who is well known to 
this Chamber. He spent roughly 20 
years working in the Senate. He start-
ed out as Senator Paul Sarbanes’ body 
man years and years and years ago and 
became chief of staff for Senator Sar-
banes when Senator Sarbanes was the 
chair of the Banking Committee. He 
worked in the House for Representative 
Sarbanes, was chief counsel to Senator 
WARNER, and then came to my office 
and was my chief of staff. 
His name is Jon Davidson, and he 
worked for the people of Colorado and 
for the country for about 10 years in 
that role. When he came over as my 
chief of staff, it was very shocking to 
me that he was willing to do it because 
he had a good job and he was doing 
really well for Senator WARNER. But it 
gave him the chance to run a Senate 
office, and he did an extraordinary job 
not just because of his understanding 
of policy and his understanding of poli-
tics—a lot of people have that around 
this place—but also his understanding 
of human nature and his belief that in 
all of us, even those of us who are Sen-
ators, there can be a gem of goodness 
in us to be found and to be brought 
along and to be grown. And that was 
true not just for me, but for the entire 
staff. 
He was an incredible mentor to prob-
ably hundreds of people who worked for 
me over the years, both in the State of 
Colorado and in here. He was an ex-
traordinary manager who led with in-
tegrity and discipline and drive. 
And while I was extremely sorry to 
lose him, I wasn’t at all surprised that 
President Biden and the Secretary of 
the Treasury wanted him at Treasury, 
where he could take what he had 
learned on Capitol Hill and apply it at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7583 
November 2, 2021 
a moment when the country urgently 
needs leadership like the leadership 
that Jon Davidson can provide. 
Just one example: You know, Mr. 
President, I ran a not very well noticed 
campaign for President the last time 
we were having a campaign for Presi-
dent, and I ran it on the idea that we 
could cut childhood poverty almost in 
half in this country by adopting the 
changes that I had proposed to the 
child tax credit with Senator BROWN 
from Ohio and Senator BOOKER from 
New Jersey and then-Senator Harris 
from California. 
But, like with anything else a Sen-
ator does, the work is actually done 
often by the members of that Senator’s 
staff. And in the case of Jon, the vision 
also came from him and from Charlie 
Anderson—another staff member that I 
had—and the entire team that worked 
together not just for that Presidential 
campaign but to make sure that, in the 
wake of it, that could actually become 
law. 
And because of Jon’s tenacity, among 
other things, and his willingness to be 
able to raise this issue again and again 
and again in rooms full of staff but also 
in 
rooms 
full 
of 
Senators, 
those 
changes in the child tax credit are now 
the law of the land, and we are cutting 
childhood poverty in this country al-
most in half this year. It is one of the 
signature 
accomplishments, 
in 
my 
mind, of the Biden administration. It is 
one that I hope that we are going to be 
able to continue. 
So, obviously, I was extremely sad to 
see him go. I was very, very pleased to 
see the broad bipartisan support that 
the cloture vote on his nomination en-
gendered. And I know great things are 
ahead for Jon and for the country be-
cause of his leadership. 
He knows, I think, that he has got an 
open invitation to come back anytime 
that he wants to. 
Before I leave the floor, I also want 
to say a special word of gratitude to 
his dad Garber, who lives in Baltimore; 
and to his wife Erin; and to his chil-
dren Leo, Mia, and Serena—all of 
whom have been part of the efforts 
that we have undertaken on behalf of 
the people I represent in Colorado over 
the last decade and on behalf of the 
United States of America. 
These opportunities for public service 
that all of us have are ones that can’t 
be accomplished without our families; 
without, I know in the case of Jon, the 
mentorship that he received from his 
father, who himself was a distinguished 
public servant in the United States, 
and also the support of his family. 
So I am filled with great happiness 
today that we are going to have a 
great, positive, bipartisan vote on Jon 
Davidson, as it should be. And perhaps 
that is a sign of things to come when 
the kind of quality of somebody like 
Jon Davidson is recognized in a way 
that it causes us to act not in a par-
tisan way but in a bipartisan way, to 
embrace his public service but also a 
vision for the country that can move 
us forward. 
So congratulations to Jon Davidson. 
Congratulations to his family, to the 
Department of the Treasury, and to the 
United States of America. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor.

NOMINATION OF JEFFREY M. PRIETO 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the confirma-
tion of Jeffrey Prieto to serve as gen-
eral counsel of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency. Mr. Prieto was re-
ported favorably from our committee, 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, on a bipartisan vote of 12 
to 8. 
Yesterday, I received an interesting 
letter from a bipartisan group of four 
former 
EPA 
general 
counsels 
rep-
resenting the Trump administration, 
the Obama administration, and the ad-
ministrations of George W. Bush and 
Bill Clinton. They were basically con-
veying the same message: They support 
the confirmation of Jeffrey Prieto to 
serve as general counsel of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency. That 
doesn’t happen every day. We get let-
ters of support from nominees, dif-
ferent parties, different Agencies from 
time to time, but to have four former 
EPA general counsels from two Repub-
lican administrations of late and two 
Democratic administrations all in sup-
port of the nomination of Jeffrey 
Prieto to serve in this important role— 
that got my attention, and I hope it 
gets the attention of all of my col-
leagues. 
Those who wrote to us, the four who 
wrote to us, very correctly point out 
that Mr. Prieto is, and I quote—these 
are their words, not mine—‘‘uniquely 
qualified for the position of General 
Counsel for the EPA. 
They go on to say: 
Mr. Prieto has been a longstanding cham-
pion of human health and Environmental 
protection for all Americans. 
The letter continues: 
He is fair, just, and ethical. He will make 
decisions strictly based on the facts, science, 
and the law. We expect he will [be] ready to 
serve on day one. 
Not surprisingly, I completely agree 
with their sentiments. Having come to 
know Mr. Prieto following his nomina-
tion by President Biden, I believe he 
will be an outstanding EPA general 
counsel. He comes from a patriotic 
Latino family with a proud history of 
military service. He has the intellect, 
temperament, and experience to serve 
in this important role. 
Six years ago, this body saw fit to 
confirm Jeffrey Prieto unanimously for 
the same position, general counsel, at 
the Department of Agriculture. We 
should confirm him again today for 
this post. He was the right choice then; 
he is the right choice now. I encourage 
our colleagues to join me in supporting 
his nomination. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the sched-
uled vote occur immediately. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

RESTORING TRUST IN PUBLIC HEALTH ACT 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I have 
now come to the Senate floor 12 times 
to speak against President Biden’s un-
constitutional 
and 
unwise 
vaccine 
mandate. I have introduced 12 bills to 
counter and limit the mandate. Each 
time I have asked for one of these 
bills—each 
of 
which 
should 
be 
uncontroversial—and tried to get the 
Senate to pass them, one Senator or 
another from across the aisle has ob-
jected. 
Some of these bills have required 
only transparency. Other bills would 
have ensured that religious and med-
ical exemptions be honored. Others 
still would simply require parental 
consent before vaccinating children. 
While far from the right answer of 
empowering Americans with all the in-
formation to make the decision them-
selves on when, whether, and under 
what circumstances to receive the 
COVID–19 vaccine, these commonsense 
bills would make the situation better. 
Each one of them would make it bet-
ter. Each one of them is and properly 
should be uncontroversial. 
Now, throughout the process, I have 
been criticized by those on the other 
side of the aisle. I have been accused of 
attacking science and our institutions 
and somehow perpetuating the virus. 
Nothing could be further from the 
truth—nothing. I am for the vaccine. I 
have been vaccinated. Every member of 
my family has been vaccinated. I have 
encouraged others to be vaccinated all 
along. Nevertheless, Madam President, 
my support for the vaccine cannot, 
must not, and will never supersede my 
sworn oath to uphold, protect, and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States; nor can it supersede the rights 
of Americans who should, in any free 
society, in any fair society, be at lib-
erty to make their own properly in-
formed medical decisions. This right 
has been recognized and it has been 
rightly celebrated throughout Amer-
ican history. 
Another principle deeply enshrined, 
embedded, built into our Constitution 
that has been wholly ignored in imple-
menting this mandate and countless 
other infringements of the rights and 
freedoms of Americans is the separa-
tion of powers. Checks and balances re-
quire that all ministers, consuls, and 
officers of the United States be con-
firmed by the advice and consent of the 
Senate. Some of us take that responsi-
bility very seriously. 
Any commissioned officer in the 
military being promoted to O–4 rank or 
higher requires Senate confirmation. 
That, of course, is the equivalent of a 
major in the Army. In other areas of 
government, positions such as mem-
bers of the Advisory Board for Cuba 
Broadcasting, the board of the African 
Development Foundation, members of 
the National Councils on the Arts and 
Humanities, members of the National 
Science Board, and board members of 
the Corporation for National and Com-
munity Service all require Senate con-
firmation—every one of them. 
Oddly, one position that has exerted 
huge power over the American people, 
particularly in recent years, does not 
require Senate confirmation. The Di-
rector of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention manages over 
10,000 employees and has requested 
over $15 billion for the Centers’ fiscal 
year 2022 budget. 
The CDC, in recent months, has sus-
pended property rights nationwide. It 
has provided capricious recommenda-
tions that local and State officials 
have used to strictly limit freedoms 
across the country. The CDC has shown 
through its own actions and the effects 
of those actions just how powerful it is. 
The sheer immensity of the CDC’s 
power has been demonstrated over and 
over and over again on wide public, 
very prominent display for the Amer-
ican people to see and witness and ex-
perience. 
We can and we should debate the au-
thorities of the CDC here in Congress 
because Congress is, of course, the 
branch of government most account-
able to the people at the most regular 
intervals. That is why the most dan-
gerous powers, really, are lodged here,

is because of the fact that we stand ac-
countable to the people at the most 
regular intervals. Every Member of the 
House stands for election every 2 years. 
A third of the Senate stands for reelec-
tion every 2 years. So we should debate 
and discuss the authorities of the CDC 
here in Congress for that very reason. 
I look forward to that discussion, 
which we need to have more of, but the 
matter at hand today is much simpler. 
We must consider whether the CDC Di-
rector ought to be confirmed by the 
U.S. Senate. Now, it is absurd to think 
that someone so powerful can assume 
this office with no say whatsoever from 
the legislative branch. It is even more 
absurd to say that the Senate confirms 
members of an advisory board on 
broadcasting in Cuba to protect the in-
terests of the American people—those 
we represent and those who elected 
us—but that it has no business con-
firming someone to be the Director of 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
My bill would fix that problem. The 
Restoring Trust in Public Health Act 
would require that the CDC Director be 
confirmed by the Senate. This bill is 
cosponsored by Senators BLACKBURN, 
TUBERVILLE, SULLIVAN, BRAUN, TILLIS, 
and SCOTT of Florida. I appreciate their 
support for this long-past-due measure. 
In order to increase trust in the vac-
cine and trust in government, we must 
return 
transparency 
and 
account-
ability to the process. This bill, in the 
spirit of the Constitution, would pro-
vide an important check on govern-
ment power and give the people a say 
in the CDC. 
Now, today, I had planned to ask the 
Senate to pass this bill by unanimous 
consent. However, just in the last few 
hours, I have learned that negotiations 
are now underway and a deal may well 
be struck in order to make this pro-
posal or something very similar to it 
law. In light of that development, I will 
withhold my live UC request for today. 
But I will note here that if progress 
isn’t made on such a deal, I will be 
back soon—certainly before the end of 
the year—to ask this body to imme-
diately take up and pass S. 2734. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Illinois. 
VETERANS DAY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, next 
week, our Nation will commemorate 
Veterans Day. It will be the first time 
in a generation that we will honor that 
day as a nation no longer at war. 
With the conclusion of the war in Af-
ghanistan—the longest war in our his-
tory—thousands of American troops fi-
nally came home. These heroes have 
returned to our shores, just as this Vet-
erans Day stands as a reminder of ev-
erything we owe them, as well as every 
American who has served this Nation 
in uniform. More than 2,400 Americans 
perished in the war in Afghanistan. 
Thousands more return home with 
wounds—visible 
and 
invisible—that 
will stay with them for life. 
Words are not enough to honor that 
sacrifice. We need to ensure that our 
veterans and families have access to 
the best healthcare in the world, af-
fordable housing, programs that sup-
port them as civilians, whether it is 
students, employees or businessowners. 
To serve our Nation in uniform takes 
a special measure of courage and devo-
tion. For some members of our mili-
tary, it also takes a great deal of per-
sistence and determination. 
Let me tell you about one. I am 
speaking, of course, of those members 
of our military who were born in other 
nations and want to serve America. 
Over the years, I have shared the story 
of one of these heroes—his name: Oscar 
Vasquez. 
When Oscar was 12 years old, his fam-
ily made the journey across the border 
from Mexico to America. They settled 
in Arizona. From the time he was a 
child, Oscar dreamed of serving Amer-
ica in the military. He studied hard in 
high school, even joined high school 
ROTC. 
But during his junior here, he ran 
into a problem. He tried to sign up for 
basic training, but the recruiter in-
formed him that he couldn’t serve in 
the U.S. military without a U.S. birth 
certificate. It was a tough setback, but 
Oscar was determined. 
He was awarded JROTC officer of the 
year by his high school, and he led a 
group of students in an underwater ro-
botics competition. They squared off— 
these high school students—squared off 
against college students from schools 
like MIT. Guess what. They won. The 
victory led him to Arizona State Uni-
versity, where he earned a degree in 
mechanical engineering. 
After graduating, Oscar got married 
and had a child, but his undocumented 
status still prevented him from reach-
ing his full potential, so he moved back 
to Mexico—a country he hadn’t lived in 
since he was a young boy—to apply for 
legal entry into the United States. He 
would have been barred from reen-
tering the United States and separated 
from his family for 10 years without a 
special waiver, so he decided to call my 
office. 
He reached out to us and said: ‘‘Can 
you help me get a waiver?’’ 
When the Department of Homeland 
Security finally granted it, Oscar came 
home to America. 
What was the first thing that he did? 
He got his paperwork in order and en-
listed in the U.S. Army. Within 6 
months of returning to the United 
States, he was off to basic training. 
Oscar served our Nation with honor as 
a cavalry scout in Afghanistan. And, 
today, he is finally an American cit-
izen. 
We spend so much time around here 
talking about immigrants in negative 
terms. You look at Oscar and the sac-
rifice he made to serve our Nation in 
the military—this man who came to 
the United States as a little boy, knew 
what his goal was, and it was to risk 
his life for this great Nation. 
When I hear some of the speeches 
given 
on 
the 
floor—one 
yesterday 
about how the United States is going 
to give a million dollars to every one of 
these undocumented people—I think to 
myself, these preposterous, outlandish, 
exaggerated stories told about these 
immigrants belie the real determina-
tion many of them have to come to 
this country and make a difference in 
their lives and a difference in our fu-
ture. 
Oscar is a living example. Oscar, like 
so many others, fought for our Nation 
in every war in our history. But even 
those who are ready to risk everything 
in America, for them, our immigration 
system still is broken. 
During this pandemic, thousands of 
DACA recipients and undocumented 
immigrants have actually helped save 
lives across America. They didn’t en-
list in the Army. They used their skills 
as doctors and nurses and paramedics 
and respiratory therapists. They may 
have saved a member of your family, 
these immigrants. 
On farms throughout the country, 
thousands 
more 
performed 
back-
breaking labor to put food on our table. 
Donald Trump’s administration classi-
fied them as ‘‘essential workers.’’ I 
think, 
for 
once, 
President 
Donald 
Trump was right. 
The pandemic has proven how much 
we depend on immigrants as members 
of the military, first responders, and 
agriculture workers. We couldn’t func-
tion without them. 
That is precisely why reforming our 
broken immigration system is an inte-
gral part of President Biden’s Build 
Back Better. We must include protec-
tions 
for 
immigrants, 
like 
Oscar 
Vasquez, who have given everything 
they can to America. 
If we want to rebuild our economy 
and drive its growth for years to come, 
we should begin by ensuring that im-
migrants can earn their place in the 
American story. 
How many examples do each one of 
us know in our own families and other 
families where these immigrants came 
to America with literally nothing? 
Many of them couldn’t speak the lan-
guage and went hard at work to estab-
lish a life, a family, a community, a 
business that ended up helping the en-
tire Nation. 
Immigration reform could boost our 
Nation’s GDP by more than $1 trillion 
over the next 10 years—hundreds of 
thousands of new jobs. And don’t buy 
this theory that it is zero-sum when it 
comes to the creation of jobs. We have 
found over and over again that a deter-
mined, hard-working person takes a job 
and helps create a new job in the proc-
ess. It happens with the creation of 
business, the creation of jobs over and 
over again. 
It is far past time to reform our im-
migration system. With the Build Back 
Better package, we can finally get it 
done.

reconciliation, we are on the cusp of a

November 2, 2021 
historic accomplishment. This Build 
Back Better agenda is part of a great 
American tradition: marshaling our 
Nation’s resources and ingenuity to 
build a better future for our country. 
This is the strategy that drove our 
victory in World War II or the Cold 
War and our dominance now in the Age 
of Information. 
Years of gridlock left us at risk of 
falling behind. Our competitors on the 
global stage, like China, sense an op-
portunity. They look at the same sta-
tistics we view. And those statistics 
tell a sobering story. 
For example, America used to lead 
the world in the best roads and bridges, 
but today, according to the World Eco-
nomic Forum, we rank 13th. 
How is that for a slogan? 
Our Nation has also fallen behind 
when it comes to educational attain-
ment. We rank 35th out of the 37 major 
countries when it comes to investing in 
early childhood information and care. 
Our economy is the most unequal it 
has ever been since the Gilded Age, 
leaving behind millions of American 
families who are struggling to pay 
their bills. 
The Build Back Better agenda, in-
spired by Joe Biden’s administration, 
is a once-in-a-generation opportunity 
to restore the American promise. It 
will create millions of jobs and ensure 
every family has a chance to live in 
dignity and protect our children’s and 
grandchildren’s future. 
Sadly, like the American Rescue 
Plan, we still don’t have a single Re-
publican who will step up and join us. 
I hope that changes. 
In my home State of Illinois, the 
Build Back Better package would be 
life-changing. It will fund high-quality 
childcare for more than 750,000 chil-
dren. 
I have told the story before of how— 
when my son Paul learned that his wife 
Tanja was going to have a baby, they 
called the grandparents right away. 
The next call was to a daycare center 
to enlist their little baby—they didn’t 
know was a boy or girl—as early as 
possible in their neighborhood daycare 
center. That shows you the kind of de-
mand there is in quality daycare. 
We also need to make preschool a re-
ality for more than 250,000 additional 
children in Illinois with this package. 
That is a million children combined, 
between childcare and preschool, that 
will finally be able to access high-qual-
ity care and education. 
The Build Back Better package will 
also prevent hundreds of thousands of 
kids from going hungry. And it will 
give low-wage workers a tax cut of up 
to $1,500 a year. 
How is that for a change? 
Four years ago, in the Trump admin-
istration, the Republican priority was 
a tax cut for the highest income Amer-
icans. 
Our priority, the Democratic Biden 
priority, is a tax cut for working fami-
lies and lower-income families to give 
them a fighting chance to make ends 
meet. 
These are just a few of the provisions 
included in the Build Back Better 
package. 
I might add something that is often 
mistaken. What I have just described 
to you is fully paid for. We pay for it 
by making certain that those who are 
making the highest incomes in Amer-
ica and the corporations that are the 
most profitable pay their fair share of 
taxes. This is policymaking at its 
best—fair and fiscally responsible. 
Yet when our Republican colleagues 
hear how these investments will ease 
the burdens of working families, they 
seem to have one takeaway. It is the 
one thing we hear from them over and 
over: ‘‘Socialism1’’ 
I mentioned that the Build Back Bet-
ter agenda is part of the great Amer-
ican tradition. Well, that word ‘‘social-
ism’’ is part of the American tradition, 
too, on the Republican side, but one 
that hasn’t stood the test of time. 
Let’s look back at history, at how 
many times the word ‘‘socialism’’ has 
been thrown around. During the Great 
Depression, President Franklin Roo-
sevelt proposed Social Security to pro-
tect the elderly from financial ruin. In 
response, one Republican lawmaker de-
clared Roosevelt ‘‘the first Communist 
President of the United States’’ and ac-
cused him of advancing a ‘‘Socialist 
platform.’’ 
Sound familiar? 
Thirty years later, a similar debate 
played out over the creation of Medi-
care. The American Medical Associa-
tion even recruited a future President, 
Ronald Reagan, to cut a television ad 
to record an album warning the public 
about the dangers of ‘‘socialized medi-
cine.’’ 
Well, more than a century later, the 
vast majority of Americans are still 
covered by private health insurance. 
But Medicare is one of the most pop-
ular programs in America. 
Can you imagine where American 
seniors and families would be today if 
we had listened to those socialist de-
nunciations of Social Security and 
Medicare? 
Here is one more example from the 
Great Depression: When joblessness in 
America reached 25 percent and Con-
gress was considering the creation of 
America’s first unemployment insur-
ance system, a Congressman named 
Samuel Dickstein decried the idea of 
unemployment insurance as an ‘‘out- 
and-out communist program.’’ 
Now, you need to hear the rest of the 
story because, years after he made that 
declaration, it was discovered that 
Samuel Dickstein was a Soviet spy. 
Time and again, the claim of social-
ism has been bandied about to oppose 
commonsense policies that help work-
ing families get by. Now, as then, these 
claims have no basis in reality. It is a 
smear tactic that is, once again, being 
used to frighten Americans and distort 
and derail a meaningful debate. 
Let’s get past the name-calling and 
get down to basics. Do you support yet 
another huge tax cut for massive cor-
porations? Or is it time—at long last— 
to support working families? 
Our Republican colleagues answered 
that question when they were in 
charge. They took on nearly $2 trillion 
of debt in America to cut taxes for cor-
porations and the wealthy. It seems 
they are happy with that brand of so-
cialism, so long as it benefits major 
corporations and those who are well- 
off. 
Democrats believe in putting work-
ing families first, which is why the 
Build Back Better package includes 
the biggest tax cut—let me repeat 
that—it includes the biggest tax cut— 
for working and middle-class families 
in American history, and we believe in 
making smart investments in good- 
paying jobs. 
We have an opportunity to do all of 
this by enacting President Biden’s 
Build Back Better agenda. Let’s con-
tinue this great tradition and fight off 
the charges that we are somehow laps-
ing into socialism. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO DEREK COATS 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, there are 
lots of things we disagree on here on 
the Senate floor, but one thing we all 
agree on is the importance of getting 
the right people to help us do these 
jobs. 
I rise today to honor one of my out-
standing staff members, Derek Coats. 
Derek has recently been awarded the 
Great Griffon Award by his alma 
mater, Missouri Western State Univer-
sity in St. Joseph, MO. The Great Grif-
fon Award is given to those Missouri 
Western alumni who have made out-
standing contributions to the work-
force, to society, or to Missouri West-
ern. Derek has done all three. 
After graduating from Missouri West-
ern in 2002, with a bachelor’s degree in 
political science, Derek began his serv-
ice to Missouri in the U.S. Senate, in 
the office of my predecessor, Senator 
Bond. He served on Senator Bond’s 
staff through 2010 in a variety of dif-
ferent jobs, rising to the role of district 
office director. 
When I came to the Senate in 2011, I 
asked Derek to join my team. Since 
then, he has served as my State direc-
tor and deputy chief of staff, over-
seeing day-to-day operations across 
five statewide offices. 
Derek regularly spends his days trav-
eling the State, meeting with Missou-
rians and hearing their issues and con-
cerns. The information he shares with 
me from those visits ensures our work 
in Washington aligns with the critical 
needs and priorities of our State. To 
provide just one of many examples, 
this information assisted in my efforts 
to work with others to restore year- 
round Pell grants to community col-
leges and all colleges and universities 
in our State. That, of course, included 
Derek’s alma mater, Missouri Western. 
Derek’s knowledge and experience 
are an incredible asset to me and to

our entire team. The work he has done 
in the Senate has touched the lives of 
so many Missourians, and our State is 
all the better because of it. Missou-
rians and I have benefited from having 
Derek on our team, and I am glad he is 
being recognized for his hard work. He 
has so much to be proud of, as does his 
wife Kellie Ann and his son Carter. 
It is certainly my pleasure to join 
Missouri Western State University in 
honoring Derek Coats for his service to 
the State of Missouri and, frankly, for 
his service to the entire country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ENERGY POLICIES 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Mr. 
President, 
in 
watching from the sidelines and since 
we are not directly involved and be-
cause the Democrats decided to go it 
alone, our Democratic colleagues ap-
pear to be playing a game of whack-a- 
mole to keep their reckless tax-and- 
spending spree from falling apart. 
After months and months of intra- 
party 
negotiating—again, 
talking 
among themselves, not to us—they hit 
the gas pedal last week when they 
knew that President Biden was going 
to the U.N. Climate Summit in Glas-
gow, Scotland, and they wanted to give 
him something that he could actually 
deliver on. 
So, last Friday, they finally settled 
on a framework, but the cracks quickly 
began to show. We don’t even have a 
pricetag on this proposal, but some 
have estimated its cost at $1.75 tril-
lion—an absolutely staggering amount 
of money. The truth is no one knows 
because the bill hasn’t even been final-
ized yet, much less scored by congres-
sional scorekeepers. 
Unsurprisingly, yesterday, one of our 
colleagues, the Senator from West Vir-
ginia, expressed some of his skepticism 
about the proposal; and I imagine more 
are in the wings, wringing their hands 
in private. After all, this bill spends 
trillions of dollars on radical priorities 
that are out of step with where most 
Americans are: expanded healthcare 
subsidies; handouts for labor unions; 
government-funded childcare; and an 
all-out attack on American-made, af-
fordable energy. 
On Friday, the President touted the 
$555 billion that this agreement would 
put forward to support clean energy ef-
forts, but these, upon further inspec-
tion, are mainly subsidies—taxpayer 
subsidies—for 
corporations 
and 
the 
well-off. 
I am reminded of France’s yellow 
jacket protests a few years ago. In 2018, 
hundreds of thousands of demonstra-
tors took to the streets in Paris to pro-
test a hike in gas taxes. At the time, 
President Macron said the increase was 
critical to pushing the French people 
to buy cleaner vehicles, but for most 
hard-working families, pricey electric 
vehicles simply were not and are not 
an option. The yellow jackets felt dis-
enfranchised by the urban elite, saying 
leaders were talking about the end of 
the world while they were worried 
about the end of the month. 
It sounds pretty familiar. Here in the 
United 
States, 
families 
are 
being 
pounded by inflation. Prices are going 
up on everything from groceries to 
home appliances. Gas prices alone have 
gone up 60 percent from just 1 year ago, 
and families are doing their best to 
prepare for an expensive winter. En-
ergy bills are expected to soar by as 
much as 54 percent. 
Despite the serious financial strain 
that families are feeling, our Demo-
cratic colleagues are pushing policies 
that will drive up those costs even 
more. 
But here is the real kicker: Often 
under these proposed policies, the 
wealthiest of Americans will stand to 
benefit the most on the backs of hard- 
working American families. 
One of the most clear-cut examples is 
the aggressive push toward subsidizing 
electric vehicles, which are among the 
most expensive cars on the market. 
Now, with 280 million cars on the road, 
only 2 percent of which are electric ve-
hicles, this will not benefit most hard- 
working American families. It will ben-
efit those who can afford these expen-
sive vehicles, and the cherry on top is 
the up to $12,500 taxpayer subsidy that 
will help those wealthy Americans buy 
these expensive vehicles that are out of 
reach for most hard-working families. 
It doesn’t matter if the vehicle is 
completely or substantially made in 
China, for example, or if the buyer 
makes hundreds of thousands of dollars 
a year—they are still eligible for the 
tax credit. The most generous benefit 
is reserved for vehicles built in—you 
guessed it—union shops. We know the 
labor unions are among some of the 
biggest supporters of our friends on the 
other side of the aisle, and they are set 
to receive their reward. Buyers could 
receive up to a $12,500 tax credit for 
purchasing an electric vehicle from a 
union shop. 
I have nothing against union shops. I 
support people who choose to be part of 
a labor union, but this idea that tax-
payers should have to underwrite a 
benefit that goes exclusively to one 
part of the electric car business, to me, 
is offensive, and it is just unjustified. 
I haven’t seen any evidence either 
that union-made electric vehicles are 
somehow more green than their non-
union-made competitors’, but those 
companies are certain to gain financial 
benefits because of these generous tax-
payer-funded handouts. Wealthy Amer-
icans and Big Labor win; hard-working 
American families not so much. 
Then there is a long list of govern-
ment handouts to make homes more 
energy efficient. Similar to those elec-
tric vehicles, the high cost of retro-
fitting a home makes it infeasible for 
most families—certainly, the middle- 
class families. Outfitting a home with 
solar panels will cost you well over 
$10,000; and, of course, the bigger the 
house, the more the cost. 
The Biden administration is, once 
again, happy to let taxpayers subsidize 
these expenditures. The Democrats’ 
proposals include billions of dollars in 
rebates and grants to help cover the 
cost of retrofitting homes, even for the 
well-to-do, who will be the ones who 
will primarily be able to afford, even 
with these subsidies, this sort of ret-
rofit. 
At the end of the day, the family 
with the means to spend thousands of 
dollars on these products will spend 
less on their monthly electricity bill, 
which I assume is the point, but every-
body else will pay more in taxes with-
out having the benefit of a lower elec-
tricity bill. If our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle get their way, 
monthly electricity prices are likely to 
increase for everyone else. 
As I mentioned, gas prices are up sig-
nificantly from last year. If you filled 
up your pickup truck a year ago, today 
you will find out that you will spend 
about $33 more for each tank of gas 
that you pump. And energy prices for 
homes this winter are expected to go 
up as much as 54 percent. 
These are incredible numbers. This is 
what happens when you throw so much 
money at limited goods and services— 
prices go up; inflation goes up. It is a 
silent tax on people who must pay for 
these goods and services and have no-
where else to turn. 
With this as a backdrop, our Demo-
cratic colleagues have proposed to 
raise taxes on energy companies and 
drive those prices even higher. Now, 
only in a fantasy world can you impose 
greater costs through tax increases on 
a business and not have them trans-
ferred directly to the consumers who 
buy these goods and services. They are 
going to be passed along to the people 
who pay for these goods and services. 
This bill will include a new methane 
tax, which would require oil and gas 
producers to pay hefty fees if they emit 
more methane than the government al-
lows. 
Natural gas accounts for 40 percent 
of our electricity—double the amount 
as renewable sources. Hitting those 
companies with a methane fee and 
other proposed tax hikes isn’t going to 
change the fact that we need natural 
gas to keep the lights on. 
By the way, we need natural gas in 
order to produce the electricity that 
you use to charge your electric vehicle. 
As we hope to move to cleaner forms 
of energy—obviously, coal being the 
one that most of us believe emits the 
most emissions—moving to natural gas 
just makes sense, and as a matter of 
fact, the United States has reduced our 
emissions, not by banning access to 
any particular energy source but by 
producing more natural gas. 
If we need an example of what a nat-
ural gas shortage in America would 
look like, just take a look at Europe. 
The supply shortage has caused elec-
tricity prices in Europe to skyrocket, 
plus the fact that they have banned the 
use of coal and even nuclear power, 
which is emissions-free. But after the 
Fukushima nuclear meltdown and the

tsunami that followed, Europe basi-
cally decided to hang up on any addi-
tional nuclear production. So natural 
gas prices, which are going to sustain 
the greatest demand, will go up about 
600 percent. Since the start of the year, 
they have. The situation is so dire that 
utility companies have switched from 
natural gas and now begin to burn coal 
and fuel oil because they simply don’t 
have access to enough natural gas. 
This is the problem with the push to 
quickly move away from fossil fuels be-
fore we are ready to transition into 
other types of energy sources and when 
you punish the producers of that af-
fordable energy. 
Renewables, as laudable as they are— 
and in Texas, we are an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ State. We produce more elec-
tricity from wind turbines than any 
other State in the Nation. But renew-
ables don’t come close to generating 
enough energy to power our world. 
If the United States and our allies 
scale back production to pursue arbi-
trary 
emission 
benchmarks, 
that 
leaves the world turning to countries 
like Russia and organizations like 
OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, to provide 
that energy. So it is no wonder that 
Russia is a no-show at the U.N. climate 
summit. They are actually the ones 
that will stand to benefit the most if 
other countries eliminate fossil fuels 
from their fuel mix because other 
countries around the world will have 
no choice but to buy more and more 
Russian energy. 
In his remarks yesterday, President 
Biden said we should view the current 
price volatility as a call to action rath-
er than a reason to back off our clean 
energy goals. Well, I disagree. Families 
are being pummeled by high prices 
across the board. We don’t need to in-
crease that burden by driving up costs 
or potentially adding an energy crisis 
to the mix. 
As I said, Texas has always been a 
proud supporter of the ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy strategy. We are often 
recognized for the might of our oil and 
gas sector. But a lot of folks don’t 
know, as I said, that Texas is a leader 
in wind energy. Well, we produce about 
one-quarter of all the wind energy in 
the United States. If we were a coun-
try, we would be the fifth-largest wind 
energy producer in the world. We don’t 
plan on stopping there. We are also 
making serious strides in energy inno-
vation through cutting-edge carbon 
capture and storage projects. 
Texas is proof positive that we can 
strike a balance between conservation, 
productivity, and economic power, and 
you can embrace low-emission energy 
sources without hammering the middle 
class. But those are not the types of 
proposals we see from the tax-and- 
spending spree bill now pending before 
the House of Representatives. This bill 
would simply drive up costs for hard- 
working American families, hurt our 
energy independence, and benefit our 
adversaries. 
This may impress President Biden’s 
peers in Glasgow, but it is sure to fall 
flat with the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
WHISTLEBLOWERS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, dur-
ing my time in the Senate, I have al-
ways tried to honor the work of whis-
tleblowers. Those who speak up about 
government wrongdoing ought to be re-
warded and not sidelined and punished. 
But that is exactly what happened in 
the Indian Health Service according to 
a recently released internal report. 
Now, this goes back a few years, but it 
still is a constant reminder of how 
whistleblowers aren’t listened to and 
bad things happen. 
According to this internal report, in 
August 2006, a Dr. Mark Butterbrodt 
wrote to his superiors about a fellow 
doctor. Over the course of years, he re-
peatedly made extremely serious whis-
tleblower complaints alleging that his 
colleague, a Dr. Stanley Weber, was 
sexually assaulting his young patients. 
He was not alone, because other staff 
tried to report Weber to those at the 
very top. His behavior was described as 
an ‘‘open secret.’’ It is even alleged 
that the standard orientation for new 
nurses included a warning to never 
leave Dr. Weber alone with young boys. 
The response from the Indian Health 
Service senior staff was silence, so the 
crimes continued. Over a decade after 
the first whistleblower report, Dr. 
Weber continued to sexually assault 
young boys who came to the Indian 
Health Service for help. 
Instead of removing the man who had 
been repeatedly, credibly accused of 
sexually abusing his patients, they 
punished the whistleblower. 
Too often in government, we see the 
people who report wrongdoing being 
punished. 
Numerous senior officials broke the 
law by failing to report allegations to 
law enforcement, so the crime could 
continue. Instead, what did they do? 
They promoted Dr. Weber to manage 
those who witnessed his crimes. 
By contrast, the report states that 
Dr. Butterbrodt was ‘‘banished’’—and 
the word ‘‘banished’’ is in quotation 
marks—to the ‘‘very remote and rural 
facility’’ in Belcourt, ND. So the doc-
tor who was the patriotic American, 
reporting crimes, eventually resigned, 
and that was shortly after he was ban-
ished to a very remote and rural facil-
ity. 
This shameful response by the Indian 
Health Service leadership had a direct 
impact on future whistleblowers. If you 
have an environment that discourages 
whistleblowing, what are you going to 
get? Less whistleblowing. 
This 
internal 
report 
states 
that 
‘‘nurses told Dr. Butterbrodt that now 
he could see why they never speak up.’’ 
It is unconscionable that these whis-
tleblowers 
were 
ignored 
and 
a 
pedophile was allowed to act with im-
punity. That is why I recently sent a 
letter to the Acting Director of Indian 
Health Service to ensure that future 
patients and whistleblowers do not face 
the same treatment. I want to make 
sure that processes have been put in 
place so that this doesn’t happen again. 
Dr. Butterbrodt and those like him 
were right to blow the whistle. We need 
to make it easier, not harder, to do the 
right thing. 
There is a pattern about whistle-
blowers. They tend to be treated like 
skunks at a picnic. They usually end 
up doing what is patriotic, only to hurt 
themselves professionally, maybe even 
becoming 
unemployed 
just 
because 
they do what most civil servants want 
to do—just have the government do 
what the law requires or how the 
money is spent according to law. 
So I take the advantage—every time 
a Cabinet person or sub-Cabinet person 
comes to my office for their usual 
interviews before confirmation, I ad-
vise them, whether they run an Agency 
that maybe has 3,000 or 4,000 people to 
an Agency that has—I suppose like the 
Veterans 
Administration, 
which 
I 
think has 400,000 people—you are head 
of that Department. You don’t know 
what is going on by everybody under-
neath you. You should listen to whis-
tleblowers. 
They all assure me that they will, 
but somehow the culture in our govern-
ment doesn’t seem to change. 
ALUMNI FREE SPEECH ALLIANCE 
Mr. President, on another point, I 
have spoken many times about the im-
portance of our First Amendment free-
doms. Our commitment to the open 
discussion of ideas is one reason why 
America has been successful. Unfortu-
nately, it has become increasingly dif-
ficult to have these conversations and 
open discussions in our universities. 
It seems like every week, we hear 
new 
stories 
about 
speakers 
being 
shouted down or new limits being 
placed on academic freedom. That is 
why alumni need to speak up. So my 
remarks today are about an organiza-
tion called the Alumni Free Speech Al-
liance. Anyone who sees a radically dif-
ferent school than they graduated from 
needs to be willing to say so. 
Today, I highlight the work of this 
organization, 
repeating 
their 
name 
again—the Alumni Free Speech Alli-
ance. This group was created by grad-
uates of several colleges who noticed 
that their alma maters were becoming 
more hostile to freedom of speech and 
academic freedom wasn’t being fol-
lowed. The Alumni Free Speech Alli-
ance partnered with organizations of 
alumni at each of their former colleges 
to pool their resources. By working 
with those who support open discourse, 
they hope to make it easier to create 
these alumni groups at more colleges 
and grow the ones that exist.

November 2, 2021 
They are right that alumni are often 
best 
suited 
to 
speak 
out 
about 
illiberalism on our campuses. It is un-
derstandably hard for students and fac-
ulty to speak out about the atmos-
phere of intolerance they live and work 
in. You know they are shamed, embar-
rassed—all of those things that are 
tools that shouldn’t be used in any uni-
versity that brags about academic free-
dom. That is where the alumni come 
in. Alumni can have an outsized voice 
in this atmosphere of lack of tolerance 
at some of our universities. 
This is one reason why I recently 
joined the Senate Campus Free Speech 
Caucus. This Senate caucus aims to 
bring together Members who are inter-
ested in defending the rights of stu-
dents on college campuses. In addition, 
I was proud to cosponsor the campus 
free speech resolution, which urges 
greater First Amendment protection at 
public universities. Just as with pri-
vate alumni, Senators need to be will-
ing to speak out and shine a light when 
students’ rights are being infringed. 
I have heard countless examples of 
universities putting an emphasis on su-
perficial definitions of ‘‘diversity’’ that 
focus only on physical characteristics. 
The benefit of having people from dif-
ferent backgrounds is that they bring 
different viewpoints. But that whole 
concept of diversity is turned on its 
head if only one point of view is ever 
allowed to be spoken. 
Universities do a disservice to their 
students if they just tamp down any 
idea that their loudest activists dis-
agree with. Colleges should be places of 
debate and discussion, not enforced in-
tellectual rigidity. Alumni need to be 
willing to speak out about these issues 
because, too often, people who are on 
that campus can’t. 
My definition of ‘‘university’’ that I 
have used throughout a lifetime is, it is 
a place where controversy runs ramp-
ant. It is a place where we ought to 
have civil discussions, respecting each 
other’s points of view. 
I don’t know how many of my col-
leagues run into what I run into too 
often in Iowa at my town meetings. 
People proudly stand up and say: You 
know, there are two things I never talk 
about—religion and politics. 
Well, if you are a religious person 
and God is going to have an impact on 
your life, why shouldn’t you be willing 
to discuss that? You may be discussing 
it with a Baptist and a Catholic or with 
an atheist and with a Baptist or a 
Christian. Why shouldn’t you be able 
to discuss that in a civil way because it 
is important to your life? 
We all know the role of Big Govern-
ment in our society, and we know the 
principles of representative govern-
ment. Why shouldn’t you be able to 
talk about politics? Republicans or 
Democrats or Socialists and Com-
munists versus conservatives or what-
ever the case might be, you ought to be 
able to disagree in a civil way. It is the 
same way on the university campuses. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
REMEMBERING DENNIS MOORE 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank 
you for recognizing me. I rise this 
afternoon based upon an announcement 
earlier today. I rise in the memory of 
former Kansas Congressman Dennis 
Moore, a man who lived a life of service 
to our Nation. He was a friend, and I 
am sad to hear of his passing today. 
Dennis, above all, was a kind man. 
He was a loving husband to his wife 
Stephene and a doting father and 
grandfather. 
He was born in Anthony, KS, and 
went on to earn degrees from the Uni-
versity of Kansas and then Washburn 
University School of Law. He served 
our country with the U.S. Army Re-
serve and then Kansas for 12 years as 
the Johnson County district attorney. 
He was known for integrity and for a 
strong moral compass, which he car-
ried with him to the Halls of Congress 
when elected in 1998. 
Dennis’s approach to politics was 
one-on-one, person-to-person, and of-
tentimes with his iconic guitar not too 
far out of his reach. It was this per-
sonal approach that paved the way for 
him to be the first Democratic Member 
of Congress from Kansas elected in 
that district in 37 years. As the Kansas 
City Star headlined today in their me-
morial to him, ‘‘Strumming a guitar 
instead of flinging mud’’—doesn’t that 
sound good?—‘‘Strumming a guitar in-
stead of flinging mud, Dennis Moore 
changed Kansas voters’ minds.’’ 
He was a six-term Member, and in 
many ways, we spent those 6 years 
working together. He and I shared that 
period of time, and I have great respect 
for him and the way he served the peo-
ple of the Third District of Kansas. 
That respect for him only grew when 
I witnessed the way he and his wife 
Stephene faced his battle with Alz-
heimer’s with a determination to use 
their experience to help others. They 
made a choice to make this private and 
devastating diagnosis public because 
they knew it would bring awareness to 
the realities of the disease. 
Especially after his diagnosis and for 
as long as he was able, Dennis was a 
tireless advocate for the Alzheimer’s 
Association. In 2018, I was humbled to 
receive an inaugural award in his 
name, the Dennis Moore Alzheimer 
Champion Award, from the Alzheimer’s 
Association of Central and Western 
Kansas. 
He was vocal about what he went 
through and sincere in his urging for 
others having memory problems to see 
their doctor. In his free time, he still 
kept himself busy strumming his gui-
tar at senior centers. 
One area where we always agreed was 
the need to invest in finding a cure for 
Alzheimer’s, and in 2014, Dennis shared 
his experience with this harrowing dis-
ease in front of my Senate Health Ap-
propriations Subcommittee colleagues. 
The executive director of the Kansas 
Alzheimer’s 
Association, 
Fe 
Vorderlandwehr, had this to say about 
Dennis: 
After Congressman Moore was diagnosed 
with Alzheimer’s disease, he became a fierce 
advocate for the Alzheimer’s Association, 
championing the need for an increase in Alz-
heimer’s research with the NIH. He became 
the face of the disease amongst his former 
colleagues in Congress as he testified about 
his battle with Alzheimer’s and the need for 
research to keep other families from going 
through what he was going through. Through 
it all, he kept a wonderful sense of humor 
and his passion for music. 
I leave you with the Congressman’s 
own words, and he said this: 
Alzheimer’s is a bipartisan issue, and I 
urge my former colleagues to unite behind 
it, allotting the necessary resources to fight 
a public health crisis that millions of fami-
lies just like mine are facing. 
Dennis was a genuine, warm, decent 
man who lived an inspiring life that we 
can all learn from. His legacy will be 
the way in which he gave others bat-
tling Alzheimer’s both courage and 
hope. 
Robba and I extend our heartfelt con-
dolences to his children and grand-
children and to Stephanie, his wife, and 
to all of those who knew him. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Wyoming. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. 
On Thursday, President Biden came 
here to Capitol Hill to meet with 
Democrats over in the House. Just 
hours before he got here, economists 
sounded the alarms once again about 
the economy that our Nation is facing 
under President Biden. 
Economic growth slowed to just 2 
percent. Now, this is the slowest it has 
been since the post-pandemic recovery 
began. This was also significantly 
lower than even the experts expected. 
So there was a disconnect. It was real-
ly low and even lower than they ex-
pected. 
Growth is slowing down; hiring is 
slowing down; and shelves are empty 
all across America. We have a growing 
supply chain nightmare. Prices con-
tinue to go up. I heard about it all 
across the State of Wyoming this past 
weekend. 
So what did President Biden do in re-
sponse? 
Well, he ignored the alarm bells. He 
gave his blessing to the latest version 
of this reckless tax-and-spending bill. 
And the new version looks a lot like 
the old version—just as radical, just as 
reckless, and just as unpopular with 
the American public. There is nothing 
really new in the bill except more 
budget gimmicks. 
And it is interesting that NBC News, 
this weekend, came out with a poll 
that only 22 percent—only about one in 
five Americans think that, under Joe 
Biden and the Democrats, the country 
is on the right path. Seventy-one per-
cent said we are on the wrong path.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7590 
November 2, 2021 
And the bill that is being proposed by 
the Democrats is still about 2,500 pages 
long and still contains the worst parts 
of the old bill. 
So what is in the new one? 
Well, here are a couple of things. It 
still supersizes the IRS. This new bill 
would still give the Internal Revenue 
Service $80 billion to hire an army of 
IRS agents. Now, Democrats know this 
is unpopular, yet they continue to de-
fend the proposal. 
Why would that be? 
The American people have spoken 
out. They complained to Congress. 
Democrats don’t seem to care. That is 
because Democrats need to squeeze 
working Americans for more of the 
hard-earned money they make. 
Why do they want it? 
So the Democrats can spend it. 
What do they want to spend it on? 
Well, the largest part of this bill has 
to do with energy. It would spend half 
a trillion dollars for parts of the Green 
New Deal. That includes over $2.5 bil-
lion for something they call tree eq-
uity. 
It still includes enormous handouts 
to people who buy electric luxury vehi-
cles. Now, we already give billions and 
billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidy 
to electric vehicle makers and owners. 
This would be even more. 
Studies show 80 percent of these sub-
sidies go to households making more 
than $100,000 each. Well, Democrats say 
that is not enough. This bill still would 
give $12,500 to couples making up to 
$800,000 a year to buy luxury electric 
vehicles. 
The bill still includes the $1,500 pay-
outs to people who buy electric bicy-
cles. It is a mystery to me how electric 
bicycles can be better for the environ-
ment than regular bicycles. They are 
obviously not. It just shows that this 
policy is really not about the environ-
ment; it is about payoffs to Democrat 
elites in the big cities. 
That is why the bill still includes the 
Civilian Climate Corps. Now, this is an 
army of full-time, taxpayer-funded cli-
mate activists. They would get paid 
generous stipends and salaries. And 
what would they get paid to do? To 
protest American energy projects. 
Now, just last week, climate pro-
testers stopped traffic in New York 
City during rush hour. People were just 
trying to get to work or get home, just 
trying to take their kids to school, yet 
they had to sit in traffic because of 
professional protesters, and this ad-
ministration wants to hire up to a mil-
lion of them. 
Now, Democrats know this isn’t pop-
ular. That is why they changed the 
name of the Climate Corps in the new 
bill. They didn’t change the purpose. 
Now they are trying to call it the Land 
Corps. It sounds like a harmless group. 
It is the same civilian climate army, a 
green army to attack American oil, 
gas, and coal. 
Now, this name change alone is an 
admission that this idea is very un-
popular. Democrats know the Amer-
ican people don’t want to spend billions 
of dollars to subsidize protesters. 
A recent poll found 90 percent of 
Americans are unwilling to pay more 
than $100 a year to fight climate 
change. We are already paying more 
than $1,000 a year in energy costs to 
drive and to heat our homes due to Joe 
Biden’s energy policies. This is $1,000 
more than we did last year. 
At home this past weekend in Wyo-
ming, I noted and talked to folks while 
I was filling up that gas is a dollar a 
gallon higher than it was when Joe 
Biden took office. Natural gas prices 
have doubled, and that means a lot be-
cause half of the families in America 
use natural gas to power their homes. 
This bill also increases taxes on 
American energy production. Demo-
crats specifically target a new tax on 
natural gas production. So this would 
raise taxes and prices significantly— 
even higher—for American families 
who already this winter are facing a 7- 
year high in the cost of natural gas and 
are already trying to decide this winter 
are they going to be able to heat or to 
eat. That is becoming a concern of fam-
ilies all across America under Joe 
Biden’s agenda and economy. 
One in five American families have 
already cut their spending to pay for 
their energy bills this year. The Amer-
ican public and people are paying too 
much for Joe Biden’s energy agenda. 
They don’t want to pay a penny more. 
They are tired of it, fed up. 
Democrats know their agenda is un-
popular with the American public. 
That is why this bill would also perma-
nently change the makeup of the coun-
try, because the new version of the bill 
would give amnesty for millions upon 
millions of illegal immigrants. The 
Parliamentarian has said Democrats 
couldn’t pass amnesty in the last 
version of the bill, yet Democrats want 
amnesty so badly they are going to try 
it all over again. Apparently, version C 
is coming soon. 
This is supposed to be a spending bill, 
not an immigration bill. If they want 
to do an immigration bill, they ought 
to introduce an immigration bill. Yet 
Democrats know that they don’t have 
the votes to pass the kind of immigra-
tion bill that they want to pass—not at 
a time when we have a flood of illegal 
immigrants coming across the south-
ern border, with more on the way. 
So they are trying to cram it into 
this spending bill. They are hoping 
that the American public won’t notice. 
If Democrats have their way, this 
would be the most consequential immi-
gration bill in half a century. The bill 
would give millions of illegal immi-
grants amnesty and then give them 
plenty of taxpayer money because this 
bill includes new permanent welfare 
programs with no work requirements— 
none at all—and no citizenship require-
ments. That is what the Democrats are 
proposing. 
It is no wonder that we have a border 
crisis at our southern border, a flood of 
illegal immigrants. With this bill, 
Democrats are promising amnesty, as 
well as free childcare, free preschool, 
and even free college to illegal immi-
grants. This is in addition to the $300 
checks they already sent to illegal im-
migrants with the spending bill that 
the Democrats passed along party-line 
votes in March. 
Democrats seem to do everything 
that they can to reward illegal immi-
gration. The Wall Street Journal re-
ports the Biden administration now 
wants to give millions of dollars to 
families who came here illegally in 2018 
and were detained for illegal entry. The 
number being reported is that the 
Biden administration wants to give 
them $450,000 a person. 
Now, this is more than six times the 
annual income of a typical American 
family, Mr. President. It is more than 
50 times the per-capita income of El 
Salvador. $450,000 per person will mean 
millions upon millions of taxpayer dol-
lars for families who came here ille-
gally. You talk about an incentive for 
people to come here illegally—this is 
exhibit A. The total payout could be 
more than a billion dollars. 
Now, let me just contrast that num-
ber of $450,000 with the fact that those 
who lose their lives defending the coun-
try, like a marine—a young marine 
from Wyoming, Rylee McCollum, who 
was one of the 13 killed in Kabul, Af-
ghanistan—the United States sends to 
those families $100,000, and Joe Biden is 
promising 41⁄2 times that much for peo-
ple who came here illegally. 
Mr. President, the Democrats say 
this is a new bill. It is the same old 
Democrat agenda: high energy costs, 
amnesty for illegal immigrants, wel-
fare and payoffs to wealthy donors. 
And this is the bill endorsed by the 
President of the United States. It is no 
wonder that 71 percent of Americans 
this past weekend said this country is 
heading in the wrong direction. It is 
the wrong direction under the Demo-
crats and under Joe Biden. 
Democrats ought to listen to the 
American people. People are furious 
with this administration. Listen to the 
sirens blaring with the poor economic 
numbers reported last week. It is time 
to stop making the Biden economy 
even worse. It is time to stop the 
freefall. Stop this reckless tax and 
spending before the administration 
does even further damage to our econ-
omy and our country. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

NET). The Senator from Kansas.

to be that they were things that I 
would never expect to be true. And

often that has been the case over the 
years. You hear something from a con-
stituent or read in the paper or see on 
the internet, and it is like, this can’t 
be true. 
And the one that stands out to me 
this week is this intention by the De-
partments of Justice, Homeland Secu-
rity, and Health and Human Services 
to pay up to $450,000 per person of fami-
lies who illegally crossed our border 
and were detained separately. 
This is an absurd policy decision. It 
gives greater incentives for people to 
come to the United States and make 
that dangerous trek to our border. How 
can it be fair to our law-abiding Amer-
ican citizens? 
This is a situation that makes no 
sense to me. And it is something that 
the Biden administration ought to im-
mediately reject as out of bounds for 
commonsense and good judgment and, 
certainly, something that is damaging 
to the ability for us to have a lawful, 
sovereign border, and something that 
is very damaging to the citizens of this 
country but also to those who make 
the humanitarian challenge of trav-
eling through Central America and 
Mexico to our sponsor border. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to seek unanimous consent 
for eight to nine nominees to critical 
State Department posts. 
Each of them moved through the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
with bipartisan support, and the only 
reason the Senate has not confirmed 
them is due to the political obstinacy 
of a couple of my Republican col-
leagues. And the evidence of that is 
that when we have a vote, as we had 
earlier today for the Assistant Admin-
istrator of AID, it passed 59 to 40—59 to 
40. 
We have heard many complaints 
about the management of the State De-
partment and the conduct of U.S. for-
eign policy in recent months. And 
while the State Department is not a 
perfect institution—for that fact, no 
institution is—its leadership was deci-
mated by the prior administration. 
The assistant secretaries and ambas-
sadors who should be participating in 
the rebuilding of the institution and 
the development and implementation 
of U.S. foreign policy are instead lan-
guishing on the Senate floor—dozens, 
dozens. 
Nominees who should be the face of 
the United States at international or-
ganizations—like the United Nations, 
NATO, the Organization for Security 
and Co-operation in Europe—are in-
stead waiting for the Senate to act. 
The government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China is watching. Even though 
the majority of this body has recog-
nized that the Government of China 
represents the greatest geopolitical 
challenge to the United States, we are 
letting China eat our lunch on the 
world stage. 
Our Republican colleagues have spo-
ken at length in opposition to this ad-
ministration’s handling of the situa-
tion in Afghanistan, but they refuse to 
allow the Senate to vote on nominees 
who are critical to dealing with the ref-
ugee situation resulting from the U.S. 
withdrawal and the much-needed sta-
bilization efforts. 
By the way, a withdrawal that was 
already precooked by the Trump ad-
ministration when it made a surrender 
deal with the Taliban that said we will 
leave on a date certain, we will release 
thousands of Taliban prisoners—which 
they did, to the Taliban, who became 
fighting soldiers—we ultimately will 
not only leave at a date certain, but we 
have done nothing to get any of the 
promises that the Taliban made en-
forced, and we reduce our troop level 
dramatically. That is what President 
Biden inherited. 
Now, I have heard a lot about the 
handling of the situation in Afghani-
stan, but my colleagues refuse to allow 
the Senate to vote on nominees who 
are critical to dealing with the refugee 
situation resulting from that with-
drawal and the much-needed stabiliza-
tion efforts. 
Nominees being held by the Repub-
licans include the Assistant Secretary 
of State for Population, Refugees, and 
Migration; and the Assistant Secretary 
for Conflict and Stabilization Oper-
ations. That cannot stand. 
And for all the talk of needing to 
work with our allies and partners, how 
does holding our nominee to be the 
U.S. Ambassador to Israel or the U.S. 
Ambassador to Canada actually ad-
vance U.S. interests? 
It does not. It is seriously detri-
mental to our national security. 
Before I ask unanimous consent, I 
understand Senator SCHUMER
would 
like to speak prior to these UC re-
quests. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, thank 
you. I have some brief remarks, and I 
want to thank my friend, the Senator 
from New Jersey, who will move in a 
few moments to have this Chamber ap-
prove a number of critical nominees for 
our national security and is going to 
be, shamefully, blocked. 
He has been a great fighter not only 
for these men and women, but on for-
eign policy in general, one of the great 
leaders. And his passion for this issue 
comes from a desire to have us have 
the 
greatest 
strength 
abroad 
dip-
lomatically and geopolitically as well. 
So I cannot thank him enough.

the government, the most important is

protecting the American people from 
threats foreign or domestic. To do so, 
the President relies on an army of dedi-
cated public servants—our expert Am-
bassadors, Diplomats, Under Secre-
taries, and Assistant Secretaries, who 
play a critical role in our government. 
But for months, Senate Republicans 
have gone to great lengths to place 
pointless holds on over 100 of these 
nominees. The consequence is scores of 
empty desks in the State Department 
and in our Embassies and the Depart-
ment of the Treasury and other Agen-
cies. 
These nominees are not controver-
sial. They are routinely confirmed by 
consent in this Chamber, until a few 
people decided that they wanted to 
make a big show of this for whatever 
reason. No one ever did this before. No 
one ever did this—maybe one indi-
vidual nominee here or there, but not 
all of the nominees. It is so risky to 
the security of the United States. 
By this point in the Trump adminis-
tration, for instance, both sides worked 
together to confirm 32 Ambassadors by 
voice vote. Most of us didn’t like the 
Trump administration or the people he 
was appointing, but we had enough in-
tegrity, enough faith in the future of 
this country and the strength of this 
country not to let politics enter into 
what had been routine decisions. 
Right 
now, 
Republican 
obstruc-
tionism has meant only four nominees 
have been agreed to. So the bottom 
line is—let me be clear—Republicans 
who are holding up these nominees are 
endangering 
our 
national 
security, 
making it harder for our country to re-
spond to threats at home and abroad. 
We hear a lot of talk about national 
security on the other side, but what it 
comes down to is that they are pre-
venting 32 State Department nominees 
and 10 Defense Department nominees 
for quick confirmation. That is wrong, 
and I would hope that they would think 
about it and let these fine people go 
through the way that has been done 
under Democratic and Republican ad-
ministrations in the past. 
Mr. President, of all the mandates of 
government, the most important is 
protecting the American people from 
all threats, foreign and domestic. To do 
so, the President relies on an army of 
dedicated public servants: our expert 
diplomats, ambassadors, Under Secre-
taries, and Assistant Secretaries who 
play a critical role in our government. 
But for months, some Senate Repub-
licans have gone to great lengths to 
place pointless holds on over 100 of 
these nominees. The consequence has 
been scores of empty desks in the State 
Department, in our embassies, in the 
Department of the Treasury and count-
less other agencies. 
These nominees are not controver-
sial; they are routinely confirmed by 
consent in this Chamber. By this point 
in the Trump Administration, both 
sides worked together to confirm 32 
ambassadors by voice vote. But right 
now, Republican obstruction has meant 
only four such nominees have been 
agreed to. 
Let me be clear: Republicans who are 
holding up these nominees are endan-
gering our national security and mak-
ing it harder for our country to respond 
to threats at home and abroad. 
Our Republican counterparts always 
like to talk a good game on national 
security concerns, but when it comes 
down to it they are preventing 32 State 
Department nominees and at least 10 
Department of Defense nominees from 
quick confirmation. All of these are ca-
reer national security professionals 
who are eager to return to public serv-
ice and project American strength 
abroad. 
This is not how the Senate normally 
works to process these dedicated public 
servants. Indeed, a number of our col-
leagues on the other side have com-
plained that the Senate is taking up a 
lot of time processing these individ-
uals. 
If Republicans take issue with the 
amount of time we are taking, they 
should speak with their own members 
who are directly prolonging the process 
through their obstruction. Republicans 
could decide right now to allow these 
nominees to go by consent. 
This Chamber, under this leadership, 
is not tolerating a few Members who 
want to muck up the confirmation 
process just to make a scene. 
In the weeks and months to come we 
are going to work through these nomi-
nees as long as it takes. I hope that our 
Republican 
colleagues 
immediately 
drop their objections and give Presi-
dent Biden the officials he needs in 
place to keep the American people safe. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, with 
that hope, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the consid-
eration of the following nomination: 
Calendar 
No. 
239, 
Michele 
Jeanne 
Sison, of Maryland, a Career Member 
of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of 
Career Ambassador, to be an Assistant 
Secretary of State (International Orga-
nization Affairs); that the nomination 
be confirmed; the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. I understand 
that multiple of my colleagues have 
objections to all of the nominees that 
the Senator from New Jersey is going 
to offer this evening. So I will be here 
to object on their behalf and also on 
my own behalf with regard to a few of 
them. 
Mr. President, I want to address one 
of those nominees, Julianne Smith, the 
President’s 
nominee 
to 
be 
United 
States Ambassador to NATO. This is a 
nominee to whom I object myself, and 
I want to explain why, briefly. 
Before I do that, however, I just have 
to make one comment on the Senate 
majority leader’s remarks about his 
own inability to get these nominees 
confirmed. 
Now, I agree that many of these 
nominees are important, and that is, in 
fact, one of the reasons we should have 
a vote on them. The Ambassador to 
NATO, for instance, as I am about to 
argue, is a very important position. 
And the positions that she takes, the 
arguments that she makes are very im-
portant, which is why we ought to go 
on the record and actually have a vote. 
But the Senate majority leader’s 
comments—as if he has no control over 
the calendar. He is the majority leader 
of the United States Senate. He decides 
when we vote. He decides what we vote 
on. 
What are we doing now? 
The floor is empty. We could be vot-
ing. 
What are we doing later this week? 
He is gavelling us out of session so 
that Members across the aisle can go 
on a field trip to Glasgow, Scotland. 
We could be voting. 
It is getting a little rich to hear the 
Senate majority leader, who is doing 
almost nothing—have we brought up 
the defense bill? 
No action. Multiple major issues—no 
action from the Senate majority lead-
er. 
If these nominees are so critical, he 
ought to be putting them on the floor 
for votes. He doesn’t want to do that 
because, apparently, he can’t control 
the floor or he just doesn’t want to 
work for very long or he doesn’t want 
to work very hard. I mean, I leave that 
to him. But it is quite ridiculous for 
the majority leader to blame Repub-
licans, who cannot prevent votes. 
Can I just be clear? Republicans do 
not have the ability to prevent votes 
on any of these nominees. The fili-
buster for these nominees doesn’t exist. 
We can vote whenever the majority 
leader wants. It is his decision when to 
bring them to the floor. 
Now I want to comment on one just 
briefly. On Julianne Smith—one nomi-
nee tonight to whom I object—this is 
the President’s nominee, as I said a 
moment ago, to be the next United 
States Ambassador to NATO. 
I think the Senator from New Jersey 
and I can agree that this is a very im-
portant position. I am sure the Senator 
believes that, and I agree with him 100 
percent. And I just want to take a 
minute and say why I think it is im-
portant and why we need to vote—actu-
ally vote—on her nomination. 
A decade ago almost, 2014, after the 
Russian 
invasion—incursion 
into 
Ukraine, NATO allies finally recog-
nized that they were not spending 
enough—our 
NATO 
allies—on 
their 
own defense and on our common de-
fense. So they pledged as a group to 
commit at least 2 percent of their re-
spective GDPs to their own defense and 
to meet that target by 2024. So far, 
large numbers of them are not on track 
to do so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7593 
November 2, 2021 
In fact, Ms. Smith said, in response 
to my own questions about this, that it 
is clear that a group of allies will fail 
to deliver on this pledge by 2024; and, 
currently, another group are not close 
to meeting it, although they say they 
hope to make up the difference. 
Here is my point: The security situa-
tion has not improved since 2014. It has 
deteriorated. Russia, as we speak, is 
still menacing Ukraine. And now China 
is menacing Taiwan. 
The United States is already facing 
hard choices, and we are going to face 
harder choices yet about how we allo-
cate our defense resources, which are 
scarce; how we allocate our force pos-
ture, how we structure our force pos-
ture in a world that is growing more 
dangerous. And the China threat, in 
particular, is one that is going to make 
us make difficult choices in what we 
prioritize in the Asia-Pacific versus 
what we prioritize in Europe. 
The bottom line is we need our allies 
to meet not only their 2-percent com-
mitment, but we need them to do more 
in Europe for their own defense because 
we must focus on the deteriorating se-
curity situation in the Indo-Pacific and 
in the Asia-Pacific with regard to 
China and its imperial ambitions in 
Taiwan. 
I asked Ms. Smith for her commit-
ment that she will press our NATO al-
lies not only to meet their 2-percent 
commitment, but to revise that com-
mitment so that we can have a truly 
common defense in this era of multi-
plying challenges and deteriorating se-
curity. She has refused, unfortunately, 
to give me that commitment. 
I can’t block her nomination, but I 
can ask that we take a vote on it. And 
so for that reason, in a moment here, 
when Senator MENENDEZ
brings her 
nomination to the floor, I will object 
and ask for a vote on her, in particular; 
and I will, as I said, object to others on 
behalf of my colleagues. With those 
comments, on behalf of my colleagues 
and myself, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. It is disingenuous 
to suggest that this can all happen by 
the majority leader and 60 votes. There 
were no calls when Republicans con-
trolled this Chamber for votes on each 
and every nominee. On the contrary, as 
the leader said, large numbers of 
Trump nominees to the State Depart-
ment or Ambassadorial or State De-
partment positions were passed on 
voice. They were passed on voice vote. 
I don’t know. In the case of NATO, I 
think the nominee made it very clear 
before the committee—I know that our 
colleague is not a member of that par-
ticular committee—but she made it 
very clear before the committee that 
she was advocating for all of our allies 
to reach their 2-percent commitment. 
And what better way to achieve it 
than to actually have an Ambassador 
at NATO to pursue that goal? 
But if you don’t have anybody there, 
guess what. You can’t pursue that goal. 
So let me try again. 
I want to ask that it be in order to 
make the same request with respect to 
Executive Calendar No. 327, Anne A. 
Witkowsky, of Maryland, to be an As-
sistant Secretary of State (Conflict and 
Stabilization Operations). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of my colleagues and myself, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. So we will continue 
to have conflict and stabilization with-
out anybody being be in charge. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 318, Christopher P. Lu, of 
Virginia, to be Representative of the 
United States of America to the United 
Nations for U.N. Management and Re-
form, with the rank of Ambassador. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of my colleagues, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Here is an example. 
We hear we want reform at the U.N., 
but we can’t put the person there in 
charge of helping us reform the U.N. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 462, Julieta Valls Noyes, 
of Virginia, a Career Member of the 
Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career 
Minister, to be an Assistant Secretary 
of State (Population, Refugees, and Mi-
gration). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of my colleagues and myself, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. All right. I heard a 
lot of my colleagues talk about how we 
should get more SIV people from Af-
ghanistan. This is the person who could 
help us do it. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 437, Julianne Smith, of 
Michigan, to be United States Perma-
nent Representative on the Council of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, with the rank and status of Am-
bassador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Pleni-
potentiary. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask that it be in 
order to make the same request with 
respect to Calendar No. 461, Marcia 
Stephens Bloom Bernicat, of New Jer-
sey, a Career Member of the Senior 
Foreign Service, Class of the Minister- 
Counselor, to be Director General of 
the Foreign Service. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of my colleagues and myself, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I can’t wait to hear 
the next objection to someone who 
would be Ambassador to Israel—to 
Israel. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 452, Thomas R. Nides, of 
Minnesota, to be Ambassador Extraor-
dinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to the State 
of Israel. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of my colleagues, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. So we will have no 
Ambassador in Israel as we deal with 
the challenges of Iran and others in the 
region. It is mind-boggling, all of those 
who get up here and talk about our 
ally, the State of Israel, the impor-
tance of the State of Israel, but we 
won’t have an Ambassador there to 
help us meet the challenges that Israel 
has. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 443, Michael Carpenter, of 
the District of Columbia, to be U.S. 
Representative to the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
with the rank of Ambassador. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of my colleagues, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, let’s see if we 
get a lucky one. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion: Executive Calendar No. 453, David 
L. Cohen, of Pennsylvania, to be Am-
bassador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Pleni-
potentiary of the United States of 
America to Canada; that the Senate 
vote on confirmation of the nomina-
tion; that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
David L. Cohen, of Pennsylvania, to be 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Pleni-
potentiary of the United States of 
America to Canada. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nomination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7594 
November 2, 2021 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Cohen nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, since 
the Democratic leadership and the 
Biden administration first proposed the 
massive 
tax-and-spend 
legislation 
called reconciliation 7 weeks ago, I 
have come to the floor every week to 
explain what is in this massive tax- 
and-spend proposal and why I believe it 
is wrong for the economy at a time of 
high inflation, low economic growth, 
and record levels of debt. 
Before I talk about that, though, I 
think it is important to consider where 
we have been, how things could be bet-
ter. Before the pandemic began, back 
in February of 2020—largely thanks to 
commonsense, pro-growth tax reform 
that was passed in 2017 by Republicans 
here in the Congress and the Trump ad-
ministration—we 
had 
one 
of 
the 
strongest economies we had ever seen. 
We had 19 straight months, in February 
of 2020, of wage growth over 3 percent 
on an annual basis—19 straight months 
of wage growth, real wage growth, 
above inflation—by the way, most of it 
benefiting lower and middle-income 
Americans. 
We had the lowest poverty rate in the 
history of our country since we started 
keeping track of it back in the 1950s. 
Blacks and Hispanics had the lowest 
unemployment rate ever. Overall, we 
had the lowest unemployment rate in 
50 years. It was an opportunity econ-
omy. We need to get back to that. 
Then, of course, as everyone remem-
bers, we had to deal with the effects of 
COVID–19, including shutting down 
much of the economy. Luckily, we now 
have vaccines that are making it pos-
sible for us to return to a relatively 
normal lifestyle. 
But there is one big problem. While 
the pandemic is finally starting to 
fade, the economy is being seriously 
challenged by extremely high inflation. 
Don’t take my word for it. Here is 
what the data says. The latest Con-
sumer Price Index jumped to one of the 
largest increases in 13 years, to 5.4 per-
cent. That means people are paying 
more for everything. The latest Pro-
ducer Price Index went up too. That 
means the folks who produce the goods 
are paying more to put them on the 
shelf. 
Real wages are actually down be-
cause, adjusted for inflation, wages are 
down by an average of 1.7 percent dur-
ing the Biden administration. So peo-
ple back home tell me: I got a wage 
gain, Rob, but I am not feeling it be-
cause inflation is eating up all the gain 
I got. 
Wage increases may be out there, but 
they are not above inflation. The re-
sponse by Washington has been unprec-
edented, what is called stimulus spend-
ing. It is like adding fuel to the fire. 
Stimulus spending at a time when de-
mand was already increasing and the 
economy was already rebounding has 
been a recipe for inflation, and that is 
exactly what has happened. 
Unfortunately, contrary to what the 
White House has said—which is that 
this is going to be transitory, in other 
words, temporary—it looks like it is 
here to stay for a while. And middle- 
class families, of course, are feeling the 
squeeze. 
We are paying 42 percent more at the 
pump—42 percent higher this year than 
last year. It now costs almost a hun-
dred bucks to fill up a pickup truck. I 
know that because I filled up mine in 
Ohio recently—$85. 
I just can’t believe that, here in Con-
gress, we are thinking about passing 
additional legislation to make infla-
tion even worse. Everything is up. Nat-
ural gas is expected to rise in that 40 
percent range, just as the winter heat-
ing season kicks into high gear. And it 
is not just fuel costs. It is groceries. It 
is furniture. It is everything. 
Thanksgiving is just around the cor-
ner. Here is the report from the New 
York Times. And I read their lead: 
‘‘Thanksgiving 2021 could be the most 
expensive meal in the history of the 
holiday.’’ 
They are saying that because every-
thing has gone up. The cost of turkeys 
has gone up double digits, the cost of 
pumpkin pie, the cost of everything 
that people are having to buy for 
Thanksgiving. 
Unfortunately, the actions of this 
Democratic Congress are a big part, 
again, of why this inflation is so high. 
Back at the beginning of the year, 
Democrats passed a $1.9 trillion COVID 
relief bill that mostly did not deal with 
COVID, but it did provide the most 
stimulus spending to our economy ever 
in the history of the Congress. This 
stimulus spending essentially primed 
the pump on an economy that was al-
ready recovering nicely. 
Multiple nonpartisan groups, includ-
ing the Congressional Budget Office 
here on Capitol Hill, told us that the 
economy was improving already. In 
fact, CBO said that the economy was 
recovering and it would recover to its 
prepandemic levels by midyear. That 
was by June 30 of this year. Many of us 
tried to warn that if we overheated the 
economy, spent more money to prime 
that pump, that it would result in 
more inflation. 
And it wasn’t just Republicans. Larry 
Summers, who served as Treasury Sec-
retary under President Clinton and 
served as National Economic Adviser 
for President Obama, basically said 
that. He warned that injecting so much 
money into the economy would lead to 
inflation. And, of course, it is lower in-
come and middle-income Americans 
who get hurt the worst. 
It is basically a hidden tax. As I men-
tioned earlier, the annual inflation 
rate last month was 5.4 percent, but ev-
erything I am seeing is double-digit in-
flation this year compared to last year. 
But if your wage rate is below that, if 
your wage increase is below that— 
maybe you received a 3-percent wage 
increase—it is actually going to be 
harder for you to be able to afford what 
you need for you and your family. 
In other words, not too long after we 
enjoyed a record stretch of wage 
growth, prepandemic, that primarily 
benefited 
lower 
and 
middle-income 
workers, we are now seeing just the op-
posite: a pay cut for everyday Ameri-
cans. 
What do we need to do to address 
this? Well, stop the stimulus spending 
because that is helping to fuel this in-
flation. 
There are two major bills that Con-
gress is considering right now. One 
would help, and one would make mat-
ters worse. 
What are they? 
Well, the first is the bipartisan infra-
structure bill. It passed the Senate in 
early August with significant bipar-
tisan support. That is unusual around 
here, particularly for a bill as signifi-
cant as this, but we worked to ensure 
that the bill was one that both sides 
could support. 
And it makes too much sense for it 
not to become law. It will help fix our 
Nation’s crumbling infrastructure. It 
will fix our roads, our bridges, our rail 
systems, and our ports, which are par-
ticularly important right now given 
the supply chain issues that our coun-
try is experiencing. 
It will also help upgrade our digital 
infrastructure. High-sped internet will 
now be available to kids so they can 
learn, 
so 
people 
can 
get 
their 
healthcare online, so people who want 
to start a business can do so. It will 
boost our Nation’s ability to provide 
that kind of high-speed broadband, par-
ticularly in our rural areas. 
Importantly, 
thoughtful, 
conserv-
ative economists like Michael Strain 
at the American Enterprise Institute 
and Douglas Holtz-Eakin at the Amer-
ican Action Forum will tell you that 
this bipartisan infrastructure bill is 
counterinflationary; in other words, it 
will push back against inflation. Why? 
Because it adds to the supply side of 
our economy, as they will say. It con-
tributes to our Nation’s long-term 
growth because it makes long-term in-
vestment in hard assets. Think of that 
bridge in your State or your commu-
nity that needs to be fixed. That spend-
ing won’t happen in the next year, but 
it will happen over 5, 10, maybe 15 
years, and it will lead to a more effi-
cient and productive economy. 
It also will make us more competi-
tive 
against 
countries 
like 
China, 
which currently spends more than four 
times as much as we do on infrastruc-
ture as a percent of their GDP. Why? 
Because they want to get ahead. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill 
also has no tax increases. Let me re-
peat that. Unlike the second bill we are 
going to talk about, the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill has no tax increases 
on the economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7595 
November 2, 2021 
It is no surprise that polling data 
from CBS News, CNBC, and others 
shows that the vast majority of Ameri-
cans—in this case, 87 percent in these 
two polls—support investing in and im-
proving our infrastructure. 
For these reasons, the House of Rep-
resentatives needs to pass this bill 
without delay and help us achieve this 
win for the American people. It has 
been almost 3 months since the legisla-
tion passed here in the U.S. Senate—al-
most 3 months. It passed by a vote of 69 
to 30. 
It is now being held up by progres-
sives in the House of Representatives 
who want the second bill—the massive 
tax-and-spend bill, the reconciliation 
bill—more than they want the infra-
structure bill. So they are holding the 
infrastructure bill hostage, thinking 
that somehow that will enable them to 
get more moderate Democrats to sup-
port the massive tax-and-spend bill. I 
don’t think that is going to happen, 
but, meanwhile, they are hurting the 
American people by holding it hostage. 
The second bill that Democrats are 
contemplating, which is the reconcili-
ation bill, a massive tax-and-spend bill, 
would inject at least $2 trillion more in 
largely stimulus funding into an al-
ready overheated economy. In order to 
try to pay for it, it also includes sig-
nificant tax increases that will hurt 
economic growth and jobs. 
Democrats claim they are taxing the 
rich and corporations to pay for it, but 
we shouldn’t be fooled. The middle 
class will bear the brunt of what they 
are proposing, as they always do. 
As an example, the proposed Medi-
care surcharge on active investment 
income will hit the millions of small 
businesses that structured themselves 
as pass-through entities, as the vast 
majority do, with an across-the-board 
3.8-percent increase on all income. 
Proposed corporate tax increases will 
hit American workers, based on the 
analyses of the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office and the non-
partisan Joint Committee on Taxation. 
It is very simple. When you tax a com-
pany, the workers end up taking the 
brunt of it. About 70 percent of the 
benefit of the tax cuts and about 70 
percent of the detriment of the tax in-
creases goes to worker wages and bene-
fits. Costs will be passed down to work-
ing families in the form of even lower 
wages and even more inflation, which 
means higher prices for everything. 
That is bad for the families that I 
represent. Any objective analysis will 
show that this massive tax-and-spend 
bill will actually cost a lot more than 
advertised. 
Why do I say that? Because it uses 
some budget gimmicks to be able to 
make the cost of the bill look like less. 
Based on a new study that just came 
out by the Penn Wharton folks, if ben-
efit programs put in place by the bill— 
let’s say the child tax credit—increase 
and are not sunset in the 10-year win-
dow, then the cost goes from $1.75 tril-
lion to $3.98 trillion. In other words, if 
you just assume that we are not going 
to sunset things like the child tax cred-
it, the cost goes to almost $4 trillion. 
Democrats are proposing to end these 
new benefits partway through their 10- 
year window to help keep the costs 
down, knowing full well that, histori-
cally, benefit programs like this are 
not ended but always extended. 
So, taking away the budget gim-
micks, the cost of this massive tax- 
and-spend bill gets it closer to $4 tril-
lion. By the way, that is more than 
twice as much as Congress has ever 
spent on a spending bill in the history 
of our country. 
I strongly urge President Biden and 
Democrats in Congress to slow down 
this process at a time of high inflation, 
record debt, and consider the dev-
astating 
economic 
consequences 
of 
what they are proposing. This in-
creased spending, combined with job- 
killing tax increases, could lead to the 
kind of stagflation, as they called it, 
that we had back in the 1970s: low 
growth, high interest rates, high infla-
tion. We never want to go back there. 
Yet, if we don’t change course, we 
could be heading in that direction. 
Here is a better solution. Just pass 
the right bill: the bipartisan, pro- 
growth infrastructure bill that has 
been stuck in the House of Representa-
tives for almost 3 months. President 
Biden has said he will sign it into law. 
It would be a victory for the American 
people. 
Stop holding it hostage. Instead of 
holding it hostage, do something good 
for our infrastructure, which everyone 
relies on—good for our economy, good 
for American families, and good for the 
country right now. 
As we approach the Thanksgiving 
holiday, it would be a needed bipar-
tisan victory for which all of us—Re-
publican and Democrat alike—could 
give thanks. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF ISOBEL COLEMAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise today to express my enthusiastic 
support for the nomination of Ambas-
sador Isobel Coleman to be Deputy Ad-
ministrator for Policy and Program-
ming at the United States Agency for 
International Development. 
As the world faces mounting chal-
lenges—from 
climate 
change, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, forced migration 
spurred by conflict, lack of economic 
opportunity, and growing food insecu-
rity, to the emergence of antidemo-
cratic 
and 
authoritarian 
leaders— 
USAID’s work is critically important 
to the U.S. national security and glob-
al stability. 
I am pleased to be supporting Ambas-
sador Coleman’s nomination, and I am 
confident that her extensive develop-
ment experience and her years of dis-
tinguished public service, including at 
the United Nations, serving with Ad-
ministrator Power, provide her with 
the type of background and knowledge 
required to address the challenges 
ahead, if confirmed. She is a well- 
known and trusted foreign affairs pro-
fessional, and I am confident she will 
execute her duties with distinction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7596 
November 2, 2021 
The fact that Ambassador Coleman’s 
nomination, someone whose leadership 
is so essential, has languished on the 
Senate floor for almost 3 months is a 
travesty. 
I urge my colleagues to support her 
nomination and make sure that this 
critical position is filled without fur-
ther delay.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MONTINE MCNULTY 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to applaud the CEO of the 
Arkansas 
Hospitality 
Association, 
Montine McNulty, who will be retiring 
at the end of this year. 
During this very challenging time for 
the hospitality industry, McNulty per-
severed through all of the difficulties 
that transpired amid the COVID–19 
pandemic. When small businesses were 
shutting down and people were taking 
early retirements, McNulty decided to 
postpone retirement to help Arkansas’ 
hospitality industry navigate the new 
economic realities it confronted after 
COVID–19 appeared and disrupted so 
much about how and when business op-
erated. Her selflessness and devotion to 
ensuring that the industry not only 
stayed alive, but succeeded during 
those difficult times, was truly inspir-
ing. 
McNulty has spent the past 25 years 
leading the AHA. There are a number 
of significant changes that have oc-
curred during her tenure as CEO, all of 
which McNulty adapted to for the ben-
efit of the AHA, the industry, and the 
Natural State’s economy. Technology 
innovations over the last two-and-a- 
half decades have allowed for quick and 
effective communication and relation-
ship building within the hospitality in-
dustry. McNulty expertly used these 
advancements to the advantage of AHA 
members, and the results have been to 
position the organization’s tools and 
capabilities to assist businesses in ex-
panding on and delivering better serv-
ices. 
Because of McNulty’s excellent lead-
ership skills, the Arkansas hospitality 
industry has been able to thrive for the 
past quarter century. She will be sin-
cerely missed when she leaves the 
AHA. 
Of course, McNulty will not com-
pletely leave the hospitality industry 
even after stepping down as CEO of 
AHA. She is an emeritus member of the 
Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism 
Commission, and current president of 
the Arkansas Tourism Development 
Foundation—roles that will allow her 
to continue offering her wisdom and 
expertise into the future. 
Montine McNulty is an excellent ex-
ample of a true leader and an excellent 
businesswoman. Arkansas will be for-
ever grateful for the contributions she 
has made to the hospitality industry 
and our economy. It is an honor to cel-
ebrate her 25 years of leadership and 
extend our sincere thanks for all her 
efforts that served to improve and con-
tribute to our great State.∑

TRIBUTE TO LEVI GOODAN AND 
MAURGAN MCGRATH 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Levi Goodan of 
Meriden and Maurgan McGrath of 
Hopkinton 
as 
October’s 
Granite 
Staters 
of 
the 
Month. 
Levi 
and 
Maurgan both separately started ini-
tiatives to donate toys and other goods 
to patients at the Children’s Hospital 
at Dartmouth—CHaD—to help provide 
comfort to young patients with serious 
illnesses. 
At the age of 8, Levi was treated at 
the Children’s Hospital at Dartmouth 
for multiple broken bones over the 
course of 1 year. Following his treat-
ment, Levi decided to donate his birth-
day and Christmas gifts to CHaD, since 
he knew how difficult spending nights 
at the hospital could be and wanted to 
lift peoples’ spirits. He was inspired by 
his late grandfather, who used to tell 
him stories about receiving treatment 
for polio when he was a child at Boston 
Children’s Hospital. His grandfather 
would frequently emphasize to Levi the 
importance of staying strong, hopeful, 
and positive in difficult circumstances. 
Since then, Levi continues to donate 
to CHaD. He most enjoys donating 
Legos, Play-Doh, fidget spinners, and 
projects such as kits to grow at-home 
crystals. 
Maurgan was born with a prenatal 
condition called malrotation, which re-
sults in problems in the normal forma-
tion of the fetal intestines, and as a re-
sult, she underwent various surgeries 
at ChaD while growing up. She remem-
bers how lonely her experience was at 
times and did not want other children 
to feel the same way. As part of her 
senior year project, Maurgan began 
collecting books, games, and pajamas 
for children at CHaD to help them re-
gain a sense of hope. 
Levi and Maurgan exemplify the 
Granite State spirit, taking a difficult 
time in their lives and using the expe-
rience as a source of strength. In both 
their cases, they helped bring joy to 
other young people who are facing 
similar challenges. Their commitment 
to helping other children navigating 
the often lonely, scary world of hos-
pital visits should inspire all of us to 
give back and become more involved in 
our communities. I am honored to 
name them as Granite Staters of the 
Month, and I know that they will con-
tinue to make a positive difference in 
their communities for years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO BRADEN AND JAYDEN 
HARPER 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
wish to honor two brave citizens of 
Junction City, KS, Braden and Jayden 
Harper. These young gentlemen put 
themselves in the face of danger to 
save two toddlers from a near fatal ac-
cident. 
In September, Braden and Jayden 
were helping their aunt wash her car, 
when they heard screaming coming 
from a nearby house. They thought at 
first it was just other children playing 
on a trampoline, but soon the scream-
ing sounded more like people in peril. 
The two boys peered over the fence of 
a nearby house to find the source of the 
noise and saw twin toddlers not even 2 
years old about to drown in a swim-
ming pool. 
The second they saw the situation, 
Braden and Jayden hopped over the 
fence and made a beeline for the pool 
to rescue the two toddlers. Both the 
twins were unharmed in the incident, 
thanks to the Harpers. 
Because of their efforts, the Harper 
brothers not only were acknowledged 
as heroes in school, but also by the 
Junction City Police Department. Now, 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing Braden and Jayden for their 
heroics. 
These two young men have truly 
shown what being a good neighbor and 
good citizen means. They have made 
their families and the great State of 
Kansas proud.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JULIA MISEMER 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
today I wish to congratulate Julia 
Misemer, of Blue Valley West High 
School in Overland Park, KS, on her 
fourth consecutive State champion 
title in golf. She is the only golfer to 
achieve 4-time 6A State champion in 
Kansas history. 
The Blue Valley West senior recorded 
back to back 73s in the 2-day Class 6A 
State tournament held at Emporia Mu-
nicipal Golf Course. Her excellence also 
helped the Jaguars take home the team 
State championship. Julia is now a 
four-time 
Eastern 
Kansas 
League 
Champion, 
four-time 
6A 
regional 
Champion, and four-time 6A State 
Champion—making her the most deco-
rated golfer in Kansas high school his-
tory. 
This year alone, Julia has also fin-
ished second in the Justin Thomas 
Junior Championship, second in the 
Girls Junior PGA Championship, and 
first in the UHY Kansas City Junior 
Tournament. She is currently ranked 
23rd nationally by the American Junior 
Golf Association. Julia was also a 
member of the Junior Ryder Cup Team 
which participated in an exhibition 
match at this year’s Ryder Cup at 
Whistling Straits in Kohler, WI. This 
incredible career of talent and consist-
ency on the golf course has been re-
warded by an offer to play at the Uni-
versity of Arizona, which she accepted. 
I take pride in distinguishing Julia 
Misemer as an exceptional competitor 
in the world of Kansas high school 
sports and national junior golf. I look 
forward to seeing Julia continue her 
athletic excellence at the collegiate 
level and beyond. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing Julia’s achievement and wish

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
TRANSMITTING NOTIFICATION OF 
THE 
PRESIDENT’S 
INTENT 
TO 
TERMINATE 
THE 
DESIGNATION 
OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA (ETHI-
OPIA), THE REPUBLIC OF GUIN-
EA (GUINEA), AND THE REPUB-
LIC OF MALI (MALI) AS BENE-
FICIARY SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES 
UNDER 
THE 
AFRI-
CAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY 
ACT (AGOA)—PM 16 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
In 
accordance 
with 
section 
506A(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)(B)), I 
am providing advance notification of 
my intent to terminate the designation 
of the Federal Democratic Republic of 
Ethiopia (Ethiopia), the Republic of 
Guinea (Guinea), and the Republic of 
Mali (Mali) as beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). 
I am taking this step as Ethiopia, 
Guinea, and Mali are not in compliance 
with the eligibility requirements of 
section 104 of the AGOA—in Ethiopia, 
for gross violations of internationally 
recognized human rights; in Guinea, 
for not having established, or not mak-
ing continual progress toward estab-
lishing, the protection of the rule of 
law and of political pluralism; and in 
Mali, for not having established, or not 
making continual progress toward es-
tablishing, the protection of the rule of 
law, political pluralism, and inter-
nationally recognized worker rights, 
and for not addressing gross violations 
of internationally recognized human 
rights. 
Despite intensive engagement be-
tween the United States and the Gov-
ernments of Ethiopia, Guinea, and 
Mali, these governments have failed to 
address United States concerns about 
their noncompliance with the AGOA 
eligibility criteria. 
Accordingly, I intend to terminate 
the designation of Ethiopia, Guinea, 
and Mali as beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries under the AGOA as 
of January 1, 2022. I will continue to as-
sess whether the Governments of Ethi-
opia, Guinea, and Mali are making con-
tinual progress toward meeting the 
AGOA eligibility requirements.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
436—HON-
ORING THE INDIVIDUALS FIGHT-
ING AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO 
HAVE FALLEN RESPONDING TO 
WILDLAND FIRES DURING THE 
ONGOING 2021 WILDFIRE SEASON 
Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. CRAPO, Mr. 
RISCH, 
Mr. 
BOOZMAN, 
Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER, Mr. PADILLA, and Mr. 
HEINRICH) submitted the following res-
olution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 436 
Whereas more than 5,000,000 acres have 
burned in wildfire in 2021; 
Whereas changing climates, resulting in 
long-term trends of warmer and drier weath-
er, and mismanagement of the forests of the 
United States are exacerbating the threat of 
wildfires and contributing to the greater 
than normal fire activity in Western States, 
resulting 
in 
dangerous 
conditions 
for 
wildland firefighters; 
Whereas more than 16,000 personnel have 
been assigned to contain and combat the 
fires that threaten the West; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic has exacerbated the 
public health and public safety risks inher-
ent in combating wildfires; 
Whereas Federal job classification and pay 
levels for wildland firefighters were estab-
lished more than 30 years ago and should be 
re-evaluated based on the current wildfire 
risk and job market; and 
Whereas wildland firefighters, first re-
sponders, sheriffs, and community leaders 
have acted bravely and risked their lives to 
contain 
dangerous 
wildfires 
across 
the 
United States to protect families and crit-
ical infrastructure: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the efforts and sacrifices of 
the wildland firefighters who have risked 
their lives to fight intense wildfires in 2021; 
(2) honors the bravery and heroism of the 
men and women assisting in responding to 
and combating wildfires; 
(3) expresses appreciation and gratitude to 
firefighters for protecting lives and property 
in the United States during the ongoing 2021 
wildfire season; 
(4) expresses full support for communities 
throughout the West as those communities 
focus on recovery and rebuilding areas and 
communities affected by wildfires; and 
(5) extends gratitude and appreciation to 
the families and loved ones of wildland fire-
fighters for their important role in sup-
porting the wildland firefighter community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7608 
November 2, 2021 
At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1224. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATIONS FOR USE 
OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 
102–1; 105 Stat. 3; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), enacted 
on January 14, 1991 (in this preamble ‘‘the 
1991 AUMF’’), and the Authorization for Use 
of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 
2002 (Public Law 107–243; 116 Stat. 1498; 50 
U.S.C. 1541 note), enacted on October 16, 2002 
(in this preamble ‘‘the 2002 AUMF’’), cur-
rently remain valid law. 
(2) Recent presidential administrations 
have maintained that the 2002 AUMF only 
serves to ‘‘reinforce’’ any legal authority to 
combat ISIS provided by the Authorization 
for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40; 
115 Stat. 224; 50 U.S.C. 1541), enacted Sep-
tember 18, 2001, and is not independently re-
quired to authorize any such activities. 
(3) Repealing the 1991 AUMF and the 2002 
AUMF would therefore not affect ongoing 
United States military operations. 
(4) Since 2014, United States military 
forces have operated in Iraq at the request of 
the Government of Iraq for the sole purpose 
of supporting its efforts to combat ISIS, con-
sistent with the Strategic Framework Agree-
ment that Iraq and the United States signed 
on November 17, 2008. 
(5) During a press briefing on December 24, 
2020, Commander of the United States Cen-
tral Command, General Frank McKenzie, re-
iterated that United States forces are in Iraq 
‘‘at their invitation’’. 
(6) Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken 
and Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi of 
Iraq discussed ‘‘the Iraqi government’s re-
sponsibility and commitment to protect U.S. 
and Coalition personnel in Iraq at the gov-
ernment’s invitation to fight ISIS’’ in a Feb-
ruary 16, 2021, phone call. 
(7) Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III 
stated on February 19, 2021, that he ‘‘wel-
comed that expanded NATO mission in Iraq 
that responds to the desires and aspirations 
of the Iraqi government’’. 
(8) In a February 23, 2021, call with Prime 
Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi of Iraq, Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden affirmed United States 
support for Iraq’s ‘‘sovereignty and inde-
pendence’’. 
(9) Neither the 1991 AUMF nor the 2002 
AUMF are being used as the sole legal basis 
for any detention of enemy combatants cur-
rently held by the United States. 
(10) Authorizations for the use of military 
force that are no longer necessary should 
have a clear political and legal ending. 
(b) REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF 
MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION.— 
The Authorization for Use of Military Force 
Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102–1; 
105 Stat. 3; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby re-
pealed. 
(c) REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF 
MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION 
OF 2002.—The Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 
(Public Law 107–243; 116 Stat. 1498; 50 U.S.C. 
1541 note) is hereby repealed. 
SA 4134. Mr. KAINE submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. 
REED and intended to be proposed to 
the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and

year, and for other purposes; which was

lowing:

military magistrates to issue military court 
protective orders 
‘‘(a) AUTHORITY TO ISSUE MILITARY COURT 
PROTECTIVE
ORDERS.—The President shall 
prescribe regulations authorizing military 
judges and military magistrates to issue pro-
tective orders in accordance with this sec-
tion. A protective order issued in accordance 
with this section shall be known as a ‘mili-
tary court protective order’. Under the regu-
lations prescribed by the President, military 
judges and military magistrates shall have 
exclusive jurisdiction over the issuance, ap-
peal, renewal, and termination of military 
court protective orders and such orders may 
not be issued, appealed, renewed, or termi-
nated by State, local, territorial, or tribal 
courts. 
‘‘(b) ENFORCEMENT
BY CIVILIAN AUTHORI-
TIES.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—In prescribing regula-
tions for military court protective orders, 
the President shall seek to ensure that the

manner that is enforceable by State, local, 
territorial, and tribal civilian law enforce-
ment authorities. 
‘‘(2) FULL FAITH AND CREDIT.—Any military 
court protective order shall be accorded full 
faith and credit by the court of a State, 
local, territorial, or tribal jurisdiction (the 
enforcing jurisdiction) and enforced by the 
court and law enforcement personnel of that 
jurisdiction as if it were the order of the en-
forcing jurisdiction. 
‘‘(3) RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS.—Consistent 
with paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary of 
Defense shall seek to enter into reciprocity 
agreements with State, local, territorial, and 
tribal civilian law enforcement authorities

tary court protective orders; and

tecting a victim of an alleged covered of-
fense, or a family member or associate of the 
victim, from a person subject to chapter 47 of 
this title (the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice) who is alleged to have committed such 
an offense; and 
‘‘(2) shall include— 
‘‘(A) a finding regarding whether such per-
son represents a credible threat to the phys-
ical safety of such alleged victim; 
‘‘(B) a finding regarding whether the al-
leged victim is an intimate partner or child 
of such person; and 
‘‘(C) if applicable, terms explicitly prohib-
iting the use, attempted use, or threatened 
use of physical force that would reasonably 
be expected to cause bodily injury against 
such intimate partner or child. 
‘‘(d) BURDEN
OF
PROOF.—In determining 
whether to issue a military court protective 
order, a military judge or military mag-
istrate shall make all relevant findings by a 
preponderance of the evidence. The burden 
shall be on the party requesting the order to 
produce sufficient information to satisfy the 
preponderance of the evidence standard re-
ferred to in the preceding sentence. 
‘‘(e) TIMING AND MANNER OF ISSUANCE.—A 
military court protective order may be 
issued—

ral of charges and specifications to court- 
martial for trial, at the request of— 
‘‘(A) a victim of an alleged covered offense; 
or 
‘‘(B) a Special Victims’ Counsel or other 
qualified counsel acting on behalf of the vic-
tim; or 
‘‘(2) by a military judge, after referral of 
charges and specifications to court-martial 
for trial, at the request of qualified counsel, 
which may include a Special Victims’ Coun-
sel acting on behalf of the victim or trial 
counsel acting on behalf of the prosecution. 
‘‘(f) DURATION AND RENEWAL OF PROTECTIVE 
ORDER.— 
‘‘(1) DURATION.—A military court protec-
tive order shall be issued for an initial period 
of up to 180 days and may be reissued for one 
or more additional periods, each of which 
may be up to 180 days, in accordance with 
paragraph (2). 
‘‘(2) EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL.—Before the 
expiration of any period during which a mili-
tary court protective order is in effect, a

such period or be reissued for an additional 
period of up to 180 days.

TO
PROTECTED
PERSONS.—If a 
military judge or military magistrate deter-
mines under paragraph (2) that a military

OR-
DERS.—

tary court protective order should be termi-
nated.

ment at the proceeding, as applicable.

thorium fuel cycle. 
(4) Thorium itself is not fissile, but fertile, 
and requires a fissile material to begin a nu-
clear chain reaction. 
(5) Uranium-233, derived from neutron ab-
sorption by natural thorium, is the ideal 
candidate for the fissile component of a tho-
rium reactor, and is the only fissile material 
candidate that can minimize the production 
of long-lived transuranic elements, which 
have proven a great challenge to the geo-
logic disposal of existing spent nuclear fuel. 
(6) Geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
from conventional nuclear reactors con-
tinues to pose severe political and technical 
challenges, and costs the United States tax-
payer more than $500,000,000 annually in 
court-mandated awards to utilities. 
(7) The United States possesses the largest 
inventory of uranium-233 in the world, aggre-
gated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) it is in the best economic and national 
security interests of the United States to re-
sume development of highly efficient tho-
rium molten-salt reactors that can minimize 
transuranic waste production, in consider-
ation of the pursuit by the People’s Republic 
of China of thorium molten-salt reactors and 
associated cooperative research agreements 
with United States national laboratories; 
(2) that the development of highly efficient 
thorium molten-salt reactors is consistent 
with section 1261 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232; 132 Stat. 2060), 
which declared long-term strategic competi-
tion with the People’s Republic of China as 
‘‘a principal priority for the United States’’; 
and 
(3) to resume such development, it is nec-
essary to preserve as much of the uranium- 
233 remaining at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory as possible. 
(c) PRESERVATION
AND STORAGE
OF URA-
NIUM-233.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Energy 
shall seek every opportunity to preserve sep-
arated uranium-233, with the goal of fos-
tering development of thorium molten-salt 
reactors by United States industry. 
(2) DOWNBLENDING AND DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN 
URANIUM.—The Secretary may provide for 
the downblending and disposal of uranium- 
233 determined by industry experts not to be 
valuable for research and development of 
thorium molten-salt reactors or technology 
implementation. 
(d) INTERAGENCY COOPERATION.—The Sec-
retary of Energy, the Secretary of the Army 
(including the head of the Army Reactor Of-
fice), the Secretary of Transportation, the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, and other rel-
evant agencies shall— 
(1) work together to expedite transfers of 
uranium-233 under subsection (c); and 
(2) seek the assistance of appropriate in-
dustrial entities. 
(e) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to 
the congressional defense committees a re-
port that includes the following: 
(1) Details of the separated U-233 inventory 
that is most feasible for immediate or near- 
term transfer. 
(2) The costs of constructing or modifying 
a suitable category I facility for the secure, 
permanent storage of the U–233 inventory. 
(3) A pathway for National Asset Material 
designation. 
(4) A description of the scope for such a fa-
cility that would enable secure access to the 
nuclear material for research and develop-
ment of thorium fuel cycle reactors, for de-
fense and civilian applications, as well as for 
medical isotope extraction and processing, 
including by developing such a facility 
through public-private partnerships. 
(5) An assessment of whether the Secretary 
should transfer the ownership of U–233 from 
the Office of Environmental Management to 
the Office of Nuclear Energy. 
(6) An assessment of the ability of the De-
partment of Energy to transfer the inven-
tory of U–233 that the Secretary determines 
is most feasible for immediate or near-term 
transfer to the Y–12 National Security Com-
plex, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for secure in-
terim storage. 
(7) The feasibility of the National Nuclear 
Security Administration providing for the 
secure storage of the inventory of U–233 
within the Y–12 National Security Complex 
or another suitable location within the nu-
clear security enterprise (as defined in sec-
tion 4002 of the Atomic Energy Defense Act 
(50 U.S.C. 2501)). 
(f) NO FUNDING AUTHORIZED.—The amount 
authorized to be appropriated by section 3102 
and available as specified in the funding 
table in section 4701 for the U233 Disposition 
Program is hereby reduced by $55,000,000.

such an exercise can assist in national heal-
ing; 
(C) the extent of the loss of life and the 
economic cost of the pandemic demonstrate 
the high risks that pandemic diseases can 
pose to public health and to national secu-
rity, and demands a thorough, authoritative, 
and independent review of the origin of 
SARS–CoV–2 as well as United States ac-
tions and policies before and during the pan-
demic, and recommendations to Congress 
and policymakers as to how we can be better 
prepared for future pandemic diseases, in-
cluding those that could be caused by inten-
tional biological attacks;

Interparliamentary Partnership Act of 2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘U.S.- 
Greece Defense and Interparliamentary Part-
nership Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States and Greece are 
strong allies in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) and have deepened 
their defense relationship in recent years in 
response to growing security challenges in 
the Eastern Mediterranean region. 
(2) Greece participates in several NATO 
missions, including Operation Sea Guardian 
in the Mediterranean and NATO’s mission in 
Kosovo. 
(3) The Eastern Mediterranean Security 
and Energy Partnership Act (title II of divi-
sion J of Public Law 116–94), authorized new 
security assistance for Greece and Cyprus, 
lifted the United States prohibition on arms 
transfers to Cyprus, and authorized the es-
tablishment of a United States-Eastern Med-
iterranean Energy Center to facilitate en-
ergy cooperation among the United States, 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus. 
(4) The United States has demonstrated its 
support for the trilateral partnership of 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus through joint en-
gagement with Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and 
the United States in the ‘‘3+1’’ format. 
(5) The United States and Greece have held 
Strategic Dialogue meetings in Athens, 
Washington D.C., and virtually, and have 
committed to hold an upcoming Strategic 
Dialogue session in 2021 in Washington, D.C. 
(6) In October 2019, the United States and 
Greece agreed to update the United States- 
Greece Mutual Defense Cooperation Agree-
ment, and the amended agreement officially 
entered into force on February 13, 2020. 
(7) The amended Mutual Defense Coopera-
tion Agreement provides for increased joint 
United States-Greece and NATO activities at 
Greek 
military 
bases 
and 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, Alexandroupolis, and 
other parts of central and northern Greece, 
and allows for infrastructure improvements 
at the United States Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay base on Crete. 
(8) In October 2020, Greek Foreign Minister 
Nikos Dendias announced that Greece hopes 
to further expand the Mutual Defense Co-
operation Agreement with the United States. 
(9) The United States Naval Support Activ-
ity Souda Bay serves as a critical naval lo-
gistics hub for the United States Navy’s 6th 
Fleet. 
(10) In June 2020, United States Ambas-
sador to Greece Geoffrey Pyatt characterized 
the importance of Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay as ‘‘our most important platform 
for the projection of American power into a 
strategically dynamic Eastern Mediterra-
nean region. From Syria to Libya to the 
chokepoint of the Black Sea, this is a criti-
cally important asset for the United States, 
as our air force, naval, and other resources 
are applied to support our Alliance obliga-
tions and to help bring peace and stability.’’.

Bay, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

announced that the USS Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ 
Williams, the second of a new class of United 
States sea-basing ships, will be based out of 
Souda Bay, the first permanent United 
States naval deployment at the base. 
(12) The United States cooperates with the 
Hellenic 
Armed 
Forces 
at 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, and Alexandroupolis, 
where the United States Armed Forces con-
duct training, refueling, temporary mainte-
nance, storage, and emergency response. 
(13) The United States has conducted a 
longstanding International Military Edu-
cation and Training (IMET) program with 
Greece, and the Government of Greece has 
committed to provide $3 for every dollar in-
vested by the United States in the program. 
(14) Greece’s defense spending in 2020 
amounted to an estimated 2.68 percent of its 
gross domestic product (GDP), exceeding 
NATO’s 2 percent of GDP benchmark agreed 
to at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales. 
(15) Greece is eligible for the delivery of ex-
cess defense articles under section 516(c)(2) of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2321j(c)(2)). 
(16) In September 2020, Greek Prime Min-
ister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced plans 
to modernize all three branches of the Hel-
lenic Armed Forces, which will strengthen

Mediterranean. 
(17) The modernization includes upgrades

new anti-tank weapons for the Hellenic 
Army, new heavy-duty torpedoes for the Hel-
lenic Navy, and new guided missiles for the 
Hellenic Air Force.

terest in participating in the F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighter program. 
(20) The United States ejected Turkey from 
the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter Program in 
July 2019 as a result of its purchase of the 
Russian S-400 air defense system. Eight F–35 
Joint Strike Fighters were produced for Tur-
key but never delivered as a result of its 
ejection from the program. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Greece is a pillar of stability in the 
Eastern 
Mediterranean 
region 
and 
the 
United States should remain committed to 
supporting its security and prosperity;

deepen efforts to partner with and support 
the modernization of the Greek military;

Russian S-400 air defense system;

ment in strategic infrastructure projects in

Greece’s prosperity; 
(11) the extension of the Mutual Defense 
Cooperation Agreement with Greece for a pe-
riod of five years includes deepened partner-
ships at Greek military facilities throughout

tary construction funds for construction 
projects at Naval Support Activity Souda

grams in 2019; and

SA 4171. Mr. MARKEY submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. 
REED and intended to be proposed to 
the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the 
following: 
SEC. 1548. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR 
GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC DETER-
RENT PROGRAM AND W87–1 WAR-
HEAD MODIFICATION PROGRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) According to the Congressional Budget 
Office, the projected cost to sustain and 
modernize the United States nuclear arsenal, 
as of 2017, ‘‘is $1.2 trillion in 2017 dollars over 
the 2017–2046 period: more than $800 billion to 
operate and sustain (that is, incrementally 
upgrade) nuclear forces and about $400 bil-
lion to modernize them’’. With inflation, the 
cost rises to $1,700,000,000,000 and does not in-
clude the cost of the additional nuclear capa-
bilities proposed in the 2018 Nuclear Posture 
Review. 
(2) Maintaining and updating the current 
Minuteman 
III 
intercontinental 
ballistic 
missiles is possible for multiple decades and, 
according to the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, 
through 
2036, 
this 
would 
cost 
$37,000,000,000 less in 2017 dollars than devel-
oping and deploying the ground-based stra-
tegic deterrent program. 
(3) A public opinion poll conducted from 
October 12 to 28, 2020, by ReThink Media and 
the Federation of American Scientists found 
that only 26 percent of registered voters in 
the United States preferred replacing the 
Minuteman 
III 
intercontinental 
ballistic 
missile with the ground-based strategic de-
terrent, as compared to 60 percent of reg-
istered voters who opposed replacing the 
Minuteman III missile. 
(b) LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.—None of 
the funds authorized to be appropriated or 
otherwise made available for fiscal year 2022 
may be obligated or expended for the ground- 
based strategic deterrent program or the 
W87–1 warhead modification program until 
the later of— 
(1) the date on which the Secretary of De-
fense submits to the appropriate congres-
sional committees a certification that the 
operational life of Minuteman III interconti-
nental ballistic missiles cannot be safely ex-
tended through at least 2050; and 
(2) the date on which the Secretary trans-
mits to the appropriate congressional com-
mittees the report required by paragraph (3) 
of subsection (c), as required by paragraph 
(4) of that subsection. 
(c) INDEPENDENT STUDY
ON EXTENSION
OF 
MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILES.— 
(1) INDEPENDENT STUDY.—Not later than 30 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Defense shall seek to 
enter into a contract with the National 
Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on 
extending the life of Minuteman III inter-
continental ballistic missiles to 2050. 
(2) MATTERS
INCLUDED.—The study under 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) A comparison of the costs through 2050 
of— 
(i) extending the life of Minuteman III 
intercontinental ballistic missiles; and 
(ii) deploying the ground-based strategic 
deterrent program. 
(B) An analysis of opportunities to incor-
porate technologies into the Minuteman III 
intercontinental ballistic missile program as 
part of a service life extension program that 
could also be incorporated in the future 
ground-based strategic deterrent program, 
including, at a minimum, opportunities to 
increase the resilience against adversary 
missile defenses. 
(C) An analysis of the benefits and risks of 
incorporating sensors and nondestructive 
testing methods and technologies to reduce 
destructive testing requirements and in-
crease the service life and number of Minute-
man III missiles through 2050. 
(D) An analysis and validation of the meth-
ods used to estimate the operational service 
life of Minuteman II and Minuteman III mo-
tors, taking into account the test and launch 
experience of motors retired after the oper-
ational service life of such motors in the 
rocket systems launch program. 
(E) An analysis of the risks and benefits of 
alternative methods of estimating the oper-
ational service life of Minuteman III motors, 
such as those methods based on fundamental 
physical and chemical processes and non-
destructive 
measurements 
of 
individual 
motor properties. 
(F) An analysis of risks, benefits, and costs 
of configuring a Trident II D5 submarine 
launched ballistic missile for deployment in 
a Minuteman III silo. 
(G) An analysis of the impacts of the esti-
mated service life of the Minuteman III force 
associated with decreasing the deployed 
intercontinental ballistic missiles delivery 
vehicle force from 400 to 300. 
(H) An assessment on the degree to which 
the Columbia class ballistic missile sub-
marines will possess features that will en-
hance the current invulnerability of ballistic 
missile submarines of the United States to 
future antisubmarine warfare threats. 
(I) An analysis of the degree to which an 
extension of the Minuteman III would im-
pact the decision of Russian Federation to 
target intercontinental ballistic missiles of 
the United States in a crisis, as compared to 
proceeding with the ground-based strategic 
deterrent. 
(J) A best case estimate of what percent-
age of the strategic forces of the United 
States would survive a counterforce strike 
from the Russian Federation, broken down 
by intercontinental ballistic missiles, bal-
listic missile submarines, and heavy bomber 
aircraft. 
(K) The benefits, risks, and costs of relying 
on the W–78 warhead for either the Minute-
man III or a new ground-based strategic de-
terrent missile as compared to proceeding 
with the W–87 life extension. 
(L) The benefits, risks, and costs of adding 
additional 
launchers 
or 
uploading 
sub-
marine-launched ballistic missiles with addi-
tional warheads to compensate for a reduced 
deployment of intercontinental ballistic mis-
siles of the United States. 
(M) An analysis of whether designing and 
fielding a new intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile through at least 2070 is consistent with 
the obligation of the United States under Ar-
ticle VI of the Treaty on the Non-Prolifera-
tion of Nuclear Weapons done at Wash-
ington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (21 
UST 483) (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Nu-
clear Non-Proliferation Treaty’’) to ‘‘pursue

SA 4172. Mr. MARKEY (for himself, 
Ms. SMITH, and Mr. MERKLEY) sub-
mitted an amendment intended to be 
proposed to amendment SA 3867 sub-
mitted by Mr. REED and intended to be 
proposed to the bill H.R. 4350, to au-
thorize appropriations for fiscal year 
2022 for military activities of the De-
partment of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of 
the Department of Energy, to prescribe 
military personnel strengths for such 
fiscal year, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the 
following: 
SEC. 1548. RESTRICTION ON FIRST-USE STRIKE 
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.. 
(a) FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The Constitution gives Congress the 
sole power to declare war. 
(B) The framers of the Constitution under-
stood that the monumental decision to go to 
war, which can result in massive death and 
the destruction of civilized society, must be 
made by the representatives of the people 
and not by a single person. 
(C) As stated by section 2(c) of the War 
Powers Resolution (Public Law 93–148; 50 
U.S.C. 1541), ‘‘the constitutional powers of 
the President as Commander-in-Chief to in-
troduce United States Armed Forces into 
hostilities, or into situations where immi-
nent involvement in hostilities is clearly in-
dicated by the circumstances, are exercised 
only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) 
specific statutory authorization, or (3) a na-
tional emergency created by attack upon the 
United States, its territories or possessions, 
or its armed forces’’. 
(D) Nuclear weapons are uniquely powerful 
weapons that have the capability to in-
stantly kill millions of people, create long- 
term 
health 
and 
environmental 
con-
sequences throughout the world, directly un-
dermine global peace, and put the United 
States at existential risk from retaliatory 
nuclear strikes. 
(E) A first-use nuclear strike carried out 
by the United States would constitute a 
major act of war. 
(F) A first-use nuclear strike conducted ab-
sent a declaration of war by Congress would 
violate the Constitution. 
(G) The President has the sole authority to 
authorize the use of nuclear weapons, an 
order which military officers of the United 
States must carry out in accordance with 
their obligations under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice. 
(H) Given its exclusive power under the 
Constitution to declare war, Congress must 
provide meaningful checks and balances to 
the President’s sole authority to authorize 
the use of a nuclear weapon. 
(2) DECLARATION OF POLICY.—It is the pol-
icy of the United States that no first-use nu-
clear strike should be conducted absent a 
declaration of war by Congress. 
(b) PROHIBITION ON CONDUCT OF FIRST-USE 
NUCLEAR STRIKES.— 
(1) PROHIBITION.—No Federal funds may be 
obligated or expended to conduct a first-use 
nuclear strike unless such strike is con-
ducted pursuant to a war declared by Con-
gress that expressly authorizes such strike. 
(2) FIRST-USE NUCLEAR STRIKE DEFINED.—In 
this subsection, the term ‘‘first-use nuclear 
strike’’ means an attack using nuclear weap-
ons against an enemy that is conducted 
without the Secretary of Defense and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff first 
confirming to the President that there has 
been a nuclear strike against the United 
States, its territories, or its allies (as speci-
fied in section 3(b)(2) of the Arms Export 
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2753(b)(2))). 
SA 4173. Mr. MARKEY submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. 
REED and intended to be proposed to 
the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the 
following: 
SEC. 1548. REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING ON NU-
CLEAR WEAPONS; PROHIBITION ON 
PROCUREMENT AND DEPLOYMENT 
OF 
LOW-YIELD 
NUCLEAR 
WAR-
HEADS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The United States continues to main-
tain an excessively large and costly arsenal 
of nuclear delivery systems and warheads 
that are a holdover from the Cold War. 
(2) The current nuclear arsenal of the 
United States includes approximately 3,800 
total nuclear warheads in its military stock-
pile, of which approximately 1,750 are de-
ployed with five delivery components: land- 
based intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, long- 
range strategic bomber aircraft armed with 
nuclear gravity bombs, long-range strategic 
bomber aircraft armed with nuclear-armed 
air-launched cruise missiles, and short-range 
fighter aircraft that can deliver nuclear 
gravity bombs. The strategic bomber fleet of 
the United States comprises 87 B–52 and 20 
B–2 aircraft, over 60 of which contribute to 
the nuclear mission. The United States also 
maintains 400 intercontinental ballistic mis-
siles and 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 
of which are deployed. Each of those sub-
marines is armed with approximately 90 nu-
clear warheads. 
(3) Between fiscal years 2021 and 2030, the 
United States will spend an estimated 
$634,000,000,000 to maintain and recapitalize 
its nuclear force, according to a January 2019 
estimate from the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, an increase of $140,000,000,000 from the 
Congressional Budget Office’s 2019 estimate, 
with 36 percent of that additional cost stem-
ming ‘‘mainly from new plans for modern-
izing [the Department of Energy’s] produc-
tion facilities and from [the Department of 
Defense’s] modernization programs moving 
more fully into production’’. 
(4) Adjusted for inflation, the Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that the 
United States will spend $1,700,000,000,000 
through fiscal year 2046 on new nuclear 
weapons and modernization and infrastruc-
ture programs. 
(5) Inaccurate budget forecasting is likely 
to continue to plague the Department of De-
fense and the Department of Energy, as evi-
denced by the fiscal year 2021 budget request 
of the President for the National Nuclear Se-
curity Administration ‘‘Weapon Activities’’ 
account, which far exceeded what the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administration had 
projected in its fiscal year 2020 request and 
what it had projected in previous years. 
(6) The projected growth in nuclear weap-
ons spending is coming due as the Depart-
ment of Defense is seeking to replace large 
portions of its conventional forces to better 
compete with the Russian Federation and 
the People’s Republic of China and as inter-
nal and external fiscal pressures are likely to 
limit the growth of, and perhaps reduce, 
military spending. As then-Air Force Chief 
of Staff General Dave Goldfein said in 2020, 
‘‘I think a debate is that this will be the first 
time that the nation has tried to simulta-
neously modernize the nuclear enterprise 
while it’s trying to modernize an aging con-
ventional enterprise. The current budget 
does not allow you to do both.’’. 
(7) In 2017, the Government Accountability 
Office concluded that National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration’s budget forecasts for 
out-year spending downplayed the fact that 
the agency lacked the resources to complete 
multiple, simultaneous billion dollar mod-
ernization projects and recommended that 
the National Nuclear Security Administra-
tion consider ‘‘deferring the start of or can-
celling specific modernization programs’’. 
(8) According to the Government Account-
ability Office, the National Nuclear Security 
Administration has still not factored afford-
ability concerns into its planning as was rec-
ommended by the Government Account-
ability Office in 2017, with the warning that 
‘‘it is essential for NNSA to present informa-
tion to Congress and other key decision 
maker indicating whether the agency has 
prioritized certain modernization programs 
or considered trade-offs (such as deferring or 
cancelling 
specific 
modernization 
pro-
grams)’’. 
(9) A December 2020 Congressional Budget 
Office analysis showed that the projected 
costs of nuclear forces over the next decade 
can 
be 
reduced 
by 
$12,400,000,000 
to 
$13,600,000,000 by trimming back current 
plans, while still maintaining a triad of de-
livery systems. Even larger savings would 
accrue over the subsequent decade. 
(10) The Department of Defense’s June 2013 
nuclear policy guidance entitled ‘‘Report on 
Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United 
States’’ found that force levels under the 
April 2010 Treaty on Measures for the Fur-
ther Reduction and Limitation of Strategic

REED and intended to be proposed to

priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the 
following: 
SEC. 1548. REDUCTION OF THREATS POSED BY 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The use of nuclear weapons poses an ex-
istential threat to humanity, a fact that led 
President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier 
Mikhail Gorbachev to declare in a joint 
statement in 1987 that a ‘‘nuclear war cannot 
be won and must never be fought’’. 
(2) On June 12, 1982, an estimated 1,000,000 
people attended the largest peace rally in 
United States history, in support of a move-
ment to freeze and reverse the nuclear arms 
race, a movement that helped to create the 
political will necessary for the negotiation 
of several bilateral arms control treaties be-
tween the United States and former Soviet 
Union, and then the Russian Federation. 
Those treaties contributed to strategic sta-
bility through mutual and verifiable recip-
rocal nuclear weapons reductions. 
(3) Since the advent of nuclear weapons in 
1945, millions of people around the world 
have stood up to demand meaningful, imme-
diate international action to halt, reduce, 
and eliminate the threats posed by nuclear 
weapons, nuclear weapons testing, and nu-
clear war, to humankind and the planet. 
(4) In 1970, the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons done at Wash-
ington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (21 
UST 483) (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Nu-
clear 
Non-Proliferation 
Treaty’’ 
or 
the 
‘‘NPT’’) entered into force, which includes a 
binding obligation on the 5 nuclear-weapon 
states (commonly referred to as the ‘‘P5’’), 
among other things, ‘‘to pursue negotiations 
in good faith on effective measures relating 
to the cessation of the nuclear arms race . . . 
and to nuclear disarmament’’. 
(5) Bipartisan United States global leader-
ship has curbed the growth in the number of 
countries possessing nuclear weapons and 
has slowed overall vertical proliferation 
among countries already possessing nuclear 
weapons, as is highlighted by a more than 85- 
percent reduction in the United States nu-
clear weapons stockpile from its Cold War 
height of 31,255 in 1967. 
(6) The United States testing of nuclear 
weapons is no longer necessary as a result of 
the following major technical developments 
since the Senate’s consideration of the Com-
prehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (com-
monly referred to as the ‘‘CTBT’’) in 1999: 
(A) The verification architecture of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban-Treaty Or-
ganization (commonly referred to as the 
‘‘CTBTO’’)— 
(i) has made significant advancements, as 
seen through its network of 300 International 
Monitoring Stations and its International 
Data Centre, which together provide for the 
near instantaneous detection of nuclear ex-
plosives tests, including all 6 such tests con-
ducted by North Korea between 2006 and 2017; 
and 
(ii) is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week. 
(B) Since the United States signed the 
CTBT, confidence has grown in the science- 
based Stockpile Stewardship and Manage-
ment Plan of the Department of Energy, 
which forms the basis of annual certifi-
cations to the President regarding the con-
tinual safety, security, and effectiveness of 
the United States nuclear deterrent in the 
absence of nuclear testing, leading former 
Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz to remark 
in 2015 that ‘‘lab directors today now state 
that they certainly understand much more 
about how nuclear weapons work than dur-
ing the period of nuclear testing’’. 
(7) Despite the progress made to reduce the 
number and role of, and risks posed by, nu-
clear weapons, and to halt the Cold War-era 
nuclear arms race, tensions between coun-
tries that possess nuclear weapons are on the 
rise, key nuclear risk reduction treaties are 
under threat, significant stockpiles of weap-
ons-usable fissile material remain, and a 
qualitative global nuclear arms race is now 
underway with each of the countries that 
possess nuclear weapons spending tens of bil-
lions of dollars each year to maintain and 
improve their arsenals. 
(8) The Russian Federation is pursuing the 
development of destabilizing types of nuclear 
weapons that are not presently covered 
under any existing arms control treaty or 
agreement and the People’s Republic of 
China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea 
have each taken concerning steps to diver-
sify their more modest sized, but nonetheless 
very deadly, nuclear arsenals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7644 
November 2, 2021 
(9) Former President Donald J. Trump’s 
2018 Nuclear Posture Review called for the 
development two new nuclear weapons capa-
bilities, which have the effect of lowering 
the threshold for nuclear weapons use: 
(A) A low-yield warhead on a submarine- 
launched ballistic missile, which was de-
ployed before the date of the enactment of 
this Act. 
(B) A sea-launched cruise missile, still 
under development on the date of the enact-
ment of this Act. 
(10) On February 3, 2021, President Joseph 
R. Biden preserved binding and verifiable 
limits on the deployed and non-deployed 
strategic forces of the largest two nuclear 
weapons powers through the five-year exten-
sion of the Treaty between the United States 
of America and the Russian Federation on 
Measures for the Further Reduction and 
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 
signed April 8, 2010, and entered into force 
February 5, 2011 (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘New START Treaty’’). 
(11) In 2013, the report on a nuclear weap-
ons employment strategy of the United 
States submitted under section 492 of title 
10, United States Code, determined that it is 
possible to ensure the security of the United 
States and allies and partners of the United 
States and maintain a strong and credible 
strategic deterrent while safely pursuing up 
to a 1⁄3 reduction in deployed nuclear weap-
ons from the level established in the New 
START Treaty. 
(12) On January 12, 2017, then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden stated, ‘‘[G]iven our non-nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
today’s 
threats—it’s hard to envision a plausible sce-
nario in which the first use of nuclear weap-
ons by the United States would be necessary. 
Or make sense.’’. 
(13) In light of moves by the United States 
and other countries to increase their reli-
ance on nuclear weapons, a global nuclear 
freeze would seek to halt the new nuclear 
arms race by seeking conclusion of a com-
prehensive and verifiable freeze on the test-
ing, deployment, and production of nuclear 
weapons and delivery vehicles for such weap-
ons. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—The following 
is the policy of the United States: 
(1) The United States should build upon its 
decades long, bipartisan efforts to reduce the 
number and salience of nuclear weapons by 
leading international negotiations on spe-
cific arms-reduction measures as part of a 
21st century global nuclear freeze movement. 
(2) Building on the successful extension of 
the New START Treaty, the United States 
should engage with all other countries that 
possess nuclear weapons to seek to negotiate 
and conclude future multilateral arms con-
trol, disarmament, and risk reduction agree-
ments, which should contain some or all of 
the following provisions: 
(A) An agreement by the United States and 
the Russian Federation on a follow-on treaty 
or agreement to the New START Treaty that 
may lower the central limits of the Treaty 
and cover new kinds of strategic delivery ve-
hicles or non-strategic nuclear weapons. 
(B) An agreement on a verifiable freeze on 
the testing, production, and further deploy-
ment of all nuclear weapons and delivery ve-
hicles for such weapons. 
(C) 
An 
agreement 
that 
establishes 
a 
verifiable numerical ceiling on the deployed 
shorter-range and intermediate-range and 
strategic delivery systems (as defined by the 
INF Treaty and the New START Treaty, re-
spectively) and the nuclear warheads associ-
ated with such systems belonging to the P5, 
and to the extent possible, all countries that 
possess nuclear weapons, at August 2, 2019, 
levels. 
(D) An agreement by each country to adopt 
a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons or 
provide transparency into its nuclear declar-
atory policy. 
(E) An agreement on a proactive United 
Nations Security Council resolution that ex-
pands access by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to any country found by the 
Board of Governors of that Agency to be non-
compliant with its obligations under the 
NPT. 
(F) An agreement to refrain from config-
uring nuclear forces in a ‘‘launch on warn-
ing’’ or ‘‘launch under warning’’ nuclear pos-
ture, which may prompt a nuclear armed 
country to launch a ballistic missile attack 
in response to detection by an early-warning 
satellite or sensor of a suspected incoming 
ballistic missile. 
(G) An agreement not to target or interfere 
in the nuclear command, control, and com-
munications 
(commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
‘‘NC3’’) infrastructure of another country 
through a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. 
(H) An agreement on transparency meas-
ures 
or 
verifiable 
limits, 
or 
both, 
on 
hypersonic cruise missiles and glide vehicles 
that are fired from sea-based, ground, and air 
platforms. 
(I) An agreement to provide a baseline and 
continuous exchanges detailing the aggre-
gate number of active nuclear weapons and 
associated systems possessed by each coun-
try. 
(3) The United States should rejuvenate ef-
forts in the United Nations Conference on 
Disarmament toward the negotiation of a 
verifiable Fissile Material Treaty or Fissile 
Material Cutoff Treaty, or move negotia-
tions to another international body or fora, 
such as a meeting of the P5. Successful con-
clusion of such a treaty would verifiably pre-
vent any country’s production of highly en-
riched uranium and plutonium for use in nu-
clear weapons. 
(4) The United States should convene a se-
ries of head-of-state level summits on nu-
clear disarmament modeled on the Nuclear 
Security Summits process, which saw the 
elimination of the equivalent of 3,000 nuclear 
weapons. 
(5) The President should seek ratification 
by the Senate of the CTBT and mobilize all 
countries covered by Annex 2 of the CTBT to 
pursue similar action to hasten entry into 
force of the CTBT. The entry into force of 
the CTBT, for which ratification by the 
United States will provide critical momen-
tum, will activate the CTBT’s onsite inspec-
tion provision to investigate allegations that 
any country that is a party to the CTBT has 
conducted a nuclear test of any yield. 
(6) The President should make the acces-
sion of North Korea to the CTBT a compo-
nent of any final agreement in fulfilling the 
pledges the Government of North Korea 
made in Singapore, as North Korea is report-
edly the only country to have conducted a 
nuclear explosive test since 1998. 
(7) The United States should— 
(A) refrain from developing any new de-
signs for nuclear warheads or bombs, but es-
pecially designs that could add a level of 
technical uncertainty into the United States 
stockpile and thus renew calls to resume nu-
clear explosive testing in order to test that 
new design; and 
(B) seek reciprocal commitments from 
other countries that possess nuclear weap-
ons. 
(c) PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR NU-
CLEAR TEST EXPLOSIONS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—None of the funds author-
ized to be appropriated or otherwise made 
available for fiscal year 2022 or any fiscal 
year thereafter, or authorized to be appro-
priated or otherwise made available for any 
fiscal year before fiscal year 2022 and avail-
able for obligation as of the date of the en-
actment of this Act, may be obligated or ex-
pended to conduct or make preparations for 
any explosive nuclear weapons test that pro-
duces any yield until such time as— 
(A) the President submits to Congress an 
addendum to the report required by section 
4205 of the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 
U.S.C. 2525) that details any change to the 
condition of the United States nuclear weap-
ons stockpile from the report submitted 
under that section in the preceding year; and 
(B) there is enacted into law a joint resolu-
tion of Congress that approves the test. 
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph (1) 
does not limit nuclear stockpile stewardship 
activities that are consistent with the zero- 
yield standard and other requirements under 
law.

an amendment intended to be proposed 
to amendment SA 3867 submitted by 
Mr. REED and intended to be proposed

propriations for fiscal year 2022 for

estry credits (measured in metric tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent) that were esti-
mated to be in development, generated, or 
sold in market transactions during the pre-
ceding 4-calendar year period, and histori-
cally, in voluntary environmental credit 
markets; 
(iv) the estimated supply and demand of 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of 
offsets in the global marketplace for the 
next 4 years; 
(v) the barriers to entry due to compliance 
and verification costs described in sub-
section (g)(4)(C)(iv);

ment technologies needed to quantify long- 
term carbon sequestration in soils and from 
other activities to prevent, reduce, or miti-
gate greenhouse gas emissions in the agri-
culture and forestry sectors; 
(vii) means to reduce barriers to entry into 
voluntary environmental credit markets for

owners and the extent to which existing pro-
tocols in voluntary environmental credit 
markets allow for aggregation of projects 
among farmers, ranchers, and private forest

riod, and historically, and existing voluntary 
environmental credit markets, may be im-
peded or constricted, or achieve greater scale 
and reach, if the Department of Agriculture 
were involved, including by considering the 
role of the Department of Agriculture in re-
ducing the barriers to entry identified under 
clause (v), including by educating stake-
holders about voluntary environmental cred-
it markets;

nence, and reporting, adequately take into 
consideration and account for factors en-
countered by the agriculture and private for-
est sectors in preventing, reducing, or miti-
gating greenhouse gases or sequestering car-
bon through agriculture and forestry prac-
tices, considering variances across regions, 
topography, soil types, crop or species vari-
eties, and business models; 
(xiii) the extent to which existing proto-
cols in voluntary environmental credit mar-
kets consider options to ensure the contin-
ued valuation, through discounting or other 
means, of agriculture and forestry credits in 
the case of the practices underlying those 
credits being disrupted due to unavoidable 
events, including production challenges and 
natural disasters; and 
(xiv) opportunities for other voluntary 
markets outside of voluntary environmental 
credit markets to foster the trading, buying, 
or selling of credits that are derived from ac-
tivities that provide other ecosystem service 
benefits, including activities that improve 
water quality, water quantity, wildlife habi-
tat enhancement, and other ecosystem serv-
ices, as the Secretary determines appro-
priate;

TITLE lllll—JUDICIAL SECURITY AND 
PRIVACY 
SEC. lll01. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Daniel 
Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. lll02. PURPOSE; RULES OF CONSTRUC-
TION. 
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this title is 
to improve the safety and security of Federal 
judges, including senior, recalled, or retired 
Federal judges, and their immediate family, 
to ensure Federal judges are able to admin-
ister justice fairly without fear of personal 
reprisal from individuals affected by the de-
cisions they make in the course of carrying 
out their public duties. 
(b) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Nothing in this title shall 
be construed— 
(A) to prohibit, restrain, or limit— 
(i) the lawful investigation or reporting by 
the press of any unlawful activity or mis-
conduct alleged to have been committed by 
an at-risk individual or their immediate 
family; or 
(ii) the reporting on an at-risk individual 
or their immediate family regarding matters 
of public concern; 
(B) to impair access to decisions and opin-
ions from a Federal judge in the course of 
carrying out their public functions; or 
(C) to limit the publication or transfer of 
personally identifiable information that the 
at-risk individual or their immediate family 
member voluntarily publishes on the inter-
net after the date of enactment of this Act. 
(2) PROTECTION
OF
PERSONALLY
IDENTIFI-
ABLE
INFORMATION.—This 
title 
shall 
be 
broadly construed to favor the protection of 
the personally identifiable information of at- 
risk individuals and their immediate family. 
SEC. lll03. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Members of the Federal judiciary per-
form the important function of interpreting 
our Constitution and administering justice 
in a fair and impartial manner. 
(2) In recent years, partially as a result of 
the rise in the use of social media and online 
access to information, members of the Fed-
eral judiciary have been exposed to an in-
creased number of personal threats in con-
nection to their role. The ease of access to 
free or inexpensive sources of personally 
identifiable information has considerably 
lowered the effort required for malicious ac-
tors to discover where individuals live, where 
they spend leisure hours, and to find infor-
mation about their family members. Such 
threats have included calling a judge a trai-
tor with references to mass shootings and se-
rial killings, calling for an ‘‘angry mob’’ to 
gather outside a judge’s home and, in ref-
erence to a United States courts of appeals 
judge, stating how easy it would be to ‘‘get 
them.’’

inappropriate communications against Fed-
eral judges and other judiciary personnel in-
creased from 926 in 2015 to approximately 
4,449 in 2019. 
(4) Over the past decade, several members 
of the Federal judiciary have experienced 
acts of violence against themselves or a fam-
ily member in connection to their Federal 
judiciary role, including the murder of the 
family of United States District Judge for 
the 
Northern 
District

rival, and killing Daniel Anderl, the 20-year-

SIS AT THE SOUTHWEST LAND BOR-

lowing findings: 
(1) There were 1,300,000 illegal crossings be-
tween January, 2021, and July, 2021, across 
the Southwest land border of the United 
States. 
(2) The 212,672 migrant encounters at the 
Southwest land border in July 2021 was a 21- 
year high. 
(3) Noncitizens with criminal convictions 
are routinely encountered at ports of entry 
and between ports of entry on the Southwest 
land border. 
(4) Some of the inadmissible individuals 
encountered at the Southwest land border 
are known or suspected terrorists. 
(5) Transnational criminal organizations 
routinely move illicit drugs, counterfeit 
products, and trafficked humans across the 
Southwest land border. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the current level of illegal crossings and 
trafficking on the Southwest border rep-
resents a national security threat; 
(2) the Department of Defense has rightly 
contributed personnel to aid the efforts of 
the United States Government to address the 
crisis at the Southwest border; 
(3) the National Guard and active duty 
members of the Armed Forces are to be com-
mended for their hard work and dedication 
in their response to the crisis at the South-
west land border; and 
(4) border security is a matter of national 
security and the failure to address the crisis 
at the Southwest land border introduces sig-
nificant risk to the people of the United 
States.

(a) SUBMITTAL
OF
INFORMATION

CON-

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense 
shall— 
(A) upon request of a member of Congress

fense, not later than 30 days after the date

year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title X of divi-
sion A, add the following: 
SEC. 10ll. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING REC-
OGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS A 
THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) in September 2020, the total public debt 
outstanding of the United States was more 
than $26,000,000,000,000, resulting in a total 
interest expense of more than $371,000,000,000 
for fiscal year 2020; 
(2) in September 2019, the total public debt 
as a percentage of gross domestic product 
was about 100 percent; 
(3) leaders of the Congressional Budget Of-
fice and the Government Accountability Of-
fice have testified that— 
(A) the growth of the public debt is 
unsustainable; and 
(B) Congress must undertake extensive fis-
cal consolidation to combat that growth; 
(4) the last Federal budget surplus oc-
curred in 2001; 
(5) in fiscal year 2020, Federal tax receipts 
totaled $3,420,000,000,000, but Federal outlays 
totaled $6,652,000,000,000, leaving the Federal 
Government 
with 
a 
1-year 
deficit 
of 
$3,132,000,000,000; 
(6) since the last Federal budget surplus 
occurred in 2001, Congress— 
(A) has failed to maintain a fiscally re-
sponsible budget; and 
(B) has had to raise the debt ceiling repeat-
edly; 
(7) the Medicare Board of Trustees projects 
that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund will be depleted in 2026; 
(8) the Social Security and Medicare 
Boards of Trustees project that the Dis-
ability Insurance and the Federal Old-Age 
and Survivors Insurance Trust Funds will be 
depleted in 2026 and 2031, respectively; 
(9) heavy indebtedness increases the expo-
sure of the Federal Government to interest 
rate risks; 
(10) the credit rating of the United States 
was reduced by Standard and Poor’s from 
AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011, and has re-
mained at that level ever since; 
(11) without a targeted effort to balance 
the Federal budget, the credit rating of the 
United States will continue to fall; 
(12) improvements in the business climate 
in populous countries, and aging populations 
around the world, will likely contribute to 
higher global interest rates; 
(13) more than $7,000,000,000,000 of Federal 
debt is owned by individuals not located in 
the United States, including more than 
$1,000,000,000,000 of which is owned by individ-
uals in China; 
(14) China and the European Union are de-
veloping alternative payment systems to 
weaken the dominant position of the United 
States dollar as a reserve currency; 
(15) rapidly increasing interest rates will 
squeeze all policy priorities of the United 
States, including defense policy and foreign 
policy priorities; 
(16) the National Security Strategy of the 
United States, as of the date of enactment of 
this Act, highlights the need to reduce the 
national debt through fiscal responsibility; 
(17) on April 12, 2018, former Secretary of 
Defense James Mattis warned that ‘‘any Na-
tion that can’t keep its fiscal house in order 
eventually cannot maintain its military 
power’’; 
(18) on March 6, 2018, former Director of 
National Intelligence Dan Coats warned: 
‘‘Our 
continued 
plunge 
into 
debt 
is 
unsustainable and represents a dire future 
threat to our economy and to our national 
security’’; 
(19) on November 15, 2017, former Secre-
taries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, 
and Chuck Hagel warned: ‘‘Increase in the 
debt will, in the absence of a comprehensive 
budget that addresses both entitlements and 
revenues, force even deeper reductions in our 
national security capabilities’’; and 
(20) on September 22, 2011, former Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael 
Mullen warned: ‘‘I believe the single, biggest 
threat to our national security is debt’’. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the national debt is a threat to the na-
tional security of the United States; 
(2) 
persistent, 
structural 
deficits 
are 
unsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous;

of which military department or Defense

Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, recently, 
I 
had 
the 
pleasure 
of 
meeting 
Minnie 
Callender. Minnie was raised in South Caro-
lina with her eleven siblings. She later moved

four children, she worked as an excellent 
English teacher and school principal. Minnie 
now volunteers in Middle Township as the 
Chair of the Township’s Senior Citizen Advi-
sory Council, where she spearheaded a plan 
for voter education seminars to assist seniors 
and other residents. She also stays active in

RECOGNIZING THE AFGHAN 
COALITION 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Afghan Coalition for its out-
standing service to the Afghan-American pop-
ulation in the San Francisco Bay Area, particu-
larly during the humanitarian and immigration 
crisis related to the end of the 20-year U.S. 
military mission in Afghanistan. 
The City of Fremont, partially within the 15th 
Congressional District, is the heart of the Af-
ghan diaspora in America, the center of the 
largest Afghan American community in the 
United States. Many local families have strug-
gled to help their loved ones escape Afghani-
stan this year as the Taliban resurged. 
Founded in 1996, the Afghan Coalition long 
has been the voice for various under-served 
groups in the Afghan American community, 
providing a range of programs including, youth 
counseling and education, food banking, men-
tal health advocacy, and direct assistance to 
immigrants and refugees who settle here after 
fleeing violence and instability. 
In recent months, the coalition has hosted a 
series of town hall events with local elected of-
ficials, immigration and mental health experts, 
and other community leaders in order to keep 
the Afghan American community informed, 
comforted, and tied in with community re-
sources during these difficult times. 
Through the tireless service of Executive Di-
rector Rona Popal, the coalition’s board of di-
rectors, and its staff and volunteers, the Af-
ghan Coalition has supported and championed 
countless families in their time of need while 
also providing important public information to 
keep the Afghan people’s plight front and cen-
ter in our civic discourse. Their advocacy 
comes from a place of strength and love, and 
inspires us all to do more to help those who 
helped our troops during America’s longest 
war. 
I thank the Afghan Coalition for its continued 
work to improve lives in the Bay Area and 
around the world.

ANDREW MARTUCCI—EAGLE 
SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting An-
drew Martucci with his Eagle Scout Court of 
Honor. After Andrew noticed that the sign in 
front of his local church was eroding and in 
danger of damage, he decided to build a re-
taining wall for the soil as his Eagle Scout 
Project. In addition to the wall, Andrew con-
structed a garden around the perimeter of the 
sign to help retain the soil. Andrew’s Eagle 
Scout Project makes both his church and his 
community proud. This young man should be 
proud of his accomplishments and it was my 
honor to have had the opportunity to recog-
nize him for his service to the South Jersey 
community. God Bless Andrew and God Bless 
America.

RECOGNIZING SPOJMIE NASIRI 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Afghan-American immigration attor-
ney Spojmie Nasiri for her tireless and 
impactful work in assisting Afghans before and 
during the crisis of the Taliban’s resurgence. 
Spojmie was born in Paktia, Afghanistan, in 
1975 and emigrated with her family first to 
Germany in 1981 and then to the United 
States in 1982, refugees from the Soviet-Af-
ghan war. After growing up in Concord, Cali-
fornia, she received her Bachelor of Arts de-
gree in Political Science from the University of 
California, Davis in 1998 and her Juris Doc-
torate from Golden Gate University, School of 
Law in 2003. 
Today, she is a member of the California 
State Bar admitted to practice before the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court and the U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District of California. 
She chose to practice immigration law be-
cause she is, as she puts it, ‘‘acutely aware of 
the pain endured by immigrants separated 
from their families.’’ She has used her per-
sonal experience to more fully understand the 
challenges her clients face, and to help them 
navigate the complex immigration process. 
She has done substantial pro bono work, and 
in 2019 she founded the nonprofit We Have 
Hope Foundation to support Pashto speaking 
youth in Afghanistan and around the world by 
creating accessibility to world-class learning 
materials in Pashto. 
Her life’s work took on new dimensions in 
recent months as she has worked diligently 
from her Pleasanton, California office to help 
bring clients out of Afghanistan. Working by 
phone and email, she strove to coordinate ef-
forts with the State Department to help people 
navigate the terrifying circumstances in Kabul 
to reach the airport and escape the country. 
At the same time, Spojmie has worked with 
groups including the Afghan Coalition and the 
Jewish Community Relations Council to inform 
the public about Afghan refugees’ legal and 
practical needs for resettlement, and how best 
to help in the months and years to come. 
‘‘As an immigrant, you have a passion, a 
drive that’s unlike any other,’’ Spojmie once 
wrote. ‘‘And you want to give back.’’ 
I thank Spojmie for continuing to give back 
so much in a time of such great need. She is 
a credit to her heritage, family, profession, and 
the 15th Congressional District.

HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Harmony House in Springfield, MO, 
for their work in fighting domestic violence. 
Harmony House has partnered with photog-
rapher Randy Bacon for the project, Standing 
Together: Portraits and Stories of Domestic 
Abuse. The project features life size portraits, 
videos, and stories of survivors and those who 
work to break the cycle of domestic violence. 
The goal of the project is to highlight that 
abuse is not just a personal issue, but one 
that affects the whole community. This project 
will also show the human side of these vic-
tims, so that people can understand that they 
are not just statistics. The exhibition was on 
display through October 29 at the Pool Art 
Center Gallery located in Springfield, Missouri 
on the campus of Drury University. It will now 
be on display through November at the Randy

Bacon Studio in Springfield, Missouri. The 
hope is to show the exhibition regionally and 
ultimately to a national audience. 
Harmony House was founded in 1976 and 
has since become the largest domestic vio-
lence shelter in Missouri, with 168 beds avail-
able. In that time, they have served more than 
20,000 women, men and children who are vic-
tims of domestic violence. Their work in estab-
lishing a domestic violence hotline means that 
victims have access to resources for stopping 
abuse. Their goal is to provide temporary shel-
ter to victims of domestic violence while pro-
viding resources to them on breaking the 
cycle. 
Madam Speaker, Harmony House has spent 
the last 45 years fighting domestic violence 
and Standing Together is just the latest exam-
ple of their important work in educating the 
community about this ever-present issue. I 
commend the hard work they are doing, and 
wish them all the best in their continued ef-
forts.

MOURNING 
THE 
PASSING 
OF 
FORMER CONGRESSMAN DENNIS 
MOORE 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, it 
is with profound sadness that I rise today to 
honor the memory of former Congressman 
Dennis Moore, who passed away November 
2, 2021 at the age of 75. His long career in 
public service has left an extraordinary legacy 
that inspired many, including myself. My heart 
is with his family, his friends, and the commu-
nity that he leaves behind. 
As we mourn his loss, I’m reminded of the 
first time I met the Moores in person. I brought 
with me the pocket U.S. Constitution that I had 
carried with me all through law school—a 
pocket Constitution with an official label from 
the Office of Congressman Dennis Moore. 
After a good laugh about how on Earth I had 
managed to hold on to it all those years, he 
offered to sign my copy and gave me advice 
on my campaign. For his humor, his thought-
fulness, his dedication to public service (and 
his guitar playing skills), he will be missed. 
Dennis was born in Anthony, Kansas on No-
vember 8, 1945 and he attended high school 
in Wichita. He continued his education in Kan-
sas and received his bachelors’ degree in 
Lawrence at the University of Kansas and was 
awarded his J.D. from the Washburn Univer-
sity School of Law. 
Even before serving as Congressman, Den-
nis demonstrated a lifelong commitment to 
service at a local and national level. He was 
a captain in the United States Army intel-
ligence corps and served in the United States 
Army Reserve from 1970 to 1973. He also 
served as Johnson County District Attorney for 
over a decade. While he was District Attorney, 
he never lost a jury trial he argued and was 
instrumental in the founding of SafeHome, a 
refuge for battered women. In the late 90s, 
Dennis was elected to the Board of Trustees 
of Johnson County Community College. 
In 1998, after more than two decades of 
service in other roles, Dennis threw his hat in 
the ring to serve the Third District of Kansas 
in Congress. Although the Third District had 
not elected a Democrat for over 40 years be-
fore that, Dennis won the election against a 
Republican incumbent with over 52 percent of 
the vote. Then he won again in 2000, becom-
ing the first Democrat since 1914 to win re-
election in the Third District of Kansas. For 
over a decade, Dennis served in Congress, 
known for civility and a strong presence in the 
communities he served. He retired from Con-
gress in 2011 after completing his sixth term. 
Dennis served as a Member of Congress 
during a uniquely fraught period between 1999 
and 2011, during which Congress worked to 
respond to difficult national traumas such as 
the financial crisis of 2008. Even as Congress 
and the nation became increasingly polarized 
during this period, Dennis prioritized civility 
and bipartisanship to find solutions that would 
help average Americans. As Chair of the 
Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on 
the House Financial Services Committee, 
Dennis held hearings on the impact of the 
2008 financial crisis across the country. He 
also helped to produce the final version of the 
Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 to respond to the fi-
nancial crisis and to help America recover. 
Dennis had a traditional, common-sense ap-
proach to politics and worked hard to build 
consensus both within his party and across 
the aisle. When he first took office, Dennis 
was a member of a bipartisan group called the 
Center Aisle Caucus where Republicans and 
Democrats would come together at least once 
a month to improve cooperation and commu-
nication between the two parties. Within his 
party, he was a proud member of both the 
Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat 
Coalition, both of which focused on fiscal re-
sponsibility and promoting economic growth. 
Even though he was a pillar of centrism in 
Congress, he was never afraid to stand up for 
his values such as supporting women’s repro-
ductive rights and championing environmental 
activism at a time when climate denial was 
high. 
During his tenure as Representative, Dennis 
sought common-sense solutions on a number 
of issues that impacted his constituents. 
These issues included but were not limited to 
delivering tax relief for middle class families, 
addressing global warming, and investing in 
local needs such as transportation, flood con-
trol infrastructure, and social services. Among 
his many accomplishments in Congress, Den-
nis said that he was most proud of leading 
successful efforts to improve benefits for our 
military during the wars in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. 
After leaving Capitol Hill in 2012, Dennis 
continued to work as an advocate for causes 
close to his heart, such as increased funding 
for Alzheimer’s research, education, and sup-
port. He came back to the Hill in 2014 to pro-
vide personal testimony on the burden that 
Alzheimer’s can place on the health care sys-
tem, families, and the federal budget. In that 
hearing, Dennis expressed a belief in a Con-
gress that could come together and solve 
problems. ‘‘I really think we need to find those 
areas where we can and should find agree-
ment,’’ he said. ‘‘Good people on both sides 
work together, and there truly are good people 
on both sides.’’ His optimism, practicality, and 
hope for bipartisanship were all trademarks of 
the leader that he was. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the life of former Congressman Dennis Moore. 
Dennis was a dedicated, gracious, and prin-
cipled leader who will be remembered for his 
service to the Third District and the state of 
Kansas. To say he left big shoes to fill is an 
understatement—he leaves a legacy of fight-
ing tirelessly for what is good and right and 
decent for the people he represented.

RECOGNIZING ADRIAN KINSELLA 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Adrian Kinsella and his family for 
their ongoing commitment to our Afghan allies. 
Adrian has been on the actual and proverbial 
front lines of this fight for over a decade, first 
as a Marine, then as a friend. 
While deployed with the Marine Corps in Af-
ghanistan, Adrian met and worked with a man 
named Mohammad, who was serving as his 
platoon’s translator. They quickly gained a mu-
tual respect for each other, which evolved into 
a friendship. When Adrian came home from 
Afghanistan, he knew that Mohammad’s serv-
ice with United States forces made him a tar-
get for violence, and his family had already 
suffered disastrous consequences. 
To protect Mohammad, Adrian wanted Mo-
hammad to immigrate to the United States. 
With Adrian’s help, Mohammad arrived in 
2014. Adrian then turned his attention to Mo-
hammad’s family and focused on them until 
they were safe as well. He did all of this while 
continuing his service in the Marine Corps, at-
tending law school at University of California, 
Berkeley, and serving as a Judge Advocate 
General before returning to Berkeley for his 
LLM. Adrian worked from the halls of his law 
school, to the non-profit group International 
Refugee Assistance Project, and even the set 
of John Oliver’s TV show to try to raise aware-
ness about the plight of our Afghan allies and 
their families. He’s been a reliable resource for 
my team and me, most recently participating 
in a roundtable I hosted to gather information 
about what the community was experiencing 
as the situation in Afghanistan unfolded. He 
also 
coordinated 
with 
other 
veterans, 
strategizing ways to get our allies out and to 
safety. 
Now, as he serves as an Assistant United 
States Attorney, he, his wife Kate, an Army 
veteran herself-and their daughter all continue 
working to serve our Afghan allies arriving in 
the United States. They’re frequently waiting 
at their local airport with welcome signs for 
newly arriving families. They also collect and 
deliver household items that these families 
need to start their new lives comfortably in the 
United States. 
Adrian and Kate are truly the best of us. 
They stepped up to serve in our military when 
we needed them, and they continue to give 
back to our allies who assisted in those fights. 
They are constantly finding ways to serve our 
country and their community, and I am grate-
ful.

week, I had the pleasure of attending Jacob 
Schaad, Jr.’s 100th birthday party. Jacob start-
ed his career in journalism as a copy boy 
while in the US Army Air Corps in 1939 and 
during World War II. After his time in the mili-
tary, he became a newspaperman for the 
Cape May County Gazette. Over the years, 
Jacob’s writing has appeared in many publica-
tions, including the Philadelphia Bulletin, The 
Inquirer, The Press of Atlantic City, and The 
Gazette. As well as being a veteran journalist, 
Jacob also wrote and published books, and is 
currently working on another book, which will 
be a tribute to doctors, nurses, and other med-
ical professionals. Jacob now lives with his 
son, Mark, in the Del Haven section of Middle 
Township. God Bless Jacob and God Bless 
America.

HONORING RICHARD TRUMKA 
SPEECH OF 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, as a 
member of the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 441, a former 
labor lawyer, and current co-chair of the Con-
gressional Labor Caucus, I rise today to honor 
Richard Trumka’s life, work, and unwavering 
commitment to America’s workers. 
The son of Pennsylvania coal miners, 
Trumka was a relentless and outspoken advo-
cate for the rights of all workers. While he was 
a giant in the fight for workers’ rights, he was 
also a loving and devoted husband, father, 
and grandfather. My thoughts remain with his 
family and all those who knew and loved him. 
As President of the AFL–CIO, Richard 
Trumka fought for justice. He helped make the 
labor movement more inclusive, standing with 
immigrant and undocumented workers and 
calling out racism. 
I was proud to work with Richard Trumka 
throughout my time in Congress, and most re-
cently on the U.S. Citizenship Act. He under-
stood that our immigration system enables 
employers to exploit migrant workers with im-
punity and undermine the rights of all workers. 
He knew that building power and transforming 
the lives of working people would require bold, 
structural changes to our nation’s immigration 
and labor laws. 
From his time at the Mineworkers to his last 
days leading the AFL–CIO, Trumka created a 
legacy of championing labor. He made tan-
gible changes that improved the lives of work-
ing families, enabling more people to work in 
safer conditions and receive better pay and 
benefits. 
I will miss Richard Trumka, as will so many 
who worked with him and countless others 
whose lives were made better by his passion 
and leadership. I’m deeply proud to have had 
the honor of calling him my friend. And I am 
confident that his memory will live on in the 
progress he made for workers across Amer-
ica.

HONORING HUMBERTO LUNA 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Humberto Luna. 
Describing Humberto Luna is talking about 
perseverance, dedication, passion, optimism, 
simplicity and good humor, same that has al-
ways characterized him throughout his brilliant 
career not only as a radio host, but also as an 
actor and television host. 
This talented Zacatecano, from a very 
young age, showed great concerns about the 
Radio. He graduated from La National School 
of Voice Talents of Mexico, obtaining their 
Certificate of Aptitude granted by the Sec-
retary of Public Education through the General 
Directorate of Audiovisual Education as An-
nouncer, Chronicler and News Commentator 
in accordance with articles 84, 85 and 86 of 
the Federal Law on Radio and TV. 
And in 1970 he arrived in Los Angeles Cali-
fornia full of illusions to follow his passion for 
Radio that has led him without a doubt to be-
come one of the most popular Personalities in 
Southern California for imposing his own cre-
ative brand and staying on the air in the audi-
ence’s liking for more than four decades on 
various radio stations in the American Union. 
As a star of radio entertainment, he has 
also participated in the magical world of cin-
ema, with 27 films, on Television he co-pre-
sented on ‘‘Hablemos de Cine’’ one of the 
most successful programs of the Cadena 
Univisio´n, on Telemundo he was the host of 
his own Show ‘‘La Hora Lunatica’’ televised 
internationally. 
And on October 12, 1990, his name was re-
corded for posterity on the walk of fame of 
Hollywood making him the first hispanic an-
nouncer to obtain one of the privileged stars 
that the city awards to foreign personalities. 
There are many recognitions that for almost 
half a century of delivery have been granted, 
in 1991 the Hispanic Business Magazine 
named him ‘‘One of the 100 Most Influential 
Hispanics in United States’’ and is currently on 
the air on an important radio network. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Humberto Luna.

HON. MIKE ROGERS

Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Katie Fordham. 
Katie has lived with Parkinson’s Disease for 
the past two years, but she has not let it slow 
her down. 
This weekend, she has planned a commu-
nity walk to raise money to beat Parkinson’s. 
On top of that, Katie is the wife of Pastor 
Sam Fordham of Oak Bowery Baptist Church. 
This year, Oak Bowery Baptist and the sur-
rounding communities were devasted by tor-
nadoes on March 25th. 
Katie worked tirelessly to organize volun-
teers, coordinate meals, source furniture and 
find tradesmen from Ohatchee to Wellington to 
Pleasant Valley. She spent countless hours 
helping victims and ensuring people had what 
they needed. 
She established a Facebook page so folks 
could post their needs and collected gift cards 
from major businesses to distribute to tornado 
victims. Seven months later, she is still coordi-
nating and helping victims connect with re-
sources. 
Katie home schools her three children. Their 
family enjoys camping. She is known for bak-
ing her huge cinnamon rolls. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Katie Fordham for her commitment to

RECOGNIZING 
EDILBERTO 
CANSECO AS MY CONSTITUENT 
OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize Oceanside 
resident and Vista Family Health Center Phy-
sician Assistant, Edilberto Canseco, for my 
October Constituent of the Month. Edilberto 
was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and immigrated 
to the United States in 1991 at the age of 
three. Growing up, Edilberto’s family empha-
sized the value of hard work and the impor-
tance of serving others. Embodying the Amer-
ican Dream, Edilberto took these lessons and 
his passion for science and completed an 
Emergency Medical Technician School Pro-
gram at Palomar College. He then obtained a 
Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Cal 
State University San Marcos and graduated 
with a Master’s in Medical Science from Stan-
ford’s School of Medicine Primary Care Pro-
gram. 
During his time at Palomar Community Col-
lege, Edilberto participated in the school’s 
dedicated program to inspire Latino students 
like himself, and he carried those lessons on 
throughout his life. Years later, Edilberto found 
himself in one of the most challenging times of 
his academic career as only one of three 
Latino students in a cohort of 50 working to-
wards their Master’s degree at Stanford. De-
spite the challenges, Edilberto persisted and 
used the lessons he learned from the support 
programs at Palomar College to be success-
ful. Seeking to honor the values his parents in-
stilled in him and pay the lessons learned for-
ward, Edilberto dedicated his career to work-
ing within the Latino community and helping 
others. 
Now in his fourth year at Vista Family 
Health Center as a Physician Associate in pri-
mary care, Edilberto tirelessly works on the 
frontlines of the COVID–19 pandemic. He 
sees himself in his patients and understands 
the hesitancy within the Latino community to 
get vaccinated, but he works diligently to pro-
mote vaccinations and provides each patient 
with high quality, culturally relevant, and lin-
guistically appropriate care. As a dedicated 
member of his community, Edilberto is able to 
fulfill his passion of helping others and being 
a part of the solution amid the pandemic. 
Following Hispanic Heritage Month, I am 
proud to continue lifting up Latino voices like 
Edilberto Canseco who contribute to our 
unique and diverse district. I’m so grateful for 
CA–49 residents who dedicate their lives to 
the betterment of our residents, especially dur-
ing this pandemic, and I’m proud to honor 
Edilberto Canseco as my October Constituent 
of the Month.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF JOHN 
EDWARD MCCLURE 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of John Edward 
McClure. A true pioneer in what is considered 
the final frontier, John led the business devel-
opment team that brought the ON-STAR auto-
mobile safety and communication system to 
reality. Through his vision for the practical and 
purposeful application of what was then an 
emerging technology, thousands of lives have 
been saved and countless motorists have 
been kept safe thanks to this technology. 
John and his team helped exploit the nas-
cent Internet of Things, or how machines talk 
to machines, to create ON STAR, one of the 
first communication systems to exploit this 
technology. ON STAR achieved its goals of 
providing security, enhancing productivity, and 
monitoring vehicle operation and maintenance 
for motorists. 
A true entrepreneur, John started numerous 
companies including an asset tracking com-
pany using GPS and other satellite tech-
nologies to monitor cargo and other materials 
in transit. Mr. McClure’s quest to constantly 
push the boundaries of technology led him to 
focus on helping youth acquire a thirst for dis-
covery. He mentored individuals and led stu-
dent groups sharing his mantra that there ‘‘are 
no Can’t Dos in life, only Can Dos!’’ 
Combining his passion for aerospace and 
education, he introduced the NASA CubeSat 
initiative to a group of Nebraska middle- and 
high-school students. He helped pair them 
with undergraduate mentors from the Univer-
sity of Nebraska Lincoln. Together the team 
proposed an experiment that NASA has ac-
cepted for a future mission to orbit earth. 
Known as the Big Red Satellite Team, this 
group will carry on John’s mission to have this 
historic-first CubeSat designed and built in Ne-
braska. The team will test cutting edge solar 
cell technology. 
Always looking beyond the horizon, John’s 
ultimate goal is for the Big Red Satellite 
project to serve as a catalyst for the develop-
ment of STEM careers and ultimately help 
build an aerospace industry in Nebraska. An 
accomplished fixed wing and hot air balloon 
pilot, John never stopped reaching for the 
stars. His words and his actions clearly com-
municated his primary mission: create oppor-
tunities that give kids an opportunity to suc-
ceed. 
John McClure passed away September 15, 
2021. I offer my condolences to his entire fam-
ily. John’s many achievements will continue to 
impact Nebraska well into the future. A future 
that John sought to improve by helping young 
students discover their abilities and believe 
that anything is possible. His life’s work has 
helped people in every state of this union, and 
his legacy of encouraging others to make their 
dreams a reality will be carried on by those he 
inspired.

CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF HOT SPRINGS AREA 
COMMUNITY FOUNDATION 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the work of the Hot Springs 
Area Community Foundation. 
The Hot Springs Area Community Founda-
tion is celebrating its 30th year of giving. This 
foundation was started when 15 local commu-
nity members wanted to improve their commu-
nity; now, it is one of twenty-nine affiliates of 
the Arkansas Community Foundation oper-
ating in the top tier of affiliates. Since its in-
ception in 1991, the Hot Springs Area Com-
munity Foundation has given out over $17 mil-
lion in grants to originations in the greater Hot 
Springs area. In 2021 alone, the Hot Springs 
Area Community Foundation has awarded just 
under $250,000 to those in need. 
These grant dollars have allowed the com-
munity to combat many issues, including food 
insecurity and other health and poverty-related 
problems. In addition to food and health 
issues, the Hot Springs Area Community 
Foundation is addressing the issue of illiteracy 
in our area. As part of the statewide Grade- 
Level Reading initiative, the Foundation works 
with community leaders, parents, and edu-
cators to have children reading at grade level 
by the end of third grade. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Hot Springs 
Area Community Foundation, its current and 
former board members, and those donors who 
have allowed it to serve the community for the 
last 30 years.

Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the five recipients of the 26th 
District of Texas’ 2020 Congressional Vet-

Association 
of

gross benefits to Denton County Veterans, 
and the foundation of both the Veterans Com-

Korean and Vietnam Wars. During the Korean 
War, Mr. Cook was assigned to the USS Mis-

played a pivotal role in multiple offensive ma-
neuvers as part of the famed Task Force 77. 
Mr. Cook was promoted to the highest enlisted

the Town Council in 1994 and was then ap-
pointed Mayor in 1995. The citizens of Double 
Oak re-elected Mr. Cook as Mayor twice. In 
2010, he was appointed as Mayor Emeritus.

U.S. Marine Corps one month after the 9/11 
terrorist attacks, and fought as a member of 
the 1st Battalion, 23rd Marine Corps Regi-

in founding the non-profit ‘‘22 Kill’’ to bring 
public awareness to the alarming rate of vet-
eran suicides and he currently serves as CEO

I am truly privileged to thank all five of our

Armed Forces and their whole-hearted dedica-
tion to their communities following their military 
careers. Their leadership, devotion, and sac-
rifice truly exemplify the finest traditions of the

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this

Costantino with his Eagle Scout Court of 
Honor. Nate had noticed the Gilda’s Club or-
ganization in Northfield lacked a recreational 
area for the youth who utilized the building. 
For his Eagle Scout Project, Nate addressed 
this issue and constructed a playground area 
in the back of the Gilda’s Club building. This 
playground will be enjoyed by Northfield resi-
dents for years to come. This young man 
should be proud of his accomplishments and 
it was my honor to have had the opportunity 
to recognize him for his service to the South

REMEMBERING CHARLIE ARTHUR 
ZINK 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Charlie Arthur Zink, who 
passed away on June 20, 2021. 
On March 3, 2006, Charlie was born in Bos-
ton, Massachusetts, to Eric and Alyssa Zink. 
Charlie was a vibrant young child with so 
many passions in life. Playing the video game 
Planet Coaster, he pursued his dream of be-
coming a world-renowned roller-coaster de-
signer. As part of his summer RV travel plans, 
he planned to visit Cedar Point and other 
amusement parks along the way to ride the 
steepest, fastest and craziest coasters in the 
world. 
Charlie was a rising 10th grader at Bedford 
High School. Inspired by many Bedford edu-
cators, Charlie was looking forward to his new 
classes in the fall. He was proud to work at 
his family’s restaurant, the Puritan Backroom, 
and he represented the fifth generation to bus 
tables and work in the kitchen. 
Charlie was a great athlete but loved bas-
ketball more than anything. He loved to play 
pickup with his siblings in the backyard under 
the lights, and he played as part of many 
teams over his short career. 
Charlie is survived by his parents, three sib-
lings, and two pets whom he loved dearly: 13- 
year-old Annie, 11-year-old Eva, 8-year-old 
Oliver, Wilson the dog, and Hazel the cat. 
Charlie’s uncle, Mr. Chris Pappas, represents 
New Hampshire’s first district and loved his 
first nephew with all his heart. Alongside Mr. 
Pappas and his family, we join them in hon-
oring the wonderful and inspiring life of 
Charles Zink. 
Charlie will also be remembered for being a 
fiercely loyal companion, a son, sibling, and 
friend. We will never forget his curiosity and 
love for adventure, memories that will continue 
to inspire everyone who knew him.

amazing diversity is a blessing. That the peo-
ple and cultures that have come from so many 
places should be celebrated. And, importantly, 
that the celebration of that diversity can be a 
force for uniting us. 
Since 1996 the Asia Pacific Cultural Center 
has served as that unifying force in our re-
gion—a center of cultural exchange. It has 
provided programs to support, celebrate, and 
honor the Asian and Pacific Islander people. It 
has given us all an opportunity to celebrate 
art, education, culture, and cuisine—some of 
the core elements of everyday lives that have 
been challenged over the course of the last 
couple of years. It has brought us together. 
Through it all, over the last quarter of a cen-
tury, the APCC has not only endured—it has 
thrived. Over the years, so many of us have 
learned so much from APCC programs. Per-
sonally, I have participated in traditional cere-
monies at Samoan Cultural Days and at the 
Korean Chuseok Festival. I got to join with my 
youngest daughter in making dumplings (I was 
terrible at it, but my kiddo was terrific). I’ve 
joined the APCC in prayer and healing after 
tragic moments in our country. And I’ve joined 
them in great joy and celebration. And I know 
I’m not alone. Indeed, by hosting cultural 
events and activities, sponsoring youth pro-
grams, and conducting outstanding outreach, 
the Asia Pacific Cultural Center has become a 
pillar of our community. 
Through its work, the APCC helps us live up 
to a vision laid out by Gandhi when he said, 
‘‘I do not want my house to be walled in on all 
sides and my windows to be stuffed.’’ He said, 
‘‘I want the culture of all lands to be blown 
about my house as freely as possible.’’ The 
Asia Pacific Cultural Center has brought the 
cultures of 47 countries into our home. The 
APCC has made our community stronger. 
I would like to recognize and congratulate 
the organization’s tremendous leadership, in-
cluding Executive Director Lua Pritchard, 
President and Founder Patsy Surh O’Connell, 
the board, and every person in our community 
that has supported their extraordinary work. It 
matters. 
As a representative for our region in our Na-
tion’s capital, I want to thank the APCC for its 
partnership and congratulate the organization 
for 25 years of service and dedication to our 
community. I look forward to working with the 
Asia Pacific Cultural Center for years to come. 
It is an honor to represent them and our 
region.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, our small 
business community in South Jersey was 
heavily impacted by the global pandemic, just 
as many other small businesses were across 
the nation. However, one local business serv-
ing Cape May County made it through the 
pandemic and has recently expanded with a 
second location. Jeff and Courtney Wallace, 
owners of Box-It Fitness, continue to spread 
health and wellness across Cape May County. 
Box-It Fitness offers a diverse selection of 
boxing and fitness classes every day. Con-
gratulations to Jeff and Courtney on the grand 
opening of the second Box-It Fitness location. 
God bless Jeff and Courtney and God bless

RECOGNITION 
OF 
AMERICAN 
VETERANS COLIN POWELL POST 
910 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the many contributions of American 
Veterans (AMVETS) Post 910, named for 
Colin Powell, in the City of Detroit in Michi-
gan’s 13th Congressional District. 
The members of the Colin Powell Post 
came together with a purpose, to help the vet-
erans and their families in creating a better 
quality of life and to make a positive change 
in the community. Post 910 has focused its 
mission 
on 
assisting 
homeless 
veterans 
across Detroit and Wayne County. They have 
hosted countless events in support of those 
who have served our country in the military. 
They have regularly offered a listening ear and 
fellowship to veteran patients at John Dingell 
Veterans Administration Hospital in Detroit. 
In addition to its charitable work, Post 910 
has worked to strengthen its ties to local high 
school 
Reserve 
Officers’ 
Training 
Corps 
(ROTC) programs. They have recognized 
ROTC students’ achievements at schools 
across Detroit. Still, the Post 910 members 
devote countless hours to community events, 
participating in local parades and events hon-
oring the service of our veterans. They dedi-
cate their time all year round to giving back to 
the community by hosting holiday toy drives 
for local children, Thanksgiving meals for 
those in need, and so much more. 
Please join me in recognizing Detroit’s Colin 
Powell AMVETS Post 910 for their many out-
standing contributions to the communities of 
Detroit and 13th District Strong.

HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise along with my colleagues, Rep. BILL 
PASCRELL and Rep. DAN KILDEE, to commemo-
rate the successful federal career of Ana Hino-
josa, Executive Director for Trade Remedy 
and Law Enforcement at Customs and Border 
Protection’s (CBP) Office of Trade. Ms. Hino-
josa retires after more than 33 years of serv-
ice at CBP. 
As Members of the Committee on Ways and 
Means, we would like to commend Ms. Hino-
josa on her efforts to support and lead CBP’s 
trade functions. She has served in many 
trade-related roles in her time at CBP, includ-
ing at the World Customs Organization 
(WCO), where she led the directorate that is 
responsible for assisting WCO Members in im-
plementing effective and efficient controls, en-
suring fair and accurate revenue collection, 
and protecting society by intercepting and sup-
pressing illicit and criminal activities. 
Ms. Hinojosa has also played an instru-
mental role in CBP’s enforcement of the prohi-
bition on the importation of goods made with 
forced labor. As Members who worked hard to 
close the ‘‘consumptive demand’’ loophole in 
the import ban in 2016, we recognize that the 
key to the effectiveness of the improved law 
would be strong enforcement. 
Ms. Hinojosa has been critical in leading 
CBP’s efforts in this regard. During numerous 
congressional briefings, Ms. Hinojosa dem-
onstrated her work ethic and passion for this 
issue, supporting enforcement on a wide array 
of products from a diverse group of countries. 
While much more remains to be done on 
forced labor, we applaud Ms. Hinojosa’s work 
to dramatically expand and improve CBP’s en-
forcement efforts on this critically important 
issue. 
Ms. Hinojosa was also a Past President of 
Executive Women in Government, which is an 
organization that focuses on helping women in 
middle- to upper-level management positions 
reach Executive level positions in the U.S. 
Government. 
We wish to congratulate Ms. Hinojosa on 
her retirement and express of gratitude for her 
many years of public service, particularly her 
commitment to enforcing the prohibition of 
forced labor imports. We wish her the best in 
her future endeavors.

and other items. So, with this in mind, for his 
Eagle Scout Project he decided to organize 
and renovate the entryway. Zachary made the 
entryway more welcoming by discarding of all 
the clutter, removing the bookshelves, and 
painting the area. This young man should be 
proud of his accomplishments and it was my 
honor to have the opportunity to recognize him 
for his service to both his church community 
and the entire South Jersey community. God 
Bless Zachary and God Bless America.

RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE DELAWARE RIVER 
BASIN COMMISSION 
HON. ANTONIO DELGADO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the contributions of the 
Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC). 
On this day 60 years ago, when concurrent 
compact legislation ratified by Delaware, New 
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the U.S. 
Congress became law, the DRBC was born. 
It was a seminal moment in water resource 
management: it marked the first time that the 
federal government and a consortium of states 
formed a regional body to establish a coordi-
nated approach to manage a river system. 
The DRBC—made up of the four governors 
and a senior U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
official—work collectively to protect the basin’s 
water quality and supply allocation, address 
droughts and flooding, and ensure that future 
generations can enjoy all that the river has to 
offer. 
The Delaware River is the longest un- 
dammed river in the U.S. east of the Mis-
sissippi. It provides drinking water for more 
than 17 million Americans. Its watershed gen-
erates $25 billion in annual economic activity 
and contributes $21 billion worth of ecosystem 
goods and services each year. It’s critically im-
portant that we protect this precious resource. 
That’s why I started the first-ever Congres-
sional Delaware River Watershed Caucus with 
my colleague, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick 
of Pennsylvania. Our caucus supports con-
servation efforts for the basin and raises the 
profile of this ecological gem and economic 
driver. I look forward to continuing to work with 
the DRBC on our shared goals, and I con-
gratulate the Commission on 60 years of out-
standing work.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I was un-

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA BOARD OF ZONING 
ADJUSTMENT HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Board of Zon-
ing Adjustment Home Rule Act. This bill would 
give the District of Columbia the authority to 
appoint all members of the D.C. Board of Zon-
ing Adjustment (Board), except when the 
Board is performing functions regarding an ap-
plication by a foreign mission with respect to 
a chancery. The Board issues special excep-
tions, or variances, to the regulations issued 
by the D.C. Zoning Commission (Commis-
sion). This bill does not alter the authority of 
the Board. 
Like every other jurisdiction in the United 
States, the District should be free to set its 
own local land-use policies. As the District 
continues to contend with rapid population 
growth and economic development, it is more 
important than ever that the members of the 
Board are accountable to District residents 
and local elected officials. 
Under current law, in general, the Board 
consists of a representative each from the Na-
tional Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) 
and the Commission, each of whom may be a 
federal official, and three mayoral appointees, 
subject to D.C. Council approval. The Board 
has no authority over federal property. 
Under current law, when the Board is per-
forming functions regarding an application by 
a foreign mission with respect to the location, 
expansion or replacement of a chancery, the 
Board consists of the Executive Director of 
NCPC, the Director of the National Park Serv-
ice, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
the Interior or the Administrator of General 
Services, as designated by the President, and 
the three mayoral appointees. This bill does 
not change this composition. 
This is an important step to recognize and 
increase home rule for the District, and I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill.

JR.—SALEM 
COUNTY DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN 
2021 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, we, in 
South Jersey, cherish our active military and 
veteran community. Their sacrifices do not go 
unnoticed, and their continued work is forever 
appreciated. Veterans, like Joseph Hannagan, 
Jr., embody the principle of Semper Fidelis. 
He has dedicated the last 10 years of his life 
to serving veterans in Salem County. Semper 
Fidelis means ‘‘always faithful,’’ and Joseph 
has been nothing but faithful to the Military 
and Veteran community. Congratulations, Jo-
seph, on becoming Salem County’s Distin-
guished Citizen, he certainly deserves it. God 
bless Joseph and God bless America. 
IN GRATITUDE TO FADWA 
HAMMOUD 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 2, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my constituent, Fadwa 
Hammoud, who made history on October 5, 
2021, becoming the first Arab American 
woman to argue before the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Brown v. Davenport, as the Solicitor 
General of Michigan. Ms. Hammoud is a true 
trailblazer, and we are so proud of her work 
and career as a Michigander. 
Prior to her role as Solicitor General of 
Michigan, Ms. Hammoud clerked for the Hon-
orable Judge George Steeh on the United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Michigan. She also served as an assistant 
prosecuting attorney at the Wayne County 
Prosecutor’s Office. Under Wayne County 
Prosecutor Kym L. Worthy, Ms. Hammoud es-
tablished the Business Protection Unit and 
prosecuted cases involving criminal enter-
prises, homicides, financial crimes, and iden-
tity thefts. 
On February 18, 2019, Ms. Hammoud took 
the oath of office to be sworn in as the first 
Solicitor General of Michigan making history. 
In her role, she oversaw the investigation re-
lated to the Flint Water Crisis and many other 
important cases. 
On October 5, Ms. Hammoud argued on be-
half of Petitioner Brown that the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit should have ap-
plied the precedent established by Chapman 
v. California in a case involving habeas cor-
pus. 
Fighting for all Michiganders and delivering 
results, Ms. Hammoud exemplifies what it 
means to be a public servant. Her work is in-
spiring and an amazing example for women in 
Michigan and across the country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the outstanding contributions 
Ms. Hammoud has made to the Michigan 
community and our country at large.

Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor our nation’s veterans and help shine 
a light on the struggles they continue to face 
after returning home from their service in uni-
form. I want to thank my colleague from Michi-
gan for giving us this opportunity to speak 
here today. 
With Veterans Day just around the corner, it 
is important that all Americans take time to re-
flect on the sacrifices these courageous men 
and women, and their families, have made for 
the United States. This is a solemn occasion 
when we come together as a country to ap-
preciate the selfless service and celebrate the 
bravery of these heroes. 
I have had many conversations with vet-
erans in my district about the challenges they 
continue to face once they have returned 
home. Many have been longstanding for gen-
erations: the physical and emotional wounds

of combat, obstacles in accessing VA care 
and benefits, and debilitating health conditions 
resulting from exposure to burn pits and other 
toxic hazards. 
But recently, there has been an increased 
call to address other, less talked about chal-
lenges, including the mental health impacts of 
processing what we all witnessed in Afghani-
stan over the last few months. 
I am proud to have joined my colleagues in 
leading several bipartisan pieces of legislation 
to help address some of these challenges, but 
there is much more to be done. We have an 
urgent moral obligation to take care of the 
men and women who have served and sac-
rificed to defend our nation, and I am com-
mitted to continuing this crucial work with my 
colleagues here in Congress. 
Today, I want to express my deepest grati-
tude and appreciation to all of our nation’s vet-
erans, and I encourage all Americans to reach 
out to veterans in their life and let them know 
that they are valued and that they are not 
alone. We will never forget those who have 
answered the call to serve this country in uni-
form, and we honor them all here today.
