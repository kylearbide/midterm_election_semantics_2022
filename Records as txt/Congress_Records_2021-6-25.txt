Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JUNE 25, 2021 
No. 111 
Senate 
The Senate was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Monday, June 28, 2021, at 9 a.m.

The House met at 9 a.m. and was

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is 
Your name in all the Earth. Your glory 
fills the Earth and is exalted above the 
heavens. 
All we need do is look around us: at 
the intricate details and the artistry of 
nature, at the handiwork that has 
woven the tapestry of the stars ar-
ranged above us at night, at the perfect 
order of the rising and setting of the 
Sun and the orbit of the Moon. 
To ponder the complexity of Your 
creation is overwhelming. Who are we, 
O God, that You should even take no-
tice of us? 
Why, when there is so much to tend 
to on this Earth, would You seek so 
passionately to care for us? 
And yet, You have given us dominion 
over all of this. You have entrusted us 
with the stewardship of all these won-
derful resources. 
O Lord, our Lord, how abundant is 
Your grace. How boundless is Your 
love. How excellent is Your name in all 
the Earth. 
May we take the opportunity to 
enjoy all your blessings, and may we be 
worthy of the responsibility You have 
laid on us. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen. 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas led the Pledge 
of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
NEED FOR AFFORDABLE 
CHILDCARE 
(Ms. GARCIA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to bring attention to 
the crisis caused by the lack of 
childcare in my district and across the 
country. Access to affordable childcare 
is critical for working families across 
the country and in my district. 
We all have heard of places without 
grocery stores referred to as food 
deserts. Well, half of American families 
live in areas lacking childcare facili-
ties. They are living in childcare 
deserts. 
The situation is even worse in Latino 
communities, as 78 percent live in 
childcare deserts. 
As you can see on this chart by my 
side, this is my district. The orange 
and the dark colors represent areas 
that have no access to childcare. 
Eighty-two percent of the children in 
my district have no access to childcare. 
This is a childcare desert. This impacts 
disproportionately 
communities 
of 
color. This is unacceptable. 
As a Nation, we must invest in 
childcare. High-quality childcare im-
proves outcomes for children, parents, 
and neighborhoods. We must act and 
we must act now. 
f 
NEED FOR AN ORIGIN OF COVID–19 
INVESTIGATION 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, my col-
leagues across the aisle appear eager to 
investigate and hold hearings on just 
about anything, but when 200 Repub-
licans and I urged the Speaker to in-
vestigate the origins of COVID–19 a 
month ago, the Speaker did nothing. 
Evidence 
is 
now 
mounting 
that 
COVID–19 may have escaped from a lab 
in Wuhan, China, and the Chinese Com-
munist Party worked to cover it up. 
Pointblank, this coverup by the CCP 
cost American lives, shuttered tens of

thousands of businesses, and altered 
life as we know it. 
Yet, here we stand, almost a month 
later, and we are still no closer to a 
House investigation, not even a hear-
ing to get to the bottom of what hap-
pened. 
The simple fact of the matter is that 
the Chinese Communist Party is an ad-
versary, and they have not been truth-
ful or honest about anything, espe-
cially not their role in covering up the 
origins of COVID–19. 
Since the very beginning, the Chinese 
Communist Party has blocked Amer-
ican scientists from participating in a 
full-scope investigation, refused access 
to reporters from Wuhan, manipulated 
the World Health Organization’s report 
on the origins of the virus, and strong- 
armed anyone who disagreed with the 
narrative they invented. 
It is infuriating that Speaker PELOSI 
and House Democrats are willing to 
cover for the Chinese Communist Party 
and let them off the hook for this dis-
aster, simply to achieve a political end. 
We cannot and should not accept 
anything less than absolute certainty 
about the origins of COVID–19. We 
must investigate, hold China account-
able, and ensure nothing like this ever 
happens again. 
f 
OUR NUCLEAR LEGACY IN THE 
MARSHALL ISLANDS 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, July 
marks the 75th anniversary of the first 
U.S. nuclear test in the Marshall Is-
lands, a tragedy that continues today. 
Orange County is proud to be home 
to one of the oldest Marshallese-Amer-
ican 
communities. 
But 
why 
the 
Marshallese came to the United States 
is a disgraceful chapter in our Nation’s 
history. From 1946 to 1958, the United 
States conducted 67 nuclear tests in 
the Marshall Islands. 
We deceived the Marshallese, using 
them as guinea pigs to study the ef-
fects of radiation. We turned ancestral 
lands into dumping grounds for nuclear 
waste. 
We still haven’t done the bare min-
imum to make this right. We estab-
lished a tribunal for compensation but 
provided less than 10 percent of the 
money owed. We don’t even translate 
environmental 
studies 
into 
Marshallese. 
Our nuclear legacy in the Marshall 
Islands is at the nexus of President 
Biden’s top priorities: racial justice, 
healthcare, climate change, U.S. global 
reputation, 
and 
countering 
China 
through diplomacy. We must commit 
across party lines to make this right. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the 2 million 
lives saved by the Hyde amendment. 
For decades, Presidents of both par-
ties, including Presidents Clinton and 
Obama, have worked across the aisle to 
include the Hyde amendment in the 
Federal budget, which is a temporary 
protection barring the use of taxpayer 
funds to pay for abortions. 
However, this year, while calling for 
unity, the President is pushing for a $6 
trillion budget with no protections for 
the unborn or for the taxpayer who will 
foot the bill. This is an action where 
everyone loses. 
Instead of callously endangering the 
lives of millions of women and children 
at taxpayer expense, we should be 
fighting tooth and nail for their protec-
tions. 
By making the Hyde amendment per-
manent, that is exactly what H.R. 18 
will do. 
That is why I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committees on Energy and 
Commerce, Ways and Means, and the 
Judiciary be discharged from further 
consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
NEGUSE). Under guidelines consistently 
issued by successive Speakers, as re-
corded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
f 
173 DAYS OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, today is day 
173 of this Congress and the 150th of the 
Biden administration. These days have 
been spent governing to repair our 
global standing, to accelerate our vac-
cination program, and to boost a strug-
gling economy. 
With the American Rescue Plan, we 
have governed to build back better for 
red districts, for blue districts, for all 
districts. 
In my district alone, here are some of 
the ways we have begun to build back 
better: with over $87 million for our 
school districts, $137 million for local 
governments, $1.5 million for Head 
Start programs, and the child tax cred-
it will send an average of $2,400 to 
37,000 families. 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
has received $7.3 billion, a trans-
formative amount, that must address 
educational and opportunity inequi-
ties. 
In these 100 days, we have proven we 
can live up to a responsibility to gov-
ern. As we begin to emerge from this 
pandemic, we are at a turning point 
where we can build on the success of 
the American Rescue Plan, find infra-
structure investments, and look to-
ward a stronger, more compassionate 
future. 
ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
June as Alzheimer’s and Brain Aware-
ness Month. 
With more than 6 million Americans 
living with Alzheimer’s and nearly 50 
million people living with Alzheimer’s 
and other dementias worldwide, it is 
important to raise awareness. The 
more we know about Alzheimer’s, the 
more action we can inspire. 
Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause 
of death in the United States, and it is 
the only one of the top ten causes of 
death without any methods for pre-
venting, curing, or slowing it down. 
Alzheimer’s related deaths increased 
by 16 percent during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
The diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is not 
only devastating to those who are diag-
nosed, but also to their caregivers and 
loved ones. My own mom lived with 
Alzheimer’s for 10 years. It stole her 
memories and finally stole her life. 
In 2021, Alzheimer’s care will cost our 
Nation $355 billion, and by 2050, costs 
are expected to rise to more than $1.1 
trillion. 
Currently, over 11 million Americans 
provide unpaid care to family and 
friends living with Alzheimer’s and 
other dementias. 
Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. 
Let’s join the fight. Let’s take the 
pledge to raise awareness about Alz-
heimer’s disease and to never stop 
searching for a cure. 
f 
URGENT NEED TO CURB METHANE 
EMISSIONS 
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, 
methane emissions are accelerating 
climate change and harming our com-
munities, and we are moving in the 
wrong direction. 
After the Trump administration re-
pealed limitations on emissions of 
methane, we saw the largest yearly in-
crease of methane emissions on record 
in 2020. We must get back on track. 
It is urgent that we restore regula-
tions to limit methane emissions. 
Methane is 80 times more potent than 
carbon dioxide. We cannot move quick-
ly enough. We have to act now. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the legislation that we will be con-
sidering today, to curb these dangerous 
emissions and protect our commu-
nities.

House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
Sunday is National Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder Awareness Day, a day 
to bring attention to a disorder that af-
fects countless of my fellow veterans. 
PTSD is a disorder that tens of thou-
sands of Americans are diagnosed with 
every year. Sadly, our veterans and Ac-
tive Duty servicemembers are among 
those that face the toughest challenge. 
As a 24-year Army veteran, and as a 
member of the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, I was proud to work to-
gether with my colleagues across the 
aisle in addressing PTSD by intro-
ducing two pieces of legislation to help 
veterans get the mental healthcare 
they both deserve and need. The Sgt. 
Ketchum 
Rural 
Veterans 
Mental 
Health Act will expand VA mental 
healthcare for veterans in rural areas. 
It passed the House last month and 
unanimously passed the Senate last 
night. 
I am now proud to cosponsor the re-
cently 
reintroduced 
Brandon 
Act, 
which will make it easier for veterans 
and servicemembers to seek confiden-
tial mental health resources. 
We, as Members of Congress, have the 
ability to take action, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to support the mental 
health of our veterans and our service-
members through passing the Brandon 
Act.

AMERICA SHOULD REDUCE 
DEPENDENCY ON CHINA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, China, 
led by the Chinese Communist Party, 
has inflicted more damage and suf-
fering on the world and even its own 
people than is even calculable. 
Accountability for its action, or 
timely inactions, on the Wuhan virus is 
necessary. Transparency in how re-
search labs conduct business is essen-
tial in holding those responsible that 
allowed the leak of extremely dan-
gerous byproducts that have cost mul-
titudes of lives and inflicted many tril-
lions in economic harm upon the world. 
The U.S. must zero out its depend-
ence on China for so much of what we 
use and need in everyday life. We must 
produce our own pharmaceutical prod-
ucts, our own rare-earth products from 
our own mines, our own manufac-
turing. 
We must prohibit the gain-of-func-
tion research that likely led to the 
Wuhan virus being unleashed on the 
world. 
Overhaul the World Health Organiza-
tion and our relationship with it. 
Prohibit 
National 
Institutes 
of 
Health funding to those who don’t have 
the United States and American peo-
ples’ best interests and wellness at 
heart. 
Reimpose visa sanctions on China. 
And, certainly, why give China a le-
gitimate stage to the world via the 
Olympics? 
The Olympics rightly should be rebid 
and moved in time for 2022 to countries 
that respect and revere human rights 
and right to basic freedoms from op-
pression. Otherwise, we give it all a 
green light and a tacit stamp of ap-
proval.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL 
OF 
THE 
RULE 
SUBMITTED BY THE ENVIRON-
MENTAL 
PROTECTION 
AGENCY 
RELATING TO ‘‘OIL AND NAT-
URAL 
GAS 
SECTOR: 
EMISSION 
STANDARDS FOR NEW, RECON-
STRUCTED, 
AND 
MODIFIED 
SOURCES REVIEW’’ 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, I call up 
the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 14) pro-
viding for congressional disapproval 
under chapter 8 of title 5, United 
States Code, of the rule submitted by 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
relating to ‘‘Oil and Natural Gas Sec-
tor: Emission Standards for New, Re-
constructed, and Modified Sources Re-
view’’, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the joint 
resolution is considered read. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
S.J. RES. 14 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress 
assembled, 
That 
Congress 
dis-
approves the rule submitted by the Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency relating to ‘‘Oil and Natural Gas 
Sector: Emission Standards for New, Recon-
structed, and Modified Sources Review’’ (85 
Fed. Reg. 57018 (September 14, 2020)), and 
such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for 
one hour, equally divided and con-
trolled by the Chair and the ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce or their respec-
tive designees. 
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) and the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S.J. Res. 
14. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to 
consider S.J. Res. 14, a joint resolution 
providing for congressional disapproval 
of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s 2020 methane rescission rule. This 
Trump EPA action removed direct Fed-
eral limits on methane pollution from 
new and modified oil and gas facilities, 
essentially increasing pollution and ex-
acerbating the climate crisis. 
While we are voting on the Senate 
version of this joint resolution today, I 
want to thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives DEGETTE, PETERS, and 
LAMB, for leading this effort in the 
House. The House version of this reso-
lution advanced out of the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
earlier 
this 
month. 
Mr. Speaker, methane is a potent cli-
mate-disrupting greenhouse gas that is 
responsible 
for 
approximately 
one- 
third of our warming and resulting cli-
mate disruption. Addressing methane 
is an urgent and essential step to miti-
gate climate change. 
The greatest and most cost-effective 
way to curb methane pollution over 
the next decade is through the fossil 
fuel sector, which is the largest indus-
trial source of methane emissions in 
the United States. 
Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA 
has a responsibility and obligation to 
protect public health and welfare from 
dangerous climate pollution like meth-
ane. But because of the Trump rescis-
sion rule, there are now no clean air 
protections in place to curb dangerous 
methane pollution from the oil and gas 
sector. 
What is more, the Trump rule cre-
ated massive regulatory loopholes that 
shield the vast majority of climate pol-
lution produced by the oil and gas in-
dustry from critical Federal standards 
for years to come. 
The Trump action was a thinly veiled 
attempt to block regulation of the 
worst oil and gas industry actors at the 
expense of our health, our safety, and 
our planet; and it came at a time when 
we need these protections more than 
ever. 
Mr. Speaker, without bold action to 
curb emissions from the hundreds of 
thousands of sources in the oil and gas 
sector, methane pollution will continue 
to cause significant harm to public 
health, threaten the stability of our 
economy, and compromise the well- 
being of future generations and the 
planet. 
That is why this joint resolution dis-
approving of the rescission rule and re-
instating the 2016 Obama-era methane 
standards is so important. 
Ambitiously addressing methane can 
yield 
tremendous 
climate, 
public 
health, and financial benefits across 
the country. It is why we see an out-
pouring of support from business and 
consumer groups, State and Tribal offi-
cials, local government officials, out-
door recreation and tourism leaders, 
environmental 
and 
conservation 
groups, and health and faith leaders. 
We even have significant support from 
within the oil and gas industry itself.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3140 
June 25, 2021 
So, today, we are using the Congres-
sional Review Act to soundly reject 
and nullify one of the most egregious 
environmental rollbacks of the Trump 
administration. 
With today’s vote, Congress stops the 
significant retreat we witnessed during 
the previous administration in the 
fight against climate change, and we 
reinstate an essential tool for address-
ing the harm a warming world means 
for our communities, our health, our 
economy, and the planet. 
With today’s vote, Congress restores 
the robust Clean Air Act pollution 
standards established in 2012 and 2016, 
while clearing a path for stronger pro-
tections in the future. 
With today’s vote, Mr. Speaker, Con-
gress recognizes the danger methane 
poses, as well as the economic oppor-
tunity and certainty created with com-
monsense and cost-effective limits on 
this pollution. 
Since the Senate already passed S.J. 
Res. 14 with a bipartisan vote of 52–42, 
it is now up to the House to do the 
same so we can send this resolution to 
the President’s desk. 
For the sake of our communities, our 
families, our country, and our future, I 
strongly urge all Members to join me 
in supporting this joint resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to this resolution of disapproval of 
the EPA’s methane policy rule. 
This resolution is another attack on 
the hardworking American men and 
women who supply energy that is so 
important to our economy and our na-
tional security. 
Don’t be mistaken, this is an attack 
on American energy security. 
Remember those gas lines from the 
1970s? Remember the energy security 
and dominance truly captured in the 
last few years? 
In 2020, America became energy inde-
pendent. It was a longtime goal. Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter established the De-
partment of Energy with a goal of be-
coming 
energy 
independent, 
recog-
nizing how important a diverse supply 
of energy is to America. 
So why is the majority moving for-
ward right now? 
Gas prices are already on the rise, 
threatening our economic recovery and 
causing pain at the pump for Ameri-
cans who are ready to put the pan-
demic behind them. 
We are still recovering from the Co-
lonial Pipeline cyberattack, which shut 
down the Nation’s most important 
pipeline, causing supply shortages and 
price spikes. 
If it is not already obvious to the 
Democrats across the aisle, affordable 
and reliable supplies of gasoline are ab-
solutely critical to our economy. It is 
critical to our way of life. 
This is a misguided resolution. Taken 
together with President Biden’s execu-
tive orders banning oil and natural gas 
drilling on Federal lands and canceling 
the Keystone XL pipeline, it will likely 
drive gas prices even higher. 
So why is the majority pushing this 
resolution? 
This resolution has next to nothing 
to do with protecting the environment 
or reducing methane emissions. The 
States and the EPA already regulate 
methane emissions, and we have a well- 
established program that supports the 
industry to go even further. 
Reducing methane emissions is a pri-
ority for all of us, for the oil and nat-
ural gas industry; and thanks to inno-
vation and industry action, the United 
States methane emissions rates in the 
largest producing regions have declined 
70 percent in the last decade, even as 
our production is surging. 
The United States is the world’s lead-
ing producers of oil and natural gas. 
That is something that we should be 
celebrating. That is so foundational to 
our economy, to our national security. 
In addition to that, we are leading 
the world in emission reductions at the 
same time. The United States of Amer-
ica has led the world in reducing car-
bon emissions, more than the next 12 
countries combined, more than any 
other country in the world. 
Again, that is something that we 
should be celebrating. Let’s not jeop-
ardize that progress to fulfill the Green 
New Deal wish list. 
We all know that this resolution is 
unnecessary. President Biden has made 
his intentions very clear. His adminis-
tration has declared war on affordable 
fossil energy and energy security. 
President Biden has already canceled 
the Keystone pipeline and banned drill-
ing on Federal lands. Now Democrats 
are proposing this resolution to clear 
the pathway for President Biden and 
the EPA to impose burdensome new 
regulations on the energy industry. 
This is just the tip of the iceberg to 
regulate other sources under section 
111 of the Clean Air Act, regardless of 
their overall contribution to air pollu-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I would submit we 
should be focusing on results, not on 
feel-good measures. This is an attack 
on American energy. 
Who is next? 
The EPA has its crosshairs on the 
backbone of American industry, includ-
ing manufacturing, paper, chemicals, 
plastics, and metals. Millions of good- 
paying American jobs are on the line. 
Our competitiveness is on the line. 
American leadership is on the line. Our 
national security is on the line. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this harmful reso-
lution, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Ms. 
DEGETTE), your neighbor and the prime 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, along 
with Mr. PETERS and Mr. LAMB, I am 
very proud to stand as the sponsor of 
the House companion of S.J. Res. 14, 
and I rise in strong support of the leg-
islation. 
The purpose of the legislation is very 
simple. It is to reduce our methane 
emissions and to help stave off the 
worst effects of the climate crisis be-
fore it is too late. 
Methane, as we all know, is one of 
the most potent greenhouse gases on 
the planet, and when it is released into 
our atmosphere, it becomes a leading 
contributor to global warming. 
Climate experts agree that one of the 
most important things we can do right 
now to combat the climate crisis is to 
reduce the amount of methane in our 
atmosphere, and that is exactly what 
this legislation does. 
It restores the 2016 methane emission 
rules that were put into place during 
the Obama administration, and it ne-
gates the Trump administration’s last- 
minute attempt to roll back these 
rules on its way out the door. 
One-third of all of the methane that 
is released in this country comes from 
the production of oil and gas. 
This legislation will, once again, re-
quire our oil and gas producers to take 
the steps needed to reduce the methane 
emitting from their drilling sites. 
These emissions don’t just harm our 
planet. When methane is released from 
oil and gas sites, it is often accom-
panied by other pollutants that are 
known to cause additional harm to 
people’s health. 
That is why this legislation is so im-
portant, and that is why the Trump ad-
ministration’s egregious attempt to 
eliminate these important rules and let 
oil and gas companies release more 
methane from their drilling sites was 
met with such outrage and fury by citi-
zens across this country. 
And you know something? 
And not just from the citizens, but 
from the biggest oil and gas companies 
in the country, including ExxonMobil, 
Shell, BP, and more, and also from 
smaller producers around the country. 
These are the companies that stand to 
benefit most from the rollback of the 
methane rules, and even these are 
against it. 
So when I hear the ranking member 
talking about how we are going to be 
on the backs of oil and gas companies, 
the very companies she is talking 
about support this legislation today. 
I just want to read a few of the 
names of the companies, large and 
small, that support the rollback of the 
Trump administration’s methane rule 
and the reinstatement of the Obama- 
era rule: 
BP America; Shell U.S.; Equinor 
North 
America; 
Total 
USA; 
ExxonMobil; Jonah Energy; Pioneer 
Natural Resources; EQT Corporation; 
Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America; 
Cheniere; 
DTE 
Energy; 
Equitrans Midstream Corporation; Oc-
cidental Petroleum; Devon Energy; 
Edison Electric Institute, which is a 
consortium of groups; Center for Lique-
fied

Gas;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3141 
June 25, 2021 
Calpine Corporation; Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company; Tenaska, Inc.; and 
others have all submitted comments, 
and the comments they have submitted 
are in support of S.J. Res. 14 and the 
rollback of the Trump administration’s 
egregious rule. 
So when my colleagues on the other 
side say this is going to hurt oil and 
gas, the very companies they are talk-
ing about support this because the 
Trump administration’s rule was so ex-
treme and egregious. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a summary of the quotes in support of 
this legislation from these companies, 
a letter from BP, a letter from Occi-
dental, and a letter from Equinor. 
ENERGY COMPANIES SUPPORT FEDERAL 
METHANE REGULATIONS 
Many oil and gas companies publicly sup-
port direct federal regulation of methane be-
cause methane pollution hurts public health, 
the planet, and the industry itself. These 
companies also support restoring the com-
mon-sense requirements to control methane 
pollution that were eliminated and under-
mined at the end of 2020. 
Methane regulations work to reduce meth-
ane emissions and waste from oil and gas op-
erations. To meet the requirements, compa-
nies use cost-effective tools and off-the-shelf 
technologies to find and plug methane leaks 
and reduce venting and flaring. But the pre-
vious administration revoked all federal air 
pollution limits for oil and gas transmission 
and storage facilities and created legal con-
fusion that undermines further progress in 
cutting methane pollution. Here’s what in-
dustry is saying about closing these loop-
holes and directly regulating methane: 
BP America: ‘‘Direct federal regulation of 
methane is key to preventing leaks through-
out industry and protecting the environ-
ment—and gets us closer to #netzero. That’s 
why we support the Congressional Review 
Act methane resolution.’’ 
Shell US: ‘‘Sound policy surrounding nat-
ural gas is critical to its role in the energy 
transition. We need to restore the direct fed-
eral regulation of #methane emissions—and 
we urge Congress to approve the methane 
resolution under the Congressional Review 
Act.’’ 
Equinor North America: ‘‘Ensuring that 
natural gas continues to provide climate 
benefits means reducing emissions from its 
production. We support the methane resolu-
tion under the Congressional Review Act. Di-
rect federal methane regulation is an impor-
tant step on the pathway to net zero.’’ 
Total USA: ‘‘Curbing methane emissions 
with bold policies is imperative to get to 
#NetZero2050. We welcome direct federal reg-
ulation of #methane emissions and support 
resolution via the Congressional Review Act 
#cutmethane.’’ 
ExxonMobil: ‘‘Last year we [ExxonMobil] 
announced our support for the direct regula-
tion of methane emissions for new and exist-
ing oil and gas facilities. That hasn’t 
changed.’’ 
Jonah Energy: ‘‘Jonah Energy believes in 
common sense federal regulation of methane 
emissions to reduce impacts and achieve cli-
mate goals. We support Congressional Re-
view Act measure S.J. Res. 14 (https:/lnkd.in/ 
ebHbACW) that will reverse prior rule-
making and allow reasonable federal over-
sight of methane. In fact, we opposed the 
rollback by the last administration. Achiev-
ing climate goals is important in our back-
yard, and across the nation. Reasonable fed-
eral regulations of methane emissions pro-
vide consistency and certainty covering all 
sectors of natural gas development and pro-
mote public confidence our national energy 
sources. 
Pioneer Natural Resources: Pioneer has 
long supported federal regulation of methane 
if those regulations encourage innovation 
and operational flexibility. Clear rules would 
provide certainty for operators and strong 
environmental benefits. We support use of 
the CRA to reinstate regulation of methane’’ 
EQT Corporation: EQT Corporation sup-
ports congressional resolutions that would 
reinstate a rule imposing a federal standard 
on methane. Company believes the ‘‘respon-
sible development of natural gas will help 
meet future global energy demand as we ad-
dress climate change together’’. 
Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America:- ‘‘We support federal methane 
standards . . . our members have a long his-
tory of minimizing methane emissions from 
their operation. A stable regulatory frame-
work will allow the industry to invest in the 
critical infrastructure necessary to reduce 
emissions and meet increasing demand for 
cleaner and more affordable energy. 
Cheniere: To maximize the climate bene-
fits of natural gas, we recognize the impera-
tive to minimize #methane emissions across 
the natural gas value chain. We support ef-
fective policies and regulations that reduce 
methane emissions, including the current 
Congressional Review Act effort to restore 
federal regulation of methane emissions. 
Cheniere will continue to collaborate with 
industry, academia and the scientific com-
munity to deliver cost-effective solutions 
that reduce methane emissions from the nat-
ural gas sector. We also will continue to 
push for increased transparency regarding 
methane emissions reporting and data, as 
well as efforts that create a level playing 
field with all operators domestically and 
internationally. 
DTE Energy: Strong, sensible methane reg-
ulations at the federal and state level give 
our industry the foundation on which to go 
even further through these voluntary initia-
tives. Providing a proper regulatory frame-
work ensures industry’s ability to continue 
to make important progress reducing meth-
ane emissions. [Public Comment 11/25/2019] 
Equitrans Midstream Corporation: ‘‘We 
must continue to push our industry forward 
in a meaningful way in order to effectuate 
real mitigation of climate change impacts, 
and we support approval of the methane res-
olution under the Congressional Review 
Act,’’ said Diana Charletta, president and 
chief operating officer of Equitrans Mid-
stream. 
Occidental Petroleum: ‘‘We support the di-
rect regulation of methane . . . because it is 
very potent and we need to have regulations 
in place to ensure that we have adequate 
controls throughout the industry.’’ 
Devon Energy: We believe a meaningful re-
duction in methane emissions is essential to 
managing the risks of climate change. While 
the Congressional Review Act is an extraor-
dinary legislative tool that should be used 
judiciously and with caution, we support the 
ongoing effort in Congress to chart a path 
toward a durable framework for regulating 
methane at the federal level that encourages 
innovation and operational flexibility. 
Edison Electric Institute: EEi supports 
Congress using the Congressional Review Act 
to enable EPA to develop strong and cost-ef-
fective federal regulations on methane emis-
sions throughout the natural gas supply 
chain for new and existing sources. 
Center for Liquified Natural Gas: The Cen-
ter for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG) and its 
members support the proposed resolution of 
disapproval under the Congressional Review 
Act (CRA) and the reinstatement of regula-
tions of methane emissions from the natural 
gas sector. 
Austin Energy, Calpine Corporation, Pa-
cific Gas and Electric Company, Tenaska 
Inc, and Others (Joint Comments): ‘‘EPA 
should continue to directly regulate meth-
ane from new sources in the oil and natural 
gas source category . . . the importance of 
controlling these emissions is clear when 
considering that the oil and natural gas 
source category is the largest source of an-
thropogenic methane emissions in the US, 
contributing 31 percent of US methane emis-
sions in 2017, according to EPA’s Inventory 
of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 
1990–2017 (published in 2019).’’

Washington, DC. 
Hon. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PALLONE
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER MCMORRIS RODGERS: bp’s ambition 
is to become a net zero company by 2050 or 
sooner and to help the world get there too. 
This includes advocating for policies that 
support net zero. 
bp supports the direct federal regulation of 
methane for new and existing sources across 
the value chain. Methane is a potent green-
house gas with a warming potential 80 times 
greater than carbon dioxide over the first 20 
years in the atmosphere. We believe regula-
tion is needed to ensure all companies are 
prioritizing methane emissions reductions. 
This is why bp supports the Congressional 
Review Act resolution on methane. 
We appreciate the leadership of Represent-
ative DeGette and others who recognize that 
regulating methane is good for the environ-
ment, business, and for US energy security. 
Further, we believe regulation can help pre-
serve the role for natural gas in a low carbon 
future. 
bp is in action to reduce methane emis-
sions from our operations. We aim for zero 
routine flaring in our US onshore operations 
by 2025 and have recently completed con-
struction of a $300 million electrified, central 
processing facility in the Permian Basin in 
Texas to enable emissions reductions. Addi-
tionally, we aim to install methane measure-
ment at all our existing major oil and gas 
processing sites by 2023, publish the data, 
and then drive a 50% reduction in the meth-
ane intensity of our operations. 
This is a critical decade for climate action. 
We appreciate the leadership of Representa-
tive DeGette and the work of this committee 
to advance this issue in Congress. 
I, or a member of my team, will be happy 
to meet with you or your staff to talk more 
about bp’s ambition and our efforts to mini-
mize methane. 
Sincerely, 
MARY STREETT, 
Senior Vice President, Americas, 
Communications & Advocacy. 
OCCIDANTAL, 
Houston, TX, June 10, 2021. 
MEMBERS
OF
THE ENERGY
AND COMMERCE 
COMMITTEE: Thank you for the opportunity 
to provide our views on H.J Res. 34. The de-
mand for energy and products that rely upon 
oil and natural gas will continue to rise glob-
ally, and we take seriously the charge to 
provide for those needs while approaching 
Net-Zero. Occidental was the first U.S. oil 
and gas company to establish comprehensive 
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goals, 
with a pathway to Net-Zero before 2040 for 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and an ambi-
tion to achieve Net-Zero for Scope 3 emis-
sions before 2050. Your efforts to evaluate 
and advance legislation to address climate 
change are critical to helping companies like 
Occidental achieve these objectives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3142 
June 25, 2021 
Occidental supports the data-driven, direct 
regulation of methane which is why we sup-
port H.J. Res 34. Earlier this year, President 
Biden directed EPA to draft new methane 
regulations 
for 
both 
new 
and 
existing 
sources and we are working with the Admin-
istration on those efforts. This legislation 
will clarify EPA’s authority to regulate 
methane and allow EPA additional flexi-
bility to write a thorough rule. Because it 
has access to the most comprehensive emis-
sions data via GHG reporting program and 
other means, we strongly believe that EPA 
should lead the effort to regulate methane. 
In their rulemaking process, EPA should 
work with external stakeholders to craft 
public policy that achieves methane emis-
sions reductions, incentivizes early action, 
and supports flexibility and innovation. We 
look forward to sharing data and best prac-
tice information about our operations with 
EPA to assist in the creation of strong and 
effective regulations. 
Occidental 
thanks 
Representatives 
DeGette, Lamb, and Peters for their leader-
ship on this important legislation and we 
look forward to additional opportunities to 
collaborate on ways to approach Net-Zero. 
Sincerely, 
VICKI HOLLUB, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, 
Occidental.

Hon. TOM CARPER, 
Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment 
and Public Works, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, House Committee on Energy and

Hon. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy 
and Commerce, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN CARPER, RANKING MEMBER 
CAPITO, CHAIRMAN
PALLONE, AND
RANKING 
MEMBER RODGERS: Equinor US encourages 
members of both the Senate and House to 
support a proposed resolution of disapproval, 
under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), 
to rescind the recent rule ‘‘Oil and Natural 
Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Re-
constructed, and Modified Sources Review’’ 
and largely reinstate the Obama-era regula-
tions of methane emissions from the oil and 
gas sector. 
In 2019, we submitted comments to the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) op-
posing the then proposed rule and outlined 
our view that regulation of methane is a nec-
essary part of a comprehensive, economy- 
wide policy program to address global cli-
mate change. 
In those comments, Equinor US noted that 
‘‘it is important to have a federal regulatory 
‘floor’ that provides a consistent, flexible, 
predictable, 
and 
comprehensive 
policy 
framework for the sector.’’ We stand by this 
policy approach and believe that a return to 
the 2012 and 2016 standards, until a more 
workable regulation or pieces of legislation, 
considering modern technological develop-
ments, can be passed and/or implemented. 
Equinor US appreciates the strong leader-
ship of many in Congress who recognize the 
role of responsibly-produced natural gas in 
the energy transition and we believe that the 
deployment of the Congressional Review Act 
to undo the 2020 rule is appropriate and in 
line with our own net-zero ambitions. 
Sincerely, 
CHRIS L. GOLDEN, 
Senior Vice President, Global 
Unconventionals, Equinor US.

I will just say that if we don’t act 
now and if we let this rule stand, it is 
going to increase methane emissions in 
this country by nearly 1.6 tons by 2025. 
It will also result in a release of an ad-
ditional 1.8 million tons of volatile or-
ganic compounds and more than 16,000 
tons of hazardous air pollutants right 
into the air that we breathe. 
If we are going to get serious about 
addressing the climate crisis, let’s get 
serious about cutting our methane 
emissions. If we are going to get seri-
ous 
about 
protecting 
the 
public’s 
health, let’s pass this legislation today. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this important bill that has widespread 
support, not just from environmental-
ists, not just from the public, but from 
the oil industry itself. 
Let’s do what the people have elected 
us to do. Let’s put their health and 
safety, and the health and safety of our 
planet, above all else. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on S.J. Res. 14. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
S.J. Res. 14, which would increase the 
cost of energy for consumers and result 
in the loss of good-paying American 
jobs in our energy and manufacturing 
sectors. 
My district in northwest and west- 
central Ohio is home to over 60,000 
manufacturing jobs, with thousands 
more to come with recent announce-
ments made in the past few weeks. One 
of the key factors that businesses con-
sider when they make decisions about 
expanding or relocating is their ability 
to keep energy costs down while still 
being able to maintain profitable oper-
ations. 
Because of the American energy ren-
aissance, fueled by lower domestic oil 
and natural gas production costs and 
the Trump administration’s common-
sense regulatory approach, we have 
seen more companies come to or return 
to the United States and bring with 
them high-paying, quality jobs to our 
communities. 
My fear is that by returning to the 
Obama EPA standards, we will be re-
asserting an outdated and burdensome 
regulatory regime that will sacrifice 
all the gains we have made in building 
up America’s manufacturing sector. 
If the argument is about addressing 
climate change, then we really need to 
acknowledge the fact that the United 
States has been a global leader in emis-
sions reduction since 2005. Since that 
time, emissions have fallen by more 
than 20 percent on a per capita basis. 
We should be focusing on innovative 
solutions and not accelerating the pro-
mulgation of cumbersome or duplica-
tive regulations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose S.J. Res. 14, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PETERS), a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee and 
a strong environmentalist. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. I am here to 
speak in favor of S.J. Res. 14, a resolu-
tion I co-led with Representatives 
DEGETTE and LAMB. 
We need to address methane emis-
sions for several reasons, and today, I 
want to mention three. 
First, controlling methane is the sin-
gle most important immediate step we 
can take to combat climate change, 
and that is because methane is a super- 
pollutant responsible for about 25 per-
cent of the man-made warming we ex-
perience today. This is the low-hanging 
fruit in climate mitigation. 
My Republican colleagues never miss 
a chance—and you will hear this 
today—to point out that the natural 
gas revolution has contributed to our 
historic energy independence and cut 
our carbon dioxide emissions from en-
ergy production. That is right, but 
there is still a problem, and that prob-
lem is fugitive methane emissions. 
While burning natural gas can lower 
CO2 emissions by as much as 40 to 50 
percent versus burning coal, almost all 
of that benefit, from a climate change 
perspective, is wiped out even with 
small leaks of methane, which we have 
today. Put simply, to reap the climate 
benefits of natural gas, which are often 
touted, we have to address methane 
emissions. 
Second, controlling methane is crit-
ical to the economic competitiveness 
of the U.S. natural gas industry. We 
should say thanks to the oil and gas in-
dustry when they do the right thing, 
but let’s not fool ourselves by thinking 
that they are doing this because they 
are altruists. They are doing this be-
cause this is important to competitive-
ness. They are doing this because this 
makes American oil and gas more com-
petitive. The reason is that world mar-
kets and domestic politics will not tol-
erate natural gas as a so-called bridge 
fuel unless the industry can prove, 
with real credibility and transparency, 
that it has fixed its methane problem. 
It is increasingly apparent that the 
viability of exporting U.S. liquefied 
natural gas, or LNG, depends on Amer-
ican policies to address methane pollu-
tion. 
Three of the largest LNG importers 
in the world, South Korea, Japan, and 
the European Union, have set goals to 
reduce emissions to net-zero by mid- 
century. These nations will demand 
verifiably clean gas from the United 
States. 
On top of this, investors are increas-
ingly putting pressure on financial in-
stitutions 
and 
demanding 
climate- 
smart investment portfolios. Natural 
gas will solely be seen as a climate risk 
and not as a climate opportunity if 
methane leaks persist. 
We saw this recently in the cancella-
tion by France of a deal for liquefied 
natural gas from Brownsville, $7 billion 
over 20 years. Ultimately, they were 
able to put that back together, but this 
is a sign of what is to come. If we don’t 
get it right here, it is going to hurt 
business.

H3143 
June 25, 2021 
They all sounded like businesses to 
me, what Ms. DEGETTE talked about. I 
am not from Texas or Oklahoma, but I 
have heard of Exxon, and I have heard 
of the American Petroleum Institute. 
If they are for it, it says something 
about where business is, what they 
think about competitiveness. 
Third, U.S. companies can lead the 
world in developing technologies to 
monitor and reduce methane emis-
sions. Dealing with climate change is a 
science project. It is not a jobs pro-
gram, but it does create a lot of jobs. 
Seventy-five percent of the manufac-
turing firms and 88 percent of service 
firms in the sector report that they 
would create more jobs if the national 
methane standards were reinstated. 
And the starting salary for methane 
mitigation jobs is nearly 10 percent 
higher than the national average sal-
ary and can pay up to $140,000 a year. 
These companies represent the best 
of American innovation, creating eco-
nomic opportunity and tackling global 
challenges at the same time. 
Today, we in Congress can soundly 
reject one of the most irresponsible en-
vironmental rollbacks of the prior ad-
ministration. We can restore robust 
methane pollution standards, and we 
can clear a path for stronger protec-
tions in the future. 
I am proud to be a co-lead on this 
resolution. I encourage my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ This is a win-win-win for 
climate, public health, and U.S. indus-
try. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JOHNSON), my colleague. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to this harm-
ful methane resolution. It is just an-
other example of this majority’s and 
this 
administration’s 
ever-changing 
‘‘support our global competitors at the 
expense of America’s workers’’ energy 
narrative. 
They say they don’t want to ban hy-
draulic 
fracturing, 
interfere 
with 
American energy dominance, or in-
crease supply chain dependence on 
China, but with their renewed Obama- 
era regulations, the cancellation of 
America’s pipeline projects, and pro-
posed bans on domestic plastics manu-
facturing, it is clear they have an ulte-
rior energy plan that might as well 
have been written in Moscow or Bei-
jing. And the American taxpayer is 
footing the bill. 
As oil and gas prices rise with our 
country reopening from the pandemic, 
there should be an increase in new 
wells being drilled and rigs being 
brought online to meet demand, but re-
ports suggest this is not the case. 
Under pressure from radical environ-
mentalists, coupled with the risks of 
an uncertain regulatory environment, 
American oil and gas producers are re-
ducing drilling investments, costing 
jobs, and increasing the likelihood of 
continued price spikes at the pump and 
at the grocery store. 
While Democrats continue their as-
sault on America’s hard-earned global 
energy 
dominance, 
our 
adversaries 
have positioned themselves to take ad-
vantage of America’s absence at the 
leadership table while also making a 
profit. 
In just the latest example, President 
Biden lifted sanctions on the comple-
tion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, 
Putin’s pipeline, which will be oper-
ational soon, sending Russian gas to 
Europe and billions into Putin’s pock-
et. 
While he lifts sanctions on the Rus-
sians here at home, the President is, in 
effect, imposing sanctions on Amer-
ica’s energy workers, all without Rus-
sia or China having to lift a finger. 
America’s energy security—in effect, 
our national security—cannot depend 
on President Biden’s weak leadership 
any longer. 
Mr. Speaker, you can just add this 
methane resolution to the long list of 
President Biden’s predictably terrible 
policy solutions. Not only are we bet-
ter than this, but we are smarter than 
this. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
measure. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, this CRA 
is another act by the Biden administra-
tion to undercut American energy pro-
duction. It is plain and simple. 
In committee, I offered an amend-
ment to this resolution that would 
simply express Congress’ disapproval 
for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which 
would bring Russian gas to Europe. 
Now, for the entire Trump adminis-
tration, Democrats were obsessed with 
imagined Russian influence over his 
policies, repeatedly calling him a Rus-
sian agent. If Trump had waived sanc-
tions on a Russian company and a 
friend of Vladimir Putin, like Presi-
dent Biden just did, there would be an 
immediate call for an investigation. 
You guys would probably try to im-
peach him again. 
President Biden just killed the Key-
stone pipeline and continues to ham-
string domestic producers, particularly 
smaller producers, killing American 
jobs and American energy production. 
It is truly baffling and illogical to me 
that he is willing to greenlight Russian 
energy projects while he kills Amer-
ican projects and kills American jobs. 
You know, the irony is that these en-
ergy-destroying policies actually have 
a negative impact on the environment. 
Think about this: Russian natural gas 
exported to Europe has a lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions profile that 
is 41 percent higher than American 
LNG exported to Europe. If Europe 
were to switch from dirtier Russian gas 
to 
clean-burning 
U.S. 
natural 
gas 
through LNG exports, global emissions 
would actually go down by 70 million 
tons each year. 
The United States is the number one 
oil and gas producer in the world, but 
we also lead the world in emissions re-
duction, something you all don’t want 
to acknowledge. 
Putin would love nothing more than 
for America to be energy dependent, 
and President Biden is helping him 
achieve this goal. And Vladimir Putin 
is laughing. 
I urge my colleagues to defend Amer-
ican 
energy 
production 
and 
vote 
against this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. LAMB), one of the chief 
sponsors of this legislation. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of this bill. 
I would like to point out to my col-
leagues and anyone watching at home 
that I actually think that, today, the 
difference is not really between busi-
ness and labor; it is not between regu-
lation and nonregulation; it is really 
not even between Democrats and Re-
publicans. I think what separates sup-
porters of today’s bill from its detrac-
tors are those who are thinking in the 
long term versus those who are think-
ing in the short term. 
In the long term, climate change 
truly is a threat to American national 
security. The Marine Corps, in which I 
served, has already had to consider 
whether it should move some of its his-
toric bases, including Parris Island, 
perhaps the soul of the Marine Corps, 
simply due to sea level rise. 
The number of $1 billion catastrophic 
events in our country last year was 22. 
The average is seven over the last 40- 
year period. 
This is getting more expensive and 
more dangerous every year. In the long 
term, businesses that have to compete 
for capital and compete for market 
share in markets all around the world 
understand this, that this is our world 
now, that decarbonization is an abso-
lute requirement to compete success-
fully both as the United States and as 
an individual business in the world 
that we are going into. 
The businesses that are thinking 
long term have already taken steps to 
do this, and the businesses that are 
thinking short term are pointing to the 
costs, the drawbacks, and the require-
ments, all of which are real. 
None of us stand here today to caus-
ally make anything more difficult on 
an American company that is trying to 
preserve jobs and succeed in this econ-
omy, but there are some things we just 
have to do. 
To use the words of an executive at 
Southwestern Energy Company: 
What some in the industry do not get is 
that we are transitioning to a low-carbon 
economy. We need to show the climate ben-
efit of our product. 
Or, you could take the word of the 
chairwoman and president of BP Amer-
ica: ‘‘We have to reduce methane emis-
sions for natural gas to realize its full 
potential.’’

And in my own hometown of Pitts-
burgh, 
we 
are 
happy 
to 
have 
headquartered the largest producer of 
natural gas in the United States, EQT. 
And even though under the Trump ad-
ministration the EPA came to Pitts-
burgh to announce this absurd rollback 
of a rule that’s good for business and 
good for the environment, EQT’s presi-
dent and CEO just 2 days ago said that 
tackling methane represents an oppor-
tunity for the United States because 
our natural gas, American natural gas, 
can become the decarbonizing com-
modity of choice. 
So I have heard some of my friends 
on the other side point out, that, yes, 
the United States has done quite a lot 
already to reduce emissions and is 
doing more, and not all our competi-
tors, like Russia and China, are doing 
the same. 
That is okay. Our market oppor-
tunity will come from attracting busi-
nesses among our allies, South Korea, 
Japan, the European Union. And if you 
just picture now a politics of the near 
future where the European Union is 
placing carbon tariffs on every product 
that comes in and out, lower carbon, 
American L&G will simply out-com-
pete Russian products, or Iranian prod-
ucts, or any other product. That is the 
world that we live in now and that is 
what it will mean for us to compete. 
Today’s bill is about one thing and 
one thing only: the national interest of 
the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this resolution. 
America’s oil and gas industry is 
truly the backbone of the American 
economy, supporting 10 million jobs 
and contributing to billions of dollars 
of economic development in all 50 
States. 
The energy industry is critical to our 
economic and national security, pro-
viding low and stable energy prices to 
American families and ensuring our 
independence from the Middle East and 
Russia. 
Despite these essential contributions, 
Democrats here are attempting to 
strap the industry with duplicative and 
unnecessary regulations. This resolu-
tion will contribute to American job 
losses and higher energy costs for 
American consumers, right on their en-
ergy bills. 
This will also not reduce worldwide 
emissions, and the reason is because 
China is building coal-fired power 
plants at a rate that outpaces the rest 
of the world combined. 
So what we are doing here with not 
only this resolution, but the other poli-
cies that my friends on the other side 
of the aisle are pushing, is we are actu-
ally hurting America, losing American 
jobs, giving up our energy independ-
ence so we are reliant on China and 
Russia and the Middle East. 
Why in the world would we do that? 
Mr. LAMB said this is for America. I to-
tally disagree. This will hurt America 
and this bill will help China and Rus-
sia. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining on 
each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 131⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Ohio has 181⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. PENCE). 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to implore this governing body to con-
sider the consequences of using the 
Congressional Review Act as a vehicle 
to reinstate the harmful Obama-era 
regulations on methane emissions. 
American energy independence is key 
to the economic and national security 
of Hoosiers and, of course, of all Ameri-
cans. 
These unnecessary and redundant 
regulations on new methane emissions 
will stifle responsible energy develop-
ment and undercut our domestic en-
ergy potential. Because of the addi-
tional Federal regulations this would 
create, Hoosiers will pay more to heat 
their homes and to cook their meals, 
which we are already seeing right now. 
As a veteran of the petroleum indus-
try, I know that free market innova-
tion has always been the key driver to 
developing more cost-effective and en-
vironmentally friendly uses of natural 
gas. Let’s keep doing that. 
The burdensome regulations like the 
one before us today have never been 
the answer to improve our environ-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I came to Washington 
to protect Hoosiers’ way of life back 
home in the Sixth District, and that is 
why I will continue to advocate for an 
all-of-the-above, 
not 
everything-but 
approach to energy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this attempt to cripple Amer-
ican energy. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes now to the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ), 
who also represents one of my favorite 
places, Santa Fe. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I do welcome everybody in 
this Chamber to New Mexico, which is 
indeed one of the beautiful places that 
I get to call home. But you know what, 
New Mexico, my beautiful place I call 
home is also ground zero for the cli-
mate crisis. 
The West is experiencing a dev-
astating drought, coupled with dam-
aging wildfires, and these are caused, 
undoubtedly, by the climate crisis we 
are experiencing. My beautiful State is 
also home to both the Permian and the 
San Juan Basins. And because of that, 
we also have some of the highest levels 
of methane pollution. We also have 
some of the highest levels of asthma 
rates among our beautiful children. 
And every bit of methane that is re-
leased is wasted. It is wasted. It is a 
valuable resource that is released into 
the air by methane venting, through 
flaring, and simply because they have 
not maintained their sites. 
But methane that is released and 
flared and leaked is also a resource 
upon which my State cannot collect 
severance taxes, upon which my State 
cannot collect royalties. And so when 
that methane is leaked and flared and 
vented, those same children who are 
suffering from those high asthma rates, 
they lose the resources that should go 
into our public education. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say that my 
State—which needs every little nickel 
and dime, because we are a poor State, 
and which relies on those oil and gas 
revenues—what did we do? We recently 
enacted some of our own rules to curb 
methane emissions from oil and gas ac-
tivity, and these rules are now consid-
ered to be the best in the country. 
If New Mexico can lead the way, we 
can follow it here in Congress, because 
taking action at the Federal level is 
reasonable, it is common sense. 
As Don Schreiber, one of my con-
stituents and a rancher in New Mexico 
who has those issues on his site says, 
‘‘New Mexicans built our oil and gas in-
frastructure, and these same commu-
nities can now design, manufacture, 
and install the technology to monitor 
and prevent methane emissions.’’ 
Because you know what? Regulation 
spurs innovation, and we are looking 
forward to that innovation and those 
good jobs that will come from the 
methane regulation that we will have 
now when we overturn this rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
Senator HEINRICH, for introducing and 
advancing this legislation in the Sen-
ate, and my great colleagues here, Rep-
resentatives DEGETTE, LAMB, and PAL-
LONE for advancing and championing 
the cause of my wonderful children and 
students and State here on this rule. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this partisan resolution 
is unnecessary for a number of reasons. 
At its core, this is a solution that is 
looking for a problem. 
The oil industry already is volun-
tarily reducing methane emissions and 
the United States has led the world in 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 
the last two decades. Innovation is the 
ultimate answer to cutting emissions. 
We cannot afford to stifle advance-
ment. 
As a Nation, we cannot regulate our 
way to a cleaner environment. Most 
importantly, new methane regulations 
are duplicative of existing Federal and

State regulations under the Clean Air 
Act for volatile organic compounds 
known as VOCs. 
The EPA determined in an earlier 
rulemaking that ‘‘rescinding the meth-
ane limits will not actually change the 
amount of methane emissions reduc-
tions.’’ 
This resolution is not about methane 
emissions or climate change. The truth 
is that we already regulate methane. 
The EPA and the States have strong 
standards in place for volatile organic 
compounds and methane. 
The existing standards and the pollu-
tion control equipment installed at oil 
and gas facilities help to manage both 
methane and VOCs because they are 
both produced from the same source 
and have a similar chemistry and be-
havior. 
The real intent of this misguided res-
olution is simple—the oil and gas sec-
tor is just the tip of the iceberg—the 
purpose is to give the EPA authority to 
use Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to 
regulate every other sector of our econ-
omy. 
Congress must continue to embrace 
the bottom-up innovation that will re-
sult in leaps in efficiency far greater 
than any mandate, instead of expensive 
overregulation that will take money 
out of working Americans’ pockets. 
As a Nation, we can do better. As a 
Congress, we must do better. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting ‘‘no’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, you 
can put American behind Equinor. It 
doesn’t make it an American company. 
It is a Norwegian company that used to 
be called Statoil; now it is called 
Equinor that has American operations. 
You can put American behind Shell. 
It doesn’t make it an American com-
pany. It is a Dutch company who has 
its own legal problems in its own court 
that has American operations. I appre-
ciate both of them. 
At times they have done business in 
North Dakota; they have been great 
corporate citizens. You can talk about 
Exxon and you can talk about BP; you 
can talk about Shell. But let’s be care-
ful when we talk about all companies 
big and small that support this indus-
try, because the one caveat with all of 
these companies—and this is true—the 
vast majority of their production does 
not occur onshore and most often does 
not even occur in the United States. 
And so what does that mean? They 
are not subject to this CRA. 
Small and medium-sized gas compa-
nies do not support this regulation. 
North Dakota oil and gas companies do 
not support this regulation. And it is 
not because they are interested in pol-
luting. It is because they don’t want to 
be duplicatively regulated from the 
wellhead to the market. 
States are already doing this. We 
have heard this from New Mexico. 
North Dakota is regulating this. We 
have our industrial cushion; we have 
our DEQ. 
But the real problem with this EPA 
regulation and these Obama-era poli-
cies coming back is not only its dupli-
cative regulation, but it actually sti-
fles innovation; because the one thing 
State regulators can do significantly 
better than the Federal Government is 
respond quickly—adapt. So when an in-
dustry comes to you and says, Hey, I 
have a way to do this better, they will 
work with you, they will get it done. 
We see it happen every day in the Oil 
Patch in western North Dakota. 
The problem is Federal regulation at 
its very core is unwieldy, it is burden-
some, and it gives a tremendous mar-
ket share advantage to large compa-
nies over smaller companies. 
We need to stop duplicative regula-
tion. We need to allow industries to 
regulate and States to innovate and 
regulate. And we know this because we 
have heard it a lot. If the market is de-
manding, companies are going to do it. 
Why do we need the burdensome Fed-
eral regulation? 
b 1000 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
PETERS). 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to respond to a couple things I 
heard. 
One is this tip of the iceberg idea 
that we are doing something beyond 
methane by doing this. Of course, that 
is not how it works around here. The 
laws are specifically written around 
what we are doing. We are only voting 
on this. I can tell you that if we were 
doing more than this, we might get a 
different response from the oil and gas 
industry than we have seen. That is not 
a real argument. 
The other thing is that this is some-
how cooked up by the Biden adminis-
tration as a way to undercut oil and 
gas. Again, I want to go through all of 
the names that Ms. DEGETTE
went 
through of the companies and organiza-
tions that support this regulation, but 
it is hard to argue that the American 
Petroleum Institute is anything other 
than American. 
It is also hard to argue, even with a 
company that is based someplace else, 
that they would be arguing to burden, 
as it is characterized, their United 
States operations with these regula-
tions. There would be no incentive for 
them to do that, no matter where the 
corporate headquarters is based. 
The fact is that these companies see 
this as a way to be competitive, and it 
is not unprecedented. One thing we did 
on the committee last term that be-
came part of the year-end spending 
plan was the American Innovation and 
Manufacturers Act, which regulated 
HFCs. If you recall, the industry sup-
ported the institution of standards 
around HFCs so that it could compete 
successfully 
with 
manufacturers 
around the world that are building 
from the same standards. 
It was actually helpful for them to 
have a uniform standard that they 
could innovate around, and that is why 
Republicans and Democrats supported 
that and it became part of a bipartisan 
end-of-year package. We are in the 
same situation here where businesses 
are saying, set a standard here. 
Don’t tell us that we are going to get 
one set of regulations, by the way, in 
Colorado, and virtually no regulations 
in Texas. We are not being duplicative 
at all. What we are doing is setting a 
standard. Let’s set a Federal standard. 
Let’s do it at the request of the indus-
try and with the cooperation of the in-
dustry to make sure we get it right. 
And I guess the other remarkable 
thing that is implied by all of this dis-
cussion is that we are talking about 
regulating methane out of oil and gas 
production. No one is talking about 
banning oil and gas. We wouldn’t have 
to be talking about methane at all if 
we were talking about that. In fact, we 
are trying to take oil and gas and get 
it right, to get it competitive, and get 
it to be climate-friendly for our future 
generations. 
So I thought that the one glaring 
omission from my colleagues’ argu-
ments is: How do you explain so much 
support from American oil and gas 
companies for this regulation? 
I wouldn’t suggest that it is unani-
mous. I would say probably it is not. 
But to dismiss it is really, I think, 
missing the point. And I think it is ob-
vious that this industry sees this as an 
advantage in terms of competitiveness 
going forward, as Mr. LAMB said as 
well. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to this Con-
gressional 
Review 
Act 
resolution, 
which would nullify a rule put in place 
by President Trump that contributed 
to 
our 
American 
energy 
domestic 
dominance. 
Unfortunately, for Democrats, this 
misguided solution in search of a non-
existent problem trades American live-
lihoods for radical activist priorities. 
The United States leads the world in 
emissions reductions, thanks to the 
natural gas revolution. Our emissions 
declined significantly over the last few 
decades, while natural gas production 
spiked by more than 50 percent, prov-
ing that renewable resources like nat-
ural gas provide a clean, low-cost en-
ergy alternative. 
This CRA will only limit our domes-
tic supply and force us to look abroad, 
once again, empowering OPEC and 
Russia to determine the price of living 
our daily lives. As the ranking member 
of the Energy and Minerals Resources 
Subcommittee, I know that our domes-
tic energy producers are the best in the 
world.

June 25, 2021 
With many being small business own-
ers, they are a testament to American 
innovation as they deliver us low-cost 
energy while reducing emissions. We 
need to return to American energy 
first policies that empower our workers 
and American innovation, and not 
failed policies that hand the keys over 
to our rivals. 
Mr. Speaker, therefore, I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this resolution. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
also in strong opposition to this resolu-
tion, as it is yet another attempt by 
my Democratic colleagues to nickel 
and dime the most essential industry 
in my district out of business. 
The energy policies of the Biden ad-
ministration have been a complete and 
utter disaster. American jobs are being 
lost and gas prices are soaring due to a 
retreat from the policies of the Trump 
administration that created American 
energy dominance. 
Small and midsize oil and gas pro-
ducers employ tens of thousands of 
New Mexicans and contribute millions 
of dollars in revenues to my State’s 
budget. These essential businesses are 
the ones that will be most negatively 
impacted by the passage of this resolu-
tion. 
Small and midsize producers are al-
ready under attack by the ban on new 
oil and gas leases on Federal lands put 
in place by this administration, which 
a Federal judge ruled to be illegal just 
last week. 
Instead of approving foreign pipelines 
and 
implementing 
duplicative 
and 
costly regulations, which strengthen 
the hands of our enemies, this adminis-
tration and this House should be fo-
cused on creating jobs here at home 
and lowering energy costs for all Amer-
icans. 
I, and many other of my Republican 
colleagues, have put forward common-
sense pieces of legislation to ensure 
economic and environmental sustain-
ability for our constituents. This legis-
lation does just the opposite. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
oppose this legislation and to join us 
on this side of the aisle in fighting to 
continue the American energy domi-
nance agenda of the previous adminis-
tration that resulted in a cleaner envi-
ronment and a vibrant economy. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I would also like to bring to 
this body’s attention that this resolu-
tion will actually put New Mexico on 
the same playing field as the rest of 
the country because, as I noted earlier, 
New Mexico has now adopted some of 
the strictest methane regulations in 
the country. 
And those regulations, similar to 
what we are seeing now, were adopted 
in consultation and with the support of 
many in the oil and gas industry who 
participated in the rulemaking, who 
recognize that it is in their best inter-
est to operate in a manner that is safe, 
in a manner that does not lose this pre-
cious resource. That is how we came to 
our regulations in New Mexico. 
But we are at a disadvantage in New 
Mexico because, as it was noted earlier, 
if some States have nice, good regula-
tions with regard to methane emissions 
and others don’t, then in the Permian 
Basin, for example, what would stop a 
company from saying: I am going to 
drill in Texas and not in New Mexico 
because they are protecting our envi-
ronment in New Mexico? 
So what I look forward to seeing is 
having New Mexico be at the same 
place as the rest of the country, so that 
we are not losing our drilling to Texas, 
who doesn’t have it. Mr. Speaker, I like 
the idea of everybody has the same set 
of rules. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I op-
pose this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is in a long 
line of attacks from a hostile adminis-
tration, and some of my Democratic 
colleagues, against oil and gas, conven-
tional fuels, which has blessed our 
country with a safe, affordable abun-
dant supply of energy. It fuels our 
economy. It keeps energy costs low for 
consumers and working families. It 
gives us energy independence. 
In addition to the Paris climate and 
millions of jobs going away in the fu-
ture as we implement that, pipeline 
and 
critical 
infrastructure 
cancelations, public land drilling mora-
toriums, weaponizing the tax code—be-
cause that is what is next—as they do 
away with ordinary and necessary de-
preciation and general business ex-
penses, the posture from my colleagues 
is hostility toward an industry that 
has been so good to this country and to 
working families. 
In this case, we would go back to the 
Obama-era regulatory regime that is 
costly and burdensome, not to the mul-
tinational oil and gas companies. They 
welcome it because they will just in-
crease their market share. It is the 
mom and pop, small business, inde-
pendent producers who make up 85 per-
cent of the production of oil and gas. 
They can’t take this. They will shut 
their doors. We will shutter family- 
owned small businesses. 
And for what? 
Trace amounts of methane gas. The 
cost benefit does not make any sense. 
This is a sledgehammer-to-a-fly ap-
proach. The real emitters on methane 
gas, if that is your goal, downstream, 
large-scale 
industrial 
utilities, 
and 
other industrial operations, that is 
where we ought to focus. That is what 
the Trump administration focused on, 
gave room for innovation, respected 
State regulation, and that partnership 
and Federalism. 
Mr. Speaker, that is my position. I 
implore my colleagues to join me in 
opposing this and get back to some rea-
sonable approaches to stewarding our 
environment and economic growth. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, can I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-
ing on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 6 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania has 7 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
vehemently opposed to the Democrats’ 
latest move in their war on American 
energy independence. 
Today’s misguided resolution calling 
for additional onerous regulations from 
the Obama administration era to be re-
imposed on the fossil fuel industry will 
only lead to a lack of energy security. 
Just 2 years ago, the United States 
became the number one producer of oil 
and natural gas in the world, thanks to 
President Trump’s administration’s de-
regulation that allowed private energy 
innovators and entrepreneurs to flour-
ish. 
I represent the Permian Basin, and 
let me just state for the record that 
Texas does have methane regulations, 
a completely false accusation that I 
have heard three times in this debate. 
Energy security is national security. 
And now we risk losing our competi-
tive edge on the world stage with need-
less regulations that will hurt small 
and independent producers and crush 
innovation; the same private innova-
tion that has allowed the United States 
to lead the way in reducing methane 
emissions to a 20-year low. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation relies on af-
fordable, reliable energy; the same af-
fordable, 
reliable 
energy 
that 
has 
raised a billion people out of poverty in 
the last 10 years—a billion people out 
of poverty. 
Today, global demand is going to 
continue to increase. We cannot allow 
foreign adversaries, like China and 
Russia and others, to profit off of our 
overly regulated State. Let me say 
again, energy security is national secu-
rity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this resolution and 
standing up for American energy inde-
pendence.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close if the gentleman is. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is just the tip of 
the iceberg. EPA will use the resolu-
tion to clear the way for other sources 
without formally establishing that a

June 25, 2021 
pollutant significantly contributes to 
harmful air pollution as a predicate for 
new regulations. Manufacturing, paper, 
plastics, metals, and virtually every 
other industry in America certainly 
could be next. 
We must not allow overregulation to 
crush the energy jobs that America 
wants and America needs. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is quickly becoming 
clear that the greatest potential to 
curb 
methane, 
and 
thus 
climate 
change, in the next decade is in the fos-
sil fuel sector. 
The U.N. Environment Program and 
the Climate and Clean Air Coalition 
published the ‘‘Global Methane Assess-
ment’’ just last month, and they found 
that fast and ambitious methane miti-
gation is one of the best strategies 
available today to deliver immediate 
and long-lasting benefits for climate, 
agriculture, human, and ecosystem 
health. 
They also found that rapid and dra-
matic methane pollution cuts could 
both slow global warming and prevent 
a quarter-million deaths every year. 
Also, reduction measures used to 
curb methane from the oil and gas sec-
tor would also cost the least or, in 
some cases, even have negative costs, 
as captured methane can be resold for 
revenue in the oil and gas sector. 
These relatively inexpensive meth-
ane reduction methods are possible 
with currently available technology, 
like fixing leaks in gas pipelines and 
stopping venting in gas drilling. 
These findings support what many al-
ready know to be true, that ambi-
tiously addressing methane pollution 
can yield tremendous climate, public 
health, and financial—and I stress ‘‘and 
financial’’—benefits across the econ-
omy. This is why we see most of the oil 
and gas companies supporting this res-
olution. 
Disapproving a rule that would lead 
to an increase in methane pollution, 
and reinstating the 2016 rule’s com-
monsense 
and 
cost-effective 
safe-
guards, should be an easy ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
For that reason, I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support 
this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to oppose 
S.J. Res. 14, the Methane rule Congressional 
Review Act repeal. The Democrat majority and 
the Administration are not passing this legisla-
tion for climate change, they are passing it to 
support big oil and foreign petrol dictators. 
We are in a weird place in this Nation when 
the action of hurting American energy devel-
opment in favor of foreign development is 
celebrated by the majority, but that is where 
we are today. While my Majority colleagues 
are celebrating this as a massive win, the re-
ality is the only people winning from this action 
are people who don’t need wins, and the los-
ers are the American people. 
By repealing this common sense balanced 
rule, this Congress will now put the agencies 
in a place with fewer tools, fewer options, and 
on a path for a rule which will directly harm 
most of our nation’s oil and gas producers, 
while leaving the world’s worst actors free to 
continue polluting the globe. America’s oil in-
dustry isn’t made up of supermajor oil players, 
much of America’s oil comes from small and 
mid-sized producers. The rules proposed by 
the Obama Administration would have deci-
mated that sector of the oil and gas industry 
with burdensome costs and massive paper-
work requirements, all for a fractional impact 
on methane emissions. The rule drafted by the 
Trump Administration recognized this and 
would have protected all industry while at the 
same time working to lower our national meth-
ane emissions. However, as a result of this 
action today the Democrat Majority is deciding 
that they want to side against small busi-
nesses and join the side of Big Oil pushing 
costly, burdensome, and ineffective methane 
regulations on all American producers. The re-
sult will be an oil and gas industry dominated 
by bigger and bigger oil companies using their 
size and buying ability to squeeze out small 
producers. 
But Big Oil isn’t the only winner Democrats 
are picking today. Foreign petrol dictators are 
winners as well. Not a single foreign producer 
is obligated to meet our methane rules for 
their production. So while the result of this bill 
will be to squeeze small oil and gas producers 
in Bakersfield and Kern, California, the foreign, 
Russian and Saudi imports that make up a 
majority of the California oil consumption will 
be untouched. There isn’t a single Aramco, 
Saudi, oil well in the world that will comply 
with the methane rule that will be produced as 
a result of this action today. But there will be 
millions and billions of barrels of Saudi oil con-
sumed in California over the next decades. 
Again, don’t let the majority fool you today, 
this action isn’t about reducing methane emis-
sions or impacting climate change, this action 
is about Big Government supporting Big Oil 
and giving foreign petrol dictatorships an ad-
vantage over American producers. That is why 
I am voting no on this bill and urge all my col-
leagues to do the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous 
question is ordered on the joint resolu-
tion. 
The question is on the third reading 
of the joint resolution. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on passage of the joint reso-
lution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring of the 
House majority whip the floor schedule 
for next week. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLY-
BURN) my friend, the House majority 
whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman allowing me 
to stand in for the majority leader. I 
know he joins me in hoping that the 
majority leader will be back with us 
very shortly and that this will be his 
last time having to contend with me. I 
hope that Mr. HOYER will be rejoining 
us very soon, as he continues to mend. 
Next week, the House will meet on 
Monday at 12 p.m. for morning-hour de-
bate and at 2 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness, with votes expected no earlier 
than 6:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday, the House will meet at 
10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 
p.m. for legislative business. 
On Wednesday, the House will meet 
at 12 p.m. for legislative business. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for legislative business. 
On Friday, the House will meet at 
11:30 for a pro forma session. 
On Monday, we will consider several 
bills under suspension of the rules. The 
complete list of suspension bills will be 
announced by the close of business 
today. 
In addition, we will consider: 
H.R. 3005, legislation to remove the 
bust of former Chief Justice Roger 
Brooke Taney, Confederate statues, 
and certain other statues. 
H.R. 2662, the Inspectors General 
Independence and Empowerment Act. 
This legislation is sorely needed in the 
wake of the prior administration’s as-
sault on the rule of law and inde-
pendent oversight. It would strengthen 
the independence of inspectors general 
and protect their ability to investigate 
abuses at Federal agencies. 
A resolution to establish a select 
committee to investigate the January 
6 attack on the Capitol. 
H.R. 3684 will be considered, the IN-
VEST in America Act, to grow our 
economy and create good jobs by mod-
ernizing our Nation’s roads, bridges, 
rail, and transit. In addition to ad-
dressing surface transportation, this 
bill will also include critical provisions 
to address our safe drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure needs. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, as we 
look at some of the bills that are going 
to be coming to the floor next week, I 
know there has been a lot of talk about 
infrastructure. 
As we saw over these past few days, 
there is a bipartisan bill that is being 
worked through mostly in the Senate, 
where a number of Republicans and 
Democrats had seemed to reach an 
agreement on what would be consid-
ered traditional infrastructure without 
tax increases. It has now become a lit-
tle more confused by a suggestion that 
maybe the Speaker has said it has to 
be tied to a budget reconciliation bill 
that would possibly raise taxes, which 
is surely not where we are. It doesn’t 
seem to be where the bipartisan group 
in the Senate is. 
I would ask the gentleman: Is there 
any 
expectation—because 
we 
don’t 
have a budget that has moved through 
the House, and a budget would have to 
move first to create the ability for a 
budget reconciliation bill to move 
through the House or the Senate, if 
that even happened. 
Is there expectation there would be a 
budget resolution coming to the floor 
in the upcoming weeks? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
b 1100 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I have not consulted with the major-
ity leader on that subject. I suspect 
that we will wait for the Senate’s ac-
tions and make determinations as 
needed when we get some definition as 
to what they are going to do. 
I understand that the gentleman in-
dicates that what has occurred regard-
ing the bipartisan legislation is of con-
cern, but I assure the gentleman that 
the President made it very clear from 
the beginning that he has a definition 
of infrastructure that goes into family 
needs that are more or less nontradi-
tional, and I think that all that the 
Speaker has been talking about is to 
reinforce her beliefs that the President 
is correct in his thoughts. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, for 
decades, we have never really had a dis-
agreement 
on 
what 
infrastructure 
means. I think most Americans would 
recognize the definition that we have 
always gone by on a bipartisan basis, 
and it is roads and bridges, waterways 
and ports. 
I think, recently, both sides would 
agree that broadband is something that 
we would include in that definition, 
but that is what always was the tradi-
tional definition of infrastructure by 
both parties. 
It seems like on the majority side 
they are trying to change that defini-
tion to include a lot of extraneous 
things of which were not part of the 
Senate bipartisan agreement. But the 
other new addition seems to be this 
idea that a bill, a shell reconciliation 
bill to raise taxes, would now be some-
thing that would maybe hold hostage 
the rest of the bipartisan agreement. 
I hope that is not the road we go 
down, especially considering there does

June 25, 2021 
seem to be a lot of bipartisan move-
ment on something that we would all 
agree is traditional infrastructure. 
I know the bill next week that is 
being brought to the House floor does 
not meet that bipartisan test of what 
Senators and others who are trying to 
work together have reached agreement 
on. So, hopefully, this doesn’t get 
bogged down in a fight on things that 
are not considered infrastructure. 
I don’t know if the gentleman has 
anything to add to it. I would hope we 
would go down the road where both 
parties could come to an agreement 
and we could actually get something 
done. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I don’t know that I have any more to 
add to that except to say that, if we go 
back into history, we have got to know 
that rail was not infrastructure until 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
decided 
that 
it 
should be. Interstate highways were 
not infrastructure until Dwight Eisen-
hower decided that they should be. And 
broadband was not infrastructure until 
now. I think that is because we are 
being more futuristic when we think 
about what the needs are going to be in 
this great country as we move forward. 
I am glad that the gentleman agrees 
that broadband is, in fact, an infra-
structure issue. A couple years ago, I 
had a very hard time getting people to 
understand that. COVID–19 has re-
vealed to us that there are things that 
we did not consider in the past which 
we 
must 
consider 
going 
forward. 
Broadband is one of them. Family in-
frastructure needs or a few other 
things. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate that. I hope as we look toward 
something that we could all agree on, 
that that is the road we stay on, so to 
speak, as we talk about infrastructure, 
not extraneous things that we don’t 
agree on. 
Clearly, we have looked at and 
agreed on things like broadband, and 
we have seen the FCC take good steps 
to continue to expand broadband, espe-
cially in rural areas where there is a 
true digital divide that we are trying 
to overcome. 
I know Congress has come together 
many times in the last few years to try 
to put more money in place to bridge 
that gap on the digital divide. There is 
still more work to do. Especially dur-
ing the pandemic, we saw there are 
more needs. But if we could keep it fo-
cused on those things, I think you will 
see a lot of bipartisan agreement. Once 
it gets beyond that, that is where 
things break down. 
What I want to ask about, something 
that is going to expire at the end of 
next week, and that is this proxy vot-
ing scheme that has been going on 
since May of last year. 
From what the majority had pre-
sented when this got created was the 
reason that proxy voting was there is 
because we had a pandemic and things 
were shut down, and people had trouble 
getting around and maybe were con-
cerned about the virus and not wanting 
to leave maybe their home or their 
local community. 
Obviously now, with a vaccine read-
ily available for any American who 
wants to take it, with more States 
opening up, and you are seeing even 
here in Congress many committees 
that were not having in-person hear-
ings are now getting back to in-person 
hearings. 
So what I would ask the gentleman 
is: When proxy voting expires on July 
3, can we let Congress get back to the 
normal work and not renew proxy vot-
ing? 
Because, as we have seen, there is a 
lot more cooperation, a lot more agree-
ment you can reach when you are here 
in person working together that you 
just can’t get on a Zoom or Webex call 
or just somebody staying at home 
proxy voting and not coming here to 
Washington when now everyone, who 
wants to, can come. 
We have looked at what this has 
done. It has hurt the institution, in our 
opinion. But there are six Democrats 
who, since this got started last year, 
have never come to vote in person ex-
cept for the vote for Speaker of the 
House because that is a vote that you 
cannot cast by proxy. So if they were 
able to get here for the vote for Speak-
er in January, yet on every other vote 
have not cast a single vote in person, 
then it is clear it is not because they 
have no ability to get to Washington. 
It feels like there is an abuse of this 
proxy voting that has shown it needs to 
end. I don’t know if there is an expec-
tation next week that the majority 
would renew this. We would urge 
strongly that we let it expire on July 3, 
and then get back to the work that we 
do in person. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I assure the gentleman that his con-
cerns are well considered on this side of 
the aisle. Next week will be our last 
week before going into the Independ-
ence Day break, and I suspect some as-
sessments will be made between now 
and our returning after the July 4 holi-
day. 
As you know, we have gone from 45 
minutes down to 20 minutes. Now I am 
looking forward to us going to the reg-
ular 15 minutes now that people are 
gathering on the floor. 
We want to be a family-friendly Con-
gress. Families are reordering their 
businesses so that their children and 
other children can be accounted and 
taken care of as we return back to nor-
mal. These considerations are not just 
for us, but they are for what is hap-
pening 
back 
in 
communities 
and 
whether or not these communities are 
being stood up in such a way that 
childcare can be available and other 
things that will keep families intact. 
But I assure you that we are con-
cerned about getting back to regular 
order, and I look for that to occur 
hopefully soon after the July 4 holiday. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate that. Hopefully, we just let it 
expire. Clearly, that is our hope. We 
urge the majority to consider that be-
cause, if you look at voting, it is good 
that we are finally limiting the time so 
we can have a normal voting schedule 
or at least get closer to that. 
As we look at the appropriations 
process, for example, where appropria-
tions bills will start moving out of 
committee in July, may start coming 
to the floor in July, as we know, if we 
have a robust, open process for appro-
priations bills, typically you might 
have 100 amendments on a given appro-
priations bill, and so many times we 
have late-night votes. We have 2- 
minute votes because, if Congress is 
truly going to process those amend-
ments in an orderly way, even 15- 
minute votes or 5-minute votes haven’t 
worked. So we went to a 2-minute vot-
ing schedule. 
You can’t do that if we have proxy 
voting 
because, 
as 
the 
gentleman 
knows, it does eat up a lot more time 
and delays our ability to move through 
a normal appropriations process. 
So looking toward that, the July 3 
date is there. If it expires, as we hope 
it does, I think that would help Con-
gress to more effectively work through 
some of the big bills that we have on 
our calendar ahead. I know you all will 
be considering that. I think the gen-
tleman knows where we are and what 
we would hope happens. 
I do want to ask about some of the 
crises that we are seeing around the 
country. You look at inflation con-
tinuing to be a growing problem. We 
had in our committee the Federal Re-
serve Chairman Powell just a few days 
ago, who talked about the concerns 
with 5 percent inflation we continue to 
see. 
Whether it is gasoline prices, double- 
digit increases, everything we buy at 
the grocery, you are starting to see 
larger increases in costs for grocery 
items. Housing, if you are just trying 
to buy a house, to renovate your house, 
those costs are higher. If you want an 
appliance, you might have to wait for 6 
months. 
Much of that is because of the labor 
shortage. Every small business you 
talk to says the biggest impediment 
they have to getting their businesses 
back up again is that the Federal Gov-
ernment is paying people more money 
not to work than to go back to work. 
When you have millions of job open-
ings, it doesn’t seem to make sense 
that we are allowing people to be paid 
not to work when businesses are trying 
and struggling to get back on their feet 
from this pandemic. 
I don’t know if there is an anticipa-
tion to bring legislation to start con-
fronting some of those problems. 
Clearly, we see the Vice President at 
the border today. While she is not at

the areas of the border where you see 
the biggest increases in illegal cross-
ings, we know that there is a crisis in 
the United States. And it is not just 
people in South and Central America 
coming across. We are seeing people 
from Middle Eastern countries. There 
have been people on the terrorist watch 
list who are coming. I hope that as she 
comes back from that trip—hopefully 
she has met with Border Patrol agents. 
People have told us what the prob-
lems are. The President could address 
all of this today by reversing some of 
his executive actions that have opened 
the border. But if he doesn’t, I hope 
Congress would look at bringing legis-
lation to confront a lot of those chal-
lenges that I talked about. 
I am not sure if you all anticipate 
bringing bills like that, but I would ask 
the gentleman if he had any comment 
on that. 
Madam Speaker, I would be happy to 
yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
As you mention, we were on it this 
week with the presence of Chairman 
Powell at our select subcommittee 
hearing. Chairman Powell made two 
things very clear to us. 
Number one, he says it would be a big 
mistake to put the brakes on too soon; 
that we must allow families to get 
back on their feet, communities to get 
restored. And he advised against us 
doing anything too soon. 
He also made it very clear that if he 
and the Fed were to make some deter-
mination that inflation is becoming a 
problem, the Fed could deal with it. 
You may recall that he indicated 
that a lot of the price increases have 
come about as a result of bottlenecks 
that have existed in the system as peo-
ple are gearing back up, and he thinks 
that is going to be temporary. He also 
feels that if it looks like this is going 
to go beyond being temporary, that he 
has the tools to make the kind of ad-
justments that are at least necessary 
to keep the economy flowing and to 
keep inflation in check. 
I think that on my side of the aisle, 
we are very comfortable following the 
advice of Chairman Powell, and I would 
hope that this is an issue that will not 
get politicized. We need to get this 
country back on track. We need to get 
families back in touch with each other. 
We need to keep this country moving 
in a positive way. So I think we are 
going to wait and take advice from 
Chairman Powell on whether we should 
do anything legislatively to deal with 
that issue. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
As we know, the Federal Reserve 
Chairman has some tools available to 
him, if need be, to address problems in 
the economy that we are starting to 
see, but we also know that those tools 
are very harsh. Hopefully, those tools 
would be a last resort. 
So it is important for us, as policy-
makers, to not just sit back and wait 
for problems to occur that then the 
Federal Reserve Chairman has to ad-
dress because we haven’t. Because we 
know if he does those things, whether 
it is limiting money supply, interest 
rate increases, those are all things that 
would hurt hardworking families all 
across the country. 
So as he even recognized, right now 
the enhanced unemployment benefits 
that are, by all accounts, the reason 
that we are having a worker shortage, 
the reason that every small business is 
having trouble getting more people 
back to work so they can meet that 
supply demand that is starting to cre-
ate inflation, he did acknowledge that 
when those enhanced benefits run out, 
then you will see the worker shortage 
get better and improve and people start 
going back to work. 
We could end those earlier, acknowl-
edging there are millions of job open-
ings. We shouldn’t be paying people 
money to not work when there are jobs 
that are available right now and they 
can’t find takers. 
What we have seen is a majority of 
States now have said: We are going to 
end those benefits on our own so that 
people can get back to work, so that we 
can get our economies moving. 
Many large States—Florida, Texas, 
Tennessee, and many other States—by 
the end of next week will do that. 
I am proud that yesterday in my 
State, our Governor, who is a Demo-
crat, signed a bill working with Repub-
licans to end our enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits in Louisiana by the end 
of July. 
b 1115 
He acknowledged, as a Democrat, 
that you can work together, and that 
this is a problem, so let’s address this 
problem. While States are addressing 
it, some are not. Many have. 
But, hopefully, Congress can look at 
ways where we can address some of 
these problems earlier so that it 
doesn’t fall in the lap of the Federal 
Reserve Chairman, and then he has to 
take harsh steps to deal with the prob-
lems that we should be fixing as we see 
them coming. 
I yield to the gentleman if he has 
anything else. That is all I have. 
Mr. CLYBURN. I assure you that, in 
my instance, my Governor is a Repub-
lican. In fact, he was the first Governor 
to endorse the previous President. But 
we are very close friends, and we have 
been in consultation over what to do as 
we go forward. 
I am working very closely with him 
and working very closely with other 
Governors, as well. I think that each 
State is unique when it comes to how 
to stand back up as we go forward. 
I am proud that Louisiana is moving 
in the right direction. I applaud John 
Bel Edwards for working closely with 
you. I assure you that I am working 
just as close with the Governor of 
South Carolina and other Governors to 
make sure we do what is necessary to 
apply our efforts in such a way that it 
won’t cause problems for States as 
they stand back up. 
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate that be-
cause I work well with our Governor. 
We might not see eye to eye on every-
thing, but Governor John Bel Edwards 
is 
addressing 
those 
problems 
ade-
quately. He worked with the Repub-
lican legislature. They got an agree-
ment, and it was a good agreement. 
I know you have a good relationship 
with your Governor. You and I have a 
good relationship. Hopefully, we can 
use those good relationships to prove 
people wrong who look at Congress and 
say: Why can’t they get agreements on 
things? 
Again, we are seeing some positive 
movement on the Senate side. I haven’t 
seen the details, and the details are 
very, very important. But, hopefully, 
on these big issues, we can work to-
gether and build those relationships so 
that we can actually solve these prob-
lems and solve them in a way that 
doesn’t harm families, where it could 
end up in a harsh place if we don’t con-
front those problems. I know we will be 
talking more about that in the future. 
If the gentleman is not the one doing 
the colloquy in the future—we hope the 
majority leader is back—I have en-
joyed this colloquy with you. We, obvi-
ously, enjoy our relationship on many 
fronts, but it has been a pleasure to 
work with you on the colloquy. 
Hopefully, the majority leader is here 
next time, and he has big shoes to fill. 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. I thank the gen-
tleman for his friendship and kind re-
marks today. But I am looking forward 
to the majority leader coming back 
and taking his rightful place at this 
mike. The gentleman and I can con-
tinue our relationship with the Select 
Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Cri-
sis and in other areas around the Cap-
itol. 
Mr. SCALISE. He will probably be 
moving around even faster. I will not 
challenge him to a race. I am not quite 
where he is yet, but I am working to 
get there. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

permission to address the House for 1

Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, nearly 
40 percent of Americans before COVID 
couldn’t cover an unexpected $400 ex-
pense without selling belongings or 
going into debt. And no one pays a 
greater price for poverty than our kids. 
I am proud of our work to pass the 
American Rescue Plan and deliver a 
lifeline 
for 
millions 
of 
struggling 
Americans. Starting July 15, that life-
line gets stronger.

month throughout 2021, hardworking 
families will get a check of up to $400

per child. That check will help millions 
of parents buy healthy food, new 
clothes, shoes, and books for their kids, 
pay rent and utilities, and even afford 
childcare so they can get back to work. 
In my own home district in New 
York’s capital region, these checks will 
reach more than 37,000 households and 
help lift more than 5,000 of our kids out 
of poverty. These are not just lasting 
investments in America’s recovery; 
they are the downpayment on our 
brightest future. 
I urge every parent and family that 
has struggled to make ends meet dur-
ing 
this 
pandemic 
to 
visit 
childtaxcredit.gov and make certain 
that you are signed up. 
f 
PRICE OF INFLATION PAID BY 
MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, despite 
our Nation sitting on the edge of a fis-
cal cliff, the Biden administration con-
tinues to propose trillions upon tril-
lions of dollars in new taxpayer spend-
ing. 
Sadly, yet not unexpectedly, the 
American people are beginning to see 
the consequences of taking their hard- 
earned tax dollars for continued and 
unprecedented levels of deficit spend-
ing. 
The Consumer Price Index has in-
creased 5 percent from this time last 
year, which marks the fastest rate of 
inflation since right before the eco-
nomic crisis in 2008 and a nearly 13- 
year high. This is in addition to pro-
ducer prices rising 6.6 percent over the 
past year, the fastest increase on 
record. 
I don’t care what the reasons are; I 
know that Americans are feeling it 
right now in their pocketbooks. Rising 
inflation at this rate is the same thing 
as a tax, and American consumers are 
feeling it as they shop for the essen-
tials. 
Gasoline is 56 percent more expensive 
today than it was 12 months ago. 
Transportation services are up 11 per-
cent since last year. Together, food and 
energy prices have increased 3.8 per-
cent, which is the fastest rate since 
1992. 
Middle-class families are paying the 
price for the lack of fiscal responsi-
bility shown by this administration. 
It is time to get our fiscal house in 
order to ensure our children and our 
children’s children are left a thriving 
economy. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, for 
decades, the Hyde amendment has 
shielded the American taxpayer from 
being forced to fund abortion. And for 
decades, the Hyde amendment has en-
joyed broad bipartisan support. Even 
President Biden supported the Hyde 
amendment as recently as 2019. 
Unfortunately, that is no longer the 
case. Now, President Biden has re-
versed course, proposing we repeal the 
Hyde amendment. 
In turn, this would require American 
taxpayers, no matter what their per-
sonal beliefs, to fund abortion. 
Madam Speaker, this is wrong. Every 
life is blessed with inherent worth, infi-
nite potential, and sacred dignity. 
As a child of adoption myself, I would 
not be here today if not for my moth-
er’s decision to choose life over abor-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to stand strong 
in support of the Hyde amendment and 
against this radical new position of 
President Biden. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BUSH). Under guidelines consistently 
issued by successive Speakers, as re-
corded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, as a 
father of four, I believe that life is a 
gift that must be cherished and de-
fended. 
For me, a pro-life father of four, a 
huge part of my story is my son Isaac. 
Isaac was born with Down syndrome. I 
know that with our love and support, 
he is capable of moving mountains. 
The sad news is that many don’t be-
lieve that people like my son deserve a 
right to life or to reach their full po-
tential. 
This is why I am a cosponsor of legis-
lation like H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding for Abortion Act. This bill 
will help ensure that taxpayer dollars 
do not go toward taking away any 
child’s right to life. 
Imagine a world where every child 
was given the opportunity to dream, 
accomplish, and succeed. The world 
would be a much better place, our fu-
ture brighter than ever. 
That is why I will always support 
legislation that ensures every life is 
protected. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, the request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
HAVE CBO ISSUE INFLATION 
PROJECTIONS 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, the 
American people deserve to know the 
true cost of government spending. 
Last month, working families ad-
justed their budgets around a 5 percent 
jump in prices, an effect of the $1.9 tril-
lion American Rescue Plan that many 
economists predicted would occur. 
Despite 
these 
predictions 
coming 
true, 
many 
Democrats—not 
all, 
I 
hope—are eager to use the same par-
tisan 
budget 
reconciliation 
process 
again to spend even more. 
That is why I have introduced the 
Stop Inflationary Spending Act to re-
quire the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office to project the infla-
tionary impact of reconciliation bills. 
This would mean the American people 
would know the impact on their family 
budget before Democrats use a partisan 
process 
to 
spend 
$6 
trillion 
on 
unaffordable initiatives that dramati-
cally increase the role of government 
in their lives and constrain growth in 
the real economy, which is the private- 
sector innovators, entrepreneurs, and 
hardworking people. 
Madam Speaker, inflation is a tax on 
everyone. When inflation was a signifi-
cant concern in the 1980s, CBO issued 
inflationary projections for individual 
bills. Restoring this practice for rec-
onciliation bills that spend big is a 
commonsense reform.

Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise

to 
recognize 
Chief 
Michael 
Nesslage, who has served as fire chief 
in Hiawatha, Iowa, for the last 16 
years. I want to congratulate him on 
his well-deserved retirement this week. 
Chief Nesslage dedicated his profes-
sional life to protecting and serving 
others. As Hiawatha’s fire chief, Chief 
Nesslage successfully started ambu-
lance service in the area and spear-
headed the creation of a volunteer fire-
fighter program. Not only did Chief 
Nesslage help establish the program, 
but 
he 
also 
closely 
coached 
and 
mentored those seeking careers as first 
responders. 
Chief Nesslage continues to be a role 
model for our entire community.

Madam 
Speaker, ‘‘Our Nation honors her sons

defend a country they never knew and 
a people they never met.’’ This is the 
quote you will find at our Korean War 
Veterans 
Memorial

Washington,

Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the 
71st anniversary of the Korean war, to 
honor the more than 5.7 million Ameri-

lion Korean war veterans alive today, 
and to remember the more than 36,000 
Americans and 1 million South Korean 
civilians and soldiers who gave their 
lives to protect freedom. 
As an immigrant from South Korea 
whose family lived through the Korean 
war, and as a wife and sister of vet-
erans, I know that I am here because of 
the sacrifices of our brave Korean war 
veterans. 
This is personal to me. Words alone 
cannot express how grateful I am. 
Freedom is not free, and each of you 
stands as a reminder of our Nation’s 
commitment to freedom and to the 
safety and security of our allies in 
South Korea.

EROSION IN ORANGE COUNTY

Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise

tremely important for my Orange 
County community. 
This week, my district braced for ex-
treme high tides that presented an-
other flood risk to Newport Beach. City 
workers raised sand berms on the Bal-
boa Peninsula and handed out sandbags 
to residents, hoping to avoid another 
flood like the one we experienced last 
July. 
One Newport Beach resident this 
week said, ‘‘I have lived here for 10 
years. I have never seen the bay so 
high or the ocean so high this early 
and before high tide.’’ This risk of flood 
in our communities is real. 
This 
week, 
Lieutenant 
General 
Spellmon from the Army Corps said 
that erosion in our community was not 
unique. I agree that this is an issue all 
around California, but the difference is 
Orange County’s problem was brought 
on by the Federal, man-made projects 
that permanently stopped natural sand 
flow onto our beaches. 
The Army Corps created this issue, 
and it is their job to ensure the final 
stages of sand replenishment are made 
a priority. The safety of our commu-
nities is at risk, and we are one natural 
disaster away from devastating dam-
age. 
Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work 
with local stakeholders to call on the 
Army Corps to fix the problem they 
made. 
f 
IN THE LINE OF DUTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today not to 
speak of persons who die unjustly at 
the hands of the constabulary, I rise 
today to speak of members of the con-
stabulary who die unjustly at the 
hands of persons who are among what 
we call ‘‘the public.’’ 
I rise today to accentuate five words: 
‘‘In the line of duty.’’ 
These words may be meaningless to 
some, but there are those who have suf-
fered the pain of having to live with 
these words for the rest of their lives 
after having lost someone that they 
love in the line of duty. 
Emily Dickinson, the great American 
poet, reminds us that, ‘‘A word is dead 
when it is said, some say. I say it just 
begins to live that day.’’ These words 
take on meaning for those who are left 
behind when someone leaves in the line 
of duty. 
I am standing here today in the 
House to make an appeal to those who 
have thoughts of doing dastardly deeds 
simply because a person happens to be 
a part of the constabulary. 
I would beg that you not consider 
these thoughts, that you abandon 
them. And I would beg that if you have 
the opportunity to go to one of the 
homegoing ceremonies of a person who 
has left in the line of duty—I have been 
to these ceremonies. I have seen the 
suffering of the families, the tears. I 
have seen the children who will no 
longer have a parent to go home to. 
All life is precious. I have spoken 
many times about the lives that have 
been lost at the hands of the constabu-
lary, but we should never forget that 
all lives are precious. 
And when someone takes the life of a 
member of the constabulary out of 
spite, for no cause that can be justified, 
that person, of course, has to be pros-
ecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
But that doesn’t end the suffering, just 
as it doesn’t end the suffering for the 
civilian who loses his or her life. It 
doesn’t end the suffering and the pain. 
We ought not allow ourselves to be-
come so removed from the lives of oth-
ers that we cease to have some degree 
of sympathy and empathy for persons 
who lose their lives in the line of duty. 
If a person finds some degree of com-
fort in knowing that a person lost life 
in the line of duty, then you must be a 
sadist. It is a sadistic thing to conclude 
that a life lost in the line of duty is 
something that you can take some de-
gree of pleasure with. You need help. 
And I am saying these words today. I 
am calling this to the attention of peo-
ple that I don’t know, but I know what 
my staff has reported to me, about per-
sons who lost their lives in the line of 
duty, and how this number is ticking 
up, and how many of these lives were 
lost senselessly. 
Madam Speaker, we must respect all 
life. I believe that we have a responsi-
bility to those that we will never meet 
and greet, to say to the world that we 
disapprove of this senseless taking of 
life as it relates to those in the con-
stabulary. And I am talking about 
those who are just sitting in a car and 
someone comes along and takes a life 
of a person serving in the line of duty. 
My uncle was a deputy sheriff. I had 
great respect for him. I conclude that I 
am who I am today because of words 
that my uncle said. My uncle and I 
were in his police vehicle, and I was 
asking a lot of questions. And my un-
cle’s words were, ‘‘This boy is asking a 
lot of questions. I think he is going to 
be a lawyer.’’ I didn’t know what a law-
yer was, but I respected my uncle’s 
words. And because I had such respect 
for him at a very young age—I was less 
than 10 years of age—I concluded that 
I shall be a lawyer—perhaps not in 
those words—but I concluded that I 
would be a lawyer. 
So all of my life from that point for-
ward was dedicated to becoming a law-
yer because my uncle, the deputy sher-
iff—well-respected—proclaimed that I 
would be a lawyer. I thank God that he 
didn’t say, ‘‘You know, this boy is ask-
ing a lot of questions. I don’t think he 
is going to amount to anything. He 
doesn’t know anything.’’ 
A word is not dead when it is said. I 
remember when my uncle died, deputy 
sheriff, well-respected. I didn’t make it 
to his funeral. I was in the sky over 
Louisiana on a plane trying to get 
there, and we were forced out of the 
sky by an act of God. Destined to stay 
overnight in Lafayette, I missed his fu-
neral, and I missed him. 
Madam Speaker, I want people to 
know that we who seek justice for 
those who have been treated unjustly, 
we don’t do it out of some desire to see 
justice for one. I do it because I desire 
to seek justice for all. I know what ‘‘in 
the line of duty’’ means to people, and 
I know what my uncle meant to me. 
Madam Speaker, today, I tell my 
dear friends, I stand here in the House

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3153 
June 25, 2021 
of Representatives proud to be a part of 
this great country, but with this very 
simple message: I beg, let’s show re-
spect and pray that we will receive re-
spect for those who serve and those 
who put their lives on the line such 
that some of them will suffer to have 
the words ‘‘in the line of duty’’ recalled 
as they make their transition, as their 
homegoing ceremonies are commemo-
rated. 
I truly believe that this country 
needs to reconcile. We need reconcili-
ation. There are just too many things 
happening now that are signs of this 
need of reconciliation that we have not 
had the opportunity to perfect. And I 
have suggested to the President that 
he establish a Department of Rec-
onciliation with a Secretary of Rec-
onciliation. Just as we have a Depart-
ment of Labor and a Secretary of 
Labor, to deal with labor issues, we 
need someone to deal with the need for 
our country to reconcile our dif-
ferences. 
I am not justifying anything that has 
happened because of past occurrences 
with reference to ‘‘in the line of duty.’’ 
I am merely saying that there are so 
many of these ugly things happening 
that we ought to find reason to put in 
place a means by which we can have a 
discussion about them and properly 
educate people about all of the things 
that can make a difference in our lives 
as we try to adjust our lives for the 
things that have happened in the past. 
The past does impact the present as 
well as the future, and it is time for us 
to reconcile, Mr. President. 
So Madam Speaker, I beg of Mr. 
President to give consideration to the 
establishment of a Department of Rec-
onciliation. You would place on our 
agenda, long after you depart from the 
Presidency, the continuation of the 
need to bring this country closer to-
gether, to help us to understand each 
other better, to move forward with a 
greater desire and love for each other. 
I pray that we will do this, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
And finally, I pray that I will never 
have to attend another in-the-line-of- 
duty ceremony. These things are re-
lated in this sense. There are people 
who believe that somehow the suffering 
that others have caused that have been 
inflicted upon people, somehow they 
are justified by taking the life of a per-
son they do not know. I hope that we 
can prevent this from happening ever 
again. I know that it has happened, but 
I don’t want to see it happen again. 
And I believe that we need to start this 
process of reconciliation. It will make 
a difference. 
And I pray that we will never again 
have to go to these ceremonies where 
we all leave saddened by the loss of 
someone who was but only doing his or 
her job. 
We need to resolve our differences in 
this country. There is no justification 
for what is happening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
ADJOURNMENT

ant to section 11(b) of House Resolu-

TONY BEEF 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize two brothers, Nick 
and Anthony Della Vecchia, and the restaurant 
they built from the ground up, Tony Beef. 
Since Nick and Anthony were kids, they had 
the dream to open up a restaurant. This 
dream was started from their father, Tony, 
who always dreamt of opening up a butcher 
shop. Nick graduated from La Salle University 
majoring in accounting and finance and now 
manages Tony Beef. Anthony is a graduate of 
Atlantic Cape Community College Academy of 
Culinary Arts and is Tony Beef’s head chef. 
Nick and Anthony’s family have been sup-
portive of their dreams from the beginning and 
have been by their side every step of the way. 
Because their father was a huge inspiration for 
them to open their own restaurant, they de-
cided to name it Tony Beef in honor of him. 
I had the opportunity to eat lunch at Tony Beef 
and meet Nick and Anthony, and I encourage 
anyone in the South Jersey area to stop by 
and grab a burger. God Bless Nick and An-
thony and God Bless America.

RECOGNIZING DR. RANGA DIAS 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ranga Dias, for his discovery 
of the world’s first high-temperature super-con-
ducting material, carbonaceous sulfur hydride. 
Because of their potential to change the world 
as we know it, such materials have been 
sought by scientists for more than a century. 
I couldn’t be more proud that this discovery by 
Dr. Dias, and his collaborators, was made in 
my district. I also want to acknowledge the in-
credible support from the National Science 
Foundation and Department of Energy Office 
of Science that made this work possible. 
Dr. Dias is a professor of Mechanical Engi-
neering and Physics and Astronomy at the 
University of Rochester and an internationally 
recognized scientist in the field of high-pres-
sure physics and high energy density science. 
Since announcing his discovery this past Oc-
tober, Dr. Dias’ work has been extensively re-
ported in popular press, including the New 
York Times, NPR, and the BBC. Dr. Dias was 
named to the 2021 Time 100 NEXT list that 
highlights 100 emerging leaders who are 
shaping the future and was recently awarded 
a National Science Foundation Faculty Early 
Career Development, or CAREER, award. CA-
REER is the NSF’s most prestigious award in 
support of early-career faculty and is intended 
to help them build a firm foundation for a life-
time of leadership in integrating education and 
research. 
Professor Dias’ research focuses on mate-
rials under extreme pressures where their 
properties are altered in fundamental ways. At 
these incredibly high pressures, individual 
atoms are forced into close proximity, in a 
similar manner as when they are cooled to 
very low temperatures, allowing them to ex-
hibit a range of interesting quantum behaviors, 
including super-conductivity. This approach is 
a paradigm shift that has allowed Dr. Dias’ 
team what no one else has. To say this is the 
stuff of science fiction would be an understate-
ment. 
To create this material, the team placed a 
mixture of carbon, hydrogen and sulfur in a 
microscopic niche carved between the tips of 
two diamonds and then subjected them to 
laser light and squeezed them at 2.6 million 
times atmospheric pressure at sea level. The 
result was a new record: a material that exhib-
ited superconductivity at about 58 degrees 
Fahrenheit. The hope, which I share, is that 
with further research, this team of talented sci-
entists will find a way to make these, or similar 
materials, stable at ambient temperatures and 
pressures, unlocking a wide range of potential 
applications that will literally transform our 
world, including ultra-efficient computers and 
electronic devices, essentially loss-less energy 
transmission and storage, and new forms of 
propulsion and industrial power transmission 
without friction. With this approach, it may 
even become possible to create unique mate-
rials whose properties are tuned to particular 
applications that we have not yet dreamed of. 
Of course, translating this advance into 
practical applications and realizing these 
breakthroughs still require additional research 
and development that will take some time. 
However, the phenomenal achievement of Dr. 
Dias and his team have shown us what is 
possible and, thanks to federal support for 
science, we are closer now than we have ever 
been. I congratulate Ranga on his accomplish-
ments and wish him the greatest success with 
his future research.

ROBERT BLIZZARD—PARAMEDIC 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, today, I 
would like to posthumously recognize Robert 
Blizzard. A man who was guided by his faith 
and love for his family and community. Robert 
was from Newport, New Jersey and strived to 
become an EMT after his father and grand-
father both experienced unacceptably long 
wait times for an ambulance. These events led 
to Robert deciding to create the Downe Town-
ship Rescue Squad. The rescue squad was 
located at his house, and he trained his family 
and members of the community to give med-
ical attention to those who needed it. At the 
same time Robert created the rescue squad, 
he became a certified paramedic. He also held 
positions on the county board of health and 
with the American Heart Association. Robert 
assisted his community in a countless number 
of ways and left a mark on all those that he 
met throughout his life. EMT Paramedics are 
an integral part of our society, and it is people 
like Robert who deserve to be recognized for 
their selfless dedication to helping others. God 
Bless Robert and his family and God Bless 
America.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
my colleagues from Alabama and I are heart-
broken to mourn ten lives cut tragically short 
in a multivehicle crash in Alabama on June 
19, 2021. 
Among the victims we mourn are eight chil-
dren who were part of the Tallapoosa County 
Girls Ranch. The ranch’s mission is to provide 
Christian, family-style residential homes for 
Alabama’s needy, neglected, or abused, 
school-age children. 
We also ask for prayers for the ranch’s di-
rector who sustained injuries in the crash. 
The countless success stories from the 
Tallapoosa County Girls Ranch program are a 
testament to the leadership and community 
they have built over more than five decades. 
The victims’ families, and our entire commu-
nity, is devastated by this loss, but comforted 
in the knowledge that they are now in the lov-
ing arms of Jesus. 
I thank my colleagues for joining me here 
today to show support for a loss that has 
rocked our whole state. Please continue to 
pray for those lives lost and those still recov-
ering.

Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
this week, we mourn the loss of 10 people in 
a terrible multi-car crash on 1–65 in Alabama. 
Among those killed were 9 children, includ-
ing 8 from the Tallapoosa County Girls Ranch, 
a home for neglected and abused children. 
Tragically, they were aged from 4 to 17. 
Also among the dead were a 29-year-old fa-
ther and his 9-month-old daughter. 
I join with my Alabama colleagues today to 
express my deepest, most heartfelt sym-
pathies to all the loved ones and survivors.

HON. GARY J. PALMER 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and remember the lives tragically lost 
last week in the terrible car crash on Interstate 
65. Last Saturday was a heartbreaking day for 
Alabama. Ten lives were taken at once in ter-
rible, unexpected circumstances on one of our 
state’s central interstates. I was heartbroken to 
hear that so many of the crash victims were 
children from the Tallapoosa County Girls 
Ranch, which is part of the Alabama Sheriffs’ 
Boys and Girls ranches. The Tallapoosa 
County Girls Ranch has provided safety and 
care for thousands of neglected children since 
its founding in the 1960s. I want to extend my 
deepest condolences to the parents, friends, 
and siblings who are grieving in the wake of 
this crash. In particular, I want to send my 
sympathies to the director of the Girls’ Ranch, 
Mrs. Candice Gulley, and her husband, who 
lost their two children and two nephews in the 
accident. Few can imagine what they must be 
going through. I honor their dedication to the 
children in their care for so many years, and 
I trust that our state will come around them 
during this time of grief. My prayers are with 
the ranch and with all who lost loved ones in 
this tragedy

JULIA BUCK 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, on April 
7th Julia Buck, a junior in high school, was in 
a terrible car accident with three of her friends 
while driving home after getting ice cream. 
Julia was sitting directly in front of where the 
car was impacted, and she had to be airlifted 
to Cooper University Hospital where she un-
derwent a total of 51 hours of surgery. Julia 
sustained the worst injuries out of her friends, 
but she still wanted to make sure she was 
there to comfort them and held their hands the 
whole time. This past Monday, Julia was re-
leased into rehab, and her strength and perse-
verance led to her being able to stand up for 
the first time in 36 days. Prior to her accident, 
Julia played soccer and basketball and was 
just accepted into the National Honors Soci-
ety. Julia is a living miracle who not only has 
the support of her family and friends, but also 
the South Jersey community. I am praying for 
Julia and her family that she makes a full re-
covery, and I know she will go on to achieve 
great things. God Bless Julia and her family 
and God Bless America.

HON. JERRY L. CARL

Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the lives of the 10 people who perished 
last week in a horrific accident in Butler Coun-
ty, Alabama. This day was especially tragic for 
our state. Losing 10 people in an accident is 
terrible enough, but it’s even worse that 8 of 
them were young, school-aged girls from the 
Tallapoosa Girls Ranch. 
Each of these girls came from rough back-
grounds where they were abused and/or ne-
glected, but at some point they found a family 
and a community at the Tallapoosa Girls 
Ranch. 
I can’t even begin to imagine the grief that 
is felt by the loved ones of these 10 people, 
but I know they will find some comfort knowing 
countless people around the state and the Na-
tion are grieving with them. 
I urge my colleagues and folks everywhere 
to continue keeping the loved ones of these 
10 people in our thoughts and prayers.

Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize Noah Kizer, a Mantua 
Township 
Eagle 
Scout 
who 
achieved 
Scouting’s highest rank. Noah is a senior at 
Clearview Regional High School and plans on

Noah’s Eagle Scout Project consisted of the 
construction and installation of two informa-
tional kiosks for Tall Pines State Preserve. 
Noah guided fellow scouts and adult volun-
teers on this 140-hour project from beginning 
to end. This project was the first Eagle Scout 
Project 
ever 
completed 
for 
Tall 
Pines. 
Throughout his time as a Scout, Noah held 
the positions of Senior Patrol Leader, Quarter-
master, and Patrol Leader. Noah also had the 
amazing opportunity to attend the 2017 Na-
tional Scout Jamboree. He also earned a total 
of 35 merit badges during his time with Troop 
7083. Noah should be proud of all his accom-
plishments, and I wish him the best of luck 
with his future career. God Bless Noah and

HONORING THE 95TH BIRTHDAY OF 
MARGARET EMHARDT JOHNSON 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mar-
garet Emhardt Johnson who is celebrating her 
95th birthday on June 30. She was born into 
the ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ shortly after the 
Great Depression and went on to serve our 
Nation through World War II before raising a 
family of three children. 
Margaret Johnson was born on June 30, 
1926. She grew up in both the Alexandria, Vir-
ginia area, attending George Washington High 
School, and in Coral Gables, Florida before 
leaving to attend Duke University. She was a 
member of the first female graduating class at 
the university in 1947 and is a very fierce Blue 
Devil. Margaret continued her education at 
Howard University where she received her 
Master’s degree in Social Work. Following 
graduation she became a truant officer with 
the Alexandria Police Department so it’s fair to 
say that her kids didn’t skip school very often. 
Margaret met her husband Tom while in Al-
exandria and the two were married for 60 
years. They raised three children together, all 
of whom have master’s degrees in their re-
spective fields as a result of their parent’s firm 
belief in success through education. 
While raising her three kids—Tom, Sarah, 
and Billy—Margaret was still very active in the 
Alexandria community. She served on the Al-
exandria Hospital’s Woman’s Auxiliary, also 
known as the TWIG, while her husband 
served as president of the Alexandria Hospital. 
Margaret also established the Alexandria 
Marching Band competition while her daughter 
was a member of the marching band at T.C. 
Williams High School. This service once again 
complemented her husband’s, as he was the 
president of the Alexandria School Board. 
Margaret and Tom were also active in their 
church. While her husband was on the vestry, 
Margaret served on the Alter Guild for dec-
ades creating flower arrangements. Addition-
ally, both Margaret and Tom assisted in deliv-
ering meals through the Meals-on-Wheels pro-
gram. 
During what little spare time they had, be-
tween raising their children and serving their 
community, Margaret and Tom were voracious 
gardeners. Each year, they would plant doz-
ens of azaleas until their entire yard was cov-
ered, making their backyard a showcase of 
flowers in the spring. In fact, this ‘green- 
thumb’ success culminated in their garden 
being featured in the Washington Post. 
Margaret resumed working full-time after her 
last child left for college. She mastered using 
the PC as the computer revolution began in 
the 1980’s and still enjoys using her Mac to 
create birthday cards for the neighborhood 
children, check her email, and surf the web.

Margaret still lives in the house that she and 
her husband built in 1963, a house that was 
modeled in painstaking detail after one in Wil-
liamsburg, Virginia. She social-distanced while 
living alone during the COVID–19 pandemic 
and used her computer to not only commu-
nicate with friends, family, and neighbors but 
also to shop for grocieries and take-out. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a truly 
remarkable woman who would tell all of us 
that she did nothing remarkable. This is a 
common trait of the Greatest Generation, a 
generation that soldiered on during hardships 
and celebrations alike. 
From a grateful Nation, Happy Birthday Mar-
garet.

HONORING 
THE 
COMMUNITY 
OF 
BEACON 
FALLS, 
CONNECTICUT 
ON THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR 
SESQUICENTENNIAL 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I am very 
proud to rise today to extend my heartfelt con-
gratulations to the Beacon Falls community as 
they gather to celebrate the Town’s 150th An-
niversary—a remarkable milestone for this 
very small community of just over six thou-
sand residents. Though small in number the 
community is mighty in spirit—working to-
gether every day to meet the changing needs 
of its residents while preserving the unique, 
quintessentially New England, rural character 
of the Town. 
Just under ten square miles and bisected by 
the Naugatuck River, Beacon Fall was incor-
porated in 1871 on lands from its neighboring 
towns of Bethany, Naugatuck, Oxford, and 
Seymour. It quickly became a center of agri-
culture, warehouse storage, and manufac-
turing. Beacon Falls was the birthplace of the 
friction matches, first made in 1834 by Thom-
as Sanford, who later sold his ‘‘recipe’’ for 
$10.00. The Diamond Match Company ulti-
mately acquired the formula, The Beacon Falls 
Rubber Shoe Company was a sprawling com-
plex along Main Street that employed many 
residents and was even responsible for the 
construction of an entire neighborhood, pro-
viding housing for its workers. The Homer D. 
Bronson Company also set up shop in town in 
the early 1900s and was a manufacturer of 
hinges used in industry and homes throughout 
the world. 
These 
two 
firms 
promoted 
economic 
wellbeing for Beacon Falls’ residents for years, 
both ultimately closing their doors in the late 
1980s. While their departure left the town in a 
precarious position, it was not long before the 
community rallied, fighting to bring new eco-
nomic engines to the town. Over the course of 
the last several decades, a variety of retail, 
manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and 
service businesses revitalized the town, and 
the community has continued to flourish. 
Today, from the American Legion Post 25 to 
the Beacon Hose Volunteer Fire Company 
and from the Friends of Beacon Falls Library 
to its community center, the residents of this 
small town are more like family than neigh-
bors. The come together in times of celebra-
tion and need—proud of their history and the 
unique fabric that has been woven into this 
special community. 
It has been an honor for me to serve as 
Beacon Falls’ U.S. Representative over the 
last twenty-years and I am proud to have this 
opportunity to extend my heartfelt congratula-
tions to every member of this special commu-
nity as they celebrate their 150th Anniversary.

REVEREND GERRITT KENYON 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize Pastor Gerritt Kenyon, 
and I first want to wish him a very happy be-
lated birthday. Pastor Kenyon turned 90 years 
old last month. Pastor Kenyon, ordained with 
Assemblies of God for 65 years, has served 
on national, state, and sectional levels of the 
denomination. While he was a pastor, he con-
ducted over 13,000 services, 600 weddings, 
3000 funerals, made around 35,000 hospital 
visits, and over 2500 radio and TV programs. 
In his retirement, he keeps his days busy from 
serving as a host for WSNJ ‘‘Music that Mat-
ters’’ radio to a board member of Timothy’s 
Abode in Ecuador, and numerous other com-
mitments such as running a kid’s camp. Pas-
tor Kenyon is also a parent to four children 
and a grandfather to eight grandchildren; sev-
eral of which are in the ministry, and four 
great grandchildren. Pastor Kenyon states that 
‘‘he has enjoyed ministering the message of 
hope to generations of families over this pe-
riod of time,’’ remembering that ‘‘when we 
have done our best, God will do the rest.’’ 
God Bless Pastor Kenyon and his family and 
God Bless America.

RECOGNIZING VICTOR SORACE 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a notable resident within 
my district, Victor Sorace of Boy Scouts of 
America Troop 168. Victor earned the rank of 
Eagle Scout in January of 2020, and I had the 
distinct pleasure of attending his Eagle Scout 
Court of Honor. Victor’s Eagle Scout Service 
Project consisted of building a memorial in 
honor of our community’s armed forces serv-
ice members, police officers, firefighters, and 
first responders. The memorial was built in 
Falls Township Park and stands as a constant 
reminder of the sacrifices those in our commu-
nity and throughout our nation make every sin-
gle day. 
Recently, Victor was recognized as the 
American Legion’s Eagle Scout of the Year for 
the entire state of Pennsylvania. As an Eagle 
Scout myself, I can attest to the fact that this 
is no light achievement. To be the Eagle 
Scout of the Year requires a lot of dedication, 
hard work, and community service. Victor ex-
celled in all of these aspects as he truly is an 
individual who is guided by a sense to better 
his community and has demonstrated an ex-
traordinary ability to overcome complex chal-
lenges and situations throughout the years. 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive im-
pact that he has on our community.

Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize an exceptional 17- 
year-old, Josh Buffington, who positively im-
pacts his community every day. He has been 
a Boy Scout since he was 5 years old and has 
accumulated around 300 hours in community 
service. He has volunteered for scout events 
and projects as well as for local churches. For 
his Eagle project he assisted in cleaning up 
Sacred Heart Cemetery in Cedarbrooke, New 
Jersey where he replaced the split rail fencing 
and installed grave markers. Aside from giving 
back to his community, Josh has played soc-
cer since he was five years old and is also in-
volved in the performing arts, starring in over 
a dozen plays. Josh is preparing to go off to 
college, and hopes to pursue a career in 
sports management. I had the honor of meet-
ing Josh at his Eagle Scout Court of Honor 
earlier this month, and I wish him the best of 
luck with his future endeavors. God Bless 
Joshua and God Bless America.

SALGADO 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Rose Salgado, who passed 
away on May 14, 2021. 
Rose Salgado led a remarkable life not only 
as a mother, daughter, sister, and grand-
mother, but also as a passionate leader and 
champion for the Soboba Band of Luisen˜o In-
dians. Her steadfast commitment to the better-
ment of her Tribal community was undoubt-
edly an inspiration to those around her. There 
is no doubt in my mind that her outstanding 
impact will continue to be felt for generations 
to come. 
Growing up, Rose Salgado took an early in-
terest in her rich Native American heritage. 
Her parents instilled in her the value of a 
strong work ethic that she demonstrated 
throughout her extraordinary career in public 
service. 
After completing her education at University 
of California, Riverside, Salgado began her 
27-year career with Southern California Edi-
son. Following her retirement, Rose became 
deeply involved as a leader in her Tribe and 
served on several boards. During her 28 years 
on the Soboba Tribal Council, she ascended 
to Vice Chairwoman and spearheaded several 
efforts to improve the economic wellbeing and 
access to opportunity for the members of her 
Tribe. 
As a prominent leader and inspiration, she 
was twice recognized as Woman of the Year 
by the Hemet/San Jacinto Valley Chamber of

the community and will continue to be a role 
model for the young men and women who as-
pire to selflessly lead and abundantly serve 
others. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
and honor the life of Rose Salgado. Her re-
markable advocacy for the Soboba Band of 
Luisen˜o Indians and commitment to the com-
munity at large is an example of excellence, 
dedication, and service that all should seek to 
emulate.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF MR. CLARENCE ENNON 
HON. HAKEEM S. JEFFRIES 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Mr. Clarence Ennon, 
who celebrated his 100th birthday on May 13, 
2021. He was born in Cary, Mississippi to 
Aldonia and Solomon Ennon and educated in 
Vicksburg, Mississippi. In 1944, his strong re-
solve and dedication to family, God, and coun-
try lead Mr. Ennon to serve in the United 
States Navy during World War II on a Landing 
Ship Medium as a Steward’s Mate 1st Class 
Petty officer. 
Mr. Ennon has overcome many great obsta-
cles and victories throughout his 100 years of 
life and continues to inspire everyone he en-
counters. A devoted father to 5 children, 11 
grandchildren, 18 great grandchildren and 11 
great-great grandchildren, he has shared 
boundless knowledge from his rich life experi-
ences and instilled a strong faith in God 
amongst his family. In 1964, he moved to 
Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, New York and 
established a dry-cleaning business in Bed-
ford-Stuyvesant. He is a member of First Cal-
vary Baptist Church, where throughout the 
years he has served as church treasurer, dea-
con, and member of the senior choir. 
A military man, a small business entre-
preneur, a homeowner, a family man, Mr. 
Ennon continues to live a fruitful life. He is an 
active gardener and a well-known member of 
the community. 
Mr. Ennon’s accomplishments would not 
have been possible without the love and sup-
port of his family and friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in con-
gratulating Mr. Clarence Ennon, Sr. on his 
100th birthday. 
MARY GRUCCIO 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize and commend Dr. 
Mary Gruccio for overcoming adversity and 
being an inspiration not only to her family, but 
the South Jersey community. Mary has been 
an educator for 46 years, all of which have 
been with the Vineland Public Schools. Mary 
herself even graduated from Vineland High 
School. She is not only an advocate for our 
youth, but she also is a strong believer in giv-
ing back to her community and has been ac-
tive in numerous organizations. One organiza-
tion that is near and dear to her heart, is the 
American Cancer Society. Mary battled both 
cervical and breast cancer, but with the sup-
port of her family and friends she was able to 
beat cancer and now works tirelessly to help 
others in similar situations and make a posi-
tive difference within her community. Mary has 
had a notable career, from being appointed as 
Superintendent, to being inducted into the 
Cumberland County Women’s Hall of Fame in 
2017. Mary also received Cumberland Coun-
ty’s Hometown Heroes award in 2018, and 
she is no doubt just that . . . a hero. I am 
proud to represent South Jersey and Mary is 
one of the many reasons that makes South 
Jersey great. God Bless Mary and her family 
and God Bless America.

RECOGNIZING DR. DUSTIN FROULA 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dustin Froula, the recipient of 
the 2020 Ernest Orlando Lawrence award 
from the United States Department of Energy. 
Dr. Froula is Senior Scientist and Leader of 
the Plasma and Ultrafast Physics Group at the 
Laboratory for Laser Energetics and Associate 
Professor of Physics in the Department of 
Physics and Astronomy at the University of 
Rochester in my district. 
Professor Froula joined the University of 
Rochester in 2010 from the National Ignition 
Facility Inertial Confinement Fusion Directorate 
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
His research interests lie in the fields of exper-
imental plasma and laser physics and covers 
the many areas relevant to inertial confine-
ment fusion and high-energy-density physics. 
The E.O. Lawrence award was established 
in 1959 in honor of a scientist who helped ele-
vate American physics to world leadership and 
recognizes U.S. scientists and engineers in 
nine fields, at mid-career, for exceptional con-
tributions in research and development sup-
porting the Department of Energy and its mis-
sion to advance the national, economic and 
energy security of the United States. Dr. 
Froula received his award in Fusion and Plas-
ma Sciences for innovative research in laser 
plasma 
physics 
including 
pioneering 
spatiotemporal pulse shaping techniques, fo-
cused laser plasma instability research, and 
novel 
high-resolution 
Thomson 
scattering 
methods.

June 25, 2021 
In addition to the Lawrence award, Dr. 
Froula has been previously recognized with 
the 2007 Department of Energy’s Outstanding 
Mentor Award for his work with undergraduate 
and graduate students and the 2019 American 
Physical Society’s John Dawson Award for Ex-
cellence in Plasma Physics Research, ‘‘for in-
novative experiments that demonstrate turbu-
lent dynamo in the laboratory, establishing lab-
oratory experiments as a component in the 
study of turbulent magnetized plasmas, and 
opening a new path to laboratory investiga-
tions of other astrophysical processes.’’ In ad-
dition, he was selected as a fellow of the 
American Physical Society in 2017 for the ‘‘de-
velopment and application of Thomson scat-
tering to understand thermal transport and the 
onset of laser-plasma instabilities in indirect- 
and direct-drive fusion experiments.’’ 
Dr. Froula’s research addresses long-stand-
ing questions in plasma physics, including 
building a better understanding of how laser 
beams propagate through and interact with 
plasmas during laser-based experiments. His 
exceptional contributions have made him an 
internationally recognized expert in the theory 
and utilization of Thomson scattering, includ-
ing co-authoring the definite reference text, 
‘‘Plasma Scattering of Electromagnetic Radi-
ation: Theory and Measurement Techniques’’. 
He helped pioneer the development of using 
Thompson scattering as a measurement tool, 
and it has evolved from a rare and challenging 
experimental technique to a common and rou-
tine experimental diagnostic capability in fun-
damental plasma physics. 
Additionally, Dr. Froula has recently opened 
a new field of optics based on the concept of 
‘‘flying focus,’’ a technique that enables re-
searchers to better control the intensity of la-
sers over long distances. The technique has 
the potential to help researchers design the 
next generation of high-power, laser-driven 
particle accelerators, and light sources with 
novel wavelengths for studying complex mate-
rials and molecules. 
His work to date has been tremendous and 
his contributions to science, leadership and 
mentoring epitomize all the qualities that E.O. 
Lawrence strived for in his lifetime. In sum-
mary, Dr. Froula’s colleagues and students 
know him as an outstanding, innovative sci-
entist and mentor who inspires and involves 
graduate students in world leading plasma 
science research. I am proud to have Dustin 
as a constituent and awed by his numerous 
scientific achievements, including this very de-
serving award. 
TIM BONAVENTURE—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 25, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize Tim Bonaventure, a 
Mantua Township Eagle Scout who achieved 
Scouting’s highest rank. Tim is a senior at 
Clearview Regional High School, and he plans 
on attending the School of Music at the Uni-
versity of Delaware in the fall. For his Eagle 
Scout Project, Tim got together a group of 
scouts to construct outdoor seating for the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. Tim and the group 
of scouts built 8-foot picnic tables, 4-foot 
benches, and one 11-foot bench. With the 
help of his fellow scouts and adult volunteers, 
the project took nearly 170 hours to complete. 
Tim was the Assistant Patrol leader for two 
years, then served as Patrol Leader, and 
moved up to become the Senior Patrol Lead-
er. Throughout his time as a scout, he earned 
29 merit badges. I wish Tim the best of luck 
in his future endeavors, and I know he will 
achieve anything he puts his mind to. God 
Bless Tim and God Bless America.
