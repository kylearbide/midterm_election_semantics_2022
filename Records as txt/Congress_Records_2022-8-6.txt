SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we 
approach the culmination of one of the 
most productive stretches in recent 
Senate memory. It began almost 2 
months ago when, in the wake of un-
imaginable bloodshed in Buffalo and 
Uvalde, the Senate came together and 
passed the first gun safety law in near-
ly 30 years. 
A few weeks later, in the face of the 
damaging semiconductor shortage, the 
Senate approved the largest invest-
ment in American manufacturing and 
scientific research in decades. 
This week, we finally told American 
veterans with cancer, lung disease, and 
other terrible ailments that their wait 
for their benefits was over by passing 
the PACT Act. 
And a few days ago, as Russian ag-
gression toward Ukraine continues, we 
swiftly approved the accession of Swe-
den and Finland to the NATO alliance, 
greatly strengthening that alliance in 
the face of Russian aggression. 
Gun safety, chips, veterans, NATO— 
all of this we got done in under 6 
weeks. And, now, we have one more 
groundbreaking item left, the most im-
portant of them all: the Inflation Re-
duction Act. Passing any one of these 
bills in a summer would be significant. 
Yet we are on the verge of getting all

August 6, 2022 
of them done before the August State 
work period. 
In a few hours, we will formally begin 
the process of passing the Inflation Re-
duction Act of 2022 by voting on the 
motion to proceed. Our meetings with 
the Parliamentarian have now largely 
concluded, and we thank her and her 
staff for their hard work and diligence 
on such a large bill in such a short pe-
riod of time. And now that our meet-
ings with the Parliamentarian have 
largely concluded, we have a bill before 
us that can win the support of all 50 
Democrats. 
I am happy to report to my col-
leagues that the bill we presented to 
the Parliamentarian remains largely 
intact. The bill, when passed, will meet 
all of our goals: fighting climate 
change, 
lowering 
healthcare 
costs, 
closing tax loopholes abused by the 
wealthy, and reducing the deficit. 
This is a major win for the American 
people and a sad commentary on the 
Republican Party as they actively 
fight provisions that lower costs for 
the American family. 
As the Inflation Reduction Act works 
its way through the floor, the Amer-
ican people are going to learn an un-
mistakable truth about this proposal: 
It was written, first and foremost, with 
the American people in mind. It re-
duces inflation, it lowers their costs, 
and it fights climate change. For sen-
iors who have faced the indignity of ra-
tioning medications or skipping them 
altogether, the Inflation Reduction Act 
will lower prescription drug costs and 
finally cap out-of-pocket expenses. 
For families that have fallen behind 
on the electric bill while trying to stay 
cool through a heat wave, this bill will 
lower energy costs and provide the 
largest investment in clean energy ever 
in American history. For every child 
deprived of clean air and a neighbor-
hood where they can play safely out-
side, away from smog and exhaust 
fumes, this bill will help reverse air 
pollution and help clean up commu-
nities that have endured the shadow of 
congested 
highways 
and 
industrial 
sites. And, as the most significant ac-
tion of climate change ever, it will help 
deliver our children and grandchildren 
the planet they deserve. 
The Inflation Reduction Act was 
written with the American people in 
mind: families struggling to pay the 
bills, kids who struggle with asthma 
and pollution, seniors who can’t afford 
lifesaving medications. This bill is for 
them. 
For many years, many in Washington 
promised to address some of the big-
gest challenges facing our Nation, only 
to fall short. Many have talked about 
the need to act on climate change, the 
need to hold drug companies account-
able, the need to make the Tax Code 
fairer. But where previous efforts have 
fallen short, this Senate majority is on 
the verge of succeeding. 
After years of trying, we will finally 
empower Medicare to negotiate the 
price of prescription drug costs. After 
years of trying, we will finally cap out- 
of-pocket expenses and make vaccines 
free for our seniors. 
After years of trying, after years of 
Americans calling for action—particu-
larly our young people—Congress will 
pass the largest clean energy package 
ever. We will cut emissions by 40 per-
cent by 2030, helping us avert the worst 
consequences of a warming planet. 
That is a huge goal, and we are going 
to meet it. We will prevent nearly 4,000 
deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks each 
year by reducing air pollution. We will 
save Americans money on their utility 
bill by making it easier for them to tap 
into clean energy and expand incen-
tives for utility companies to explore 
cleaner ways to generate power. We 
will make it easier to finally usher in 
the era of greater solar and wind 
power, battery storage, and EVs and 
bring manufacturing of this technology 
back to America. We will restore coast-
lines, regenerate our forests, shield 
communities everywhere from the dan-
ger of droughts and sweltering heat 
waves. 
Through it all, we will create more 
than 9 million jobs over the next dec-
ade—good-paying union jobs—an aver-
age of nearly a million a year. So many 
of those jobs, as I said, will be good- 
paying union jobs. 
From the moment Democrats an-
nounced the Inflation Reduction Act, 
Senate Republicans have fruitlessly 
tried every approach under the sun to 
lay a glove on our bill. 
First, they said our bill will make in-
flation worse, only to give up on that 
once everyone from Larry Summers to 
Hank Paulson, to seven Nobel laure-
ates said it would do the opposite. 
Then they tried calling our bill a bill of 
tax hikes on the middle class before 
changing their minds and actually ad-
mitting that the bill contains no tax 
rate increases at all for the middle 
class. 
At every turn, they have resorted to 
the decades-old talking point of calling 
our bill nothing but wasteful spending, 
conveniently ignoring that our bill, in 
fact, lowers the deficit and is com-
pletely paid for. 
I will grant my Republican col-
leagues that their task is not easy. By 
one measure, over 65 percent of Ameri-
cans support the policies in the Infla-
tion Reduction Act, and other polls re-
flect the same. Republicans haven’t 
been able to get around the fact that 
Americans like that we are letting 
Medicare negotiate the price of pre-
scription drugs. They like that we will 
close tax loopholes that allow billion- 
dollar companies to pay zero in taxes. 
Voices across the country, from Nobel- 
winning economists to former Treasury 
Secretaries, to even Republican movie 
star ex-Governors, have all praised the 
Inflation Reduction Act as an infla-
tion-fighting, climate-saving, job-cre-
ating piece of legislation. 
At a time of seemingly impenetrable 
gridlock, the Inflation Reduction Act 
will show the American people that 
when the moment demands it, Congress 
is still capable of taking big steps to 
solve big challenges. We will show the 
American people that, yes, we are ca-
pable of passing a historic climate 
package and rein in drug companies 
and make our Tax Code fairer. We are 
able to make big promises and work 
hard at keeping them as well. 
We know that Republicans will con-
tinue their mightiest to try to smear 
our work before the bill is passed. This 
isn’t our first time going through the 
reconciliation process, and no one is 
going to be surprised when the other 
side comes up with wild, misleading, 
and wholly partisan amendments that 
have nothing—nothing—to do with our 
bill. These efforts will not deter us. No 
matter how long it takes, the Senate is 
going to stay in session to finish this 
bill. 
In short, this is one of the most com-
prehensive and far-reaching pieces of 
legislation that has come before the 
Congress in decades. It will help just 
about every citizen in this country and 
make America a much better place. 
We are not leaving until the job is 
done. The American people deserve 
nothing less. So let’s get to work 
today.

consent that following the vote on the 
motion to discharge the Uhlmann nom-
ination, the Senate execute the pre-

MOTION TO DISCHARGE—Continued 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
FLOODING IN KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Eastern Kentucky is again facing the 
threat of stormy weather and flash 
floods this weekend. Emergency re-
sponders have been on the ground since 
the flooding began and will continue 
their critical role in the coming days. 
We are making sure the Federal Gov-
ernment is stepping up as well. 
In addition to the Governor and 
State lawmakers, I have been in per-
sonal contact with the President, Sec-
retaries Mayorkas and Becerra, and 
FEMA Administrator Criswell going 
back to the beginning of this emer-
gency. 
FEMA has been on the ground since 
day one, providing enormous help with 
search and rescue operations. Once re-
building begins, their role will only be 
more important. 
With the President’s major disaster 
declaration, FEMA is now authorized 
to send financial assistance directly to 
the flood victims. These funds will be 
critical to those who lost their homes 
in the flooding, especially since many 
lack flood insurance. To reach remote 
residents, FEMA representatives are 
going door-to-door and speaking di-
rectly to survivors in shelters to make 
sure everyone who qualifies for help ac-
tually receives it. The Agency has al-
ready approved hundreds of thousands 
of dollars for affected Kentuckians. 
FEMA is also helping pull together a 
wide swath of Federal Agencies to sup-
plement the Kentucky National Guard 
and State agencies. The Forest Service 
is already on the ground, clearing de-
bris from roadways. The Small Busi-
ness Administration is issuing loans to 
help employers rebuild. The Army 
Corps of Engineers is ensuring all dams 
in the region remain operational. 
The Federal response so far has been 
extraordinary. 
I have been proud to stand with the 
Governor and Kentucky’s entire con-
gressional delegation to help expand 
the number of counties receiving as-
sistance and streamline the aid. Ken-
tuckians can visit my official website 
to see the full list of services offered by 
our Federal disaster response Agencies. 
The Federal Government has done an 
excellent job so far. The crisis is far 
from over. 
Soon, I will visit the region myself to 
meet with flood victims and listen to 
their concerns, and then I will take 
what I hear from my constituents back 
to Washington and ensure we stand by 
their side as we rebuild bigger and bet-
ter than before. 
INFLATION 
Madam President, now on an entirely 
different matter, a year and a half ago, 
Democrats misread a 50–50 Senate as a 
mandate for $1.9 trillion in party-line 
reckless spending. The result has been 
the worst inflation in 40 years. 
With Democrats in charge, working 
families are having to spend thousands 
of extra dollars each year just to tread 
water. Grocery costs are through the 
roof. Energy bills are skyrocketing. 
Gas prices are more than $1 higher 
than on Inauguration Day. American 
families are trapped in an inflation spi-
ral, where many workers have earned 
pay raises on paper, but even those big-
ger paychecks buy them less and less 
every time they go to the store. 
Because of Democrats’ historic fail-
ure on the economy, the American peo-
ple have lost their patience. Ninety 
percent say they are feeling anxious 
about inflation. Only 28 percent like 
what President Biden is doing about it, 
and just 22 percent think we will be in 
any better shape after another year of 
Democratic 
leadership. 
But, 
amaz-
ingly, 
Senate 
Democrats 
are 
misreading the American people’s out-
rage as a mandate for yet another—yet 
another—reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree. Democrats have already robbed 
American families once through infla-
tion, and now their solution is to rob 
American families yet a second time. 
Democrats want to ram through hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes 
and hundreds of billions of dollars in 
reckless spending—and for what? For a 
so-called inflation bill that will not 
meaningfully reduce inflation at all 
and will actually make inflation even 
worse in the short term; for a so-called 
economic bill that will kill American 
jobs and hammer our manufacturing 
sector; for a so-called climate bill that 
will have no meaningful impact on 
global temperatures whatsoever; for a 
so-called prescription drug bill that 
will result in fewer lifesaving medi-
cines and higher prices for the new 
cures that are invented. Every fact I 
have just laid out has come from non-
partisan experts and academics. 
Democrats’ bill will do nothing to 
meaningfully cut inflation. Hundreds 
of billions of dollars in tax hikes on a 
struggling 
economy 
will 
help 
kill 
American jobs everywhere, except the 
IRS, that is, where the bill would fund 
the hiring of—listen to this—86,000 new 
tax collectors plus new cars and new 
computers. 
Jacking up Americans’ electricity 
bills and gas prices in order to sub-
sidize rich people buying luxury cars 
and new appliances will not make one 
dent in the future trajectory of global 
temperatures. 
Democrats will choke off the devel-
opment of new lifesaving medicines if 
they 
pretend 
that 
making 
things 
cheaper is as simple as passing a law 
saying they ought to be cheaper. 
Survey after survey, poll after poll 
has proven that none of this nonsense 
is what American people want Demo-
crats to focus on. The American people 
don’t want hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in Green New Deal waste. They 
want less inflation, not more. Amer-
ican families don’t want tens of thou-
sands more IRS agents. What they 
would like are more Border Patrol and 
ICE agents. American families don’t 
want Democrats policing what kinds of 
stoves and clothes dryers they can put 
in their homes. What they want is for 
Democrats to actually start policing 
our city streets. 
Democrats have decided their first 
economic disaster justifies a second 
economic disaster. The working people 
of this country feel very, very dif-
ferently. 
Now, on a related matter. I want to 
drill down on Democrats’ plan to take 
a buzz saw to the research and develop-
ment behind new lifesaving medical 
treatment and cures. The American 
people have enough common sense to 
know that the government can’t actu-
ally make something cost less by mak-
ing it illegal to raise the price. Let me 
say that again. The government can’t 
actually make something cost less by 
making it illegal to raise its price. 
This was the logic of college sopho-
more socialism. It is not fair that a 
certain thing costs more than we like. 
Why doesn’t the government simply 
pass a law making it cheaper? 
Well, the world would be a lot easier 
for everybody if things actually worked 
that way. It would certainly be easier 
to be a member of Congress. We could 
just vote to set the price of everything 
in America, snap our fingers and every-
body in the country would enjoy $5 
smartphones, $10 TVs, and $100 pickup 
trucks. What a concept. Why hasn’t 
anybody thought of this genius idea be-
fore? 
Well, of course, people have thought 
of it before. Plenty of governments 
have tried crude price-fixing—Cuba, 
Venezuela, the old Soviet Union, not 
exactly thriving paradises, not pin-
nacles of prosperity, well-being, or in-
novation; not the examples we would 
want to follow. 
Everybody wants prescription drugs 
and complex medicines to be more af-
fordable. Everybody wants to help 
struggling families. That is the goal we 
all share. But you know what would 
not achieve that goal? Empowering 
some Biden administration bureaucrat 
to sit down at a desk and arbitrarily 
name the price that manufacturers can 
charge. 
Democrats’ policy would not bring 
about some paradise where we all get

amazing new innovations we would 
have gotten anyway, but at a lower 
cost. Their policy would bring about a 
world where many fewer new drugs and 
treatments get invented in the first 
place as companies cut back on R&D. 
By one analysis, if Democrats’ price- 
fixing scheme had already been in 
place, 104 of 110 major new medicines 
released in the past decade may never 
have made it to the market. We would 
literally have fewer lifesaving cures 
and treatments. More Americans would 
die and die young under Democrats’ 
policy. And the new drugs that did still 
get invented would be more expensive 
when they hit the market. That is ac-
cording to the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office. 
During the Obama administration, I 
worked with then-Vice President Biden 
on a project he was especially pas-
sionate about. I was proud to help 
launch his Cancer Moonshot within the 
21st Century Cures bill. But according 
to one expert’s calculation, the bill 
President Biden wants Senate Demo-
crats to ram through this weekend 
would reduce cancer research spending 
by more than nine times as much as 
our Cancer Moonshot expanded it. I 
will say that one more time. According 
to one expert, this far-left takeover of 
America’s medicine cabinets would de-
stroy nine times as much cancer fund-
ing as we provided with the Cancer 
Moonshot. 
We are talking about a tidal wave of 
Washington meddling, wiping out fu-
ture treatments and cures for Ameri-
cans suffering with rare diseases. What 
a terrible, terrible and tragic part of 
their reckless plans.

August 6, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise 
briefly to speak to a unanimous con-
sent request that I am going to make 
in just a moment. I am pleased that we 
are about to consider the nomination 
of Dr. Monde Muyangwa, to be Assist-
ant 
Administrator 
for 
Africa 
for 
USAID. 
This is a critical post, one we cannot 
afford to leave vacant at a time when 
the humanitarian needs, the develop-
ment opportunities, the strategic chal-
lenges that we see in Africa need to be 
met by an outstanding development 
professional. 
As the ongoing Russian aggression in 
Ukraine 
continues 
to 
cause 
sky-
rocketing fertilizer costs, widespread 
food crises, the people of Africa need to 
know that the people of the United 
States will support them, will work 
with them, and will be a great partner 
in their development. 
I am about to ask unanimous consent 
for the confirmation of a nominee who 
has a long and deep experience in this 
area. The director of the Wilson Center 
Africa Program, long-time dean of the 
Africa Center for Strategic Studies at 
the National Defense University, a pro-
fessor, a nonprofit leader, a develop-
ment professional, a Rhodes Scholar— 
someone who will represent us very 
well. 
Madam President, with that, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the follow nomination: Calendar 
No. 815, Monde Muyangwa, to be an As-
sistant Administrator for the United 
States Agency for International Devel-
opment; that the Senate vote on the 
nomination without intervening action 
or debate; that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action, 
and the Senate resume legislative ses-
sion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Monde Muyangwa, of Mary-
land, to be an Assistant Administrator 
of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nomination. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Muyangwa nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION—Continued 
Mr. COONS. With that, I yield to my 
colleague from the State of Illinois. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, 
let me say I am joining in with the ac-
tion just taken by the Senate, led by 
Senator COONS, who has shown an ex-
traordinary gift of understanding of 
the importance of the African con-
tinent and the people that need to be 
part of its future. 
I wholeheartedly support the effort 
which he initiated on the floor this 
afternoon. And I believe that Dr. 
Muyangwa is going to be a valuable 
asset to AID and to Africa, and I thank 
him for his leadership in bringing this 
issue before us today. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
United States has done some good, im-
portant, even historic work this week. 
On Tuesday, we passed the PACT Act, 
expanding VA healthcare to an esti-
mated 3.5 million veterans. Their serv-
ice to our Nation exposed them to po-
tentially deadly toxic chemicals from 
Agent Orange in the Vietnam conflict 
to toxic burn pits, which were found to 
be ubiquitous in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
It took too long: 12 years. Toxic ex-
posed veterans and family members 
had to stand on the steps of the Cap-
itol, literally camped out for 5 days 
and nights to remind us that the vet-
erans suffering from toxic exposure de-
serve care as surely as veterans injured 
by bullets and bombs. 
But in the end, thank goodness, we 
did the right thing. The vote to pass 
the PACT Act was 86 to 11—86 votes in 
a 50–50 Democratic/Republican Cham-
ber. It was a remarkable, bipartisan 
rollcall. 
And then we made history this week 
when the Senate voted to ratify the 
entry of Finland and Sweden to NATO. 
Vladimir Putin gambled that Russia 
could seize Ukraine in just a few days, 
could 
use 
his 
victory 
to 
shatter 
NATO’s unity and to deepen divides 
around the world. 
Vladimir Putin, again, was dead 
wrong. NATO is more united, larger, 
and more powerful than ever, while 
Vladimir Putin has become an inter-
national pariah. Russia’s military is 
bogged down in Ukraine, suffering 
heavy losses. And the Russian economy 
is staggering under the weight of glob-
al sanctions imposed by the freedom- 
loving nations of the world against 
Russia. 
The Senate vote in favor of enlarging 
NATO to include Sweden and Finland 
was 95 to 1—95 votes in favor of it in a 
body that is divided equally, 50–50. Two 
major achievements in just 2 days, 
both with huge bipartisan majorities. 
That is proof for the doubters that the 
Senate can work together when the 
need is urgent and the solutions are 
just. 
Now we are debating another historic 
plan that should have the support of 
both parties. I listen to the speeches 
each day on the floor of the Senate. 
And every day our Republican col-
leagues stand on the floor and say it is 
about time we did something about in-
flation. They know that is exactly the 
way the American families feel—and I 
feel, as well. And then, sadly, when 
given a chance, as they will be in just 
a few minutes, my Republican friends 
try to stop legislation that will lower 
the cost and give American families a 
break on their cost of living. All the 
speeches notwithstanding, they refuse 
to vote for a provision which will actu-
ally lower families’ living costs. 
They oppose cutting taxes for fami-
lies. 
They 
oppose 
banning 
price 
gouging by oil companies. They oppose 
cutting healthcare premiums. They op-
pose extending the Child Tax Credits. 
They oppose lowering prescription drug 
prices. But we are going to give them 
another chance to do the right thing. 
They are going to have a chance to 
actually lower some of those big ticket 
costs which they gave all their speech-
es about and—listen to this bonus—re-
duce the deficit at the same time. Yes, 
the Democrats have a proposal which 
will reduce our national debt by $300 
billion. Our plan is called the Inflation 
Reduction Act. It does exactly what it 
says and even more. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will cut 
energy costs, now and in the future, by 
deploying American-made clean energy 
and by making the biggest investment 
to battle the climate crisis in U.S. his-
tory. 
You can’t miss on the news the ter-
rible things that have happened in the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky in the last 
week. Horrible things. Thirty-seven 
people—at least 37 people—have lost 
their lives with the flooding in that 
State. They go to these remote, rural 
villages. It just breaks your heart to 
look at the devastation. 
And the reporters go to families still, 
I guess, trying to get back on their 
feet, trying to imagine tomorrow and 
do these interviews. And many times, 
the people are clearly in pain and dis-
traught over their personal losses. 
There was one man I remember yes-
terday, particularly. He did not appear 
to be the kind of person who spends a 
lot of time thinking about Congres-
sional issues or even great political 
issues. He was a fellow, a hardworking 
fellow, who just lost his home. And you 
know what he said? He said: This is cli-
mate change; what you are looking at 
here is climate change. I have lived in 
this town for 40 years. And I have never 
seen anything like that. And I can’t 
imagine if it comes again. 
For him to use the words ‘‘climate 
change’’ really was an eye opener for 
me, because it means that he is sen-
sitized to the reality that we face in 
this world. Extreme weather has be-
come the norm in our country, whether 
it is an extreme drought, an extreme 
flooding 
situation, 
more 
tornadoes 
than ever at different times of the 
year. The list goes on and on. 
Some people think it is just God 
being restless. I think there is more to 
it. I think we—those of us who inhabit

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 6, 2022 
this planet Earth—bear some responsi-
bility. 
The question is, will we give speech-
es, will we lament these extreme 
weather events, or will do something? 
That is why this bill that is coming up 
today, 
starting 
today, 
subject 
to 
amendment, is so important. We can’t 
allow our energy and national security 
to be dictated by some foreign power or 
some foreign leader like Vladimir 
Putin or anyone else who doesn’t share 
America’s national interest. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, which 
is coming before us, invests in clean, 
new American energy sources so that 
our future can be determined by Amer-
ican ingenuity, not by some foreign 
cartel or some Kremlin kleptocrat. 
Earlier today, the Senator from Ken-
tucky came to the floor and talked 
about the EPA police checking on 
whether people are buying certain 
products or not buying other products. 
That isn’t what this bill is about at all. 
Incentives are there. And I—just from 
a family point of view—am going to 
take a look at it. Is it time for my fam-
ily to buy a heat pump? I will take a 
look and see. Tax credits, tax incen-
tives could be an incentive for me to 
make that decision with my family and 
my wife. And that is all that we are of-
fering—incentives for people to choose 
the right things, the environmentally 
smart things to deal with climate 
change. 
The more energy solutions we dis-
cover, the cheaper our energy bills will 
be. Importantly, the Inflation Reduc-
tion 
Act 
will 
enable 
the 
United 
States—listen to this—to cut green-
house gas emissions by an estimated 40 
percent by the year 2030. 
We have a lot of young pages here 
who come and work in the summer. We 
are glad to have them. They brighten 
up the place, and their energy is a 
sight to behold. They probably listen 
to this debate and wonder if these 
graying politicians, these Senators and 
Congressman, really do care about the 
planet that they are going to be living 
on, raising their own families, building 
their own futures. Well, this bill is an 
indication we do care. And to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions not only does 
the right thing for America, it sets an 
example for the world. Despite all the 
excuses, there is no excuse for ignoring 
climate change, as that poor fellow 
down in Kentucky made obvious. 
For anyone who still says global 
warming is a hoax—and I guess there 
are a handful of those folks left—or ad-
mits that it is real and says we just 
can’t afford to fix it, know this: The 
costs of ignoring the climate crisis are 
far greater than dealing with it. 
A recent analysis by the Office of 
Management and Budget warns, if left 
unchecked, climate change could re-
duce our Nation’s gross domestic prod-
uct by 10 percent and cost Americans 
$2 trillion a year by the end of the cen-
tury—$2 trillion in the production of 
goods and services. 
To put that in perspective, that is 
about a third of the entire U.S. budget 
this year. And in case you are dis-
missing these warnings because they 
happen to come from a Democrat or 
from the Biden administration, maybe 
you should listen to Deloitte—a well- 
known accounting firming in this 
country—their center for sustainable 
management. They released a report in 
May estimating that left unchecked, 
climate change will cost the global 
economy $178 trillion for the next 50 
years. If rising sea levels don’t swamp 
us, rising costs of ignoring climate dis-
asters very well may. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will en-
able us to make reasonable changes 
now that will pay for themselves many 
times over. It will also cut families’ 
healthcare costs in four important 
ways. First, we extend the enhanced 
Affordable Care Act subsidies for 13 
million Americans for 3 more years. 
I was so surprised to read recently 
that there are still 8 million Americans 
uninsured. There should be none. And 
our goal is none. But we made such 
dramatic progress cutting by a third to 
a half the number of people uninsured 
since the passage of the Affordable 
Care Act. 
Have you ever had a young child in 
your family who was sick and you wor-
ried because you had no health insur-
ance as to whether they would be seen 
by the right doctor, the right hospital? 
I went through it. It happened right 
after our first child was born. We didn’t 
have health insurance. I never felt 
more vulnerable, and I never had an 
emptier feeling when it came to being 
a father caring for his child as to not 
have health insurance and worrying 
about that. I don’t think any family 
should ever have to go through that. It 
is an experience I will never forget. 
Second, our plan allows Medicare to 
finally negotiate fair prices for pre-
scription drugs. I listened to the Re-
publican leader on the floor this morn-
ing talking about what a terrible idea 
that is. 
Well, I just want to suggest to him, 
we have been doing that at the Vet-
erans’ Administration for years. They 
have been negotiating pharmaceutical 
prices so that our veterans get afford-
able drugs and taxpayers get a break 
and don’t have to subsidize them. That, 
to me, is just common sense, and it is 
humane. The notion that we are going 
to extend that to Medicare recipients is 
not a radical idea. It involves some-
thing that we think is fundamental to 
the free market economy: competition. 
If 
these 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
want to sell their drugs to the Medi-
care recipients, we say to them, let’s 
negotiate, on a certain number of those 
drugs, reasonable prices. 
Now, some people say that is too 
much government, government step-
ping in there and trying to establish 
the prices that will be paid for these 
pharmaceuticals. 
Well, I would say to the same phar-
maceutical companies that are raising 
these objections: Look what you are 
doing today in Canada. You take ex-
actly the same drug made here in the 
United States, sold to Americans at an 
inflated price, and sell it at a deep dis-
count to people living in Canada. Why 
do you do it? Is it out of the kindness 
of your heart? No. The Canadian Gov-
ernment stood up and said you are not 
going to gouge Canadian families. Yes, 
we would like to have your pharma-
ceuticals and, yes, we will put them in 
our formulary, but you cannot dictate 
the prices to us. We are going to nego-
tiate those prices. And the pharma-
ceutical companies sat down and did 
it—not just in Canada but in Europe. 
When you say the same thing in the 
United States, that they treat Ameri-
cans and those under Medicare the way 
they treat Canadians, you have the 
Senator from Kentucky coming to the 
floor and calling it a college sophomore 
socialist answer. I don’t think so. I 
think it is just common sense. 
These pharmaceutical companies are 
some of the most profitable companies 
in the United States year in and year 
out. They make money hand over fist. 
And I am glad they do, in many re-
spects, because they can invest that 
money in the next generation of drugs. 
You say to yourself: Wait a minute. 
If you are going to give them less for 
the product, they will have less for re-
search. Not necessarily because there 
is something that you ought to remem-
ber that I think is very important. I 
want to make sure I get these figures 
right. The big pharmaceutical compa-
nies today spend more on advertising 
than on research. 
Let me give you a couple of exam-
ples. Bayer, one of the makers of 
Xarelto—you have heard that one, 
haven’t you, on TV—spent $18 billion 
on sales and marketing, $18 billion. 
How much did they spend on research 
for new drugs and new products? Eight 
billion. More than twice as much of the 
research budget went to be spent on 
marketing and television advertising. 
Incidentally, the United States is 
only one of two nations in the world 
that allows direct-to-consumer drug 
advertising. The other one is New Zea-
land, if you can imagine. They put all 
this money on television advertising 
drugs like Xarelto. Why? So that peo-
ple say: Wait a minute. Maybe that is 
what I have needed all along. I have to 
write down that name. How do you 
spell ‘‘Xarelto?’’ They get it right, fi-
nally, because ads keep coming on hour 
after hour on television, and they go to 
the doctor and say: I need Xarelto. 
The 
doctor 
may 
have 
second 
thoughts about whether that is a good 
drug, but he doesn’t have a lot of time 
for each patient. He is not going to de-
bate his customers. He ends up writing 
a script for a high-priced drug like 
Xarelto, and Bayer makes more money. 
They are not the only ones. Johnson 
& Johnson—that is a pretty well- 
known company. They spent $22 billion 
on sales and marketing. How much, if 
they spent $22 billion on sales and mar-
keting, did they spend on research? 
Twelve—twelve. Do you see a pattern 
here?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4057 
August 6, 2022 
To be fair, not all of pharma’s big 
bucks go into TV ads. Over the past 5 
years, the 14 largest drug corporations 
spent more on stock buybacks lining 
the pockets of their CEOs than on 
R&D. Remember what I just said. They 
took their profits, turned them into 
stock buybacks so that the wealthiest 
people in America got a better balance 
sheet. Money that could have gone into 
research for new drugs, they diverted 
into profit-taking. So this notion about 
saying that Medicare should be able to 
negotiate more competitive and fairly 
priced drugs is not unreasonable, and it 
isn’t going to stop research. We know 
that. 
Can I add one other element to this? 
Each of these pharmaceutical compa-
nies has a benefactor, a major bene-
factor. Think of it. It is an Agency that 
generates research by the billions each 
year, and the product of that re-
search—which is a suggestion for new 
drugs, for example—is literally given 
to the pharmaceutical industry to use 
and make a profit. What is that Agen-
cy? The National Institutes of Health. 
It does the basic research by the Fed-
eral Government, paid for by American 
taxpayers—billions 
of 
dollars—and 
makes it available to pharmaceutical 
companies to develop the next genera-
tions of drugs. That is as it should be. 
But this notion that the pharma-
ceutical companies are just making it 
on their own and their own skills goes 
way beyond the obvious. NIH is helping 
very much. 
We want to cut healthcare costs to 
make sure as well that seniors cap 
their out-of-pocket prescription drug 
costs at $2,000 a year, and $2,000 a year 
is still a sacrifice for many seniors, but 
it is a reasonable amount. We know 
what is happening now. Many seniors 
have drugs that they are supposed to be 
taking. They can’t afford to fill the 
prescriptions or they take half the dose 
when they should be taking a full dos-
age. That is the reality of the prescrip-
tion drug pricing in America. 
Is it a serious problem? Well, just ask 
Blue Cross Blue Shield in Chicago, and 
I have: What is the impact of these in-
flated 
prescription 
drug 
prices 
on 
healthcare premiums? Blue Cross Blue 
Shield said to me that it is the No. 1 
driver of increased health insurance 
premium costs, the cost of prescription 
drugs. 
So when we start bringing down 
these costs, we are also going to create 
a situation where we have less incen-
tive to increase premiums for health 
insurance. 
Fourth, we penalize drug companies 
if they try to increase the price of the 
drug more than the rate of inflation. 
That was another on the list of sopho-
more in college socialist ideas, accord-
ing to the Republican leader on the 
floor this morning. Well, I think he is 
wrong. We know what happens to the 
price of these drugs year in and year 
out. They just don’t go up with the 
cost of inflation, they go up by mul-
tiples that reach the point people can’t 
afford to pay it. That has to come to an 
end. 
Five years ago, Republicans used this 
same process we are using called rec-
onciliation to pass a nearly $2 trillion 
tax bill that overwhelmingly benefited 
big corporations and the wealthiest 
people in America, and they put the 
whole boondoggle on the credit card. It 
was unpaid for—tax cuts unpaid for. 
They claimed their tax cuts would pay 
for themselves. Dynamic scoring, they 
called it. Instead, they blew up the na-
tional debt. 
Our plan is paid for, and here is the 
bottom line: No one in America—no 
one earning less than $400,000 a year— 
is seeing any increase in their taxes. 
Now, the Republicans say: Well, if you 
raise taxes on the wealthiest people, it 
is going to hurt the poorest people. 
When it gets right down to it, many of 
these corporations are extremely prof-
itable—a billion dollars a year in prof-
its and pay no Federal taxes. What is 
wrong with this picture? 
The average American family is pay-
ing their taxes, as the law requires, and 
yet these corporations have found an 
escape hatch to avoid paying any taxes 
whatsoever. If they pay any taxes, they 
are going to hurt the poor families. 
The poor families are doing their part 
to pay their taxes. It is time these 
wealthy individuals and corporations 
did the same. 
Instead of adding to the national 
debt, as our Republican colleagues did 
with their tax cuts for corporations 
and the wealthy, our proposal that we 
will vote on today will reduce the def-
icit by $300 billion. That is on top of 
the $1.7 trillion we have already cut 
from the deficit this year. Cutting the 
deficit reduces inflation pressure in the 
long run. In the short term, we are 
fighting inflation by lowering the cost 
of energy and healthcare, two of the 
biggest ticket items in family budgets. 
And lastly, Senator MCCONNELL and 
our Republican colleagues seem to 
have developed a great respect for the 
economic wisdom of former Treasury 
Secretary Larry Summers. I can’t tell 
you how many times Senator MCCON-
NELL has mentioned Larry Summers’ 
name as if he is the great leader of all 
the great thinkers in the economics 
field in America. Let me tell you what 
Mr. Summers happens to say about our 
plan that we are going to vote for 
today and that all the Republicans are 
going to oppose. He said: 
This bill is fighting inflation. 
He also said: 
This is an easy bill to get behind. 
I didn’t hear that this morning when 
Senator MCCONNELL came to the floor 
and talked about his view of this bill. 
Larry Summers was his expert pre-
viously. Now he is ignoring when Sum-
mers says we ought to vote for this bill 
to reduce inflation. 
Do our Republican friends really 
want to tame inflation and help fami-
lies with energy and healthcare or just 
come to the floor and complain? That 
is the choice they have. If they want to 
help, we have a plan. It is fair; it is 
paid for; it fights inflation; and it low-
ers the deficit. Wouldn’t it be great if 
they would join us in a bipartisan ef-
fort to pass this at this moment in his-
tory? It is what America is waiting for 
and looking for. I hope that a number 
of Republicans will surprise us and join 
us. 
I yield the floor.

f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it is 
good to be back in the Senate. Like a 
number of my colleagues, after dodging 
the virus for 2 years, it finally caught 
up with me last weekend. I spent a 
week in quarantine and, fortunately, 
experienced only mild symptoms. I 
think that is because I was fully vac-
cinated and boosted and I was glad to 
have the help of modern science on my 
side. 
There is never a good time to be 
away from our work here in the Sen-
ate, but we all have a responsibility to 
keep those around us safe as well, no 
matter 
how 
inconvenient. 
Unfortu-
nately, there are reports that our 
friends across the aisle may be inten-
tionally disregarding that responsi-
bility. I am deeply concerned by pub-
lished reports that our Democratic col-
leagues have adopted a ‘‘don’t test, 
don’t tell’’ policy to ensure full attend-
ance today. 
Allegedly, they are more concerned 
about 
ramming 
through 
Senator 
MANCHIN’s tax hike than following CDC 
guidelines to protect not only each 
other but the staff members, the Cap-
itol Police, custodial staff, food service 
workers, and countless others who 
keep this institution running. These 
folks could have any number of other 
health conditions that could lead to 
more severe COVID experiences than, 
for example, I had or they could be 
caregivers for young children or elderly 
relatives who have a high risk of seri-
ous illness. 
I sincerely hope these reports are not 
true. I hope our Democratic colleagues 
are not selfish enough to put so many 
people at risk in order to pass this 
massive tax-and-spending spree. If any 
of our colleagues are experiencing 
COVID symptoms, they should do what 
I did. They should get tested, period. 
We know that as soon as this 
evening, the Senate is expected to vote 
on Senator MANCHIN’s and Senator 
SCHUMER’s massive tax hike on middle- 
class families. You can call it the 
Manchin-Schumer tax hike of 2022. It 
sprung to life, unbeknownst, I believe, 
to virtually all the Democratic Sen-
ators, except for Senator MANCHIN and 
Senator SCHUMER. And no one has seen 
what we will purportedly be voting on 
later today, even our Democratic col-
leagues. No one has seen the final prod-
uct. Once the so-called Byrd bath has

August 6, 2022 
been undertaken by the Parliamen-
tarian, this will be a substitute bill 
that Senator SCHUMER will lay down, 
but nobody has seen it. 
When the senior Senator from West 
Virginia 
announced 
this 
bill 
last 
week—or this agreement—every Re-
publican was shocked and, from my 
view, most Democrats were as well. My 
private conversations with many of my 
Democratic colleagues said: Boy, that 
does not look good to be working so 
closely together on a bipartisan bill 
only to spring this on everybody by 
surprise. It looks like they were trying 
to pull a fast one. After all, Senator 
MANCHIN did put the kibosh on the 
reckless tax-and-spending spree bill 
last year, and he doubled down on his 
opposition just a few weeks ago. 
Privately, his Democratic colleagues 
assured me this was not happening. 
But then the Senator from West Vir-
ginia has engaged in a gigantic Olym-
pic-worthy flip-flop. Senator MANCHIN 
will tell you this bill is completely dif-
ferent from ‘‘Build Back Broke,’’ but it 
is not. 
We should take a look at some of the 
elements of this legislation. ‘‘Build 
Back Broke’’ was a roundup of expen-
sive, unnecessary damaging policies, 
including job-killing tax hikes, which 
would leave hard-working American 
families without a way to earn a pay-
check, Green New Deal climate policies 
that would hurt our energy security 
and drive energy costs through the 
roof, taxpayer subsidies for wealthy 
people 
buying 
expensive 
cars 
and 
SUVs. 
I was listening to the majority whip, 
the Senator from Illinois, talking 
about these businesses that are making 
too much money and so they need to 
pay more in taxes. That is what I have 
come to expect from our Democratic 
colleagues. They are kind of a ‘‘Robin 
Hood’’ party—take from the rich, give 
to the poor. Except here, this is a re-
verse Robin Hood. They are taking 
from middle-class families who can’t 
afford to buy expensive electric vehi-
cles and giving a tax subsidy to 
wealthy people who can afford to buy 
them but are helped with the $7,500 
taxpayer subsidy. So you might call 
that a reverse Robin Hood. 
Then they want to supersize the In-
ternal Revenue Service with even more 
manpower and authority to track ev-
eryday American people and perform, I 
presume, many, many more audits, not 
just on the rich and famous but also on 
middle-class Americans. 
And then there are the special hand-
outs to powerful friends of the Demo-
cratic Party. This isn’t the type of leg-
islation that will bring our economy 
roaring back to life or cool inflation. In 
fact, that is the first place that this 
bill is misrepresented. They are calling 
it the Inflation Reduction Act, but no-
body believes that, in the near term, it 
is going to have a single impact, at all, 
on inflation. 
That is what Penn Wharton said. For 
the next 2 years, they said, it may ac-
tually make inflation worse, but it is a 
negligible amount. But the one thing 
we are sure of is that it sure won’t go 
down. 
So it is not an ‘‘inflation reduction 
act.’’ It is really an insult to the intel-
ligence of the American people to 
think that you can spend this money 
and you can tax individuals and busi-
nesses during a recession—something 
everybody from Bill Clinton to Barack 
Obama, to CHUCK
SCHUMER, to JOE 
MANCHIN has said you don’t do, which 
is raise taxes during a recession—but 
that is exactly what this bill does. 
Higher taxes, bigger government, 
more inflation, and fewer jobs—this is 
a bill whose time has not come. No 
wonder when this bill was originally 
proposed as Build Back Better, Senator 
MANCHIN opposed the bill. 
So let’s see what he and Senator 
SCHUMER wrote in secret behind closed 
doors and then sprung on the American 
people. And, again, we haven’t even 
seen the final product yet, and yet Sen-
ator SCHUMER said we are going to stay 
in session until it passes. 
Well, it is going to have to take all 50 
votes of Democratic Senators and the 
vote of the Vice President to do that, 
because not one single Senator on this 
side of the aisle was consulted, was 
asked to work on a bipartisan basis to 
come up with a product that could be 
supported across the aisle. 
This will be a purely partisan exer-
cise, after I think we have had a pretty 
good run of bipartisan cooperation, and 
I have been proud to be a part of that. 
But this is a complete reversal of sort 
of the spirit of bipartisan cooperation 
that we have seen, frankly, all summer 
long, which has produced some pretty 
good legislation. 
Well, there are tax hikes that will 
leave hard-working Americans poorer. 
Not only will inflation be roughly 9 
percent, which it is today—meaning 
that for every $100 you earn, you are 
only going to get $91 in purchasing 
power—in addition to that, the Joint 
Committee on Taxation said the im-
pact of this bill will mean that individ-
uals earning as little as $10,000 a year 
will see an increase in their tax burden, 
because you can’t spend this much 
money, you can’t tax this many people 
without it having some trickle-down 
effect on taxpayers, certainly those 
who earn less than $400,000, which was 
President Biden’s pledge. And I heard 
the majority leader say that again and, 
I believe, the majority whip, too, but 
this is not true. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation is 
the entity here—nonpartisan entity— 
which provides the final word on those 
issues. So notwithstanding the denials 
of the majority leader and the majority 
whip and others, the Joint Committee 
on Taxation said that taxpayers earn-
ing as little as $10,000 will see their 
taxes go up—maybe not their income 
tax, but they will be poorer as a result 
of this bill. 
Again, part of that is because, in ad-
dition to inflation, in addition to addi-
tional tax burden, you are going to be 
asking them to pay taxes to subsidize 
wealthy people to buy electric vehicles 
or to subsidize people’s health insur-
ance, even though they make well 
above the 400 percent of poverty cap 
that was initially part of ObamaCare, 
the Affordable Care Act. That cap has 
been lifted now as well. 
We will see what the final product 
looks like, but the earlier provision 
showed that people earning up to as 
much as 750 percent of poverty would 
then receive taxpayer subsidies for 
their health insurance. 
Well, Senator MANCHIN and Senator 
SCHUMER may have slapped a new name 
on Build Back Better or ‘‘Build Back 
Broke,’’ but all of the essential ele-
ments are still there: tax hikes on fam-
ilies, the Green New Deal, massive 
electric vehicle subsidies. 
Oh, and here is another thing. A lot 
of the American car manufacturers 
said we may not be able to access these 
tax credits because 70 percent of the 
components that go into electric vehi-
cles are made in other countries, like 
China. That is how slapdash this bill 
was put together. If more time, more 
deliberation, more debate, more bipar-
tisanship had occurred, maybe we 
could have come up with something 
that would make more sense. 
But this is what happens when you 
get in a big hurry. You make mistakes 
and do things that make zero sense, 
like provide this subsidy to a limited 
class of car manufacturers when 70 per-
cent of the components of a typical 
electric vehicle, including the battery, 
come from overseas. 
As I said, this is a misleading-labeled 
bill. It is not going to do a thing to 
ease inflation in the near term. The 
budget experts at Penn Wharton ana-
lyzed Senator MANCHIN’s tax hike and 
bill and completely decimated the ar-
gument that this legislation will re-
duce inflation. If this bill becomes law, 
inflation will not get any better any-
time soon. In fact, I believe Americans 
can expect it to get worse. 
The people at Penn Wharton said the 
Manchin tax hike bill would increase 
inflation slightly in the short term and 
cause it to stick around for 2 more 
years before it would have any impact. 
That is what you are going to tell 
hard-working American families: You 
are being priced out of your favorite 
food and grocery products at the gro-
cery store or you can’t afford to fill up 
your car? Just wait 2 more years. 
Well, if the Democrats are successful 
in passing this bill with purely Demo-
cratic votes, there will be an account-
ing, and there will be a comparison by 
voters in November with, OK, they told 
us that if we pass this bill, it would re-
duce inflation, and let’s see what infla-
tion looks like in November of 2022. 
I am not wishing for higher inflation. 
I hope inflation will go down. But this 
is exactly the opposite of what you 
ought to do if you want to reduce infla-
tion to restore people’s purchasing 
power.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4059 
August 6, 2022 
Well, again, several years ago and 
more recently, our colleague from West 
Virginia said he didn’t think it was 
wise to raise taxes during a recession. 
He and the majority leader have tried 
to convince anyone who will listen, 
who is gullible enough, to believe that 
this bill does not raise taxes on anyone 
making less than $400,000 a year, but, 
as I said, the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation explodes that myth. 
Next year, more than 60 percent of 
taxpayers who earn between $40,000 and 
$50,000 a year will be hit with a higher 
tax bill. That is what the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation said. It is in the so- 
called distributional tables. It is a 
pretty complex calculation, but that is 
why we rely on the Joint Committee 
on Taxation to provide this expert in-
formation and guidance to us, because, 
frankly, it is beyond the capability of 
most of us in Congress. They also said 
that more than 90 percent of those 
earning between $75,000 and $100,000 a 
year will pay more in taxes, and a 
whopping 97 percent of those earning 
between $100,000 and $200,000 will see a 
tax increase. 
I heard our colleague the majority 
whip talk about these big, rich compa-
nies—oil and gas companies, pharma-
ceutical companies—making too much 
money. But these aren’t billion-dollar 
corporations that they are raising 
taxes on; these are middle-class fami-
lies—and for what? To subsidize rich 
people driving around in fancy electric 
vehicles? It is a disgrace. 
Well, of course, working families 
aren’t the only ones who are going to 
face a higher tax bill. The Manchin tax 
hike also hits businesses and is sure to 
have a devastating impact on—guess 
where—West Virginia. I am not making 
this up. Higher taxes require compa-
nies to cut costs everywhere. 
I think sometimes our Democratic 
colleagues have this idea that if you 
raise taxes on businesses, they will 
simply absorb it and they won’t pass it 
along to their customers. That is a 
flight of fantasy. Higher taxes will re-
quire them either to pass those costs 
along or to cut costs elsewhere, like to 
cut off their employees, to not hire as 
many people as they would otherwise 
hire. 
I was flabbergasted, frankly, when I 
saw that, according to the Tax Founda-
tion, the industry that will be hit hard-
est is the coal industry. Now, we know 
the coal industry has been the primary 
target of Democrats’ green policies, 
and maybe that is what they have in 
mind—to put even more coal miners 
out of a job. 
Despite the adverse impact this legis-
lation will have on families and com-
munities across the country, it was 
written 
by 
two 
people: 
Senators 
MANCHIN and SCHUMER. They have been 
working hard since they announced 
their deal, arrived at in secret, behind 
closed doors. They have worked hard to 
try to get this bill to the floor, to see 
if it complies with the Senate rules. 
They continue to make last-minute 
changes—going on even as I speak, 
which is the reason none of us have 
seen the final product—but we are un-
likely to see those final changes before 
Senator SCHUMER asks us to vote on 
the bill. But still Senator SCHUMER 
said he expects every Democrat to fall 
in line and to vote for this legislation 
within a matter of hours. They haven’t 
seen the bill either. I have to imagine 
that Democrats in both the House and 
the Senate are pretty unhappy with 
this process. 
Experts have analyzed this bill and 
said it raises taxes on families, and it 
will have an adverse impact on jobs 
and keep inflation high—certainly not 
cut it—but the top Senate Democrat 
expects his colleagues to ignore these 
warning signs and to vote for it any-
way. 
Like I said, all of us are held ac-
countable by the voters at election 
time. And I guess ultimately that is 
what this exercise will be about—it 
will be about political accountability. 
On average, there have been about 40 
amendments in a so-called vote-arama, 
which we are all familiar with, which 
we will experience presumably later on 
tonight. Our colleagues said: Well, 
there may be some amendments I 
would like to vote for, but I am going 
to vote against them because I want to 
make sure we get this bill across the 
floor, no matter how ugly the process, 
no matter what is in it. 
Well, Democrats have tried and failed 
to convince the American people that 
the biggest problems facing our coun-
try aren’t really problems at all or cer-
tainly their problem. 
Despite all the obvious warnings, the 
Biden administration officials insisted 
that inflation was transitory, that it is 
temporary, won’t last long. Now they 
even want to redefine what it means to 
be in a recession even though we have 
experienced two consecutive quarters 
of negative GDP—gross domestic prod-
uct—growth, which is the textbook def-
inition of a recession. 
People in my State and across the 
country know better than to believe 
this sort of sleight of hand. Despite 
what our colleagues are saying today, 
this bill will increase taxes on families 
earning less than $400,000 a year. It will 
stifle medical and pharmaceutical in-
novation and prevent new lifesaving 
cures from being discovered. It will 
threaten our economy and our energy 
security at a vulnerable moment when 
we are in a recession. 
And it won’t do a darn thing to ease 
the loss of purchasing power due to his-
torically 
high 
inflation 
rates—the 
highest in 40 years—that consumers 
and all Americans are experiencing. It 
won’t do a thing. No amount of spin or 
fast talking can conceal the damage 
this bill will inflict on the American 
people. 
Senator MANCHIN likes to say: ‘‘If I 
can’t go back home and explain it, I 
can’t vote for it,’’ but for the life of 
me, I don’t know how our Democratic 
colleagues are going to explain this one 
in November. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that there be a 
period of morning business for debate 
only until 4 p.m., with Senators per-

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
go back home to Washington State 
every week, and I talk to young people 
in Seattle who are urgently calling for 
bold climate action. I talk to families 
in Yakima County who are deeply con-
cerned by a wildfire season that gets 
worse every year and parents in Van-
couver who are trying to figure out 
how they can afford their kids’ medica-
tion and make ends meet. 
This summer has broken records in 
Washington State and not in a good 
way. Energy prices and temperatures 
have both spiked. People from Seattle 
to Spokane are feeling the stress, and 
they are feeling the heat. Climate dis-
asters have become an everyday reality 
in every community across the coun-
try. 
Washington 
State 
has 
seen 
droughts and wildfires and floods and 
heat waves that literally made our 
roads buckle. 
Families desperately need us to tack-
le rising costs and rising temperatures 
because we cannot build a stronger 
economy if we do not build a more sus-
tainable economy, and that is why we 
need the Inflation Reduction Act. It 
will reduce costs for families, it will re-
duce emissions, and it will even reduce 
the debt and deficit. 
The climate investments in this bill 
are, in a word, historic. They won’t 
just bring down carbon emissions by a 
whopping 40 percent; they will help us 
establish 
real 
energy 
independence 
from dirty fossil fuels and foreign ad-
versaries. They will save lives by re-
ducing air pollution and supporting 
conservation efforts happening in rural 
Washington State right now to prevent 
wildfires and protect families and ad-
dress the climate crisis. 
This legislation will make historic, 
first-of-its-kind, economy-wide invest-
ment in clean energy that will create 
millions of good-paying clean energy 
jobs, including in Washington State, 
and it will bring down families’ energy 
costs for people who are struggling to 
keep the AC on in the summer or the 
heat on in the winter or lights on year- 
round. It will help weatherize homes 
and install energy-efficient appliances 
and heat pumps and rooftop solar pan-
els and more. 
This bill will offer huge cost savings 
for clean or electric vehicles, new or

used, and give companies a good reason 
to build more of these cars in America. 
We aren’t just cutting energy costs, 
though. No one should have to worry 
about whether they can afford the 
healthcare they need, but I have heard 
from countless patients who worked 
their whole life, who saved their 
money, but still had to work an extra 
job or move in with their family or 
even ration their prescription just to 
make ends meet. 
Lifesaving medicine doesn’t do any 
good if people can’t afford it. That is 
why this bill will finally give Medicare 
power to negotiate. We are going to 
force drug companies to the bargaining 
table, and patients everywhere are 
going to benefit. It will also cap sen-
iors’ annual drug costs and cap insulin 
at $35 a month and protect patients 
from companies that are jacking up 
prices on them with reckless abandon. 
It extends the healthcare coverage re-
lief that helped millions of people save 
thousands 
of 
dollars 
on 
their 
healthcare this year. 
This isn’t just saving people money; 
this is going to save lives—patients 
who are rationing their prescriptions, 
afraid to see their doctors not because 
they are scared of getting a diagnosis 
but because they are scared of the price 
tag. If that is not the goal when we 
come to work every day, then I don’t 
know what is. 
But the Inflation Reduction Act 
won’t just bring down families’ every-
day costs; it will bring down the deficit 
by more than $300 billion because every 
cent of this bill is paid for by closing 
loopholes used by enormous corpora-
tions. There is no reason a company 
making a billion-dollar profit should 
pay a smaller tax rate than a mom- 
and-pop shop in Washington State or a 
firefighter or a teacher in Walla Walla, 
WA, so Democrats won’t let it fly any 
longer. 
Those big billion-dollar companies? 
They are going to pay no less than the 
same 15 percent in taxes that many of 
our 
small 
businesses 
already 
pay. 
Those stock buyback schemes that line 
the pockets of corporate executives and 
Wall Street investors but do nothing 
for working families? They are going to 
be taxed so companies pay their fair 
share. As for everyday Americans, they 
won’t see their taxes go up one penny. 
Make no mistake, the Inflation Re-
duction 
Act 
represents 
historic 
progress. There is simply no reason 
anyone should be against these policies 
and many reasons to get this done now. 
This is not a bill for Democrats or 
Republicans; it is legislation that will 
help all Americans—lowering prescrip-
tion drug costs, making healthcare 
more accessible and more affordable 
than ever, and pass the largest invest-
ment in climate action in our coun-
try’s history—all paid for. 
f 
CHILDCARE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
but for everything good this bill ac-
complishes, we have not yet addressed 
a critical issue families face today: ac-
cess to high-quality childcare. 
There is a childcare crisis in this 
country, and the time to address it is 
now. There can be no more excuses. We 
cannot simply vote on this package 
and call it a day. Our childcare system 
isn’t just stretched thin; it is broken. 
Talk to parents, talk to businesses, 
talk to anyone, and it is painfully obvi-
ous that our childcare system isn’t 
working for families, providers, or our 
economy and hasn’t been for some 
time. 
Right now, families from Seattle to 
Spokane are stressed. They are staying 
up late at night, trying to figure out 
how on Earth they are going to find a 
childcare opening or how they are 
going to afford it if they ever get off a 
wait list. When they can’t find and af-
ford childcare, as is all too often the 
case, parents—moms in particular— 
have to leave their job and stay out of 
the workforce, all while childcare 
workers are being paid poverty wages, 
struggling to make ends meet and pro-
vide for their own families, and they 
are leaving their jobs for better paying 
work at fast food chains and big box 
stores, which pay them more than 
their childcare position. 
We have to do better for kids, for 
moms, for workers, for our economy, 
for everyone, or this is just going to 
keep getting worse. 
I know all of my colleagues have 
heard me say this before—you have 
probably heard me say it 100 times— 
but I want to be clear: The childcare 
system is on the brink of collapse, and 
parents are telling us every single day 
this is an urgent crisis. 
The emergency support that we did 
provide in the American Rescue Plan 
was hugely helpful, but it is going to 
run out, and soon, and families who are 
already at their wits’ end will feel the 
pressure. 
So we need to lower the cost for fam-
ilies as we fight inflation. We need to 
expand parents’ options so they can go 
back to work and support the childcare 
workers caring for and educating our 
kids each and every day. Now, I have 
been putting forward proposal after 
proposal to do exactly this, and I am 
working with anyone I can to make 
progress here because this isn’t a ‘‘my 
way or the highway’’ proposal. It never 
was. I hope my colleagues know that is 
not how I operate. What I am talking 
about here is delivering a lifeline to 
kids, to moms, to our childcare indus-
try, not to mention the businesses and 
industries that desperately want to 
hire more workers. 
I am deeply disappointed that Con-
gress has failed to meet this crucial 
moment for our families and our 
childcare providers, so let me just say 
this: I have been fighting for childcare 
my entire career, since before I ever 
got here to the U.S. Senate. In fact, for 
a very long time, I was the only person 
in the room fighting. So I am not going 
to stop anytime soon. 
And guess what. I am not the only 
one fighting today. There are parents 
and advocates across the country who 
are fighting for this, who know how 
critical this is for our families. There 
are small business owners who under-
stand how critical this is to strength-
ening our economy—real people, not 
some army of invisible lobbyists. So I 
am here right now to be a voice for 
them, and I am asking everyone here in 
Congress to step up and speak for these 
families too. We have to get this done. 
We must make this a priority. We must 
address this urgent crisis before it is 
too late. 
So I want everyone to know I am 
going to stay in this fight for moms 
and for our kids, and you better be-
lieve, one day, we are going to win this. 
I yield the floor.

CHILDCARE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
well, first, I want to thank my dear 
friend and our great leader and chair of 
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee for her positive words 
on this bill and her reminder to all of 
us that our work is not done and par-
ticularly for her work on one of the 
most urgent issues facing American 
families: childcare. I don’t know of a 
single Member of this Senate, Demo-
crat or Republican, who has done more 
to push the issue of childcare and get it 
done than the senior Senator from the 
great State of Washington, and I thank 
her for that. 
I want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ator KAINE and Senator BLUMENTHAL, 
who have also been such strong leaders 
on this issue. 
I am here to say that what they are 
saying—Senator 
MURRAY, 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, Senator KAINE—is right. 
We need to do something in this coun-
try to lower childcare costs and in-
crease its availability. I pledge to my 
colleagues and to the American people 
that I will keep working with Senator 
MURRAY until we get something done 
to increase access to high-quality 
childcare for working families. 
We all know that, today, families pay 
more for childcare than at any point in 
American history. Amazingly, some-
times families have to pay more for 
childcare than they would pay for a 
mortgage. It is out of reach. 
Some people forget how the world 
has changed. When I was a kid, my dad 
had this little junky exterminating 
business. My mom was what was then 
called a housewife. I got home from 
school every day at 3 o’clock, and there 
was Mom with milk and cookies, ask-
ing me what homework I had—oh, I 
don’t have any homework, Mom—and 
telling me what time I had to come 
back home from going out and playing 
in the schoolyard for dinner. 
That doesn’t happen anymore. The 
vast majority of families in America 
are either single parent or two parents,

both working. The percentage that 
have two parents, only one working, is 
minimal. So childcare is now a neces-
sity. It is a necessity for families. 
The anguish people go through to try 
to find childcare, and then when it is 
not available or something happens, 
what are they going to do? They are 
both working and scrambling. Who is 
going to watch the kids? It is agony. It 
is not this kind of agony that comes, 
you know, God forbid, once in a life-
time when you get a serious illness, 
but it is real agony and anxiety. We 
have to do something. 
There is another reason we have to 
do something: our economy. You read 
all of the economic experts. We are 
short of labor. We are short of labor. 
You go to any business—small, me-
dium, big—they are short of labor. 
Probably the No. 1 or No. 2 reason in 
the whole country we are short of labor 
is we don’t have adequate childcare. 
Moms or dads don’t want to go to work 
because they don’t know who is going 
to take care of the kids. Moms or dads 
stay home or retire or whatever. So 
our economy desperately needs this. 
When parents can’t enter the work-
force—particularly women—our coun-
try suffers as an economy, and produc-
tivity is greatly diminished. 
Of course, there are other issues to 
deal with in this economy as well that 
are related. Home- and community- 
based services. People need a roof over 
their heads. We need to support fami-
lies through paid leave. We need to 
make sure that every child in this 
country has a chance to grow and reach 
their potential, not in poverty. All of 
these issues are important. Childcare is 
so important—so important. 
So I want to first thank again Sen-
ator MURRAY for her words. I want to 
thank my colleagues. Two of our lead-
ers on this issue, Senators KAINE and 
BLUMENTHAL, are here today. 
We want to pledge to the American 
people that we are going to keep work-
ing until we get something done in 
childcare, and we will keep fighting for 
all these issues to expand opportunity 
for all Americans. It is so, so vital to 
the future of our country and to the 
well-being of families across the Na-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
f 
CHILDCARE 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am 
so pleased to be on the floor today to 
join with Senator MURRAY, Senator 
SCHUMER, and Senator BLUMENTHAL to 
talk about the critical importance of 
childcare. 
I will speak in about 40 minutes 
about a piece of this bill, the black 
lung program, which is really impor-
tant to the State of Virginia, but, like 
Senator MURRAY, I share a sadness that 
childcare is not included in this bill be-
cause this is what I am hearing from 
Virginians: Even before the pandemic, 
there was an inadequate supply. People 
working in this field weren’t being paid 
enough. Parents are having to pay too 
much. 
It is a market failure, and we have to 
fix it. This bill doesn’t, and so we will 
need to continue it. 
There has never been anyone in the 
history of the U.S. Senate who has 
been as passionate an advocate for 
childcare as the senior Senator from 
Washington, Senator MURRAY. She sort 
of swallowed a lead, because she is a 
modest person, when she said: I cared 
about this from before I got here. 
Her colleagues know and Washing-
tonians know, but all Americans might 
not know, that Senator MURRAY was an 
early childhood educator before she 
came to the U.S. Senate. So this is a 
passion that drove her career before 
she was here, and she hasn’t left it be-
hind, not for one second. So when she 
says she is going to stay on this until 
it gets done, she will. 
I am very, very pleased to be a HELP 
Committee member under her leader-
ship and to help her on this, and I have 
a personal interest in this too. I have 
three children. My middle son, Lin, 
went to Carleton College, Phi Beta 
Kappa graduate, and he works as a pre- 
K classroom aide in Minneapolis. This 
is how he has chosen to make a dif-
ference in the world around him, by 
working as a classroom aide in a pre-
kindergarten program. And I know 
from my discussions with my son, who 
just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago, 
how important the work is and how 
poorly paid it is, and how parents 
struggle even to afford sending kids to 
a childcare program, where the work-
ers don’t get paid very much. 
So this really is a classic market 
failure, and I think about Lin as I ad-
vocate for this. And I also had a chance 
to think anew, Senator MURRAY, about 
the importance of a priority. 
A good news story the other day was 
that the American unemployment rate 
is the lowest that it has ever been in 50 
years at 3.5 percent, and we all are 
hearing employers saying: But I can’t 
hire people. I can’t hire people. 
There are millions of Americans who 
could be in the workforce, filling up 
these jobs that employers are looking 
to fill, but are not in the workforce be-
cause of a lack of affordable childcare. 
So it is important for kids, it is impor-
tant for families’ pocketbooks, and it 
is important for the providers them-
selves. But our economy does not work 
in the way that it should if we don’t 
have affordable childcare options. So I 
pledge to work together with my chair 
on this issue until we get it done.

TRIBUTE TO KARISHMA 
MERCHANT 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, the 
last thing I want to say is a thank-you. 
I have a staffer in the room, Karishma 
Merchant, who has staffed me on the 
HELP Committee since before I was on 
the HELP Committee, and she is leav-
ing me to take a wonderful job at Jobs 
for the Future to continue her passion 
for workforce and education. 
She has helped me on childcare, on 
issues battling campus sexual assault, 
career and technical education, and 
teacher training. Everything I have 
done in the education and workforce 
space and on the committee has been 
because I had a fantastic staffer point-
ing me in the right direction. She is 
here in the Chamber, and I want to fin-
ish by expressing my thanks to her. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Connecticut. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I am so proud to be here today to 
speak in favor of the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act, which hopefully we are on the 
cusp of passing. 
It is historic. We will save lives, save 
money, save taxpayers. It will lower 
costs for all Americans in healthcare, 
particularly prescription drugs. It is 
the most important action to cut medi-
cine costs in our history—certainly, in 
recent history. It is the most signifi-
cant tax fairness measure in recent his-
tory, and it is the largest investment 
and most important action to fight cli-
mate change in our history. So it is a 
big deal, and it will be measurable for 
all Americans in what they pay to keep 
themselves healthy, to keep the planet 
inhabitable, to keep the highest in-
come people from avoiding or evading 
taxes, and, in so many ways, it will 
make a difference in people’s lives. 
But it is a compromise, like many 
measures that we have passed that 
have accomplished very significant im-
provements in people’s lives. It is an 
agreement where some people get some 
of what they want and others don’t get 
what they want. And one point where I 
think a number of us wanted to ad-
vance was the cause of childcare, and 
we see an absence. 
But listening to Senator SCHUMER, 
especially, I am more confident than 
ever that we will fight and win more 
aid for childcare, and Senator MURRAY 
and Senator KAINE have spoken so elo-
quently. I will simply say to what they 
said that I agree whole-heartedly be-
cause childcare is critical to kids. It is 
essential to early development, edu-
cation, and physical and mental well- 
being. 
It is essential for families because 
they need it to go back to work, par-
ticularly moms who have been out of 
the workforce. It is essential to our 
economy 
because 
employers—big, 
small—all need more workers, and they 
need to train those workers, and the 
way to find those workers and give 
them the skills they need to fill those 
jobs is to enable them to be secure in 
knowing 
their 
children 
have 
good 
childcare. 
It is important to the men and 
women who form the childcare work-
force. I have been all around the State

of Connecticut—to Torrington, Hart-
ford, Bristol. In fact, I accompanied the 
President of the United States to visit 
one of Connecticut’s childcare facili-
ties. They do great work. They have 
been doing great work during the pan-
demic, reporting for duty, taking care 
of children, even as their industry was 
impacted by smaller amounts of chil-
dren being able to go there because 
parents had smaller amounts of income 
to afford it. And the fact of the matter 
is, in Connecticut, the yearly cost of 
childcare is about $20,000. We have lost 
a major part of our childcare work-
force, and this measure is essential to 
those men and women who take care of 
kids in those childcare facilities with 
their 
courage 
and 
diligence 
and 
strength that befits the enormous re-
sponsibility that they have. 
We are determined to make childcare 
affordable and accessible for every 
American family. The proposal that no 
more than 7 percent of any family’s in-
come be required for childcare is one 
that I still think makes eminent good 
sense. 
We need to recognize that childcare 
facilities need to be sustained and sup-
ported, and those families need that 
same support and resource. 
So I am absolutely determined that 
we will move forward on childcare. As 
frustrated as I may be that this great 
compromise we see in the Inflation Re-
duction Act fails to include it, I am 
proud to support it and vote for it, and 
to continue this fight which we can and 
will win. And I thank my colleagues 
who will be joining us for their support 
as well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we 
are somehow continuing to consider 
the Democrats’ grab bag of bad ideas, 
otherwise 
known—I 
would 
say, 
misleadingly—as the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act. 
Let’s start with the bill’s title. It 
gets you feeling somewhat hopeful, 
doesn’t it? The Inflation Reduction Act 
sounds like a bill that is going to ad-
dress perhaps the No. 1 problem facing 
our Nation—inflation. Then you actu-
ally look at the bill’s contents and dis-
cover that the bill will do nothing to 
reduce inflation—nothing. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. Here is what the nonpartisan 
Penn Wharton Budget Model had to say 
about the bill’s impact on inflation: 
‘‘The impact on inflation is statis-
tically indistinguishable from zero’’— 
‘‘statistically indistinguishable from 
zero.’’ 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-
et Office also found that the bill would 
do nothing to address our current infla-
tion crisis. So did the Tax Foundation. 
So much for inflation reduction. 
So what about the deficit reduction 
the Democrats are touting? Well, un-
fortunately, there is a good chance 
there won’t be much of that either. 
Democrats rely on some very shady ac-
counting to reach their supposed def-
icit reduction number—most notably 
from the repeal of a rule that has never 
been implemented and, at this point, 
was never expected to be. 
No matter what this rule was pre-
dicted to cost, if it was never going to 
be implemented, its cost was effec-
tively zero. So repealing this rule 
leaves you with exactly zero—zero dol-
lars to spend, not $120 billion. 
Then there is the question of the 
bill’s expanded ObamaCare subsidies. 
The Democrats’ bill extends the ex-
panded 
ObamaCare 
subsidies 
by 
3 
years. But it is common knowledge 
that the Democrats want to extend 
them permanently, as the President ex-
plicitly said in his State of the Union 
Address. And when you figure in the 
cost of extending them permanently, 
most of the purported cost savings in 
the bill, which the Democrats claim 
will go toward deficit reduction, dwin-
dle away. 
So no deficit reduction, an extremely 
doubtful amount of deficit reduction— 
what else? Well, there are the hundreds 
of billions of dollars in tax hikes. Yes, 
hundreds of billions of dollars in tax 
hikes. Our economy has posted two 
consecutive 
quarters 
of 
negative 
growth. In fact, by any common defini-
tion, we are now in a recession. And 
Democrats think now is a good time to 
hike taxes on businesses—businesses 
that are already struggling with 40- 
year high inflation? 
The Democrats’ book minimum tax, 
as proposed last week, would be a $313 
billion tax hike, with roughly half of 
the increase falling on American man-
ufacturers. 
I don’t think I need to tell anyone 
what happens when you raise taxes on 
businesses, particularly when the econ-
omy is shrinking. You get less growth, 
lower wages, and fewer jobs. 
According to an analysis from the 
National Association of Manufacturers, 
in 2023 alone, the version of the bill 
Democrats introduced last week would 
reduce real gross domestic product by 
more than $68 billion and result in 
more than 218,000 fewer workers in the 
overall economy. 
The Tax Foundation also found that 
the bill would, unsurprisingly, reduce 
economic growth, reduce wages, and re-
duce jobs. In short, a big part of the 
burden of the Democrats’ tax hike on 
businesses would fall on American fam-
ilies and American workers. 
And the book minimum tax on Amer-
ican businesses is not the only tax hike 
Democrats are proposing on this bill. 
They just purportedly replaced a $14 
billion tax hike on investment with a 
new $74 billion stock buyback tax de-
signed to punish investors who choose 
to keep their own money invested in a 
business—a tax hike that will likely 
discourage new investment and have a 
negative impact on Americans’ retire-
ment savings. 
And, of course, they have included a 
number of taxes and fees on oil and gas 
production. I guess Democrats would 
like our current sky-high energy prices 
to continue long-term, because I am at 
a loss for any other reason why Demo-
crats would choose to hike taxes on oil 
and gas production at a time when 
Americans are already struggling with 
high gas prices and high utility bills. 
The Democrats didn’t always think 
raising taxes during a recession was a 
good idea. In fact, President Obama 
once said: 
[T]he last thing you want to do is to raise 
taxes in the middle of a recession. 
That was from President Obama. 
As the current Democratic leader 
once said: 
You don’t want to take money out of the 
economy when the economy is shrinking. 
Well, unfortunately, now that their 
Green New Deal fantasies are on the 
line, the Democrats have changed their 
tune. That is right. Democrats are hik-
ing taxes during a recession not to ad-
dress our border crisis or inflation or 
rising crime but so that they can im-
plement their Green New Deal agenda. 
Their so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act is chock-full of Green New Deal 
spending, things like $1.5 billion—bil-
lion dollars—for a grant program to 
plant trees; $1 billion for electric, 
heavy-duty 
vehicles 
like 
garbage 
trucks, which is something that com-
munities used to normally provide for; 
$3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to 
purchase zero-emissions delivery vehi-
cles; and $1.9 billion for things like 
road equity and identifying gaps in 
tree canopy coverage. 
Yes, the Democrats are apparently 
willing to send us into a longer term 
recession—or stagflation—in order to 
provide billions of dollars for things 
like road equity and identifying gaps in 
tree canopy coverage. 
All told, the Democrats provide more 
than $60 billion in this bill for ‘‘envi-
ronmental justice’’—$60 billion. Now, 
to put that number in perspective, that 
is more than the Federal Government 
spent on highways in 2019. 
The bill also contains at least $30 bil-
lion in climate slush funds, part of 
which is allocated for, among other 
things, climate-related political activ-
ity—yes, climate-related political ac-
tivity—because, for sure, there is noth-
ing more that families who are strug-
gling with ballooning grocery bills and 
the high price of gas are eager to see 
their tax dollars going toward than 
Green New Deal activism. Apparently, 
it is a very high priority for Demo-
crats, but I would say, in all likelihood, 
not for the American people and Amer-
ican families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4063 
August 6, 2022 
I haven’t even talked about the tax 
credits and rebates the Democrats’ bill 
will provide for wealthy Americans 
who purchase new electric vehicles or 
who remodel their kitchens with Dem-
ocrat-approved green appliances. 
Well, I could go on for a while here. 
It is difficult, really, honestly, to 
squeeze all of the bad ideas in the 
Democrats’ bill into just one floor 
speech, and I haven’t mentioned the so-
cialist-style price controls that the 
Democrats’ bill would pose on prescrip-
tion drugs—price controls that would 
result in fewer new drugs and treat-
ments—or the additional $80 billion— 
yes, $80 billion—that the Democrats’ 
bill would give to the IRS, with the 
majority of it being used to boost IRS 
audits. 
Now, of that $80 billion, $45 billion of 
it would go to IRS enforcement—$45 
billion, or 57 percent. Do you want to 
know how much of that $80 billion 
would go to taxpayer services? Four 
percent. Four percent—that for an 
Agency that only succeeded in answer-
ing about 1 out of every 50 taxpayers’ 
phone calls during the 2021 tax season. 
There is $80 billion to the IRS for an 
additional 87,000 employees—87,000 new 
employees at an Agency that, I am 
told, only has about 53 percent of its 
workforce actually going back to the 
office—87,000 employees. You are going 
to have tax agents moving in with fam-
ilies around this country. 
The Democrats aren’t focused on im-
proving taxpayer services but on boost-
ing the number of IRS audits. No one 
should be deceived into thinking these 
increased audits will fall solely on mil-
lionaires and billionaires. No matter 
what the Democrats and some officials 
at the IRS conveniently claim, the fact 
of the matter is that it is exceedingly 
unlikely the Democrats will be able to 
collect the revenue they want to col-
lect from increased IRS enforcement 
without auditing small businesses and 
ordinary taxpayers. In fact, based on 
data from the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation, somewhere between 78 to 90 per-
cent of the revenue that is projected to 
be raised from underreported income 
would likely come from those making 
under $200,000 a year. 
So 87,000 new IRS agents are sent out 
with the purpose of collecting more 
revenue, allegedly, according to the 
Democrats, 
from 
high-income 
tax-
payers and businesses that are escaping 
taxation; yet the Joint Committee on 
Taxation finds that 78 to 90 percent of 
the revenue projected to be raised from 
underreported 
income 
would 
likely 
come from those making under $200,000 
a year. 
Almost 18 months ago now, the 
Democrats passed a massive, partisan 
$1.9 trillion spending spree, which 
fueled inflation—record inflation—that 
Americans are still struggling with in 
this country. By the way, that $1.9 tril-
lion spending spree was all on the 
debt—all on the debt. They didn’t at-
tempt to pay for it; they just put it on 
the debt. 
So now, to talk about possibly reduc-
ing the deficit by what I think, when it 
is all said and done, in this bill will be 
under $100 billion, that will assume all 
kinds of things like actually they are 
going to raise revenue from these 87,000 
new agents whom they are going to 
hire at the IRS to audit American tax-
payers. It also assumes things like the 
ObamaCare premium subsidies are only 
going to be limited to a 3-year exten-
sion rather than a full 10 years, which 
we all know is ultimately going to hap-
pen. 
In the end, I believe there will be zero 
deficit reduction, but the fact of the 
matter is that that piece of legislation, 
in addition to fueling inflation and 
adding to the debt—and having learned 
from that experience, I would hope you 
would think that the Democrats here 
would not double down with yet an-
other terrible economic idea, which is 
another tax-and-spending spree. Like 
the so-called American Rescue Plan be-
fore it, it will leave our economy and 
the American people worse off. 
For their sake, I hope the Democrats 
will think better of this bill before it is 
too late. We are going to have an op-
portunity to debate it here, probably in 
a few hours, and will have an oppor-
tunity to vote on lots of amendments, 
and we will see what that process 
yields. 
I can tell you one thing: The Amer-
ican people are tired of 40-year high in-
flation; they are tired of higher energy 
prices; they are tired of higher food 
prices; and they are concerned about 
an economy that is in recession. They 
are looking at a Democrat leadership 
in Washington, DC, that has as its No. 
1 goal—out of all of the things you 
could do to attack inflation, attack 
high energy costs, to deal with a bro-
ken border, crime in our cities, and to 
deal with a wobbly economy, their pre-
scription, as always, is the same thing 
no matter what the problem is; that is, 
to raise taxes, increase spending, and 
grow government—all at the expense of 
the American people. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Delaware. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise this afternoon to speak in support 
of the historic legislation we are con-
sidering today, the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022. 
A little over a week ago, when I 
heard the news that there was an 
agreement reached to move forward on 
this legislation, I could not help but 
feel an overwhelming sense of relief 
and of joy, and I am not alone in feel-
ing that way. I felt relief in knowing 
that, after months of negotiations and 
years of hard work from volunteers, 
from activists, from policy experts, 
from leaders at all levels of govern-
ment and industry, and from so many 
others, we had finally broken the log-
jam on major climate and clean energy 
legislation. I felt joy in knowing that 
we were one step closer to delivering a 
major victory for the American people, 
one that will help reduce inflation and 
create good-paying jobs at the same 
time. My belief is that this legislation 
is an answer to our prayers for a 
brighter future for our Nation and for 
our planet. 
I might say to all of these young peo-
ple who are sitting up here—we have a 
bunch of our pages who are here from 
all over the country; they are, for the 
most part, rising juniors and seniors— 
that they remind me a lot of our grand-
children, frankly, in my family and, for 
folks, of a lot of their children. 
This is for you. This is for your gen-
eration. 
This is for our kids, our grand-
children, our nieces, our nephews. 
This is for you. 
After enduring a deadly global pan-
demic for the last 2 years and the re-
sulting political and economic turbu-
lence flowing from it, the truth is that 
far too many Americans are struggling. 
They are hurting from the high cost of 
healthcare; they are hurting from ris-
ing living expenses and energy bills; 
and they are hurting from extreme 
weather that is costing us in terms of 
dollars and of lives. 
I know this because that is what I 
hear when I travel home to Delaware 
almost every night. I don’t live here; I 
live in Delaware. I go back and forth on 
a train—a lot like a guy named Biden 
used to do when he was a mere Sen-
ator, along with Senator CHRIS COONS 
and LISA
BLUNT
ROCHESTER, a Con-
gresswoman. Whether it is a senior on 
a fixed income who is struggling with 
the cost of lifesaving prescription 
drugs or a young person who is living 
in a community that is prone to flood-
ing from rising sea levels, many Dela-
wareans of all ages are anxious about 
their futures, and they are pleading 
with us to do something about it. 
Scientists are also pleading with us 
for action, too, before it is too late. For 
years, they have warned us that time is 
running out, that we must shift away 
from fossil fuels to avoid a future of 
unrelenting extreme weather. Now sci-
entists are telling us it is code red for 
humanity and for our planet. 
We are already experiencing a cli-
mate crisis, and Americans from com-
munities large and small are feeling its 
impact, most notably in the form of ex-
treme heat, wildfires, and floods. 
As I speak here today, nearly 100 mil-
lion Americans from Texas to Maine 
are under heat advisories—100 million. 
There are also more than 50 wildfires 
raging across the West, burning tens of 
thousands of acres in States like Cali-
fornia and Montana and Idaho and 
Alaska. Just last week, catastrophic 
flash floods in Eastern Kentucky, not 
far from where my mom spent the last 
years of her life, have tragically 
claimed some 37 lives. 
We know that these deadly, extreme 
weather events will only get worse in

the years ahead without coordinated 
action—without coordinated action— 
and we know that the most vulnerable 
among us, including many commu-
nities of color, will suffer the most if 
we fail to act. 
The best science available tells us 
that to avoid the worst impacts of 
global warming, we must achieve some-
thing that is referred to as ‘‘net zero 
carbon emissions’’ no later than the 
year 2050. Achieving this ambitious 
goal will not be easy, but it is achiev-
able. 
As some of my colleagues will tell 
you, I am by nature an optimist. I al-
ways have been. Out of great adversity 
comes great opportunity. Those are the 
words of Albert Einstein. In adversity 
lies opportunity. There is huge adver-
sity here but also great opportunity. 
I am proud to say that we are on the 
precipice of passing legislation that 
will channel American ingenuity to ad-
dress this crisis, lower costs for fami-
lies, and fight inflation. How will they 
do all of that? The Inflation Reduction 
Act includes nearly $370 billion in fund-
ing for climate and clean energy provi-
sions. In other words, it will be the 
most ambitious climate legislation to 
ever emerge from this body. It does so 
by not raising taxes on people whose 
incomes are under $400,000, on families 
whose incomes are under $400,000, and 
it does so in a way that is not infla-
tionary and that is fully paid for and 
offset. 
What will the impact be of this trans-
formational climate legislation? Well, 
according to an analysis from Energy 
Innovation—some the smartest people 
here in this country who work on 
issues like this—according to their 
analysis, passing this legislation will 
reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 
a little bit over 40 percent by 2030. And 
as President Biden might say, that is a 
very big deal. He might say it dif-
ferently but something along those 
lines. 
This legislation will, along with ac-
tion from executive Agencies and State 
and local actors, will put us within 
reach of meeting our national target of 
cutting emissions in half by the end of 
this decade. 
In addition to slashing emissions 
from across our economy, this legisla-
tion will also unleash the potential of 
the American clean energy industry 
and create good-paying jobs through-
out our country. In fact, it will create 
a ton of jobs. The analysis from the Po-
litical Economy Research Institute at 
the University of Massachusetts Am-
herst projects that the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act—this legislation that we are 
debating—will help create 9 million 
jobs over the next decade—9 million 
over the next decade. 
And the benefits to this historic 
package aren’t just limited to emission 
reductions and to job creation. As its 
name suggests, this legislation will 
fight inflation and lower costs for 
many Americans. Again, ask: How? 
For starters, the Inflation Reduction 
Act will help homeowners save up to 
$220 a year on electricity costs, accord-
ing to an analysis by the Resources for 
the Future. 
This legislation also includes huge 
healthcare savings for families across 
our country. For example, on average, 
median-income families in Delaware 
with exchange-based care will save up-
ward of $1,000 annually. That is $1,000 
back in their pockets. 
This bill will also ensure that our 
seniors don’t face financial ruin paying 
for lifesaving prescription drugs. It 
does so, in part, by capping patients’ 
out-of-pocket costs in the Medicare 
Part D Program at $2,000 per year. 
And the Inflation Reduction Act will 
help strengthen our tax system to bet-
ter ensure that everyone pays their fair 
share and also to ensure that we have 
got decent constituent services for our 
constituents in our States. I don’t care 
whether it is Minnesota, I don’t care 
whether it is Delaware, or some other 
place, the IRS just hasn’t had the re-
sources, the people, the technology, to 
actually provide good constituent serv-
ices. We are still waiting for people to 
get their returns from last year and 
their refunds from last year. That is 
just totally unacceptable. And over the 
last probably 30, 40 years, we have re-
duced by roughly a quarter the amount 
of resources that are available to actu-
ally serve people through the IRS. 
At the end of the day, the programs 
in this bill will help create jobs, lower 
costs for many American families, and 
fight inflation, all while addressing the 
imminent threat of climate change and 
doing so in a way that leaves no com-
munity behind. It is proof that we can 
do well and do good at the same time. 
As chairman of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, I am espe-
cially proud that our $41 billion title 
within the purview of our committee 
prioritizes climate action in low-in-
come and disadvantaged communities. 
This is part of ensuring that all com-
munities, especially those most suscep-
tible to the negative impacts of cli-
mate change, benefit from our funding 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
reduce air pollution where they live— 
where they live. 
As part of that commitment, we pro-
vide $27 billion for the Environmental 
Protection Agency to create a green-
house gas reduction fund, known as the 
Green Bank. It will help leverage pri-
vate investments in projects that com-
bat climate change, with over 40 per-
cent of these investments going to un-
derserved communities. The climate 
impact of this program will be huge, 
removing the equivalent of some 15 
million gasoline-powered vehicles from 
our roads over the next decade. 
We also provide $3 billion in competi-
tive grants to States, Tribes, and mu-
nicipalities—and to community-based 
nonprofit organizations—for financial 
and technical assistance to address 
clean air and to eliminate pollution in 
environmental justice communities. 
Our EPW title also provides some $3 
billion to help reduce carbon emissions 
flowing from our Nation’s ports. Doing 
so not only cleans up the air in nearby 
communities but also reduces our reli-
ance on foreign fuels. And we provide 
$1 billion to replace dirty medium and 
heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emitting 
vehicles on our roads, reducing fuel 
consumption while allowing businesses 
that run those trucks to save signifi-
cantly on their energy costs. 
While I wish I could discuss this 
afternoon every program in our title of 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, let me just close by shar-
ing a few words on one program I am 
particularly proud of, our first-ever 
Methane Emission Reduction Program 
to rein in excess methane pollution 
from the oil and gas industry. 
Why did we create a program to re-
duce methane emissions? Why was this 
so important? Well, let me tell you 
this: Methane is more than 80 times 
more potent than carbon dioxide as a 
greenhouse gas. I will say that again. 
Methane is more than 80 times more 
potent than carbon dioxide as a green-
house. 
There was a guy who used to be a 
bank robber named Willie Sutton back 
in the Great Depression. My friend 
from Iowa probably remembers Willie 
Sutton, not personally. But Willie Sut-
ton robbed a lot of banks back in those 
days. He finally got caught and was 
brought to trial. And standing before 
the judge, the judge said: Mr. Sutton, 
why do you rob banks? 
Willie Sutton responded famously: 
That is where the money is, judge; that 
is where the money is. 
Well, there are huge emissions—huge 
emissions—that flow from methane. 
They ought to be captured; they can be 
captured, and the programs that we 
offer here, the funding we offer here, 
will help that to happen. 
We designed this commonsense pro-
gram to provide $11⁄2 billion to help 
businesses invest in existing tech-
nology to reduce potent methane emis-
sions. It then ramps up a fee over time 
for emitters that fail to take advan-
tage of this assistance. All told, we ex-
pect this program to raise about $61⁄2 
billion—that is billion with a ‘‘b’’—to 
offset the costs of other climate and 
environmental justice investments in 
the title of our committee’s bill. 
Years from now—years from now— 
folks are going to gather here in this 
Chamber, and they will look back at 
what we had before us, what we were 
confronted with, and whether or not we 
made a difference. I hope they will 
judge us favorably. 
Let me just say, in closing, 2 weeks 
ago, they reported in London, England, 
a temperature of 105 degrees. For those 
of us who have been to England, you 
may know this: They don’t even have 
air-conditioning in most places in Eng-
land. The temperature there, 105 de-
grees. In the same week that the tem-
perature was 105 degrees, folks were 
trying to run the bicycle event, the 
French bicycle event that is so famous, 
and they could not run parts of it be-
cause the pavement was melting. They

had to put tens of thousands of gallons 
of water on the roads just so they could 
run the French bicycle race. 
I will close with this: In Louisiana, 
they have problems, they have chal-
lenges from sea level rise. How serious 
are they? Well, every 100 minutes in 
Louisiana, they lose a piece of land to 
the ocean from sea level rise. Every 100 
minutes they lose a piece of land the 
size of a football field. And today, this 
week, we are seeing incredible heat, in-
credible drought. From the west coast 
to the east coast, people are suffering, 
suffering, in some cases, injury and 
death. We have got to do something 
about it, and we are going to do that 
with this legislation and also make 
sure that a lot of folks who need jobs in 
the years to come will have a good-pay-
ing job. That is not a bad day’s work. 
With that, I am pleased to take this 
piece of paper and read it to my col-
leagues, including the Senator from 
Iowa, who is waiting patiently for me 
to stop talking.

mitted to speak therein for up to 10

MER be recognized at 4:15 p.m.

HEALTHCARE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this body has a long record of coming 
together to improve healthcare for 
Americans. 
In 2003, when I was chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, we worked 
in a bipartisan manner to establish the 
Medicare Part D benefit. More re-
cently, I have worked with my col-
leagues on the Finance Committee on 
oversight and investigations to hold 
EpiPen 
manufacturers 
accountable 
that were misusing taxpayer dollars 
and insulin manufacturers and PBMs 
accountable that were unfairly increas-
ing the list price of insulin. We can 
work together and meaningfully im-
prove healthcare. 
This Congress, I have worked with 
my Democratic colleagues to pass five 
of my bills out of committee in a bipar-
tisan way. These bills will lower drug 
prices, create more competition, while 
holding Big Pharma and PBMs ac-
countable. Unfortunately, the leader 
hasn’t brought any of these bills up for 
a vote, even though they would easily 
pass the U.S. Senate. 
But this hasn’t stopped me from try-
ing to find other ways to help bring 
down the cost of medications. 
In 2019, as Finance Committee chair-
man, I began a bipartisan committee 
process with the ranking member from 
Oregon to lower the costs of prescrip-
tion drugs. That bill is entitled the 
‘‘Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act.’’ 
We held three committee hearings to 
learn from policymakers and advo-
cates, while also holding Big Pharma 
and PBMs accountable. We held a com-
mittee markup, where the bill passed 
19 to 9 on a bipartisan basis. We contin-
ued to hold additional negotiations to 
make improvements in the bill, even 
after it got out of committee. It con-
tained stuff that I like. It also con-
tained stuff I didn’t like, but that is 
the way we do bipartisan legislating. 
Today, it is still the only comprehen-
sive prescription drug bill that can gar-
ner more than 60 votes on the Senate 
floor. 
I recently outlined on the floor the 
bill’s details in case the majority party 
has forgotten. I won’t restate every 
part of my July 20 speech, but here are 
some of the bill’s key highlights: 
One, it lowers costs for seniors by $72 
billion and saves the taxpayers $95 bil-
lion. 
Two, it establishes an out-of-pocket 
cap, eliminates the doughnut hole, and 
redesigns Medicare Part D. 
Three, it ends taxpayer subsidies to 
Big Pharma by capping price increases 
of Medicare Part B and D drugs at in-
flation. 
Four, it establishes accountability 
and 
transparency 
in 
the 
pharma-
ceutical industry. 
Five, and most important in this 
body, the bill is bipartisan. 
Now, believe it or not, a bipartisan 
bill limiting pharmaceutical increases 
is possible. Compare this to what the 
majority has offered us. Their partisan 
bill includes more reckless spending 
and tax increases. Their partisan bill 
reduces the number of new cures and 
treatments. Their partisan bill fails to 
enact any bipartisan accountability for 
Big Pharma and, in particular, for 
PBMs. 
Even while the majority party has 
decided to pursue a purely partisan bill 
in secret over the past 20 months, I 
have continued to meet with Demo-
crats and Republicans to advance a bi-
partisan and negotiated bill. I would 
prefer a bipartisan bill to pass the U.S. 
Senate. 
We could still pass the Prescription 
Drug Pricing Reduction Act. My col-
leagues know it. Several of them have 
thanked me publicly on my bipartisan 
work to lower prescription drug prices. 
Sadly, the majority party has chosen a 
different route. 
They have chosen a bill that contains 
zero—zero—PBM 
accountability. 
It 
gives middlemen a pass. They have 
chosen a bill that contains none of the 
25 accountability and transparency 
provisions that had bipartisan con-
sensus in my bill. 
Finally, one last thing I would like 
to address about my colleagues’ reck-
less tax and spending. I have heard 
some of my colleagues on the other 
side say this bill’s prescription drug 
provision is what I have described 
today as Grassley-Wyden. This is un-
true. This is a reckless tax-and-spend-
ing bill. It is not bipartisan, and no re-
porter should accept or repeat that no-
tion. 
I oppose the partisan bill because it 
is a long list of reckless tax increases 
and spending. It is not the bipartisan 
prescription drug bill that passed out 
of the Finance Committee 19 to 9. 
I will file the Prescription Drug Pric-
ing Reduction Act as an amendment 
today. We could strike and replace this 
reckless tax-and-spending spree with 
comprehensive 
drug 
pricing 
reform 
that could garner more than 60 votes 
and lower drug prices while holding Big 
Pharma and PBMs accountable. 
We could actually enact meaningful 
accountability and transparency in the 
pharmaceutical industry. I will file 
that amendment as well. We could pur-
sue PBM transparency and account-
ability, and I will file that amendment 
as well. 
I have said throughout this Congress 
that I will work with anyone who 
wants to pass the bipartisan-negotiated 
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act. 
To continue on the bill today, the 
Democrats’ most recent reckless tax- 
and-spending spree suffers from some 
serious 
policy 
whiplash. 
Just 
last 
week, all but one Democrat voted to 
provide nearly $80 billion in subsidies 
to some of the largest and most profit-
able corporations in the world. The 
goal then was to make America a more 
favorable business environment to at-
tract investments from a critical in-
dustry. 
But mere hours later, they unveiled a 
huge tax hike on domestic manufac-
turing. Democrats tried to justify this 
180-degree policy turn by claiming 
their tax hike is necessary to make 
corporations ‘‘pay their fair share.’’ 
However, this claim is laughable, given 
the so-called CHIPS+ bill nearly all 
Democrats enthusiastically supported 
last week. As I pointed out at that 
time, the CHIPS+ bill ensures many 
large, very profitable semiconductor 
manufacturers will pay zero tax or 
even receive payments from the IRS 
exceeding any tax liability. 
Yet Senator SANDERS was the only 
Democrat to express any concern about 
these 
profitable 
companies 
paying 
nothing in taxes. 
Under the Democrats’ so-called book 
minimum tax, large, profitable cor-
porations favored by Democrats can 
still escape paying any Federal tax. 
While they claim their reckless tax- 
and-spending bill will ensure compa-
nies pay their fair share, they include 
carve-outs and expanded subsidies for 
their favorite industries. 
For example, business tax credits are 
carved out from Democrats’ book min-
imum tax, including a myriad of 
souped-up green energy tax breaks.

S4066 
August 6, 2022 
This is despite the fact that research 
by the liberal Institute on Taxation 
and Economic Policy confirms these 
credits are a significant reason why 
seemingly profitable companies pay 
little or no tax. 
The Democrats’ bill not only carves 
out certain tax credits, it doubles down 
with $270 billion in corporate tax sub-
sidies in the name of their Green New 
Deal agenda. Along with a new provi-
sion that allows green energy devel-
opers to sell their credits to others, a 
host of businesses and industries will 
be able to use this new loophole to pay 
little or no tax. This could include fi-
nancial institutions, private equity 
firms, tech firms, and wealthy private 
investors. 
Democrats’ message to the business 
community is very clear: If you are a 
large, Democrat-aligned green indus-
try, you have nothing to worry about; 
paying your ‘‘fair share’’ of taxes is op-
tional. But if you are a domestic tex-
tile or electronics manufacturer, pre-
pare to be taxed into submission. 
This mindset is especially concerning 
given our increasingly fragile econ-
omy. Late last week, we learned our 
economy contracted for the second 
straight quarter, indicating, as we 
know, we are in a recession. The last 
thing businesses and families need 
right now are tax hikes and a rash of 
poorly vetted policies creating even 
more confusion and uncertainty in the 
economy. Nonpartisan analyses by the 
Joint Committee on Taxation and out-
side groups show this is exactly what 
Democrats are offering. 
During 
the 
election, 
Democrats 
promised not to raise taxes on anyone 
earning less than $400,000, but the Joint 
Committee on Taxation confirms their 
proposal does exactly the opposite. For 
2023 alone, Democrats propose a $17 bil-
lion tax hike on families and individ-
uals making less than $200,000. 
While 
Democrats’ 
tax 
hikes 
hit 
Americans of all incomes, their pro-
posed benefits are targeted at a privi-
leged few, like helping wealthy Ameri-
cans purchase $80,000 electric SUVs. 
According to the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, the original version of their 
bill had a whopping $155 billion tax 
hike on domestic manufacturing stem-
ming from their so-called book min-
imum tax. 
The National Association of Manu-
facturers estimated that this tax hike 
would cost more than 200,000 jobs, re-
duce labor income by $17 billion, and 
reduce GDP by nearly $70 billion. 
Now, I understand Senator SINEMA 
has since secured changes to the book 
minimum tax that may lessen the bur-
den on domestic manufacturers. How-
ever, even if we assume all the relief 
secured by Senator SINEMA accrues to 
manufacturers, the best-case scenario 
is manufacturers will still see a $100- 
billion-plus tax hit. 
Democrats’ inflation act still throws 
blue-collar workers overboard for their 
Green New Deal. The Democrats’ war 
on manufacturing is mind-boggling. 
Members of both parties have stressed 
a need to reshore manufacturing to ad-
dress supply chain disruptions and 
delink from China for national security 
reasons. Saddling manufacturers with 
a giant tax bill will hurt, not help, our 
efforts. Targeting manufacturers for 
tax hikes makes even less sense in the 
face of our surging inflation. 
Democrat tax hikes will curtail in-
vestments necessary to increase the 
supply of goods needed to meet con-
sumer demand. This mismatch between 
supply and demand is what is actually 
driving our inflation. The potential 
harm to our economy is underscored by 
Penn Wharton’s analysis of the Demo-
crats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
They called out the novelty and uncer-
tainty surrounding Democrats’ book 
minimum tax saying more work is 
needed to understand its impact on 
capital market efficiency and the econ-
omy. 
Penn Wharton’s analysis also shows 
Democrats’ proposals will do nothing 
to bring down inflation and are more 
likely to make inflation worse in the 
near term. Essentially, Democrats are 
gambling on untested and unproven 
policies while our economy is in a re-
cession, real wages are falling, and in-
flation is soaring. 
The truth is, Democrats’ reckless 
tax-and-spending spree is bad for jobs, 
bad for the economy, and won’t do any-
thing to address what Iowans care 
about the most: the rising cost of infla-
tion. 
I urge my Democrats to rethink your 
approach. Stop gambling with our Na-
tion’s economy.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
last year, Democrats in this body 
passed a party-line spending bill, and 
they spent us into record-high infla-
tion. Ever since then, this has been 
nothing but bad news for the working 
families of this country. 
We have seen the worst inflation in 
40 years. Prices have gone up faster 
than wages month after month after 
month. Fifteen months in a row now, 
prices are up faster than wages. 
Now, Democrats’ inflation has caused 
a recession. As a result, working fami-
lies are finding it much harder to get 
by. They can’t keep up. The average 
family can afford less today than they 
could the day that Joe Biden took of-
fice—much 
less. 
The 
savings 
rate 
hasn’t been this low since the great re-
cession. People are having to spend 
their savings. Credit card debt is at an 
alltime high. 
But the worst gut punch is about to 
happen right now, making all the pain 
the Americans have suffered now ex-
tend for a longer period of time. If 
Democrats pass this bill that is on the 
floor today, this inflation crisis is 
going to get worse. 
For weeks, there have been rumors 
that Democrats were working hidden 
behind closed doors on another reckless 
tax-and-spending bill. The American 
people knew it would be bad, and the 
bill that we are looking at now is worse 
than expected. 
Of course, the Democrats wrote it in 
secret. They didn’t want the American 
people to know what was inside it. 
Now, here we are, late on a Saturday 
afternoon, and the Democrats are try-
ing to cram it through before people 
even get to read it. Members of my 
party were wanting to read it earlier 
today. It wasn’t even available, likely 
because it wasn’t even written yet. 
I understand it is over 700 pages long. 
An earlier version, I saw 725 pages, 
with a cost of over a billion dollars a 
page. 
Democrats call it their bill that they 
intend to try to use to reduce inflation. 
But the more likelihood is that it will 
lead to double-digit inflation. Haven’t 
seen that since Jimmy Carter was in 
the White House. 
The Wharton School of Business does 
a budget model. It says that this bill, 
from everything that they have read so 
far, will actually increase inflation for 
the next 2 years. It is bad enough for 
the American people today. They can’t 
put up with it for another 2 years. 
Now, I am told that the Wharton 
analysis is usually the economic anal-
ysis that the Senator from West Vir-
ginia, JOE MANCHIN, uses. Well, I hope 
that Senator MANCHIN and every Mem-
ber of this body pays attention to that 
Wharton study. 
A chorus of economists is saying the 
exact same thing as the experts are 
telling us from Wharton. There is a 
nonpartisan 
group 
called 
the 
Tax 
Foundation, and it says ‘‘this bill may 
actually worsen inflation’’—worsen in-
flation. That is why I say we are look-
ing at the possibility of double-digit in-
flation. It is 9.1 percent now. 
Democrats’ favorite economist, Mark 
Zandi, says that the bill would almost 
have no effect on inflation. How is it 
going to lower inflation if it has no ef-
fect on inflation? And that is from a fa-
vorite of the Democrats. 
The Congressional Budget Office says 
the bill would have a negligible effect 
on inflation. Clearly, there is broad 
agreement among experts that the bill 
will not lower inflation. 
Democrats were warned the last 
time, March of 2021. Democrats are 
being warned again this time. And they

August 6, 2022 
are ignoring the warnings. But it 
doesn’t take an economist to tell you 
that this bill would be a disaster for 
working families. 
The bill is going to mean more taxes, 
more spending, higher prices—right in 
the middle of the combination of an in-
flation time and a time of recession. 
The cost, the burdens, of this bill are 
going to be borne by the working fami-
lies of this country. 
Now, this bill is going to hit working 
families from all sides. First, let’s take 
a look at the taxes. Tax revenues were 
already at record highs in this coun-
try—not enough for the Democrats but 
record alltime highs of tax revenue. 
Democrats want more—a lot more. 
The Democrats’ inflation bill would in-
crease taxes by nearly half a trillion 
dollars. Now, this includes a blatant 
violation of Joe Biden’s campaign 
promise when he said he wouldn’t raise 
taxes on middle-class families. 
The Joint Tax Committee says that 
this bill will raise taxes on the very 
people that Joe Biden said he wasn’t 
going to come after. The Joint Tax 
Committee actually said the bill will 
raise taxes on people at nearly every 
level of income. It will affect you, 
every one of you, all across this coun-
try. 
Now, Democrats, of course, want to 
raise taxes on American energy. It has 
been their claim since day one when 
Joe Biden basically put the target on 
the back of American energy and 
pulled the trigger. And, amazingly, 
they want to do it in the middle of an 
energy crisis. 
Remember, this is the energy crisis 
that the Democrats have created. When 
Joe Biden declared war on American 
energy, American families started pay-
ing the price and have been paying the 
price ever since then. 
The bill does nothing to open up ex-
ploration for energy and American oil 
on American properties on Federal 
lands. No. It includes a new tax on 
American oil and gas production. This 
tax alone will raise the cost of energy 
for half of the households in America. 
Now, this is at a time when one-third 
of the inflation in this country is driv-
en by the cost of energy. When you 
take a look at the cost of food, energy 
is a component of that. Growing food, 
getting food to market—all of those 
things are related to energy. That tax 
alone is going to shrink the economy 
and cost jobs. 
There is also a new tax on imported 
oil. And Joe Biden’s energy policy has 
been, basically: Please send us some 
oil. It was his policy last year when he 
went to Glasgow. And he actually 
asked Vladimir Putin to send us more 
oil from Russia as Russia was planning 
to invade Ukraine. He is trying to cut 
a deal with Iran to get Iranian oil. Ven-
ezuela—he sent emissaries to Ven-
ezuela asking for oil. And he went hat 
in hand last month to Saudi Arabia 
saying: Please send us more oil. 
And then the Democrats put in their 
bill an excise tax on that oil that the 
President is begging to have sent to 
America. And then to add insult to in-
jury, they indexed the tax to infla-
tion—high inflation begetting more in-
flation. It means the more inflation the 
Democrats cause, the higher the prices 
go up. More taxes, more inflation. 
This is a vicious cycle of Democrat 
taxes and Democrat inflation. As a re-
sult, the pain at the pump is going to 
get worse. Yet the worst punishment of 
all is for American coal production. 
Now, I am proud to say Wyoming has 
been America’s No. 1 producer of coal 
for decades. Coal is still the most af-
fordable, reliable energy known to 
man. It is used all over the world. Yet 
in this bill, the Democrats want to 
raise taxes on coal companies by up to 
16 percent of their income. 
Well, I am from a coal State. Senator 
MANCHIN is from a coal State. He and I 
worked together on the Energy Com-
mittee. He is the chair; I am the rank-
ing member. Here is what the West Vir-
ginia Coal Association has said about 
what is in this bill that we are going to 
be voting on starting tonight. JOE 
MANCHIN’s home State coal association 
said: 
Why support anything CHUCK
SCHUMER, 
Joe Biden, NANCY PELOSI, or John Kerry 
want for coal? 
They go on to say: 
It is incomprehensible why any miner [coal 
miner] would support the Manchin-Schumer 
legislation. 
This is going to punish West Virginia 
directly, and it is going to punish the 
hard-working people of Wyoming. It is 
also going to punish their customers 
who rely on affordable energy. 
These taxes are clearly going to get 
passed on to the consumer—in other 
words, higher prices, more inflation. 
Economics 101. 
The Democrats also want to raise 
taxes on savings and investment at a 
time when seniors are hurting. Seniors 
are already watching their savings go 
down and their taxes go up. Inflation is 
so bad that there are reports that sen-
iors are moving in together because 
they can’t afford to pay the rent. 
Yet CHUCK SCHUMER and Joe Biden 
want to raid their 401(k)s. This bill also 
contains a hidden tax increase. That is 
because the bill would nearly double 
the size of the IRS. 
Now, Democrats think that giving 
the IRS 80 billion additional dollars to 
hire additional auditors—tens of thou-
sands, over 80,000 more auditors at the 
IRS, an army of auditors—that they 
are going to be able to squeeze another 
$200 billion out of American taxpayers. 
They are not talking about a couple 
of rich people here. Eighty-six thou-
sand auditors aren’t needed to go after 
a couple of billionaires. They are going 
after mainstream America. They are 
going after families, farmers, after 
small businesses. 
The IRS is already one of the most 
powerful and unaccountable bureauc-
racies in the Federal Government. But 
the Democrats say: Not enough. We 
want to put you on steroids so you can 
squeeze more money out of the families 
of this country. 
The Joint Tax Committee says al-
most all of the money raised by super-
sizing the IRS would come from those 
making less than $200,000 a year. That 
is the Joint Tax Committee. 
So the billionaires in San Francisco 
and Manhattan who run the Democrat 
Party, they are going to be just fine. It 
is working families who always foot 
the bill for liberal policies. 
So what are Democrats going to do 
with half a trillion in new taxes? Well, 
they want to do what they do best: give 
taxpayer dollars to their closest friends 
and their biggest political contribu-
tors. That includes hundreds and hun-
dreds and hundreds of billions of dol-
lars for the big fans of the Green New 
Deal. 
The bill puts American taxpayers on 
the hook for more than $315 billion in 
green energy loan guarantees. This will 
be billions and billions for projects like 
Solyndra that went bankrupt when 
President Obama was in the office and 
Joe Biden was Vice President. You 
would have thought Joe Biden had 
learned those lessons from the horror 
stories of the money being lost, the 
taxpayer dollars wasted in projects 
that went bankrupt one after another 
after another. 
The bill would give billions and bil-
lions for rich people to buy electric ve-
hicles. Unlike other vehicles, electric 
vehicles, they pay no gas tax, which is 
how, of course, in this country that we 
pay for the roads and the bridges and 
the highways. Democrats want to cut 
them a big check as well. This is wel-
fare for the wealthy. 
The bill also includes supersized 
ObamaCare subsidies for people mak-
ing well over $100,000 a year. It is also 
welfare for the wealthy—supersized 
subsidies on steroids. 
Now, the subsidies were put in place 
at the beginning of the pandemic. They 
were supposed to be temporary. Yet 
Democrats seem to want them to con-
tinue forever. If Democrats extend 
these subsidies permanently, this bill 
would not actually help at all with the 
deficit. It would clearly add to the na-
tional debt. 
In other words, Democrats are using 
the same sleight-of-hand accounting 
gimmicks that they tried last year. 
Nine months ago, when Democrats 
tried things like this in their Build 
Back Better Plan that failed, even Sen-
ator MANCHIN
admitted that it was 
‘‘smoke and mirrors,’’ a shell game, 
and budget gimmicks. 
The Democrats are back to their old 
tricks right now. Here we are, 9 months 
later. The difference is, inflation is a 
lot, lot higher. The pain people have 
gone through is felt more deeply. 
Not a single Republican is going to 
vote for this monstrosity. No Democrat 
should either. Joe Biden’s economy is 
already the worst economy that most 
Americans have ever experienced in 
their lifetime. 
If Democrats pass this bill, it is going 
to get worse. And so I urge my col-
leagues, don’t inflict this kind of pain

August 6, 2022 
on the American people in the middle 
of a recession. The American people 
are hurting enough. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
to speak about a very important provi-
sion in the Inflation Reduction Act 
that combines the three pillars of the 
act: healthcare, energy, and tax re-
form. That provision is a permanent 
funding fix for the Black Lung Benefits 
Program. And I dedicate this floor 
speech to all my friends who are Vir-
ginia coal miners, to their retirees, to 
their families. And I especially dedi-
cate it to my friends at the United 
Mine Workers, including a dear friend, 
President Cecil Roberts. 
I came to Virginia in 1984, never hav-
ing been in Virginia. I grew up in Kan-
sas, and I didn’t really know too much 
about the coal industry. But I married 
my wife Anne 38 years ago, and part of 
her family is from Big Stone Gap, VA, 
in the heart of Appalachia—those coun-
ties in Southwestern Virginia—Wise, 
Lee, Dickenson, Russell, Buchanan, 
Scott—that have coal mining as the 
very heart of their economies. And it is 
not only coal mines, but it is the min-
ers themselves—many of whom drive 
across State lines to work in West Vir-
ginia or Kentucky—and their families. 
And they have done it for generations. 
And long before I got into politics, 
once I married my wife from Appa-
lachia, I got to know these miners. It is 
a tough job. It is a scary job. It is a 
dangerous job. But these miners do it 
every day because the Nation needs 
power, because our steel mills need 
steel to build aircraft carriers and sub-
marines and skyscrapers. And they do 
this, and many of them have done it for 
generations. 
I also, in coming to know these min-
ers—long before I got into politics—on 
family visits, realized what a patriotic 
bunch of people they are. They have a 
disproportionately high rate of service 
in the military when they are young, 
before they undertake this dangerous, 
dangerous job. 
I had been in Virginia for about 5 
years, and there was a major strike of 
these miners, the Pittston strike, in 
Southwest Virginia, 1989. It actually 
was from April of 1989 all the way until 
February of 1990. And it was a strike 
that was driven because the Pittston 
Coal Company wanted to take health 
benefits away from retirees and widows 
and disabled miners. 
And what the mineworkers realized 
is if they allowed this to happen, then 
every other mining company in the 
country would do exactly the same 
thing. And so they went out on a 
strike, and they struck for 10 months. 
And their salaries were down to noth-
ing, but they weren’t going to give up 
until they got these healthcare bene-
fits. 
There was a famous moment about 5 
months into the strike when the then- 
president of the UMW, Rich Trumka, 
who got to be a great friend of ours— 
sadly, he passed in the last year. At 
that point, he was the president of the 
mineworkers. He got asked by the New 
York Times: Your people are suffering 
striking. They are earning some bene-
fits through the union, but it is a frac-
tion of their salaries. How long can the 
mine workers hold out? 
And he gave one of the best answers 
ever: 1 day longer than the Pittston 
Coal Company. That is how long we 
can hold out. 
That is what they did. In February of 
1990, they reached a deal, and the 
healthcare benefits of these folks were 
saved. 
Getting into politics, first at the 
local level, but especially when I ran 
for Lieutenant Governor in 2001, I was 
kind of the big city mayor, but people 
down there gave me a chance because 
they knew I had family ties in Appa-
lachia. I had gotten to know them be-
fore I was in politics. 
The mine workers were so helpful to 
me. I tried, over my time in political 
life, to be helpful to them. I put a 
union president in my cabinet as a 
Governor, whom they knew very, very 
well, who had struck with them in 1989. 
No Governor had ever done that. I ap-
pointed a miner, a UMW member to 
run my State mining safety agency. 
That agency had always been run by 
folks from the management side or 
sometimes by hard-working, you know, 
kind of professional scientists and bu-
reaucrats. But there had never been a 
miner running the mining safety agen-
cy until I became Governor. 
I worked with mine workers to build 
a powerplant in Virginia City, in 
Southwest Virginia, to try to show 
that coal can be done and used much 
more cleaner than it had been in the 
past. 
When I came to the Senate in 2013, 
the economics of mining had changed a 
lot. Natural gas, being so much cheap-
er, had hurt mines. Mechanization of 
mining reduced the job numbers. We 
mine about the same amount of coal in 
Virginia today as we did 50 years ago. 
We just do it with one-tenth of the 
miners because of mechanization. 
The need to bring down our carbon 
usage to save the planet has definitely 
been a factor. I am proud to say that 
my miners and their leaders under-
stand this. They understand the need 
for an energy transition, and they em-
brace it. They just ask that, as we do 
it, we don’t leave them behind. 
That leads me to this bill. We have 
made promises to our miners that we 
will protect their health insurance, 
that we will protect their pensions, and 
that we will have a full-funded Black 
Lung Benefits Program to help the 
many miners—about one in five in Cen-
tral Appalachia, whose day in and day 
out job, inhaling coal dust and silica 
dust, exposes them to a horrible pul-
monary disease, black lung disease. We 
told them we will have a program for 
them to take care of their needs should 
they come down with black lung. 
You will remember, Madam Presi-
dent, in 2017, because of bankruptcies 
of coal companies, that many were set-
ting up shell corporations to evade 
their responsibilities to their retirees— 
just like in Pittston, taking health in-
surance away from retirees, widows, 
and disabled miners. Many companies 
have schemed with the Bankruptcy 
Code to do that. In 2017, the miners 
healthcare program for these retirees 
was on death’s door. I cosponsored leg-
islation with many colleagues, and we 
saved their healthcare program. 
I will never forget one of the tough-
est meetings I had in public life was 
going into a mining contact office in 
Castlewood, VA, and sitting down in a 
room of very nervous people who 
thought their healthcare benefits were 
going to expire within a matter of 
weeks. But we made a promise to them. 
And because of Democrats here—and 
we did get some Republican votes on 
this, as well—we saved healthcare for 
retirees, widows, and disabled miners. 
A couple of years later, in 2019, the 
same features of these companies—ar-
tificially, in many instances, going 
bankrupt—was now not just threat-
ening healthcare but was also threat-
ening pensions. People who had worked 
their whole lives in these dangerous 
jobs at risk to their health were going 
to lose their pensions. 
But in 2019, the American Miners 
Act, which was also bipartisan, passed 
this body, and we fixed the nationwide 
pension program for miners. It helped 
more than 6,000 Virginians. It helped 
more than 100,000 miners around the 
country. 
That is two. 
Well, with the passage of the Infla-
tion Reduction Act, we can go three for 
three. We can meet all the promises we 
made to these miners and their fami-
lies by fixing the Black Lung Benefits 
Program. 
The preceding speaker talked about 
raising taxes on mines, but he didn’t 
tell the public what this is for. We are 
raising the excise tax on coal so that 
we can have a program that will help 
miners who get black lung disease. 
And is this just a horribly confis-
catory tax? No. Let me tell you what 
this tax will be. We will raise the coal 
excise tax for coal mined underground 
to $1.10 a ton. For these hard-working 
miners who are underground, exposing 
themselves to life-risking pulmonary 
disease, we will raise the tax to $1.10 a 
ton. And for coal that is mined on the 
surface, we will raise it to 55 cents a 
ton to meet the promise that we made 
to these hard-working people. This will 
provide permanent sufficient funding 
to maintain the solvency of the fund, 
and our miners can be assured that the 
program will be—as they are going un-
derground every day and doing that 
tough job, they can be assured that the 
program will be there for them should 
they get black lung disease.

S4069 
August 6, 2022 
I have been proud to cosponsor all 
three of these bills—promise made, 
promise kept. 
I want to thank Virginia’s coal min-
ers for their friendship, for their patri-
otism, for their determination, and for 
never giving up, including never giving 
up on us. And when we pass the IRA, 
we will be able to say: Your faith was 
justified. We got it done. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the previous order be ex-
tended for 15 minutes and the majority 
leader be recognized at that time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, pub-
lic service is about making people’s 
lives better, and here is what is on 
offer this afternoon to make people’s 
lives better in our country: Reduced 
healthcare costs for seniors, reduced 
carbon 
emissions, 
reduced 
energy 
costs, and reduced cheating by wealthy 
tax cheats. That is just a part of what 
is on offer this afternoon. 
Let me just briefly touch on each of 
them. 
We all know that medicines are way 
too expensive in our country. People 
always come back from trips, and they 
say: Why is it so much cheaper over-
seas? 
It is because these big pharma-
ceutical companies are under abso-
lutely no restraints to hold down the 
prices, and that is what we are begin-
ning to change today. 
What we are beginning to change 
today is to say that for those seniors 
who count on Medicare, for the first 
time, the program that they love, 
Medicare, is going to have the power to 
negotiate lower drug prices for them. 
The fact is, the Senate is lifting a curse 
with this legislation. That is how sen-
iors feel when they hear that Medicare 
can’t even go to bat for them. And, of 
course, Big Pharma has protected this 
ban on Medicare negotiating like it 
was the Holy Grail. Even today, they 
are warning that when we pass this, 
they are going to try to tie it up with 
the courts and the State legislatures 
and the Agencies. But we are not going 
to let that happen. 
The 
prediction 
from 
some 
inde-
pendent authorities on medicine has 
said that because of the compounding 
benefits of our bill—with more drugs 
being negotiated on a regular basis—we 
are looking at the possibility of a tril-
lion dollars in savings before too long. 
If a drug company refuses to nego-
tiate, they are going to face a steep ex-
cise tax on the sale of their products 
until they come to the table. If they 
are price gouging, if they are raising 
their prices above the rate of inflation, 
say, for an older drug, they are going 
to pay a penalty. 
And then we have new significant re-
lief for seniors who, when they get 
mugged at the pharmacy counter, come 
home and say they just can’t pay all 
the bills. Our legislation puts a new 
$2,000 out-of-pocket cap on Medicare 
Part D so that seniors are no longer 
forced to choose between paying for 
medicine and paying for food. 
Those are all important benefits. The 
fact is, that penalty for price gouging 
is going into in effect in a couple of 
months, in November, so seniors are 
going to be able to say: We are seeing 
real relief from this legislation. 
There are other steps that we would 
have liked to take. I understand that. I 
pushed for them. The President of the 
Senate has pushed for them. But let’s 
understand the bottom line here. Every 
one of the policies I have outlined, on 
their own, is going to be life-changing 
for millions of senior citizens, and it is 
going to lay the groundwork for doing 
more. 
I would also like to move briefly 
from healthcare to climate because the 
Inflation Reduction Act includes the 
biggest effort in history to save our cli-
mate and invest in clean energy and 
jobs. And because we all worked to-
gether, those are going to be jobs here 
in America. They are going to be clean 
energy jobs in our country because of 
the black letter text that we wrote 
into the bill. 
The old system was a joke. It picked 
winners and losers, and anybody who 
was powerful could probably figure out 
how to get a tax break. And there were 
permanent breaks for oil and gas but 
only temporary incentives for clean en-
ergy. The system was broken. It was 
out of date a long time ago. 
We put that old system into the 
dustbin of history, and we put in place 
emissions-based credits to turbocharge 
investment in clean energy, clean 
transportation, and energy conserva-
tion. Our new plan is going to reduce 
the typical American household’s en-
ergy cost by $500 per year, and it is 
going to create 600,000 new jobs from 
Portland, OR, to Portland, ME. 
As the President of the Senate 
knows, we pay for this bill with a few 
important changes in our tax law. For 
example, we just showed a couple of 
days ago that of 100 companies—these 
are companies with billions of dollars 
in profits—they are paying—many of 
them, more than 100—an effective tax 
rate of 1.1 percent. 
Let me say that again: More than 100 
hugely profitable companies that are 
going to pay under this legislation, and 
the President of the Senate did very 
important work on this, they are pay-
ing, on average, 1.1 percent in taxes. 
Now, it is no surprise that those com-
panies that are paying 1.1 percent 
think that somehow making them pay 
a minimum rate—a minimum rate, by 
the way, which is far less than the rate 
that a firefighter and a nurse pay— 
that, oh, my goodness, we won’t have 
jobs, we won’t have businesses if they 
do. 
And we make it clear that we are not 
raising taxes on anybody. Anybody 
making less than $400,000 is not going 
to pay any additional taxes under this 
bill. I know there are some of our col-
leagues on the other side who have al-
ways subscribed to this trickle-down 
theory of economics and say that, well, 
if those at the very top—say, those cor-
porations paying 1.1 percent—actually 
pay some taxes, that means that nurses 
and firefighters are going to pay more 
taxes, and nurses and firefighters don’t 
buy that for a second. 
We also paid for the legislation in an 
important way that was proposed by 
our 
colleague 
from 
Ohio, 
Senator 
BROWN, that I was proud to join him 
on, and that is a 1-percent tax on stock 
buybacks. 
Corporations have spent trillions of 
dollars on stock buybacks in recent 
years, a huge windfall for corporate ex-
ecutives and wealthy shareholder. It 
set a record in 2018, broke it again in 
2021 right in the middle of a global pan-
demic, and I just noticed the profits of 
some of the biggest oil companies here 
in the last few weeks, again, they are 
kind of leading the league in stock 
buybacks. 
Stock 
buybacks 
make 
a 
lot 
of 
wealthy 
people 
even 
wealthier 
on 
paper, but they do very little to 
strengthen the economy, drive innova-
tion, or improve the well-being of 
American workers. 
Our 1 percent tax is not only going to 
help pay to prevent the worst effects of 
climate change, it is also going to en-
courage big corporations to invest in 
their workers and research and devel-
opment instead of more handouts to 
the top. 
Finally, I just want to emphasize this 
question of tougher IRS tax enforce-
ment. We have heard some of our col-
leagues on the other side say that 
somehow this is going to target the 
working person. I see our good friend 
from Delaware, another member of the 
committee. That is just not going to 
happen. And the reason it is not, as my 
colleagues on the Finance Committee 
know so well, working people are not 
the problem here. They pay taxes with 
every single paycheck. It is right there 
on their paycheck. Everybody knows 
what taxes they pay, and should they 
be engaging in any questionable activi-
ties, it would end up showing up on 
these forms. They are not the problem. 
But as we have been told again and 
again by independent experts, Demo-
crats, Republicans, and Independents, 
we do have a problem with big, wealthy 
tax cheats. Big, wealthy tax cheats 
don’t pay taxes with every single pay-
check like firefighters and nurses. 
And after a decade of Republican 
budget cuts, we are now in a very dif-
ficult 
position 
to 
go 
after 
these 
wealthy tax cheats who rip off the 
American people for billions of dollars 
every year. 
The current Commissioner who joins 
many Democratic Commissioners and 
Republican 
Commissioners 
in 
the 
past—the current one is a Republican 
appointee—estimated the number of

taxes owed that are not collected could 
be as much as a trillion dollars per 
year. 
We believe that the Agency ought to 
have the resources it needs to go after 
sophisticated, lawbreaking tax cheats 
at the top. And I know that my col-
leagues on the Finance Committee join 
me in saying: We are going to watch-
dog the Agency very carefully and 
make sure the focus is on these 
wealthy tax cheats and not the typical 
working person, as my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have talked 
about. 
So there you have it, folks. Here is 
what is on offer: What is on offer are 
lower costs for seniors, reduced climate 
emissions, help for working families, 
cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. 
That is what this is all about today. 
That is why this legislation, I believe, 
is going to give public service a good 
name. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. 
CARPER. 
Almost 
everything 
that is good that he has just talked 
about came out of the Finance Com-
mittee, terrific staff work, terrific 
leadership. Thank you. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-

f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022—Motion to Proceed 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
a moment, I will move to proceed to 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
The time has come for the Senate to 
begin debate on this historic piece of 
legislation. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is a 
groundbreaking bill for the American 
people—for families struggling to pay 
the bills, for seniors struggling to pay 
for medication, for kids struggling 
with asthma. This bill is for them. 
I thank all of my colleagues who 
have dedicated their blood, sweat, and 
tears toward shaping this outstanding 
legislation. 
This is one of the most comprehen-
sive and impactful bills Congress has 
seen in decades. It will reduce infla-
tion, it will lower prescription drug 
costs, it will fight climate change, it 
will close tax loopholes, and it will re-
duce—reduce—the deficit. It will help 
every citizen in this country and make 
America a much better place. 
The time is now to move forward 
with a big, bold package for the Amer-
ican people; to fight inflation and 
make it easier for people to afford ev-
erything from trips to the doctor’s of-
fice to trips to the pharmacy; to hold 
drug companies accountable and em-
power Medicare to negotiate the cost of 
prescription drugs; to help families pay 
their utilities with the boldest clean 
energy package in American history; 
to make sure that nurses and teachers 
and firefighters and middle-class fami-
lies don’t pay more in taxes than bil-
lion-dollar corporations; to reduce pol-
lution, restore our coastlines, protect 
our forests, and deliver to our children 
and grandchildren the planet they de-
serve. 
Again, the time is now to move for-
ward with a big, bold package for the 
American people. 
Again, this historic bill—this historic 
bill—will reduce inflation, lower costs, 
and fight climate change. It is time to 
move this Nation forward. 
Senate Democrats began this major-
ity by promising to tackle the biggest 
challenges facing our country. The In-
flation Reduction Act will make good 
on that promise and serve as the cap-
stone to one of the most productive 
stretches the Senate has seen in a very 
long time. And in the end, it will be the 
American people who benefit from the 
work we do here and now. 
MOTION TO PROCEED 
So I move to proceed to Calendar No. 
464, H.R. 5376. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 464, H.R. 
5376, a bill to provide for reconciliation pur-
suant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14.

‘‘(ii) the corporate AMT foreign tax credit

ending with such taxable year exceeds 
$1,000,000,000, and 
‘‘(ii) in the case of a corporation described 
in paragraph (2), such corporation meets the 
average annual adjusted financial statement 
income test for a taxable year if—

ments of clause (i) for such taxable year (de-
termined after the application of paragraph

ending with such taxable year is $100,000,000 
or more. 
‘‘(C) 
EXCEPTION.—Notwithstanding 
sub-
paragraph (A), the term ‘applicable corpora-
tion’ shall not include any corporation which 
otherwise meets the requirements of sub-

‘‘(II) has a specified number (to be deter-
mined by the Secretary and which shall, as

circumstances of the taxpayer) of consecu-
tive taxable years, including the most recent 
taxable year, in which the corporation does 
not meet the average annual adjusted finan-
cial statement income test of subparagraph 
(B), and 
‘‘(ii) the Secretary determines that it 
would not be appropriate to continue to 
treat such corporation as an applicable cor-
poration.

beginning after the first taxable year for 
which such determination applies.

PLICABLE CORPORATION STATUS.—

termining whether a corporation is an appli-
cable corporation under this paragraph, all 
adjusted financial statement income of per-
sons treated as a single employer with such 
corporation under subsection (a) or (b) of 
section 52 (determined with the modifica-
tions described in clause (ii)) shall be treated 
as adjusted financial statement income of

statement income of such corporation shall 
be determined without regard to paragraphs 
(2)(D)(i) and (11) of section 56A(c). 
‘‘(ii) MODIFICATIONS.—For purposes of this

mined without regard to the phrase ‘To the 
extent provided in regulations’ in such para-
graph (6)).

member’ has the meaning given such term 
by section 1563(b), except that the deter-
mination shall be made without regard to 
section 1563(b)(2). 
‘‘(E) OTHER SPECIAL RULES.— 
‘‘(i) CORPORATIONS IN EXISTENCE FOR LESS 
THAN 3 YEARS.—If the corporation was in ex-
istence for less than 3-taxable years, sub-
paragraph (B) shall be applied on the basis of 
the period during which such corporation 
was in existence. 
‘‘(ii) SHORT TAXABLE YEARS.—Adjusted fi-
nancial statement income for any taxable 
year of less than 12 months shall be 
annualized by multiplying the adjusted fi-
nancial statement income for the short pe-
riod by 12 and dividing the result by the 
number of months in the short period. 
‘‘(iii) TREATMENT
OF
PREDECESSORS.—Any 
reference in this subparagraph to a corpora-
tion shall include a reference to any prede-
cessor of such corporation. 
‘‘(2) SPECIAL RULE FOR FOREIGN-PARENTED 
MULTINATIONAL GROUPS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—If a corporation is a 
member of a foreign-parented multinational 
group for any taxable year, then, solely for 
purposes of determining whether such cor-
poration meets the average annual adjusted 
financial statement income test under para-
graph (1)(B)(ii)(I) for such taxable year, the 
adjusted financial statement income of such 
corporation for such taxable year shall in-
clude the adjusted financial statement in-
come of all members of such group. Solely 
for purposes of this subparagraph, adjusted 
financial statement income shall be deter-
mined without regard to paragraphs (2)(D)(i), 
(3), (4), and (11) of section 56A(c).

FOREIGN-PARENTED
MULTINATIONAL 
GROUP.—For purposes of subparagraph (A),

group’ means, with respect to any taxable 
year, two or more entities if—

poration and another entity is a foreign cor-
poration, 
‘‘(ii) such entities are included in the same 
applicable financial statement with respect 
to such year, and

‘‘(I) the common parent of such entities is 
a foreign corporation, or 
‘‘(II) if there is no common parent, the en-
tities are treated as having a common parent 
which is a foreign corporation under sub-
paragraph (D).

TRADE
OR
BUSINESS
WITHIN
THE
UNITED 
STATES.—For purposes of this paragraph, if a

rate domestic corporation that is wholly 
owned by the foreign corporation. 
‘‘(D) OTHER
RULES.—The Secretary shall, 
applying the principles of this section, pre-
scribe rules for the application of this para-
graph, including rules for the determination

‘‘SEC. 56A. ADJUSTED FINANCIAL STATEMENT IN-
COME. 
‘‘(a) IN
GENERAL.—For purposes of this 
part, the term ‘adjusted financial statement 
income’ means, with respect to any corpora-
tion for any taxable year, the net income or 
loss of the taxpayer set forth on the tax-
payer’s applicable financial statement for

For purposes of this section, the term ‘appli-
cable financial statement’ means, with re-

‘‘(c) GENERAL ADJUSTMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) STATEMENTS COVERING DIFFERENT TAX-
ABLE YEARS.—Appropriate adjustments shall

come in any case in which an applicable fi-

RELATED
ENTI-
TIES.— 
‘‘(A) 
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATE-
MENTS.—If the financial results of a taxpayer 
are reported on the applicable financial 
statement for a group of entities, rules simi-
lar to the rules of section 451(b)(5) shall 
apply. 
‘‘(B) CONSOLIDATED
RETURNS.—Except as 
provided in regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary, if the taxpayer is part of an affili-
ated group of corporations filing a consoli-
dated return for any taxable year, adjusted 
financial statement income for such group 
for such taxable year shall take into account 
items on the group’s applicable financial 
statement which are properly allocable to 
members of such group. 
‘‘(C) TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER 
AMOUNTS.—In the case of any corporation 
which is not included on a consolidated re-
turn with the taxpayer, adjusted financial 
statement income of the taxpayer with re-
spect to such other corporation shall be de-
termined by only taking into account the 
dividends received from such other corpora-
tion (reduced to the extent provided by the 
Secretary in regulations or other guidance) 
and other amounts which are includible in 
gross income or deductible as a loss under 
this chapter (other than amounts required to

retary) with respect to such other corpora-

the Secretary, if the taxpayer is a partner in 
a partnership, adjusted financial statement 
income of the taxpayer with respect to such

IN-
COME OF PARTNERSHIPS.—For the purposes of 
this part, the adjusted financial statement 
income of a partnership shall be the partner-

CERTAIN ITEMS OF FOREIGN INCOME.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If, for any taxable year, 
a taxpayer is a United States shareholder of 
one or more controlled foreign corporations, 
the adjusted financial statement income of 
such taxpayer with respect to such con-
trolled foreign corporation (as determined

date with respect to the initial price applica-
bility year that is 1 year after the initial

under 
paragraph 
(1)(B)(i)(II) (and for which the Secretary pre-
viously made a high likelihood determina-
tion under paragraph (3)) has not been li-
censed and marketed under section 351(k) of

clear and convincing evidence, the manufac-
turer of such biosimilar biological product 
has made a significant amount of progress 
(as determined by the Secretary) towards 
both such licensure and the marketing of 
such biosimilar biological product (based on 
information from items described in sub-
clauses (I)(bb) and (II) of paragraph (1)(B)(ii)) 
since the receipt by the Secretary of the re-
quest made by such manufacturer under 
paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I).

AND
NEGOTIATION.—If the 
Secretary determines that there is not a 
high likelihood that such biosimilar biologi-
cal product will be licensed and marketed as 
described in clause (i)(I) or there has not 
been a significant amount of progress as de-
scribed in clause (i)(II)— 
‘‘(I) the Secretary shall include the bio-
logical product as a selected drug on the list 
published under subsection (a) with respect 
to the initial price applicability year that is 
1 year after the initial price applicability 
year for which such biological product would 
have been included as a selected drug on 
such list but for subparagraph (A); and

(4) with respect to the year for which such 
manufacturer would have provided access to 
a maximum fair price for such biological 
product but for subparagraph (A). 
‘‘(iii) SECOND
1-YEAR
DELAY.—If the Sec-
retary determines that there is a high likeli-
hood that such biosimilar biological product 
will be licensed and marketed (as described

of such biosimilar biological product towards 
such licensure and marketing (as described

the inclusion of the biological product as a 
selected drug on the list published under sub-
section (a) until the selected drug publica-
tion date of such list with respect to the ini-
tial price applicability year that is 2 years 
after the initial price applicability year for 
which such biological product would have 
been included as a selected drug on such list

THE YEAR TWO DELAY.—If, during the time pe-
riod between the selected drug publication

uct would have been included as a selected 
drug but for subparagraph (B)(iii) and the se-
lected drug publication date with respect to 
the initial price applicability year that is 2 
years after the initial price applicability 
year for which such biological product would 
have been included as a selected drug on 
such list but for this subsection, the Sec-
retary determines that such biosimilar bio-
logical product has not been licensed and 
marketed— 
‘‘(i) the Secretary shall include such bio-
logical product as a selected drug on such 
list with respect to the initial price applica-
bility year that is 2 years after the initial 
price applicability year for which such bio-
logical product would have been included as 
a selected drug on such list; and 
‘‘(ii) the manufacturer of such biological

(4) with respect to the years for which such 
manufacturer would have provided access to 
a maximum fair price for such biological

defined under subsection (g)(7)) beginning 
after the price applicability period with re-
spect to such drug, subparagraphs (A) and 
(B) of paragraph (4) shall be applied as if the 
term ‘payment amount benchmark period’ 
were defined under subsection (g)(3) as the 
last year beginning during such price appli-
cability period with respect to such selected 
drug and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) 
shall be applied as if the term ‘benchmark

FORMATION.—The Secretary shall provide for 
a method and process under which, in the 
case where a PDP sponsor of a prescription 
drug plan or an MA organization offering an 
MA–PD plan submits revisions to the num-
ber of units of a rebatable covered part D 
drug dispensed, the Secretary determines, 
pursuant to such revisions, adjustments, if 
any, to the calculation of the amount speci-
fied in this subsection for a dosage form and 
strength with respect to such part D 
rebatable drug and an applicable period and 
reconciles any overpayments or underpay-

by adding at the end the following new sec-
tion: 
‘‘SEC. 45V. CREDIT FOR PRODUCTION OF CLEAN 
HYDROGEN. 
‘‘(a) AMOUNT OF CREDIT.—For purposes of 
section 38, the clean hydrogen production 
credit for any taxable year is an amount 
equal to the product of— 
‘‘(1) the kilograms of qualified clean hydro-
gen produced by the taxpayer during such 
taxable year at a qualified clean hydrogen 
production facility during the 10-year period 
beginning on the date such facility was origi-
nally placed in service, multiplied by 
‘‘(2) the applicable amount (as determined 
under subsection (b)) with respect to such 
hydrogen. 
‘‘(b) APPLICABLE AMOUNT.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—For purposes of sub-
section (a)(2), the applicable amount shall be 
an amount equal to the applicable percent-
age of $0.60. If any amount as determined 
under the preceding sentence is not a mul-
tiple of 0.1 cent, such amount shall be round-
ed to the nearest multiple of 0.1 cent. 
‘‘(2) APPLICABLE
PERCENTAGE.—For pur-
poses of paragraph (1), the applicable per-
centage shall be determined as follows: 
‘‘(A) In the case of any qualified clean hy-
drogen which is produced through a process 
that results in a lifecycle greenhouse gas 
emissions rate of— 
‘‘(i) not greater than 4 kilograms of CO2e 
per kilogram of hydrogen, and 
‘‘(ii) not less than 2.5 kilograms of CO2e 
per kilogram of hydrogen, 
the applicable percentage shall be 20 percent. 
‘‘(B) In the case of any qualified clean hy-
drogen which is produced through a process 
that results in a lifecycle greenhouse gas 
emissions rate of— 
‘‘(i) less than 2.5 kilograms of CO2e per

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that, for the 
duration of the Senate’s consideration 
of H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022, the majority and Repub-
lican managers of the bill, while seated 
or standing at the managers’ desks, be 
permitted to deliver floor remarks, re-
trieve, review, and edit documents and 
send email and other data communica-
tion from text displayed on wireless 
personal digital assistant devices and 
tablet devices. I further ask unanimous 
consent that the use of calculators be 
permitted on the floor during consider-
ation of the bill; further, that the staff 
be permitted to make technical and 
conforming changes to the bill, if nec-
essary, consistent with the amend-
ments adopted during Senate consider-
ation. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
H.R. 5376 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
want to take a moment to say a few 
words about the so-called Inflation Re-
duction Act that we are debating this 
evening. I say ‘‘so-called,’’ by the way, 
because, according to the CBO and 
other 
economic 
organizations 
that 
have studied this bill, it will, in fact, 
have a minimal impact on inflation. 
Let me put this reconciliation bill 
into the context of where we are as a 
nation politically and economically. 
The answer to that, as to where we are, 
is that we are not in a good place. 
According to the most recent Gallup 
poll, the approval rate for Congress is 
at 16 percent, with 82 percent of the 
American people disapproving of the 
work we are doing here. There are 16 
percent who think we are doing a good 
job and 82 percent who think not. 
Further, according to a recent Uni-
versity of Chicago poll, a strong major-
ity of Americans—and this is ex-
tremely important, and I hope Mem-
bers of Congress hear this—the major-
ity of Americans believes that the gov-
ernment is ‘‘corrupt and rigged against 
me.’’ People believe the government is 
corrupt and rigged against them. 
Further, according to a USA TODAY 
poll that came out last week, a very 
strong majority no longer believes that 
the Democratic or Republican Parties 
are responding to their needs and that 
we need to move to a multiparty sys-
tem. 
I think what is most frightening in 
terms of where the American people 
are politically today is that there is ac-
tually a growing number of Americans 
who believes that they may have to 
take up arms—take up arms—against 
their own government in order to ac-
complish what they think needs to be 
done. All of this speaks to a very, very 
dangerous moment for American de-
mocracy, and in a number of ways, it 
resembles the conditions that existed 
in Europe in the 1920s and early 1930s, 
which 
led 
to 
fascism 
and 
totali-
tarianism. 
In other words, at a time when so 
many of our people are hurting, many 
of them no longer believe that, in our 
democratic system, government is ca-
pable of responding to their needs, and 
they are losing faith in our democracy. 
The people of this country believe— 
and in my view correctly—that we 
have a corrupt political system, domi-
nated by the wealthy and the powerful, 
and that we have a rigged economy in 
which large corporations are seeing 
huge profits—in some cases, the heavi-
est profits ever—while the middle class 
and working families continue to see a 
decline in their standard of living. 
Let me just give you one small exam-
ple of what is going on, and that is 
within the last few weeks. 
While Americans continue to pay 
outrageously high gas prices at the 
pump—prices are going down, but they 
are still a lot higher than they were a 
year ago or 2 years ago—ExxonMobil, 
Shell, and BP reported a record-
breaking $46 billion in profits during 
the second quarter. People pay more at 
the gas pump, and the major oil compa-
nies are seeing huge profits. 
In terms of the extremely high price 
of prescription drugs, three large phar-
maceutical companies—Pfizer, Johnson 
& 
Johnson, 
and 
AbbVie—increased 
their profits last year by 90 percent to 
$54 billion, a 90-percent increase in 
their profits, while so many of our peo-
ple cannot afford the high cost of pre-
scription drugs. 
That is what a rigged economy is all 
about—huge corporate profits while 
working people cannot afford the basic 
necessities of life. 
Let us be clear about where we are as 
a nation, and that is that the American 
people are tired of press releases; they 
are tired of 30-second ads; they are 
tired of speeches. They are hurting, 
and they are begging their elected offi-
cials to respond to their needs. 
If you want to know why there is so 
much anger and so much frustration 
and so much disillusionment within 
our society today, it is important to 
understand that real weekly wages for 
the average American worker are lower 
today than they were 49 years ago, and, 
clearly, the inflation of today is push-
ing the average person even further be-
hind. 
Not so many years ago, when I was a 
kid, it was possible for one worker in a

S4146 
August 6, 2022 
family-like my father, who never made 
enough money—to earn enough money 
to take care of his kids and the family. 
Today, that is a rarity. Today, it is 
necessary in almost all cases for two 
workers in a family to have to go out 
to work. 
Today, despite the huge increases in 
our economy, despite the tremendous 
explosion of technology, everything 
being equal, our younger generation 
will have a lower standard of living 
than their parents—having a harder 
time finding a home and having a hard-
er time affording being able to have a 
family. Imagine that. Our younger gen-
eration having a lower standard of liv-
ing than their parents. 
Half of our people today live pay-
check to paycheck, and many millions 
are working for starvation wages: 9, 10, 
11 bucks an hour. Further, many work-
ers around the country who want to 
join a union and engage in collective 
bargaining 
at 
companies 
like 
Starbucks, Amazon, and other places 
are facing fierce and illegal anti-union 
resistance. I have to say that this leg-
islation does not address any of their 
needs. 
This legislation does not address the 
reality that we have more income and 
wealth inequality today than at any 
time in the last 100 years, where three 
people own more wealth than the bot-
tom half of America; doesn’t address 
the fact that 95 percent of all new in-
come is going to the top 1 percent; 
doesn’t address the reality that CEOs 
of major corporations are making 350 
times what their workers are making. 
I think everybody knows that we 
have 
a 
completely 
dysfunctional 
healthcare system. We now spend over 
$12,000 a year per person—more than 
double what other countries spend. 
Today, over 70 million Americans are 
uninsured or underinsured, and there 
are studies out there that say that 
some 60,000 people a year die because 
they are uninsured or underinsured, 
and they don’t get to a doctor on time. 
Meanwhile, every year, the insurance 
companies make tens of billions of dol-
lars in profit. 
So we have a system in which the 
cost is outrageously high, people are 
dying because they don’t get to a doc-
tor on time. This bill does nothing to 
address the systemic dysfunctionality 
of the American healthcare system. It 
does nothing. 
In terms of our kids—the future of 
our Nation—shamefully, we have the 
highest rate of childhood poverty of al-
most any major nation on Earth. This 
bill, as currently written, does nothing 
to address that. 
Our childcare system is dysfunc-
tional. If a working family is lucky 
enough to find a slot for their young 
one, on average, they will pay about 
$15,000 a year for childcare, an impos-
sibly high sum of money. Imagine that. 
Fifteen thousand dollars a year for 
childcare if you are making 40 or 50,000 
bucks. That is an absurd sum of 
money. Yet this bill turns its back on 
the working parents of the country and 
our children, does not even begin to ad-
dress the childcare or pre-K crisis that 
we face. 
A nation will be as great and com-
petitive as its educational system is. 
Yet, today, hundreds of thousands of 
bright young kids all across this coun-
try are unable to afford a higher edu-
cation. Imagine that. In the richest 
country in the history of the world, 
when we need the best educated work-
force possible, you have got hundreds 
of thousands of young people who can-
not afford a higher education. And we 
have 45 million Americans who are 
struggling with student debt, some-
times outrageous levels of student 
debt. This bill, as currently written, 
does nothing to address it. 
Today, millions of elderly Americans 
and half of our senior citizens are try-
ing to survive on $25,000 a year or less. 
Millions of senior citizens are unable 
to afford to go to a dentist. Imagine 
that. In the richest country on Earth, 
elderly people can’t afford to go to a 
dentist. Their teeth are rotting in their 
mouth; they can’t afford hearing aids 
in order to hear what their kids, grand-
children have to say; and they can’t af-
ford eyeglasses. This bill ignores that 
issue. It does nothing to expand Medi-
care 
to 
cover 
those 
very 
basic 
healthcare needs. The result, millions 
of seniors will continue to have rotten 
teeth and lack the dentures, hearing 
aids, or eyeglasses they deserve. 
I hear this all the time in Vermont, 
and I expect my colleagues hear it as 
well, so many—so many—of our elderly 
or disabled people would much prefer 
to stay in their homes rather than be 
forced into nursing homes. They need 
someone to come to their home to help 
them with their basic needs. I don’t 
think anyone denies that we have a 
major crisis in home healthcare, and 
the 
people 
who 
are 
doing 
home 
healthcare now—and God bless them 
all—are usually overworked and under-
paid. This bill, as currently written, 
does nothing to address that crisis. 
Again, no debate; everybody agrees 
that we have a major housing crisis in 
America. Some 600,000 people are home-
less, sleeping out on the streets in 
every State in this country. In addition 
to the homeless issue, nearly 18 million 
households are paying 50 percent or 
more of their limited incomes for hous-
ing. Imagine that. Imagine what it 
means when you don’t have any money 
to do anything else when you are pay-
ing 50 percent of your limited income 
for housing. Yet this bill does nothing 
to address the major housing crisis 
that we face or build one unit of safe 
and affordable housing—just another 
issue that we push aside. 
And I would say—and every working 
person understands this—that while or-
dinary 
people 
are 
struggling 
with 
childcare, with healthcare, with hous-
ing, with the basic necessities of life, 
the people on top today are doing phe-
nomenally well. During the pandemic 
alone, the billionaire class saw an al-
most $2 trillion increase in their 
wealth. 
So that, in a snapshot, is where we 
are as a nation today: Working people 
are hurting; in many ways, their stand-
ard of living is in decline; and people 
on top are doing phenomenally well. 
That takes us to where we are this 
evening. The importance of the bill 
that we are considering this evening is 
that it is not a normal—not a regular 
piece of legislation. It is a reconcili-
ation bill. I know that to anybody out-
side of the beltway, that doesn’t mean 
much. But what it does mean is that, 
unlike regular legislation here in the 
Senate, this bill does not require 60 
votes to get passed. All we need to get 
this bill passed are 50 votes, plus the 
Vice President, if it is a tie. 
Now, I say this in all honesty, that it 
is extremely sad to me—and I think 
the American people—that up to this 
point, we have not had one Republican 
come forward and say: You know what? 
I want to work on the housing crisis, 
on the healthcare crisis, on the edu-
cation crisis, on the home healthcare 
crisis. Sadly, we have not had one Re-
publican come forward who is prepared 
to stand up for working families, for 
the children, for the elderly, or for the 
environment. That is a sad state of af-
fairs. 
But here is the truth: If all 50 Mem-
bers of the Democratic caucus were to 
stand together today, we could pass 
some enormously important amend-
ments, which would have a profound 
impact on improving the lives of work-
ing people in our country and maybe, 
just maybe, could begin the process of 
restoring faith in our democracy. 
Poll after poll makes it clear that 
not only are the American people hurt-
ing, they want Congress to take bold 
action to improve their lives. And 
under the budget reconciliation proc-
ess, we have the opportunity to do 
that. If we don’t do it now, when all we 
need are 50 votes, it is quite question-
able as to when, in fact, we will ever do 
that. 
In other words, what I am asking 
today is for all 50 Members of the 
Democratic caucus to come together 
and begin the process of addressing 
some—not all, some—of the major cri-
ses facing working families. 
It is absolutely imperative that we 
show the American people that we are 
capable of representing the needs of or-
dinary people, not just billionaire cam-
paign contributors, not just lobbyists 
but ordinary people who are hurting 
today. And if we cannot do that, not 
only will people continue to hurt and 
suffer, but, to my mind, it is question-
able for how long we remain a democ-
racy. 
Let me say a few words about what is 
in this legislation, a bill which has 
some good features but also, in my 
view, has some very bad features. 
This bill deals with three major 
areas: prescription drugs, climate, and 
taxation. Let me deal with at least two 
of them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4147 
August 6, 2022 
Prescription drugs. Now, I know that 
in Vermont, and I suspect in Wisconsin 
and all over this country, people are 
outraged at the fact that they are pay-
ing so much for prescription drugs. 
They are outraged that in some cases, 
we pay 10 times more than Canada and 
other countries for the same exact 
product. 
Now, the good news is that this bill, 
this reconciliation bill, will do what 
should have been done many years 
ago—something that many of us called 
for many years ago—in that it will 
allow Medicare to begin negotiating 
prescription drug prices with the phar-
maceutical industry. 
Now, that is not a radical idea. That 
is an idea that exists in probably every 
other major country on Earth, and that 
is why their prices are so much lower. 
They don’t let the drug companies 
charge any price that they want. That 
is the good news. 
But here is the bad news, and we 
must be honest about it: At a time 
when so many of our people cannot af-
ford the prescription drugs they need, 
one out of four Americans can’t even 
fill the prescriptions their doctors 
write, this Medicare-negotiating provi-
sion will not go into effect for 4 years, 
at which time only 10 drugs will be ne-
gotiated, with more to come in later 
years. So if anybody thinks that as a 
result of this bill we are suddenly going 
to see lower prices for Medicare, you 
are mistaken. It ain’t gonna happen 
next year, the year after, the year 
after, and the year after that. By the 
way, given the incredible power of the 
pharmaceutical industry, I would sus-
pect even money that they will figure 
out a way to get around this provision 
if it takes 4 years to implement. 
Furthermore, this provision will have 
no impact on the prices for those 
Americans who are not on Medicare. So 
if you are under 65, this bill will not 
impact you at all, and the drug compa-
nies will be able to continue to go on 
their merry way and raise prices to any 
level that they want. 
Under this bill, at a time when the 
drug companies are enjoying huge prof-
its, the pharmaceutical industry will 
still be allowed to charge the American 
people by far the highest prices in the 
world for prescription drugs. 
So that is the reality of this bill. 
What do we do? Well, if we are serious 
about responding to what the Amer-
ican people want—and the polling that 
I have seen, it is like 70 or 80 percent of 
the people understand that prescrip-
tion drugs are much too high. They 
want us to act. This bill, unfortu-
nately, does not do that. If we are seri-
ous about reducing the price of pre-
scription drugs, we know exactly how 
we can do it. 
For over 30 years, the Veterans’ Ad-
ministration has been negotiating with 
the pharmaceutical industry to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. More-
over, for decades, virtually every other 
country on Earth has been doing the 
same thing. The result of where we are 
today is that Medicare pays twice as 
much for the exact same prescription 
drugs as the VA and people all over 
this country. In some cases, as I men-
tioned earlier, we may pay up to 10 
times as much for a particular drug. 
In other words, when it comes to re-
ducing the price of prescription drugs 
under Medicare, we do not have to re-
invent the wheel; we could simply re-
quire Medicare to pay no more for pre-
scription drugs than the VA. That is 
not a radical idea; that is a simple 
idea. You have one government Agency 
doing what they are doing for 30 years. 
All we have to do is have Medicare do 
the same. If we did that, we could lit-
erally cut the price of prescription 
drugs under Medicare in half in a mat-
ter of months, not years. 
That is why I am introducing an 
amendment today to do just that. 
Under this amendment, we could save 
Medicare $900 billion over the next dec-
ade. This is nine times—nine times— 
more savings than the rather weak ne-
gotiation provisions currently in the 
bill. We could save $900 billion by nego-
tiating rather than $100 billion. 
The reason that we pay the highest 
prices in the world for prescription 
drugs is not hard to understand. During 
the past 20 years, the pharmaceutical 
industry has spent over $5 billion on 
lobbying and over half a billion dollars 
in campaign contributions. Further, 
the pharmaceutical industry has over 
the years mounted an unprecedented 
lobbying effort in Washington and in 
States all across this country. 
Now, what is unbelievable—if you 
want to know what a corrupt political 
system is about, if you want to know 
what money in politics is about, if you 
want to know what corporate greed is 
about, if you want to know why we pay 
the highest prices in the world for pre-
scription drugs, please understand that 
right now, at this moment, the phar-
maceutical industry has more than 
1,700 well-paid lobbyists on Capitol Hill 
to protect their interests, including 
former congressional leaders of both 
major 
political 
parties. 
They 
buy 
Democratic leaders; they buy Repub-
lican leaders; they buy former Mem-
bers of Congress—1,700 well-paid lobby-
ists—to make sure they continue to rip 
off the American people and charge us 
the highest prices in the world for pre-
scription drugs. That is over 3 lobby-
ists for every 1 Member of Congress; 535 
Members of Congress, 1,700 lobbyists. 
(Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE 
assumed 
the 
Chair.) 
Mr. President, just yesterday—now, 
this is really interesting, and I think it 
brings it all out—the CEO of PhRMA, 
whose name is Stephen Ubl, I think, 
basically said—and I appreciate his 
honesty and straightforwardness—he 
said anybody who votes even for this 
incredibly tepid bill—he said: We are 
going to go after you. He stated—and I 
love this kind of modesty—he said: 
Few associations have all the tools of mod-
ern political advocacy at their disposal in 
the way that PhRMA does. 
In other words, if you dare to vote in 
any way to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs, we are going to spend all of 
the money we have—and we have end-
less, unlimited amounts of money— 
against you. That is what a corrupt po-
litical system is about. That is what 
corporate greed is about, basically the 
CEO of PhRMA saying: You vote for 
this bill, you can expect millions and 
millions of dollars of 30-second ads 
against you. That is where we are in 
the state of our democracy today. 
Prescription drugs is a huge issue, 
but it is not the only issue that is dealt 
with inadequately in this legislation. It 
is my view, I think it is the view of the 
majority of the American people, and 
it is certainly the view of the scientific 
community that climate change is an 
existential threat to the planet. Now, 
that sounds like a big word, ‘‘existen-
tial,’’ but what it means is that if we 
don’t get our act together, there may 
not be a planet that is healthy and 
habitable for our children and grand-
children. It is very fundamental. Do we 
protect future generations? 
This legislation provides $370 billion 
over the next decade to combat climate 
change and to invest in so-called en-
ergy security programs. Now, the good 
news—and it is good news—is that this 
legislation as currently written would 
provide more funding for energy effi-
ciency and sustainable energy than has 
ever been invested before. That is the 
good news. But the bad news is that 
this bill as currently written includes a 
huge giveaway to the fossil fuel indus-
try, both in the reconciliation bill that 
we are considering and in a side deal 
that was just made public a few days 
ago. 
Under this legislation, the fossil fuel 
industry will receive billions of dollars 
in new tax breaks and subsidies over 
the next 10 years on top of the $15 bil-
lion in tax breaks and corporate wel-
fare they already receive every year. 
Interestingly enough, that may well 
be the reason why BP, one of the larg-
est oil companies in the world, sup-
ports this bill. It may be the reason 
why Shell, another huge oil company, 
supports this bill. It is the reason, I 
suspect, why the CEO of ExxonMobil is 
pleased by many of the provisions in-
cluded in this deal. So we ought to 
think a little bit about what it means 
when major oil companies that are in 
the process of destroying this planet 
support this legislation. 
Under this bill, up to 60 million acres 
of public waters must be offered up for 
sale each and every year to the oil and 
gas industry before—before—the Fed-
eral Government can approve any new 
offshore wind development. To put that 
in perspective, 60 million acres is the 
size of the State of Michigan. Further, 
under this bill, up to 2 million acres of 
public lands must be offered up for sale 
each and every year to the oil and gas 
industry before leases can move for-
ward for any renewable energy develop-
ment on public lands. 
In total, this bill will offer the fossil 
fuel industry up to 700 million acres of

public lands and waters to oil and gas 
drilling over the next decade—far more 
than the oil and gas industry could 
possibly use. 
And that is not all. The fossil fuel in-
dustry will not just benefit from the 
provisions in the reconciliation bill as 
currently written; a deal has also been 
reached to make it easier for the fossil 
fuel industry to receive permits for 
their oil and gas projects. This deal 
would approve the $6.6 billion Moun-
tain Valley Pipeline, a fracked gas 
pipeline that would span over 300 miles 
from West Virginia to Virginia and po-
tentially on to North Carolina. This is 
a pipeline that would generate emis-
sions equivalent to that released by 37 
coal plants or by over 27 million cars 
each and every year. 
Let me quote from a July 29 letter 
from over 350 environmental organiza-
tions, including Friends of the Earth, 
Food & Water Watch, and the Climate 
Justice Alliance, expressing concerns 
about this bill, and I quote: 
Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or 
fast-tracking of fossil fuel permitting is in-
compatible with climate leadership. Oil, gas 
and coal production are the core drivers of 
the climate and extinction crises. There can 
be no new fossil fuel leases, exports, or infra-
structure if we have any hope of preventing 
ever-worsening climate crises, catastrophic 
floods, deadly wildfires, and more, all of 
which are ripping across the country as we 
speak. We are out of time. Therefore, we’re— 
These 350 organizations— 
calling on you— 
That is the President, leadership of 
Congress— 
to fulfill your promise to lead on climate, 
starting with denying approvals for the 
Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting all new 
federal fossil fuel leases onshore, in the Gulf 
of Mexico, in Alaska, and everywhere else, 
and preventing any fast-tracked permits for 
fossil fuel projects. 
Mr. President, I would ask unani-
mous consent to print the full letter 
into the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
July 29, 2022. 
Re Hold the line against fossil fuel expan-
sion. 
DEAR
PRESIDENT
BIDEN
AND
MAJORITY 
LEADER SCHUMER: As frontline communities 
and organizations with millions of members 
and supporters, we thank you for your tire-
less efforts to secure a climate deal with 
meaningful renewable energy investments. 
At the same time, we respectfully urge you 
to reject any handouts to the fossil fuel in-
dustry. Put simply: you cannot address the 
climate emergency by sacrificing commu-
nities, expanding fossil fuel production and 
embracing fossil fuel industry scams like 
carbon capture, fossil fuel hydrogen, and car-
bon offsets. 
Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or 
fast-tracking of fossil fuel permitting is in-
compatible with climate leadership. Oil, gas 
and coal production are the core drivers of 
the climate and extinction crises. There can 
be no new fossil fuel leases, exports, or infra-
structure if we have any hope of preventing 
ever-worsening climate crises, catastrophic 
floods, deadly wildfires, and more—all of 
which are ripping across the country as we 
speak. We are out of time. Therefore, we’re 
calling on you to fulfill your promise to lead 
on climate, starting with denying approvals 
for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting 
all new federal fossil fuel leases onshore, in 
the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and every-
where else, and preventing any fast-tracked 
permits for fossil fuel projects. 
Permitting new fossil fuel projects will 
further entrench us in a fossil fuel economy 
for decades to come—and constitutes a vio-
lent betrayal of your pledge to combat envi-
ronmental racism and destruction. Today’s 
high gasoline and energy prices cannot be 
solved with promises of future oil and gas 
production. Climate chaos harms every per-
son in America, but our communities bear 
the brunt of the deadly impacts of the toxic 
fossil fuel industry: primarily Indigenous, 
Black, Latinx, AAPI and other communities 
of color, as well as low-wealth communities. 
Young people, women, and so many others 
that turned out to elect you and gave you 
your mandate to govern need climate hope, 
not 
climate 
setbacks. 
New 
fossil 
fuel 
projects will also lock workers into a dying 
industry and delay the growth in sectors 
that will support jobs of the future. 
Critically, none of these negotiations af-
fect the need for President Biden to imme-
diately declare a climate emergency and use 
his existing authority to reject fossil fuel 
projects. Declaring a climate emergency will 
unlock President Biden’s full set of powers 
to not only release Defense funding to build 
renewable and just energy systems, but also 
confront fossil fuels head-on by stopping 
crude oil exports. With non-emergency pow-
ers, President Biden can reject new oil and 
gas leases, and deny all fossil fuel infrastruc-
ture that harms countless communities 
across the country. Unleashing executive 
powers should be pursued in concert with— 
and not instead of—passing critical climate 
legislation, and vice versa. 
We respectfully implore you to hold the 
line against any new fossil fuel projects, re-
ject handouts to oil and gas companies, and 
use every tool available to advance a truly 
just, renewable energy future that does not 
sacrifice our communities.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, here is 
what the Center for Biological Diver-
sity had to say on this bill: 
This is a climate suicide pact. It’s self-de-
feating to handcuff renewable energy devel-
opment to massive new oil and gas extrac-
tion. The new leasing required in this bill 
will fan the flames of the climate disasters 
torching our country, and it’s a slap in the 
face to the communities fighting to protect 
themselves from filthy fossil fuels. 
Now, in my view, we have to do ev-
erything we can to take on the greed, 
the irresponsibility, the destructive-
ness of the fossil fuel industry, not give 
billions of dollars in corporate welfare 
to an industry that has been destroying 
our planet. That is why I will be intro-
ducing an amendment today to strike 
all of the benefits to the fossil fuel in-
dustry that are in this bill, and I will 
be asking for a rollcall vote on it. 
Let me say a word about some of the 
other amendments that I will be intro-
ducing. I will be introducing an amend-
ment that is wildly popular—the con-
cept is wildly popular—and that is to 
expand Medicare to include dental, vi-
sion, and hearing benefits. This amend-
ment is fully paid for by demanding 
that the wealthiest people start paying 
their fair share of taxes. 
Further, I will be introducing an 
amendment to provide $30 billion to es-
tablish 
the 
Civilian 
Conservation 
Corps, which would create 400,000 jobs 
for young people to combat climate 
change. The entire younger generation 
wants to roll up their sleeves and get 
involved in the effort to transform our 
energy system away from fossil fuel, 
and this amendment and the establish-
ment of a Civilian Conservation Corps 
would allow them to do that. 
Further, I will be introducing an 
amendment to expand the $300-a-month 
child tax credit for the next 5 years by 
restoring the top corporate tax rate 
from 21 to 28 percent. As you know, we 
made significant progress in lowering 
childhood poverty in America—we re-
duced it by 40 percent—with the estab-
lishment of a child tax credit, but un-
fortunately that was not continued in 
this year, and I think it needs to do so. 
So, bottom line, this is where we are 
at. 
The American people are hurting. 
Tens of millions of workers are falling 
further and further behind. The elderly 
are hurting. The kids are hurting. And 
people are looking to their elected rep-
resentatives in Washington to finally 
address the crises they are facing. 
In a reconciliation bill, where we 
only need 50 votes and the Vice Presi-
dent, we have the capability, if we pass 
these amendments, of taking a giant 
step forward not only in addressing the 
needs of our kids, our elderly, and 
working families but in maybe—just 
maybe—beginning to restore the con-
fidence of the American people in their 
democracy, in believing that their 
elected officials are listening to them 
and not just lobbyists and wealthy 
campaign contributors. 
I look forward to offering these 
amendments and getting them passed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from South Carolina is rec-
ognized. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 
myself 20 minutes from the bill. 
So where to start? Well, I thought 
long and hard about how to explain 
this to the American people, and the 
only thing I can tell you is ‘‘insanity’’ 
is defined as doing the same thing and 
expecting a different outcome. 
So here we are with the same people 
coming up with a plan to help you. 
How well did that work out the last 
time these 50 people were going to save 
you and your family? You will eventu-
ally come to the conclusion, I hope, 
they generally don’t know what they 
are doing.

get in the car. The best way to stop 
this tax-and-spend and inflationary 
madness is to fire some of the 50 so 
they can’t keep doing this to your fam-
ily. 
In March of 2021, we had a debate. 
Senator SANDERS—very good man. And 
everybody over there told us that if we 
pass the American Rescue Plan, your 
life will be dramatically better. As $1.9 
trillion passed with Democratic votes 
alone in March of 2021, not one Repub-
lican voted for it. 
Since then, we have been able to pass 
an infrastructure bill in a bipartisan 
manner. We passed legislation trying 
to keep guns out of the hands of men-
tally unstable people and generally 
help with that problem. We have come 
together around Ukraine to help them 
beat the Russians. We have come to-
gether to designate Russia as a state 
sponsor of terrorism. My oligarch 
friend up there—the guy who hates 
oligarchs more than anybody—we have 
come together to try to go after the as-
sets of the Putin cronies. So it is not 
like we can’t work together. But what 
you are not going to get from our side 
is buy-in on really bad ideas. 
So to the American people, the same 
people telling you what this bill is 
going to do are the same people who 
told you the American Rescue Plan 
would work. 
Let’s go down memory lane here for 
a second. Here is what the Vice Presi-
dent said about the $1.9 trillion Amer-
ican Rescue Plan passed in March of 
2021 with Democratic votes alone: 
Help has arrived for the families that have 
struggled to put food on their table, for the 
small businesses that have struggled to keep 
their doors open. Help has arrived, America. 
This was said in 2021. She promised 
you help was on the way if you pass the 
Democratic American Rescue Plan. 
Here is what Senator SCHUMER said: 
We have heard a lot about how the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan will prime the American 
economy to come roaring back. Economists 
are already projecting that economic growth 
could double as a result of the American Res-
cue Plan. 
March 16, 2021. I don’t know where 
their economists are today, but I hope 
they are not in the economy business 
because they sure as hell didn’t know 
what they were talking about. 
So what has happened from those 
statements to now? Instead of help 
being on the way, helping you put food 
on the table—see if that makes sense 
to you. The American Rescue Plan has 
helped put food on the table. Help is on 
the way for business. 
In March of 2021, before the American 
Rescue Plan, inflation was at 2.6 per-
cent. Today, it is at 9.1. Do you think 
it is an accident this has happened? If 
you do, you probably shouldn’t be driv-
ing. You are a danger to yourself or 
others. 
We told you—and by God, God knows 
the Republicans are by no means per-
fect—but we told you what was going 
to happen, that we had a struggling 
economy because of COVID, and this 
tax-and-spend, growing the govern-
ment, throwing money at everything, 
is going to come back to bite us in the 
ass, and it did. Take a hundred bucks 
and go to the grocery store and see 
what you get for it. You have to get a 
mortgage on your house to fill up your 
car. 
This is no accident. And the same 
people who told you then they had it 
figured out for you are telling you 
something now that I think is throwing 
gasoline on the fire that you are living 
with. That is why every Republican 
will vote no. Senator SANDERS is reluc-
tantly going to vote yes. I am going to 
enthusiastically vote no. I don’t mind 
working with Democrats when it mat-
ters and it helps, but this, to me, is in-
sane. 
So here is where we find ourselves as 
a nation. We find ourselves as a nation 
in a recession. If a Republican would be 
President, I doubt if most of the media 
would doubt we are in a recession. It is 
defined as a period of temporary eco-
nomic decline during which trade and 
industrial activity are reduced, gen-
erally identified by falling GDP in two 
successive quarters. The first quarter 
was 1.6 negative growth; the second 
quarter was 0.9. Over time, unfortu-
nately, it is probably going to get 
worse because we are going to have to 
raise interest rates to control rampant 
inflation, and that is going to make it 
harder to borrow money and invest in 
the economy. 
On top of that, they are about to pass 
a bill without one Republican vote that 
will take every problem they created in 
March and make it dramatically worse. 
Let’s go down sort of what life is like 
in America right now. They told you 
that help would be on the way, that the 
economy would double if we passed 
their bill in March of 2021. It didn’t 
quite work out that way, did it? Gaso-
line has gone up 59.9 percent—it will 
eventually come down because the 
economy is coming to a halt; 34 percent 
increase in airfare, if you can get a 
plane to leave in the same month you 
schedule it; electricity rates, 13.7; food, 
10.4; chicken, 18.6; cereal, 14.2—this is 
sort of what I eat; bacon—I love 
bacon—10.8 percent increase. 
The bottom line is, the American 
Rescue Plan did not help your family. 
It is not helping your business. It has 
taken every problem we had from 
COVID and made it worse. And what is 
their solution? To do the same thing 
all over again in a different way. 
What is in this bill that makes me 
say that? When you ask people: Does 
the Inflation Reduction Act reduce in-
flation—I mean, not me; not any of the 
50 of us; but just ask somebody who 
sort of like is supposed to know what 
they are talking about, and they will 
tell you it does not. The whole bill is a 
lie. 
The American Rescue Plan should be 
called the American Recession Plan, 
and this Inflation Reduction Act is a 
lie. It is not going to reduce inflation 
in any meaningful way. We have the 
highest inflation in 40 years. And here 
is what the Penn Wharton School of 
Business says: that it has a negligible 
impact. The Manchin-Schumer bill is 
going to make inflation worse. 
Here is what Penn Wharton, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania Business School, 
said: ‘‘Low confidence that legislation 
will have any impact on inflation.’’ Bill 
would actually cause inflation to rise 
until 2024. 
These people could give a damn. No-
body is going to convince them to stop 
taxing and spending as long as they 
have the ability to do it. 
Penn Wharton—it was sort of the 
bible for Senator MANCHIN
when he 
stopped Build Back Better, and I am 
glad he did. But they are telling him 
that what he and others are saying 
doesn’t actually work. 
CBO—supposed to be the bible, ac-
cording to Senator MANCHIN—has a 
negligible—I can’t say that word—very 
little effect on inflation. They said it 
would not reduce inflation in 2022 and 
inflation would go up or down 0.1 per-
cent in 2023. 
These are the people who wrote the 
budget bible telling all of you that 
what you are saying is not true, but 
you don’t care. You could care less. 
So here is what the bill does. Here is 
why none of us are going to vote for it. 
How many of you think now is a good 
time to create a new gas tax? It is not. 
So let me tell you what is in this bill. 
This bill has a 16.4 cents-per-barrel new 
gas tax on all imported oil and petro-
leum products and all domestic crude 
refined in America, which will create 
billions of dollars of new gas taxes at a 
time we need to have less gas taxes, in 
my view. 
So in the name of climate change, 
this bill increases gas taxes. It brought 
back from the dead a 1995 tax that was 
9.7 cents per barrel on imported oil, in-
creased it to 16.4 cents at a time of 
high gas prices, and included domestic 
crude refined in America. Pennies be-
come dimes, and dimes become dollars. 
So if you are looking to increase gas 
taxes, your ship has come in; vote for 
this bill. If you think it is dumb as dirt 
to have a new gas tax with this econ-
omy, vote for my amendment that 
comes up later. 
What else does the bill do? It in-
creases taxes. You have to be shocked 
about that. It increases taxes by bil-
lions—hundreds of billions—and they 
say it won’t affect you. Well, the CBO 
analysis and Penn Wharton said that 
the effect of the tax increases on busi-
ness will be passed down to people who 
make below $100,000 a year. Just think 
about—does that make sense to you? 
You increase taxes on a business. They 
pass it along to their customers. That 
is just sort of the way the economy 
works. 
The 15-percent minimum tax—how 
does that work? The tax eliminates ex-
pensing for equipment and other items 
a business may purchase to grow their 
business, which we created in 2017, in 
the same year you buy it. So what does

August 6, 2022 
CBO say about that? CBO says this bill 
will deincentivize purchasing equip-
ment and building factories. 
Think about what I just said. You are 
about to push on the American people 
another bill that will raise gas taxes 
and deincentivize investment in the 
private sector in the area of equipment 
and factory expansion at a time we 
need it the most. 
What 
does 
this 
bill 
do 
on 
the 
healthcare front? ObamaCare subsidies 
under this proposal will go to people 
making $304,100 as a couple for a family 
of four. Let me ask you, is now the 
time to subsidize ObamaCare for people 
making $304,000 a year? That is what is 
in this bill. 
Now, here is my favorite part. 
This bill has a plan to hire 87,000 new 
IRS agents—new ones. That is enough 
to fill up the Rose Bowl. That is bigger 
than the British Army. They are going 
to propose hiring 87,000 new IRS agents 
and they promise you this is only going 
to go after the rich. You should not be-
lieve that. This is an army of IRS 
agents who are going to go after every-
body about everything to fill the insa-
tiable desire of our friends on the other 
side to take money from you to spend 
up here. 
There will be more new IRS agents 
than the British Army, the German 
Army, the entire combined military of 
Canada, the French Air Force and 
Navy—literally an army of new IRS 
agents, and you should worry about 
what these people may do. 
As I tried to tell people last time, the 
American Rescue Plan wasn’t going to 
rescue you; it was going to make your 
life worse. And it did. We have 9.1 per-
cent inflation, the highest in 40 years. 
Senator SANDERS is right. People are 
hurting out there. Let’s work together 
to help. But you are not helping any-
body. At the time you promised us help 
was on the way, inflation was at 2.6 
percent. Because of the help you gave 
the economy, it is at 9.1 percent. 
Here is what we are trying to tell you 
over here. If this bill passes, the prob-
lems you face today are going to get 
worse. And we will remind you in No-
vember. 
Prescription drugs—in this bill, they 
identify 15 drugs they are going to have 
price controls on. They talk about the 
price in Canada. Most new drugs come 
from this country, not Canada. So let’s 
make Canada pay more for the re-
search and development done in our 
country to help the world. That makes 
some sense to me. But price fixing is a 
socialist idea that has never worked 
anywhere. Even Richard Nixon tried it. 
It didn’t work. 
And during COVID, we should have 
learned one thing: The private sector 
developed drugs to keep a lot of people 
alive and out of the hospital, and I am 
glad they were able to do it. Operation 
Warp Speed was a tremendous success, 
and it was done by the American phar-
maceutical industry. 
After this exercise is over, the idea of 
new drugs coming online is going to go 
down, and the socialist model that Sen-
ator SANDERS embraces is going to hurt 
innovation. He is a fine man, but he is 
a 
Democratic 
socialist. 
This 
bill 
doesn’t go far enough for him, but it 
goes way too far for you. 
As I am hoping and praying that one 
of you over there would agree with me, 
let’s don’t raise gas taxes now; let’s 
don’t raise taxes on business so they 
can invest in buying new equipment 
now; let’s don’t spend a bunch of 
money subsidizing ObamaCare for peo-
ple who make over $300,000 now. 
But that is probably what we are 
going to do unless we can convince one 
person over there to reject this mad-
ness. I am telling you, ladies and gen-
tlemen throughout the country, this is 
madness. 
Our 
Democratic 
friends, 
wherever too big, there is some plan to 
tax and spend on something. They are 
nice people, but they consistently have 
a view about what to do for the econ-
omy that is not working. 
I beg and plead with one Democrat: 
Listen and learn from what you did 
last time. Senator MANCHIN has been 
strong at times, but he voted for the 
American Rescue Plan. He is telling us 
this will reduce inflation when CBO 
says it will not. He is telling us that 
this will improve the economy when 
Penn Wharton says it won’t. No matter 
what anybody says, they are hell-bent 
on doing this because they can. I hope 
after this election, they can’t do this 
anymore. 
Here is what I think it is going to 
take: one Democrat admitting maybe 
the American Rescue Plan didn’t work 
and this won’t work. Maybe there is 
one among you. But if there is not, to 
the American people: In November, I 
hope you will remember this. Help is 
not coming by passing this bill. Help 
was not on the way by passing the 
American Rescue Plan. Misery came 
from that massive tax-and-spend bill, 
and we are about to pile misery on top 
of misery. We are about to increase gas 
taxes at a time you can’t afford it. 
To my Republican colleagues: You 
should enthusiastically vote no. To my 
Democratic 
colleagues: 
Apparently, 
you haven’t learned a damn thing 
about what you did last time. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
last time the Senate was in this posi-
tion, the last time Democrats grabbed 
control of our economy on a party-line 
vote, they spent $1.9 trillion and stuck 
Americans with the worst inflation in 
40 years. 
Every Senate Democrat cast the de-
ciding vote for this inflation night-
mare. Their historic mistake has left 
American families spending thousands 
of dollars extra just to avoid losing 
ground. 
In President Biden’s America, forget 
about getting ahead; you have to pay a 
multi-thousand-dollar 
inflation 
tax 
just to stand still. 
Millions of households haven’t been 
able to keep up with Democrats’ sky-
rocketing prices no matter how hard 
they have tried. They have had to 
watch their families’ hard-earned liv-
ing standards just slip away—all be-
cause, a year and a half ago, Senate 
Democrats tried to take over our econ-
omy on a party-line vote. And today, 
they want to do it again. 
Washington Democrats have already 
robbed American families once through 
inflation. Now, they say the solution is 
to rob the country a second time. They 
say they need a second reckless taxing 
and spending spree to clean up the 
damage from their first one. 
Every homeowner in America knows 
that if you call a plumber to fix a 
leaky faucet and they end up flooding 
your entire house, you don’t give them 
a blank check and a second chance. 
You show them the door. 
President Biden’s approval on the 
economy is 30 percent. An outright ma-
jority of the country—including more 
than one in four Democrats—agree 
that Democrats’ policies have actively 
made the economy worse. 
Democrats have lost the country’s 
confidence. They have lost the people’s 
trust. The voters who placed their fam-
ilies’ financial futures in Democrats’ 
hands have been betrayed. And they 
know it. 
Sadly, there is no shortage of crises 
that Americans would like this govern-
ment to address: an inflation crisis; an 
energy crisis; a violent crime crisis; a 
border crisis. 
But this weekend, today’s Demo-
cratic Party is being unusually honest 
about their top priority. They are pull-
ing out all the stops. They have twist-
ed every arm. And for what? Not tak-
ing back our economy from inflation. 
Not taking back our streets from mur-
ders and carjackings. Not taking back 
our border from chaos and deadly 
drugs. 
That is what the American people 
want addressed. But none of that is on 
the agenda this weekend. 
President Biden may have won the 
fight for the Democratic Party’s nomi-
nation, but our colleague Chairman 
SANDERS sure did win the war for its 
soul. 
This reckless taxing and spending 
spree is a clear catalog of Washington 
Democrats’ top priorities. It shows the 
American people what they care about. 
And here it is: They want hundreds of 
billions of dollars in job-killing tax 
hikes, 86,000 new IRS agents, new taxes 
on American oil and natural gas that 
will hammer consumers and reduce en-
ergy independence, and a money grab 
from Americans’ medicine cabinets 
that will lead to fewer new lifesaving 
cures in the future. 
They want to stick a shaky economy 
with historic tax hikes, in order to set 
up a colossal Green New Deal slush 
fund. To give rich people tax credits for 
buying $80,000 electric cars and new ap-
pliances. To send taxpayer money di-
rectly to far-left protest groups. To 
buy government agencies fleets of 
brand-new 
electric 
vehicles 
while 
working families can’t afford the used 
car lot.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

And all of it is just unbelievably ex-
pensive liberal performance art be-
cause experts say none of this ‘‘retail 
therapy’’ for rich liberals and bureau-
crats will make a dent at all in the fu-
ture trajectory of global tempera-
tures—No meaningful impact on the 
world’s climate. None. 
That is why none of our Democratic 
colleagues can talk about actual re-
sults. Have you noticed that? They 
only have one talking point: that this 
is the biggest climate investment ever. 
That is just a way of admitting that 
the only historic thing is the gigantic 
price tag. 
Democrats still define success by how 
much of your money they get to take 
from you in taxes and waste in spend-
ing. That is the exactly the attitude 
that got us in this mess. That is ex-
actly the far-left mindset that has 
crushed 
American 
families 
for 
18 
months and counting. 
Our colleagues want to tax and spend 
unfathomable sums of money without 
making an inch of progress on our citi-
zens’ top priorities. Washington Demo-
crats call that a big success. Do you 
know what the American people call 
it? The lowest Presidential approval 
rating after 18 months in modern his-
tory. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to-
night to talk about the Inflation Re-
duction Act. I am limited on time. I 
will try to keep within my 5 minutes. 
I wanted to start by just kind of pro-
viding a brief summary. This is legisla-
tion that will do a number of things, 
all of which are helpful to American 
families and the American economy. 
First of all, it will lower the cost of 
prescription drugs for seniors. It will, 
in fact, lower the cost of energy, the 
prices people pay for energy. 
On the prescription drug front, we 
talk about lowering costs and empow-
ering Medicare, for the first time, to 
begin to negotiate for lower prices. It 
also caps the out-of-pocket costs that 
Medicare beneficiaries pay at $2,000. In 
Pennsylvania, the estimate is that 
there are more than 73,000 Pennsylva-
nians that pay more than $2,000 a year 
for prescription drugs. Every one of 
those 73,000-plus Pennsylvanians and 
more will benefit from capping out-of- 
pocket costs. 
It lowers costs for families, but it 
also reduces the threat of climate 
change and reduces the deficit at the 
same time—all of that while reducing 
emissions between now and 2030 by 
some 40 percent. And this may be the 
very last time—the very last time— 
that we have an opportunity to take 
action in a substantial way against the 
threat of climate change. The Pre-
siding Officer has worked on this issue 
for years. He knows of what I speak 
better than anyone. This may be the 
last chance to take action on climate 
change. 
Thirdly, and not by way of a com-
plete summary, it extends the Afford-
able Care Act subsidies—the subsidies 
that were provided in the American 
Rescue Plan, the enhanced subsidies 
and premium tax credits. Those sub-
sidies will be extended to 2025. 
Again, I will personalize it to Penn-
sylvania. This directly affects at least 
100,000 people. Sixty thousand people in 
our State will lose all of their insur-
ance coverage if we don’t pass this bill; 
another 40,000 will have their subsidies 
taken away; and several hundred thou-
sand will have their premiums go up. It 
affects 100,000 people directly and sev-
eral hundred thousand people directly 
or indirectly. 
Then, of course, this bill creates mil-
lions and millions of jobs over the 10 
years that the bill has been measured. 
After we pass the Inflation Reduction 
Act, which will reduce inflation—that 
is what we are told by some 126 econo-
mists. Larry Summers and others have 
said the same thing. It will fight infla-
tion in the ways that have already 
been spoken about. But after we pass 
this bill, this strong bill for the Amer-
ican economy and for American fami-
lies, we have more work to do. We have 
to continue our work to pass legisla-
tion to invest in home- and commu-
nity-based services for seniors and peo-
ple with disabilities. We have to invest 
in childcare and institute again what 
we did in the American Rescue Plan 
when we put dollars in the pockets of 
American families raising children by 
taking the Child Tax Credit and en-
hancing that Child Tax Credit. 
We have to invest in prekindergarten 
education and paid family leave. We 
have to invest and protect the Med-
icaid program and extend it. 
We have so much more to do. 
I will just spend my remaining min-
utes talking about one issue, the issue 
I started with on that list, the home- 
and community-based services issue. 
This is an issue that people across the 
country have come to talk to us 
about—about a senior or loved one that 
they want to have home care and can’t 
get it because they are on the waiting 
list as it is approaching a million peo-
ple or a person with a disability who 
wants that same kind of care in the 
home or in the community. 
I met a lot of people and listened to 
them and listened to their stories. Two 
come to mind in particular: Someone 
who needs that care—his name is Bran-
don 
Kingsmore—and 
his 
caregiver 
Lynn Weidner. 
I visited Brandon’s home with Lynn 
there and learned firsthand what they 
are up against every single day in that 
home. Some months later, Brandon had 
the chance to meet with the President 
in my hometown of Scranton. One 
thing that he said about Lynn as a 
caregiver and caregivers overall—he 
said the following. He said: 
I would not be able to have the life that I 
have without Lynn’s help. 
[Caregivers] give us a substantial life. 
That is what one Pennsylvanian said 
about the care he receives. Every fam-
ily should have that opportunity to 
have care in the home or in the com-
munity, and they can’t get that under 
current law. The only option for most 
families is care in a nursing home or 
other institutional care. If someone 
wants that care, that is great. A lot of 
those nursing homes do really good 
work. 
But here is the problem. So many 
Americans should have the right to 
have care in their home, and they don’t 
have that opportunity today. We have 
to pass legislation to do that. The Bet-
ter Care Better Jobs bill does that. 
Jobs for home care workers—we have 
to get that pay up. We can’t be a Na-
tion that claims to be the greatest 
country in the world and pay home 
care workers just $12 an hour. That is 
not going to provide the care that our 
families need. This bill is about jobs 
for home care workers; care, obviously, 
for seniors and people with disabilities; 
and support for family caregivers. More 
than 50 million Americans—more than 
50 million Americans—are providing 
care to a loved one. They are saving us 
money by doing that—saving the Na-
tion money—but they are caring for a 
family member out of an act of love. 
We have to help them a lot more than 
we do. 
The last two more points I will make 
are: We can decide to go forward and 
just say your only option as a senior or 
a person with disability is to go to a 
nursing home or an institutional set-
ting. If we continue to do that, the cost 
of that is $90,000 per person; or we can 
invest in home- and community-based 
services and not pay $90,000 per person, 
but we can pay just $26,000 per Amer-
ican for that kind of care. So it has a 
huge cost benefit as well as the com-
pelling moral argument that we should 
provide these opportunities. 
This bill we are going to pass tonight 
or tomorrow morning or whenever we 
pass it is a good bill for families—low-
ering costs, helping seniors with pre-
scription drugs, and really moving for-
ward on action against climate change. 
After it has passed, we are going to 
continue to work on these other issues. 
I want to end with this. I want to 
thank members of my staff who have 
particularly worked so hard the last 18 
months on a range of issues but, in par-
ticular, the ones who work on home- 
and community-based services and will 
continue that fight with us: Stacy 
Sanders, Michael Gamel-McCormick, 
Narda Ipakchi, Josh Kramer, and so 
many others who have done good work, 
just like so many members of staffs of 
so many Senators here tonight. 
But let’s get the Inflation Reduction 
Act passed tonight, and let’s move for-
ward on these other issues in the 
months ahead. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Indiana.

S4153 
August 6, 2022 
HONORING AND CELEBRATING THE 
LIFE 
AND 
LEGACY 
OF 
REP-
RESENTATIVE JACKIE WALORSKI 
Mr. YOUNG. I yield myself 10 min-
utes from the bill time. 
Mr. President, I rise today to honor 
the lives of four Hoosiers who were lost 
tragically in a car accident this week, 
Edith 
Schmucker, 
Zachary 
Potts, 
Emma Thomson, and Representative 
Jackie Walorski. We grieve them all, 
and we pray for their families and 
friends. 
This is, of course, a profoundly dif-
ficult time for those of us who knew 
one or more of these Hoosiers. It is 
such a difficult time for their families 
and their friends, and all of us, I know, 
we commit to do whatever it is in our 
power to comfort their loved ones in 
the difficult days ahead. 
Like everyone here and back home in 
Indiana, I am absolutely heartbroken. I 
think one thing that hit everyone par-
ticularly hard was the loss of two 
young congressional staff members. 
Whether you knew Zach or Emma 
personally or not, you certainly know 
their type if you are watching these 
proceedings on Capitol Hill. You know 
the type of hard-working, smart, com-
mitted, young person that comes to 
work on a congressional staff. They 
dedicate so much of their time and 
their talents. Other opportunities are 
given up in order to serve their country 
and to work toward the betterment of 
their Nation. 
We should celebrate their accom-
plishments while we grieve their loss. 
It is a reminder, I think, for all of us to 
thank the many congressional staff 
members who do much more than the 
public will ever know. 
I want to take a few minutes today 
to pay tribute to our colleague right 
here in the Halls of Congress, Jackie 
Walorski. 
Jackie and I came to Congress at 
roughly the same time—she, 2 years 
after me—and I will never forget when 
she arrived here at the U.S. Capitol. 
Jackie didn’t need time to get her ‘‘sea 
legs.’’ No, Jackie knew that she be-
longed here. Jackie understood that 
this was her calling. She didn’t need 
people to tell her that she belonged. 
She got right to work because she had 
some things to accomplish. 
I have to say that her confidence was 
infectious. Everyone saw it. Everyone 
was impressed by it. People loved being 
around her, including me. 
Jackie had so many other amazing 
qualities, and I would like to highlight 
a number of those today. She was al-
ways so full of energy. It was a positive 
energy. She was a lightning bolt. She 
could light up a room like no other. 
In fact, in my observation, she only 
had two speeds, it was full-bore on and 
off. She was high-spirited and full of 
fire. 
Jackie also had a really big heart. In 
fact, her heart was as big as it was 
good. She wore it on her sleeve every 
day, every moment of the day. 
She didn’t hide her convictions. In 
fact, she made sure that they were ex-
pressed in the boldest, most colorful 
fashion. Her convictions were deeply 
held. She was proud of them. It is what 
made Jackie ‘‘Jackie.’’ She was of deep 
convictions, clearly, not just with her 
politics. No, it came from a deeper 
place. She had deep convictions with 
respect to her religious faith. 
I have to say that for all the many 
speeches I saw her deliver and for all 
the people I saw her energize, it was 
often after she delivered a prayer—and 
I saw her deliver a number of those— 
that audiences gave their most heart-
felt ovations. 
Jackie was a larger than life figure, 
but Jackie was never fake. She was 
never contrived. She was beloved, in 
fact, because she inspired and moti-
vated people with a passion that was so 
authentic, so human. 
And Jackie cared about the people 
she connected with. She was genuinely 
concerned. She was what you might 
call the genuine article. 
Jackie was also very smart, not just 
energetic. She was very smart. As a 
member of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, you could see that on a 
regular basis. But even in a casual con-
versation, Jackie had a habit of cut-
ting right to the issue. But, more im-
portantly, Jackie was smart about the 
people she represented. She knew their 
hearts. She knew their concerns. She 
knew their challenges. She knew their 
aspirations. She studied them. She 
lived it. She stayed in touch with 
them. 
She never forgot whom she worked 
with. She never forgot whom she 
worked for, and she never forgot who 
sent her to Washington. 
Jackie also had courage. She was a 
fearless leader. You see this in your 
best leaders. She didn’t flinch in the 
face of tough votes. No, Jackie was 
smart 
enough 
to 
know 
the 
con-
sequences, but she wasn’t afraid. She 
did what she thought was right. She 
did it for the right reasons, and she had 
enough self-confidence to go explain 
her votes to her constituents. It was, at 
once, a confidence in herself, but it was 
also a confidence in those she rep-
resented. 
She was a leader, confident in her 
own abilities and confident in the abili-
ties of those around her. 
If there is a single memory of Jack-
ie’s time in this building, the U.S. Cap-
itol and, I would say, her time in the 
Indiana statehouse, it was that she is 
indeed a leader. Since Jackie’s passing, 
I have had the opportunity to discuss 
her service, her life with a number of 
people, and this keeps coming up. She 
was a real leader. This is what they are 
talking about. 
For all of these amazing qualities, I 
have to say personally that there is 
something else that I keep coming 
back to. It is the first thing I come 
back to when I think of Jackie, and, 
frankly, it is very personal to me. 
I am going to miss Jackie’s laughter. 
She had a beautiful, bellowing laugh, 
uninhibited, so authentic, not con-
trived. It came from a place where she 
appreciated humor. She appreciated, at 
times, the absurdity of life. 
She always had a joke at hand or 
funny observation to make, or maybe 
she had read something recently she 
wanted to share with me. But we had 
so many great laughs together, and she 
could make my side hurt in fairly short 
order. I am going to miss that. 
And it is really hard to believe that 
our paths won’t ever cross again. They 
crossed so frequently, sometimes in 
this building but, typically, it was in 
Indiana’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict, back home. It was rare, I would 
say, that I didn’t go into that region 
and encounter her or, at least, follow 
in her tracks. 
She was so active, so engaged. I am 
going to miss those encounters. Just a 
few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to 
visit with Jackie in person. We shared 
some laughs, of course. It was at a din-
ner in Elkhart County. 
We were scheduled to be together 
this coming week to attend a ribbon- 
cutting ceremony. She was constantly 
on the road serving, doing her job. It is 
not too much to say that that was her 
calling. 
It is also not too much to say that 
Jackie’s last breath was spent in serv-
ice, in service to her constituents, to 
her God, to the great State of Indiana, 
to her country, to her calling. 
Jackie loved and she was ever faith-
ful to all of those things to the great 
benefit of Indiana and America, and for 
that I am grateful, for that we loved 
her back, and we will miss her dearly. 
Let that be her legacy. 
I yield to my colleague from Indiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. I yield myself five min-
utes from the bill time. 
I rise today to honor the life of Con-
gresswoman Jackie Walorski. Three 
others were lost in the tragic accident. 
Like I said last week, it is a real gut 
punch to any of us who knew Jackie 
and to Hoosiers across the board. The 
outpouring of grief for the lives lost 
has been immense in our State. As 
Hoosiers share their memories of them, 
you can see just how important all 
those lives were. 
Let me talk about Jackie. I got to 
know her early on when I was enter-
taining running for Senate. She was up 
in the north central part of Indiana, a 
place that I had been very little, and 
she was engaging. I spent get-togethers 
with her before and then after I was 
elected, and Todd said it well: Whom-
ever she came across, she was their 
friend, full of enthusiasm. She never 
really knew a stranger. 
I got to know her better over the 
years since then, and I can tell you 
that faith, family, and community 
were the principles that guided her, 
and times of mourning show us just 
how important those things truly are. 
As the friends and family grieve for 
the four lives lost in this tragedy, I 
hope they can find consolation in their

faith, in their families, in their com-
munities, and in the memory of their 
loved ones. 
Zach Potts was a rising presence in 
Indiana politics. He was the district 
chair, also the Republican chair of St. 
Joe County, an up-and-comer. He is re-
membered by friends as someone who 
truly cared, who didn’t ask, ‘‘What’s 
wrong?’’ but instead asked, ‘‘How can I 
help?’’ 
Emma Thomson, Jackie’s commu-
nications director, is remembered by 
those who knew her as creative, funny, 
driven, committed to the idea that peo-
ple are the most important thing in 
politics. 
Edith Schmucker is remembered as a 
loving mother and a big-hearted friend 
to all at the assisted living facility 
where she worked and served others. 
I hope you will join me and Todd in 
praying for their friends and their fam-
ilies. As we honor the lives of Jackie, 
Zach, Emma, and Edith, their legacies 
will live on in those whose lives they 
touched. 
And Jackie was a living testament to 
what it means to be a ‘‘good and faith-
ful servant.’’ She lived it out every 
day, and she will truly be missed. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of S. Res. 748, 
which is at the desk. I further ask that 
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 748) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I 
yield myself 30 minutes from the bill 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 5376 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I 
would like to start my remarks by 
going back to nearly the very begin-
ning of this Congress, when we were de-
bating what was called the American 
Rescue Plan. We were told then by our 
colleagues on the other side that this 
was going to save the country: $1.9 tril-
lion of debt-financed spending, they 
said, was going to fix everybody’s con-
cerns in the United States. 
Where are we today? 
A 9.1-percent consumer price infla-
tion, which we told them was coming; 
gas prices doubling; economic stagna-
tion; GDP contracted by nine-tenths of 
a percent in the second quarter. 
We are now arguing over semantics 
about what is a recession. 
Sixty-five percent of the people in 
this country think we are already in a 
recession, and more than 80 percent of 
the country think our economy is on 
the wrong track. 
The 
nonpartisan 
Penn 
Wharton 
Budget Model has made a comment 
about what we are looking at today, 
but what are we being told today? An-
other rescue plan, only this time they 
call it the Inflation Reduction Act. The 
Penn Wharton Budget Model says this 
bill will, if anything, raise inflation in 
the first few years of this budget, with 
a small and significant negative effect 
later in this decade. That same model 
concludes that there is ‘‘low confidence 
that the legislation will have any im-
pact on inflation.’’ 
But it does have an impact on all of 
us and our economy. It does nothing to 
bring the economy out of stagnation 
and recession, but rather the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022 gives us higher 
taxes, more spending, higher prices, 
and an army of IRS agents. 
Let’s talk about the taxes first. 
Hundreds of billions of dollars are 
raised through taxes, around 350 to 400 
billion. 
There is a new book minimum tax on 
corporations. There is a new tax on 
stock buybacks. There is, believe this 
or not, a new tax on gasoline—on oil 
and gas production and refineries—at 
the very time when our President has 
shut down production of oil and gas on 
our interior and offshore and has 
stopped the Keystone XL Pipeline, ba-
sically freezing America’s production 
and driving us from a state of energy 
independence to a state of energy de-
pendence, where we have to ask our 
friends and often our enemies across 
the globe to increase their gas produc-
tion to help us deal with our prices at 
the pump. 
And this book minimum tax, every-
body in America knows that corpora-
tions don’t bear the burden of the taxes 
we put on them. Who does? Workers, 
consumers, and owners. 
A recent National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research study estimates that 
31 percent of these taxes will be borne 
by consumers via price hikes—price 
hikes at a time when we are dealing 
with record inflation. 
Thirty-eight percent is borne by 
workers by way of lower wages or less 
employment, and 31 percent is borne by 
owners. 
Now, my colleagues are very quick to 
say: Well, this is just rich people and 
rich companies that are tax cheaters. 
The 
owners 
of 
the 
corporations, 
though, are primarily people in Amer-
ica who have retired and are leaning on 
a pension or who have not yet retired 
or are trying to save money for their 
retirement by putting their money into 
401(k) programs or other investment 
programs. That is who bears the bur-
den of these taxes. 
We just asked the Joint Tax Com-
mittee to tell us who bears these bur-
dens? Who will bear the burden of these 
tax hikes? 
They told us, as the chart here 
shows, in 2023, that taxes will be in-
creased by $16.7 billion on American 
taxpayers earning less than $200,000. In 
2023, another 14.1 billion will come 
from 
taxpayers 
earning 
between 
$200,000 and $500,000. And by 2031, when 
the new green energy credits and sub-
sidies provide an even greater benefit 
to those in America with higher in-
comes, those earning below $400,000 are 
projected to bear as much as two-thirds 
of the burden of the additional tax rev-
enues collected in that year. 
That is what we are being offered as 
a solution to the crisis that we are now 
in in our economy. 
And as I will discuss later, the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office 
has recently confirmed that a signifi-
cant portion of the revenue that the 
IRS supersized funding they are claim-
ing will be coming from audits that 
they are going to be taking will come 
out of taxpayers earning less than 
$400,000. 
So in response to this data that we 
have been able to show about their 
very tax proposals in this bill, the 
Democrats, surprisingly, have claimed 
that this Joint Tax Committee anal-
ysis isn’t valid because it didn’t in-
clude the effects of their spending that 
they were putting into the bill. 
Now, that is a novel idea. It is OK to 
raise taxes, and it is OK to put more 
tax burden on people making more 
than $400,000 because we are going to be 
sending some subsidies to some of 
them. 
So we asked the Joint Tax Commis-
sion to include those subsidies in its 
analysis, which they did. 
The analysis they gave us back incor-
porated the ObamaCare subsidies and 
shows that the burdens of the proposed 
tax increases in the Democrats’ reck-
less bill will be so substantial and so 
widespread throughout all income cat-
egories—I 
repeat, 
all 
income 
cat-
egories—that no amount of temporary 
healthcare credits or even the subsidies 
that this bill gives for $80,000 luxury 
SUVs will overcome the tax increase 
burdens that will be overwhelmingly 
felt by lower and middle-income-class 
Americans. 
Few, if any, Americans will get a net 
reduction in the burden that they will 
bear from the taxes and subsidies pro-
vided in this bill. And for any that do, 
it will only be temporary. The vast ma-
jority will still bear the burden of 
these taxes. 
The book minimum tax does not 
close loopholes. You often hear that 
from my colleagues on the other side 
as well. It raises taxes on U.S. compa-
nies by hundreds of billions of dollars, 
and it would not prevent all companies 
from paying zero tax. Instead, it would 
let some of the companies preferred by 
the Democrats continue to avoid their

taxes by using not loopholes but legiti-
mate provisions for research and devel-
opment tax credits and other kinds of 
tax 
credits 
that 
are 
intended 
to 
incentivize the conduct of those com-
panies. 
The Joint Tax Committee has al-
ready estimated that half of the burden 
of the book minimum tax will fall on 
manufacturers. 
In other words—well, let me go into 
what 252 trade associations and cham-
bers of commerce from across the 
country said when they realized that 
close to half of this burden will fall on 
manufacturers. 
This is from those trade associations 
that jointly—252 of them—wrote to 
Congress: 
Enacting the proposed Corporate Book 
Minimum Tax would be the antithesis of 
sound tax policy and administration. Its in-
troduction would be neither simple nor ad-
ministrable and would pose a competitive 
disadvantage to U.S.-headquartered busi-
nesses while increasing the incidence of 
unrelieved double taxation. It would also 
have a detrimental effect on the quality of 
financial reporting. 
The Business Roundtable said: 
[T]he proposed book minimum tax would, 
among other things, suppress domestic in-
vestment— 
Remember that, ‘‘suppress domestic 
investment’’— 
when increased investment is needed to 
spur a strong recovery in our economy. This 
tax hike would also undermine the competi-
tiveness of America’s exporters. 
Even with a carve-out for accelerated 
appreciation, there remain many unre-
solved problems with the design and 
structure of this minimum tax that 
make it a poor revenue option. 
So let’s go to the next one that they 
raise: stock buybacks. 
Once again, my colleagues on the 
other side are quick to attack any 
company that does a stock buyback, 
saying that they are just trying to 
make owners of their stock who are 
rich tax cheaters even more wealthy. 
I have already explained that the 
owners of that stock are the vast ma-
jority of Americans who are retired or 
who are working for retirement or who 
are trying to invest a little bit to try 
to get ahead. 
Despite the claims that these are 
loopholes, they are doubling down on 
proposing a $74 billion tax on U.S. com-
panies. Democrats want to create a 
third layer of tax on American compa-
nies, which will have the harshest im-
pact on seniors and other savers. 
The Wall Street Journal in a recent 
editorial explained: 
Companies use buybacks to return cash to 
shareholders for which they don’t have a bet-
ter use. Shareholders who sell shares back to 
. . . [companies] can invest the proceeds 
elsewhere. That beats letting the cash sit on 
corporate books earning interest while CEOs 
get complacent or decide to buy a business 
they don’t really want or understand how to 
run. 
Buybacks aren’t tax free: Owners who sell 
shares back to the company realize a taxable 
gain. Any boost in the share price contrib-
utes to a higher taxable gain for remaining 
owners when they sell their shares in the fu-
ture. 
Why not pay dividends instead? Companies 
and shareholders might prefer buybacks in 
some instances, such as the company is dis-
bursing a one-time lump sum or shifting the 
balance of equity and debt on its books. For 
the economy overall, buybacks have the ef-
fect of distributing capital specifically to 
those owners who choose to participate be-
cause they believe they have a more produc-
tive use for it. Capital flows from companies 
that don’t need it to companies that do. 
Democrats are telling companies: If 
you return value to your retirees or to 
retirees in the country or if you return 
value to people’s investment in 401(k) 
plans or the pension plans, then you 
will pay a punitive tax. 
The majority of American households 
have direct or indirect ownership of 
corporate stock via pensions, 401(k) 
plans, or other saving vehicles. 
Here are some interesting statistics 
about the Americans who will bear the 
burden of this tax: 
Eighty to one hundred million Amer-
icans have a 401(k) plan, 46.4 million 
households have an individual retire-
ment account, and half of the Genera-
tion Zers and millennials are invested 
in stocks. 
Seniors are especially dependent on 
investment income. 
The Association of Mature American 
Citizens reports that 68 percent of 
workers between the ages of 55 and 64 
were active participants in a retire-
ment plan to save for their golden 
years and that, on average, 40 percent 
of seniors’ net worth is held in stocks 
and mutual funds invested over and 
above those retirement accounts. 
Companies also rely on investments 
by individuals and institutions like 
pension funds to finance their oper-
ations. 
Successful companies use this capital 
to generate profits, which are then 
used for expansion, for research and de-
velopment, for hiring and for benefits, 
and for investment in communities. 
Companies may also choose to pay 
down their debt or return excess funds 
to shareholders. 
Restricting stock buybacks could 
force companies to sit on cash or waste 
it on low-potential projects, both of 
which limit our economic growth and 
prosperity. 
The Tax Foundation points out: 
A large body of evidence supports the idea 
that companies generally only consider 
stock buybacks when they have exhausted 
their investment opportunities and met their 
other obligations, meaning it is residual cash 
flow that is used for buybacks. In fact, stock 
buybacks can supplement capital invest-
ments, as they can help reallocate capital 
from old, established firms to new and inno-
vative firms. 
This unvetted stock buybacks tax is 
a crippling tax that reduces retirement 
security for Americans. 
So let’s go to the next tax that they 
propose, and this one is the one that I 
said was just a little difficult to under-
stand—the superfund tax and methane 
fee. 
Now, I understand why they call it 
the superfund tax because it is a 16.4- 
percent increase on oil and gas produc-
tion in the United States. 
According to the Energy Information 
Agency, regular gasoline prices have 
risen $1.94 per gallon since President 
Biden was inaugurated, an increase of 
over 80 percent. Americans are still 
paying, on average, more than $4 a gal-
lon for gas, and many can still remem-
ber the $5-a-gallon gas. The price for 
utility gas service is up by almost 40 
percent. 
These prices occur because President 
Biden shut down domestic energy pro-
duction, including through permitting 
delays and canceling pipelines like the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. 
Now—again, unbelievably—the Presi-
dent’s Democrat allies in Congress are 
doubling down with a methane tax and 
higher royalties on petroleum, reim-
posing and increasing by nearly 70 per-
cent the Superfund tax on refiners of 
crude oil, importers of petroleum prod-
ucts, and crude oil exporters, costing 
almost $12 billion over 10 years that 
will ultimately be borne by American 
motorists. And Americans know that. 
In addition, higher taxes diminish 
the ability to improve domestic sup-
plies of oil by making capital invest-
ments cost prohibitive at a time when 
the U.S. has already lost 1 million bar-
rels a day of refining capacity com-
pared to before President Biden’s un-
wise restriction of fossil fuel produc-
tion in the United States. 
On the methane fee, the American 
Gas Association says: 
New fees or taxes on energy companies will 
raise costs for customers— 
Americans understand this. He con-
tinues: 
[C]reating a burden that will fall most 
heavily on lower-income Americans. . . . 
based on similar proposals introduced earlier 
this Congress, we estimate that the fee could 
amount to tens of billions of dollars annu-
ally. These major new costs most likely will 
result in higher bills for natural gas cus-
tomers, including families, small businesses, 
and power generators. 
Any increase in low-income households’ 
energy costs could prove devastating. 
The bottom line on taxes is that mil-
lions of Americans will bear the burden 
of these tax hikes. Some of my col-
leagues have claimed that those tax 
hikes are worth the supposed benefit. 
But let’s look at those benefits. 
Drug price reform is one they refer 
to. The largest source of supposed sav-
ings in the Democrats’ bill is a system 
of bureaucratic drug price controls 
that will lead to: higher launch prices, 
stifled growth, gutted domestic manu-
facturing jobs, and aiding foreign ad-
versaries like China; higher launch 
prices for new medications, triggering 
financial 
strain 
at 
the 
pharmacy 
counter, as confirmed by the Congres-
sional Budget Office; hundreds of thou-
sands of American job losses, particu-
larly 
in 
domestic 
manufacturing, 
which is already getting hit by the new 
book minimum tax, with some esti-
mates projecting as many as 800,000 job 
losses; a competitive edge for the Chi-
nese Communist Party, which has sin-
gled out biomedical innovation as a

pillar of its industrial policy strategy 
and could ultimately supplant the 
United 
States 
as 
the 
global 
life 
sciences 
leader, 
with 
a 
profound 
amount of national security implica-
tions; an unprecedented expansion of 
the DC Federal health bureaucracy, fi-
nanced with a staggering $3 billion in 
new administrative spending as the 
Federal Government takes even great-
er control over another segment of our 
healthcare economy. 
This bureaucracy would also have un-
bridled new government price-setting 
authorities with permanent prohibi-
tions on even judicial and administra-
tive review and with initial implemen-
tation shielded from basic notice-and- 
comment 
rulemaking 
requirements; 
fewer new treatments and cures, with 
the University of Chicago analysis esti-
mating 135 fewer new drugs approved 
between now and 2039, resulting from 
an 18.5 percent reduction in innovative 
research and development. 
There would be less funding for can-
cer R&D. Today, nearly 50 percent of 
the FDA pipeline is comprised of new 
cancer treatments. However, according 
to the same economists at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, the drug price controls 
would reduce funding for cancer R&D 
by nearly $18.1 billion, over 9 times the 
amount of funding proposed for Presi-
dent 
Biden’s 
Cancer 
Moonshot—so 
much for the President’s Cancer Moon-
shot. 
There would be dangerous new mech-
anisms for compelling total compliance 
with Federal Government mandates, 
with potential applications across all 
sectors of the economy, including: an 
escalating noncompliance penalty of 
up to 95 percent on all gross sales lev-
ied every day for failure to meet any 
terms of the government’s price-set-
ting program—negotiation in name 
only—rendering any new Federal man-
date, however sweeping, an offer you 
can’t refuse. Even late paperwork 
would trigger this crippling, cata-
strophic penalty, which has a tax-ex-
clusive rate of up to 1,900 percent. It is 
negotiation in name only. 
As a messaging gimmick, the Demo-
crats have framed their government 
price-setting 
program 
as 
‘‘negotia-
tion,’’ but their legislation tells a far 
different story. Under their proposed 
program, the Secretary has absolute, 
unilateral, 
uninhibited 
price-setting 
authority—with no floor—enabling a 
price of $1 for even the most innovative 
new drugs. Manufacturers have no 
choice but to comply and to provide in-
definite access to their products at the 
Secretary-dictated price, regardless of 
how unfair. They cannot walk away 
from the negotiating table or withdraw 
selected products from the Medicare 
market, even if the Secretary sets an 
economically untenable price, strip-
ping even small businesses of any le-
verage. 
Judicial and administrative review of 
key decisions, including the price set-
ting itself, are permanently prohibited. 
The bill completely disregards the 
rest of the prescription drug supply 
chain, targeting manufacturers while 
doing nothing to address other key 
players or to improve oversight and 
transparency. 
There is a better way. It is called the 
Lower Costs, More Cures Act. Senate 
Republicans have developed a common-
sense alternative, based on more than 
two dozen solutions, aimed at pro-
viding relief at the pharmacy counter 
while ensuring long-term access to life-
saving new treatments and cures. 
Among other provisions—virtually 
all of which are based on proposals 
with bipartisan support—the Lower 
Costs, More Cures Act would reform 
the Part D benefit to reduce seniors’ 
cost-sharing burden and incentivize 
plans to negotiate the best deals pos-
sible for enrollees. It would create a 
hard cap on the annual out-of-pocket 
spending for all seniors under Medicare 
Part D. It would increase Part D plan 
choices for seniors by enabling spon-
sors to offer additional plans with in-
centives for options that pass a greater 
share of the discounts directly to their 
beneficiaries at the pharmacy counter. 
It 
would 
permanently 
extend 
a 
Trump administration program pro-
viding Part D enrollees with access to 
plan options that cap out-of-pocket 
monthly insulin costs at $35 or less. 
It would permanently allow high-de-
ductible 
health 
plans 
to 
offer 
predeductible coverage for preventive 
services, including insulin. 
It would establish a chief pharma-
ceutical negotiator to combat foreign 
freeloading, ensuring the best trade 
deals achievable for American con-
sumers and job creators. 
It would strengthen consumer-ori-
ented oversight through more useful 
cost comparison tools, price trans-
parency measures, and robust report-
ing 
requirements 
for 
stakeholders 
across the drug supply chain, including 
pharmacy benefit managers. 
It would facilitate value-based ar-
rangements where private and public 
sector payers can pay based on patient 
outcomes, driving better results for pa-
tients at a lower cost. And it would re-
structure payments for drugs adminis-
tered in the doctor’s office or hospital 
outpatient department to encourage 
physicians 
to 
deliver 
cost-effective 
treatment options when clinically ap-
propriate. 
These are the kinds of solutions that 
our prescription drug pricing system 
requires, not an arbitrary and offensive 
Federal price-fixing program. 
Now, let’s move on, finally, to the 
IRS funding for an army of auditors. 
This bill proposes $80 billion in new 
spending in mandatory appropriations 
to the IRS. 
Let me give that a little perspective. 
The annual budget of the IRS is only 
about $12.6 billion. So it is nearly six 
times the annual budget of the current 
IRS. Of this, $45.6 billion is for enforce-
ment purposes. That is more than 57 
percent—almost 60 percent of this $80 
billion is for enforcement purposes— 
and I will get to that in a minute—$25.3 
billion for operations and support; only 
$4.8 billion for improving their business 
systems and bringing themselves into 
the 21st century with their technology 
so they can communicate with tax-
payers; and only $3.2 billion for tax-
payer services. 
Some estimate that this part of the 
chart—the $46 billion for an army of 
auditors—will allow us to hire as many 
as 87,000 new auditors. That would 
make the IRS one of the largest Fed-
eral Agencies—larger than the Pen-
tagon, larger than the State Depart-
ment, larger than the FBI, and larger 
than the Border Patrol—all of them 
combined. 
According to the Congressional Re-
search Service, the Democrats’ reck-
less IRS funding increase would raise 
enforcement funding by nearly 70 per-
cent above what the IRS is currently 
projected to get. Increased audits for 
the middle-class, for small businesses, 
and those making less than $400,000 are 
inevitable and unavoidable under this 
act. 
How will this money be used? Well, 
interestingly, the White House—after 
we started pointing this out, the White 
House and even the IRS Commissioner 
have said they won’t use all this money 
for auditing people who make less than 
$400,000. And my colleagues just con-
tinue to say they won’t do it. 
Multiple studies show, however, that 
in order to raise the money they are re-
quiring to be raised under this bill 
from audits—around $200 billion of 
more tax revenue from Americans by 
auditing them—they have nowhere else 
to look. 
Last year, the IRS announced that it 
plans to ramp up audits of small busi-
nesses by 50 percent this year. Why did 
they announce that? Because that is 
where they need to look to collect all 
of this new tax revenue that they want 
to get. So I asked the nonpartisan 
Joint Tax Committee to estimate 
where most of this tax gap lies. Where 
is this trillion dollars of tax gap that 
my colleagues on the other side say is 
all coming from ‘‘big’’ tax cheats? The 
IRS looked at the data and determined 
that out of all the revenue projected to 
be raised from underreported income, 
40 to 57 percent could come from tax-
payers making $50,000 or less; 65 to 78 
percent could come from taxpayers 
making $100,000 or less; and 78 to 90 per-
cent could come from those making 
less than $200,000. Only around 4 to 9 
percent could come from those making 
over $500,000. That is what the data 
shows. 
That is why the IRS announced a 50- 
percent increase in audits for small 
businesses, and that is why it is impos-
sible for the Democrats’ claims that 
they want to not have audits of people 
under $400,000 cannot be honored. 
You know, in their bill in response to 
this criticism, they included a sentence 
that said, Nothing in this bill is ‘‘in-
tended’’—focus on that word—nothing 
in this bill is intended to increase taxes 
on those making less than $400,000.

August 6, 2022 
Why did they use the word ‘‘in-
tended’’? Because they know that that 
is not what they want to have happen, 
but it is what will have to happen, and 
they are not willing to use a stronger 
word. 
I have asked them—and I will ask 
them in an amendment on this floor— 
to say that none of this money can be 
used to audit taxpayers making less 
than $400,000 a year. Let’s see how they 
vote on that amendment. 
Why couldn’t they just say that this 
money ‘‘shall not’’ increase taxes on 
people making under $400,000 per year? 
Why couldn’t they say that these funds 
‘‘cannot’’ be utilized to audit taxpayers 
making less than $400,000 per year? Be-
cause they know they can’t say that 
and claim the amount of revenue that 
they want to spend unless they audit 
those making less than $400,000 per 
year. The fact is, the tax cap isn’t just 
millionaires or billionaires or oligarchs 
or whatever the term of the attack is 
today. Referring to all tax gaps and 
misreporting—that everybody who has 
not accurately reported their income is 
a ‘‘tax cheat’’—is misdirection. It calls 
all of these people who make less than 
$400,000 who are simply having trouble 
with this complex Internal Revenue 
Code a tax cheat. That is unfair. 
We have examined the IRS’s own 
data on how successful it is in having 
the courts sustain—sustain its claims 
that these folks in the $400,000-or-less 
category and other categories are 
cheating on their taxes. 
Over the past 20 years, the IRS has 
had a less than 47-percent success rate 
and a less than 45-percent success rate 
over the last 10 years. In other words, 
the IRS more often asserts that these 
deficiencies exist than the courts agree 
with. That is hardly evidence for a 
multitude of tax cheats, but it is firm 
evidence that innocent taxpayers are 
often subjected to unnecessary and in-
appropriate scrutiny. We can be sure 
they will be with 87,000 new auditors— 
again, making the IRS larger than all 
of those other Agencies that I talked 
about. 
By the way, folks may remember just 
a short time back when the proposal 
also included language that would let 
the IRS get into the bank accounts and 
monitor the transactions of the depos-
its and withdrawals of all Americans. 
Well, let me say it better—all Ameri-
cans who had more than $10,000 worth 
of transactions in a year, which is, es-
sentially, almost all Americans. Now, 
admittedly, that language isn’t in this 
bill yet, but the broad authority that is 
given to the Internal Revenue Service 
with this $80 billion of supersizing will 
undoubtedly result in rules and regula-
tions issued by the IRS to achieve that 
objective. They just knew that they 
couldn’t put it in statute because they 
would be rejected immediately by the 
American people. 
I encourage the American people to 
see past this and to reject this legisla-
tion. It is too many taxes, too much 
spending, and too big of a burden on 
the American people across all income 
categories. We don’t want to supersize 
our Internal Revenue Service, and—go 
back to that very first statistic I gave 
you—it is not even going to have a sta-
tistically significant impact on infla-
tion. If anything, the taxes will drive 
prices up. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
reject this reckless bill. 
With that, I yield my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
yield myself 20 minutes from the bill 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
Hans Christian Andersen, in 1837, wrote 
a story about group think. It is called 
‘‘The Emperor’s New Clothes.’’ It be-
gins with a leader who really loved his 
clothes. Some unsavory characters saw 
that, and they set up a weaving loom 
to make the finest clothes in the land, 
but they were actually weaving just 
air; there was nothing to it. The catch 
was they had sold the story that, if you 
can’t see what they are weaving, it 
must be that you are just not wise. 
So the Emperor sends a couple of his 
advisers to go check out the weaving to 
see what it looks like. They see, obvi-
ously, nothing because there is nothing 
there, and they all declare ‘‘Oh, it is 
beautiful; it is lovely’’ because they 
don’t want to be seen as unwise. 
Then it ends up with the Emperor 
preparing for a big parade, and that is 
where I pick up the story. Let me read 
to you from Hans Christian Andersen, 
from 1837, when he tries on the ‘‘new 
clothes.’’ 
These scoundrels, these unsavory 
characters who had sold him this said: 
‘‘How well Your Majesty’s new clothes 
look. Aren’t they becoming!’’ 
The advisers all chirped in. He heard on all 
sides, ‘‘That pattern, so perfect! Those col-
ors, so suitable! It is a magnificent outfit.’’ 
Then the minister of public processions an-
nounced: ‘‘Your Majesty’s canopy is waiting 
outside.’’ 
‘‘Well, I’m supposed to be ready,’’ the Em-
peror said, and turned again for one last look 
in the mirror. ‘‘It is a remarkable fit, isn’t 
it?’’ He seemed to regard his costume with 
the greatest interest. 
The noblemen who were to carry his train 
stooped low and reached for the floor as if 
they were picking up his mantle. Then they 
pretended to lift and hold it high. They 
didn’t dare admit they had nothing to hold. 
So off went the Emperor in procession 
under his splendid canopy. Everyone in the 
streets and the windows said, ‘‘Oh, how fine 
are the Emperor’s new clothes! Don’t they fit 
him to perfection? And see his long train!’’ 
Nobody would confess that he couldn’t see 
anything, for that would prove him either 
unfit for his position, or a fool. No costume 
the Emperor had worn before was ever such 
a complete success. 
‘‘But he hasn’t got anything on,’’ a little 
child said. 
‘‘Did you ever hear such innocent prattle?’’ 
said its father. And one person whispered to 
another what the child had said, ‘‘He hasn’t 
anything on. A child says he hasn’t anything 
on.’’ 
‘‘But he hasn’t got anything on!’’ the 
whole town cried out at last. 
The Emperor shivered, for he suspected 
they were right. But he thought, ‘‘This pro-
cession has got to go on.’’ So he walked more 
proudly than ever, as his noblemen held high 
the train that wasn’t there at all. 
When the facts come out, it is hard 
sometimes to admit you are on display, 
that the bill actually doesn’t do what 
the title says it is supposed to do. This 
time, the bill is called the Inflation Re-
duction Act. They say it is designed to 
be able to lower inflation and to reduce 
the deficit except that now it has actu-
ally been scored. It doesn’t actually re-
duce inflation, and deficit reduction is 
as invisible as the Emperor’s new 
clothes. 
The score for inflation stated in the 
public scoring that ‘‘the impact on in-
flation is statistically indistinguish-
able from zero.’’ 
The CBO scored the bill and said it 
‘‘would have a negligible effect on in-
flation.’’ 
Remember, this is the bill titled: the 
‘‘Inflation Reduction Act.’’ The score 
on the deficit end, after many on the 
other side of the aisle here have said it 
would have $300 billion in deficit reduc-
tion, it is less than a billion. But wait, 
there is more to the story on even that 
$100 billion. 
More than 200 economists wrote a 
letter to Senator SCHUMER detailing 
how this bill will not reduce inflation 
nor reduce the deficit. Taxing more and 
spending more will only make the 
problem worse. 
They closed by saying this state-
ment: 
The bill deficit reduction is likely to prove 
illusionary due to implausible spending 
phase-outs. 
In summary, we agree with the urgent 
need to reduce inflation, but the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022 is a misleading label 
applied to a bill that would likely achieve 
the exact opposite effect. 
What they said was, the Emperor has 
no clothes. It doesn’t really reduce in-
flation. At some point, the emperor has 
to make a decision: Am I going to keep 
parading through the streets, when ev-
eryone knows the Inflation Reduction 
Act doesn’t reduce inflation or am I 
going to head back and fix it? 
Let me start with just the plan that 
is in this bill. 
Here is the bill. It is titled: The ‘‘In-
flation Reduction Act of 2022.’’ So the 
plan my Democratic colleagues have 
laid out—let me just give you a couple 
of details in the plan to reduce infla-
tion in the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022. 
Here is one: Up to $4 billion has been 
allocated to study cow burping and 
their production of methane. I am sure 
that that is going to bring down the 
price of beef right away. As I have 
heard, even on the floor today, this is 
going to bring down the prices at the 
grocery store by having up to $4 billion 
allocated to study cow burping. 
It adds $2 billion in construction 
grants to improve walkability in con-
text-sensitive projects. No one seems 
to know what the words ‘‘context-sen-
sitive projects’’ even mean or how $2

billion in construction to improve 
walkability will bring down inflation. 
There is $3 billion for environmental 
justice block grants to facilitate work-
shops—workshops—to bring down infla-
tion. Aren’t you confident that the 
price of eggs and bread will go down 
after $3 billion is spent on environ-
mental justice workshops? 
There is $17 million for consumer-re-
lated education and partnerships to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions. By the 
way, that is not reducing. Those are 
partnerships to discuss reducing. 
There is a brandnew tax credit for 
Elon Musk that is in this, though. I am 
sure that it will bring down inflation. 
Tesla has used up all of its credits for 
its electric vehicles so this bill renews 
it and does a special perk for Tesla to 
give them an unlimited number of new 
tax credits. I am sure Elon Musk is 
thrilled about his unlimited new tax 
credits to him, and I am sure all of our 
prices will go down based on Elon 
Musk’s 
new 
multibillion-dollar 
tax 
credit that he gets. Again, the bill is 
the Inflation Reduction Act. 
There is a new fee on methane that 
will raise the price of natural gas, 
which has been estimated to raise the 
price of our natural gas to the con-
sumer by 17 percent—a 17-percent in-
crease on our natural gas. Now, let me 
remind you that this is the Inflation 
Reduction Act that will increase the 
price of our heating, of our cooking, 
and of our energy production—17 per-
cent. 
There is a new tax on imported oil 
and new fees on domestic oil produced 
on Federal lands. 
There are new inspection fees and 
owners’ fees on pipelines. I do not un-
derstand how new fees and new taxes 
on oil and gas are supposed to lower 
the price of natural gas and of gasoline, 
but that is what is being declared in 
the Inflation Reduction Act. If only we 
had more taxes on oil, gas, and natural 
gas, then prices would somehow magi-
cally go down. 
As has been mentioned multiple 
times on the floor, this Inflation Re-
duction Act hires more than 80,000 new 
IRS auditors, with no limit on whom 
they can audit. If you thought that 
there would be a limit to those people 
making $40,000 or more on being au-
dited, you were wrong. Now, that could 
have been in this bill, but they chose 
not to put it in this bill. There are no 
guardrails for who can be audited by 
the IRS with billions of dollars being 
allocated to new IRS agents. Every sin-
gle American in every income bracket, 
every small business, and every large 
company—everyone—is going to expe-
rience new IRS audits in the days 
ahead. 
Remember this night. Remember this 
night. In the next 10 years, when you 
get an IRS audit, it was the Democrats 
in this body who sent the IRS to your 
house. So keep your records because 
IRS audits are about to dramatically 
go up due to the gift of the Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
Maybe this bill should instead be 
called the CPA Hiring Act because I as-
sume millions of taxpayers who strug-
gle under our complicated Tax Code al-
ready will now have to hire a CPA 
knowing their chances of being audited 
are greatly increasing now. They know 
the complicated rules of the IRS. Most 
taxpayers I talk to submit their tax 
forms every year and hope they get it 
right because it is so complicated, but 
because of this night and this vote, 
there will be auditors coming after you 
to make sure that you got it right. 
The Democrats, in the days ahead, 
when the IRS comes to this body for a 
hearing, will be asking them: Did they 
pull in additional money based on the 
audits they gave them? They are not 
telling you this, but they assume the 
IRS will collect $200 billion more once 
they give them these new auditors. 
You can be assured that that is going 
to be a metric that is going to be 
checked in the days ahead. The IRS 
will suddenly be like the smalltown po-
lice force that has a quota for writing 
tickets on the highway through their 
small town in order to help pay for the 
new city hall. If you have to pay for 
city hall, you need to write more tick-
ets on the highway. It is about to be 
that way with the IRS. They need to 
audit more and go get more because we 
gave you more people. 
Remember, this is the Inflation Re-
duction Act. I have yet to figure out 
how Americans getting more audits re-
duces inflation, but as has been adver-
tised, this is going to bring down the 
cost of groceries, and this is going to 
bring down the cost of gas by more peo-
ple getting audited by the IRS. 
One of the other interesting plans in 
this bill to reduce inflation is to force 
more Americans to join a union. Now, 
I have to tell you that I have no angst 
against unions. Unions are a choice. 
Those individuals should be able to 
choose to join a union and be a part of 
collective bargaining as an American 
right and privilege. 
Let me say this: 10.3 percent of the 
American workforce is union—10.3 per-
cent. In the energy portion of this bill, 
which is billions and billions and bil-
lions of dollars, the unions get billions 
of dollars, and nonunion workers get 
nothing. So, if you work in the energy 
sector right now and if you are not a 
union employee, you are about to get 
cut out because the way this bill is 
written it gives Federal payouts to 
companies that use union laborers, 
which will make nonunion energy com-
panies uncompetitive and will force 
them out of business or force them to 
unionize. 
Quite frankly, this bill should be 
called the Mandatory Union Bill of 
2022, not the Inflation Reduction Act, 
because I am not sure how forcing 
more people into a union reduces infla-
tion, but that is a major portion of this 
bill. 
I am confident the union bosses 
across the country are thrilled to fi-
nally see a return on their investments 
since they gave heavily to Democrats 
in 2022 to get them elected, and this is 
their payoff. There will no longer be 
10.3 percent of workers in unions. This 
is going to force more companies to 
have to unionize or they will not be 
able to survive because of the Federal 
credits that only go to companies that 
hire union labor. Does forced unioniza-
tion sound like the solution to infla-
tion reduction to you? It does to appar-
ently half this body. 
It creates a subsidy in health insur-
ance to be announced right before the 
fall elections this fall. And it is not for 
those who are in poverty. Those who 
are in poverty, all the way up to 400 
percent 
of 
poverty, 
already 
get 
healthcare subsidies. Oh, no, this is not 
for those folks at the poverty level—200 
percent, 300 percent, or 400 percent of 
poverty; this is a family of four making 
$200,000 who will get this healthcare 
subsidy. 
What do the economists think will 
happen with this new subsidy? They be-
lieve employers will drop their health 
insurance and will push employees 
under the government Affordable Care 
Act policies and will shift more and 
more people onto the government rolls. 
Remember, this is the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act. 
As homelessness increases across the 
Nation right now, the bill adds $1 bil-
lion into HUD for zero emissions elec-
tricity generation in affordable hous-
ing. That is what it is called, zero 
emissions electricity generation in af-
fordable housing. It is not about in-
creasing access to housing for those 
who are homeless; it is solar panels in 
public housing. I am confident the peo-
ple who are living on the street, trying 
to survive a 9-percent inflation rate, 
are really not hoping that they can 
find someplace with a solar panel, but 
that is what is in the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act of 2022, solar panels in public 
housing. That is their solution to solv-
ing inflation. 
While many of us have been pushing 
back hard to block China from buying 
more land in the United States, this 
bill actually gives ag subsidies to land 
owners regardless of who is the owner 
of the land. They don’t have to be a 
U.S. citizen. They don’t have to be 
American ownership. We are literally 
opening up that to owners of land to be 
able to get access to it. 
I have also heard over and over again 
that there are no new taxes in the In-
flation Reduction Act. I have heard 
that in national media from my Demo-
cratic colleagues saying it over and 
over again and on this floor. Well, it 
seems to be true. If you are a green en-
ergy company, that is true; there are 
no new taxes for you. They will have 
huge tax breaks. And while there is a 
push for everyone to have a 15-percent 
minimum tax, that is not exactly true 
for those folks who are in these green 
energy companies that are major Dem-
ocrat donors. They will not have that 
same minimum tax standard. 
But the Tax Foundation found this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4159 
August 6, 2022 
On average, tax filers in every quintile 
would experience a drop in after-tax in-
comes. 
Let me run that past you again. ‘‘On 
average, tax filers in every quintile 
would experience a drop in after-tax in-
comes’’ if this bill passes. That means 
everyone in the country, under $400,000 
and over $400,000 a year—everyone has 
a drop in after-tax income. 
One of the new taxes that was just 
added into the bill today is the stock 
buyback tax. This is to punish compa-
nies that are listed on our stock ex-
changes that buy back stocks to raise 
the value of stock. Now, they buy back 
stock so that the stock value goes up. 
They are putting a tax on them to be 
able to punish them to try to prevent 
them from doing this. They make it 
sound like they are hitting the big, fat 
cat corporate CEOs and the guys on 
Wall Street, keeping the value of their 
stock lower. They are going to really 
stick it to the man—except 60 million 
Americans are invested in a 401(k) plan 
for their retirement. Sixty million. 
The largest owners of stocks in Amer-
ica are retirement plans, insurance 
companies, 
and 
nonprofits. 
Google 
‘‘largest owners of stocks.’’ So the peo-
ple who will be hurt the most in this 
new plan to drive down the stock mar-
ket prices are nonprofits, insurance 
companies, 
and 
retirement 
plans. 
Fifty-eight percent of Americans own 
some kind of stock. 
This is a tax directly and delib-
erately designed to keep the price of 
individual stocks from going up. Sure, 
that is going to hurt CEOs who own 
their own stock, but it is also going to 
hurt everyday Americans who just own 
stock on their own, and it is going to 
hurt all of those retirement plans. But 
they seem not to care whom they hurt 
in this as long as they can also hurt 
CEOs. Driving down the stock market 
will, I guess, reduce inflation, if that is 
their plan in their Inflation Reduction 
Act, is to drive stock prices lower for 
retirees and nonprofits and individual 
investors. 
Another new tax that was added 
today is a 15-percent minimum tax on 
businesses that are funded by private 
equity. I have to tell you, this one 
shocked even me when it got slipped in 
today. Most companies that are funded 
by private money are small businesses, 
research companies, small manufac-
turing companies. This adds a new 15- 
percent tax on those small businesses. 
Basically, if you are owned by pri-
vate money or funded by private 
money separate from the owner itself, 
you are considered a subsidiary, and so 
you get this big tax laid on you. 
Let me give you an example of this. 
I know directly a company in Okla-
homa that is a small manufacturing 
company. They are funded by private 
outside money. During COVID, my 
Democrat colleagues had the same ven-
detta against manufacturing that was 
funded by private equity. This par-
ticular company, unlike every other 
company across the country during 
COVID, could not get access to the 
Paycheck Protection Program because 
Democrats said: If you are funded by 
private outside money, then we are not 
going to get you access to that because 
you are in evil private equity areas— 
even though they are vastly small busi-
nesses. 
This particular manufacturing com-
pany in Oklahoma produces valves. 
This valve company had hundreds of 
employees before COVID. Once COVID 
happened and business dropped off im-
mediately, because they couldn’t get 
access to the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram like every other small business, 
they laid off hundreds of workers. 
Those 
workers 
weren’t 
rich 
folks. 
Those were folks turning a wrench and 
making a great product that a lot of 
people wanted. They got laid off simply 
because of how they were funded. 
Now my Democratic colleagues want 
to jump right on top of them at the end 
of COVID, as the company is finally 
starting to come back and they are hir-
ing 
people 
back, 
to 
now 
slap 
a 
brandnew tax on top of them that no 
one has discussed, no one has evalu-
ated, and no hearings have occurred on 
it to determine how wide and how 
broad this will be. Literally, the own-
ers of this company will wake up to-
morrow morning, because in the middle 
of the night, a new tax got added onto 
them right at the tail end of COVID 
simply because my Democratic col-
leagues don’t like any company—re-
gardless of what they do, regardless of 
the workers who actually work there, 
they don’t like how they are funded 
through private individuals who fund 
them. 
This bill doesn’t lower inflation. I 
listed a lot of things. Can a single 
American go: Oh, that will take down 
inflation; that will work. None of those 
things take down inflation. 
It also doesn’t reduce the deficit. 
Brace yourself for this. Their plan for 
reducing the deficit is not doing pro-
grams they were already not going to 
do. That is their plan. That is the def-
icit reduction. 
Let me give you an example of this. 
Let’s 
say 
you 
are 
going 
through 
Walmart, shopping, and you are with 
your shopping cart. You step aside to 
be able to get something off the shelf, 
and when you turn back around, some-
body has stuck in your basket a big 
bag of frozen brussels sprouts. Now, 
you didn’t put them in there; somebody 
else put them in there. 
As you go through the aisle, you look 
down and you see this big bag of brus-
sels sprouts. I don’t know about you, I 
don’t want frozen brussels sprouts. 
Maybe some of you love those. Great. 
But if somebody slipped a bag of frozen 
brussels sprouts into my cart, I would 
put it back. I would put that away and 
say: No, I am not going to buy that. 
Somebody else put that in my cart. 
Here is what I wouldn’t say. I 
wouldn’t say: Somebody put a bag of 
frozen brussels sprouts in my cart. I 
am going to put it back on the shelf. 
That is deficit reduction in my cart. I 
wouldn’t say that. 
Here is what I mean by that. During 
the end of the Trump administration, 
they laid the groundwork for seniors to 
get a rebate at the pharmacy counter 
for Medicare prescriptions to make 
sure that every senior got a discount at 
the pharmacy counter. That was the 
plan. That is what the Trump adminis-
tration put in place. 
When the Biden administration came 
in, they didn’t like that plan to give 
discounts to seniors at the pharmacy 
counter, so they set that plan aside and 
said: We are not going to do that. In-
stead, they have come up with this new 
plan that I will explain in just a sec-
ond. But they are saying that because 
they didn’t do the plan that Trump was 
planning to do, because they didn’t do 
that plan, that is $100 billion in savings 
by not buying what they never in-
tended to buy, ever. 
Let me just tell you, if you don’t buy 
the brussels sprouts, you just don’t 
have the brussels sprouts, but you are 
not saving the money from that. You 
just didn’t get them. That is not real 
savings. So when they say it is deficit 
reduction, it is because they are not 
doing what they never said they were 
going to do, and now they are magi-
cally calling it deficit reduction. That 
is not real reduction of the deficit; that 
is a budget gimmick in Washington, 
DC—a huge budget gimmick. Can I just 
say, the Emperor has no clothes. It is 
not real. 
In the place of this rebate rule, in its 
place, they have created a real method 
of price controls for some drugs. And it 
is not price negotiations; it is price 
controls. They are spending $3 billion 
to set up a system for the government 
to be able to select prices on one of the 
most used drugs in America. 
By the way, it starts in 2026, is when 
this starts. I have heard some people 
on the floor say: We are going to have 
lower prices right away. This plan 
starts in 2026. It wouldn’t actually af-
fect anyone’s pharmaceuticals until 
2027. So if you are planning on a reduc-
tion in prices, it is not coming soon; it 
is 5 years away, if there is a price de-
crease at all. 
The way it is set up is the President, 
whoever that may be 5 years from now, 
will have a new authority not to nego-
tiate prices in the next 10 years. It is 
not a negotiation, it is setting the 
price, because if you disagree with the 
next President, whoever the next Presi-
dent is, and what they set on the price, 
they can raise the taxes on your com-
pany 95 percent. So if you disagree 
with the price that they pick, whoever 
the next President is, what they pick 
for the price, then your company gets 
hit with a 95-percent tax. How does 
that sound for government sheer power 
over a company, to crush whoever they 
choose? That is how this is set up. You 
don’t follow what I say, we will crush 
your company. 
What does that mean for the future? 
Drug companies will have new incen-
tives to not use existing drugs for new

treatments because here is how it typi-
cally works: If a cancer drug works for 
lung cancer, then they start experi-
menting with other types of cancer to 
see if it works on those. But in this 
system the Democrats are setting up, if 
a drug works for lung cancer, they 
have a disincentive to try it on other 
cancers because if the drug gets too 
used, then it falls into this new nego-
tiation category. So the incentive for 
the drug companies is not to try new 
ways of using this drug for fear of get-
ting too big. 
Can I tell you what this looks like in 
real life? I have a friend at home whose 
wife has pancreatic cancer, and they 
are desperately trying every treatment 
and trying to get into every clinical 
trial they can get into, desperately. 
They are praying, and they are work-
ing, and he is being an awesome hus-
band, and she is being a tough warrior 
going through nausea and pretty awful 
treatments. They are trying to get into 
clinical trials, which is already hard. 
This bill will make it even harder be-
cause existing cancer drugs will have a 
disincentive to test out new ways to be 
able to serve their cancer. Thank you 
very much to my Democratic col-
leagues who are reducing the number 
of cancer cures for the future. How 
does that cure inflation in the Inflation 
Reduction Act? 
There is also a special little feature 
in it, in the way the drug piece is set 
up, that it incentivizes more IV drugs 
and fewer oral drugs because IV drugs 
get more time and oral drugs get less 
time. So the incentive is to set up IV 
drugs instead—for the drug companies. 
So for all of us who would prefer tak-
ing a pill than taking a drug intra-
venously, tough luck. Democrats prefer 
IV drugs to oral drugs. So, in the fu-
ture, when you are taking an IV in-
stead of an oral medication, it is be-
cause of the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022. 
Can I just remind everyone that 
Medicare has insolvency in 6 years— 
2028. This Inflation Reduction Act 
takes the savings from this new pre-
scription plan from Medicare and takes 
it out of Medicare. It doesn’t stabilize 
Medicare, which is going insolvent in 6 
years. It takes it out of Medicare and 
moves it over to the Affordable Care 
Act subsidies. 
It literally takes money designed for 
76-year-olds on a fixed income and 
gives them to 26-year-olds and their 
family making $200,000 a year. That is 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. By 
the way, did I mention, again, that 
those subsidies land right before the 
election this fall? 
This bill is three-quarters of a tril-
lion dollars that not a single person in 
this Chamber has read—755 pages of 
it—that came out a few hours ago. The 
media, which also hasn’t read this bill, 
continues to be able to talk about what 
a great plan it is for inflation reduc-
tion. They continue to praise the bill, 
though they have read the same things: 
It doesn’t reduce inflation; it doesn’t 
reduce the deficit. 
They have joined in the chorus talk-
ing about the beauty of the emperor’s 
new clothes. I am willing to say what a 
lot of people in this room know in their 
gut but they are afraid to say. It 
doesn’t reduce inflation. It doesn’t re-
duce the deficit. The emperor has no 
clothes. 
Let’s reject this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. I yield myself 11 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I got a 
chance to go home. I had some close 
family friends who had a loss in their 
family over the last few days. I wanted 
to go back and see them. 
I get this email at 3 a.m.—I didn’t see 
it until 5 a.m.—that my 8 a.m. flight 
was canceled. So I had trouble getting 
here this morning. I was finally able to 
get here in time for the vote we took 
just a few hours ago, but I didn’t get 
here for the first two. 
So I had a chance that morning to do 
two things. First, I had a chance to 
take my son to football practice. It is 
that glorious time of year when high 
school football is going. Then the other 
thing I had a chance to do is I had a 
chance to go to a Cuban bakery that is 
close to my house. I don’t get to go 
often, but when I do go, especially on 
weekends, I look for one of these little 
corners and just sit there. And I really 
like to go because I get to hear people 
talking—people who live on planet 
Earth, not people who are here in poli-
tics and in the bubble that is Wash-
ington. 
And you get to hear people talk. And 
one of the first things I heard today is 
about two ladies who were in line, and 
they were talking about how difficult 
it had become. You know, it is back-to- 
school shopping time, and even with 
the tax-free holiday week that we had 
in Florida, I could hear them talking 
about how much more expensive it was 
going to be this year to buy and how 
the list was longer and everything cost 
more—like pencils, all the stuff. I 
couldn’t hear everything. I didn’t want 
to entirely eavesdrop, but I could hear 
what they were talking about. 
A few minutes later, these two guys 
come in. It was like: Hey, are you tak-
ing the boat out today? 
No, I am not taking the boat out. I 
can’t take my kids out. The gas is too 
expensive. It is crazy to fill it up. It is 
twice what it used to be for the boat— 
x, y, and z. 
A few minutes later, someone else 
came by who was talking about the re-
ports on the news. We have a massive 
migration crisis which impacts the 
whole country, not just the land bor-
der. But we had this weekend, I think, 
six or eight Border Patrol engagements 
in the Florida Keys, people getting on 
rafts and leaving and coming there— 
maybe two more today. 
And it struck me as I am sitting 
there—and I have been reminded of this 
every time I go home, but it really 
struck me before I came here today 
that we like to talk a lot about how di-
vided politics is in America. And it is. 
It is very polarized. But I think we 
make a huge mistake when we think it 
is as simple as what normal political 
divisions are in this country, which is 
between Republicans and Democrats or 
between the left and the right. 
The polarization in American poli-
tics, the division—the sharpest division 
in American politics today—is between 
the priorities of millions and millions 
of people who live paycheck to pay-
check, the working-class heroes of our 
country that we have always bragged 
about, have always looked up to, that 
we all recognize make us different than 
the rest of the world—between the 
things that matter to them and what 
the people that run this place—and I 
don’t just mean the Senate but the 
Federal Government and politics in 
general—are focused on. 
There is a universe of difference be-
tween the stuff we spend time voting 
on and talking about and arguing 
about in politics and in this place and 
what people are worried about on a 
daily basis. I know a lot of you think 
that everyone is glued to their TV and 
Twitter watching everything we are 
doing here tonight. They are not. They 
might know something is going on to-
night—maybe—but most people are 
worried about their everyday life. 
What they expect is that we would be 
here—I don’t know—working on the 
things that matter to them. I am tell-
ing you that what the people, by the 
millions, registered to both political 
parties—people who voted for Biden, 
people who voted for Trump—I am tell-
ing you, what they are worried about is 
the fact that the streets in many cities 
in this country have been turned over 
to criminals. 
We have got prosecutors funded by 
Soros who refuse to put people in jail. 
They won’t do it. Entire categories of 
crime—they 
won’t 
even 
prosecute 
them. Even in Florida, a State where 
we do prosecute people, if you go to a 
CVS or a Walgreens, everything is 
locked up behind that little plastic 
case because people just walk in and 
steal the stuff. It is a spirit of wide-
spread, rampant criminality, and it is 
worse in other parts of the country. 
One of the reasons why people are 
leaving these other places—these were 
once beautiful, glorious cities. They 
are unlivable. That is what people are 
worried about. They are worried about 
becoming a victim of a crime because 
some animals are running loose terror-
izing people and prosecutors won’t do 
anything about it—not to mention that 
we spent 2 years demonizing police offi-
cers around here as well. That is what 
they are worried about. 
They are worried about the border. 
They really are worried about the bor-
der. I get it. Maybe now it is going to 
change because they are busing them 
to New York and here to Washington. 
But I get it. It is very easy, in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4161 
August 6, 2022 
Upper West Side of New York or in the 
West Hollywood area, to not worry 
that much about immigration: We 
shouldn’t have a border. Let’s be nice. 
But the people whose hospitals are 
being overrun, whose schools are being 
overcrowded, whose communities are 
being strained are the communities 
that are taking this influx—7,000, 8,000 
people a day. We are the only country 
on this planet that lets people just 
show up and say, ‘‘Hey, I am here; I am 
staying’’—the only one. 
Mexico doesn’t allow you to do that. 
You can’t do that to Mexico. You can’t 
do that to Canada. You can’t do that in 
Europe. But you can do it here. People 
know it. 
That 
is 
what 
they 
are 
worried 
about—a huge problem. 
And they are worried about the price 
of everything. People focus on gas. It is 
funny. The President said he couldn’t 
control gas prices until they started 
going down a little. You know one of 
the reasons why it is going down? Peo-
ple are driving less. They are not going 
on vacation. They are not taking the 
boat out because it is expensive. 
Frankly, that is what they wanted. 
Do not be fooled. That is what they 
wanted. They were not unhappy about 
high gas prices. They were just upset 
that it happened a few months before 
an election. But the Democrats and the 
left were not unhappy about high gas 
prices because they don’t want you to 
drive. They want everybody to take a 
bus or buy one of these $90,000 Chinese 
electric cars. That is what they want 
everybody to do. We will talk about 
that in a minute. 
They were not happy, but it is not 
just that. I don’t know how many peo-
ple here do their own groceries, but in 
my house we do. I am just telling you, 
it is twice what it used to be. I get it. 
My kids are growing, and they eat 
twice as much, too, but it is twice what 
it used to be—on everything, on every-
thing. And that is just food. 
That is the other problem with infla-
tion. People talk about inflation. The 
inflation that matters the most is the 
necessities, not the flat screen TVs, 
not the new car—the necessities. That 
is what is going up in price: housing, 
clothes, back-to-school supplies, food. 
All of that is through the roof—caused, 
by the way, partially by a bill, one of 
the first things they did in March: $1.9 
trillion of Federal money—of your 
money, the people’s money—poured 
right into the economy. We had a sup-
ply shortage, and we created more de-
mand with all of that money. 
Anyway, that is what people are wor-
ried about: inflation, the crime, the 
border, the real-life stuff. What have 
we spent our time focused on and fight-
ing around here? I can tell you. First, 
a fake—and I mean fake, completely 
fake—electoral rights crisis, election 
rights crisis—totally fake. We spent a 
lot of time on that. 
We spent a lot of time arguing about 
whether we were going to vote on a bill 
to make it easier to shoot police offi-
cers. We spent a lot of time around 
here talking about—in the Federal 
Government in general—things like 
pregnant people, something that does 
not exist. In the 5,500 years of human 
history, every single pregnant person 
that has ever existed happened to be a 
woman, but we talk about pregnant 
people. 
We have a military that likes to put 
out tweets about the proper use of pro-
nouns. We worry a lot about those 
things. We have focused a lot on those 
things. 
Do you know what China is focused 
on? Blowing up our aircraft carriers. 
Maybe we should worry more about 
that. 
This basically is Build Back—what-
ever the name—Build Back Better jun-
ior, just a little bit less—a lot of 
money but just less money. They 
might as well have voted for the one 
they had. I don’t know why the Sen-
ators who kind of gave them their vote 
on this didn’t just agree to the other 
one. This is just a smaller version of 
that. That is what this is. But, anyway, 
that is what we are focused on. 
So you can see, we are up here. We 
are going to vote late at night and into 
the morning, which is fine with me. I 
don’t know if it is fine with everybody, 
but it is fine with me. But at least, if 
we are going to do that, let’s be about 
the things that the people care about, 
that matter to the real people in the 
real world. 
It is not. Instead, here is what we are 
going to do. Here is what we are going 
to do. What we are going to spend time 
on is a $30 billion slush fund they call 
green loans. That is what it is, guys. It 
is a slush fund. It is for all these people 
who have companies that are in the 
green energy space. Those are their 
buddies. They are now going to be able 
to tap into this loan program. They 
have done this once before but not a $30 
billion slush fund. 
We are going to spend $60 billion 
solving environmental racism. I don’t 
even know what that is. I don’t know if 
anybody knows what that is. Like 
when they say ‘‘Latinx.’’ I thought 
that was a band. I have never heard 
that word before in my life, and I don’t 
know what environmental racism is. 
Nine billion on tax credits to help 
people that already have electric cars 
buy another electric car. Let me tell 
you guys something. You may not real-
ize this. I get it, maybe, because the 
bubble around here is so thick. So let 
me tell you the truth. A lot of people 
who voted for you guys, as well, are not 
buying an electric car this year, next 
year, or the year after that for a lot of 
reasons: No. 1, charging stations. It is 
the common sense of everyday people. 
They are not doing it anytime in the 
near future. Maybe this will help them 
30 years from now or their grandkids 30 
years from now but not today. They 
are not buying an electric car because, 
even with your little rebate, it is still 
too much for them. 
They are lucky if they can get a new 
one with gas in it. They have got to 
buy a used car. That is another prob-
lem we have. We are going to help, 
though, with this $9 billion to help peo-
ple buy tax credits—by the way, with a 
Chinese battery in it. Oh, yeah, you 
can’t make those batteries without 
China—so, great for China. I imagine 
spending a bunch more money on solar 
panels that are also made in China. 
And, to kick it all off, thank God—this 
is a good one because I know a lot of 
people are worried about this—$1.5 bil-
lion to plant more trees—whatever. 
And then, on top of all that, they are 
going to hire an army of IRS agents. 
This is the one that I love. They are 
going to go after the people who aren’t 
paying enough on their taxes. 
Let me explain to you something. I 
don’t like it. I don’t necessarily think 
it is a good thing, but I am going to ex-
plain something to these people who 
don’t understand this. These billion-
aires—who, by the way, fund all their 
campaigns, just got a huge break in 
this bill. It is very ironic that these 
billionaires, these corporations, these 
people have armies of lawyers and law 
firms and accountants. And I am tell-
ing you, they will fight these agents. 
So who do you think these agents are 
going to go after? Because fighting 
these corporations isn’t easy, and you 
will eventually run out of billionaires 
to go after. They are going to go after 
small businesses. They are going to go 
after working people—maybe people 
who make $250,000 a year. We think 
that is a lot of money. In some places 
it is in this country. In some places, it 
is a good living. But you are not rich at 
$250,000 in some parts of this country. 
You are doing all right, no doubt about 
it, but you are not a billionaire. 
They are going to go after them. 
They are going to go after the people 
who cannot afford to hire an army of 
lawyers and accountants to fight off 
the IRS agents—thousands of IRS 
agents, not police officers to go after 
criminals; IRS agents to go after 
American taxpayers. That is who they 
are going to go after. 
I promise you—and I regret to say 
it—that a lot of hard-working people 
are going to be getting letters in the 
mail saying: Hey, we want to talk to 
you about your taxes from 5 years ago, 
from 3 years ago, because we think you 
might have messed up. 
And you don’t have an army of law-
yers. You are going to pay them what-
ever they say, even if you have to take 
out a credit line on your house, be-
cause you don’t want trouble with the 
IRS. That is what this bill does. That is 
what this bill is. Everyone else is cov-
ered. 
And they cynically call it the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. And let me tell 
you why they call it that. This is actu-
ally very sad and outrageous. They call 
it that because—I am telling you, and 
I hate to say it, but a lot of the people 
behind this kind of stuff, they see hard- 
working, everyday Americans as a 
bunch of uneducated simpletons who 
will just fall for this. And the media

will help them. They know the media 
will help them—not all the media, but 
a lot of the reporters will help them, 
even though the reporters themselves 
keep calling this a climate bill because 
they are so giddy about that part of it. 
But they think the people are going 
to just fall for it. People are not going 
to fall for it. I don’t care how smart 
you think you are and how uneducated 
you think they are. They have got 
something most people involved in our 
government have lost or maybe never 
had. It is called common sense, and 
they have the common sense of know-
ing that making it easier for people to 
buy, with a credit, an electric car in 3 
years is not going to do anything for 
them. They are not buying an electric 
car anytime in the near future. 
You know what they want? They 
want gas prices to come down because 
America is producing more oil. That is 
what they would like. That is what 
they would like. 
They would like you to put criminals 
in jail and keep them there. They 
would like you to secure our border, 
just a little bit. Don’t pretend that you 
are doing anything about it, because 
they know the truth. 
Guys, it is a scam. This very week-
end, this very Friday—and I live in 
Miami. I don’t read about this stuff in 
a magazine. I see it with my own eyes; 
I hear it with my own ears. 
I had this couple telling me the flat- 
out story. Their kids were already here 
because their kids were born here. 
Years ago, when they were here vis-
iting, their kids were born here. U.S. 
citizens. Their kids are already here. 
This couple paid $5,000 each. They were 
driven to the border in a van. They 
were turned over to an agency right on 
the border who turned them over to the 
officers. They spent a day and a half in 
detention. Their papers were filled out. 
They were turned back over to the 
agency. The agency asked them: Where 
you would like to go? 
I would like to go to Miami. 
They gave them a ticket to go to 
Miami. They even gave them a little 
card to buy things before they got 
there. And now they are living in 
South Florida. 
And what do you think? You don’t 
think they are going to call back home 
and tell people: Hey, we made it, and 
here is how we made it. And those are 
the people that can afford to buy the 
$5,000 each or save it. A lot of people 
can’t. So they have to turn themselves 
over into the hands of these criminal, 
delinquent 
traffickers, 
evil 
persons 
who take advantage of these migrants. 
And they are coming because we are in-
viting them to come. This administra-
tion is inviting them to come. They are 
inviting them to come. 
When you tell people: Don’t come. 
But if you do, you are going to get to 
stay, they are going to come. And that 
is what is happening. We are not fo-
cused on that. They get it. People back 
home get it. And you are not going to 
convince them that any of the stuff 
here is any good for them. 
And it is happening, frankly, because 
the modern Democratic Party—listen, 
I live in South Florida. It is a majority 
Democratic county. I have had Demo-
crat friends. I have worked with lib-
erals my whole life. I have done a 
bunch bipartisan stuff. You are not bad 
people. But the modern Democratic 
Party does not care about working 
Americans. The only thing they care 
about is the agenda of a bunch of 
laptop liberals and Marxist misfits who 
threaten to burn down any city any 
time they don’t get their way on some 
issues and a bunch of climate extrem-
ists. And that is what this bill re-
flects—at least two of those three. And 
that is what this bill does. 
That is the only people they cater to. 
That is what their issues are always 
about. And what they do is they put on 
the disguise of calling it the Inflation 
Reduction Act. But they can’t even say 
it with a straight face. They really 
can’t because they know it is not true. 
This bill has nothing to do with what 
real people in the real world are wor-
ried about every single day. And the 
ironies are so thick. 
I think about this carried interest 
loophole, as they call it. We have got 
prominent Members of the Democratic 
Party in the Senate who have made a 
career out of calling that basically an 
unfair and immoral benefit for hedge 
fund managers and greedy billionaires. 
They have made a career out of it. Yet 
today, they will vote on a bill that 
stripped out taking rid of that loop-
hole. They will vote for it. They will 
vote for it. That is the irony embedded 
in all of this. 
So they will do their press con-
ferences and speeches. They will be 
very impressed with themselves. The 
Twitter warriors are going to love it. 
The MSNBCs and the ‘‘Meet the Press-
es’’ are all going to say—whoever, 
CNN, whatever—they are all going to 
be giddy about it. But for millions and 
millions of working Americans, noth-
ing is going to change for them for the 
better. There isn’t a single thing in 
this bill that helps working people 
lower the price of groceries or the price 
of gasoline or the price of housing or 
the price of clothes. There isn’t a sin-
gle thing in this bill that will keep 
criminals in jail. There isn’t a single 
thing in this bill that is going to secure 
our border. And those happen to be the 
things that working people in this 
country care about. And the gap be-
tween the people who run this place 
and the people who are the backbone of 
this country is so massive, the dis-
connect so great, that the division that 
is driving our politics is reaching a 
boiling point, unfortunately. 
What makes this Nation different 
from all the countries in the world is 
our working class. Every nation has 
rich people. Every country in the world 
has wealthy people. What has made us 
different is that here, by the millions, 
people like my parents—a bartender 
and a maid—were able to own a home 
and raise a family and leave them bet-
ter off than themselves. And they were 
never rich and they were never famous, 
and they lived the American dream be-
cause they retired with dignity. And 
with their own eyes, they saw their 
children have the opportunity to do the 
things they themselves never could do. 
That is what makes us different. Those 
are the people that are hurting. Those 
are the people that got wiped out in 
2007 and 2008 when Wall Street created 
a crisis and when Wall Street got 
bailed out. Those are the people whose 
kids couldn’t go to school because in 
some parts of this country, we shut 
school down for a year and a half, while 
the people shutting down the schools, 
their kids were going to private schools 
and had private tutors. And those are 
the people that are getting destroyed 
right now by this economy. And they 
are being ignored and disrespected and 
completely, completely obliterated by 
a bill that does absolutely nothing for 
them. 
And that is what your U.S. Senate 
will spend late into the night and early 
into the morning voting on. The dis-
connect is massive. And I can point to 
a lot of examples, but this has become 
exhibit A in that disconnect. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee is recognized. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, as 
I was reading through this reckless 
spending spree that my Democratic 
colleagues are in such a rush to get 
this thing passed so that they can get 
it signed into law—I was reading it, 
and I thought, you know, we have been 
through this exercise before. 
We have before us a bill that is too 
expensive to afford. It has been thrown 
together behind closed doors, in secret, 
perfectly branded to prey on the strug-
gles, the fears of the American people 
because after all, fearful people are 
easier to control. 
And what do we know? The Demo-
cratic Party, they are all about control 
and they are all about power. 
Now, I remembered that this isn’t 
the first time in the Schumer Senate 
that the Democratic colleagues have 
tried to turn a crisis into an oppor-
tunity. A little over a year ago, they 
pulled the exact same bait-and-switch 
with a $1.9 trillion American Rescue 
Plan. Senator GRAHAM
talked about 
this before. It was to bring, oh, so 
much prosperity. It was to solve all of 
your problems, help was on the way. 
But it was a big government blowout in 
the form of $350 billion in the slush 
fund for blue cities, a State tax cut 
ban, a $60 billion tax hike, subsidized 
government healthcare, and a union 
pension bailout. 
Now, it is pretty clear who the Demo-
crats were trying to rescue with that 
bill. And it was not hard-working 
American taxpayers. They got the 
shaft on that. And they know it. 
And then, of course, we considered 
the infrastructure package that had al-
most nothing to do with infrastruc-
ture, but it served as a very useful ve-
hicle for a lot of the Green New Deal.

S4163 
August 6, 2022 
Remember, Build Back Better—they 
couldn’t get it across. They had to 
break it into parts. So you have seen 
parts of it in different bills. Part of it 
was in that infrastructure package. 
To Tennesseans, this was a missed 
opportunity because they desperately 
need 
meaningful 
improvements 
to 
broadband infrastructure and access to 
high-speed internet connections. It was 
a missed opportunity for all Americans 
seeing crime and drugs that are in 
their communities because of that open 
border. And it was a missed oppor-
tunity for the Keystone XL Pipeline 
and for support for American energy. 
Missed opportunities continue to be 
their thing. Just a few short days ago, 
we passed a CHIPS and Science bill. 
Sounds really good and constructive. 
But over the course of a few years, this 
ballooned from an emergency invest-
ment in semiconductors into an almost 
$300 billion gateway to industrial plan-
ning and, of course, more of the Green 
New Deal. 
My Democratic colleagues took an 
opportunity to unravel our dangerous 
relationship with the Chinese Com-
munist Party and squandered it on a 
tee-up to seizing more control over the 
manufacturing and upstream suppliers 
we should be empowering. 
Fast forward to this month, and here 
we go again, sifting through a package 
that costs nearly a trillion dollars, yet 
is somehow still marketed as the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. 
And I will say to my Democratic col-
leagues and Senator SCHUMER and Sen-
ator MANCHIN, the American people are 
laughing at the name of this bill. They 
are laughing at this. They know better 
than this. They can see right through 
what you have done. They know what 
is going on. And they know that your 
priorities do not line up with their pri-
orities and their concerns. 
In reality, this bill provides no path-
way to reduce our current inflation. It 
will, however, put pressure on the 
economy, raise taxes on just about ev-
eryone, kills jobs, stifles innovation, 
weaponizes 
the 
regulatory 
state 
against small businesses and private 
enterprise. 
Now, all these things have the poten-
tial to devastate the economy and 
make life harder for hard-working tax-
payers. 
I want to focus on how Joe Biden and 
the Democrats are using regulators to 
overrule the will of the people and to 
seize more control over the country be-
cause this tactic has truly been a fa-
vorite of the Democrats. They expand 
the regulatory state. They issue man-
dates. They institute lockdowns. And, 
there is that word again: ‘‘control.’’ 
They are after the control. 
If you need an example, look no fur-
ther than the dozens of newly arrived 
rules and regulations that they have 
used to gut American energy. Radical 
climate activists in the environmental 
lobby won big when those went into ef-
fect. But everyone else lost. 
If you were an energy consumer, a 
truckdriver, someone who was trav-
eling, and workers who had their jobs 
just regulated out of existence, that is 
what the Democrats did for you. 
Here is another. In April, the Biden 
Border Patrol announced that they 
were holding up construction on the 
border wall so that they could do an 
environmental assessment. 
Now, if you recall, this is one regu-
latory barrier that President Trump 
eliminated when he took office because 
he understood the danger posed by our 
lack of border security. He was listen-
ing to the American people and the 
Border Patrol and people that lived 
there. He knew what was happening. 
Well, under President Biden, the open 
borders advocates won. But the ranch-
ers, the border communities, small- 
town law enforcement—they lost. 
The Biden administration loves to 
use the regulatory hammer so that 
they can pick winners and losers that 
they want. They will punish you. They 
will punish you. It is what they are 
doing with the bill that we are consid-
ering tonight in the middle of the 
night, on the weekend, when people are 
at the lake, when people are out with 
their children, having fun, enjoying the 
summer. Here we are. 
It is so interesting that they have 
married the strategy they used last 
March by catering to—you guessed it— 
blue States, unions, and climate justice 
warriors. 
Here is just one example of one of the 
regulatory schemes contained in the 
bill that will benefit the usual Demo-
cratic allies but wreak havoc on every-
one else. Right now, manufacturers 
that burn fossil fuels can earn a $35 tax 
credit for every ton of carbon dioxide 
they capture and store. 
The bill cuts that tax credit down to 
$17. But there is a catch. A business 
can earn an $85 tax credit if they com-
ply with labor standards that are laid 
out in the bill. This, of course, means 
that in order to survive, manufacturers 
and fossil fuel companies will be man-
dated to use union labor. 
Nuclear power plants will have a 
similar hit. If this legislation passes, 
they will earn $12 more per ton in tax 
credits if they go to the unions instead 
of letting the free market determine 
who they hire. 
Now, the problem here doesn’t only 
have to do with unions versus right-to- 
work policies. The problem is that the 
base tax credit reductions in this bill 
were designed to kill companies that 
don’t want to play along with the left’s 
green crusade and funnel money to 
CHUCK SCHUMER’s political allies. 
Hear me out. If, for example, you are 
running a utility in a right-to-work 
State and you want to keep taking ad-
vantage of tax credits, you are going to 
be in a very tight spot. When this bill 
becomes law, you will be stripped of 
your practical ability to hire right-to- 
work employees and mandated to use 
union labor instead. The kowtowing to 
union demands is also part of a pat-
tern. 
Just a few days ago, my Democratic 
colleagues killed my amendment to the 
PACT Act that would have given toxic- 
exposed veterans expedited access to 
community care. Now, why did they do 
that? To protect union employees in 
VA facilities, of course. We can’t take 
a step like that; it might privatize VA, 
they seem to think. 
Now, instead of the healthcare that 
they deserve, these veterans are left 
with nothing but false hope—access to 
the queue but no access to the care. 
Over and over again, it never stops 
here in the Schumer Senate. The 
Democrats say one thing; they turn 
around and do another thing. 
The bill also increases renewable tax 
credits but only for projects located in 
the so-called environmental justice 
communities, wherever they are. That 
is a very creative way for my Demo-
cratic colleagues to tell us they are 
using this increase to funnel money to 
the cities and States they deem worthy 
of support. 
The measure is simple: You comply 
or you go bankrupt. Then, again, you 
might go bankrupt if you do comply. 
Doing so will increase project costs and 
labor costs, which will, in turn, in-
crease costs on everything. Everyone 
loses except the Democrats and their 
political allies. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
become famous for saying one thing 
and doing another. They promise infla-
tion reduction, then raise manufac-
turing costs. They promise economic 
relief but then raise your utility costs 
and your grocery bills. They assure the 
American people, time and again, that 
Big Government can solve your prob-
lems, and then they use Big Govern-
ment to absolutely beat the living stew 
out of private enterprise. 
My Democratic colleagues have tout-
ed this latest disastrous version of 
their ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda as 
progressive. And I do hope the Amer-
ican people are figuring out what ‘‘pro-
gressive’’ means: tax increases, mas-
sive transfers of wealth, ideological 
conformity backed by the full faith and 
credit of the United States. 
If you want to be broke and grovel to 
the government, this bill is for you. 
These hundreds of billions of dollars 
will serve a purpose but not to reduce 
inflation or bring relief. Blue States, 
unions, radical activists will once 
again come out on top. Meanwhile, 
families working hard to make ends 
meet, workers, business owners, local 
leaders are still on the verge of losing 
everything. I think my Democratic col-
leagues know this, but they have de-
cided that the pain and the suffering is 
worth it. After all, they continue to

crats have sold them a bill of goods

It is about power. And to Tennesseans, 
this is all frightening. They think that

(1) recognizes the significant contributions 
to the United States of citizens of Hellenic 
heritage; and 
(2) commemorates the 100th Anniversary of 
the founding of the American Hellenic Edu-
cational Progressive Association, applauds

the world. 
The resolution (S. Res. 675), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 675 
Whereas 
the 
American 
Hellenic 
Edu-
cational Progressive Association (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘AHEPA’’) was founded 
on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, Georgia, by 8 vi-
sionary Greek immigrants to help unify, or-
ganize, and protect individuals of all ethnic, 
racial, and religious backgrounds against the 
bigotry, discrimination, and defamation per-
petrated predominantly by the Ku Klux 
Klan; 
Whereas the mission of AHEPA is to pro-
mote the Hellenic ideals of ancient Greece, 
which include philanthropy, education, civic 
responsibility, and family and individual ex-
cellence through community service and vol-
unteerism; 
Whereas, since the inception of AHEPA, 
the organization has instilled in the mem-
bers of AHEPA an understanding of their 
Hellenic heritage and an awareness of the 
contributions that Hellenic heritage has 
made to the development of democratic prin-
ciples and governance in the United States 
and throughout the world; 
Whereas AHEPA has done much through-
out the history of the organization to foster 
patriotism in the United States; 
Whereas members of AHEPA have served 
in the Armed Forces of the United States to 
protect the freedom of the people of the 
United States and to preserve those demo-
cratic ideals that are part of the Hellenic 
legacy; 
Whereas, in World War II, members of 
AHEPA parachuted behind enemy lines in 
Nazi-occupied Greece to help liberate Greece; 
Whereas 
AHEPA 
raised 
more 
than 
$253,000,000 for United States war bonds dur-
ing World War II, and, as a result of the ef-
fort, AHEPA was named an official issuing 
agent for United States war bonds by the De-
partment of the Treasury, an honor that no 
other civic organization had yet achieved; 
Whereas, in 1990, the members of AHEPA 
donated $612,000 toward the restoration of 
the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, New 
York, for which AHEPA received special rec-
ognition by the Department of the Interior; 
Whereas the AHEPA National Housing 
Program has sponsored safe and dignified af-
fordable housing for vulnerable senior citi-
zens under the Section 202 Supportive Hous-
ing for the Elderly program (administered by 
the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment and authorized under section 202 of 
the Housing Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. 1701q)), and 
the sponsorship has a portfolio of 4,467 units 
in 87 communities in 19 States; 
Whereas AHEPA has engaged in ‘‘Track 
Two Diplomacy’’ to foster reconciliation and 
rapprochement in the Eastern Mediterra-
nean, which is in the best interest of the 
United States, and has enhanced people-to- 
people ties between countries; 
Whereas 
AHEPA 
financially 
supports 
scholarships, natural disaster and humani-
tarian relief, medical research, and countless 
other charitable and philanthropic causes by 
contributing more than $2,200,000 annually 
from the national, district, and local levels 
of AHEPA; 
Whereas generations of Greek American 
women and Philhellenes have worked to 
strengthen society through service organiza-
tions, such as the Daughters of Penelope, in 
order to— 
(1) provide affordable housing for older 
adults; 
(2) sponsor and support domestic violence 
shelters; 
(3) provide scholarship awards; 
(4) raise awareness and provide financial 
support for medical research and charitable 
causes; and 
(5) help those in need of humanitarian as-
sistance or natural disaster relief; 
Whereas, in the spirit of their Hellenic her-
itage and in commemoration of the Centen-
nial Olympic Games held in Atlanta, Geor-
gia, members of AHEPA raised $775,000 for 
the Tribute to Olympism and Hellenism 
sculpture, the fan-like structure of which 
helped to save lives during the 1996 Olympic 
Bombing at Centennial Olympic Park; 
Whereas members of AHEPA raised $110,000 
for the creation of the George C. Marshall 
Statue erected on the grounds of the United 
States Embassy in Athens, Greece, in cele-
bration of the historic relationship between 
the United States and Greece and in tribute 
to General Marshall, an outstanding states-
man and Philhellene; 
Whereas 
members 
of 
AHEPA 
raised 
$1,000,000 toward the rebuilding of Saint 
Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and Na-
tional Shrine at the World Trade Center, 
which was the only house of worship de-
stroyed on September 11, 2001; 
Whereas members of AHEPA have been 
Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United 
States, United States Senators and Rep-
resentatives, and United States Ambas-
sadors, and have served honorably as elected 
and appointed officials at local and State 
levels throughout the United States; and 
Whereas President George H. W. Bush cited 
AHEPA as 1 of the ‘‘thousand points of 
light’’ in the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the significant contributions 
to the United States of citizens of Hellenic 
heritage; and 
(2) commemorates the 100th Anniversary of 
the founding of the American Hellenic Edu-
cational Progressive Association, applauds 
its mission, and commends the many chari-
table contributions of its members to com-
munities in the United States and around

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4166 
August 6, 2022 
In Section 13204, the term ‘‘lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions’’ for a quali-
fied hydrogen facility is determined by 
the aggregate quantity of greenhouse 
gas emissions through the point of pro-
duction, as determined under the most 
recent Greenhouse gases, Regulated 
Emissions, and Energy use in Tech-
nologies—GREET—model. It is also my 
understanding of the intent of section 
13204, is that in determining ‘‘lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions’’ for this sec-
tion, the Secretary shall recognize and 
incorporate indirect book accounting 
factors, also known as a book and 
claim system, that reduce effective 
greenhouse gas emissions, which in-
cludes, but is not limited to, renewable 
energy 
credits, 
renewable 
thermal 
credits, renewable identification num-
bers, or biogas credits. 
Is that the chairman’s understanding 
as well? 
Mr. WYDEN. Yes. 
Mr. CARPER. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man. 
Additionally, I would like to clarify 
that the intent of section 13701 allows 
the Secretary to consider indirect book 
and claim factors that reduce effective 
greenhouse gas emissions to help deter-
mine whether the greenhouse gas rate 
of a qualified fuel cell property, which 
does not include facilities that produce 
electricity through combustion or gas-
ification, is ‘‘not greater than zero.’’ 
Is 
that 
the 
chairman’s 
under-
standing? 
Mr. WYDEN. Yes. 
Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator 
from Oregon for his comments on these 
issues and his leadership. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to engage in a colloquy with the 
distinguished chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, Senator WYDEN. I 
want to comment on the transferable 
tax credit provisions supporting sus-
tainability in the bill and, in par-
ticular, the application of general limi-
tations that already exist in current 
law for various tax credits. As the 
chairman knows, the bill includes a 
historic investment in tax credits and 
incentives to promote the development 
of various clean energy technologies 
and provides a broad regime to permit 
eligible credits to be transferred from 
the project owners to another unre-
lated taxpayer. 
Under current law, the ability to 
claim general business tax credits is 
subject to a number of potential limi-
tations in section 38 of the Tax Code 
based on the taxpayer’s income tax li-
ability. The bill language does not ap-
pear to apply the section 38 limitations 
to reduce the amount of the credit eli-
gible to be transferred by the trans-
feror of tax credits. This would be con-
sistent with the goal of encouraging 
additional investment by expanding 
the availability of these tax credits to 
project owners without regard to their 
ability to claim the credits themselves. 
I expect that the Treasury Depart-
ment will develop technical guidance 
for these transferable credits in a man-
ner that reflects the intent that the 
section 38 limitations under current 
law will not apply to the transferor. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator for 
his inquiry and can clarify that the 
Senator is correct that the current-law 
limitations that generally apply to tax 
credits under section 38 would not re-
duce the amount of credits eligible for 
transfer by the transferor of transfer-
able tax credits under the bill and that 
the Treasury Department should issue 
technical guidance that reflects this 
intent. 
Mr. CARDIN. I welcome the chair-
man’s leadership and support to clarify 
this issue, ensuring that the amount of 
the tax credits eligible for transfer are 
not limited by section 38 so that they 
will, in fact, expand investment in 
projects that will achieve the broader 
climate goals of this bill. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to engage in a col-
loquy with Senator WYDEN for clari-
fication regarding a tax provision in-
cluded in the bill currently before the 
Senate. Section 13704 of the bill, which 
concerns 
production 
credits 
for 
biofuels, defines ‘‘transportation fuel’’ 
that can qualify for the credit as a fuel 
that is suitable for use as a fuel in a 
highway vehicle or aircraft. The fuel 
must also be below a carbon emissions 
ceiling and meet a processing require-
ment. 
Senator WYDEN, as chair of the Fi-
nance Committee, is it his under-
standing that, although a fuel must be 
suitable for use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft to qualify for this 
biofuel production credit, it may still 
actually be used for any business pur-
pose, including as transportation fuel, 
industrial fuel, or for residential or 
commercial heat? 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator for 
her inquiry. That is correct. The credit 
is intended to incentivize production of 
biofuels of a certain quality, usable as 
fuel for highway vehicles or aircrafts, 
but not limited only to fuels which are 
actually used in highway vehicles or 
aircrafts. 
Ms. HASSAN. I thank the chair for 
that clarification and for engaging in 
this colloquy. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to engage in a colloquy with my 
colleague, the chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, Senator WYDEN. 
In the corporate alternative min-
imum tax, there is some question as to 
whether companies that operate in for-
eign countries with standard tax years 
that are different from the U.S. could 
lose foreign tax credits strictly because 
of these non-conforming years. This 
may especially be an issue in the very 
first year of the corporate alternative 
minimum tax’s application. 
Does Treasury have authority to 
issue regulations dealing with poten-
tial issues with foreign income taxes 
relating to nonconforming foreign tax 
years and how that impacts foreign tax 
credits in the corporate alternative 
minimum tax? This would include fair 
rules for the utilization of foreign tax 
credits in the law’s first year. 
Mr. WYDEN. Yes, regulations such as 
these would be in line with the legisla-
tive text and our intent for companies 
to be able to appropriately utilize for-
eign tax credits in the corporate alter-
native minimum tax. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the chair-
man for this clarification of the provi-
sion. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to engage in a colloquy with the 
distinguished chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, Senator WYDEN. 
I want to ask for a clarification of 
the provision in the underlying bill re-
garding the corporate book minimum 
tax. Is it the chairman’s understanding 
and intent that, because the corporate 
alternative minimum tax is based on 
financial statement income, it does not 
include Other Comprehensive Income? 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator for 
his inquiry and can clarify that, for 
purposes of the corporate alternative 
minimum tax, Other Comprehensive 
Income is not included in financial 
statement income. 
Mr. CARDIN. I thank the chairman 
for that clarification. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to engage in a col-
loquy with Senator WYDEN for clari-
fication regarding a tax provision in-
cluded in the bill currently before the 
Senate. 
With regard to the advanced manu-
facturing tax credit, it is the intention 
that section 45X, as established by sec-
tion 13502 of the Inflation Reduction 
Act, is intended to apply to compo-
nents for which production was com-
pleted after December 31, 2022, and are 
sold to an unrelated party after Decem-
ber 31, 2022? 
In other words, the credit should be 
available to the entirety of eligible 
components 
currently 
underway 
if 
those components are concluded after 
2022. For example, an offshore wind 
vessel that began construction in 2019 
and was completed at a date after De-
cember 31, 2022, would be eligible for 
the credit applied to the full cost of 
production of the vessel and not just 
for the portion completed after Decem-
ber 31, 2022. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator for 
his inquiry. That is correct. The credit 
is intended for any eligible components 
produced and sold after December 31, 
2022, regardless of the portion of the 
component that was produced before 
January 1, 2023. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I look 
forward to passing this important piece 
of legislation that will help fight infla-
tion, invest in domestic energy produc-
tion and manufacturing, reduce carbon 
emissions, and lower healthcare costs 
for millions of Americans. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to engage in a colloquy with the 
distinguished chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, Senator WYDEN.

the credit under section 53 and a tax-
payer’s liability under section 59A, the 
base erosion and anti-abuse tax. Does 
the Treasury have authority to issue 
regulations 
dealing 
with 
potential 
issues with the ordering of the calcula-
tion of the credit under section 53 and 
the tax under section 59A? 
Mr. WYDEN. Yes, we believe that 
Treasury will have authority to issue 
regulations 
dealing 
with 
potential 
issues with the ordering of the calcula-
tion of the credit under section 53 and 
the tax under section 59A. Regulations 
such as these would be in line with our 
intent in drafting the BEAT inter-
action provisions in the corporate al-
ternative minimum tax. 
Mr. CARDIN. I thank the chairman 
for that clarification. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
would like to engage my friend the 
chairman of the Finance Committee, 
Senator WYDEN, in a colloquy. 
One of the many vital investments 
made in the Inflation Reduction Act to 
reduce energy costs and confront the 
climate crisis is the qualified commer-
cial clean vehicle credit. This provides 
a tax credit of up to $40,000 for quali-
fied heavy commercial electric vehi-
cles, or up to $7,500 for qualified com-
mercial electric vehicles weighing less 
than 14,000 pounds, which includes both 
trucks and mobile machinery. 
Mobile machinery is a vehicle that is 
unrelated to transportation, such as a 
forklift or bulldozer. The qualified 
commercial clean vehicle credit uti-
lizes an existing statutory definition of 
mobile 
machinery, 
the 
purpose 
of 
which is to provide for an exemption 
from the excise tax on heavy trucks 
that is deposited into the highway 
trust fund. 
The new application of the mobile 
machinery definition will raise novel 
questions about which types of vehicles 
qualify as mobile machinery, in cases 
where the determination was not nec-
essary in the context of the excise tax 
on heavy trucks. One such case is com-
mercial lawn mowers, most of which 
currently have gas-powered engines 
that are a significant source of pollu-
tion. 
I ask the chairman of the Finance 
Committee whether commercial lawn 
mowers can fit the criteria of mobile 
machinery and, therefore, qualify for 
the qualified commercial clean vehicle 
credit, provided that the vehicle meets 
the other criteria for the credit. 
Mr. WYDEN. A commercial lawn 
mower could qualify as mobile machin-
ery, since it performs a similar oper-
ation to the purposes listed in the stat-
ute. Therefore, if such a vehicle met 
the other criteria for the qualified 
commercial clean vehicle credit, it 
would be eligible. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the Sen-
ator for clarifying this point, and I 
share that understanding. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the leg-
islation being considered today in-
cludes a historic expansion of the sec-
tion 179D commercial buildings energy- 
efficiency tax deduction. The deduc-
tion, made permanent in 2020, is an im-
portant tool to tackle climate change 
by encouraging investments in energy- 
efficient buildings. 
I have been made aware of a discour-
aging trend among those who use sec-
tion 179D that some entities attempt to 
receive payments in exchange for pro-
viding section 179D allocation letters 
to private sector building designers. 
As I have said before, entities seek-
ing to avail themselves of the tax bene-
fits of section 179D cannot seek, accept, 
or solicit payments from designers in 
exchange for providing section 179D al-
location letters. 
The issuance of a section 179D alloca-
tion letter shall not be used as leverage 
to request a payment from a designer; 
allocation letters should be duly issued 
once the applicable design services 
have been performed. 
These actions run counter to the in-
tent of section 179D(d)(4)’s express di-
rection to allow the allocation of the 
section 179D deduction ‘‘. . . to the per-
son primarily responsible for designing 
the property in lieu of the owner of 
such property.’’ 
Consistent with congressional intent, 
section 179D allocation letters are ad-
ministrative in nature and serve to for-
malize the allocation of the tax deduc-
tion to the eligible designer. 
As section 179D is rightly expanded 
in the legislation being considered in 
the Senate, it must be reaffirmed that 
it is congressional intent that entities 
cannot seek, accept, or solicit pay-
ments in exchange for providing 179D 
allocation letters. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
body has a long record of coming to-
gether to improve healthcare for Amer-
icans. In 2003, we worked in a bipar-
tisan manner to establish the Medicare 
Part D benefit. More recently, I have 
worked with my Finance Committee 
colleagues on oversight investigations 
to hold: EpiPen manufacturers ac-
countable who were misusing taxpayer 
dollars, 
insulin 
manufacturers 
and 
PBMs accountable who were unfairly 
increasing the list price of insulin, and 
our organ donation system accountable 
and investigate its troubling under-
performance. 
We can work together and meaning-
fully improve healthcare. This Con-
gress, I have worked with my Demo-
crat colleagues to introduce eight bills 
to lower drug costs. In the past year 
alone, we have passed five of my bills 
out of committee on a bipartisan basis. 
They will lower drug prices and create 
more competition while holding Big 
Pharma and PBMs accountable. Unfor-
tunately, the leader hasn’t brought any 
of these bills up for a vote, even though 
they would easily pass the Senate. But 
this hasn’t stopped me from trying to 
find other ways to help bring down the 
cost of medications. 
In 2019, as Finance Committee chair-
man, I began a bipartisan committee 
process with the ranking member from 
Oregon to lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. The bill is called the Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. 
We held three committee hearings to 
learn from policymakers and advocates 
while also holding Big Pharma and 
PBMs accountable. We held a com-
mittee mark-up where the bill passed 
19 to 9, on a bipartisan basis. We con-
tinued to hold additional negotiations 
to make improvements to the bill. It 
contained stuff I liked and didn’t like. 
But that is bipartisan legislation. 
Today, it is still the only comprehen-
sive prescription drug bill that can gar-
ner more than 60 votes on the Senate 
floor. 
I recently outlined on the floor the 
bill’s details in case the majority party 
has forgotten. I won’t restate every 
part of my July 20 speech, but here are 
some of my bill’s key measures: No. 1, 
it lowers costs for seniors by $72 billion 
and saves taxpayers $95 billion. No. 2, 
it establishes an out-of-pocket cap, 
eliminates the donut hole, and rede-
signs Medicare Part D. No. 3, it ends 
taxpayer subsidies to Big Pharma by 
capping price increases of Medicare 
Part B and D drugs at inflation. No. 4, 
it establishes accountability and trans-
parency in the pharmaceutical indus-
try. No. 5, and the bill is bipartisan. 
Believe it or not, a bipartisan bill lim-
iting pharmaceutical increases is pos-
sible. Compare this to what the major-
ity has offered: Their partisan bill in-
cludes more reckless spending and tax 
increases. Their partisan bill reduces 
the number of new cures and treat-
ments. Their partisan bill fails to enact 
any bipartisan accountability for Big 
Pharma and PBMs. 
Even while the majority party has 
decided to pursue a purely partisan bill 
in secret over the past 20 months, I 
have continued to meet with Demo-
crats and Republicans to advance my 
bipartisan and negotiated bill. I have 
met or spoken with: President Biden 
and White House staff, Speaker PELOSI, 
Leader 
MCCARTHY, 
HHS 
Secretary 
Becerra, House Democrats who wanted 
a bipartisan bill, Problem Solvers Cau-
cus Health Care Working Group, Con-
gressman 
WELCH, 
Congresswoman 
McMorris Rodgers, Democrat Senators 
SINEMA and CARPER, and others. 
I wanted a bipartisan bill to pass this 
Senate. We could still pass the Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. 
My colleagues know it. Several of them 
have thanked me publicly on my bipar-
tisan work to lower prescription drug 
prices. Sadly, they have chosen a dif-
ferent route. They have chosen a bill 
that contains zero PBM accountability. 
It gives middlemen a pass. They have 
chosen a bill that contains none of the 
25 accountability and transparency 
provisions that had bipartisan con-
sensus in my bill. This includes ending 
DIR clawbacks that are hurting pa-
tients 
pocketbooks 
and 
small/inde-
pendent pharmacies; ending ‘‘spread 
pricing’’ in Medicaid that is drive up 
taxpayer costs; requiring sunshine on 
PBMs through financial audits, so we 
knows the true net cost of a drug; re-
quiring sunshine on excessive drug

price increases and launch price of new 
high-cost drugs. None of these bipar-
tisan accountability and transparency 
provisions—and more—are included in 
their bill. 
Finally, one last thing I would like 
to address about my colleagues’ reck-
less tax and spending bill: I have heard 
some of my colleagues on the other 
side say this bill’s prescription drug 
provision is Grassley-Wyden. That is 
untrue. This is a reckless tax and 
spending bill. It is not bipartisan, and 
no reporter should accept or repeat 
that notion. I oppose the partisan bill 
because it is a long list of reckless tax 
increases and spending. This is not the 
bipartisan prescription drug bill that 
passed out of the Finance Committee 
19 to 9. 
I have filed the Prescription Drug 
Pricing Reduction Act as an amend-
ment today. We could strike and re-
place this reckless tax and spending 
spree with comprehensive drug pricing 
reform that could garner more than 60 
votes and lower drug prices while hold-
ing Big Pharma and PBMs accountable. 
We could actually enact meaningful ac-
countability and transparency in the 
pharmaceutical industry. I have filed 
that amendment, too. We could pursue 
PBM transparency and accountability. 
I have filed that amendment, too. 
I have said throughout this Congress, 
I will work with anyone who wants to 
pass the bipartisan and negotiated Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
H.R. 5376 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this evening to talk 
about the partisan reconciliation legis-
lation that is before us tonight. It is 
named the Inflation Reduction Act, but 
that is misnamed because, unfortu-
nately, it does not reduce inflation; it 
actually makes things worse. 
When you are at the gas pump or at 
the grocery store or buying something 
anywhere today, you are feeling the 
sticker shock. Yet this legislation is 
going to make it even worse. It adds 
$700 billion more in spending and over 
$300 billion more in new taxes at the 
worst possible time, increasing costs to 
consumers and actually making infla-
tion worse. 
The 
nonpartisan 
Penn 
Wharton 
Budget Model that a lot of us have used 
over the years to look at various legis-
lation predicts that it will actually in-
crease inflation over the next 2 years. 
While over time it says that may 
even out, it won’t decrease inflation as 
the name suggests and the bill sponsors 
claim. Why? Well, primarily because 
when you put $300 billion-plus of new 
taxes in the economy, it actually hurts 
workers and it hurts consumers. 
Yes, they are saying it is going to go 
to companies, but what happens then? 
Companies pass it along. And at a time 
when we have the worst inflation in 
over 40 years, that is bad for the econ-
omy. 
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation that we have to rely on here 
in Congress—not a partisan group but 
nonpartisan—says this bill will hurt 
Americans in nearly every tax bracket. 
They say that more than half of the 
burden of the over $300 billion in new 
taxes is going to fall on folks making 
less than $400,000 a year. 
Well, that directly contradicts prom-
ises made not to increase taxes on 
Americans at that level. 
While I am glad the blow to manufac-
turers has been somewhat softened in 
the last 24 hours, with the latest 
version of the bill, what the Democrats 
did was essentially exchange one bad 
tax—the book tax on manufacturers— 
for another bad tax, a tax that will tax 
stock buybacks, that is going to hurt 
particularly Americans who are trying 
to save for retirement. 
Let me start with the book tax. This 
is a proposed tax that is very different 
from the existing corporate income tax 
which is based on income that business 
report to the IRS when they file their 
taxes. That IRS income, by the way, is 
defined by the U.S. Congress. Here in 
the Senate, we debate that all the 
time: Is it good to have a particular 
tax incentive or another tax incentive, 
that is not in the book tax? The book 
tax, instead, looks at a company’s fi-
nancial statement. And that is what 
this new bill does. 
In fact, it comes up with a whole 
other definition of tax and, therefore, 
another tax system called the adjusted 
financial statement income. This is 
broader than the IRS income. It is not 
fair. It is way too complicated, and it 
is going to hurt employees and con-
sumers. 
Taxable income owed the IRS is 
meant to raise revenue, and, again, it 
includes these incentives or disincen-
tives for certain activity like being 
able to immediately deduct the cost of 
new equipment, if you are a manufac-
turer. We want to encourage that, par-
ticularly in periods of high inflation, so 
we allow them to do that. 
The financial statement income is 
not determined by us. It is not deter-
mined by elected representatives at all. 
In fact, Congress does not have any-
thing to do with it. It is actually deter-
mined by something called the Finan-
cial 
Accounting 
Standards 
Board, 
which is a private nonprofit recognized 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission as the accounting stand-
ard setting for private companies. 
That may work fine for determining 
accounting standards, but this change 
effectively puts these people in control 
of what the corporate tax base is, even 
though they are not elected to any-
thing. That doesn’t make sense. Let’s 
not set up a whole new tax system for 
some companies. Let’s learn from the 
past. 
Back in 1986, when we passed a big 
tax reform bill, they put a book tax in 
place, and it was repealed less than 3 
years later. Why? Because it was 
viewed as unfair, way too complicated, 
and, actually, they thought that you 
shouldn’t have these nonelected offi-
cials deciding what the taxes ought to 
be. 
They said it was bad for the econ-
omy, too, because companies were 
managing to the book tax rather than 
the IRS tax. So let’s learn from the 
past. Why would we want to do that 
again, set up a whole other tax system, 
tax the American economy, tax con-
sumers, tax workers, and do so through 
something that in 1986, we looked at 
and decided this is not working? 
So Democrats will say tonight, Well, 
this new complicated tax system is just 
going to affect big companies. 
That is true. But you know what, big 
companies employ a lot of people, and 
a lot of people are going to be hurt. 
They also sell to a lot of consumers, all 
of us who will be hurt. Last year, there 
were over 200 companies listed on the 
Fortune 500 as meeting the criteria 
that is set out in this legislation. They 
employ over 18 million Americans. It is 
those employees and those who are cus-
tomers who are going to bear the brunt 
of these tax increases as it is passed 
down to them in the form of lower 
wages, lower benefits, and higher prices 
for goods and services. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation, a 
nonpartisan group, just last year said 
they expected 25 percent of these cor-
porate taxes to fall on workers; again, 
this means lower wages. The non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office 
says that employees and workers bear 
more like 70 percent of the burden of 
income taxes, so there is a long list of 
analyses in-between. 
Let’s say between 25 percent and 70 
percent of these taxes are going to fall 
on workers in the form of lower pay 
and lower benefits at a time when 
wages are not keeping up with infla-
tion that is getting higher and higher. 
And, by the way, it is not just wages 
I am talking about; families will now 
face even higher prices as the cost of 
corporate taxes get passed along to 
them. In a study last year performed 
by the business schools at the Univer-
sity of Chicago and Northwestern, they 
found that 31 percent of corporate 
taxes fall on consumers through higher 
retail 
prices. 
Aren’t 
prices 
high 
enough? 
Dems have just added another new 
tax in the past 24 hours. Democrats 
now say we are going to have this com-
plicated tax called an excise tax on 
stock buybacks. Again, this is instead 
of some of the tax they had in the 
other new tax that they put forward 
called the book tax. 
Now, Democrats tonight will talk 
about how taxing buybacks is good be-
cause it somehow hurts Wall Street fat 
cats. Here is the truth: It increases the 
price of stocks to allow buybacks, and 
by taking away that incentive by put-
ting a tax on it, there will be less of it. 
So the reality is this is a tax on work-
ing families, including those trying to 
save for retirement when they are al-
ready dealing with the struggling port-
folios due to the recent economic con-
traction and the record inflation we 
are experiencing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4169 
August 6, 2022 
Fifty-eight percent of Americans own 
stock, and 60 million investors invest 
in an IRA or a 401(k). We want people 
to save for retirement; it is a good 
thing. We want them to have healthy 
retirement. So when Democrats say 
they worry about stock prices going 
up, I have to ask: Are they worried 
about people having a healthy retire-
ment account? 
Again, when companies buy back 
stock, it generally causes that stock to 
go up, which means it makes Ameri-
cans’ retirement accounts that much 
larger. Why is that a problem? The Tax 
Foundation says retirement accounts 
own 37 percent of all corporate stock. 
That is about $81⁄2 trillion in retire-
ment funds, $81⁄2 trillion of retirement 
funds own corporate stock. Americans 
lost about $2 trillion in their IRAs dur-
ing the COVID crisis. Let’s not encour-
age them to lose anymore. 
Some will say, this is just 1 percent. 
Well, we know that once a tax is initi-
ated, it tends to increase. This is the 
camel’s nose under the tent. The first 
income tax in 1913, by the way, was 1 
percent and just on top earners. I think 
a lot of middle-income earners right 
now would be happy to have a tax rate 
that low. 
This type of proposal will impact 
families and their retirement, and for 
that reason, we should not even go 
down this path. Democrats will also 
tax employee stock ownership pro-
grams, or ESOPS, in this package. I 
think some of my colleagues might be 
surprised to hear that. ESOPS are 
plans to give employees ownership of 
their own companies, with tax incen-
tives for the dividends to go to their re-
tirement savings. They are really pop-
ular. 
ESOPS work; they are great. They 
enjoy wide bipartisan support here in 
the Congress. Employees have this 
ownership stake, and because of that, 
those companies tend to do better. Em-
ployees are happier. They are more 
profitable. They are more productive. 
The companies benefit from it. I don’t 
understand why Democrats want to 
punish this ownership structure. Doing 
so will, once again, discourage invest-
ment and hard work, and it could not 
come at a worse time. 
That is why I want to introduce an 
amendment tonight that will exempt 
ESOPS from the minimum book tax. 
This is a commonsense amendment— 
nothing complicated about it. It will 
encourage savings and investment; it is 
good for the country; and I encourage 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who support ESOPS to support the 
amendment. 
I also plan to offer an amendment 
that will increase funding for Customs 
and Border Patrol by $500 million that 
will be used for new technology to de-
tect fentanyl and other dangerous 
drugs that are, unfortunately, flooding 
across our southern border. 
Over 100,000 Americans died of drug 
overdoses last year, the worst year on 
record. Unfortunately, more and more 
people are dying of overdoses, and they 
are dying from this synthetic opioid 
called fentanyl. About two-thirds of 
those overdose deaths were due to 
fentanyl. 
At a time when deadly fentanyl is 
flooding across the border, only 2 per-
cent of cars and only 16 percent of com-
mercial vehicles are being screened. 
Now, these drugs come across the ports 
of entry where only 2 percent of cars 
and 16 percent of trucks are being 
screened. 
They also come between the ports of 
entry, but at a minimum, we should be 
able to do screening of these vehicles 
and trucks. It is a gaping hole in our 
border security, and it has got to be 
fixed. 
This amendment will simply assure 
that the new funds in this bill for the 
Department of Homeland Security bu-
reaucracy, for an office called Readi-
ness, $500 million will be assigned to a 
higher priority, to have Customs and 
Border Protection be able to detect and 
stop deadly fentanyl that is being 
smuggled into this country at record 
levels. 
So this money would stay at the De-
partment of Homeland Security. It will 
instead be used for a more urgent pri-
ority. Let’s be serious about our na-
tional security and this drug crisis we 
face, and let’s give the Border Patrol 
what they need to counter the drug 
cartels and the traffickers. 
Tonight, I also plan to offer an 
amendment to ensure the new postal 
electric vehicles are actually made in 
the United States of America. In this 
bill, there is a $3 billion appropriation 
to the Postal Service. We just went 
through postal reform, as some of you 
know, we provided them additional 
funding that they needed. This is an 
additional $3 billion appropriation to 
buy electric vehicles and charging in-
frastructure. However, there is no re-
quirement that these vehicles be made 
in America, with U.S. batteries and 
other components. 
In other words, the bill uses taxpayer 
funds to buy electric vehicles that can 
be made with Chinese batteries and 
Chinese critical minerals. We know 
that this is counter to everything we 
are trying to do around here. We just 
passed legislation to make us more 
competitive with China. Again, we just 
passed legislation to provide the Postal 
Service with funds for new vehicles, in-
cluding electric vehicles. The Post-
master General just made a decision to 
go from 10 percent electric to 20 per-
cent to 50 percent. That is already hap-
pening. But in that case, there are re-
quirements; in this case, there are not. 
We know that Democrats believe 
that when we are expanding electric 
vehicles, that we ought to ensure that 
these vehicles are being made in Amer-
ica. How do we know that? Because in 
another part of the bill, which is the 
expansion of the electric vehicle tax 
credit, Democrats included new re-
quirements that the tax credit award 
EVs made in the United States with 
American components. 
My amendment would simply apply 
these identical requirements to these 
new electric postal delivery vehicles. 
Both involve taxpayer subsidies. What 
is good for the American driver should 
be good for the Postal Service. 
My hope is this misnamed ‘‘Inflation 
Reduction Act’’ can be stopped before 
it makes things worse, but at least I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to look at these commonsense 
amendments and accept some of these 
amendments. Some, I have laid out, 
and some others, I have talked about 
tonight to improve a flawed bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we 
have just heard a discussion of the 
issue of tax reform, and my colleague 
across the aisle has said there should 
be no corporate minimum tax on cor-
porations, and yet Americans know 
that billionaire companies one after 
the other—some of the most profitable 
companies in our entire country, com-
panies like Amazon—don’t pay a single 
cent in tax. 
They use our legal system. They use 
our road system. They use our edu-
cation system. They use it all in vast 
quantities and don’t contribute a sin-
gle dime. One single ordinary worker 
does more to pay for all of the infra-
structure these massive companies uti-
lize than the company does. 
It is about time corporations that 
make massive profits pay something, 
and 15 percent isn’t even their fair 
share. And it is part of a global agree-
ment to hold corporations accountable, 
so they don’t skip from one country to 
another, to another, to another, evad-
ing everyone everywhere. 
My colleague also said a lot about 
why we should not put a 1 percent tax 
on stock buybacks. Let’s understand 
what stock buybacks are. First of all, a 
president of a company works to get a 
board, and that board is compensated, 
and then that board makes lots of deci-
sions about, well, the welfare of the top 
executives. They set the salaries for 
the top executives, and then they give 
them stock options. 
Now, if you have a stock option and 
then your company buys back stock, 
every share gets more valuable; you 
make a massive amount of money. This 
is a corrupt system. It does nothing to 
further the investment of the company 
and the productivity of America. It 
does nothing to increase the R&D—re-
search 
and 
development—that 
goes 
into new products. It does nothing to 
make their product more price com-
petitive. 
It is ‘‘enrich the rich’’ scheme, and 
putting a 1 percent fee on that to help 
pay for all of the infrastructure the 
companies use is certainly more than 
appropriate. In fact, we should simply 
ban the stock buybacks. This is a very, 
very modest reform in the right direc-
tion. 
It is the case that in this Chamber, 
under the Republican stock provisions,

1 year after another under their tax 
provisions, they have basically enabled 
the billionaires and corporations to es-
cape any contribution to the welfare of 
our country. That is wrong. These tax 
reforms are right, and the healthcare 
provisions will help. 
They are not nearly as powerful as I 
would like to see, certainly. I want to 
negotiate every single drug, the way 
the Veterans’ Administration does, the 
way every foreign country does, every 
developed country does. We should get 
the best prices, not the worst in the de-
veloped world. 
And in climate, while this, again, 
doesn’t do everything I want, the in-
vestments in solar and wind will drive 
a bold, determined transition from fos-
sil fuel energy to renewable energy. 
We have to electrify everything with 
renewable energy. If we do that, set 
that example for the world and work 
with the world, we have some chance of 
humanity tackling this massive prob-
lem of climate chaos that is causing so 
much trouble across our land—from 
the massive floods in Kentucky to the 
forest fires of the Pacific Northwest, 
town after town being burned down. It 
is really America that has to lead the 
way. 
There is a lot more I would like to 
see in this bill, just as my colleague 
from Ohio has a whole series of ideas. 
I filed a lot of amendments, but I 
can’t pull them up tonight. I can’t ask 
for a vote on them because under the 
structure that we are dealing with now, 
anything that changes may result in 
this bill never passing, and so this is 
why, when we come back in the next 
session of Congress, we have to reform 
this Senate so we can do legitimate 
amendments like my colleague from 
Ohio suggested in a process where they 
get due consideration and don’t tor-
pedo the bill under which we are dis-
cussing them. 
Those reforms are so essential be-
cause the arc of this Chamber has been 
one in which individual amendments 
have been incredibly suppressed. It is 
unacceptable. We are all so frustrated 
with the fact that deals are made by 
basically four individuals leading the 
two Chambers off this floor rather than 
determined and responsible debate— 
public, 
transparent 
debate—on 
the 
floor of this Chamber. 
So the right answer is to come back 
and make this place work so that all 
ideas—as my colleague from Ohio list-
ed his, I have my list. I want to add in 
affordable housing. I want to stop all 
the drilling. I want to fund the commu-
nity colleges. I want preschool to be 
counted. I want to fix so that we can 
take the electric vehicle tax credits 
and do even better with them. I want 
to include the two-wheel and the three- 
wheel vehicles. I want to put in the 
summer benefit for food that has been 
so effective in helping so many chil-
dren make it through the summer. But 
I can’t do these things. 
Let’s fix this Senate. Let’s have the 
types of debates we should have, and 
tonight, let’s pass this bill for the right 
steps in the right direction on tax re-
form, on healthcare, and on climate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic whip. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all remaining 
time on the bill be yielded back; that 
there be 2 minutes of debate, equally 
divided, prior to each vote with respect 
to the reconciliation bill; and that fol-
lowing 
the 
disposition 
of 
Sanders 
amendment No. 5210, the following 
amendments be the first Republican 
amendments in order: No. 1, amend-
ment No. 5301, Senator GRAHAM; No. 2, 
amendment No. 5409, Senator BAR-
RASSO; No. 3, amendment No. 5382, Sen-
ator CAPITO; No. 4, amendment No. 
5384, Senator LANKFORD; and No. 5, 
amendment No. 5404, Senator CRAPO. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
There will now be 2 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided. 
The junior Senator from Vermont. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5210 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
the American people are sick and tired 
of being ripped off by the greed of the 
pharmaceutical industry, which makes 
tens of billions of dollars per year in 
profit, charging us by far the highest 
prices in the world for our medicine. 
This bill as currently written allows 
Medicare to negotiate prices with the 
drug companies but not until 4 years 
from now and then for only 10 drugs— 
a tiny fraction of the total. That is a 
very weak proposal and not what the 
American people want. They want us 
to lower prescription drug costs now, 
not in 4 years, and they want all drugs 
covered. The VA has been negotiating 
drug prices for 30 years and pays half— 
half—as much as Medicare pays. 
My amendment is simple. It says 
that Medicare should not pay any more 
than the VA for prescription drugs. If 
we do that, we will cut the cost of 
Medicare prescription drugs in half and 
save $900 billion. 
Please support this amendment. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The senior Senator from South 
Carolina. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. GRAHAM. Well, Madam Presi-
dent, we are off to the races, so I am 
going to make this easy. 
I raise a point of order that the pend-
ing 
amendment 
violates 
section 
313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. 
The 
junior 
Senator 
from 
Vermont. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
pursuant to section 904 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I move to 
waive section 313 of that act for pur-
poses of this amendment, and I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4171 
August 6, 2022 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to the 
Members of the body, if you think 
America needs a new gas tax, then 
your ship has come in. Vote for the 
Democratic bill because, believe it or 
not, these people over there want to 
raise gas taxes right now. 
The last time they tried to help you 
was the American rescue act. And here 
is what the Vice President said: Help 
has arrived for the families who have 
struggled to put food on their table, for 
the small businesses that have strug-
gled to keep their doors open. Help has 
arrived. 
She said that in March. Inflation was 
2.6 percent. Help has arrived. It is 9.1 
percent. 
This bill will increase gas taxes 16.4 
cents on every barrel of imported oil 
and petroleum, and every barrel of 
crude oil found in America, to be re-
fined in America, will have an addi-
tional 
16.4 
cents-per-barrel-tax 
in-
crease. 
This is insane. This is stupid. If you 
like high gas prices, vote for them. If 
you want to lower prices at the pump, 
vote for my amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this 
amendment would strike a four-tenths- 
of-a-cent-per-gallon fee on Big Oil re-
finers that helps pay for the cleanup of 
toxic waste spills, especially important 
to our low-income, historically dis-
advantaged communities. 
One expert analysis found that our 
bill is going to decrease the average 
household’s energy costs by $500 per 
year. So, for many consumers, the 
Superfund fee would be less than $10 a 
year, a fraction of the savings from our 
bill. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5301 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

(Purpose: To eliminate the reinstatement of

The Senator is recognized. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, this is a 
commonsense, straightforward amend-
ment to strike the surcharge on barrels 
of oil, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you very much. 
This gives phony and cynical a bad 
name. They wouldn’t let you do this in 
professional wrestling. If you think 
people are this dumb, you are going to 
be sadly mistaken. 
What she is doing is trying to strike 
the provisions that she just voted 
against, but it requires 60 votes. So she 
can vote for repealing a gas tax she 
just voted against so she will look good 
for the voters. 
If you really wanted to repeal the gas 
tax, the new one indexed for inflation, 
you should have voted for my amend-
ment. What you are doing is deceitful, 
dishonest, and we are going to call you 
out. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators 
are reminded to address each other

Wrong point of order. Let me try

The Senator from Wyoming. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5409 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. BARRASSO. I call up amend-
ment No. 5409 and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. BAR-
RASSO] proposes an amendment numbered 
5409 to amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To require certain additional on-
shore oil and gas lease sales in certain 
states) 
At the end of part 6 of subtitle B of title V, 
add the following: 
SEC. 5026l. MANDATORY ADDITIONAL ONSHORE 
OIL AND GAS LEASE SALES IN CER-
TAIN STATES. 
(a) REQUIREMENT.—Subject to subsections 
(b) and (c), not later than December 31, 2022, 
the Secretary of the Interior (acting through 
the Director of the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment) shall conduct an oil and gas lease sale 
under the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 
et seq.) in each of the States in which the 
Bureau of Land Management conducted lease 
sales in June 2022. 
(b) PARCELS.—The oil and gas lease sales 
required under subsection (a) shall include, 
at a minimum, all parcels— 
(1) that were evaluated under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
4321 et seq.) process for the June 2022 sales; 
but 
(2) that were deferred by the applicable Bu-
reau of Land Management State Director. 
(c) ADDITIONAL LEASE SALES.—The oil and 
gas lease sales required under subsection (a) 
shall be conducted in addition to the quar-
terly oil and gas lease sales required under 
section 17(b)(1)(A) of the Mineral Leasing 
Act (30 U.S.C. 226(b)(1)(A)). 
Mr. BARRASSO. I rise in support of 
the amendment to require the Sec-
retary of the Interior to conduct sup-
plemental onshore oil and gas lease 
sales by the end of 2022. 
The Biden administration went 18 
months 
without 
holding 
quarterly 
lease sales as required by the Mineral 
Leasing Act. 
That failure to hold lease sales has 
contributed to high gasoline and nat-
ural gas prices, record inflation, and 
has increased our dependence on for-
eign adversaries. 
When 
the 
Secretary 
finally 
was 
forced to hold sales in June, she re-
duced the available acreage by 80 per-
cent. 
This amendment would require the 
Secretary to hold supplemental lease 
sales this year, offering the previously 
deferred 
acreage, 
which 
has 
gone 
through multiple rounds already of en-
vironmental review. 
Instead of pleading with dictators in 
other countries to increase oil and gas 
production, we should expand Amer-
ican production. My amendment will 
do just that for people who care about 
the pain at the pump. 
I would ask other Senators to join in 
support. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. This amendment dis-
rupts the carefully negotiated delicate 
balance of this agreement, putting 
really the entire reconciliation vehicle 
at risk. 
Therefore, I would urge my col-
leagues to vote no on the amendment.

graph (A), the Secretary shall apply the na-

RULE
FOR

(f) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendments 
made by this section shall apply to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in the 
richest country on Earth, millions of 
seniors should not have teeth rotting 
in their mouths or be unable to afford 
hearing aids or eyeglasses. 
In America today, the reality is that 
a quarter of Americans 65 and older are 
missing all of their natural teeth, and 
20 percent have untreated dental cav-
ities. 
Further, one in three seniors suffers 
from hearing loss, while 75 percent who 
need a hearing aid cannot afford one. 
And further, it can cost seniors up to 
$300 for a routine eye exam and over 
$200 for a pair of glasses, which many 
seniors simply are unable to afford and 
do without. 
This amendment is simple. It ex-
pands Medicare to provide dental, vi-
sion, and hearing benefits to our sen-
iors. 
This should not be a particularly 
tough vote, given the fact that the last 
poll I saw had 84 percent of the Amer-
ican people in support of this concept. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, yes, I 
would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote simply because 
we are living in a world where it is 
hard to get by. Growing the govern-
ment, I think, will create more infla-
tion. Everything can’t be free because 
we all—it gets to be so free that you 
can’t afford it. 
So you are the same people that told 
us if we passed the American Rescue 
Plan, all would be well. We are at 9.1 
percent inflation. You are increasing 
gas taxes. Now you want to expand 
Medicare. This is going to hurt the 
American people. Stop the madness. 
Vote no.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4178 
August 6, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5382 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 5382 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from West Virginia [Mrs. CAP-
ITO] proposes an amendment numbered 5382 
to amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike provisions concerning 
funding for certain activities under the 
Clean Air Act) 
In section 60105, strike subsection (g). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia is recognized. 
There are 2 minutes, equally divided. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, this 
amendment would strike a provision 
that gives the EPA $45 million in a 
slush fund to use eight different sec-
tions of the Clean Air Act to regulate 
greenhouse gases. The EPA will un-
doubtedly try to use this money to de-
velop rules targeting electricity gen-
eration, 
manufacturing, 
agriculture, 
and other sectors of our economy. 
This will be the first time that Con-
gress has told the EPA to carry out 
many of these Clean Air Act sections 
with 
respect 
to 
greenhouse 
gases. 
There is no doubt that EPA lawyers 
and environmental groups will point to 
this language when they try to con-
vince courts to uphold future over-
reaching climate regulations. 
After the EPA’s recent loss before 
the Supreme Court on the illegal Clean 
Power Plan, we should not be providing 
funds to the Agency that it will inevi-
tably use to undertake more expansive 
and unauthorized rulemakings. This 
$45 million slush fund would be used to 
impose billions of dollars in regulatory 
burdens on our economy and increase 
costs at the worst time for consumers. 
This provision is bad for West Vir-
ginia, and it is bad for America. I urge 
my colleagues to support my amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the 
amendment by our colleague Senator 
CAPITO would strike $45 million in the 
bill that would fund the EPA to use its 
existing narrow Clean Air Act authori-
ties to address greenhouse gas emis-
sions. 
Our colleague sought to argue that 
this provision did not comply with the 
Byrd rule, but the Parliamentarian 
ruled that it does. We are now pre-
sented with an amendment to strike 
the provision altogether. 
The EPA has lots of authorities and 
tools already at its disposal to reach 
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 
no later than midcentury. The quickest 
way we can jump-start government- 
wide climate action is to help empower 
Agencies to use the tools that they al-
ready have. The $45 million in the bill 
before us would help the EPA to do just 
that. 
I spoke earlier today about the ur-
gent need for climate action. We are 
witnessing record heat, more extreme 
weather, and devastating floods on an 
almost daily basis. We should fund the 
EPA to use all of the authorities at its 
disposal to tackle the climate crisis. 
The urgency of this problem demands 
no less. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
opposing the amendment.

ond.

homa. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5384 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
call up my amendment No. 5384 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the amend-
ment by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Oklahoma 
[Mr. 
LANKFORD] proposes an amendment num-
bered 5384 to amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To provide additional funding for 
implementation of title 42) 
At the appropriate place in title IX, insert 
the following: 
SEC. llll. FUNDING FOR TITLE 42 IMPLEMEN-
TATION. 
(a) APPROPRIATION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—In addition to amounts 
otherwise available, there is appropriated to 
the Director of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, out of amounts in the 
Treasury 
not 
otherwise 
appropriated, 
$1,000,000 for fiscal year 2023, for the purpose 
described in paragraph (2). 
(2) USE OF FUNDS.—The Director of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention shall 
use the amounts appropriated under para-
graph (1) for the continued implementation 
of the orders by the Director pursuant to sec-
tion 362 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 265) regarding the suspension of entry 
into the United States of persons from coun-
tries where a quarantinable communicable 
disease exists, until the date that is 120 days 
after the termination of the public health 
emergency declared under section 319 of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) 
with respect to COVID–19, including renew-
als of such emergency. 
(b) 
PREVENTION
AND
PUBLIC
HEALTH 
FUND.—Section 4002(b) of the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 300u– 
11(b)) is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (6), by striking ‘‘each of 
fiscal years 2022 and 2023’’ and inserting ‘‘fis-
cal year 2022’’; 
(2) by redesignating paragraphs (7) through 
(9) as paragraphs (8) through (10), respec-
tively; and 
(3) by inserting after paragraph (6) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(7) for fiscal year 2023, $999,000,000;’’. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
the Biden administration continues to 
declare that we are in a public health 
emergency because of COVID–19. This 
public health emergency, first declared 
in January 2020, has been renewed 10 
times. 
Title 42 is the health authority spe-
cifically designed to prevent people 
from coming into the country during a 
pandemic. It is nonsensical to say that 
we have a COVID health emergency ev-
erywhere but on our southern border. If 
there is a public health emergency in 
this country, then title 42 authority 
must remain in place. 
Title 42 authority is the last line of 
defense that our Border Patrol agents 
have to protect our Nation, and my 
Democratic colleagues said they agreed 
with that idea back in April. The situa-
tion has only worsened since that time 
so surely they will agree with me more 
today. 
I urge the adoption of this amend-
ment, that we would remain consistent 
with title 42 authority in this Nation. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The senior Senator from Wash-
ington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
let’s be clear about what is going on 
here. This amendment is an attempt by 
Republicans to derail our ability to get 
this bill across the finish line and de-
liver for families in our country. 
Title 42 is a public health tool, and 
how it is used should be guided by pub-
lic health experts—looking at data, 
looking 
at 
science—not 
politicians

AMENDMENT NO. 5480 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
call up amendment No. 5480, and I ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Montana [Mr. TESTER] 
proposes 
amendment 
numbered 
5480 
to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a procedure for termi-
nating a determination by Surgeon Gen-
eral to suspend certain entries and imports 
from designated places) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. lll. PUBLIC HEALTH AND BORDER SECU-
RITY. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Public Health and Border Secu-
rity Act of 2022’’. 
(b) TERMINATION OF SUSPENSION OF ENTRIES 
AND IMPORTS FROM DESIGNATED PLACES RE-
LATED TO THE COVID–19 PANDEMIC.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—An order of suspension 
issued under section 362 of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265) as a result of the 
public health emergency relating to the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pan-
demic declared under section 319 of such Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247d) on January 31, 2020, and any 
continuation of such declaration (including 
the continuation described in Proclamation 
9994 on February 24, 2021), shall be lifted not 
earlier than 60 days after the date on which 
the Surgeon General provides written notifi-
cation to the appropriate authorizing and ap-
propriating committees of Congress that 
such public health emergency declaration 
(including the continuation described in 
Proclamation 9994 on February 24, 2021) have 
been terminated. 
(2) PROCEDURES DURING 60-DAY TERMINATION 
WINDOW.— 
(A) PLAN.—Not later than 30 days after the 
date on which a written notification is pro-
vided under paragraph (1) with respect to an 
order of suspension, the Surgeon General, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, and the head of any other Federal 
agency, State, local or Tribal government, or 
nongovernmental organization that has a 
role in managing outcomes associated with 
the suspension, as determined by the Sur-
geon General (or the designee of the Surgeon 
General), shall develop and submit to the ap-
propriate committees of Congress, a plan to 
address any possible influx of entries or im-
ports, as defined in such order of suspension, 
related to the termination of such order. 
(B) FAILURE
TO
SUBMIT.—If a plan under 
subparagraph (A) is not submitted to the ap-
propriate committees of Congress within the 
30-day period described in such subpara-
graph, not later than 7 days after the expira-
tion of such 30-day period, the Secretary 
shall notify the appropriate committees of 
Congress, in writing, of the status of pre-
paring such a plan and the timing for sub-
mission as required under subparagraph (A). 
The termination of order related to such 
plan shall be delayed until that date that is 
30 days after the date on which such plan is 
submitted to such committees. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, this 
amendment is actually quite simple. It 
is to make sure that we have a com-
prehensive plan in place before title 42 
is lifted. Very straightforward. This is 
not whether title 42 should ever be lift-
ed or not; rather, it is about making 
sure that we are doing the right thing 
at the right time, which I believe is 
when the COVID–19 national emer-
gency is lifted and when we have a plan 
in place. 
I would urge a ‘‘yea’’ vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The junior Senator from Okla-
homa. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
well, I anticipate there will be a few 
people who are going to vote for it be-
fore they vote against it, in this case. 
What this is, is this is actually my 
title 42 bill, except with one little 
tweak in it. It takes it out of Byrd 
compliance. So this allows any indi-
vidual to be able to vote for this one 
but actually oppose the one that would 
have actually implemented the policy 
that was actually Byrd-compliant. 
This is the reason people get so angry 
at Washington, DC, because people will 
say: Oh, I didn’t really mean to do 
that; I meant to do this. 
Here is my concern. I think anyone 
should ask everyone, if they voted one 
way one time and one way another, 
what is different on this, because here 
is what I think happens next. What I 
think is about to happen is, someone is 
going to stand and they are going to 
call a point of order on this and to say 
this is not compliant with the Byrd 
rule. And people are going to say: I 
tried to get it done, but that Parlia-
mentarian just knocked it down. So 
that is what I bet happens next. We 
will see. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator’s time has expired. 
The Democratic whip. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
raise a point of order that the pending 
amendment does not produce a change 
in outlays or revenues and therefore 
violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The senior Senator from Mon-
tana. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, be-
fore I make my motion, I would just 
say we were here earlier this week on a 
different bill that had nothing to do 
with the Budget Act. 
Madam President, pursuant to sec-
tion 904 of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, I move to waive section 313 
of that act for the purpose of this pro-
vision, and I would ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion. 
The clerk will call the roll.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. On this vote, the yeas are 56, and 
the nays are 44. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is not agreed 
to. 
The point of order is sustained, and 
the amendment falls. 
The Senator from Idaho. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5404 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I call 
up my amendment, No. 5404, and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the amend-
ment by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Idaho [Mr. CRAPO] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 5404 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prevent the use of additional 
Internal Revenue Service funds from being 
used for audits of taxpayers with taxable 
incomes below $400,000 in order to protect 
low- and middle-income earning American 
taxpayers from an onslaught of audits 
from an army of new Internal Revenue 
Service auditors funded by an unprece-
dented, nearly $80,000,000,000, infusion of 
new funds) 
At the end of section 10301, add the fol-
lowing: 
(c) LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE INTERNAL 
REVENUE SERVICE.—None of the funds appro-
priated under subsection (a)(1) may be used 
to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes 
below $400,000. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, my 
amendment will guard against squeez-
ing middle-class taxpayers. Supersized 
IRS funding will squeeze billions from 
the middle-class workers and small 
businesses through ramped-up audits. 
My colleagues on the other side and 
the President all say that that is not 
intended by the bill, and, in fact, the 
bill itself says that is not intended. But 
this is not enforceable language, and 
everyone knows that the targeted 
money in the bill cannot be achieved 
unless the middle class—people with 
incomes under $400,000—are hit with a 
wave of new audits. 
We also know that the Congressional 
Budget Office will score that, showing 
that there is no way to accomplish the 
objectives of this bill unless you audit 
the middle class. 
My bill simply puts in some teeth be-
hind what is admitted by everyone to 
be the intention of the legislation, to 
say that none of the new IRS funding 
may be used to audit those earning 
below $400,000. 
If my amendment is not adopted, bil-
lions in taxes will be squeezed out of 
taxpayers earning below $400,000, ac-
cording to the CBO, including middle- 
income workers and small businesses. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The senior Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise 
in opposition to my friend’s amend-
ment. We all agree here that taxpayers 
with less than $400,000 in taxable in-
come should not face a tax increase. 
And there is language already—and I 
would like to note this—in the enforce-
ment section of the bill that says just 
that. 
But the Crapo amendment goes much 
further than that. It applies—and I 
quote here—‘‘to taxpayers with taxable 
income.’’ 
And as Americans have learned re-
cently, billionaires often have little or 
no taxable income for years on end. 
So under this amendment, the bil-
lionaires who live off their borrowings 
would be immune from audit, and that 
would invite further tax avoidance. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment.

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I have a motion at the desk. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. SCOTT] 
moves to commit the bill to the Committee 
on Finance with instructions. 
The junior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask that the reading be dis-
pensed with. 
[Mr. SCOTT of Florida] moves to commit 
the bill H.R. 5376 to the Committee on Fi-
nance of the Senate with instructions to re-
port the same back to the Senate in 3 days, 
not counting any day in which the Senate is 
not in session, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would prohibit the hiring of any addi-
tional Internal Revenue Service agents pur-
suant to section 10301(a)(1)(A)(i)(II) until 
such time as at least 18,000 additional agents 
(over the number of such agents employed as 
of the date of enactment) are hired by the 
United States Border Patrol. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, the historic crisis that the Biden 
administration has created on the 
southern border by failing to enforce 
our laws is threatening the national se-
curity of the United States every day. 
Savage cartels own our U.S. border 
now. This fiscal year, more than 2 mil-
lion people have illegally entered the 
United States. Drugs are pouring into 
our communities and killing thousands 
and thousands of Americans. It must 
end now. 
Sadly, Democrats are still doing 
nothing to support the Border Patrol 
or actually securing the border. In-
stead, they want to supersize the IRS 
and add 87,000 more agents to hunt 
down and audit even more families and 
small businesses. 
My amendment says that before one 
additional IRS agent is hired, we must 
give Border Patrol the support it needs 
and double its forces with 18,000 more 
Border Patrol agents. It is time to first 
secure the border and second, stop the 
Democrats from supersizing the IRS. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for my 
commonsense amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4181 
August 6, 2022 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The senior Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
gather that this is the first of the mo-
tions to commit this legislation back 
to committee. 
I want my colleagues to understand 
what this is really all about. These mo-
tions to commit are motions to kill 
this bill, period. And what that means 
is: Let’s try to do everything we can to 
delay Democrats from being able to de-
liver for the American people lower 
prescription drug costs for the elderly, 
lower healthcare premiums, lower car-
bon emissions, lower energy costs, less 
tax cheating by the wealthy. 
The Senate ought to be moving this 
legislation forward instead of trying to 
kill the bill through these motions to 
commit. 
One last point, I gather we are going 
to have a bit more of this discussion. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator’s time has expired. 
Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous con-
sent for 30 seconds of additional time. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Mr. COTTON. Objection. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard.

AMENDMENT NO. 5389 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
call up my amendment No. 5389 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MARSHALL] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5389 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To protect patient access to cur-
rent and future treatments for a range of 
serious conditions, such as cancer, Alz-
heimer’s disease, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson’s 
disease, and sickle cell disease, among nu-
merous others) 
At the end of title I, add the following: 
Subtitle E—Ensuring Patient Access to Drugs 
and Biological Products That Treat Serious 
Conditions 
SEC. 14001. ENSURING PATIENT ACCESS TO 
DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS 
THAT TREAT SERIOUS CONDITIONS. 
Section 1192(e)(3) of the Social Security 
Act, as added by section 11001, is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subpara-
graphs: 
‘‘(D) SIX
PROTECTED
CLASSES.—A covered 
part D drug in a category or class that is 
identified under section 1860D–4(b)(3)(G)(iv). 
‘‘(E) BREAKTHROUGH THERAPIES.—A drug or 
biological product designated under section 
506(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act (21 U.S.C. 356(a)) as a break-
through therapy and approved under section 
505 of such Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
262).’’. 
SEC. 14002. REDUCTION OF ADDITIONAL IRS 
FUNDING FOR ENFORCEMENT AND 
OPERATIONS. 
Section 10301(a)(1)(A)(i) of this Act is 
amended— 
(1) 
in 
subclause 
(II), 
by 
striking 
‘‘$45,637,400,000’’ 
and 
inserting 
‘‘$10,326,400,000’’; and 
(2) 
in 
subclause 
(III), 
by 
striking 
‘‘$25,326,400,000’’ and inserting ‘‘$326,400,000’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, this 
is a reckless inflation bill that will in-
crease drug prices. Yes, you can write 
that down. Just like the ACA has driv-
en up healthcare costs, this bill will in-
crease drug prices. 
With a limited window to recoup 
R&D, manufacturers will have to in-
crease their launch prices. It will also 
eliminate incentives for generics to 
come to market and gain market share 
by pricing lower than the branded 
product. 
Perhaps even worse, this bill will 
delay, if not eliminate, new innovative 
drugs for life-threatening illnesses, 
like Alzheimer’s and cancers. This is 
why our amendment excludes two cat-
egories of drugs from price controls: 
Medicare Part D’s six protected classes 
and the FDA’s breakthrough therapy 
designation drugs. 
By voting ‘‘yes,’’ you will be pro-
tecting patients with mental illness, 
organ transplants, Alzheimer’s, can-
cers, and HIV. A ‘‘no’’ vote is a vote to 
never see a cure for Alzheimer’s. 
Rather than a healthcare system 
that offers Americans breakthrough 
medicines, this reckless tax-and-spend 
bill will force Americans to settle for 
end-of-life care, and that is just wrong. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I oppose 
this amendment for two reasons. The 
first is, it would water down the new 
negotiations program, so it would be 
harder to negotiate over the most ex-
pensive drugs in Medicare today, in-
cluding cancer drugs, which are at the 
top of our list. Second, it would water 
down the efforts at the Internal Rev-
enue Service to beef up tax enforce-
ment against wealthy tax cheats. 
I would urge opposition to the Mar-
shall amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4182 
August 6, 2022 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call 
up amendment No. 5209, and I ask that 
it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Vermont [Mr. SANDERS], 
for himself and Mr. MERKLEY, proposes an 
amendment numbered 5209 to amendment 
No. 5194. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the 
driving force behind the fight against 
climate change has been young people 
here in the United States and abroad. 
They have marched. They have dem-
onstrated. 
They 
demanded 
institu-
tional disinvestment in fossil fuel com-
panies. In short, they have fought for a 
world in which they and their kids and 
grandchildren could live in a healthy 
and habitable planet. 
This legislation invests some $300 bil-
lion in energy efficiency and sustain-
able energy, and that is a good thing. 
But it invests very little in giving our 
younger generation the opportunities 
to roll up their sleeves and get to work 
in moving our energy system away 
from the fossil fuel which is destroying 
our planet. 
This amendment invests $30 billion in 
a Civilian Conservation Corps, which 
would create 400,000 jobs for young peo-
ple. They will be paid a living wage, 
given benefits toward higher education, 
and be trained for good union, clean- 
energy jobs. 
Let us stand with the young people 
who have led the fight against climate 
change. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for the Ci-
vilian Conservation Corps. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would 
urge a no. This has been tried before by 
my colleague Senator SANDERS. This 
would give hundreds of thousands of 
people enlisting free housing, free food, 
transportation, educational costs. 
We have a weak economy. Every time 
I rise to speak, we ruin the government 
in a different way. If you really want 
to help the American people, secure 
their border. If you want to hire any-
body new, hire a Border Patrol agent, 
not 87,000 IRS agents, not a climate 
corps. 
I know these are well-intentioned, 
but we are living in a very tenuous 
time for the American people, and 
their needs are not being met tonight. 
Every problem they have is being made 
worse. We don’t need a climate corps 
right now, quite frankly. We need to 
secure a broken border before terror-
ists come across and kill a bunch of us. 
Vote no. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5209 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
Mr. SANDERS. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll.

NOT VOTING—1

The amendment (No. 5209) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5383 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
(Purpose: To expedite consideration 
of permits and provide regulatory cer-
tainty for infrastructure and energy 
projects.) 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 5383 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from West Virginia [Mrs. CAP-
ITO], for herself and Mr. INHOFE, proposes an 
amendment numbered 5383 to No. Amend-
ment No. 5194. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to 
offer a commonsense permitting re-
form amendment. There has been a lot 
of talk and promises about a supposed 
deal or fixing our Nation’s broken per-
mitting system, but we have yet to see 
any legislative text. 
My amendment delivers these re-
forms right now. Among these reforms 
are provisions that reduce delays and 
environmental reviews, generally to 2 
years or less, while maintaining pro-
tections. Eliminating regulatory hur-
dles, which are now driving higher gas-
oline and energy costs, and imple-
menting the one Federal decision— 
these are things Democrats say they 
will support eventually. Let’s tackle 
inflation, permitting, and energy sup-
ply challenges right here tonight. Let’s 
finish the Mountain Valley Pipeline 
now. 
Americans can’t wait, and no one can 
build back better if we can’t build any-
thing at all. I urge my colleagues to 
vote yes on the amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in opposition to this amendment, 
which would make sweeping changes to 
bedrock 
environmental 
laws. 
This 
amendment would modify the regu-
latory authorities of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency and mul-
tiple other Agencies. It would under-
mine protection of our water quality, 
weaken air quality protections, harm 
wildlife, and would have significant im-
pacts on vulnerable communities. 
At a time when we need to be moving 
toward stable clean energy sources, it 
would focus instead on fracking and 
would prohibit us from considering the 
impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in 
Federal decisions. 
And thus, I urge my colleagues to 
vote no. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. President, I raise a point of order 
that the pending amendment violates 
section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to section 904 of the Congressional 
Budget Act and relevant budget resolu-
tions, I move to waive, and I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion to waive. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). On this vote, the yeas are 49, 
the nays are 50. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is not agreed 
to. 
The point of order is sustained, and 
the amendment falls. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5421 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
(Purpose: To amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to modify the max-
imum capital gains tax rate, to provide 
a partial exclusion for interest received 
by individuals, to provide inflation ad-
justments for certain tax benefits, and 
for other purposes.) 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask to call up 
amendment No. 5421, and I ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Iowa [Mr. GRASSLEY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5421 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments’’.) 
Mr. GRASSLEY. It is 4:50 a.m., and I 
want all the people who thought that 
inflation was going to be transitory to 
understand that it is persistent, and 
that persistence of inflation has hurt 
the Tax Code that tries to help middle- 
class America. 
So my amendment fixes this by pro-
viding inflation relief to the middle 
class by increasing family and edu-
cation tax provisions to account for 
Biden inflation. 
Moreover, the bill includes important 
savings incentives that will enable 
middle-class Americans to save tax- 
free, ensuring that they aren’t taxed on 
phantom income resulting from infla-
tion. 
So I urge my Members to support 
this. Particularly when you have in 
this Tax Code things that benefit the 
rich who can afford Teslas for $80,000, 
you can surely do something for mid-
dle-class America. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, unfortu-
nately, this amendment is just bad 
news. This amendment lowers capital 
gains taxes, and it is more tax give-
aways to the most fortunate. 
And if you are a wealthy tax cheat, 
you can rest easy because Republican 
budget cuts at the IRS mean you can 
get away with breaking the law scot- 
free. I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Do I have some 
time left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5421 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment.

ond.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Maine [Ms. COLLINS] 
moves to commit the bill to the Committee 
on Finance with instructions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading of 
the motion be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The motion to commit is as follows: 
[Ms. COLLINS] moves to commit the bill 
H.R. 5376 to the Committee on Finance of the 
Senate with instructions to report the same 
back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting 
any day in which the Senate is not in ses-
sion, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) that none of the amounts made avail-
able under section 10301 shall be used to hire 
any new employee until 90 percent of Inter-
nal Revenue Service employees employed as 
of the date of the enactment of this Act are 
working in person at an Internal Revenue 
Service office or job site. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the un-
derlying bill provides billions of dollars 
to the IRS to hire 87,000 additional 
auditors, yet more than 50 percent of 
the current IRS employees have yet to 
return to their offices or work sites. 
Here are the consequences: Four out 
of five phone calls from taxpayers go 
unanswered; 21 million returns have 
not been processed; refunds are taking 
6 months or more. 
My motion would simply prohibit the 
IRS from using these billions of dollars 
to add 87,000 new employees prior to 
bringing 90 percent of their workforce 
back to the office. 
I would note that that 87,000 number 
is more than the combined employees 
at the Pentagon, the State Depart-
ment, the FBI, and the Border Patrol 
agents combined. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this mo-
tion is meant to delay or kill this bill. 
If adopted, it would harm the IRS’s 
ability to carry out its duties by pre-
venting the Agency from hiring new 
workers. 
Federal employees are returning to 
in-person work, but Agencies need 
flexibility that telework and remote 
work provide to compete with the pri-
vate sector, retain qualified workers, 
and serve the American people effec-
tively. 
Telework can also ensure Federal 
employees can continue to serve the 
people and stay safe if COVID variants 
or other public health threats disrupt 
in-person work. 
Remote and telework options allow 
the IRS to hire the workforce they 
need across the entire country so they 
can crack down on tax cheats and 
make sure big corporations are paying 
their fair share. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
motion so we can pass this bill today. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that following disposition of the 
Collins motion to commit, the fol-
lowing amendments be the next Repub-
lican amendments in order: Kennedy 
amendment No. 5387, and Rubio motion 
to commit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

The

OFFICER 
(Mr.

AMENDMENT NO. 5387 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call 
up my amendment No. 5387 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KENNEDY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5387 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To require oil and gas lease sales 
in the outer Continental Shelf) 
At the appropriate place in subtitle B of 
title V, insert the following: 
SEC. 
502lll. 
MANDATORY 
OUTER 
CONTI-
NENTAL SHELF OIL AND GAS LEASE 
SALES. 
(a) GULF
OF MEXICO OIL
AND GAS LEASE 
SALES.— 
(1) REQUIREMENT.—Subject to paragraph 
(2), the Secretary of the Interior (acting 
through the Director of the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management) (referred to in this sec-
tion as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall conduct not 
fewer than 10 area-wide oil and gas lease 
sales under the Outer Continental Shelf 
Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) during the 
period beginning on July 1, 2022, and ending 
on June 30, 2027. 
(2) SCHEDULE.—Not fewer than 2 area-wide 
oil and gas lease sales required under para-
graph (1) shall be held each year during the 
period described in that paragraph in the fol-
lowing planning areas of the Gulf of Mexico 
Region of the outer Continental Shelf, as de-
scribed in the 2017–2022 Outer Continental 
Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final 
Program (November 2016): 
(A) The Central Gulf of Mexico Planning 
Area. 
(B) The Western Gulf of Mexico Planning 
Area. 
(b) 
COOK
INLET
OIL
AND
GAS
LEASE 
SALES.—The Secretary shall conduct not 
fewer than 1 oil and gas lease sale under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 
1331 et seq.) in the Cook Inlet Planning Area 
of the Alaska Region of the outer Conti-
nental Shelf, as described in the 2017–2022 
Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing 
Proposed Final Program (November 2016), 
during the period beginning on July 1, 2022, 
and ending on June 30, 2027. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on 
March 31 of this year, my two friends 
Senator JOE
MANCHIN
and Senator 
MARK KELLY wrote to President Biden: 
We are writing to urge you to develop and 
implement a new 5-year program for oil and 
gas production in the Gulf of Mexico without 
delay. 
My amendment would fulfill that re-
quest and make it a congressional di-
rective. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, this 
leasing requirement would be in addi-
tion to the leasing that is already re-
quired by this bill, with 75 percent of 
offshore leased acres not yet being used 
to produce oil and gas. Opening up 
more acres to leasing is unnecessary. 
The main thing is that the passage of 
this amendment would jeopardize the 
whole package. 
Therefore, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I 
have any time left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty 
seconds. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all my 
amendment does is to take Senator 
MANCHIN’s letter and Senator KELLY’s 
letter—well-written, 
well-reasoned— 
and make it a congressional directive. 
That is all it does. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5387

MOTION TO COMMIT WITH INSTRUCTIONS 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. RUBIO] 
moves to commit the bill to the Committee 
on the Judiciary with instructions. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading be 
dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The motion is as follows: 
Mr. RUBIO moves to commit the bill H.R. 
5376 to the Committee on the Judiciary of 
the Senate with instructions to report the 
same back to the Senate in 3 days, not 
counting any day in which the Senate is not 
in session, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would increase funding to ensure that— 
(A) prosecutors are addressing violent 
crime by ensuring the appropriate pretrial 
detention of dangerous criminals; and 
(B) law enforcement is addressing crime. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I don’t 
think I need to tell anybody here that 
our work is at its best when it is fo-
cused on what people care about. Let 
me tell you what people care about. 
They don’t care as much about buying 
solar panels and electric cars as they 
do about not having to live in a com-
munity where violent crime is rampant 
and you have some crazy prosecutor 
who refuses to put people in jail, who 
refuses to prosecute entire categories 
of crime. 
People are worried about that, and 
rightfully so. And it is happening. We 
have these beautiful cities that were 
once world-class cities that have be-
come unlivable all over this country 
because we have these lunatic prosecu-
tors that have decided that there are 
entire categories of crime they will not 
prosecute.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4185 
August 6, 2022 
That is the kind of stuff we should be 
working on here tonight, all night 
long. If you want to spend all night 
working on something, work on that. 
Don’t waste time on stuff that doesn’t 
matter to real people working every 
single day who are not going to be driv-
ing an electric car next year or the 
year after that, but they might get 
mugged, but they might be a victim of 
a violent crime. 
So what this does is it sends it to the 
Judiciary Committee and asks them, in 
3 days, come back with some ideas 
about how you can spend just a little 
bit of these billions of dollars that we 
are throwing away on this garbage— 
how we can spend a little bit of that 
money to put criminals in jail so 
Americans no longer have to live in 
fear in their communities. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the sen-
ior Senator from Florida says we 
should stop our efforts on reconcili-
ation until we put money in law en-
forcement. So we checked the record. 
When we put billions in local commu-
nities for law enforcement in the 
American Rescue Plan, the senior Sen-
ator from Florida voted no. 
And when it came to the Omnibus 
bill and Byrne grants and COPS money 
that local organizations and law en-
forcement needed so they could be 
stronger and fight crime, 31 Repub-
licans voted no, including the senior 
Senator from Florida. 
So I would suggest we vote no on his 
amendment. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, do I have 
time remaining? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
amendments be the next Republican 
amendments in order: 5316, Lee; 5418, 
Shelby; Motion to Commit, Tim Scott; 
5263, Cruz; 5425, Daines; 5361, Ernst; 
5360, Fischer; 5265, Cruz; 5385, Kennedy;

parents; further, that the Sanders 
amendment No. 5208 occur following 
the Scott motion to commit; and Sand-
ers No. 5281 following the Daines 
amendment No. 5425. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Utah. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5316 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up my 
amendment No. 5316 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 5316. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To reduce funding for home energy 
performance based, whole-house rebates 
and to provide funding for supplemental 
payments under the payments in lieu of 
taxes program) 
At the appropriate place in subtitle B of 
title V, insert the following: 
SEC. 502ll. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER 
THE PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF TAXES 
PROGRAM. 
In addition to amounts otherwise avail-
able, there is appropriated to the Secretary 
for fiscal year 2022, out of any money in the 
Treasury 
not 
otherwise 
appropriated, 
$460,000,000, to remain available through Sep-
tember 30, 2031, to provide supplemental pay-
ments to general units of local government 
for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2031 
under chapter 69 of title 31, United States 
Code, with the amount of the supplemental 
payment for each fiscal year to be deter-
mined by the Secretary, based on the propor-
tional share of the payment received by the 
general unit of local government under that 
chapter for the applicable fiscal year. 
SEC. 502ll. REDUCTION OF APPROPRIATION 
FOR HOME ENERGY PERFORMANCE- 
BASED, WHOLE-HOUSE REBATES. 
Notwithstanding section 50121(a)(1), the 
amount appropriated under that section 
shall be $3,840,000,000. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, across the 
Nation, local governments are strug-
gling to support their constituents. 
These frontline public servants provide 
for the safety and well-being of their 
friends and neighbors, typically using 
funds 
derived 
from 
local 
property 
taxes. 
However, in many counties, these 
Federal neighbors of sorts don’t pay 
property taxes, but they draw heavily 
on the resources made available by 
these 
local 
governments. 
Rescuing 
hikers, paving roads, addressing forest 
fires—these are just a few of the vital 
services that these communities honor-
ably provide even though they receive 
little to no compensation for them. 
My amendment would institute a 
supplemental PILT Program—payment 
in lieu of taxes—an additional PILT 
payment increasing funds by nearly 10 
percent. It would not make these com-
munities completely whole by pro-
viding true tax equivalency, but it 
would make a huge difference. If Amer-
icans want to continue to safely enjoy 
our national parks, monuments, for-
ests, and general landscape, we must 
ensure this program, PILT, continues 
to serve as a reliable source of income 
as property taxes would were Federal 
lands subject to property tax. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment from the Senator of Utah. 
This would take out one of the provi-
sions in the bill which will directly 
help homeowners save money on their 
heating bills and on their cooling bills. 
It does so by giving them a rebate for 
home energy efficiency improvements, 
and then they will save for the rest of 
their lives in their home. 
I also find it a little ironic this would 
put money in local governments, which 
our Republican colleagues said have re-
ceived too much money under the 
American Rescue Plan, and you have 
been trying to claw that back. 
I would urge my colleagues to stick 
with the provision in the bill. It is an 
important part of the bill that both 
provides consumers with savings and to 
address the climate crisis. 
I urge my colleagues to reject the 
amendment.

The amendment (No. 5316) was re-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5418 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 5418 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Alabama [Mr. SHELBY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5418 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To end the President’s War on Coal 
through the approval of coal leases) 
At the end of part 6 of subtitle B of title V, 
add the following: 
SEC. 5026lllll. MANDATORY LEASING FOR 
CERTAIN QUALIFIED APPLICATIONS. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) COAL
LEASE.—The term ‘‘coal lease’’ 
means a lease entered into by the United 
States as lessor, through the Bureau of Land 
Management, and the applicant on Bureau of 
Land Management Form 3400-012. 
(2) 
QUALIFIED
APPLICATION.—The 
term 
‘‘qualified application’’ means any applica-
tion pending under the lease by application 
program administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management pursuant to the Mineral Leas-
ing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) and subpart 
3425 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations 
(as in effect on October 1, 2021), for which the 
environmental review process under the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) has commenced. 
(b) MANDATORY LEASING
AND OTHER RE-
QUIRED APPROVALS.—As soon as practicable 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall promptly— 
(1) with respect to each qualified applica-
tion— 
(A) if not previously published for public 
comment, publish a draft environmental as-
sessment, as required under the National En-
vironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
et seq.) and any applicable implementing 
regulations; 
(B) finalize the fair market value of the 
coal tract for which a lease by application is 
pending; 
(C) take all intermediate actions necessary 
to grant the qualified application; and 
(D) grant the qualified application; and 
(2) with respect to previously awarded coal 
leases, grant any additional approvals of the 
Department of the Interior or any bureau, 
agency, or division of the Department of the 
Interior required for mining activities to 
commence. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, my 
amendment requires that the Sec-
retary of the Interior—requires that he 
complete, or she, pending coal lease ap-
plications under the Bureau of Land 
Management. 
I believe we cannot allow the Biden 
administration to block the mining of 
our own essential energy resources and 
building materials. 
I urge my colleagues to support our 
coal miners and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
amendment. 
Basically, the amendment would re-
quire that the Secretary of the Interior 
to complete pending coal lease proc-
esses for both metallurgical and ther-
mal coal. 
Currently, the administration has 
paused the Lease by Application pro-
gram for Federal coal leases at the Bu-
reau of Land Management and so forth. 
It does not change the law. It simply 
seeks to raise revenue by accelerating 
and ensuring approval of leases that 
are currently paused by the Depart-
ment of the Interior. 
It makes a lot of sense to the Amer-
ican people, and it will put a lot of peo-
ple back to work. 
I urge adoption. Amen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this 
amendment does require that the Sec-
retary of the Interior grant leases for 
coal mining, but granting more leases 
for coal mining is going to do nothing 
for our coal miners today because we 
are in the situation where the existing 
coal mines are looking for more cus-
tomers. That is the challenge; not 
more leases. 
So I know that if this was something 
that would help the coal miners, that 
it would already be in this bill, given 
the knowledge and understanding of 
my colleague from West Virginia. 
So jeopardizing the employment of 
existing coal miners is certainly not in 
the interest of any of us, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote no on this amend-
ment.

Mr. SCOTT OF South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the reading be dispensed with. 
The motion to commit is as follows: 
Mr. SCOTT
of South Carolina moves to 
commit the bill H.R. 5376 to the Committee 
on Finance of the Senate with instructions 
to report the same back to the Senate in 3 
days, not counting any day in which the Sen-
ate is not in session, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; 
(2) eliminate additional Internal Revenue 
Service funding for enforcement; and 
(3) establish a child opportunity tax credit 
for individuals that— 
(A) addresses the learning loss of students 
as a result of prolonged school closures; and 
(B) does not result in a projected revenue 
loss over the 10-year budget window of more 
than $45,637,400,000.

letters you never want to see in your 
mailbox—bigger than the Pentagon, 
the State Department, the FBI, and 
the Border Patrol combined. 
Instead, what my motion does is that 
it would take $45 billion from enforce-
ment and give it to parents so that 
they can help their kids make up for 
the learning loss that occurred during 
the pandemic. 
And oh, by the way, when you think 
about the size of the IRS and when you 
think about the enforcement, realize 
that according to the CBO, 90 percent 
of the targeting would be on household 
incomes under $200,000. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, once 
again, this sends the bill back to com-
mittee and kills Democratic efforts to 
reduce the cost of prescription medi-
cine, reduce health insurance pre-
miums, reduce carbon emissions, and 
crack down on wealthy tax cheats. And 
if you are a wealthy tax cheat, you can 
rest easily because Republican budget 
cuts at the IRS mean that you can get 
away with breaking the law scot-free. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, how much time do I have 
left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two sec-
onds. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Two 
seconds or 22 seconds? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two sec-
onds. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, what we know already is 
that 9.1 percent of inflation is already 
ravaging middle-income Americans. I 
cannot believe that we will not take 
the time and do what is best for the 
American people, and especially those 
making under $200,000.

of— 
‘‘(A) 18 percent of so much of the taxable 
income as does not exceed $400,000, 
‘‘(B) 21 percent of so much of the taxable

TION FOR DIVIDENDS RECEIVED.—

ed by striking ‘‘50 percent’’ and inserting ‘‘60

PORATIONS.—Section 243(c)(1) is amended— 
(A) prior to amendment by subparagraph 
(B), by striking ‘‘65 percent’’ and inserting 
‘‘72.5 percent’’, and 
(B) by striking ‘‘50 percent’’ and inserting 
‘‘60 percent’’. 
(c) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 1561 
is amended— 
(1) by amending subsection (a) to read as 
follows: 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The component mem-
bers of a controlled group of corporations on 
a December 31 shall, for their taxable years 
which include such December 31, be limited 
for purposes of this subtitle to— 
‘‘(1) amounts in each taxable income 
bracket in the subparagraphs of section 
11(b)(1) which do not aggregate more than 
the maximum amount in each such bracket 
to which a corporation which is not a compo-
nent member of a controlled group is enti-
tled, and 
‘‘(2) one $250,000 ($150,000 if any component 
member is a corporation described in section 
535(c)(2)(B)) amount for purposes of com-
puting the accumulated earnings credit 
under section 535(c)(2) and (3). 
The amounts specified in paragraph (1) shall 
be divided equally among the component 
members of such group on such December 31 
unless all of such component members con-
sent (at such time and in such manner as the 
Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) to 
an apportionment plan providing for an un-
equal allocation of such amounts. The 
amounts specified in paragraph (2) shall be 
divided equally among the component mem-
bers of such group on such December 31 un-
less the Secretary prescribes regulations per-
mitting an unequal 
allocation 
of 
such 
amounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in 
applying the last sentence of section 11(b)(1) 
to such component members, the taxable in-
come of all such component members shall 
be taken into account and any increase in 
tax under such last sentence shall be divided 
among such component members in the same 
manner as amounts under paragraph (1).’’, 
and 
(2) by striking ‘‘ACCUMULATED
EARNINGS 
CREDIT’’ in the heading and inserting ‘‘CER-
TAIN MULTIPLE TAX BENEFITS’’. 
(d) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall apply to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
(e) NORMALIZATION REQUIREMENTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—A normalization method 
of accounting shall not be treated as being 
used with respect to any public utility prop-
erty for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the tax-
payer, in computing its cost of service for 
ratemaking purposes and reflecting oper-
ating results in its regulated books of ac-
count, reduces the tax reserve deficit less 
rapidly or to a lesser extent than such re-
serve would be reduced under the average 
rate assumption method. 
(2) ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CERTAIN TAX-
PAYERS.—If, as of the first day of the taxable 
year that includes the date of enactment of 
this Act— 
(A) the taxpayer was required by a regu-
latory agency to compute depreciation for 
public utility property on the basis of an av-
erage life or composite rate method, and 
(B) the taxpayer’s books and underlying 
records did not contain the vintage account 
data necessary to apply the average rate as-
sumption method, 
the taxpayer will be treated as using a nor-
malization method of accounting if, with re-
spect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer uses 
the alternative method for public utility 
property that is subject to the regulatory 
authority of that jurisdiction. 
(3) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this sub-
section— 
(A) TAX RESERVE DEFICIT.—The term ‘‘tax 
reserve deficit’’ means the excess of— 
(i) the amount which would be the balance 
in the reserve for deferred taxes (as described 
in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986, or section 167(l)(3)(G)(ii) of 
such Code as in effect on the day before the 
date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986) if the amount of such reserve were 
determined by assuming that the corporate 
rate increases provided in the amendments 
made by this section were in effect for all 
prior periods, over 
(ii) the balance in such reserve as of the 
day before such corporate rate increases 
take effect. 
(B) AVERAGE RATE ASSUMPTION METHOD.— 
The average rate assumption method is the 
method under which the excess in the re-
serve for deferred taxes is reduced over the 
remaining lives of the property as used in its 
regulated books of account which gave rise 
to the reserve for deferred taxes. Under such 
method, if timing differences for the prop-
erty reverse, the amount of the adjustment 
to the reserve for the deferred taxes is cal-
culated by multiplying— 
(i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes 
for the property to the aggregate timing dif-
ferences for the property as of the beginning 
of the period in question, by 
(ii) the amount of the timing differences 
which reverse during such period. 
(C) 
ALTERNATIVE
METHOD.—The 
‘‘alter-
native method’’ is the method in which the 
taxpayer— 
(i) computes the tax reserve deficit on all 
public utility property included in the plant 
account on the basis of the weighted average 
life or composite rate used to compute depre-
ciation for regulatory purposes, and 
(ii) reduces the tax reserve deficit ratably 
over the remaining regulatory life of the 
property. 
(4) TREATMENT
OF
NORMALIZATION
VIOLA-
TION.—If, for any taxable year ending after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
taxpayer does not use a normalization meth-
od of accounting, such taxpayer shall not be 
treated as using a normalization method of 
accounting for purposes of subsections (f)(2) 
and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986. 
(5) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary of the 
Treasury, or the Secretary’s designee, shall 
issue such regulations or other guidance as 
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out 
this subsection, including regulations or 
other guidance to provide appropriate co-
ordination between this subsection, section 
13001(d) of Public Law 115-97, and section 
203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, pa-
thetically, the United States has the 
highest child poverty rate of almost 
any major country on Earth, and it is 
especially high among young people of 
color. This is the wealthiest Nation on 
Earth; we should not have the highest 
rate of childhood poverty of almost any 
country. 
The American Rescue Plan included 
a $300-a-month child tax credit, which 
ended up lowering the child poverty 
rate in America by over 40 percent— 
over 40 percent reduction in childhood 
poverty, which, in my view, was an ex-
traordinary 
achievement. 
Unfortu-
nately for the millions of working par-
ents who benefited from this program, 
it expired in December. 
This amendment would restore the 
expanded child tax credit for 4 years 
and give millions of working families 
the opportunity to raise their children 
in dignity and security, and it would be 
fully paid for by restoring the top cor-
porate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 
percent. 
Let us reduce child poverty in Amer-
ica. Let us demand that the largest 
corporations start paying their fair 
share of taxes. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Sen-
ator SANDERS is right. The child tax 
credit is one of the most important 
things this body did. It brought down 
the child poverty rate by 40 percent al-
most immediately. We passed it in 
March. The Secretary of the Treasury 
had it up and running by July. It made 
a huge difference in people’s lives. 
I appreciate especially the work that 
Senator 
BENNET
and 
also 
Senator 
BOOKER
and Senator WARNOCK
have 
done on this. But I ask my colleagues 
to vote no because this will bring the 
bill down—a very good bill. We will 
continue to work hard on this every 
step of the way. 
I yield to Senator BENNET. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, last 
year, we demonstrated to the American 
people that we don’t have to accept 
this outrageous, shameful level of 
childhood poverty in our Nation. 
We have 38 out of 41 industrialized 
countries in the world in terms of 
childhood poverty. The poorest people 
in our country are our children. And 
because we passed this bill last year, 
we demonstrated that doesn’t have to 
be a permanent feature of our economy 
or our democracy. 
We have to fight to make this en-
hanced child tax credit permanent, and 
that is what I will do with people on 
both sides of the aisle. But this does 
not advance that cause because we

Mr. SANDERS. If I could ask my 
friend from Ohio, why would passage of 
this amendment or getting 48 votes on 
this amendment bring the overall bill 
down? 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Sen-
ator SANDERS, the arrangement on this 
is that all 50 Democrats are for this. 
We know every single Republican has 
voted against the child tax credit—not 
once last March but twice. We know 
that this is a fragile arrangement, and 
we have to pass it. As much as I like—

AMENDMENT NO. 5263 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I call 
up my amendment No. 5263 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 5263 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike the $80,000,000,000 slush 
fund for the Internal Revenue Service to 
prevent the hiring of 87,000 new Internal 
Revenue Service employees that will sur-
veil and audit the private account informa-
tion and transaction data of innocent 
Americans and small businesses) 
Strike part 3 of subtitle A of title I. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, there 
are a lot of bad things in this bill, but 
few are worse than the proposal by 
Democrats in this bill to double the 
size of the IRS and create 87,000 new 
IRS agents. I guarantee you citizens in 
every one of our States, if you ask 
them what do they want, they don’t 
want 87,000 new IRS agents. 
And they are not being created to 
audit billionaires or giant corpora-
tions; they are being created to audit 
you. The House Ways and Means Com-
mittee, the minority has put out an es-
timate that, under this bill, there will 
be 1.2 million new audits per year, with 
over 700,000 of those new audits falling 
on taxpayers making $75,000 or less. 
I believe, personally, we should abol-
ish the IRS, but, at a minimum, we 
shouldn’t make the IRS larger than the 
Pentagon, the State Department, the 
FBI, and the Border Patrol all com-
bined. That is what the Democrats are 
proposing here. It is a terrible idea. 
If you don’t want 87,000 new IRS 
agents, vote yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, what 
Americans don’t want is wealthy tax 
cheats to be able to rest easy because 
Republican budget cuts to the IRS 
mean that they can get away with 
breaking the law scot-free. 
And I want everybody in this body to 
understand that, on our watch at the 
Finance 
Committee, 
we 
are 
watchdogging this Agency every single 
day because there is no evidence of 
what the Senator from Texas has said 
is going on with respect to the privacy 
of innocent Americans, and on our 
watch it is never going to. 
I urge opposition.

AMENDMENT NO. 5262 
(Purpose: To make health care cov-
erage available to low-income adults in 
States that have not expanded Med-
icaid.) 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
call up amendment No. 5262, and I ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant executive clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Georgia [Mr. WARNOCK], 
for himself and others, proposes an amend-
ment numbered 5262 to amendment No. 5194. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
rise on behalf of nearly 41⁄2 million 
Americans 
in 
12 
States, 
including 
646,000 Georgians who, a decade after 
the Affordable Care Act became law, 
still do not have access to affordable 
healthcare. They are the working poor. 
They are being blocked by Governors 
and legislatures. 
But, sadly, today they are being be-
trayed by this body. The bill we are 
about to pass will rightly strengthen 
healthcare access for millions of Amer-
icans, but how do we justify doing that 
while leaving the hard-working fami-
lies in Georgia who gave us this power 
in the first place and the other 11 non-
expansion States in the cold? My 
amendment would simply extend the 
same subsidies to them. 
If in this bill we can extend tax relief 
to hedge fund managers, then, surely, 
we can extend tax credits as a lifeline 
to the working poor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4191 
August 6, 2022 
This is a moral moment. The scrip-
ture says: Woe to those who crush the 
poor. 
I am asking my Democratic col-
leagues to do the right thing and close 
this gap. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the 
Senator from Georgia is absolutely 
right in his description of this moral 
abomination where the citizens he rep-
resents have no healthcare decency. 
And he is right that it stems from the 
decisions of Republican Governors. He 
is talking about individuals with too 
much to qualify for Medicaid and not 
enough to get ACA subsidies. 
Tragically—and I have talked with 
my colleague about this—to preserve 
the rest of this bill’s health, climate, 
and tax policy, it is just not possible— 
as much as I want it—to get this fixed 
today. 
I will just close by saying to my col-
league that I will work with him every 
day, day in and day out, until his citi-
zens get the healthcare decency he so 
correctly calls for this morning. 
Reluctantly, I oppose the amend-
ment. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I don’t want to get in 
the middle off you all’s fight over here, 
but am I supposed to read this or not? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. GRAHAM. The pending amend-
ment No. 5262 offered by Senator 
WARNOCK contains matters outside the 
jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. 
Therefore, the amendment is extra-
neous, and I raise a point of order 
against this amendment pursuant to 
Section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, 
pursuant to Section 904 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 and waiver 
provisions of applicable budget resolu-
tions, I move to waive all applicable 
sections of that Act and applicable 
budget resolutions for purposes of the 
pending amendment, and I ask for the 
yeas and the nays.

The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant executive clerk

The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 5265 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To provide for certain conditions 
on the export to China of crude oil from 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) 
At the end of part 6 of subtitle B of title V, 
add the following: 
SEC. 
5026ll. 
CONDITION 
ON 
AUCTION 
OF 
CRUDE OIL FROM THE STRATEGIC 
PETROLEUM RESERVE. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) BIDDER.—The term ‘‘bidder’’ means an 
individual or entity bidding or intending to 
bid at an auction of crude oil from the Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve. 
(2) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of Energy. 
(3) STRATEGIC
PETROLEUM
RESERVE.—The

the Strategic Petroleum Reserve established 
under part B of title I of the Energy Policy 
and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231 et seq.). 
(b) BIDDING REQUIREMENTS ON EXPORT OF 
SPR CRUDE OIL TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding section 
161 of the Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 6241), and subject to paragraph 
(2), with respect to the drawdown and sale at 
auction of any crude oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary shall require, 
as a condition of any such sale, that in the 
case of a bid submitted by a bidder that in-
tends to export the crude oil to the People’s 
Republic of China, the bid will not be consid-
ered by the Secretary to be a valid bid unless 
the bidder has submitted a bid 10 times high-
er than the next highest bid received. 
(2) WAIVER.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—On application by a bid-

waiver under subparagraph (A) shall submit 
to the Secretary an application in such form 
and containing such information as the Sec-
retary may require. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, this 
bill represents the most significant as-
sault on U.S. energy production the 
Senate has ever considered. 
It is designed to bankrupt every coal 
miner in America, to dramatically in-
crease gas prices consumers are paying, 
and to permanently harm U.S. oil and 
gas production. 
There is, however, one group Senate 
Democrats do not oppose having more 
oil, and that is the Chinese com-
munists. 
In the past year, President Biden has 
sold over 2 million barrels of oil to the 
Chinese communist Government from 
America’s Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve. That oil was paid for by U.S. 
taxpayers. 
My bill would block the President 
from selling our oil to the Chinese 
communists. 
I would note also that it was sold to 
a Chinese company owned by the com-
munist government in which a signifi-
cant stake was owned by a private eq-
uity firm owned in significant part by 
the President’s own son, Hunter Biden. 
If the Democrats don’t want to see 
millions of barrels of U.S. oil sold to 
the Chinese communists, they should 
support my amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I 
raise a point of order that the pending 
amendment violates section 4106 of the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for 
fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71, of the 
115th Congress, the Senate pay-as-you- 
go point of order.

AMENDMENT NO. 5281 TO AMENDMENT NO. 5194 
(Purpose: To modify the bill.) 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call 
up my amendment No. 5281 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Vermont [Mr. SANDERS], 
for himself and Mr. MERKLEY, proposes an 
amendment numbered 5281 to amendment 
No. 5194. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
quote from a July 29 letter from over 
350 environmental organizations, in-
cluding Friends of the Earth, Food and 
Water Watch, and the Climate Justice 
Alliance, sent to President Biden and 
Senator SCHUMER, expressing concerns 
about this bill. 
Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or 
fast-tracking of fossil fuel permitting is in-
compatible with climate leadership. Oil, gas, 
and coal production are the core drivers of 
the climate and extinction crisis. There can 
be no new fossil fuel leases, exports or infra-
structure if we have any hope of preventing 
ever-worsening climate crises, catastrophic 
floods, deadly wildfires, and more—all of 
which are ripping across the country as we 
speak. Therefore, we’re calling on you to ful-
fill your promise to lead on climate, starting 
with denying approvals for the Mountain 
Valley Pipeline, rejecting all new federal fos-
sil fuel leases onshore, in the Gulf of Mexico, 
in Alaska and everywhere else, and pre-
venting any fast-tracked permits for fossil 
fuel projects. 
This was from 350 environmental or-
ganizations, and I agree with those or-
ganizations. 
My amendment would eliminate all 
of the provisions in this bill that would 
benefit the fossil fuel industry, includ-
ing opening up to 700 million acres of 
public lands and waters for oil and gas 
drilling. 
There is a reason why BP and Shell— 
some of the largest oil companies in 
this country—are supporting this bill, 
and it is not for a good reason. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in the 
night or day—or whatever we have 
been doing as the night has turned into 
day—of extremes, this is the most ex-
treme idea yet, and that is saying a 
lot. 
Senator SANDERS wants to destroy 
fossil fuel exploration at a time you 
have got to get a mortgage on your 
house to fill up your car. So I want you 
to understand what is being proposed: 
Shutting down American fossil fuel ex-
ploration will make us more dependent 
on fossil fuels that are in the hands of 
the bad guys. Gas is $4.08 a gallon right

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call

The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KENNEDY]

retary’’), out of any monies in the Treasury 
not otherwise appropriated, $3,100,000,000 for 
fiscal year 2023, to remain available through 
September 30, 2026, for making payments to

(A) the number of units of insulin fur-
nished to qualifying center patients in the 
previous quarter; and 
(B) the direct costs of procuring and mak-
ing available each such unit of insulin at the 
discounted rate provided for under this sec-
tion.

ters in making insulin and injectable epi-
nephrine available to qualifying center pa-
tients under subsection (b). 
(e) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) FEDERALLY-QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER.— 
The term ‘‘Federally-qualified health cen-
ter’’ has the meaning given such term in sec-
tion 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1396d(l)(2)(B)). 
(2) QUALIFYING CENTER PATIENT.—The term 
‘‘qualifying center patient’’ means a patient 
of a Federally-qualified health center whose 
household income is equal to or less than 350 
percent of the Federal poverty line and 
who— 
(A) has a cost-sharing requirement under a 
health 
insurance 
plan 
for 
insulin 
or 
injectable epinephrine under which the pa-
tient out-of-pocket share is more than 20 
percent of the total amount charged by the 
center for insulin or epinephrine; 
(B) has a high unmet deductible under a 
health insurance plan; or 
(C) has no health insurance. 
(f) PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND 
OFFSET.—Section 4002(b) of the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 
300u–11) is amended— 
(1) in paragraph (6), by striking ‘‘each of 
fiscal years 2022 and 2023’’ and inserting ‘‘fis-
cal year 2022’’; 
(2) by striking paragraphs (7) and (8); 
(3) by redesignating paragraph (9) as para-
graph (8); and 
(4) by inserting after paragraph (6) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(7) for fiscal year 2027, $1,800,000,000; and’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my 
amendment, which I also offer on be-
half of many of my Republican col-
leagues, would substantially and dra-
matically lower the cost of insulin for 
millions of Americans. 
As you know, we have 1,403 federally 
qualified healthcare centers in Amer-
ica, 
sometimes 
called 
community 
health centers. They have 16,000 sites 
of service. 
My amendment would reimplement a 
rule that President Biden repealed. My 
amendment would make insulin avail-
able at federally qualified health cen-
ters for pennies on the dollar, and it 
would pay for itself by redirecting ex-
isting money from the ObamaCare Pub-
lic Health and Prevention Fund. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, life-
saving medicines don’t do any good if 
people can’t afford them. That is why 
it is so important that we do help peo-
ple get the medicine they need, espe-
cially insulin. It is exactly why we 
need to pass the Inflation Reduction 
Act, which does take historic steps to 
lower costs, and it caps patients’ insu-
lin costs at $35 a month. 
If Republicans really want to help pa-
tients get insulin, they will help us get 
this bill signed into law instead of try-
ing to derail it with amendments and 
trying to weaken the insulin provision 
Democrats want to pass. 
We are fighting to make sure that no 
one has to ration their insulin and put 
their life at risk. I hope some Repub-
licans will join us in working to make 
this lifesaving medicine affordable and 
pass this bill—hopefully soon—here 
today. But I do urge my colleagues to 
reject this amendment so we can get to 
that point.

The amendment (No. 5385) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
consent to speak for 1 minute prior to 
the Senator from South Carolina mov-
ing to waive the Budget Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 37 mil-
lion people in our country have diabe-
tes. And it is absolutely wrong that 
many of them cannot afford the insulin 
they need to live. I have heard from 
people in my State who risk their life 
and ration their insulin to make ends 
meet. All the while, drug companies 
are jacking up prices. 
The cost of insulin has tripled over 
the last decade, and it is not like it is 
three times better. The reality is, the 
cost of insulin isn’t just out of control; 
it is devastating people and not just 
seniors but workers and students and 
parents who are just trying to get insu-
lin for their kids. 
We have an opportunity here to make 
a difference and permanently cap insu-
lin at $35 a month. It will save money. 
It will save lives. This should not be a 
hard vote to cast. A budget waiver will 
continue allowing people to get insulin 
at $35 a month. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle not to remove this provision 
from the underlying bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I be-
lieve this violates the rules of rec-
onciliation. I make a point of order 
against page 744, line 7, through page 
755, line 4, in the substitute. This lan-
guage violates 313(b)(1)(D) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to section 904 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver pro-
visions of applicable budget resolu-
tions, I move to waive all applicable 
sections of that act and applicable 
budget resolutions for purposes of the 
pending amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). On this vote, the yeas are 57, 
the nays are 43. 
Three-fifths of the Senate duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is not agreed 
to. 
The point of order is sustained, and 
the language will be stricken from the 
amendment. 
The Senator from Texas. 
MOTION TO COMMIT 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] moves 
to commit the bill H.R. 5376 to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs of the Senate with instruc-
tions to report the same back to the Senate 
in 3 days, not counting any day in which the 
Senate is not in session, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee, and (2) in order to guarantee that no 
student is prohibited from attending school, 
or accrues more pandemic induced learning 
loss, ensure no funding be made available to 
enforce a COVID–19 vaccine mandate on any 
student eligible to attend a District of Co-
lumbia public or charter school for the 2022– 
2023 school year. 
The motion to commit is as follows: 
Mr. CRUZ moves to commit the bill H.R. 
5376 to the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs of the Senate with 
instructions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day in 
which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) in order to guarantee that no student is 
prohibited from attending school, or accrues 
more pandemic induced learning loss, ensure 
no funding be made available to enforce a 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate on any student 
eligible to attend a District of Columbia pub-
lic or charter school for the 2022–2023 school 
year. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, with the 
support of every Senate Democrat in 
this Chamber, schools across this coun-
try shut down over the past 2 years. 
Tens of millions of children were 
harmed. 
Today, Senate Democrats will have a 
choice whether or not they will harm 
thousands of schoolkids in Washington, 
DC, and, in particular, whether they 
will harm African-American children 
in Washington, DC. 
In DC, the rate of vaccination for 
students 12 to 15 is 85 percent. For Afri-
can-American students, the rate drops 
to 60 percent. The DC public schools 
have announced that any student who 
is not vaccinated is not allowed to 
come to school. 
If Democrats vote no on this motion 
to commit, they will be voting to tell 
thousands of African-American stu-
dents in DC: You are not allowed to 
come to school. Your education doesn’t 
matter. 
The right choice, to use a mantra 
used by Democrats often, is ‘‘your 
body, your choice,’’ and we should not 
be denying children education because 
DC Democrats want to force them to 
get a COVID vaccine against their 
wishes or their parents’ wishes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this mo-
tion is just another effort to delay or 
kill this incredibly important bill and 
would effectively remove the require-
ment for students to be vaccinated 
against COVID–19 in DC public schools. 
Vaccines have proven to be effective 
at preventing the spread of this harm-
ful disease, and DC public schools now 
require FDA-approved COVID–19 vac-
cines for eligible students, just like 
they do for measles and hepatitis A and 
hepatitis B. 
The requirement for DC public school 
students to be vaccinated against this 
virus was enacted by the District of Co-
lumbia’s City Council, a body that was 
duly elected by 700,000 Americans liv-
ing in our Nation’s Capital. This mo-
tion would unnecessarily meddle with 
local, Washington, DC, government and 
delay or kill this vital bill we are here 
to pass today. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
measure.

ents or classify them as domestic terrorists 
based on their engagement with public 
school officials as it relates to their child’s 
education unless such engagement with offi-

gagement with officials is already otherwise 
illegal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, one of the 
worst aspects of the Biden administra-
tion has been the deep politicization of 
the Department of Justice and the FBI. 
We saw that with the National Asso-
ciation of School Boards sending a let-
ter to the White House and to the At-
torney General asking that the Biden 
administration target parents as do-
mestic terrorists and use the PATRIOT 
Act to go after them for going to 
school boards and complaining about 
policies that are unfair to parents, in-
cluding the teaching of critical race 
theory, 
including 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Loudoun County, a 14-year-old girl who 
was sexually assaulted in a bathroom, 
and the school covered it up. 
Within 4 days of receiving that let-
ter, the Attorney General wrote a 
memo directing the FBI to target par-
ents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4195 
August 6, 2022 
Just this last week, the Director of 
the FBI testified at the Judiciary Com-
mittee that they had been interviewing 
multiple parents—moms and dads—and 
the House has categorized it as upward 
of 20 moms and dads. 
This amendment says: Don’t target 
parents as domestic terrorists— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is expired. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the FBI 
has told us repeatedly that domestic 
extremism is a very real threat in 
America. Last November, 60 percent of 
America’s school leaders said that 
someone in their schools had been ver-
bally or physically threatened over 
school policy. 
There is no evidence—none—that the 
Department of Justice is threatening 
the constitutional right of parents to 
peaceful, free speech. But there is no 
excuse—none—for 
violence 
against 
school teachers or board members. 
If you believe there is nothing peace-
ful or legitimate about threatening 
teachers, school board members or 
their families, vote no on this amend-
ment.

The motion was rejected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BEN-

MOTION TO COMMIT 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. 
HOEVEN] moves to commit the bill to the 
Committee on Finance with instructions to 
report. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the reading of the names be 
waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The motion to commit is as follows: 
Mr. HOEVEN moves to commit the bill H.R. 
5376 to the Committee on Finance of the Sen-
ate with instructions to report the same 
back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting 
any day in which the Senate is not in ses-
sion, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would prohibit the implementation of 
the provisions of the bill H.R. 5376 until the 
date on which— 
(A) grocery prices (as reported by the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics as annual CPI–U for 
‘‘food at home’’) decrease below the food at 
home annual inflation level (as reported by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics for January 
2021); 
(B) gasoline prices (as reported by the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics as annual CPI–U for 
‘‘gasoline (all types)’’) decrease below the 
gasoline (all types) annual inflation level (as 
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
for January 2021); 
(C) diesel prices (as reported by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics as annual CPI–U for 
‘‘other motor fuels’’) decrease below the 
other motor fuels annual inflation level (as 
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
for January 2021); 
(D) home heating oil prices (as reported by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics as annual 
CPI–U for ‘‘fuel oil’’) decrease below the fuel 
oil annual inflation level (as reported by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics for January 2021); 
and 
(E) housing expenses (as reported by the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics as annual CPI–U 
for ‘‘shelter’’) decrease below the shelter an-
nual inflation level (as reported by the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics for January 2021). 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, the 
American people are hurting. Inflation 
has soared to the highest we have seen 
in 40 years, and the Consumer Price 
Index is now 9.1 percent. Americans are 
seeing increased prices on everything 
from the grocery store to the gas 
pump. Gas prices have gone up $2.25 a 
gallon just since the President took of-
fice. Diesel prices since this adminis-
tration took office are up $2.81—that 
means 60 percent more since President 
Biden took office. The cost of food is up 
more than 12 percent. 
We not only have inflation, we have 
our economy stagnating as well—stag-
flation. It is something we haven’t had 
since the late 1970s, early 1980s. We 
have the resources and the capabilities 
to reduce that inflation to address the 
stagnation. This tax-and-spend bill is 
not the way to do it. 
I ask that we return this to com-
mittee and come up with a plan that 
will actually get our economy going 
and reduce inflation. I ask for support 
on this motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to this amendment. 
This, again, is about delay, about 
postponing, about putting off the job 
that needs to be done. What the focus 
of this bill is all about is cutting costs. 
What I have said to colleagues—and 
my friend, the Presiding Officer of the 
Senate, knows this—is that our bill on 
prescription drugs kicks in this fall. 
We really kick in on the efforts to hold 
down price gouging when medicine is 
going up faster than the rate of infla-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this. 
We can’t afford any further delay in 
priorities like saving senior citizens 
from their medicine costs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, the bill 
increases taxes and increases spending. 
It will not bring down costs, and it will 
not bring down inflation. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO COMMIT 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4196 
August 6, 2022 
The Senate Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. 
Black, offered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O Lord our God, who rules the raging 
of the sea, our weekend work gently re-
minds us that freedom’s price must be 
paid. As our Senators provide the cur-
rency of perseverance to protect and 
defend this land we love, strengthen 
them for the challenges and empower 
them for the vicissitudes. Remind 
them, as they strive to pay liberty’s re-
curring bill, that You will never leave 
or forsake them. 
Rouse Yourself, O Lord, and help 
them. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
MOTION TO COMMIT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have a motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Tennessee [Mrs. BLACK-
BURN] moves to commit the bill to the Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and For-
estry with instructions to report. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask that we waive the reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The motion is as follows: 
Mrs. BLACKBURN moves to commit the bill 
H.R. 5376 to the Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate with 
instructions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day in 
which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would ensure that no funding made 
available by the bill for the environmental 
quality incentives program, the conservation 
stewardship program, the agricultural con-
servation easement program, or the regional 
conservation partnership program may be 
provided to— 
(A) an agricultural producer located in the 
United States who is a nonresident alien, 
foreign business, agent, trustee, or fiduciary 
associated with the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; or 
(B) an entity partially or wholly owned hy 
such an agricultural producer. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
right now, Chinese owners control 
more than 194,000 acres of farm and for-
estry land valued at $1.9 billion, as of 
the last accounting, right here in the 
United States. Now, much of this farm-
land is located in close proximity to 
our military institutions, and a lot of 
this farmland is being used so that Chi-
nese-owned farm operations can com-
pete with U.S. farmers. 
My amendment would stop funds 
from this bill from ending up in the 
hands of agents of the Chinese Govern-
ment and their businesses. This is a 
commonsense motion to commit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this 
motion to commit is a red herring and 
a complete distraction. 
The Department of Agriculture al-
ready has strict rules that all pro-
ducers must meet before they can par-
ticipate in USDA conservation pro-
grams. 
These dollars go to farmers who are 
American citizens or legal permanent 
residents for conservation practices 
that help protect and improve Amer-
ican soil and water. Farmers are only 
reimbursed after the practices are in 
place. 
This would add burdensome paper-
work, unnecessary bureaucracy that 
would really bog our farmers down. 
This is different than circumstances 
that were just talked about with state- 
owned Chinese companies. This is not 
the same thing. This amendment goes 
right at our farmers and the conserva-
tion practices they are asking us to 
support for them. 
Again, the only reason for this 
amendment is to stop us from passing 
this bill, which, among other things, 
will cut prescription drug costs, create 
jobs, and tackle the climate crisis. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.

MOTION TO COMMIT 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. RUBIO] has 
a motion to commit to bill H.R. 5376 to the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions of the Senate with instructions to 
report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, 
not counting any day in which the Senate is 
not in session, with changes that—(1), are 
within the jurisdiction of such committee; 
and, (2) would contain a definition for the 
term ‘‘pregnancy’’ that limits maternal and 
infant-related program resources to biologi-
cal females. 
The motion is as follows: 
Mr. RUBIO moves to commit the bill H.R. 
5376 to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions of the Senate with in-
structions to report the same back to the 
Senate in 3 days, not counting any day in 
which the Senate is not in session, with 
changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would contain a definition for the term 
‘‘pregnancy’’ that limits maternal and in-
fant-related program resources to biological 
females. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, the only 
people who are capable of being preg-
nant are biological females; and, there-
fore, I think Federal pregnancy pro-
grams should be limited to biological 
females and that is what this would do. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let’s 
be clear about what is going on here. 
This is a procedural attempt by Repub-
licans to derail our ability to get this 
bill across the finish line and deliver 
for families in our country. 
It is actually outrageous that Repub-
licans are trying to talk about preg-
nancy when in this country, right now, 
they are forcing women to stay preg-
nant no matter their circumstances, 
pushing cruel and extreme abortion 
bans. 
Republicans are now resorting to tac-
tics like this to distract from the fact 
that they don’t have any serious rea-
sons for working so hard to oppose this 
bill that lowers costs, lowers emis-
sions, and lowers the deficit. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida has 40 seconds. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, a few min-
utes ago, I looked back across 5,500 
years of human history. So far, every 
single pregnancy has been a biological 
female. Therefore, the only thing I am 
trying to do is make sure that the Fed-
eral law is clear that since every preg-
nancy that has ever existed has been in 
a biological female, that our Federal 
laws reflect that and pregnancy pro-
grams are available to the only people 
who are capable of getting pregnant— 
biological females. Very simple. 
I would accept a unanimous consent 
if they want to offer it, and we can 
move on and not waste any time.

POINTS OF ORDER EN BLOC 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
consent to make the following four 
points of order en bloc. 
The first point of order concerns page 
43, lines 3 through 8. This language vio-
lates section 313(b)(1)(A). 
The second point concerns page 1, 
lines 3 through 5. This language vio-
lates 313(b)(1)(A). 
The third point concerns page 547, 
line 18, through page 548, line 25. This 
language violates section 313(b)(1)(A). 
And the fourth point of order con-
cerns page 689, lines 8 through 16. This 
language violates section 313(b)(1)(D). 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
points of order are sustained; the provi-
sions are stricken under 313(b), 313(e). 
The Senator from Alaska. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5435 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I call 
up my amendment No. 5435, and I ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant executive clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Alaska [Mr. SULLIVAN] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5435 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
that the reading be waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To replace the funding for the Of-
fice of the Chief Readiness Support Officer 
with a $500,000,000 appropriation for the 
construction or improvement of primary 
pedestrian fencing and barriers along the 
southwest border) 
In title VII, strike section 70001 and insert 
the following: 
SEC. 70001. FUNDING FOR U.S. CUSTOMS AND 
BORDER PROTECTION. 
In addition to amounts otherwise avail-
able, there is appropriated to U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection for fiscal year 2022, 
out of any money in the Treasury not other-
wise appropriated, $500,000,000, which shall 
remain available until September 30, 2027, for 
necessary expenses relating to the construc-
tion or improvement of primary pedestrian 
fencing and barriers along the southwest 
border. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we 
have a true crisis—a humanitarian cri-
sis, a national security crisis—right 
now on our southern border. 
It is a huge tragedy that my Demo-
cratic colleagues want to ignore, and 
that tragedy has spread across our Na-
tion—crime; victims of human traf-
ficking, many of them children; a 
fentanyl epidemic killing our young 
people; chaos—all fueled by a lawless 
border. 
Secure borders work. Walls work. 
Just ask the Biden administration, as 
they are quietly building sections of 
the wall in Arizona right now. 
The Democrats’ partisan reconcili-
ation bill does nothing—nothing—to 
address this crisis. 
Instead, it gives DHS $500 million for 
sustainability and environmental pro-
grams when our kids are dying from 
drugs streaming in from the border, 
when our communities are under siege. 
This should not be the priority for 
DHS. 
My amendment would take this half 
a billion dollars and recommit it—this 
DHS money—to building the wall and 
securing our border, which is DHS’s 
primary mission, not environmental 
programs. 
I ask that all my colleagues vote yes 
on this commonsense amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, commu-
nities all across the country are suf-
fering from exposure to PFAS—com-
monly used chemicals that do not 
break down and have been linked to se-
rious health problems. 
This amendment would strike a pro-
vision in the bill that would help DHS 
repair and upgrade its facilities to pro-
tect 
surrounding 
communities 
and 
frontline DHS personnel from these 
harmful chemicals. 
This amendment, instead, seeks to 
continue the past administration’s ef-
forts to fund and construct an ill-con-
ceived border wall on the southern bor-
der. 
I agree that we need secure borders, 
but we need smart and cost-effective 
security 
measures, 
including 
tech-
nology and adequate personnel levels 
to meet our border security needs. 
We should be working together in a 
bipartisan manner to develop smart in-
vestments in border security. 
Let’s secure our southern and north-
ern borders instead of throwing tax-
payer dollars to build a costly and inef-
fective wall. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, how 
much time do I have left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is 
expired on both sides. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5435 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 6, 2022 
AMENDMENT NO. 5487 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
amendments 
be 
considered 
as 
one 
amendment, No. 5487: No. 5425, Mr. 
DAINES; No. 5361, Ms. ERNST; No. 5360, 
Mrs. FISCHER; No. 5224, Mr. PORTMAN; 
No. 5411, Mr. BARRASSO; and No. 5454, 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I further ask that 
there be 2 minutes of debate, equally 
divided, on each division prior to the 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Montana [Mr. DAINES], 
for Mr. GRAHAM
and others, proposes an 
amendment numbered 5487. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, my 
amendment would strike the anti-en-
ergy provisions that snuck into this 
bill behind closed doors. 
This partisan bill before us has a slew 
of provisions that raises royalty rates, 
fees, rents, and taxes that hurt our 
small oil and gas producers in America 
the most. By the way, it is those small 
oil and gas producers that produce over 
80 percent of our supply. I guarantee 
you, if there is a rebuttal, they will 
talk about Big Oil, but this is not Big 
Oil; 80 percent is from the small guys. 
These producers don’t have the ability 
to absorb the large increases from the 
government, so if you raise prices for 
energy producers, you raise energy 
prices for Americans. 
It is not that complicated. If you 
want lower gas prices, vote yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, this one 
should be simple. 
My amendment eliminates subsidies 
for slave and child labor. The price of 
buying a car has reached a record high, 
and what is the Democrats’ answer? A 
tax break for wealthy coastal elites to 
buy electric vehicles produced with 
slave and child labor. 
Currently, this bill already prevents 
vehicles containing any part sourced or 
assembled in foreign entities of con-
cern, like China or Russia, from being 
eligible for the tax credit. My amend-
ment doesn’t change that. My amend-
ment simply ensures that our tax dol-
lars don’t subsidize EVs from any coun-
tries using child or slave labor. 
We all know the critical minerals 
that comprise EV batteries are largely 
mined in sub-Saharan Africa by compa-
nies abusing children, which are then 
assembled in Chinese-owned factories, 
many of which use slave labor. Sub-
sidizing, to the tune of $7,500 per per-
son, the purchase of a luxury vehicle 
for wealthy coastal elites that utilizes 
slave or child labor is a direct con-
tradiction of our American values. 
We shouldn’t be sacrificing a clean 
conscience in exchange for a so-called 
cleaner car. 
I urge the adoption of the amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, my 
Democratic colleagues say wealthy 
Americans should pay their fair share. 
Yet they want to expand the electric 
vehicle tax credit for the rich once 
again. 
In this bill, there are two separate 
EV tax credits: one for people who 
want to buy new $80,000 vehicles and 
one for those who want to buy used 
EVs. 
Why two separate credits? The tax 
credit for new EVs is available to the 
wealthy, while the credit for the new 
EVs is limited to the folks with lower 
incomes. Why do my colleagues from 
the other side keep giving bigger tax 
breaks to their rich donors? 
My change would at least prevent 
taxpayer dollars from subsidizing the 
wealthy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is 
a really easy one. Let’s trade bureauc-
racy and more funding in this bill for 
bureaucracy at the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
for 
desperately 
needed technology along the southern 
border to stop deadly fentanyl from 
coming into our communities. 
Tragically, over 100,000 Americans 
were killed last year, which is a record, 
from drug overdoses. Two-thirds of 
those overdoses were from these syn-
thetic opioids, like fentanyl. 
We know that the vast majority of 
that fentanyl originates with drug car-
tels in Mexico now, and there is a surge 
of these deadly drugs coming across 
our southern border. 
This amendment increases funding 
for Customs and Border Protection by 
$500 million for badly needed tech-
nology to detect fentanyl and other 
drugs. If you can believe it, right now, 
only 2 percent of cars—2 percent—and 
14, 15, 16 percent, maybe, of commercial 
vehicles are being screened. Both GAO 
and the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity IG have done reports saying we 
badly need this technology, and it is 
available. We need the funding. 
The funding is more than offset by 
reducing huge funding increases in this 
bill for this Office of Chief Readiness at 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
So this money stays at DHS. 
Let’s make it a higher priority to 
stop and detect these deadly poisons 
coming into our communities. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this 
is an amendment from Senator BAR-
RASSO
and me. It is very straight-
forward. 
If you are a restaurant, you can de-
duct your business expenses. That is 
normal tax code. If you are a hardware 
store, you can deduct your business ex-
penses. That is normal operation. 
Since 1913, intangible drilling costs 
have been the tax deductions for oil 
and gas. IDCs, or intangible drilling 
costs, since 1913, have been set aside for 
preparing the space, doing all the labor 
costs, the services, the normal business 
operations, for 100 years, until now. 
Slipped into this bill yesterday, into 
the base tax, strips away the tax de-
ductions for oil and gas companies, 
what has been in place for over 100 
years. If you are a wind farm, you can 
use renewable energy credits to take 
your tax rate down to zero because you 
can deduct your normal business ex-
penses as well. If you are a coal com-
pany, you can use 45Q, but if you are 
oil and gas, your prices are going up. 
Americans should remember this bill 
when they fill up in the days ahead and 
when the people in their communities 
are trying to get a job with oil and gas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the 
United States’ mineral security has 
really become our Achilles’ heel. It is a 
significant threat to our economy, to 
our competitiveness, to our security, 
and to our geopolitical leverage, all at 
the same time. 
We know that mineral demand is 
skyrocketing, and yet it is harder than 
ever to produce minerals here in this 
country. So what we have done is that 
we have turned to imports to fill the 
gaps in our supply. 
We are seeking, through this amend-
ment, to put some limited assistance 
on the table to make sure that projects 
for the most critical minerals can 
move forward in a timely manner. That 
is what my amendment does for cobalt 
and for nickel. 
Right now, we import 76 percent of 
our cobalt, 48 percent of our nickel, but 
demand is growing so dramatically for 
both as a result of EVs, of energy stor-
age systems, and other clean tech-
nologies. So what we are seeking to do 
with this is repurpose $400 million for 
States to implement energy efficiency 
codes to instead ensure that domestic 
nickel and cobalt projects can advance. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
yields time in opposition? 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, these 
are all problematic amendments that 
would jeopardize the underlying legis-
lation and the progress on climate, on 
prescription drugs, and on a whole host 
of other things. So we should all vote 
no. We should pass this important bill, 
and we should be done with this.

The amendment (No. 5487) was re-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
MOTION TO COMMIT 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Tennessee 
[Mr. 
HAGERTY] moves to commit the bill to the 
Committee on the Judiciary with instruc-
tions to report. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I ask 
to dispense with the reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The motion is as follows: 
Mr. HAGERTY moves to commit the bill 
H.R. 5376 to the Committee on the Judiciary 
of the Senate with instructions to report the 
same back to the Senate in 3 days, not 
counting any day in which the Senate is not 
in session, with changes that— 
(1) are within the jurisdiction of such com-
mittee; and 
(2) would ensure that U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement has sufficient re-
sources to detain and deport a higher num-
ber of illegal aliens who have been convicted 
of a criminal offense in the United States. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, in fis-
cal year 2021, Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement arrested more than 
12,000 illegal aliens with aggravated 
felony convictions. An alltime record 
number of illegal border crossers en-
tered our country last year. This is an 
unprecedented national security crisis. 
Before we spend billions of dollars on 
Green New Deal programs, the Depart-
ment should first do its core job of se-
curing the homeland. 
This same policy was adopted 53 to 46 
during the budget resolution process 
last August, with four of my Demo-
cratic colleagues joining me. Now, 1 
year later, we have a worse crisis and 
an opportunity to provide real funding 
to protect our citizens from individuals 
who endanger our communities. 
I hope my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will maintain their 
previous support for this commonsense 
approach to fund law enforcement and 
put public safety and national security 
over partisan politics. We have a 
chance to address this in a real manner 
right now. Solving a major crisis like 
this is worth taking a little more time. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Mem-
bers, the Senator from Tennessee just 
provided us with this copy of his new 
amendment, and I hope you will take a 
look at it because it is recommitting 
this motion for 3 days. End of con-
versation, end of debate, end of any 
possibility of passing what we consider 
to be a major piece of legislation, from 
prescription drugs, dealing with envi-
ronmental issues, and the list goes on. 
We have faced this so many times al-
ready in the last 12 or 14 hours. 
But the second thing I would like to 
note is, we understand the seriousness 
of this challenge, so much so that we 
have already decided it is a crime, and 
it is a crime that can be prosecuted. 
And it is a crime that is investigated 
and enforced by an Agency of the Fed-
eral Government which we funded just 
4 months ago. Four months ago, we 
gave $8 billion to ICE for this purpose. 
Thirty-one Republicans voted against 
funding this purpose. One of them was 
the Senator from Tennessee. 
So now we are told we need the 
money, but 4 months ago he wouldn’t 
vote for it. I think we know what we 
have here. We have a challenge that 
really is important to this motion that 
both parties share, but we have a polit-
ical challenge with an effort to derail 
this measure today. Stick together and 
vote against this amendment. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, do I 
have more time left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.

The question occurs on agreeing to 
the Hagerty motion to commit.

ond.

AMENDMENT NO. 5472 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 5472 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A Senator from South Dakota [Mr. THUNE] 
proposes an amendment numbered 5472 to 
amendment No. 5194. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To remove harmful small business 
taxes, and for other purposes) 
At the end of part 9 of subtitle D of title I, 
insert the following: 
SEC. 13904. REMOVAL OF HARMFUL SMALL BUSI-
NESS TAXES; EXTENSION OF LIMITA-
TION ON DEDUCTION FOR STATE 
AND LOCAL, ETC., TAXES. 
(a) REMOVAL OF HARMFUL SMALL BUSINESS 
TAXES.—Subparagraph (D) of section 59(k)(1), 
as added by section 10101, is amended to read 
as follows: 
‘‘(D) SPECIAL RULES FOR DETERMINING AP-
PLICABLE
CORPORATION
STATUS.—Solely for 
purposes of determining whether a corpora-
tion is an applicable corporation under this 
paragraph, all adjusted financial statement 
income of persons treated as a single em-
ployer with such corporation under sub-
section (a) or (b) of section 52 shall be treat-
ed as adjusted financial statement income of 
such corporation, and adjusted financial 
statement income of such corporation shall 
be determined without regard to paragraphs 
(2)(D)(i) and (11) of section 56A(c).’’. 
(b) EXTENSION OF LIMITATION ON DEDUCTION 
FOR STATE AND LOCAL, ETC., TAXES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 164(b)(6) is amend-
ed— 
(A) in the heading, by striking ‘‘2025’’ and 
inserting ‘‘2026’’, and 
(B) by striking ‘‘2026’’ and inserting ‘‘2027’’. 
(2) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendments 
made by this subsection shall apply to tax-
able years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Demo-
crats say that the book minimum tax 
will apply only to very large corpora-
tions with a 3-year average financial 
statement income in excess of $1 bil-
lion, but as their bill is currently pro-
posed—and this change occurred basi-
cally in the last 24 hours—the bill

would now require unrelated companies 
of any size held by funds or partner-
ships to combine their otherwise unre-
lated income to determine if they meet 
an aggregate $1 billion income thresh-
old, subjecting each respective com-
pany to the book minimum tax even if 
its own income is far too low. This sig-
nificant expansion of the tax has the 
potential 
to 
subject 
thousands 
of 
American businesses to the book min-
imum tax’s administrative and finan-
cial burdens. 
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation said this change would raise 
$35 billion in taxes on potentially thou-
sands of small- and medium-size busi-
nesses, not merely a hundred or so 
large companies as our Democratic 
friends would have you believe. 
My amendment is fully offset by ex-
tending for 1 year the cap on the State 
and local tax deduction enacted in the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this amendment and help ensure our 
Nation’s small- and medium-size busi-
nesses aren’t hit with a misguided and 
entirely inappropriate $35 billion tax 
hike. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there are 
no tax increases on small businesses in 
our bill. The only companies that are 
paying under our bill are corporations 
with at least $1 billion in profit per 
year. 
Republicans are calling private eq-
uity giants and foreign corporations 
with at least $1 billion in profits small 
businesses because they want private 
equity and foreign corporations to get 
more favorable treatment. Rather than 
close loopholes for billion-dollar pri-
vate equity firms, Republicans would 
raise taxes on those making less than 
$400,000 per year. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the end 
is near—I hope. For those of us on this 
side of the aisle who have worked long 
and hard, this is the last substantive 
action we have to take before final pas-
sage of a historic piece of legislation. 
Recognizing—and I want to thank 
the Senators on both sides of the aisle 
for the productive discussions in the 
last vote on a difficult issue that my 
amendment would address. 
My amendment would simply strike 
the offset in the previous amendment 
known as the State and local tax de-
duction and replace it with a 2-year ex-
tension of a so-called loss limitation 
policy that has bipartisan support over 
many years. 
This was first employed under Presi-
dent Trump, then employed by the 
Democrats. Everyone on this side of 
the aisle has voted for this pay-for, $52 
billion, which more than offsets the $35 
billion that were taken from the pre-
vious amendment. 
This amendment will allow us to 
move forward on this historic legisla-
tion, on drug prices, climate change,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4201 
August 6, 2022 
reform the tax code, and bring down in-
flation and make sure we have got a 
true comprehensive energy policy. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
the amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would 
urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment. The amendment we just 
voted on and passed has an offset in 
there, and it is a provision that works 
very, very well and covers getting rid 
of this tax on private equity on small 
businesses and larger businesses in this 
country. 
And what the Senator from Virginia 
is proposing is an offset loss limitation. 
And he is right, we have voted for it. 
We voted for it because we put it in the 
tax bill in 2017 as an offset, and what it 
offset and paid for was the 199A deduc-
tion that benefits all our passthrough 
businesses, small businesses, across 
this country, which expires in 2026. 
That very offset is how we are going 
to pay for extending the 199A deduction 
for passthrough businesses in this 
country. So if you want to rob it and 
use it here, it is not going to be avail-
able when it comes time to help out 
those small businesses, all of whom 
you represent, passthrough businesses 
across this country. The offset, the 
pay-for in my amendment is the right 
way to do this. 
I urge you to oppose the amendment. 
Mr. WARNER. Do I have any time re-
maining? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 5488 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
Mr. SCHATZ. I ask for the yeas and

There is a sufficient second.

The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 50, the nays are 50. 
The Senate being equally divided, the 
Vice President votes in the affirma-
tive, and the amendment is agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 5488) was agreed 
to. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
know of no further amendments to the 
substitute. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there are 
no further amendments, the question is 
on agreeing to the substitute, as 
amended. 
The amendment (No. 5194), as amend-
ed, was agreed to. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk 
will read the title of the bill for the 
third time. 
The amendments were ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it 
has been a long, tough, and winding 
road, but at last—at last—we have ar-
rived. 
I know it has been a long day and a 
long night, but we have gotten it done. 
Today, after more than a year of hard 
work, the Senate is making history. 
I am confident the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act will endure as one of the de-
fining legislative feats of the 21st cen-
tury. 
Our bill reduces inflation, lowers 
costs, creates millions of good-paying 
jobs, and is the boldest climate pack-
age in U.S. history. 
This bill will kick start the era of af-
fordable clean energy in America. It is 
a game changer. It is a turning point, 
and it has been a long time in coming. 
To Americans who have lost faith 
that Congress can do big things, this 
bill is for you. To seniors who face the 
indignity of rationing medications or 
skipping them altogether, this bill is 
for you. And to the tens of millions of 
young Americans who have spent years 
marching, rallying, demanding that 
Congress act on climate change, this 
bill is for you. 
The time has come to pass this his-
toric bill. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill hav-
ing been read the third time, the ques-
tion is, Shall the bill, as amended, 
pass? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 50, the nays are 50. The 
Senate being equally divided, the Vice 
President votes in the affirmative, and 
the bill, as amended, is passed. 
The bill (H.R. 5376), as amended, was 
passed. 
(Cheers and applause.) 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
have got to compose myself a little 
here. Every Senator knows an undeni-
able truth: We can never do what we do 
without our amazing, incredible staff. 
They work behind the scenes; they 
never fall under the spotlight. But they 
do incredible work, nonetheless. 
Now that we finished passing the In-
flation Reduction Act, I want to ap-
plaud all of the staffers—we already ap-
plauded them, but that is good—who 
made this possible. The hundreds of 
staffers who served in Senate offices 
across the various committees. I want 
to thank every single one of them for 
their remarkable work in passing the 
Inflation Reduction Act. 
I will submit their names into the 
RECORD to honor their achievements 
and preserve forever the role they 
played in bringing this bill to life. And 
I ask unanimous consent to have the 
names of all of the committee staff 
who contributed printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, to 
the floor staff, particularly the Parlia-
mentarian, who worked so hard under 
not easy conditions. And especially be-
cause we had to do so much in such a 
short period of time, we thank you so. 
The clerks, the doorkeepers, the re-
porters—thank you. 
Thank you to the pages who worked 
over time to help us in this historic en-
deavor. You will tell your grand-
children you were here. You were here. 
Thank you to the cafeteria workers, 
custodial staff, and Capitol Police. The 
Senate can’t function without all of 
you. And I thank the Office of Legisla-
tive Counsel, the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice. And, of course, I cannot forget my 
own staff—the best staff ever on Cap-
itol Hill—and my Members know it. 
The Members know how good my staff 
is. I am so dedicated to them, the best 
in the business. Of course, every Sen-
ator thinks their staff is the best on 
Capitol Hill; but in my case, it happens 
to be true. 
To Mike Lynch, who has been with 
me all these years and is so strong and 
steadfast and steady; to his deputy 
chief and my deputy chief Erin Sager 
Vaughn, another person who has been 
here a very long time and is just amaz-
ing. We praise her for her EQ, among 
other talents. She told me that. 
To Martin Brennan, another like 
Mike Lynch—Mike Lynch and Martin 
Brennan have been with me just about 
since I started to be a Senator, and 
they are just such rocks in our office— 
incredible. Probably the team of hus-
band and wife who have done more to 
save the Earth this year than just 
about anybody else is Gerry Petrella 
and Meghan Taira. They met and got 
married on my staff. They have a beau-
tiful little boy, George. And when you 
have two people so important as policy 
director and legislative director and a 
little child at home, it is tough. But 
they managed to be great parents at 
the same time as being great and amaz-
ing staffers. And they are brilliant. 
They are just brilliant. 
My executive team is world class: 
Emily Sweda, Kellie Karney, Abby 
Kaluza, and Raisa Shah—who just left 
a few weeks ago; an amazing press 
team, Justin Goodman, Alex Nguyen— 
nicknamed ‘‘Win,’’ of course—Monica 
Lee, Alice Nam, Ken Meyer, Cyre 
Velez, 
Jasmine 
Harris, 
Jonathan 
Uriarte, Natalia Cardenas, and every-
one on the digital team, the Senate 
Media Center who worked day and 
night, to record, edit, finalize photos, 
graphics and videos of every sort. They 
are a blessing. 
And I want to recognize my press 
staff up in New York. They are just in-
credible. Amazing. I am just so blessed: 
Angelo Roefaro, Ally Biasotti, Paige 
Tepke; my speechwriter, Tony Rivera; 
my 
rapid 
response 
director, 
Dan 
Yoken; the amazing team of research-
ers: Hanna Talley, Thaha Sherwani, 
Mikael Tessema. And to our talented 
press assistants, thank you so much: 
Gabriel Avalos, Gracie Kanigher, Riya 
Vashi, and Sidney Johnson. 
Two people who do an amazing job 
reaching out to the community: Cietta 
Kiandoli and Julietta Lopez—incred-
ible. They talk to all the groups and 
make them feel part of what we are 
doing and they know what we are 
doing. It is so wonderful, the job they 
do. And a brilliant legislative team— 
brilliant. ‘‘Brilliant’’ is an overused 
word, but it is not overused in the case 
of my staff. The ideas they come up 
with, the way they manage to get ev-
erything done. It is amazing. 
So there is Adrian Deveny and Tim 
Ryder, Matt Fuentes, Dili—it is a hard, 
long last name. I always call him Dili. 
I’m 
glad 
it 
is 
just 
Dili. 
It 
is 
Sundaramoorthy. How did I—Where is 
he? Oh, he is not here to correct me. 
Good. 
Anna Taylor. Anna Taylor is so damn 
dedicated. She had a baby 2 days ago, 
and she is still on the phone talking. 
And I said: Anna, stop. 
No, no, no. She was so dedicated and 
put so much time into this that she 
kept working. And her little beautiful 
child, Posey. We heard her crying hap-
pily in the background as we were mov-
ing through all of this. Jon Cardinal— 
an amazing guy who worked so hard on 
this and on CHIP fab—Reggie Babin on 
counsel, Rob Hickman, Annie Daly, 
Ramon Carranza, Catalina Tam, Sam 
Rodarte, 
Jillian 
McGrath, 
Justine 
Revelle, Ryan Eagan, Didier Barjon, 
Grace Magaletta, Bre Sonnier-Thomp-
son, 
Vandan 
Patel, 
Leela 
Najafi, 
Leeann Sinpatanaskul, Jeff Dickson, 
Mike 
Kuiken, 
Lane 
Bodian, 
Reza 
Zomorrodian, Yazeed Abdelhaq, Beth 
Vrabel, Kai Vogel, Josh Gutmaker, and 
Gunnar Haberl. 
And the floor staff—you know, there 
are certain people you say: We couldn’t 
have done it without you, and a bunch 
of the names I have mentioned fall in 
the ‘‘couldn’t have done it without 
you’’ category. But we all know that 
just the wisdom and the knowledge and 
the history that is in his bones and 
brain just make him indispensable, and 
that is Gary Myrick. 
Is he here? He is very modest. So I 
am going to make him mad. We should 
all applaud him. He hates it. 
(Cheers and applause.) 
And, of course, Tricia Engle, his 
great deputy, and the wonderful team 
on the floor and in the cloakroom: 
Stephanie 
Paone, 
Rachel 
Jackson, 
Nate Oursler, Daniel Tinsley, Brad 
Watt, Jacky Usyk, Maalik Simmons, 
and Miriam Wheatley. 
And, of course, my tech and IT team, 
what a great bunch. And for someone 
who is not very tech-oriented, his team 
is indispensable, too: Scott Rodman, 
Hemen Mehta, Jon Housley, and Amy 
Mannering.

And more staffers who work here 
every 
day 
in 
Washington—and 
we 
didn’t name a lot of my staff in New 
York. I will just throw in the name of 
Steve Mann, who has been our deputy 
director since I started in the Senate 
and does a wonderful job. They all do, 
but I just wanted to mention him. And 
we commiserate with Mike Lynch over 
the Yankees, who are losing a lot of 
games these days.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
want them to know how much I appre-
ciate their work, how great a difference 
they have made. This bill is going to 
change America for decades, and you 
did it. Wherever you go, whatever you 
do, you should never forget how much 
you have helped make the world and 
the globe a better place—never forget 
it. 
So, to every single staffer on my 
team, to staffers in other offices, com-
mittees here on the floor: Thank you, 
thank you, thank you, very, very 
much. 
I yield the floor because Mr. PADILLA 
has some important words about a New 
Yorker. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The junior Senator from Cali-
fornia. 
TRIBUTE TO VINCENT ‘‘VIN’’ SCULLY 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, as 
Mr. SCHUMER said, I rise today to honor 
the life and mourn the passing of Vin-
cent ‘‘Vin’’ Scully, who will be remem-
bered as the greatest broadcaster in 
sports history, and a true ambassador 
for Los Angeles, the Dodgers, and the 
game of baseball. 
Born in 1927 in the Bronx, he grew up 
near the Polo Grounds and actually be-
came a big fan of the New York Giants 
baseball team as a child—and I never 
held that against him. 
He served our Nation as a member of 
the U.S. Navy for 2 years before attend-
ing Fordham University. And at Ford-
ham—listen to this—at Fordham, he 
managed to play on the baseball team, 
work on the school paper, and broad-
cast many of the university’s football, 
baseball, and basketball teams. 
His career as a broadcaster took off 
soon after he graduated from college. 
By 1950, he joined the Brooklyn Dodg-
ers broadcast team. And in 1954, he be-
came the team’s principal announcer— 
a position he would hold until his re-
tirement in 2016. He was the longest 
tenured announcer for any team in any 
professional sport. 
In 1953, at only age 25, Vin became 
the youngest person to ever broadcast 
a World Series—a record that remains 
to this day. 
When the Dodgers moved from New 
York to Los Angeles in 1958, Vin moved 
with the team, and he quickly became 
the voice of baseball in Southern Cali-
fornia. 
Vin was the voice of the Dodgers for 
67 years, but his unparalleled story-
telling and love of sports allowed him 
to transcend baseball. Many fans will 
recall Vin’s unique calls on some of the 
most memorable football games and 
golf tournaments of the 20th century. 
He was also a presence in pop cul-
ture, appearing in dozens of movies, TV 
shows, and documentaries. Vin lent his 
talents to everything ranging from the 
sketch comedy series ‘‘Laugh-In’’ to 
the iconic science fiction show ‘‘The X- 
Files,’’ to the classic baseball movie— 
and one of my favorites—‘‘For the Love 
of the Game’’; and he relished serving 
as grand marshal of the 125th Rose Pa-
rade ahead of the 2014 Rose Bowl. 
In 2016, President Obama awarded 
Vin Scully the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, recognizing Vin as one of the 
signature sounds of America’s pastime. 
Ever humble, when Vin was informed 
that he would be receiving the honor, 
he asked: ‘‘Are you sure?’’ 
From Opening Day to the World Se-
ries, and every inning in between, Vin 
made every game memorable with his 
love of baseball, and for generations of 
fans—generations—hearing 
Vin 
Scully’s soothing voice meant it was 
time for Dodgers baseball. 
Now, I grew up in the San Fernando 
Valley. As a child, growing up in the 
1980s, I spent many evenings dreaming 
of growing up to play professional base-
ball while listening to Vin’s voice nar-
rate the action. 
While he became a legend for his tal-
ents behind the microphone, he will ac-
tually be remembered best for his de-
cency beyond the broadcast booth. I re-
member a few years ago, when I was

August 6, 2022 
serving as California’s secretary of 
state, I had an opportunity to intro-
duce Angela and two of our sons to Vin 
at a voter registration event before the 
game at Dodgers Stadium. He was just 
so incredibly gracious with my family; 
it is a memory that we will cherish. 
But I also know that we weren’t 
unique in that interaction with Vin. He 
always made time for fans—regardless 
of age, regardless of occupation—wher-
ever and whenever he met them. You 
see, he wasn’t just a sports broad-
caster; he was a figure larger than life, 
and he made all of us feel like family. 
Angela and I certainly join the Los 
Angeles community, the Dodgers orga-
nization, and baseball fans around the 
world in mourning the passing of Vin 
Scully. Our hearts go out to the entire 
Scully family. 
I yield the floor.

COLOMBIA 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on 
August 7, Colombia’s newly elected 
President Gustavo Petro and Vice 
President Francia Marquez will begin 
their 4-year term. Their election rep-
resents a sharp break from the past. 
The new government is inheriting 
every 
imaginable 
problem. 
Regret-
tably, the country has made minimal 
progress since the signing of the 2016 
Peace Accord that ended five decades 
of armed conflict with the FARC, and 
in some parts of the country, nar-
cotics-related violence is worse. The 
previous government failed to make a 
dent in the number of assassinations of 
social leaders or to hold members of 
the armed forces and police account-
able for past atrocities. Compounded 
by the public health and economic 
shocks caused by the Covid-19 pan-
demic and a flood of Venezuelan refu-
gees, Colombia remains a highly polar-
ized society, divided between urban 
elites and the impoverished country-
side. It will take many years to reverse 
decades of deeply rooted neglect, dis-
crimination, poverty, and lawlessness.

vested more than $11 billion in a

August 6, 2022 
counter-drug strategy in Colombia that 
was never sustainable and has largely 
failed, as it has failed in Mexico and 
Central America. As long as the de-
mand for illegal drugs in this country 
remains high, the only solution in 
source countries like Colombia is a 
strategy based on sustainable social 
and economic development, a profes-
sional, accountable police force, and a 
judiciary that is independent, acces-
sible, and that the people trust. 
Colombia has the advantage of being 
a democracy with exceptionally tal-
ented people and extraordinary geo-
graphic and biological diversity. But if 
the underlying causes of conflict and 
poverty are not addressed, the coun-
try’s future stability is far from as-
sured. I urge the White House, the 
State Department, and the Defense De-
partment against pursuing the same 
old failed strategies. With a new gov-
ernment in Bogota, there is the chance 
to avoid repeating past mistakes and 
to measure progress not in the short 
term by the amount of money spent or 
the number of hectares of coca de-
stroyed, but by long-term investments 
in institutions and local communities. 
The people of rural Colombia need our 
support, but not in the form of myopic 
approaches 
that 
have 
consistently 
failed to get at the root of the injus-
tice, impunity, and inequality they 
have been struggling with for genera-
tions. 
The U.S. Congress will do its part to 
support a strategy designed by the Co-
lombians that is not just more of the 
same, that is consistent with the peace 
accord, that has the support of civil so-
ciety, and, most importantly, that has 
the support of rural Colombians who 
have paid the highest price of past poli-
cies that have failed them. 
f 
SOUTH SUDAN 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
have spoken twice this year about the 
despair and insecurity that are a daily 
reality for the people of South Sudan, 
despite independence 11 years ago that 
held so much promise and hope for that 
country. 
On January 6 and 31, I noted that the 
country’s independence was a result of 
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement— 
CPA—which took years of negotiations 
facilitated in part by the United 
States, Norway, and the United King-
dom. It provided a roadmap for polit-
ical stability, economic development, 
respect for human rights, and justice. I 
further noted that since then, two 
former warlords, President Kiir and 
First Vice President Machar—who were 
never elected—have dominated the po-
litical landscape. It is they, throughout 
these formative years, who have had 
the executive power and the responsi-
bility to turn the aspirations of inde-
pendence into meaningful improve-
ments in the lives of their people. 
Eleven years later, the country is in 
a state of political paralysis, and its 
people are coping with a widening hu-
manitarian crisis, brought on by vio-
lence instigated by government secu-
rity 
forces, 
severe 
flooding, 
sky-
rocketing fuel costs, and acute food 
shortages compounded by the war in 
Ukraine which was a major source of 
grain imports for South Sudan. Mil-
lions of people have been displaced 
from their homes by the fighting, 
flooding, and hunger. 
I will not take time today to recount 
the litany of failures of the Kiir- 
Machar government which I enumer-
ated in January and which have only 
worsened since then. Rather, I want to 
call the Senate’s attention to a Vati-
can mission of peace, unity, and rec-
onciliation to South Sudan in early 
July. The visit by Cardinal Pietro 
Parolin came at a time when the coun-
try’s leaders are apparently, though 
not surprisingly, seeking to evade elec-
tions and extend their stay in office il-
legitimately, even though the peace 
agreement mandated that elections be 
held this December. 
Kiir and Machar have now proposed 
extending 
their 
unpopular 
authori-
tarian rule for 3 years without the con-
sent of the people of South Sudan. The 
parliamentary faction of President Kiir 
has passed a political parties bill in 
which they have changed political par-
ties’ registration requirements in order 
to limit those who could pose a serious 
challenge to their continued hold on 
power. The text of the bill that was ne-
gotiated and agreed to by the parties 
was changed by Kiir’s parliamentary 
caucus and rammed through the Par-
liament despite boycott and serious ob-
jections from the other parties. All 
these actions provide sufficient evi-
dence to suggest that President Kiir 
and Machar are determined to cling to 
power by any means necessary. 
It is no secret that President Kiir 
and his Deputy Machar have made the 
conditions for holding free and fair 
elections impossible, for all the reasons 
noted earlier. The country’s leaders 
have done nothing to prepare for elec-
tions, preferring instead to retain 
power by default. By fomenting civil 
unrest and violence and threatening 
and arresting their critics, they have 
transformed the peace agreement into 
a meaningless document. Rather than 
peace and prosperity, it has brought 
dictatorship, corruption, violence, and 
misery. 
As I said on January 31: 
The sad reality is that while the South Su-
danese people won their independence from 
Sudan, they remain captives of the same 
ruthless and corrupt warlords who created so 
much ethnic conflict, bloodshed, and misery 
during the civil war and who have not been 
held accountable. 
They simply reinvented themselves as po-
litical leaders, with a stamp of legitimacy 
from the international community, while 
continuing to act like the warlords they are 
and always were. 
They have shown no interest in imple-
menting the R-ARCSS or any other peace 
agreement. 
They have shown no interest in the welfare 
of their people. 
They have shown no interest in anything 
except holding onto power, avoiding justice, 
and enriching themselves. 
Real peace requires justice, and it re-
quires respect for fundamental rights 
regardless of ethnicity, race, or reli-
gion. It requires free and fair elections 
and equitable economic development. 
Cardinal Pietro Parolin conveyed a 
clear message to President Kiir and 
Vice President Machar. Their churches 
played an indispensable role in the 
international effort that culminated in 
the 2005 comprehensive peace agree-
ment, and they, too, have a stake in its 
success. Above all, President Kiir and 
Vice President Machar should know 
that the world is watching. 
The ethnic and political violence, 
displacements, and destruction of vil-
lages 
and 
food 
stocks 
perpetrated 
against South Sudanese civilians in 
different parts of the country, includ-
ing by forces loyal to them, must stop. 
The arbitrary arrests, sexual assaults 
and rape, forced disappearance, and 
killings of religious, civil society, and 
political leaders must stop and justice 
done for the victims. 
Those currently detained arbitrarily 
must be released, including Kuel Aguer 
Kuel, the former governor of Northern 
Bahr El-Ghazal, and Pastor Abraham 
Chol Maketh. 
The daily corruption in South Sudan, 
including illegal loans and growing 
debt burden that has impoverished the 
current and future generations, must 
end, and South Sudan must begin to 
feed and care for its own people from 
its existing resources, which are suffi-
cient if used prudently. 
President Kiir and Riek Machar are 
responsible for the chronic hunger, in-
security, economic, and political crises 
in the country, and they have the 
power to bring peace and stability to 
South Sudan, which is a matter of ur-
gent priority. 
But the country is certain to disinte-
grate further if Kiir and Machar con-
tinue to hold it hostage to their indi-
vidual interests at the expense of the 
lives and livelihoods of the South Su-
danese people. They must prepare to 
step down and allow the country to re-
cover and rebuild from the ruins of 
their policies. 
I commend South Sudanese civil so-
ciety and pro-democracy movements, 
such as the People’s Coalition for Civic 
Action—PCCA—for their efforts in cre-
ating awareness about the plight of the 
people of South Sudan and for their 
nonviolent campaign for freedom and 
democracy. They have our support. 
Finally, I want to again urge the 
Biden administration to listen to the 
people of South Sudan. I commend re-
cent steps by the State Department to 
recognize the fallacy of continuing to 
support a failed peace agreement that 
South Sudan’s own leaders do not sup-
port, and I urge the European Union 
and Intergovernmental Authority for 
Development—IGAD—countries 
to 
take similar action. There is no point 
in admonishing two failed leaders to

implement a peace agreement they 
have no intention of implementing. 
That is not a policy. It is a dead end. 
Instead, the administration should 
join with other key governments and 
stakeholders in exploring the possi-
bility of recreating a new political 
forum for South Sudan to address the 
challenge of the looming end of the 
transitional government and the re-
ality of the impracticality of con-
ducting democratic elections in the 
current environment. Given the failure 
of the leaders of the current transi-
tional government, it is unacceptable 
to extend its mandate. It should be 
brought to an end. I also urge the IGAD 
governments, 
particularly 
President 
Museveni of Uganda and President 
Uhuru Kenya of Kenya, and the other 
regional leaders, to face the fact that 
the Revitalized Agreement on the Res-
olution of Conflict in South Sudan—R- 
ARCSS—they helped mediate has been 
sabotaged by South Sudan’s leaders. 
The time has come to do what is need-
ed to help the South Sudanese people 
get back on a path to achieve their 
democratic aspirations and freedoms. 
South Sudan needs a new broad-based 
political dialogue that is inclusive of 
all political forces and civil society. 
This political dialogue, which many 
political 
parties 
and 
organizations 
have endorsed, should focus on peace 
and stability in South Sudan beyond 
the confines of power sharing, taking 
into account key provisions of the R- 
ARCSS, combined with the outcomes 
of the South Sudan national dialogue. 
Such a broad-based political dialogue 
should aim at reaffirming a shared vi-
sion for South Sudan and building con-
sensus on political and constitutional 
matters, ending violence, saving lives, 
uniting the nation, and preparing for 
elections. 
The dialogue process should cul-
minate in the establishment of an in-
terim administration led by persons of 
consensus, technocrats, and individuals 
not politically aligned with the war-
ring parties and not entangled in cor-
ruption and political violence. Such an 
administration should have a limited 
mandate to further political dialogue, 
rebuild public trust in government, 
strengthen the unified forces, deliver 
the constitution, return the IDPs and 
refugees, conduct a census, and cul-
minate in free and fair elections. 
The Biden administration should ar-
ticulate a new policy that reinvigo-
rates U.S. engagement and supports 
peace, stability, and democracy in 
South Sudan. No one should be under 
any illusion that this can achieved 
quickly or easily. But without a com-
petent or credible government to en-
gage with, we must shift our focus to 
providing strong support to pro-democ-
racy, nonviolent organizations to cre-
ate the grassroots pressure necessary 
for a genuine political dialogue to take

TRIBUTE TO NORMAN LEAR 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, a re-
markable American marked his 100th 
birthday last month. Marcelle and I 
were delighted to be able to wish Nor-
man Lear our best on this milestone. 
His 
achievements 
throughout 
his 
impactful life have broken important 
new ground at just about every turn. 
We all know Norman’s credits in tele-
vision, such as ‘‘All in the Family,’’ 
‘‘The Jeffersons,’’ and ‘‘Maude.’’ They 
helped shape 20th century American 
culture. 
Norman’s influence on America did 
not start in television. He was an U.S. 
Army Air Force pilot in World War II, 
flying more than 50 combat missions 
over Italy and Germany, and his her-
oism garnered the Air Medal with four 
oak leaf clusters. 
Norman’s patriotism and public serv-
ice continued throughout his television 
career. He addressed pressing social 
issues in ways others were not willing 
to do, touching hearts, and changing 
lives. The core of his message was al-
ways to bring people together on com-
mon ground, an idea which is so des-
perately needed today in all facets of 
our culture and media. 
He founded People For The American 
Way, to champion American ideals 
that often were under fire or dimin-
ished by apathy. 
Norman Lear has always understood 
that more things unite us than divide 
us as Americans, and to quote him, 
‘‘we are all in this life together.’’ 
I was moved by his reflections, pub-
lished in the New York Times on July 
27, 2022, his 100th birthday, and ask 
unanimous consent to have them print-
ed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, July 27, 2022] 
ON MY 100TH BIRTHDAY, REFLECTIONS ON 
ARCHIE BUNKER AND DONALD TRUMP 
(By Norman Lear) 
Well, I made it. I am 100 years old today. 
I wake up every morning grateful to be alive. 
Reaching my own personal centennial is 
cause for a bit of reflection on my first cen-
tury—and on what the next century will 
bring for the people and country I love. To be 
honest, I’m a bit worried that I may be in 
better shape than our democracy is. 
I was deeply troubled by the attack on 
Congress on Jan. 6, 2021—by supporters of 
former President Donald Trump attempting 
to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. 
Those concerns have only grown with every 
revelation about just how far Mr. Trump was 
willing to go to stay in office after being re-
jected by voters—and about his ongoing ef-
forts to install loyalists in positions with the 
power to sway future elections. 
I don’t take the threat of authoritarianism 
lightly. As a young man, I dropped out of 
college when the Japanese attacked Pearl 
Harbor and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces. 
I flew more than 50 missions in a B–17 bomb-
er to defeat fascism consuming Europe. I am 
a flag-waving believer in truth, justice and 
the American way, and I don’t understand 
how so many people who call themselves pa-
triots can support efforts to undermine our 
democracy and our Constitution. It is alarm-
ing. 
At the same time, I have been moved by 
the courage of the handful of conservative 
Republican lawmakers, lawyers and former 
White House staffers who resisted Mr. 
Trump’s bullying. They give me hope that 
Americans can find unexpected common 
ground with friends and family whose poli-
tics differ but who are not willing to sac-
rifice core democratic principles. 
Encouraging that kind of conversation was 
a goal of mine when we began broadcasting 
‘‘All in the Family’’ in 1971. The kinds of 
topics Archie Bunker and his family argued 
about—issues that were dividing Americans 
from one another, such as racism, feminism, 
homosexuality, the Vietnam War and Water-
gate—were certainly being talked about in 
homes and families. They just weren’t being 
acknowledged on television. 
For all his faults, Archie loved his country 
and he loved his family, even when they 
called him out on his ignorance and bigot-
ries. If Archie had been around 50 years 
later, he probably would have watched Fox 
News. He probably would have been a Trump 
voter. But I think that the sight of the 
American flag being used to attack Capitol 
Police would have sickened him. I hope that 
the resolve shown by Representatives Liz 
Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, and their com-
mitment to exposing the truth, would have 
won his respect. 
It is remarkable to consider that tele-
vision—the medium for which I am most 
well-known—did not even exist when I was 
born, in 1922. The internet came along dec-
ades later, and then social media. We have 
seen that each of these technologies can be 
put to destructive use—spreading lies, sow-
ing hatred and creating the conditions for 
authoritarianism to take root. But that is 
not the whole story. Innovative technologies 
create new ways for us to express ourselves, 
and, I hope, will allow humanity to learn 
more about itself and better understand one 
another’s ideas, failures and achievements. 
These technologies have also been used to 
create connection, community and platforms 
for the kind of ideological sparring that 
might have drawn Archie to a keyboard. I 
can only imagine the creative and construc-
tive possibilities that technological innova-
tion might offer us in solving some of our 
most intractable problems. 
I often feel disheartened by the direction 
that our politics, courts and culture are tak-
ing. But I do not lose faith in our country or 
its future. I remind myself how far we have 
come. I think of the brilliantly creative peo-
ple I have had the pleasure to work with in 
entertainment and politics, and at People for 
the American Way, a progressive group I co- 
founded to defend our freedoms and build a 
country in which all people benefit from the 
blessings of liberty. Those encounters renew 
my belief that Americans will find ways to 
build solidarity on behalf of our values, our 
country and our fragile planet. 
Those closest to me know that I try to 
stay forward-focused. Two of my favorite 
words are ‘‘over’’ and ‘‘next.’’ It’s an attitude 
that has served me well through a long life 
of ups and downs, along with a deeply felt 
appreciation for the absurdity of the human 
condition. 
Reaching this birthday with my health and 
wits mostly intact is a privilege. Approach-
ing it with loving family, friends and cre-
ative collaborators to share my days has 
filled me with a gratitude I can hardly ex-
press. 
This is our century, dear reader, yours and 
mine. Let us encourage one another with vi-
sions of a shared future. And let us bring all 
the grit and openheartedness and creative 
spirit we can muster to gather together and 
build that future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4207 
August 6, 2022 
PREVENTING CHILD SEX ABUSE 
ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
have long fought to protect victims of 
violent crime. Victims of sexual as-
sault, especially children who are vic-
timized by sexual predators, must be 
safeguarded. I have worked to ensure 
the Violence Against Women Act is 
funded. I steered through the Senate 
and into law the Survivor’s Bill of 
Rights in the States Act. And I have 
introduced the Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act to support victims of 
human trafficking. I have fought and 
will continue to fight for victims of 
violent crime. 
When I was the chairman of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, I convened 
the first congressional hearing on pro-
tecting young athletes from sexual 
abuse. I conducted aggressive oversight 
into the U.S. Olympic Committee’s re-
sponse following the scandal involving 
disgraced 
Olympic 
physician 
Larry 
Nassar. And I worked to ensure that 
the Protecting Young Victims from 
Sexual Abuse Act became law, which 
requires instructors, coaches, and oth-
ers who work with young athletes to 
report cases of child sexual abuse to 
the authorities. But more needs to be 
done. 
I continue to press the Department of 
Justice for more answers on the FBI’s 
handling of the Nassar case and why 
Nassar wasn’t federally charged for his 
heinous physical abuse against our 
Olympic gymnasts. My oversight in 
this area has brought to the surface 
more information about how our legal 
system fails victims of abuse, espe-
cially children. Our outdated laws 
aren’t keeping pace with how predators 
develop new tricks and use new tech-
nology. 
Children are a gift, but they are vul-
nerable. They must be protected—not 
taken advantage of. As a father and a 
grandfather, the safety and welfare of 
the next generation is a deeply per-
sonal issue to me. 
Today, I am pleased to announce that 
I, along with Senator OSSOFF, am in-
troducing the Preventing Child Sexual 
Abuse Act. We are confident this bill 
will make children—both at home and 
around the world—safer from the pred-
ators who want to sexually abuse 
them. 
I have worked extensively with the 
Department of Justice’s Child Exploi-
tation and Obscenity Section to get 
their feedback and hear about what 
legislative tools they need to protect 
children. I look forward to continuing 
this partnership with them as we im-
prove this legislation. 
Victims and advocacy groups focused 
on this issue endorse this bill, includ-
ing: 
U.S. 
Olympic 
medalist 
Tasha 
Schwikert, the Army of Survivors, the 
National and International Centers for 
Missing and Exploited Children, the 
National Center on Sexual Exploi-
tation, 
Stop 
Child 
Predators, 
Rights4Girls, the Keep Kids Safe Move-
ment, the National Association of As-
sistant United States Attorneys, and 
the Iowa County Attorneys Associa-
tion. I appreciate their contributions 
and suggestions in improving this bill 
and their tireless efforts to keep chil-
dren safe from the scourge of this kind 
of abuse. 
This bill gives prosecutors more tools 
in their toolbox to get child abusers 
away from children. One of the sections 
in my bill will now make it possible for 
Federal prosecutors to charge the likes 
of Larry Nassar with a Federal crime 
for his abuse of our gymnasts. Another 
section ensures that Americans who 
travel abroad under the guise of busi-
ness or charitable work to abuse chil-
dren will be held accountable. The final 
section of this bill modernizes our un-
derstanding of child sexual abuse in the 
digital age. 
I wish legislation like this wasn’t 
necessary, but it is. We have to crack 
down on violent crime against chil-
dren, and we shouldn’t wait another 
minute to act. I look forward to work-
ing with my fellow Senators to pass 
this legislation quickly and keep our 
children safe from predators.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
section 3002 of S. Con. Res. 14, the fis-
cal year 2022 congressional budget reso-
lution, allows the chairman of the Sen-
ate Budget Committee to revise budget 
aggregates, committee allocations, and 
the pay-as-you-go ledger for legislation 
considered under the resolution’s rec-
onciliation instructions. 
I find that amendment No. 5194, as 
modified, fulfills the conditions found 
in section 3002 of S. Con. Res. 14. Ac-
cordingly, I am revising the allocations 
for nine of the reconciled committees 
and revising other enforceable budg-
etary levels to account for the budg-
etary effects of the amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustments, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
section 3002 of S. Con. Res. 14, the fis-
cal year 2022 congressional budget reso-
lution, allows the chairman of the Sen-
ate Budget Committee to revise budget 
aggregates, committee allocations, and 
the pay-as-you-go ledger for legislation 
considered under the resolution’s rec-
onciliation instructions. 
I find that amendment No. 5209, ful-
fills the conditions found in section 
3002 of S. Con. Res. 14. Accordingly, I 
am further revising the allocations for 
five reconciled committees and other 
enforceable budgetary levels to ac-
count for the budgetary effects of the 
amendment. 
This adjustment applies while this 
amendment is under consideration. 
Should the amendment be withdrawn 
or fail, this adjustment will be null and 
void and the adjustment for amend-
ment No. 5194 shall remain active. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustments, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, Sen-
ate Democrats have stepped up and 
passed legislation that will make it 
easier for American families to afford 
health insurance coverage and pre-
scription drugs and lower energy costs 
and boost domestic job creation in the 
growing clean energy sector. We have 
done so while reducing the deficit and 
without raising taxes on families and 
small businesses. The Inflation Reduc-
tion 
Act—IRA—tackles 
climate 
change, makes the Tax Code fairer, and 
invests in long-overdue environmental 
justice programs. This is an historic 
bill, and polling indicates that large 
majorities of Americans support its 
major provisions. 
While a simple majority of Senators 
can pass a budget reconciliation bill, 
there was nothing to prevent our Re-
publican colleagues from joining us in 
supporting this measure to lower es-
sential costs for American families and 
enhance our economic and national se-
curity. These are policies that all Sen-
ators and all Members of Congress 
should embrace, and this legislation 
contains many bipartisan policies. Rec-
onciliation does not have to be a par-
tisan process. Just in the past year, the 
Senate passed the Infrastructure In-
vestment 
and 
Jobs 
Act—IIJA—the 
CHIPS + Science semiconductor manu-
facturing bill, the Honoring Our PACT 
Act, and Treaty Document No. 117–3, 
which contains Protocols to the North 
Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Acces-
sion of the Republic of Finland and the 
Kingdom of Sweden, with strong bipar-
tisan majorities. I regret that our Re-
publican colleagues did not join us 
today in passing the IRA. 
As for me, if asked to choose between 
the status quo or lowering health cov-
erage costs for Maryland families and 
having large companies pay a min-
imum, fair share of taxes, there is no 
contest. I will choose Maryland fami-
lies every day. I find it incomprehen-
sible that anyone—other than perhaps 
some billionaires—thinks it is accept-
able that teachers, nurses, and me-
chanics and most small businesses 
often pay a greater percentage of their 
income in Federal taxes than the 
ultrawealthy or a company that makes 
billions of dollars in profits. The bill 
we passed today changes that calcula-
tion and holds the richest Americans 
and companies that make over a billion 
dollars accountable for paying their 
fair share of taxes, like everyone else 
in this country. 
This past Wednesday, Timothy F. 
Geithner, Jacob J. Lew, Henry M. 
Paulson Jr., Robert E. Rubin and Law-
rence H. Summers issued the following 
statement: 
As former Treasury Secretaries of both 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
Administra-
tions, we support the Inflation Reduction 
Act, which is financed by prudent tax policy 
that will collect more from top-earners and 
large corporations. Taxes due or paid will 
not increase for any family making less than 
$400,000/year. And the extra taxes levied on 
corporations do not reflect increases in the 
corporate tax rate, but rather the reclaiming 
of revenue lost to tax avoidance and provi-
sions benefitting the most affluent. The se-
lective presentation by some of the distribu-
tional effects of this bill neglects benefits to 
middle-class families from reducing deficits, 
from bringing down prescription drug prices, 
and from more affordable energy. This legis-
lation will help increase American competi-
tiveness, address our climate crisis, lower 
costs for families, and fight inflation—and 
should be passed immediately by Congress. 
The original top-line estimates from 
the 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office— 
CBO—and the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation—JCT—were that the bill would 
raise $725 billion in revenue, invest $433 
billion, and apply the balance—nearly 
$300 billion—to deficit reduction. These 
numbers will change some with the 
final score, but they illustrate the 
magnitude of what this bill will accom-
plish. The IRA will help to build a bet-
ter America for all Americans. 
Let’s start with health care. The bill 
we passed today will lower prescription 
drug prices and make healthcare more 
affordable for millions of Americans. 
Finally, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services will have the author-
ity to negotiate lower drug prices for 
the 
Medicare 
Program, 
benefitting 
both millions of seniors on fixed in-
comes and taxpayers. In the private 
sector, no plan sponsor or manager 
would ever accept responsibility with-
out the ability to decide how to nego-
tiate. Medicare negotiation will ensure 
that patients with Medicare get the 
best deal possible on high-priced drugs, 
saving Medicare approximately $100 
billion. 
The IRA will further lower drug costs 
for seniors by capping out-of-pocket 
costs for part D prescriptions at $2,000 
each year, requiring drug manufactur-
ers to pay penalties if they raise their 
prices faster than inflation, and delay-
ing of the Trump administration’s drug 
rebate rule. Although these provisions 
alone will lower beneficiary costs, the 
IRA also lowers costs through a rede-
sign of the Medicare Part D formula, 
expansion of the low-income subsidy— 
LIS—in part D, and Federal coverage 
for vaccines. 
The IRA also invests $64 billion to ex-
tend ACA healthcare premium sub-
sidies through 2025. These subsidies, 
first provided through the American 
Rescue Plan, have guaranteed millions 
of 
Americans 
access 
to 
affordable 
health insurance. Access to affordable 
health insurance saves lives and re-
duces costs because people get the care 
they need and they get it sooner. As 
Benjamin Franklin said, ‘‘An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure.’’ 
The IRA will save Maryland families 
with median income about $2,200 annu-
ally. 
The IRA raises several hundred bil-
lion dollars by making the Tax Code 
fairer through three major provisions. 
The first provides up to $80 billion to 
the Internal Revenue Service—IRS—to 
modernize its computer systems, some 
of which are 60 years old, and rebuild 
its workforce to ensure greater tax 
compliance. CBO estimates that in-
vesting $80 billion in tax enforcement 
and compliance will generate $203 bil-
lion in additional revenue over the 
next 10 years. 
Since 2010, the IRS budget has been 
cut by roughly 20 percent, and the 
budget earmarked for enforcement has 
dropped by 24 percent. Audit rates for 
the 
largest 
corporations 
and 
the 
ultrawealthy have fallen dramatically, 
by 54 and 71 percent, respectively. We 
now have the perverse situation where 
the poorest American families are au-
dited at about the same rate as the top 
1 
percent 
richest 
taxpayers, 
even 
though that 1 percent is responsible for 
28 percent the ‘‘tax gap,’’ the difference 
between taxes owed and collected. Ac-
cording to recent polling, nearly three- 
quarters of Americans believe the IRS 
should conduct more tax audits of 
large corporations and millionaires. 
The IRA provides 10-year funding for 
the IRS as follows: $3.2 billion for tax-
payer services; $45.6 billion for enforce-
ment; $25.3 billion for operations sup-
port; and $4.8 billion for business sys-
tems modernization. 
These appropriated funds are to re-
main available until September 30, 
2031, and no use of the funds is intended 
to increase taxes on any taxpayer with 
taxable income below $400,000. 
The bill also makes it easier for the 
IRS to establish a free, direct e-file tax 
return system. The IRS currently 
outsources its free e-file program to 
private, for-profit tax preparers. Not 
surprisingly, only 3 percent of tax-
payers—of 70 percent eligible—use the 
existing free e-file option. 
The second major provision estab-
lishes a minimum corporate income 
tax of 15 percent of book income on 
fewer than 200 of the Nation’s largest 
corporations that currently pay less 
than the statutory corporate tax rate, 
which is 21 percent. The corporate al-
ternative minimum tax—CAMT—pro-
posal would impose the 15 percent min-
imum tax on adjusted financial state-
ment—‘‘book’’—income 
for 
corpora-
tions with profits in excess of $1 bil-
lion. Corporations would generally be 
eligible to claim net operating losses 
and tax credits against the AMT and 
would be eligible to claim a tax credit 
against the regular corporate tax for 
AMT paid in prior years, to the extent

the regular tax liability in any year ex-
ceeds 15 percent of the corporation’s 
adjusted financial statement income. 
In 2020, 50 of the biggest corporations 
paid $0 in Federal corporate income 
tax, despite recording substantial prof-
its. Some of these companies effec-
tively had a negative Federal income 
tax because they received more in cred-
its and rebates than they paid in taxes. 
The AMT makes the existing corporate 
tax structure fairer, especially for 
smaller businesses that often pay their 
taxes at higher rates than the largest 
corporations. 
Consider 
that 
many 
small businesses pay taxes through the 
individual tax code, where the highest 
tax rate is as much as 37 percent. Set-
ting a baseline of taxes to be paid by 
the largest corporations gives small 
businesses a better chance to compete 
and succeed. 
The third provision is a 1 percent ex-
cise tax on stock buybacks. Corpora-
tions can choose to distribute profits 
either by issuing dividends or buying 
back shares of stock, which inflates 
stock prices. Stock buybacks are taxed 
at a lower rate than dividends and cre-
ate profit gaming opportunities for 
companies, which have been abused 
over time. By levying a small 1 percent 
tax on these buyback transactions, it 
improves tax efficiency and raises rev-
enue that will significantly contribute 
to deficit reduction. 
The IRA’s tax provisions will in-
crease compliance and close the tax 
gap, which costs the U.S. $1 trillion per 
year in unpaid taxes, according to the 
IRS. That is important for the revenue 
they raise. It is also important that 
millions of hard-working Americans 
who play by the rules and pay their 
taxes believe that the system is fair 
and that the ultrawealthy and large 
corporations aren’t dodging their fi-
nancial responsibilities. 
We need to address climate change by 
rapidly reducing our dependence on fos-
sil fuels and cutting our greenhouse 
gas emissions. The IRA does that. It 
will cut our emissions by 40 percent or 
more by 2030 and put us on track to 
meet 70 percent of our Paris agreement 
obligations. It contains a Methane 
Emissions Reduction Program to re-
duce leaks from the production and dis-
tribution of oil and natural gas. 
The IRA contains roughly $370 billion 
in clean energy, energy security, and 
climate change investments that will 
lower Americans’ electricity bills and 
prices at the pump and create as many 
as 9 million good-paying jobs here in 
America in the clean energy sector 
over the next decade. 
I am pleased the IRA includes a pro-
vision I have championed, a production 
tax credit for our existing fleet of nu-
clear reactors. They are an essential 
source of baseload power and provide 20 
percent of the Nation’s electricity and 
over 50 percent of our carbon-free elec-
tricity. 
According to the non-partisan Re-
sources for the Future, all told, the 
IRA will drive down retail costs of elec-
tricity by 5.2–6.7 percent over the next 
decade, saving electricity consumers 
$209-$278 billion. The average household 
will experience approximately $170-$220 
in annual savings from smaller elec-
tricity bills and reductions in the costs 
of goods and services over the next dec-
ade. The clean energy investments will 
help to insulate ratepayers from vola-
tility in natural gas prices, with elec-
tricity rates projected to decrease even 
under a high natural gas price sce-
nario. More importantly, the IRA will 
bolster our economic and national se-
curity by strengthening our grid and 
reducing reliance on foreign energy 
supplies. 
The legislation also includes a his-
toric expansion of a tax program I have 
led, the section 179D energy efficient 
commercial buildings deduction, which 
provides a tax deduction for energy ef-
ficient building investments. Energy 
efficiency is good business and good 
policy. This legislation will expand sec-
tion 179D, which was made permanent 
in 2020 under my leadership, to increase 
the deduction amount, improve its ad-
ministration, allow more nonprofits to 
use the deduction, and expand its use 
to building retrofits. 
In addition to the important steps 
the IRA takes to advance clean energy 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
the bill delivers major Federal invest-
ments 
to 
make 
our 
communities 
healthier, safer, and more resilient in 
the face of increasing impacts of cli-
mate change. It provides Federal as-
sistance for monitoring environmental 
quality, mitigating the harmful im-
pacts of air pollution and excessive 
heat, and enhancing walkability in our 
neighborhoods. It does this through $3 
billion for Neighborhood Access and 
Equity Grants and $3 billion for Envi-
ronmental and Climate Justice Block 
Grants. By targeting resources to dis-
advantaged or underserved commu-
nities, the bill advances equity in our 
infrastructure planning and invest-
ments. 
Climate change is happening now. We 
need to address its impacts on the 
ground. The IRA invests $2.6 billion for 
the conservation, restoration, and pro-
tection of coastal and marine habitats 
and resources, including fisheries, to 
enable coastal communities to prepare 
for extreme storms and other changing 
climate conditions, as well as $250 mil-
lion to rebuild and restore units of the 
National Wildlife Refuge System and 
State wildlife management areas. 
The bill supports America’s farmers 
and rural communities, with around 
$20 billion in funds for climate-smart 
agricultural practices through existing 
farm bill conservation programs, in-
cluding the regional conservation part-
nership program—RCPP—and $1 billion 
for the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service, to provide technical assistance 
on conservation to producers. Many 
sustainable practices such as expand-
ing cover crops and riparian buffers 
that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions 
and help farmers adapt to climate 
change also cost-effectively reduce pol-
lution to the Chesapeake Bay. 
The IRA makes investments to accel-
erate clean energy deployment, help 
achieve our climate goals, and create 
millions of jobs over the next decade. 
These investments include an expanded 
tax credit to support domestic manu-
facturing of clean energy technologies, 
including solar panels, wind turbines, 
and batteries; and tax credits that will 
make battery and fuel cell electric ve-
hicles—EVs—more affordable for mil-
lions of families. The bill provides over 
$9 billion for Federal procurement of 
American-made clean technologies, in-
cluding $3 billion for the U.S. Postal 
Service to purchase zero-emission vehi-
cles, helping to create a stable market 
for clean, Made in America products. 
Researchers Robert Pollin, Chirag 
Lala, and Shouvik Chakraborty at the 
University of Massachusetts-Amherst’s 
Political Economy Research Institute 
estimate that the IRA’s more than 100 
climate, environmental, and energy 
provisions will generate an average of 
about 912,000 jobs each year over the 
next decade through combined annual 
public and private investments of $98 
billion. 
The IRA tax credits and other provi-
sions won’t just help create jobs; they 
will help create jobs that pay pre-
vailing wages. The middle class has ex-
perienced wage stagnation for half a 
century. Income inequality has grown. 
The IRA will help to rebuild the middle 
class. Unions from the Communication 
Workers of America and the United 
Auto Workers to the National Treasury 
Employees Union and the International 
Federation of Professional and Tech-
nical Engineers all support the IRA be-
cause it promotes union jobs and ap-
prenticeships and because it will lower 
healthcare costs. 
In May, the Treasury Department es-
timated that the budget deficit this 
year will decline by $1.5 trillion. As 
President Biden noted at the time, 
‘‘The bottom line is that the deficit 
went up every year under my prede-
cessor before the pandemic and during 
the pandemic. And it’s gone down both 
years since I’ve been here. Period.’’ The 
IRA is fiscally responsible and will help 
reduce our budget deficits. 
Deficits remain too high, of course, 
but one of the best ways to address 
them is by getting unemployed Ameri-
cans back to work. The July jobs re-
port released on Friday put the unem-
ployment rate at 3.5 percent, matching 
the lowest it has been in 50 years. The 
U.S. economy added 528,000 jobs in 
July, more than twice the number 
economists 
anticipated. 
As 
Myles 
Udland, 
Senior 
Markets 
Editor 
of 
Yahoo! Finance, stated, 
This staggering increase in employment 
completes a milestone for the U.S. economy: 
Pre-pandemic employment is now fully re-
stored. 
In February 2020, the last month before the 
COVID–19 pandemic tipped the U.S. economy 
into recession, there were 152.504 million peo-
ple employed in the U.S. 
As of July 2022, 152.536 million people in 
the U.S. were working.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4212 
August 6, 2022 
And despite the labor market contraction 
during the pandemic being the sharpest in 
modern history, the bounce back marks the 
second-fastest job market recovery since 
1981. 
In a little over two years, we’ve seen job 
losses that topped 20 million at one point be 
fully erased. 
This recovery stands in stark contrast to 
the malaise we saw in the labor market fol-
lowing the financial crisis, when it took the 
better part of a decade for pre-crisis employ-
ment levels to be restored. 
Inflation is also too high, but its root 
causes are COVID–19 pandemic-related 
supply chain disruptions and Vladimir 
Putin’s war on Ukraine. The IRA tack-
les these disruptions by promoting do-
mestic 
manufacturing 
and 
supply 
chains and reducing our reliance on 
foreign energy. On August 2, 2022, over 
120 prominent economists wrote a let-
ter to Senate and House leadership 
stating that the IRA ‘‘addresses some 
of the country’s biggest challenges at a 
significant scale. And because it is def-
icit-reducing, it does so while putting 
downward pressure on inflation.’’ 
There is much to celebrate in this 
bill, but there are many priorities that 
we were not able to add. This ‘‘to do’’ 
list includes reinstating the expanded 
child tax credit and making child care 
accessible and affordable. My priority 
list includes legislation I have long 
championed to expand dental coverage 
to Medicare beneficiaries, as well as to 
Medicaid beneficiaries, along with ex-
pansions to home and community- 
based and maternal health services. 
Congress also needs to address housing 
supply and economic development pri-
orities, including the Neighborhood 
Homes Investment Act, the Low-In-
come Housing Tax Credit, the New 
Markets Tax Credit, and the Historic 
Tax Credit. While the IRA will help 
create good-paying union jobs, we need 
to do more to protect and enhance 
workers’ rights to form and join unions 
and engage in collective bargaining. 
And I will continue working to fund 
water infrastructure programs the IIJA 
created to address urgent affordability 
and resilience issues. 
While that seems like a long list, we 
must not let the perfect be the enemy 
of the good, and the IRA is so much 
better 
than 
good. 
It 
is 
trans-
formational legislation, and I am proud 
to support it. I want to commend Ma-
jority Leader SCHUMER and so many of 
my colleagues who have worked dili-
gently both in the spotlight and behind 
the scenes to bring us to this point. I 
also want to acknowledge committee 
and personal staff; CBO and JCT staff; 
Senate 
Parliamentarian 
Elizabeth 
MacDonough and her crew; leadership, 
floor, and cloakroom staff; the Senate 
legislative counsels; and others. You 
toil anonymously, but I hope you know 
how important you are. The Senate 
could not function without you. You 
are among our Nation’s finest public 
servants, and you are making a critical 
difference in the lives of all Americans. 
The American essayist Charles Dud-
ley Warner famously said, ‘‘Everybody 
complains about the weather, but no-
body does anything about it’’—a quote 
commonly misattributed to his friend 
Mark Twain. Passing a reconciliation 
bill is like that. We all complain about 
the process, especially the so-called 
vote-a-rama, which is grueling and 
grinding and befuddling to just about 
everyone, but we don’t fix it. In fact, it 
seems to get worse each time, not bet-
ter. I know I would prefer not to go 
through the process again, but the In-
flation Reduction Act and the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan before it have been 
worth it. 
Dahlia Rockowitz, Washington direc-
tor of Dayenu: A Jewish Call to Cli-
mate Action, noted that the Senate 
consideration of the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act began on the Shabbat and 
Tisha B’Av, a Jewish day of collective 
mourning for historic destructions. But 
as she pointed out, ‘‘ . . . according to 
Jewish tradition, this day of despair is 
also the day that new hope and the po-
tential of a rebuilt, reimagined, re-
deemed world is born. These invest-
ments in clean energy and transpor-
tation can help us emerge from cli-
mate-fueled disasters to a more hope-
ful, clean energy future for generations 
to come.’’ 
f 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 
2022 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to enter into a colloquy 
with the chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, Senator WYDEN, to discuss sec-
tions 13701 and 13702 of the Inflation 
Reduction Act. These sections estab-
lish new sections 45Y and 48D of the 
Tax Code that provide new tax credits 
for, respectively, production from and 
investment in clean electricity re-
sources that are placed in service after 
December 31, 2024. 
Mr. WYDEN. I am pleased to join the 
senior Senator from Nevada in this col-
loquy today to discuss sections 13701 
and 13702 of the Inflation Reduction 
Act. These sections of the Inflation Re-
duction Act reflect the work of a vari-
ety of Members, but few Members have 
been as focused on geothermal energy 
than the Silver State’s senior Senator. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. As the chair-
man of the Finance Committee knows 
well, the Inflation Reduction Act in-
cludes new and improved clean energy 
tax credits, and I commend Senator 
WYDEN for leading the effort to sim-
plify the Tax Code’s incentives for 
clean electricity. These credits will ad-
vance our transition to a clean energy 
future and are a key part of this legis-
lation’s goal of reducing carbon emis-
sions from the electricity sector more 
than 40 percent by 2030. 
The 45Y and 48D provisions expressly 
make geothermal energy eligible for 
critical tax credits, and I appreciate 
the chairman’s attention to this issue 
given its importance to Nevada’s econ-
omy. Nevada is a leader in geothermal 
energy and the industry provides crit-
ical jobs and revenues for my State and 
others across the country. Geothermal 
resources also provide clean power, and 
they are essential to meet the emis-
sions reduction goals of this legisla-
tion. As the current chairman of the 
Finance Committee and former chair-
man of the Energy and Natural Re-
sources 
Committee, 
can 
Senator 
WYDEN comment how this legislation 
intends to spur the deployment of this 
critical clean energy technology? 
Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the ques-
tion. For those unfamiliar with geo-
thermal energy, it is generally pro-
duced by delivering geothermal brine 
and steam from underground reservoirs 
to the surface, where the resource then 
runs turbines to generate electricity. 
In some cases, there is a de minimis of 
amount of naturally occurring non-
combustion emissions released in the 
renewable generating process and the 
electricity 
produced 
is 
considered 
emissions free. 
Thanks in part to the relentless ef-
forts from Senator CORTEZ MASTO, the 
Inflation Reduction Act provides the 
same incentives for geothermal energy 
resources placed in service after De-
cember 31, 2024, as it does for elec-
tricity produced by solar, wind, and 
other renewable resources. Indeed, all 
geothermal energy is included among 
the resources meeting the definition of 
‘‘qualified facility’’ for the purposes of 
the new sections 45Y and 48D included 
in the Inflation Reduction Act. 
I thank my colleague from Nevada 
for her dedication to and leadership on 
geothermal energy incentives. I am 
pleased to have worked with her on 
these incentives, and I most certainly 
agree that electricity produced from 
geothermal resources property quali-
fies for the production and investment 
incentives provided by sections 13701 
and 13702 of the Inflation Reduction 
Act. That has been my intent through-
out the course of drafting this legisla-
tion. Geothermal resources are critical 
to our clean energy future, and I thank 
my colleague for her collaboration in 
developing these robust new tax credits 
for clean energy. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I thank the 
chairman of the Finance Committee 
and my friend from Oregon for his com-
prehensive answer, his commitment to 
solving for climate change, and for 
joining me today in this colloquy.

TRIBUTE TO KIM BRINKMAN 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate Kim Brinkman, who will 
be retiring on August 11, and to thank 
her for her 34-plus years of exemplary 
service to the Senate community. Kim 
has spent her entire career working in 
the Senate Disbursing Office. Her col-
leagues in disbursing will miss her, but 
so, too, will all Senators and Senate 
staff and their families. We have all re-
lied on Kim for expert advice and guid-
ance on pay and health and retirement 
benefits and other issues.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4213 
August 6, 2022 
Kim is a constituent, but she origi-
nally hails from Nevada, IA. She at-
tended Stephens College in Columbia, 
MO, for 2 years and then transferred to 
the University of Iowa, where she grad-
uated with a degree in economics. She 
is a proud Hawkeye. 
In 1985, Kim had a summer internship 
working at the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration and decided she wanted to 
return to Washington, DC, after she 
graduated from college. She went to a 
library 
in 
nearby 
Ames, 
IA, 
and 
checked the ‘‘Help Wanted’’ section of 
the Washington Post’s classifieds. The 
Senate Disbursing Office had an open-
ing; she applied and returned to Wash-
ington to interview for the job; and she 
got it. She started working in the dis-
bursing office on October 5, 1987. 
When Kim started her career, the dis-
bursing office had a staff of 43; just 10 
of them were women, including Kim. 
The Senate had just two female Sen-
ators: Senator Nancy Kassebaum of 
Kansas, and my former colleague, Sen-
ator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, 
who had just assumed office a few 
months before Kim arrived. Fast for-
ward to today, and 45 of the disbursing 
office’s 58 staffers are women. There 
are 24 female Senators, plus Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS. That has been one of the 
biggest changes Kim has witnessed 
over the course of her career. The other 
is the advent of the internet, email, 
and 
other 
information 
technology, 
which has revolutionized the way we 
all work, including Kim. 
Senators 
LEAHY, 
GRASSLEY, 
McCONNELL, and SHELBY are the only 
Members currently serving who arrived 
here before Kim, and just one of her 
colleagues at disbursing has more se-
niority. Kim began her career as a staff 
assistant in the front office, moved to 
the employee benefits section, became 
the employee benefits manager, and 
later was promoted to her current posi-
tion as assistant financial clerk of the 
Senate. 
I have often said that the Senate is a 
family, and we are so grateful to staff 
members like Kim who make it func-
tion. Certainly, Kim has made the 
thousands of Senators and staffers she 
has helped over the years feel like fam-
ily. She isn’t just a subject matter ex-
pert when it comes to pay and benefits; 
she is friendly, cheerful, patient, and 
kind. Everyone who knows Kim has the 
highest regard and affection for her. 
Kim will travel back to Iowa this 
month to visit her parents and help 
celebrate her father’s 90th birthday. 
She will also travel to Kentucky to cel-
ebrate her daughter Maya’s graduation 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Kentucky. 
While Kim and her sister will continue 
to look after their parents as needed, I 
know Kim’s legions of friends in the DC 
metropolitan area are glad that she 
will be coming back here, where she 
will step up her gardening and her an-
tique shopping in Rappahannock Coun-
ty. She will have more time for her art-
work and playing the piano and clari-
net and volunteering at her church, 
where she is part of the visiting min-
istry team. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ‘‘To 
laugh often and much; To win the re-
spect of intelligent people and the af-
fection of children; To earn the appre-
ciation of honest critics and endure the 
betrayal of false friends; To appreciate 
beauty, to find the best in others; To 
leave the world a bit better, whether 
by a healthy child, a garden patch, or 
a redeemed social condition; To know 
even one life has breathed easier be-
cause you have lived. This is to have 
succeeded.’’ He was describing Kim 
Brinkman. 
On behalf of my colleagues, but espe-
cially on behalf of all the Senate staff-
ers and their family members whom 
she has counseled and assisted over the 
years, I want to thank Kim for her out-
standing service and wish her all the 
best as she embarks on the next chap-
ter in a life well lived.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL LAURIE RODRIGUEZ 
Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor an exceptional 
member of the Air National Guard. I 
would like to recognize Lt. Col. Laurie 
Rodriguez’s distinguished service and 
dedication to enhancing the relation-
ship between the National Guard and 
my office as a legislative liaison. 
A native of Brandon, SD, Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Rodriguez 
enlisted 
in 
the 
South Dakota Air National Guard and 
was later commissioned as a force sup-
port officer. She has served 25 years in 
both the South Dakota and Mississippi 
National Guard in a broad range of 
drill status and Active-Duty assign-
ments, including a deployment to Af-
ghanistan in support of Operation En-
during Freedom. Currently, she is ex-
celling in not one, but two, demanding 
positions as the 186th Force Support 
Squadron commander and as the joint 
team lead for the National Guard Bu-
reau Office of Legislative Liaison. Ad-
ditionally, she has served Active-Duty 
tours at Headquarters Air Force, the 
Executive Office of the President’s Of-
fice of National Drug Control Policy, 
and several offices within the National 
Guard Bureau. 
Lieutenant Colonel Rodriguez has 
served as a legislative liaison officer 
since October of 2018. Her attention to 
detail and responsiveness strengthened 
the relationship between my office and 
the National Guard immeasurably. Ad-
ditionally, she formulated the congres-
sional engagement plan and prepared 
National Guard leadership for over 71 
meetings and hearings, informing con-
gressional members on the National 
Guard Bureau’s legislative priorities. 
Her efforts played a pivotal role in se-
curing $129 million in appropriations in 
support of counter drug operations 
helping deter the opioid epidemic. Lau-
rie also served as lead action officer on 
the impacts the creation of the Space 
Force had on 13 National Guard units 
with space missions. Finally, she an-
swered hundreds of congressional in-
quiries, which provided critical infor-
mation necessary for the consideration 
of three National Defense Authoriza-
tion Acts. She did all of this while tak-
ing care of the men and women under 
her command at the 186th Force Sup-
port Squadron. 
After concluding this challenging as-
signment in August, Lieutenant Colo-
nel Rodriguez will take on another 
challenging role as a deputy division 
chief within the National Guard Bu-
reau Operations Directorate. She em-
bodies the qualities that the Nation ex-
pects from our officer corps and has a 
promising career ahead in continued 
service to our Nation. In closing, I ex-
press my gratitude and appreciation to 
Lieutenant Colonel Rodriguez for her 
excellent support of my office in fur-
therance of National Guard missions 
and my appreciation to her supportive 
husband, Angello Rodriguez. I wish this 
National Guard family all the best in 
their next chapter of service to our Na-
tion.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF MILE HIGH 
EARLY LEARNING 
∑ Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Mile High Early 
Learning for 50 years of service in sup-
port of children and families in Colo-
rado. 
Mile High Early Learning is Denver’s 
largest and oldest provider of sub-
sidized high quality early care and edu-
cation and is celebrating its 50th anni-
versary in 2022. Since the organiza-
tion’s founding, Mile High Early Learn-
ing has provided high quality early 
care and education to more than 50,000 
children. 
Mile High Early Learning had its be-
ginnings when community child care 
providers created a consortium, incor-
porated on January 19, 1972, to provide 
affordable, 
accessible 
quality 
early 
childhood education and care for chil-
dren from working families with lim-
ited resources. Today, Mile High Early 
Learning serves more than 1,500 young 
children every year. 
As a Head Start and Early Head 
Start provider, Mile High Early Learn-
ing leverages these Federal resources 
to partner with numerous local early 
childhood 
providers 
to 
offer 
com-
prehensive health and family support 
services to families and expand access 
to high quality early education and 
care across Colorado. 
Mile High Early Learning incor-
porates 
cutting-edge 
knowledge 
in 
early childhood, using a Montessori in-
spired approach that supports a love of 
learning, 
social-emotional 
develop-
ment, and critical skills that lead to 
lifelong success. 
As a leader in the field of early child-
hood, Mile High Early Learning has de-
veloped continuing education and pro-
fessional learning programs designed

to grow, strengthen, and sustain our 
early childhood workforce including 
family, friend, and neighbor caregivers 
who care for the majority of children 
under age 3 years. Mile High Early 
Learning has created a workforce pipe-
line with on-ramps through its profes-
sional learning center that includes a 
child development associate training 
program for teachers who are begin-
ning their profession in early child-
hood. 
Mile High Early Learning’s quality 
programming informs state and na-
tional leaders and continues to be at 
the forefront in advocating for children 
and families across Colorado and pro-
moting systems-level impacts that sup-
port and improve the field of early 
childhood education. 
Mile High Early Learning is guided 
by a mission to enable all children to 
succeed in school by providing re-
sources and education to inspire a life-
time of learning and a vision that all 
are joyfully welcomed into a learning 
community that prioritizes equity. 
I 
congratulate 
Mile 
High 
Early 
Learning on reaching this important 
milestone of 50 years of caring for our 
children 
and 
ensuring 
high-quality 
early care and education.∑

THE ATTACK 
Ms. BALDWIN (for herself and Mr. 
JOHNSON) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 749 
Whereas the freedom of religion is pro-
tected in the Constitution, and no religious 
institution should be subject to violence, 
hate, intolerance, or religious and racial dis-
crimination; 
Whereas, on Sunday, August 5, 2012, a

death of 7 worshipers who were at the Sikh

Creek, Wisconsin; 
Whereas the attack occurred as members 
of the congregation prepared a free commu-
nity meal served to all congregants arriving

senseless act of violence and tragedy that 
should never befall any house of worship; 
Whereas the Sikh community responded to

lentless optimism’’;

come stronger than before: Now, therefore,

AND THE DEDICATION OF THE

WAR 
VETERANS 
MEMORIAL ON JULY 27, 2022 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself and Ms. 
DUCKWORTH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 750 
Whereas, formed with the signing of the 
Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United 
States and the Republic of Korea, done at 
Washington October 1, 1953, the United 
States-Republic of Korea alliance is the 
linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity 
for Northeast Asia, a free and open Indo-Pa-
cific region, and across the world; 
Whereas United States-Republic of Korea 
military and defense ties are unwavering, 
and our ever-increasing economic, techno-
logical, diplomatic, people-to-people, and 
values-based bonds are strong and enduring; 
Whereas the United States commitment to 
the defense of the Republic of Korea remains 
ironclad, and the alliance continues to work 
toward our shared goals of securing peace, 
stability, and prosperity on the Korean Pe-
ninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific; 
Whereas the Wall of Remembrance at the 
Korean War Veterans Memorial was dedi-
cated on July 27, 2022, with the names of 
more than 36,600 members of the United 
States Armed Forces who lost their lives in 
the Korea conflict, along with more than 
7,100 Korean Augmentation to the United 
States Army personnel who died serving 
alongside them; 
Whereas the names of the United States 
and Republic of Korean fallen are integrated 
to reflect the shared burden they bore to de-
fend the Republic of Korea; and 
Whereas the Republic of Korea and its citi-
zens funded nearly the entire $22,000,000 cost 
of building the Wall of Remembrance: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate deeply appre-
ciates and sincerely thanks the Government 
and people of the Republic of Korea for their 
generosity in funding the Wall of Remem-
brance, reflecting the shared sacrifice and 
common values of the United States-Repub-
lic of Korea alliance.

(c) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 1561

follows: 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The component mem-
bers of a controlled group of corporations on 
a December 31 shall, for their taxable years 
which include such December 31, be limited 
for purposes of this subtitle to— 
‘‘(1) amounts in each taxable income 
bracket in the subparagraphs of section 
11(b)(1) which do not aggregate more than 
the maximum amount in each such bracket 
to which a corporation which is not a compo-
nent member of a controlled group is enti-
tled, and 
‘‘(2) one $250,000 ($150,000 if any component 
member is a corporation described in section 
535(c)(2)(B)) amount for purposes of com-
puting the accumulated earnings credit 
under section 535(c)(2) and (3). 
The amounts specified in paragraph (1) shall 
be divided equally among the component 
members of such group on such December 31 
unless all of such component members con-
sent (at such time and in such manner as the 
Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) to 
an apportionment plan providing for an un-
equal allocation of such amounts. The 
amounts specified in paragraph (2) shall be 
divided equally among the component mem-
bers of such group on such December 31 un-
less the Secretary prescribes regulations per-
mitting 
an 
unequal 
allocation 
of 
such 
amounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in 
applying the last sentence of section 11(b)(1) 
to such component members, the taxable in-
come of all such component members shall 
be taken into account and any increase in 
tax under such last sentence shall be divided 
among such component members in the same 
manner as amounts under paragraph (1).’’, 
and 
(2) by striking ‘‘ACCUMULATED
EARNINGS 
CREDIT’’ in the heading and inserting ‘‘CER-
TAIN MULTIPLE TAX BENEFITS’’. 
(d) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall apply to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
(e) NORMALIZATION REQUIREMENTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—A normalization method 
of accounting shall not be treated as being 
used with respect to any public utility prop-
erty for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the tax-
payer, in computing its cost of service for 
ratemaking purposes and reflecting oper-
ating results in its regulated books of ac-
count, reduces the tax reserve deficit less 
rapidly or to a lesser extent than such re-
serve would be reduced under the average 
rate assumption method. 
(2) ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CERTAIN TAX-
PAYERS.—If, as of the first day of the taxable 
year that includes the date of enactment of 
this Act— 
(A) the taxpayer was required by a regu-
latory agency to compute depreciation for 
public utility property on the basis of an av-
erage life or composite rate method, and 
(B) the taxpayer’s books and underlying 
records did not contain the vintage account 
data necessary to apply the average rate as-
sumption method, 
the taxpayer will be treated as using a nor-
malization method of accounting if, with re-
spect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer uses 
the alternative method for public utility 
property that is subject to the regulatory 
authority of that jurisdiction. 
(3) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this sub-
section— 
(A) TAX RESERVE DEFICIT.—The term ‘‘tax 
reserve deficit’’ means the excess of— 
(i) the amount which would be the balance 
in the reserve for deferred taxes (as described 
in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986, or section 167(l)(3)(G)(ii) of 
such Code as in effect on the day before the 
date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986) if the amount of such reserve were 
determined by assuming that the corporate 
rate increases provided in the amendments 
made by this section were in effect for all 
prior periods, over 
(ii) the balance in such reserve as of the 
day before such corporate rate increases 
take effect. 
(B) AVERAGE RATE ASSUMPTION METHOD.— 
The average rate assumption method is the 
method under which the excess in the re-
serve for deferred taxes is reduced over the 
remaining lives of the property as used in its 
regulated books of account which gave rise 
to the reserve for deferred taxes. Under such 
method, if timing differences for the prop-
erty reverse, the amount of the adjustment 
to the reserve for the deferred taxes is cal-
culated by multiplying— 
(i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes 
for the property to the aggregate timing dif-
ferences for the property as of the beginning 
of the period in question, by 
(ii) the amount of the timing differences 
which reverse during such period. 
(C) 
ALTERNATIVE
METHOD.—The 
‘‘alter-
native method’’ is the method in which the 
taxpayer— 
(i) computes the tax reserve deficit on all 
public utility property included in the plant 
account on the basis of the weighted average 
life or composite rate used to compute depre-
ciation for regulatory purposes, and 
(ii) reduces the tax reserve deficit ratably 
over the remaining regulatory life of the 
property. 
(4) TREATMENT
OF
NORMALIZATION
VIOLA-
TION.—If, for any taxable year ending after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
taxpayer does not use a normalization meth-
od of accounting, such taxpayer shall not be 
treated as using a normalization method of 
accounting for purposes of subsections (f)(2) 
and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986. 
(5) REGULATIONS.—The Secretary of the 
Treasury, or the Secretary’s designee, shall 
issue such regulations or other guidance as 
may be necessary or appropriate to carry out 
this subsection, including regulations or 
other guidance to provide appropriate co-
ordination between this subsection, section 
13001(d) of Public Law 115-97, and section 
203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

model’) developed by Argonne National Lab-
oratory, or a successor model (as determined 
by the Secretary). 
‘‘(2) QUALIFIED CLEAN HYDROGEN.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The term ‘qualified 
clean hydrogen’ means hydrogen which is 
produced through a process that results in a 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate of 
not greater than 4 kilograms of CO2e per 
kilogram of hydrogen.

to the quotient of— 
‘‘(I) an amount equal to— 
‘‘(aa) 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, 
minus 
‘‘(bb) the emissions rate for such fuel, di-
vided by 
‘‘(II) 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. 
‘‘(B) ESTABLISHMENT OF EMISSIONS RATE.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to clauses (ii) 
and (iii), the Secretary shall annually pub-
lish a table which sets forth the emissions 
rate for similar types and categories of 
transportation fuels based on the amount of 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (as de-
scribed in section 211(o)(1)(H) of the Clean 
Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(H)), as in effect 
on the date of the enactment of this section) 
for such fuels, expressed as kilograms of 
CO2e per mmBTU, which a taxpayer shall use 
for purposes of this section. 
‘‘(ii) NON-AVIATION
FUEL.—In the case of 
any transportation fuel which is not a sus-
tainable aviation fuel, the lifecycle green-
house gas emissions of such fuel shall be 
based on the most recent determinations 
under 
the 
Greenhouse 
gases, 
Regulated 
Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation 
model developed by Argonne National Lab-
oratory, or a successor model (as determined 
by the Secretary). 
‘‘(iii) AVIATION FUEL.—In the case of any 
transportation fuel which is a sustainable 
aviation fuel, the lifecycle greenhouse gas 
emissions of such fuel shall be determined in 
accordance with— 
‘‘(I) the most recent Carbon Offsetting and 
Reduction Scheme for International Avia-
tion which has been adopted by the Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization with 
the agreement of the United States, or 
‘‘(II) any similar methodology which satis-
fies the criteria under section 211(o)(1)(H) of 
the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(H)), as 
in effect on the date of enactment of this 
section.

Secretary may round the emissions rates 
under subparagraph (B) to the nearest mul-
tiple of 5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—In the case of an emis-
sions rate that is between 2.5 kilograms of 
CO2e per mmBTU and -2.5 kilograms of CO2e 
per mmBTU, the Secretary may round such 
rate to zero. 
‘‘(D) PROVISIONAL EMISSIONS RATE.—In the 
case of any transportation fuel for which an 
emissions rate has not been established 
under subparagraph (B), a taxpayer pro-
ducing such fuel may file a petition with the 
Secretary for determination of the emissions 
rate with respect to such fuel.

adjusted 
by 
multiplying 
such 
amount by the inflation adjustment factor 
for the calendar year in which the sale of the 
transportation fuel occurs. If any amount as 
increased under the preceding sentence is 
not a multiple of 1 cent, such amount shall 
be rounded to the nearest multiple of 1 cent.

paragraph (3). A State shall reduce or in-
crease the amounts provided under such sub-
grants or contracts if needed to adjust for 
any overpayment or underpayment described 
in subsection (c)(2)(B)(iv). 
(B) 
AMOUNT.—A 
State 
shall 
award 
a 
subgrant or contract under this subsection 
in a sufficient amount to enable the eligible 
provider to operate a local preschool pro-
gram that meets the requirements of sub-
section (c)(5)(B), which amount shall reflect 
variations in the cost of preschool services

PRESCHOOL
PROGRAMS
IN
HIGH-NEED

first prioritize establishing and expanding 
universal local preschool programs within 
and across high-need communities by award-
ing subgrants or contracts to eligible pro-
viders operating within and across, or with 
capacity to operate within and across, such 
high-need communities. The State shall— 
(i) use a research-based methodology ap-
proved by the Secretary to identify such 
high-need communities, as determined by— 
(I) the rate of poverty in the community; 
(II) rates of access to high-quality pre-
school within the community; and 
(III) other indicators of community need as 
required by the Secretary; and 
(ii) distribute funding for preschool serv-
ices under this section within such a high- 
need community so that a majority of chil-
dren in the community are offered such pre-
school services before the State establishes 
and expands preschool services in commu-
nities with lower levels of need. 
(B) USE OF FUNDS.—Subgrants or contracts 
awarded under subparagraph (A) shall be 
used to enroll and serve children in such a 
local preschool program involved, including 
by paying the costs— 
(i) of personnel (including classroom and 
administrative personnel), including com-
pensation and benefits; 
(ii) associated with implementing the 
State’s preschool standards, providing cur-
riculum supports, and meeting early learn-
ing and development standards; 
(iii) of professional development, teacher 
supports, and training; 
(iv) of implementing and meeting develop-
mentally appropriate health and safety 
standards (including licensure, where appli-
cable), teacher to child ratios, and group size 
maximums; 
(v) of materials, equipment, and supplies; 
and 
(vi) of rent or a mortgage, utilities, build-
ing security, indoor and outdoor mainte-
nance, and insurance. 
(4) ESTABLISHING AND EXPANDING UNIVERSAL 
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IN ADDITIONAL COMMU-
NITIES.—Once a State that receives a pay-
ment under subsection (c)(2) meets the re-
quirements of paragraph (3) with respect to 
establishing and expanding local preschool 
programs within and across high-need com-
munities, the State shall use funds from 
such payment to enroll and serve children in 
local preschool programs, as described in 
such paragraph, in additional communities 
in accordance with the metrics described in 
paragraph (3)(A)(i). Such funds shall be used 
for the activities described in clauses (i)

other private organizations, or a combina-
tion of such sources and contributions; and 
(5) shall count not more than 100 percent of 
the State’s current spending on prekinder-
garten programs, calculated as the average 
amount of such spending by the State for fis-
cal years 2020, 2021, and 2022, toward the 
State’s non-Federal share. 
(h) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—If a State reduces its com-
bined fiscal effort per child for the State pre-
school program (whether a publicly funded 
preschool program or a program under this 
section) or through State supplemental as-
sistance funds for Head Start programs as-
sisted under the Head Start Act, or through 
any State spending on preschool services for 
any fiscal year that a State receives pay-
ments under subsection (c)(2) (referred to in 
this paragraph as the ‘‘reduction fiscal 
year’’) relative to the previous fiscal year, 
the Secretary, in collaboration with the Sec-
retary of Education, shall reduce support for 
such State under such subsection by the 
same amount as the total reduction in that 
State fiscal effort for such reduction fiscal 
year. 
(2) WAIVER.—The Secretary, in collabora-
tion with the Secretary of Education, may 
waive the requirements of paragraph (1) if— 
(A) the Secretaries determine that a waiv-
er would be appropriate due to a precipitous 
decline in the financial resources of a State 
as a result of unforeseen economic hardship, 
or a natural disaster, that has necessitated 
across-the-board reductions in State services 
during the 5-year period preceding the date 
of the determination, including for early 
childhood education programs; or 
(B) due to the circumstance of a State re-
quiring reductions in specific programs, in-
cluding early childhood education programs, 
the State presents to the Secretaries a jus-
tification and demonstration why other pro-
grams could not be reduced and how early 
childhood education programs in the State 
will not be disproportionately harmed by 
such State reductions. 
(i) SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT.—Funds re-
ceived under this section shall be used to 
supplement and not supplant other Federal, 
State, and local public funds expended on 
prekindergarten programs in the State on 
the date of enactment of this Act, calculated 
as the average amount of such Federal, 
State, and local public funds expended for 
fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

section (c)(7).

(A) receiving, processing, and determining 
the validity of complaints or findings con-
cerning any failure of a State to comply with 
the State plan or any other requirement of 
this section; 
(B) notifying a State when the Secretary 
has determined there has been a failure by 
the State to comply with a requirement of 
this section; and 
(C) imposing sanctions under this sub-
section for such a failure.

ing, prohibitions, or other authorization re-
quirements outside of the Program; 
(ii) each covered provision that the appli-
cant seeks to have waived during participa-
tion in the Program; 
(iii) how the good, service, or project would 
benefit consumers; 
(iv) what likely risks the participation of 
the applicant in the Program may pose, and 
how the applicant intends to reasonably 
mitigate those risks; 
(v) how participation in the Program 
would render the offering of the good, serv-
ice, or project successful; 
(vi) a description of the plan and estimated 
time periods for the beginning and end of the 
offering of the good, service, or project under 
the Program; 
(vii) a recognition that the applicant will 
be subject to all laws and rules after the con-
clusion of the offering of the good, service, or 
project under the Program; 
(viii) how the applicant will end the dem-
onstration of the offering of the good, serv-
ice, or project under the Program; 
(ix) how the applicant will repair harm to 
consumers if the offering of the good, serv-
ice, or project under the Program fails; and

quired by the Office. 
(2) ASSISTANCE.—The Office may, upon re-
quest, provide assistance to an applicant to 
complete the application process for a waiv-
er under the Program, including by pro-
viding the likely covered provisions that 
could be eligible for such a waiver. 
(3) AGENCY REVIEW.— 
(A) TRANSMISSION.—Not later than 14 days 
after the date on which the Office receives an 
application under paragraph (1), the Office 
shall submit a copy of the application to 
each applicable agency.

agency, or a designee thereof, shall review a 
Program application received under subpara-
graph (A) with input from the advisory board 
established under section 70008(b)(2).

of an application submitted to an applicable 
agency under subparagraph (A), the head of 
the applicable agency, or a designee thereof, 
with input from the advisory board of the ap-
plicable agency established under section 
70008(b)(2), shall consider whether— 
(i) the plan of the applicant to deploy their 
offering will adequately protect consumers 
from harm; 
(ii) the likely health and safety risks, risks 
that are likely to cause economic damage, 
and the likelihood for unfair or deceptive 
practices to be committed against con-
sumers are outweighed by the potential ben-
efits to consumers from the offering of the 
applicant; and 
(iii) it is possible to provide the applicant 
a waiver even if the Office does not waive 
every covered provision requested by the ap-
plicant. 
(D) FINAL DECISION.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to clause (ii), the 
head of an applicable agency, or a designee 
thereof, who receives a copy of an applica-
tion under subparagraph (A) shall, with the 
consideration of the recommendations of the 
advisory board of the applicable agency es-
tablished under section 70008(b)(2), make the 
final decision to grant or deny the applica-
tion. 
(ii) IN PART APPROVAL.— 
(I) IN GENERAL.—If more than 1 applicable 
agency receives a copy of an application 
under subparagraph (A)— 
(aa) the head of each applicable agency (or 
their designees), with input from the advi-
sory board of the applicable agency estab-
lished under section 70008(b)(2), shall grant 
or deny the waiver of the covered provisions 
over which the applicable agency has juris-
diction for enforcement or implementation; 
and 
(bb) if each applicable agency that receives 
an 
application 
under 
subparagraph 
(A) 
grants the waiver under item (aa), the Direc-
tor shall grant the entire application. 
(II) IN PART APPROVAL BY DIRECTOR.—If an 
applicable agency denies part of an applica-
tion under subclause (I) but another applica-
ble agency grants part of the application, the 
Director shall approve the application in 
part and specify in the final decision which 
covered provisions are waived. 
(E) RECORD OF DECISION.— 
(i) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after receiving a copy of an application 
under subparagraph (A), an applicable agen-
cy shall approve or deny the application and 
submit to the Director a record of the deci-
sion, which shall include a description of 
each likely health and safety risk, each risk 
that is likely to cause economic damage, and 
the likelihood for unfair or deceptive prac-
tices to be committed against consumers 
that the covered provision the applicant is 
seeking to have waived protects against, 
and— 
(I) if the application is approved, a descrip-
tion of how the identifiable, significant 
harms will be mitigated and how consumers 
will be protected under the waiver; 
(II) if the applicable agency denies the 
waiver, a description of the reasons for the 
decision, including why a waiver would like-
ly cause health and safety risks, likely cause 
economic damage, and increase the likeli-
hood for unfair or deceptive practices to be 
committed against consumers, and the like-
lihood of such risks occurring, as well as rea-
sons why the application cannot be approved 
in part or reformed to mitigate such risks; 
and 
(III) if the applicable agency determines 
that a waiver would likely cause health and 
safety risks, likely cause economic damage, 
and there is likelihood for unfair or decep-
tive practices to be committed against con-
sumers as a result of the covered provision 
that an applicant is requesting to have 
waived, but the applicable agency deter-
mines such risks can be protected through 
less restrictive means than denying the ap-
plication, the applicable agency shall pro-
vide a recommendation of how that can be 
achieved. 
(ii) NO RECORD SUBMITTED.—If the applica-
ble agency does not submit a record of the 
decision with respect to an application for a 
waiver submitted to the applicable agency,

SEC. 11104. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING 
THE NEED TO EXPAND COMMER-
CIALLY AVAILABLE DRUG PRICING 
COMPARISON PLATFORMS. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) commercially available drug pricing 
comparison platforms can, at no cost, help 
patients find the lowest price for their medi-
cations at their local pharmacy; 
(2) such platforms should be integrated, to 
the maximum extent possible, in the health 
care delivery ecosystem; and 
(3) pharmacy benefit managers should 
work to disclose generic and brand name 
drug prices to such platforms to ensure 
that— 
(A) patients can benefit from the lowest 
possible price available to them; and 
(B) overall drug prices can be reduced as 
more educated purchasing decisions are 
made based on price transparency.

nitude of bona fide service fees has grown 
over time and how such growth compares to

described in subparagraph (B) for one or 
more quarters beginning on or after January

capacity of all manufacturers with an ap-
proved application for such drug or biologi-
cal that is currently marketed or total num-

cation for such drug or biological that is cur-
rently marketed declines during a 6-month 
period, as determined by the Secretary.

OF
ADDITIONAL
INFORMA-
TION.—For each quarter in which the amount 
of payment for a drug or biological described

icaid Services that is accessible to the public 
a report of the most recently available data 
on patterns related to prescriptions filled by

(b) CONTENT OF REPORT.— 
(1) REQUIRED
CONTENT.—Each report re-
quired under subsection (a) for a calendar

Northern Mariana Islands, and American 
Samoa): 
(A) A comparison of covered outpatient 
drug (as defined in section 1927(k)(2) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r–8(k)(2))) 
prescribing patterns under the State Med-
icaid plan or waiver of such plan (including

greatest share of total spending under the 
plan or waiver during the year that is the 
subject of the report; 
(II) procedural groupings; and 
(III) rare disease diagnosis codes (except 
where the inclusion of such information 
would jeopardize the privacy of an indi-
vidual, as determined by the Secretary); 
(iv) by patient demographic characteris-
tics, including race (to the extent that the 
Secretary determines that there is sufficient 
data available with respect to such char-
acteristic in a majority of States and that 
inclusion of such characteristic would not 
jeopardize the privacy of the individual), 
gender, and age; 
(v) by patient high-utilizer or risk status; 
and 
(vi) by high and low resource settings by 
facility and place of service categories, as

covered outpatient drugs (as so defined) pro-
vided under a State Medicaid plan or waiver 
of such plan in a managed care setting, an 
analysis of the differences in managed care 
prescribing patterns when a covered out-
patient drug is prescribed in a managed care 
setting as compared to when the drug is pre-
scribed in a fee-for-service setting. 
(2) ADDITIONAL
CONTENT.—To the extent 
available, a report required under subsection

SEC. 14308. RISK-SHARING VALUE-BASED PAY-
MENT AGREEMENTS FOR COVERED 
OUTPATIENT DRUGS UNDER MED-
ICAID. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1927 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r–8) is amended 
by adding at the end the following new sub-
section: 
‘‘(l) STATE OPTION TO PAY
FOR COVERED 
OUTPATIENT DRUGS THROUGH RISK-SHARING 
VALUE-BASED AGREEMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Beginning January 1, 
2024, a State shall have the option to pay 
(whether on a fee-for-service or managed 
care basis) for covered outpatient drugs that 
are potentially curative treatments intended 
for one-time use that are administered to in-
dividuals under this title by entering into a 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
with the manufacturer of the drug in accord-
ance with the requirements of this sub-
section. 
‘‘(2) SECRETARIAL APPROVAL.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A State shall submit a 
request to the Secretary to enter into a risk- 
sharing value-based payment agreement, and 
the Secretary shall not approve a proposed 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
between a State and a manufacturer for pay-
ment for a covered outpatient drug of the 
manufacturer unless the following require-
ments are met: 
‘‘(i) MANUFACTURER
HAS
IN
EFFECT
A
RE-
BATE AGREEMENT AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH 
ALL APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS.—The manu-
facturer has a rebate agreement in effect as 
required under subsections (a) and (b) of this 
section and is in compliance with all applica-
ble requirements under this title. 
‘‘(ii) NO EXPECTED INCREASE TO PROJECTED 
NET FEDERAL SPENDING.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—The Chief Actuary cer-
tifies that the projected payments for each 
covered outpatient drug under a proposed 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
is not expected to result in greater estimated 
Federal spending under this title than the 
net Federal spending that would result in 
the absence of such agreement. 
‘‘(II) NET FEDERAL SPENDING DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this subsection, the term ‘net 
Federal spending’ means the amount of Fed-
eral payments the Chief Actuary estimates 
would be made under this title for admin-
istering a covered outpatient drug to an indi-
vidual eligible for medical assistance under a 
State plan or a waiver of such plan, reduced 
by the amount of all rebates the Chief Actu-
ary estimates would be paid with respect to 
the administering of such drug, including all 
rebates under this title and any supple-
mental or other additional rebates, in the 
absence of such an agreement. 
‘‘(III) INFORMATION.—The Chief Actuary 
shall make the certifications required under 
this clause based on the most recently avail-
able and reliable drug pricing and product in-
formation. The State and manufacturer shall 
provide the Secretary and the Chief Actuary 
with all necessary information required to 
make the estimates needed for such certifi-
cations. 
‘‘(iii) LAUNCH
AND
LIST
PRICE
JUSTIFICA-
TIONS.—The manufacturer submits all rel-
evant information and supporting docu-
mentation necessary for pricing decisions as 
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, which 
shall be truthful and non-misleading, includ-
ing 
manufacturer 
information 
and 
sup-
porting documentation for launch price or 
list price increases, and any applicable jus-
tification required under section 1128L. 
‘‘(iv) CONFIDENTIALITY
OF
INFORMATION; 
PENALTIES.—The provisions of subparagraphs 
(C) and (D) of subsection (b)(3) shall apply to 
a manufacturer that fails to submit the in-
formation and documentation required under 
clauses (ii) and (iii) on a timely basis, or that 
knowingly provides false or misleading infor-
mation, in the same manner as such provi-
sions apply to a manufacturer with a rebate 
agreement under this section. 
‘‘(B) CONSIDERATION OF STATE REQUEST FOR 
APPROVAL.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall treat 
a State request for approval of a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement in the same 
manner that the Secretary treats a State 
plan amendment, and subpart B of part 430 of 
title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, includ-
ing, subject to clause (ii), the timing require-
ments of section 430.16 of such title (as in ef-
fect on the date of enactment of this sub-
section), shall apply to a request for ap-
proval of a risk-sharing value-based payment 
agreement in the same manner as such sub-
part applies to a State plan amendment. 
‘‘(ii) TIMING.—The Secretary shall consult 
with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs as 
required under subparagraph (C) and make a 
determination on whether to approve a re-
quest from a State for approval of a proposed 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
(or request additional information necessary 
to allow the Secretary to make a determina-
tion with respect to such request for ap-
proval) within the time period, to the extent 
practicable, specified in section 430.16 of title 
42, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect 
on the date of enactment of this subsection), 
but in no case shall the Secretary take more 
than 180 days after the receipt of such re-
quest for approval or response to such re-
quest for additional information to make 
such a determination (or request additional 
information). 
‘‘(C) CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSIONER 
OF FOOD AND DRUGS.—In considering whether 
to approve a risk-sharing value-based pay-
ment agreement, the Secretary, to the ex-
tent necessary, shall consult with the Com-
missioner of Food and Drugs to determine 
whether the relevant clinical parameters 
specified in such agreement are appropriate. 
‘‘(3) INSTALLMENT-BASED
PAYMENT
STRUC-
TURE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement shall provide for a 
payment structure under which, for every in-
stallment year of the agreement (subject to 
subparagraph (B)), the State shall pay the 
total installment year amount in equal in-
stallments to be paid at regular intervals 
over a period of time that shall be specified 
in the agreement. 
‘‘(B) REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLMENT PAY-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(i) TIMING OF FIRST PAYMENT.—The State 
shall make the first of the installment pay-
ments described in subparagraph (A) for an 
installment year not later than 30 days after 
the end of such year. 
‘‘(ii) LENGTH OF INSTALLMENT PERIOD.—The 
period of time over which the State shall 
make the installment payments described in 
subparagraph (A) for an installment year 
shall not be longer than 5 years. 
‘‘(iii) NONPAYMENT OR REDUCED PAYMENT OF 
INSTALLMENTS FOLLOWING A FAILURE TO MEET 
CLINICAL
PARAMETER.—If, prior to the pay-
ment date (as specified in the agreement) of 
any installment payment described in sub-
paragraph (A) or any other alternative date 
or time frame (as otherwise specified in the 
agreement), the covered outpatient drug 
which is subject to the agreement fails to 
meet a relevant clinical parameter of the 
agreement, the agreement shall provide 
that— 
‘‘(I) the installment payment shall not be 
made; or 
‘‘(II) the installment payment shall be re-
duced by a percentage specified in the agree-
ment that is based on the outcome achieved 
by the drug relative to the relevant clinical 
parameter. 
‘‘(4) NOTICE OF INTENT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), a manufacturer of a covered outpatient 
drug shall not be eligible to enter into a 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
under this subsection with respect to such 
drug unless the manufacturer notifies the 
Secretary that the manufacturer is inter-
ested in entering into such an agreement 
with respect to such drug. The decision to 
submit and timing of a request to enter into 
a proposed risk-sharing value-based payment 
agreement shall remain solely within the 
discretion of the State and shall only be ef-
fective upon Secretarial approval as required 
under this subsection. 
‘‘(B) TREATMENT
OF
SUBSEQUENTLY
AP-
PROVED DRUGS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a manufac-
turer of a covered outpatient drug des-
ignated under section 526 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, and ap-
proved under section 505 of such Act or li-
censed under subsection (a) or (k) of section 
351 of the Public Health Service Act after the

August 6, 2022 
date of enactment of this subsection, not 
more than 90 days after meeting with the 
Food and Drug Administration following 
phase II clinical trials for such drug (or, in 
the case of a drug described in clause (ii), not 
later than March 31, 2022), the manufacturer 
must notify the Secretary of the manufac-
turer’s intent to enter into a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement under this 
subsection with respect to such drug. If no 
such meeting has occurred, the Secretary 
may use discretion as to whether a poten-
tially curative treatment intended for one- 
time use may qualify for a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement under this 
section. A manufacturer notification of in-
terest shall not have any influence on a deci-
sion for drug approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
‘‘(ii) 
APPLICATION
TO
CERTAIN
SUBSE-
QUENTLY APPROVED DRUGS.—A drug described 
in this clause is a covered outpatient drug of 
a manufacturer— 
‘‘(I) that is approved under section 505 of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or 
licensed under section 351 of the Public 
Health Service Act after the date of enact-
ment of this subsection; and 
‘‘(II) with respect to which, as of January 
1, 2024, more than 90 days have passed after 
the manufacturer’s meeting with the Food 
and Drug Administration following phase II 
clinical trials for such drug. 
‘‘(iii) PARALLEL APPROVAL.—The Secretary, 
in coordination with the Administrator of 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
ices and the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs, shall, to the extent practicable, ap-
prove a State’s request to enter into a pro-
posed 
risk-sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agreement that otherwise meets the require-
ments of this subsection at the time that 
such a drug is approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration to help provide that no 
State that wishes to enter into such an 
agreement is required to pay for the drug in 
full at one time if the State is seeking to pay 
over a period of time as outlined in the pro-
posed agreement. 
‘‘(iv) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this paragraph shall be applied or construed 
to modify or affect the timeframes or factors 
involved in the Secretary’s determination of 
whether to approve or license a drug under 
section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act or section 351 of the Public 
Health Service Act. 
‘‘(5) SPECIAL PAYMENT RULES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise pro-
vided in this paragraph, with respect to an 
individual who is administered a unit of a 
covered outpatient drug that is reimbursed 
under a State plan by a State Medicaid agen-
cy under a risk-sharing value-based payment 
agreement in an installment year, the State 
shall remain liable to the manufacturer of 
such drug for payment for such unit without 
regard to whether the individual remains en-
rolled in the State plan under this title (or a 
waiver of such plan) for each installment 
year for which the State is to make install-
ment payments for covered outpatient drugs 
purchased under the agreement in such year. 
‘‘(B) DEATH.—In the case of an individual 
described in subparagraph (A) who dies dur-
ing the period described in such subpara-
graph, the State plan shall not be liable for 
any remaining payment for the unit of the 
covered outpatient drug administered to the 
individual which is owed under the agree-
ment described in such subparagraph. 
‘‘(C) WITHDRAWAL
OF
APPROVAL.—In the 
case of a covered outpatient drug that is the 
subject of a risk-sharing value-based pay-
ment agreement between a State and a man-
ufacturer under this subsection, including a 
drug approved in accordance with section 
506(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act, and such drug is the subject of an 
application that has been withdrawn by the 
Secretary, the State plan shall not be liable 
for any remaining payment that is owed 
under the agreement. 
‘‘(D) ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENT
UNDER 
AGREEMENT.—Subject to approval by the Sec-
retary, the terms of a proposed risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement submitted 
for approval by a State may provide that 
subparagraph (A) shall not apply. 
‘‘(E) GUIDANCE.—Not later than January 1, 
2024, the Secretary shall issue guidance to 
States establishing a process for States to 
notify the Secretary when an individual who 
is administered a unit of a covered out-
patient drug that is purchased by a State 
plan under a risk-sharing value-based pay-
ment agreement ceases to be enrolled under 
the State plan under this title (or a waiver of 
such plan) or dies before the end of the in-
stallment period applicable to such unit 
under the agreement. 
‘‘(6) TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS UNDER RISK- 
SHARING VALUE-BASED AGREEMENTS FOR PUR-
POSES
OF
AVERAGE
MANUFACTURER
PRICE; 
BEST PRICE.—The Secretary shall treat any 
payments made to the manufacturer of a 
covered outpatient drug under a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement under this 
subsection during a rebate period in the 
same manner that the Secretary treats pay-
ments made under a State supplemental re-
bate agreement under sections 447.504(c)(19) 
and 447.505(c)(7) of title 42, Code of Federal 
Regulations (or any successor regulations) 
for purposes of determining average manu-
facturer price and best price under this sec-
tion with respect to the covered outpatient 
drug and a rebate period and for purposes of 
offsets required under subsection (b)(1)(B). 
‘‘(7) ASSESSMENTS
AND
REPORT
TO
CON-
GRESS.— 
‘‘(A) ASSESSMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the end of each assessment period of 
any risk-sharing value-based payment agree-
ment for a State approved under this sub-
section, the Secretary shall conduct an eval-
uation of such agreement which shall include 
an evaluation by the Chief Actuary to deter-
mine whether program spending under the 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
aligned with the projections for the agree-
ment made under paragraph (2)(A)(ii), in-
cluding an assessment of whether actual 
Federal spending under this title under the 
agreement was less or more than net Federal 
spending would have been in the absence of 
the agreement. 
‘‘(ii) ASSESSMENT PERIOD.—For purposes of 
clause (i)— 
‘‘(I) the first assessment period for a risk- 
sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agreement 
shall be the period of time over which pay-
ments are scheduled to be made under the 
agreement for the first 10 individuals who 
are administered covered outpatient drugs 
under the agreement except that such period 
shall not exceed the 5-year period after the 
date on which the Secretary approves the 
agreement; and 
‘‘(II) each subsequent assessment period for 
a risk-sharing value-based payment agree-
ment shall be the 5-year period following the 
end of the previous assessment period. 
‘‘(B) RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) TERMINATION OPTION.—If the Secretary 
determines as a result of the assessment by 
the Chief Actuary under subparagraph (A) 
that the actual Federal spending under this 
title for any covered outpatient drug that 
was the subject of the State’s risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement was greater 
than the net Federal spending that would 
have resulted in the absence of the agree-
ment, the Secretary may terminate approval 
of such agreement and shall immediately 
conduct an assessment under this paragraph 
of any other ongoing risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement to which the same 
manufacturer is a party. 
‘‘(ii) REPAYMENT REQUIRED.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—If the Secretary deter-
mines as a result of the assessment by the 
Chief Actuary under subparagraph (A) that 
the Federal spending under the risk-sharing 
value-based agreement for a covered out-
patient drug that was subject to such agree-
ment was greater than the net Federal 
spending that would have resulted in the ab-
sence of the agreement, the manufacturer 
shall repay the difference to the State and 
Federal governments in a timely manner as 
determined by the Secretary. 
‘‘(II) TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO PAY.— 
The failure of a manufacturer to make re-
payments required under subclause (I) in a 
timely manner shall result in immediate ter-
mination of all risk-sharing value-based 
agreements to which the manufacturer is a 
party. 
‘‘(III) ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.—In the case 
of a manufacturer that fails to make repay-
ments required under subclause (I), the Sec-
retary may treat such manufacturer in the 
same manner as a manufacturer that fails to 
pay required rebates under this section, and 
the Secretary may— 
‘‘(aa) suspend or terminate the manufac-
turer’s rebate agreement under this section; 
and 
‘‘(bb) pursue any other remedy that would 
be available if the manufacturer had failed 
to pay required rebates under this section. 
‘‘(C) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 
5 years after the first risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement is approved under 
this subsection, the Secretary shall submit 
to Congress and make available to the public 
a report that includes— 
‘‘(i) an assessment of the impact of risk- 
sharing value-based payment agreements on 
access for individuals who are eligible for 
benefits under a State plan or waiver under 
this title to medically necessary covered 
outpatient drugs and related treatments; 
‘‘(ii) an analysis of the impact of such 
agreements on overall State and Federal 
spending under this title; 
‘‘(iii) an assessment of the impact of such 
agreements on drug prices, including launch 
price and price increases; and 
‘‘(iv) such recommendations to Congress as 
the Secretary deems appropriate. 
‘‘(8) GUIDANCE AND REGULATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than January 
1, 2024, the Secretary shall issue guidance to 
States seeking to enter into risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreements under this 
subsection that includes a model template 
for such agreements. The Secretary may 
issue any additional guidance or promulgate 
regulations as necessary to implement and 
enforce the provisions of this subsection. 
‘‘(B) MODEL AGREEMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If a State expresses an 
interest in pursuing a risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement under this sub-
section with a manufacturer for the purchase 
of a covered outpatient drug, the Secretary 
may share with such State any risk-sharing 
value-based agreement between a State and 
the manufacturer for the purchase of such 
drug that has been approved under this sub-
section. While such shared agreement may 
serve as a template for a State that wishes 
to propose, the use of a previously approved 
agreement shall not affect the submission 
and approval process for approval of a pro-
posed 
risk-sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agreement under this subsection, including 
the requirements under paragraph (2)(A). 
‘‘(ii) CONFIDENTIALITY.—In the case of a 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
that is disclosed to a State by the Secretary

under this subparagraph and that is only in 
effect with respect to a single State, the con-
fidentiality of information provisions de-
scribed in subsection (b)(3)(D) shall apply to 
such information. 
‘‘(C) OIG CONSULTATION.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall con-
sult with the Office of the Inspector General 
of the Department of Health and Human 
Services to determine whether there are po-
tential program integrity concerns (includ-
ing issues related to compliance with sec-
tions 1128B and 1877) with agreement approv-
als or templates and address accordingly. 
‘‘(ii) OIG POLICY UPDATES AS NECESSARY.— 
The Inspector General of the Department of 
Health and Human Services shall review and 
update, as necessary, any policies or guide-
lines of the Office of the Inspector General of 
the Department of Human Services (includ-
ing policies related to the enforcement of 
section 1128B) to accommodate the use of 
risk-sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agree-
ments in accordance with this section. 
‘‘(9) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
‘‘(A) MODIFICATIONS.—Nothing in this sub-
section or any regulations promulgated 
under this subsection shall prohibit a State 
from requesting a modification from the Sec-
retary to the terms of a risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement. A modification 
that is expected to result in any increase to 
projected net State or Federal spending 
under the agreement shall be subject to re-
certification by the Chief Actuary as de-
scribed in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) before the 
modification may be approved. 
‘‘(B) REBATE AGREEMENTS.—Nothing in this 
subsection shall be construed as requiring a 
State to enter into a risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement or as limiting or 
superseding the ability of a State to enter 
into a supplemental rebate agreement for a 
covered outpatient drug. 
‘‘(C) FFP FOR PAYMENTS UNDER RISK-SHAR-
ING
VALUE-BASED
PAYMENT
AGREEMENTS.— 
Federal financial participation shall be 
available under this title for any payment 
made by a State to a manufacturer for a cov-
ered outpatient drug under a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement in accord-
ance with this subsection, except that no 
Federal financial participation shall be

into contracting arrangements that use bona 
fide service fees, such as group purchasing 
organizations, wholesalers, providers, and 
pharmacies; 
(2) the various types of bona fide service 
fee contracting arrangements used by such 
entities; 
(3) the types of services that are paid for 
through such arrangements; 
(4) whether manufacturers define bona fide 
service fees differently across different enti-
ties; 
(5) how such arrangements are structured; 
(6) whether the structure or use of such ar-
rangements has changed over time; 
(7) the extent, if any, to which there is con-
sistency across manufacturers in what they 
consider to be a bona fide service fee as op-
posed to a discount or rebate that should be 
excluded from the determination of average 
sales price pursuant to the methodology 
under section 1847A of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w–3a); 
(8) the overall magnitude of bona fide serv-
ice fees; 
(9) what share of bona fide service fees are 
paid to various entities;

fees compares to other fees and rebates that 
are included in the determination of average 
sales price; 
(11) whether and, if so, how much, the mag-
nitude of bona fide service fees has grown 
over time and how such growth compares to 
growth in the magnitude of other fees and 
rebates; and 
(12) what share of bona fide service fees are 
based on a percentage of sales. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Inspector General shall submit to Congress a 
report containing the results of the study 
conducted under subsection (a), together

SEC. 208. RISK-SHARING VALUE-BASED PAYMENT 
AGREEMENTS FOR COVERED OUT-
PATIENT DRUGS UNDER MEDICAID. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1927 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r–8) is amended 
by adding at the end the following new sub-
section: 
‘‘(l) STATE OPTION TO PAY
FOR COVERED 
OUTPATIENT DRUGS THROUGH RISK-SHARING 
VALUE-BASED AGREEMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Beginning January 1, 
2024, a State shall have the option to pay 
(whether on a fee-for-service or managed 
care basis) for covered outpatient drugs that 
are potentially curative treatments intended 
for one-time use that are administered to in-
dividuals under this title by entering into a 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
with the manufacturer of the drug in accord-
ance with the requirements of this sub-
section. 
‘‘(2) SECRETARIAL APPROVAL.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A State shall submit a 
request to the Secretary to enter into a risk- 
sharing value-based payment agreement, and 
the Secretary shall not approve a proposed 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
between a State and a manufacturer for pay-
ment for a covered outpatient drug of the 
manufacturer unless the following require-
ments are met: 
‘‘(i) MANUFACTURER
HAS
IN
EFFECT
A
RE-
BATE AGREEMENT AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH 
ALL APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS.—The manu-
facturer has a rebate agreement in effect as 
required under subsections (a) and (b) of this 
section and is in compliance with all applica-
ble requirements under this title. 
‘‘(ii) NO EXPECTED INCREASE TO PROJECTED 
NET FEDERAL SPENDING.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—The Chief Actuary cer-
tifies that the projected payments for each 
covered outpatient drug under a proposed 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
is not expected to result in greater estimated 
Federal spending under this title than the 
net Federal spending that would result in 
the absence of such agreement. 
‘‘(II) NET FEDERAL SPENDING DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this subsection, the term ‘net 
Federal spending’ means the amount of Fed-
eral payments the Chief Actuary estimates 
would be made under this title for admin-
istering a covered outpatient drug to an indi-
vidual eligible for medical assistance under a 
State plan or a waiver of such plan, reduced 
by the amount of all rebates the Chief Actu-
ary estimates would be paid with respect to 
the administering of such drug, including all 
rebates under this title and any supple-
mental or other additional rebates, in the 
absence of such an agreement. 
‘‘(III) INFORMATION.—The Chief Actuary 
shall make the certifications required under 
this clause based on the most recently avail-
able and reliable drug pricing and product in-
formation. The State and manufacturer shall 
provide the Secretary and the Chief Actuary 
with all necessary information required to 
make the estimates needed for such certifi-
cations. 
‘‘(iii) LAUNCH
AND
LIST
PRICE
JUSTIFICA-
TIONS.—The manufacturer submits all rel-
evant information and supporting docu-
mentation necessary for pricing decisions as 
deemed appropriate by the Secretary, which 
shall be truthful and non-misleading, includ-
ing 
manufacturer 
information 
and 
sup-
porting documentation for launch price or 
list price increases, and any applicable jus-
tification required under section 1128L. 
‘‘(iv) CONFIDENTIALITY
OF
INFORMATION; 
PENALTIES.—The provisions of subparagraphs 
(C) and (D) of subsection (b)(3) shall apply to 
a manufacturer that fails to submit the in-
formation and documentation required under 
clauses (ii) and (iii) on a timely basis, or that 
knowingly provides false or misleading infor-
mation, in the same manner as such provi-
sions apply to a manufacturer with a rebate 
agreement under this section. 
‘‘(B) CONSIDERATION OF STATE REQUEST FOR 
APPROVAL.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall treat 
a State request for approval of a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement in the same 
manner that the Secretary treats a State 
plan amendment, and subpart B of part 430 of 
title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, includ-
ing, subject to clause (ii), the timing require-
ments of section 430.16 of such title (as in ef-
fect on the date of enactment of this sub-
section), shall apply to a request for ap-
proval of a risk-sharing value-based payment 
agreement in the same manner as such sub-
part applies to a State plan amendment. 
‘‘(ii) TIMING.—The Secretary shall consult 
with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs as 
required under subparagraph (C) and make a 
determination on whether to approve a re-
quest from a State for approval of a proposed 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
(or request additional information necessary 
to allow the Secretary to make a determina-
tion with respect to such request for ap-
proval) within the time period, to the extent 
practicable, specified in section 430.16 of title 
42, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect 
on the date of enactment of this subsection), 
but in no case shall the Secretary take more 
than 180 days after the receipt of such re-
quest for approval or response to such re-
quest for additional information to make 
such a determination (or request additional 
information). 
‘‘(C) CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSIONER 
OF FOOD AND DRUGS.—In considering whether 
to approve a risk-sharing value-based pay-
ment agreement, the Secretary, to the ex-
tent necessary, shall consult with the Com-
missioner of Food and Drugs to determine 
whether the relevant clinical parameters 
specified in such agreement are appropriate. 
‘‘(3) INSTALLMENT-BASED
PAYMENT
STRUC-
TURE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement shall provide for a 
payment structure under which, for every in-
stallment year of the agreement (subject to 
subparagraph (B)), the State shall pay the 
total installment year amount in equal in-
stallments to be paid at regular intervals 
over a period of time that shall be specified 
in the agreement. 
‘‘(B) REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLMENT PAY-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(i) TIMING OF FIRST PAYMENT.—The State 
shall make the first of the installment pay-
ments described in subparagraph (A) for an 
installment year not later than 30 days after 
the end of such year. 
‘‘(ii) LENGTH OF INSTALLMENT PERIOD.—The 
period of time over which the State shall 
make the installment payments described in 
subparagraph (A) for an installment year 
shall not be longer than 5 years. 
‘‘(iii) NONPAYMENT OR REDUCED PAYMENT OF 
INSTALLMENTS FOLLOWING A FAILURE TO MEET 
CLINICAL
PARAMETER.—If, prior to the pay-
ment date (as specified in the agreement) of 
any installment payment described in sub-
paragraph (A) or any other alternative date 
or time frame (as otherwise specified in the 
agreement), the covered outpatient drug 
which is subject to the agreement fails to 
meet a relevant clinical parameter of the 
agreement, the agreement shall provide 
that— 
‘‘(I) the installment payment shall not be 
made; or 
‘‘(II) the installment payment shall be re-
duced by a percentage specified in the agree-
ment that is based on the outcome achieved 
by the drug relative to the relevant clinical 
parameter. 
‘‘(4) NOTICE OF INTENT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), a manufacturer of a covered outpatient 
drug shall not be eligible to enter into a 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
under this subsection with respect to such 
drug unless the manufacturer notifies the 
Secretary that the manufacturer is inter-
ested in entering into such an agreement 
with respect to such drug. The decision to 
submit and timing of a request to enter into 
a proposed risk-sharing value-based payment 
agreement shall remain solely within the 
discretion of the State and shall only be ef-
fective upon Secretarial approval as required 
under this subsection. 
‘‘(B) TREATMENT
OF
SUBSEQUENTLY
AP-
PROVED DRUGS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a manufac-
turer of a covered outpatient drug des-
ignated under section 526 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, and ap-
proved under section 505 of such Act or li-
censed under subsection (a) or (k) of section 
351 of the Public Health Service Act after the 
date of enactment of this subsection, not

August 6, 2022 
more than 90 days after meeting with the 
Food and Drug Administration following 
phase II clinical trials for such drug (or, in 
the case of a drug described in clause (ii), not 
later than March 31, 2022), the manufacturer 
must notify the Secretary of the manufac-
turer’s intent to enter into a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement under this 
subsection with respect to such drug. If no 
such meeting has occurred, the Secretary 
may use discretion as to whether a poten-
tially curative treatment intended for one- 
time use may qualify for a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement under this 
section. A manufacturer notification of in-
terest shall not have any influence on a deci-
sion for drug approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
‘‘(ii) 
APPLICATION
TO
CERTAIN
SUBSE-
QUENTLY APPROVED DRUGS.—A drug described 
in this clause is a covered outpatient drug of 
a manufacturer— 
‘‘(I) that is approved under section 505 of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or 
licensed under section 351 of the Public 
Health Service Act after the date of enact-
ment of this subsection; and 
‘‘(II) with respect to which, as of January 
1, 2024, more than 90 days have passed after 
the manufacturer’s meeting with the Food 
and Drug Administration following phase II 
clinical trials for such drug. 
‘‘(iii) PARALLEL APPROVAL.—The Secretary, 
in coordination with the Administrator of 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
ices and the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs, shall, to the extent practicable, ap-
prove a State’s request to enter into a pro-
posed 
risk-sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agreement that otherwise meets the require-
ments of this subsection at the time that 
such a drug is approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration to help provide that no 
State that wishes to enter into such an 
agreement is required to pay for the drug in 
full at one time if the State is seeking to pay 
over a period of time as outlined in the pro-
posed agreement. 
‘‘(iv) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this paragraph shall be applied or construed 
to modify or affect the timeframes or factors 
involved in the Secretary’s determination of 
whether to approve or license a drug under 
section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act or section 351 of the Public 
Health Service Act. 
‘‘(5) SPECIAL PAYMENT RULES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as otherwise pro-
vided in this paragraph, with respect to an 
individual who is administered a unit of a 
covered outpatient drug that is reimbursed 
under a State plan by a State Medicaid agen-
cy under a risk-sharing value-based payment 
agreement in an installment year, the State 
shall remain liable to the manufacturer of 
such drug for payment for such unit without 
regard to whether the individual remains en-
rolled in the State plan under this title (or a 
waiver of such plan) for each installment 
year for which the State is to make install-
ment payments for covered outpatient drugs 
purchased under the agreement in such year. 
‘‘(B) DEATH.—In the case of an individual 
described in subparagraph (A) who dies dur-
ing the period described in such subpara-
graph, the State plan shall not be liable for 
any remaining payment for the unit of the 
covered outpatient drug administered to the 
individual which is owed under the agree-
ment described in such subparagraph. 
‘‘(C) WITHDRAWAL
OF
APPROVAL.—In the 
case of a covered outpatient drug that is the 
subject of a risk-sharing value-based pay-
ment agreement between a State and a man-
ufacturer under this subsection, including a 
drug approved in accordance with section 
506(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act, and such drug is the subject of an 
application that has been withdrawn by the 
Secretary, the State plan shall not be liable 
for any remaining payment that is owed 
under the agreement. 
‘‘(D) ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENT
UNDER 
AGREEMENT.—Subject to approval by the Sec-
retary, the terms of a proposed risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement submitted 
for approval by a State may provide that 
subparagraph (A) shall not apply. 
‘‘(E) GUIDANCE.—Not later than January 1, 
2024, the Secretary shall issue guidance to 
States establishing a process for States to 
notify the Secretary when an individual who 
is administered a unit of a covered out-
patient drug that is purchased by a State 
plan under a risk-sharing value-based pay-
ment agreement ceases to be enrolled under 
the State plan under this title (or a waiver of 
such plan) or dies before the end of the in-
stallment period applicable to such unit 
under the agreement. 
‘‘(6) TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS UNDER RISK- 
SHARING VALUE-BASED AGREEMENTS FOR PUR-
POSES
OF
AVERAGE
MANUFACTURER
PRICE; 
BEST PRICE.—The Secretary shall treat any 
payments made to the manufacturer of a 
covered outpatient drug under a risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement under this 
subsection during a rebate period in the 
same manner that the Secretary treats pay-
ments made under a State supplemental re-
bate agreement under sections 447.504(c)(19) 
and 447.505(c)(7) of title 42, Code of Federal 
Regulations (or any successor regulations) 
for purposes of determining average manu-
facturer price and best price under this sec-
tion with respect to the covered outpatient 
drug and a rebate period and for purposes of 
offsets required under subsection (b)(1)(B). 
‘‘(7) ASSESSMENTS
AND
REPORT
TO
CON-
GRESS.— 
‘‘(A) ASSESSMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the end of each assessment period of 
any risk-sharing value-based payment agree-
ment for a State approved under this sub-
section, the Secretary shall conduct an eval-
uation of such agreement which shall include 
an evaluation by the Chief Actuary to deter-
mine whether program spending under the 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
aligned with the projections for the agree-
ment made under paragraph (2)(A)(ii), in-
cluding an assessment of whether actual 
Federal spending under this title under the 
agreement was less or more than net Federal 
spending would have been in the absence of 
the agreement. 
‘‘(ii) ASSESSMENT PERIOD.—For purposes of 
clause (i)— 
‘‘(I) the first assessment period for a risk- 
sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agreement 
shall be the period of time over which pay-
ments are scheduled to be made under the 
agreement for the first 10 individuals who 
are administered covered outpatient drugs 
under the agreement except that such period 
shall not exceed the 5-year period after the 
date on which the Secretary approves the 
agreement; and 
‘‘(II) each subsequent assessment period for 
a risk-sharing value-based payment agree-
ment shall be the 5-year period following the 
end of the previous assessment period. 
‘‘(B) RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) TERMINATION OPTION.—If the Secretary 
determines as a result of the assessment by 
the Chief Actuary under subparagraph (A) 
that the actual Federal spending under this 
title for any covered outpatient drug that 
was the subject of the State’s risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreement was greater 
than the net Federal spending that would 
have resulted in the absence of the agree-
ment, the Secretary may terminate approval 
of such agreement and shall immediately 
conduct an assessment under this paragraph 
of any other ongoing risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement to which the same 
manufacturer is a party. 
‘‘(ii) REPAYMENT REQUIRED.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—If the Secretary deter-
mines as a result of the assessment by the 
Chief Actuary under subparagraph (A) that 
the Federal spending under the risk-sharing 
value-based agreement for a covered out-
patient drug that was subject to such agree-
ment was greater than the net Federal 
spending that would have resulted in the ab-
sence of the agreement, the manufacturer 
shall repay the difference to the State and 
Federal governments in a timely manner as 
determined by the Secretary. 
‘‘(II) TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO PAY.— 
The failure of a manufacturer to make re-
payments required under subclause (I) in a 
timely manner shall result in immediate ter-
mination of all risk-sharing value-based 
agreements to which the manufacturer is a 
party. 
‘‘(III) ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.—In the case 
of a manufacturer that fails to make repay-
ments required under subclause (I), the Sec-
retary may treat such manufacturer in the 
same manner as a manufacturer that fails to 
pay required rebates under this section, and 
the Secretary may— 
‘‘(aa) suspend or terminate the manufac-
turer’s rebate agreement under this section; 
and 
‘‘(bb) pursue any other remedy that would 
be available if the manufacturer had failed 
to pay required rebates under this section. 
‘‘(C) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 
5 years after the first risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement is approved under 
this subsection, the Secretary shall submit 
to Congress and make available to the public 
a report that includes— 
‘‘(i) an assessment of the impact of risk- 
sharing value-based payment agreements on 
access for individuals who are eligible for 
benefits under a State plan or waiver under 
this title to medically necessary covered 
outpatient drugs and related treatments; 
‘‘(ii) an analysis of the impact of such 
agreements on overall State and Federal 
spending under this title; 
‘‘(iii) an assessment of the impact of such 
agreements on drug prices, including launch 
price and price increases; and 
‘‘(iv) such recommendations to Congress as 
the Secretary deems appropriate. 
‘‘(8) GUIDANCE AND REGULATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than January 
1, 2024, the Secretary shall issue guidance to 
States seeking to enter into risk-sharing 
value-based payment agreements under this 
subsection that includes a model template 
for such agreements. The Secretary may 
issue any additional guidance or promulgate 
regulations as necessary to implement and 
enforce the provisions of this subsection. 
‘‘(B) MODEL AGREEMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If a State expresses an 
interest in pursuing a risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement under this sub-
section with a manufacturer for the purchase 
of a covered outpatient drug, the Secretary 
may share with such State any risk-sharing 
value-based agreement between a State and 
the manufacturer for the purchase of such 
drug that has been approved under this sub-
section. While such shared agreement may 
serve as a template for a State that wishes 
to propose, the use of a previously approved 
agreement shall not affect the submission 
and approval process for approval of a pro-
posed 
risk-sharing 
value-based 
payment 
agreement under this subsection, including 
the requirements under paragraph (2)(A). 
‘‘(ii) CONFIDENTIALITY.—In the case of a 
risk-sharing value-based payment agreement 
that is disclosed to a State by the Secretary 
under this subparagraph and that is only in

that is expected to result in any increase to 
projected net State or Federal spending 
under the agreement shall be subject to re-
certification by the Chief Actuary as de-
scribed in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) before the 
modification may be approved. 
‘‘(B) REBATE AGREEMENTS.—Nothing in this 
subsection shall be construed as requiring a 
State to enter into a risk-sharing value- 
based payment agreement or as limiting or 
superseding the ability of a State to enter 
into a supplemental rebate agreement for a 
covered outpatient drug. 
‘‘(C) FFP FOR PAYMENTS UNDER RISK-SHAR-
ING
VALUE-BASED

approval of such agreement by the Sec-
retary.
