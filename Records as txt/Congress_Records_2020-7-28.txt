PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
want to talk about the World Trade Or-
ganization. I have said what I am going 
to say now before. So I want to say it 
again: The United States must reaffirm 
its commitment to significant reform 
of the World Trade Organization. The 
United States must move to revitalize 
that organization because the World 
Trade Organization advances the cause 
of free and fair global trade, and they 
necessarily do it because of the modern 
economy we are in. 
It is imperative that we continue to 
double down on the efforts that dem-
onstrate the United States’ leadership 
at Geneva, the headquarters of the 
World Trade Organization. That in-
cludes our efforts to reform the World 
Trade Organization appellate body, to 
work on subsidies that too many coun-
tries are using, and to continue ongo-
ing negotiations to accomplish these 
goals. 
The World Trade Organization can 
and should play an important role in 
the global economic recovery from our 
virus pandemic. I urge the administra-
tion and my colleagues here in the Sen-
ate to advocate for our interests. I urge 
the Trump administration to confront 
trade distortions, and most impor-
tantly, this administration must en-
courage all World Trade Organization 
members to unite in an effort to lift us 
out of the nearly unprecedented global 
downturn we have had in trade because 
of the virus pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Yesterday, Senate 
Republicans put forward the HEALS 
Act, our framework for another round 
of historic relief for American workers 
and families. 
Our Nation stands at a challenging 
crossroads. We have one foot in this 
pandemic and one foot in the recovery. 
We can’t go back to April, and until we 
have a vaccine, we can’t go back to 
normal either. What the American peo-
ple need is smart, safe, and sustainable 
middle 
ground, 
and 
they 
need 
Congress’s help to construct it. That is 
exactly what our major proposal would 
do. 
Everyone knows that another rescue 
package will need to be bipartisan to 
pass the Senate. So the question before 
the country is now really quite simple: 
Are we going to see the versions of 
House and Senate Democrats that 
helped us unanimously pass the CARES 
Act back in March, or are we, instead, 
going to see the same Democrats who 
decided to block police reform in June 
and lash out at Senator TIM SCOTT’s 
proposal instead of working with him 
to make law? In other words, do the 
Speaker of the House and the Demo-
cratic leader believe that struggling 
Americans deserve an outcome, or do 
they want to stay on the sidelines and 
recite talking points? 
Well, yesterday, even before the 
Democrats had seen our legislation,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4516 
July 28, 2020 
they began attacking it. All the tired, 
old partisan tropes were trotted out. 
Before releasing a proposal that wants 
to give schools even more reopening 
money than the House Democrats’ bill 
and which would continue additional 
unemployment benefits at eight times 
the dollar amount Democrats estab-
lished during the last crisis, we were 
informed here on the floor that ‘‘those 
Republican hard-right money people 
. . . don’t want the Federal Govern-
ment to help anybody.’’ 
This is beyond parody. 
Republicans put forward a trillion- 
dollar proposal for kids, jobs, and 
healthcare, including direct cash to 
households, and even more cash to un-
employed people. And the Democrats 
say it proves we don’t want to help 
people. They say it proves we don’t 
want to help people. These are not seri-
ous statements. It is politics as usual, 
with talking points that went stale 20 
years ago. 
But the week is young and the 
HEALS Act is full of provisions I 
would, frankly, dare my Democratic 
colleagues to actually say they oppose. 
Republicans want to extend supple-
mental unemployment insurance at 
hundreds of dollars per week. If Demo-
crats block legislation, it will stop all 
together. 
Republicans want to send thousands 
of dollars more to American families 
through direct payments. If Democrats 
will not come to the table, they will 
get nothing. 
Republicans want to use tax incen-
tives to encourage the rehiring of laid- 
off workers and the creation of safer 
workplaces through things like testing, 
remodeling, and PPE. If Democrats 
block action, workers will be on their 
own. 
Republicans want to specifically pro-
tect Medicare seniors from a spike in 
premiums because of COVID. If Demo-
crats treat the HEALS Act the way 
they treated police reform, seniors will 
be on their own as well. 
Republicans want to pour money into 
K–12 schools and give greater flexi-
bility to childcare providers so Amer-
ica’s kids can have a safe but more nor-
mal school year. If Democrats block 
action, school districts will get none of 
us. 
Republicans want to create a second 
targeted round of PPE to keep small 
businesses above water. If Democrats 
will not negotiate, the ‘‘now open’’ 
signs will come down and the ‘‘going 
out of business’’ signs will replace 
them. 
Republicans want to proactively ex-
pand our domestic manufacturing ca-
pability for masks and PPE and med-
ical countermeasures. If Democrats 
refuse to negotiate, we will be just as 
dependent on adversaries as competi-
tors in the next crisis. 
Republicans want to protect doctors, 
nurses, school districts, and univer-
sities from a second epidemic of frivo-
lous lawsuits. If Democrats don’t come 
to the table, our Nation’s reopening 
will be at the mercy of trial lawyers. 
Republicans want to go even further 
to backstop hospitals and healthcare 
providers and fuel the sprint for vac-
cines. If Democrats will not let us, 
Americans will just have to cross our 
fingers and hope the medical system 
remains stable. 
To be clear, Republicans are not pro-
posing to ‘‘cut’’ any relief. Under cur-
rent law, expanded UI expires and is re-
placed with nothing. Under current 
law, there are no more direct payments 
and no second PPP. Every single thing 
we put forward is a way to get more re-
lief into people’s hands. 
Our Democratic colleagues want to 
pretend it is controversial, somehow, 
that taxpayers should not pay people 
more not to work than people who do 
go back to work. They want to pretend 
it 
is 
controversial 
that 
taxpayers 
should not pay people more not to 
work than people who do go back to 
work? The American people don’t call 
it a controversy. They call it common 
sense. They call it basic fairness. 
This is absolutely a time to be gen-
erous and provide additional Federal 
relief to people who have been laid off, 
but we should not be redistributing 
money away from the essential work-
ers who have remained at their posts. 
We should not be taxing somebody 
who has been stocking shelves for 
months so the government can pay 
their neighbor more than she makes to 
sit at home. That is what we are talk-
ing about—taxing essential workers to 
pay their neighbors a bonus to stay 
home. 
One study by university economists 
just found these benefits can exceed 
people’s previous incomes two-thirds of 
the time. They found a medium recipi-
ent earns 134 percent of their prior sal-
ary. That means half are making even 
more than that. That is just not fair. It 
is not compatible with a reopening 
economy and more than 6 in 10 Ameri-
cans feel this creates a disincentive to 
work. 
Even the Democratic House majority 
leader said just this morning that our 
perspective ‘‘has some validity to it 
and we have to deal with that . . . it’s 
not $600 or bust.’’ That was the major-
ity leader in the House. The Demo-
cratic majority leader in the House 
said: ‘‘It’s not $600 or bust.’’ So let’s 
get past these partisan cheap shots and 
have an adult conversation. 
Look at it this way. Think about one 
street, one block in one neighborhood, 
anywhere in America. Think how they 
would benefit if this bill were signed 
into law. Right now, several families 
on that block probably have no idea 
whether their kids will be heading back 
to school in a few weeks. Our bill would 
provide the money and legal certainty 
for school districts to reopen safely. 
Let’s talk about the families’ pocket-
books. Likely, every mailbox on that 
street or each checking account would 
get another $1,200 per adult and $500 per 
dependent. For a family of four, we are 
talking about $3,400 in cash. Maybe 
some of these homeowners are among 
the millions of Americans who have 
been thrown into joblessness. As we 
discussed, they would get hundreds of 
dollars more every week in added un-
employment. 
But because we are doing it smarter, 
if anyone on the street owns a coffee 
shop or a contracting business, they 
will not hear from workers that they 
are earning more by staying at home. 
Those unemployed workers will get 
back on the job faster when our bill 
supercharges incentives for rehiring 
and helps pay for health and safety in 
the workplace. 
Maybe some other people on the 
street have held onto their jobs be-
cause of the historic Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. Their employer is con-
sidering closing down with that relief 
nearly exhausted. Our targeted second 
round of PPP could keep their pay-
check coming instead of a pink slip. 
Maybe a retired couple lives on this 
block. If our proposal for Medicare 
Part B premiums becomes law, this 
couple will be protected from a spike in 
costs due to this pandemic, and need-
less to say, every single person on that 
street would benefit from even stronger 
Federal investments in the diagnostics, 
treatments, and vaccines that will ulti-
mately win this healthcare battle for 
all of us. 
So, look, it is very simple. Partisan 
histrionics will not get any American 
family any of the relief I just de-
scribed. Calling names will not get 
school districts one dime. Washington 
finger-pointing will not add 1 cent to 
anyone’s unemployment check. 
The Democrats face a simple choice. 
They can come to the table, work with 
the Republicans, and engage seriously 
to make law for the American people 
or they can stay on the sidelines, point 
fingers, and let another rescue package 
go the same way as the police reform 
bill they killed back in June. The Re-
publicans are ready to govern. We just 
need the Democrats to decide whether 
they are serious about actually making 
law.

District of Louisiana. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, after putting the Senate on 
pause for 3 months and after months of 
blocking nearly every Democratic at-
tempt to pass legislation related to the 
coronavirus, the Senate Republicans fi-
nally revealed their long overdue pro-
posal for the next phase of COVID re-
lief. 
In my many years of serving in this 
Chamber, I have never seen a Repub-
lican majority—a Senate majority of 
any type—respond to a national emer-
gency in such a disorganized and dis-
oriented fashion. Weeks of infighting 
among Senate Republicans and the 
White House caused unnecessary and 
harmful delays. 
Instead of presenting a single, unified 
bill, the Republicans released several 
separate drafts last night, and there 
might be more today. They can’t agree 
on one bill. They can’t get 51 votes for 
anything that is comprehensive and 
that deals with the very real problems 
the American people face. Even before 
the Republicans announced their bills, 
senior Republican Senators admitted 
they lacked the full support of the Re-
publicans. Two Republican chairmen 
have said that probably half of the Re-
publican Senate will vote against their 
own proposals. Worst of all, the Repub-
lican plan falls dreadfully short. It is 
ununified, unserious, and completely 
unsatisfactory. 
My Republican friends, this is the 
greatest crisis America has faced in 
generations—100 years since the last 
health crisis of this magnitude, 75 
years since the Great Depression—and 
you are paying attention to your cor-
porate friends and not answering the 
needs of the people. 
We Democrats want a real bill that 
answers people’s needs, that deals with 
the serious problems we face. That is 
what we are fighting for. We will keep 
fighting for it, and our Republican 
friends are nowhere to be found. 
While the Republican proposal fails 
to provide crucial relief for families, 
workers, and the unemployed, it is lit-
tered with corporate giveaways, K 
Street handouts, and Presidential pet 
projects. The Republican bill includes a 
$20 billion slush fund for large agri-
business and tax breaks for three-mar-
tini lunches, but it doesn’t provide a 
dime in food assistance for hungry 
kids. It includes an unprecedented, 
sweeping provision to shield corpora-
tions for 5 years from liability for neg-
ligent treatment of workers and con-
sumers, but there is no new, sweeping 
provision to shield Americans from 
evictions or foreclosures. 
It includes a $30 billion wish list for 
defense contractors but no funding to 
make sure Americans can vote safely 
in November. There are reports that 
the Republican proposal may include a 
provision to lower capital standards at 
the Wall Street big banks but nothing 
to help State, local, and Tribal govern-
ments keep teachers, firefighters, and 
busdrivers on the job. 
The Senate Republicans managed to 
sneak in nearly $2 billion in taxpayer 
funds for a new FBI building, the loca-
tion of which will increase the value of 
the Trump hotel and enrich the Presi-
dent and his family. Yes. In this pro-
posal, the Senate Republicans reward 
the President and his family’s business 
interests but not our essential workers. 
Whom do my Republican friends need 
to help more—President Trump, who 
proudly claims he is a billionaire, or a 
worker who is about to lose his job, a 
small businessperson whose business is 
going under, or a family who can’t feed 
hungry children? Who needs the help 
more—they or President Trump? 
Perhaps, worst of all, in the middle of 
the pandemic, the Senate Republicans 
and the White House want to give out- 
of-work Americans a 30-percent pay 
cut. If you have lost your job through 
no fault of your own and you can’t go 
back to work because the administra-
tion bungled this crisis, the Senate Re-
publicans propose taking $1,600 out of 
your pocket every single month. 
Well, let me show my colleagues 
what New Yorkers think of the Repub-
lican proposal: Let them eat cake. GOP 
plan slices $600 check and rejects aid to 
states. Let them eat cake. That is what 
New Yorkers think. That is what New 
Yorkers think. That is what Americans 
think. Let them eat cake. Shame. 
Shame on our Republican friends. 
The cover of the New York Daily 
News sums it up. Let them eat cake. 
‘‘Let them eat cake’’ sums up the Re-
publican proposal in response to the 
greatest economic crisis in 75 years. 
Let them eat cake. 
People can’t feed their kids. People 
are losing their homes, getting kicked 
out of their apartments. Small busi-
nesses are going under. The Republican 
response? Let them eat cake. 
Who are the Republicans fighting for 
in this proposal? Tax breaks for three- 
martini lunches but no food assistance 
for the poor? Immunity for corpora-
tions but no immunity for Americans 
facing eviction? Twenty, thirty million 
unemployed Americans and Repub-
licans say take a 30-percent pay cut? 
Who are the Republicans fighting for in 
this proposal? 
If you are a big bank, a defense con-
tractor, a member of the Trump fam-
ily, the Republican proposal has some 
good news for you, but if you can bare-
ly afford the rent, can’t find work, 
can’t feed your kids, or are fighting for 
your family’s future, the Republican 
plan leaves you out in the cold. 
The consequences of the Republican 
policy on unemployment alone would 
be disastrous. Those enhanced benefits 
have kept 12 million Americans out of 
poverty. Those enhanced benefits are 
the one bright spot in this declining 
economy—that consumer spending is 
going up now, in large part because of 
pandemic unemployment insurance as 
well as PPP. 
One of the few things that has kept 
our economy from deteriorating fur-
ther is that these unemployment bene-
fits have boosted consumer spending. 
That is why economists say the Repub-
lican proposal could cost over 1 million 
jobs this year and 3.4 million jobs next 
year. The Republican proposal is caus-
ing us to lose even more jobs. 
States have warned us that the Re-
publican plan on unemployment is un-
workable, to boot. We called State un-
employment offices yesterday to ask 
them what would happen if the Repub-
licans passed this new scheme. One 
State office simply said: Chaos. Chaos. 
Office after office said it would take 
weeks, weeks, months to even imple-
ment the new plan. What are people 
going to do during those weeks and 
months when they are not getting un-
employment insurance? 
The idea on the Republican side that 
we have to slash unemployment bene-
fits because otherwise Americans won’t 
go back to work is exaggerated. Ameri-
cans want to work, are ready to work, 
and are desperate to get back to work. 
Such little faith in the American peo-
ple. Such a bad outlook on human na-
ture. People want to work, Republican 
friends; they just don’t have jobs to do 
it, and we are not going to let them 
starve while that happens. 
God forbid we provide tens of mil-
lions of unemployed Americans a life-
line until we defeat this disease and get 
our economy back on its feet seems to 
be the Republican attitude. The Repub-
licans seem to think the American peo-
ple are a bunch of loafers. Well, they 
are not. 
Now, we Democrats want to get 
something done. We are certainly frus-
trated with the dithering, the disunity, 
and the lack of understanding of the 
depth of the crisis coming from the Re-
publican side, but that will not stop us. 
We must press on with bipartisan nego-
tiations. Time is running out. We can-
not afford to fail. But the Republican 
new proposal is not an adequate start-
ing point. 
History is repeating itself. Each time 
we came together in the past to pass 
COVID 2, COVID 3, and COVID 3.5, it 
was because both parties sat down with 
each other and negotiated and did the 
hard work. But that was only after Re-
publicans dared us and put an inad-
equate proposal on the floor and said: 
We will blame you. We held firm. They 
came back. We negotiated a much bet-
ter bill. My hope, my belief, is that 
they will have to do that again.

the floor. I can’t believe them. He 
keeps insisting that a bipartisan spirit 
led to the CARES Act, but he skips 
over the fact that he dropped a par-
tisan bill on the floor, and Democrats 
had to insist on continuing negotiating 
to make the bill significantly better. 
There is a lot of revisionist history 
going on on the other side of the aisle. 
This morning, MCCONNELL continued 
with his ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ logic, 
suggesting that Democrats are going to 
be the ones standing in the way of 
more relief. Let’s not forget that Re-
publicans dithered for 3 months while 
Democrats 
pleaded 
for 
action 
on 
COVID. Speaker PELOSI and I wrote to 
Leader MCCONNELL 3 weeks ago and 
said: Let’s sit down and talk. We didn’t 
hear a peep out of him. 
When Republicans finally woke up to 
the calamity in our country, they bick-
ered among themselves for a week, as 
the country approached several cliffs— 
unemployment, eviction, State and 
local government, and more. Now that 
the Republicans finally have a pro-
posal, it is corporate-focused, doesn’t 
meet the needs of the American people, 
and half of their own caucus probably 
won’t support it anyway. 
Leader MCCONNELL, a few minutes 
ago, said: If Democrats don’t want to 
negotiate a bill—I will remind the lead-
er that last night, Chief of Staff Mead-
ows, 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, and I were in the Speaker’s of-
fice negotiating. Why didn’t Mnuchin 
and Meadows bring MCCONNELL along? 
Because the Senate Republicans can’t 
get their act together and produce a 
unified position. 
So, Leader MCCONNELL, I have a sug-
gestion: Instead of blaming Democrats, 
how about Senate Republicans and 
Leader MCCONNELL get their act to-
gether, roll up their sleeves, and actu-
ally get to do real work and solve these 
problems. 
Every time—every time we have 
come to pass critical relief, Democrats 
have forced our Republican colleagues 
and the White House to come to the 
table and negotiate in a serious way. 
That is what we have to do again. We 
need bipartisan, bicameral negotia-
tions to produce a bill that meets the 
needs of the American people. We 
Democrats will continue to do that. 
Speaker PELOSI and I will be meeting 
with Mnuchin and Meadows again to-
night in an effort to try to get a bill 
because the needs of the American peo-
ple, the American economy, and the 
American health are so great. Let’s 
come together and get something done. 
America desperately needs our help. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague and leader 
on the Democratic side, Senator SCHU-
MER, for his specific, articulate, and di-
rect analysis of where we stand today 
in the Senate. 
Faced with the worst public health 
crisis in 100 years, faced with the worst 
economic crisis in 75 to 80 years, the 
message from the Republican side of 
the aisle is ‘‘Think small. Do as little 
as possible. Let’s see how this works 
out.’’ 
At a time when we have unemploy-
ment figures breaking all records, 
when we have 10 times the unemploy-
ment claims in Illinois that we did a 
year ago—I might add, 10 times the un-
employment claims in the Common-
wealth of Kentucky that they did a 
year ago—we, instead, are hearing from 
the Republican side of the aisle that 
the problem with our economy is not 
unemployment; it is the fact that the 
people who are unemployed are being 
given too much money. 
Right now we have a Federal benefit 
package worth $600 a week that was en-
acted in the CARES Act on March 26. 
That expires in 3 days. It is a $600-a- 
week Federal supplement over the 
State payment. What the Republicans 
have suggested is to cut that $600 Fed-
eral supplement to $200, and then they 
turn and say: Well, what we really 
want to do is to compensate the work-
ers with 70 percent of what they were 
earning when they were laid off. 
There is a real serious problem here 
that they are not disclosing to the 
American people. Back in March, when 
we proposed a similar approach or one 
that took into consideration the pre-
vious wages of an unemployed worker, 
who told us to stop that consideration? 
President Trump’s Secretary of Labor. 
Secretary Scalia came to us, and I was 
at the meeting when he said: You don’t 
understand. You cannot make this 
kind of change in the States because 
there are 50 different computer systems 
in the employment security offices 
across each and every State in the 
Union. They cannot make this adjust-
ment. They cannot make this change. 
The only way, they told us—Sec-
retary Scalia told us in March—is a 
flat dollar amount to each unemployed 
worker, which is exactly what we did. 
Now the Republicans come to us and 
ignore that advice, ignore that guid-
ance that led to $600 a week, and say: 
We will come up with an elaborate for-
mula of 70 percent of what you were 
paid before. 
As Senator SCHUMER from New York 
said earlier, we surveyed a dozen 
States, and they all told us: Impossible 
to 5 or 6 months before we are ready to 
do something in that manner. And that 
means, for millions of Americans cur-
rently unemployed, the possibility of 
only receiving $200 a week until some-
day in the future when the State unem-
ployment systems can possibly change. 
That is the Republican approach. 
They have made a big point, as Sen-
ator MCCONNELL did this morning on 
the floor, of a $1,200 check, a cash pay-
ment such as we had back in March. I 
am not opposed to that. The President 
is desperate for it because he gets to 
sign the checks. He wants his signature 
on the checks that are going out to 
these individuals. 
Well, Mr. President, if that is what 
you want, be my guest if it is going to 
help working families. But make no 
mistake—a $1,200 check to a family 
who was receiving $600 a week, $2,400 a 
month, is cold comfort, and it won’t 
help them pay the bills they face every 
single month. 
I only wish that the Republicans who 
are calling for these dramatic cuts in 
unemployment compensation for mil-
lions of Americans—30 million Ameri-
cans—I only wish they would go home 
to Kentucky and other States and sit 
down for a meal with an unemployed 
family and let them tell these Repub-
licans what they are facing each and 
every month, trying to get by, even 
with this unemployment check. 
You see, there is an assumption that 
these people have a lot of money in 
savings. It is not reality. In the real 
world, half of American families have 
little or no savings to turn to—even be-
fore this current economic downturn. 
Imagine what they are going through 
now and the sacrifices they have to 
make. 
Surely the Republican leaders have 
heard the stories or seen firsthand, as I 
have, the families showing up at food 
banks and pantries, looking for a help-
ing hand to put something on the table 
to feed their families, some of them 
with their eyes down to the ground, 
tears in those eyes because they never 
dreamed they would be in this position 
in life. And what is the alternative sug-
gested from the Republican side? Cut 
the unemployment compensation for 
millions of Americans at this moment 
in history. Think small, Republicans 
say. We can get through this by doing 
as little as possible. 
That is not true. We have been told 
over and over again that if we take our 
foot off the accelerator to try to move 
this economy out of the ditch, it will 
crash even further, and we don’t want 
that to happen. We want people to get 
back to work and businesses to reopen 
and schools to reopen, but we have to 
do the right thing in terms of providing 
compensation to individuals. 
I reject the premise that many Re-
publicans bring to this conversation 
that if you are not rich, you must be 
lazy in America. I don’t think unem-
ployed people in this country are lazy 
people. I think they are hard-working 
people who have been dealt a tough 
hand of cards. They are trying to keep 
their families together until they can 
get back to work and to a decent job. 
Cutting unemployment compensation 
at this moment in history is cruel, in-
humane, and insensitive to the reali-
ties these families are facing every sin-
gle day. 
There is one provision that came out 
yesterday that I want to speak to for a 
moment. For months, literally for 
months, Senator MCCONNELL has come 
to the floor and criticized Speaker 
PELOSI for her efforts to pass the He-
roes Act almost 10 weeks ago. Ten 
weeks ago, the House of Representa-
tives, under Speaker PELOSI, passed 
legislation to provide COVID–19 relief 
that we knew was coming because we

July 28, 2020 
knew the unemployment benefits were 
going to expire in just a few days. She 
saw that coming and 10 weeks ago did 
what was the right thing to do. She 
mustered her troops and provided a 
majority to vote for a package that 
moves us forward, helps State and local 
governments face the reality of this 
economy, helps hospitals, and helps in-
dividuals pay for their health insur-
ance—a good package and one that I 
could readily support. 
Senator MCCONNELL
came to the 
floor 
frequently, 
regularly, 
several 
times a week, saying how bad that 
package was, how terrible it was, while 
he did nothing, while the Republicans 
proposed no alternative. It is just like 
the Affordable Care Act. They have 
done everything they can 150 times to 
try to repeal it and never once pro-
posed an alternative. The same thing is 
true when it comes to this COVID–19 
relief. In this circumstance we received 
finally, yesterday, this proposal that 
was brought by Senator CORNYN on be-
half of himself and Senator MCCONNELL 
to address the issue of the immunity of 
corporations from lawsuits that have 
any relation to COVID–19—immunity 
for these corporations so that they will 
not be held liable if, in fact, they are 
not performing up to the standards 
necessary to protect employees and 
customers. 
It is 65 pages long. It is a big give-
away to the biggest corporations in 
America. The Republican corporate im-
munity bill does nothing to protect 
workers, improve safety standards, or 
give business incentives to take proper 
precautions to reduce the spread of the 
coronavirus. 
In fact, this bill does the opposite. It 
views workers and victims as the prob-
lem, and it sets high hurdles that pre-
vent meritorious COVID-related crimes 
from having their day in court. What 
the bill would do is impose sweeping 
Federal preemption on the rights of 
workers and victims to bring cases in 
State courts for COVID-related harm. 
It would supplant State laws that re-
quire businesses to act with reasonable 
care. Then it would say that businesses 
are shielded from liability in Federal 
court if they merely make an effort to 
comply with the weakest available 
mandatory safety standard that applies 
to them so long as they are not grossly 
negligent. 
So what are the kinds of safety 
standards that the bill would urge busi-
nesses to follow? Well, it certainly 
wouldn’t be the guidelines of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control because those 
aren’t mandatory. So, amazingly, a 
business can get shielded from liability 
under this Republican approach even if 
they make no effort to comply with the 
Centers for Disease Control guidelines. 
How does that make us any safer? 
Not only that, but if workers or sick 
Americans want to try to bring a meri-
torious COVID-related case in this bill, 
this bill puts them through a gauntlet 
of tort reform obstacles that will make 
it nearly impossible to prevail: a 
heightened burden of proof, heightened 
pleading requirements, limits on dis-
covery, damage caps, restrictions on 
joint and several liability, and so much 
more. The Republican bill also creates 
sweeping Federal preemption of med-
ical 
malpractice 
cases, 
including 
claims under medical malpractice not 
even related to COVID–19. It would 
upend the medical liability laws of all 
50 States for 5 years. 
Instead of sending a strong, clear, 
and enforceable Federal safety stand-
ard like an OSHA emergency tem-
porary standard, the Republican bill 
would actually shield businesses from 
regulatory 
enforcement 
proceedings 
under OSHA, the Fair Labor Standards 
Act, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, and more. 
The liability immunity under this 
bill would last for 5 years, from Decem-
ber 2019 to 2024. The fact that Repub-
licans are proposing 5 years of liability 
immunity for corporations while prom-
ising just a few months of assistance 
for workers tells the whole story about 
priorities and values. 
Let’s be clear. Republicans have not 
made the case for why we would even 
consider Federal liability immunity for 
corporations. Remember, under current 
State tort law, if a business has taken 
reasonable precautions, it will not be 
held liable for negligence. State laws 
give incentives for businesses to act 
reasonably, and most businesses do. 
Also, time and again, I have heard Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and Senator CORNYN 
come to the floor and talk about the 
tsunami of lawsuits. This morning Sen-
ator MCCONNELL said ‘‘an epidemic’’ of 
frivolous lawsuits. 
It so happens we keep track of law-
suits filed in the United States of 
America, and we can look to the plead-
ings in those lawsuits to see how many 
times they mention coronavirus or 
COVID–19. We know how many lawsuits 
have been filed since the first of the 
year related to this pandemic. We 
know that despite the fact that 4 mil-
lion—at least 4 million—COVID–19 in-
fections have been established in the 
United States—4 million—do you know 
how many medical malpractice cases 
have been filed by any of those 4 mil-
lion Americans or anyone else against 
doctors, nurses, hospitals, and pro-
viders? What is the epidemic number? 
We have it. Here is the exact number of 
medical malpractice cases filed in the 
United States in the last 6 months: 
six—six. An epidemic? A tsunami? 
How about personal injury lawsuits, 
Senator? How many have been filed 
listing COVID–19 or coronavirus as one 
of the reasons for these lawsuits? Fif-
teen. With 4 million infected Ameri-
cans, there are 15 lawsuits, and the Re-
publicans have come to us and want to 
turn upside down the immunity and li-
ability questions before the States and 
the Nation. 
How about unsafe workplace law-
suits? Now, that has to be a big cat-
egory. With 4 million infected Ameri-
cans, how many workers have brought 
lawsuits? Seventy-one. In the entire 50 
States of America, there are 71 law-
suits. 
There is no flood of worker or victim 
lawsuits. It is a figment of the imagi-
nation of Senator MCCONNELL, Senator 
CORNYN, and K Street. But we certainly 
shouldn’t, at this moment in time, ig-
nore the obvious. Over 20 States have 
stepped forward and established their 
own standards for lawsuits when it 
comes to the pandemic they face. This 
effort by the Republicans would pre-
empt that State action. There have 
been hundreds and hundreds of COVID 
lawsuits that have been filed, business 
to business, on questions like insur-
ance liability. You don’t hear the Re-
publicans wanting to stop businesses 
from filing lawsuits—no, just workers 
and the people who get sick. 
There is no need for the Federal Gov-
ernment to step in and override 50 
States’ liability laws, especially after 
the Federal Government has been de-
ferring to the States on every other as-
pect of this pandemic: testing, PPE, 
masks, stay-at-home orders. Time and 
again, this President has said to leave 
it to the Governors and leave it to the 
mayors, except when it comes to pro-
tecting big corporations. If States need 
to adjust their liability laws, they can 
do so, and 28 States have already done 
it. 
So here is the bottom line. The Re-
publican immunity bill would upend 
State laws, give businesses incentives 
to cut corners, jeopardize the safety of 
workers and families, and risk further 
spread of this virus. It is a big business 
giveaway, and that is not what Amer-
ica needs. 
This is not a small challenge; it is a 
historic challenge. We shouldn’t take 
the Republican lead and play small 
ball. We ought to address this head-on. 
First, we need leadership from the 
top, which we have not had from the 
President. He has deferred time and 
again to Governors and mayors and 
other officials at the local levels, tell-
ing them: Find your own masks. Estab-
lish your own testing regimes. Find 
your own way out of this crisis. 
When we needed Federal leadership 
from the President, we did not receive 
it. America knows that. Why is it that 
this Nation, with 5 percent of the 
world’s population, has 25 percent of 
the COVID infection cases in the 
world? Why? What happened here? Why 
didn’t we follow the lead of other coun-
tries that stepped up with Presidential 
leadership—countries that have found 
dramatically less infection, dramati-
cally fewer deaths. That is the reality 
of where we are today with this pan-
demic. 
The reality of our economy—we 
stepped in on March 26 and passed the 
CARES Act. We have managed to keep 
some businesses going. We have man-
aged to keep millions of unemployed 
Americans together with their families 
through the most difficult period in 
their lives. Now, at this moment, the 
Republican 
leadership 
says:

small. This is all going to pass quickly. 
Don’t worry about these families who 
don’t have enough to provide food and 
shelter and the basics for their fami-
lies. They will get by with a lot less— 
from $600 a week to $200 a week. They 
will do just fine, according to Repub-
licans. 
I disagree. Our first obligation should 
be to these working families who are 
going through the toughest period they 
could ever imagine. Stick with them. 
Stand with them. Be prepared to put 
the money on the table, which we know 
they will spend right back into the 
economy. 
We will see more unemployment if 
we follow the Republican approach. It 
is estimated that some 3 million jobs 
will be killed by the Republican ap-
proach of cutting unemployment and 
the consequent downturn in spending 
by these same families. 
Let’s stick with those families now. 
They need us. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
Congress has no greater responsibility 
than providing for a strong national 
defense and keeping Americans safe. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act is one of the most important pieces 
of legislation that is considered each 
year by the U.S. Senate. It authorizes 
the weapons systems, programs, and 
resources that support the men and 
women who serve our country in the 
Armed Forces as well as their families. 
Last week, the Senate completed its 
work on the fiscal year 2021 National 
Defense Authorization Act for the 60th 
consecutive year. The bill received, as 
it should, wide bipartisan support in an 
86-to-14 vote. I was proud to support 
the NDAA. 
In my home State of Colorado, our 
military installations, including Fort 
Carson, the Air Force Academy, Buck-
ley, Peterson, and Schriever Air Force 
Bases, along with Cheyenne Mountain 
Air Force Station, are on the cutting 
edge of space operations, military 
training and readiness, and protecting 
our national security. 
I want to thank Chairman INHOFE 
and the ranking member for their bi-
partisanship at the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and for doing such 
a great job in fulfilling their tremen-
dous responsibility in providing for na-
tional defense. It cannot be overstated 
enough how grateful we all are, and I 
appreciate the time and work they 
dedicated to this effort. The security of 
the United States should always be 
more important than any partisan poli-
tics, and I appreciate their commit-
ment to placing national defense above 
partisan bickering. We have seen how 
even in the most rancorous political 
times Republicans and Democrats can 
come together through the Defense Au-
thorization Act to renew the country’s 
commitment to a free and open Indo- 
Pacific region, such as when the Asia 
Reassurance Initiative Act became law 
in December 2018. 
As was stated in the U.S. Department 
of Defense ‘‘Indo-Pacific Strategy Re-
port,’’ which was released in July of 
last year, ‘‘This legislation [ARIA] en-
shrines a generational whole-of-govern-
ment policy framework that dem-
onstrates U.S. commitment to a free 
and open Indo-Pacific region and in-
cludes initiatives that promote sov-
ereignty, rule of law, democracy, eco-
nomic engagement, and regional secu-
rity.’’ 
Now the U.S. Senate has taken the 
next step toward renewing the coun-
try’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific 
region by passing this NDAA bill, en-
shrining and establishing a new Pacific 
Deterrence Initiative, PDI, that will 
complement ARIA and implement its 
vision of a more robust U.S. military 
presence in the Indo-Pacific. This ini-
tiative will enhance the security com-
mitment set forth in ARIA and help 
guide the Congress and the Pentagon in 
making the tough choices necessary to 
prioritize the Indo-Pacific and to ex-
tend critical deterrence initiatives to 
check our adversaries. 
Earlier 
this 
summer, 
Chairman 
INHOFE and I authored an op-ed entitled 
‘‘Renewing America’s Commitment to 
the Indo-Pacific.’’ It described the Pa-
cific Deterrence Initiative, which will 
complement the Asia Reassurance Ini-
tiative Act and implement its vision of 
a more robust U.S. military presence in 
the Indo-Pacific. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have the op-ed in the Dip-
lomat of July 2, 2020, be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Diplomat, July 2, 2020]

AMERICA’S
COMMITMENT
TO
THE 
INDO-PACIFIC—A NEW PACIFIC DETERRENCE 
INITIATIVE
WILL
COMPLEMENT
ARIA AND 
IMPLEMENT ITS VISION OF A MORE ROBUST 
U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE INDO-PA-
CIFIC 
(By Jim Inhofe and Cory Gardner) 
As China brashly tries to impose its own 
system of rules and order in the Pacific, the 
United States and our allies in the Indo-Pa-
cific confront a time for choosing. We must 
choose to advance our vision for a free and 
open Indo-Pacific. We must choose to ensure 
the success of the principles of regional and 
global order that remain essential to our 
shared security and prosperity. These are 
difficult choices that will come at increas-
ingly greater cost. Beijing will do its best to 
make sure that the right choice and the easy 
choice are never the same, but we believe 
Americans and our allies are up to the task. 
For instance, U.S. allies like Australia are 
already making the tough choices, while 
braving Beijing’s bluster and bullying. By 
standing by its calls for an independent in-
quiry into the origins of the coronavirus and 
by remaining open to trade while refusing to 
trade away fundamental values, Australia 
has set a proud example for all the world. As 
Beijing lashes out across the region from the 
Himalayan Mountains to the South China 
Sea, Australia’s actions serve as a reminder 
for our other allies that in a free and open 
Indo-Pacific, right makes might—and not 
the other way around. 
Australia should not be alone in this ef-
fort. The United States stands with our al-
lies, and we are prepared to make our own 
tough choices. 
In the United States, we have seen how 
even in the most rancorous political times, 
Republicans and Democrats have joined to-
gether to renew the country’s commitment 
to the Indo-Pacific region, like when the 
Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) be-
came law in December 2018. As was stated in 
the U.S. Department of Defense Indo-Pacific 
Strategy Report, released in July 2019: ‘‘This 
legislation enshrines a generational whole- 
of-government policy framework that dem-
onstrates U.S. commitment to a free and 
open Indo-Pacific region and includes initia-
tives that promote sovereignty, rule of law, 
democracy, economic engagement, and re-
gional security.’’ 
In the coming days, the U.S. Senate will 
take the next step toward renewing the 
country’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific 
region by passing the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, which 
establishes a new Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive that will complement ARIA and imple-
ment its vision of a more robust U.S. mili-
tary presence in the Indo-Pacific. This ini-
tiative will enhance the security commit-
ments set forth in ARIA, and help guide Con-
gress and the Pentagon in making the tough 
choices necessary to prioritize the Indo-Pa-
cific and extend critical deterrence initia-
tives to check our adversaries. 
Last year, a seminal report from the 
United States Studies Centre (USSC) at the 
University of Sydney provided one of the 
clearest explanations of why the need for the 
Pacific Deterrence Initiative is both real and 
urgent. The report shows how China is at-
tempting to ‘‘undercut America’s military 
primacy’’ and ‘‘sowing doubt about Washing-
ton’s security guarantees in the process.’’ In 
the face of this development, the report de-
scribes an ‘‘increasingly worrying mismatch 
between America’s strategy and resources,’’ 
especially in the Indo-Pacific. Even as 
‘‘America’s military services have started to 
implement much needed changes,’’ the re-
port warns, it’s not clear that America will 
have the ‘‘budgetary capacity or strategic 
focus to deliver these in a robust and timely 
way.’’ We share these concerns, and the Pa-
cific Deterrence Initiative is designed explic-
itly to address them. 
First, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative 
will enhance budgetary transparency and 
congressional oversight by organizing our 
defense budget around critical Indo-Pacific 
priorities. The initiative will make it easier 
to translate regional priorities into budget 
priorities, and ensure that security require-
ments are being matched with the necessary 
resources. 
Second, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative 
will focus resources on key capability gaps 
to give U.S. forces everything they need to 
compete, fight, and win in the Indo-Pacific. 
The initiative would focus new resources in 
many of the areas recommended by the 
USSC report, including a more distributed 
regional defense posture, resilient logistics 
networks, fuel and munitions storage, mis-
sile defenses for U.S. bases, and more experi-
mentation to test and prove new operational 
concepts. 
Third, consistent with ARIA provisions,

prioritize cooperation with allies and part-
ners across the Indo-Pacific. The initiative 
will increase security assistance for our re-
gional allies and partners, and invest in 
interoperability. In the future, we expect the 
initiative will provide resources to support 
new mechanisms for deepening regional de-
fense cooperation, including multinational 
fusion centers and joint training and experi-
mentation. 
Fourth, and finally, the Pacific Deterrence 
Initiative will help preserve peace in the 
Indo-Pacific by bolstering credible deter-
rence. The initiative will focus resources on 
efforts to deny our adversaries the possi-
bility of a quick, easy, or cheap victory. By 
injecting uncertainty and risk into the cal-
culations of our adversaries, we can discour-
age them from choosing the path of aggres-
sion. 
The Pacific Deterrence Initiative is by no 
means a cure-all. After all, achieving cred-
ible deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region is 
not America’s task alone. It can only be re-
alized through a collective effort with our al-
lies and partners such as Australia. More-
over, the challenges we face today are not 
limited to, or even primarily, military in 
character. As ARIA emphasized, we must 
also step up our diplomatic and economic se-
curity efforts while remaining true to our 
values. Nonetheless, we hope the Pacific De-
terrence Initiative will serve as another 
demonstration to our mates in Australia, as 
well as our other allies and partners in the 
Indo-Pacific, that America’s commitment to 
the region remains bipartisan and enduring. 
Mr. GARDNER. I would also like to 
thank my colleagues for their bipar-
tisan work on the Defense bill. We had 
a number of bipartisan amendments in-
cluded and provisions that improve the 
use of secure facility space and make 
sure military communities have access 
to clean and safe drinking water—an 
incredibly important issue facing Colo-
rado, Colorado Springs, the Fort Car-
son area, and others as they address 
the PFAS issues this Nation has dealt 
with. 
I think it is important to remember 
that when one member of the family 
serves our country in uniform, the en-
tire family serves, and this legislation 
supports military families in Colorado 
and truly all over the world. It pro-
vides a much needed pay increase for 
our military members and continues to 
support military spouses seeking em-
ployment. 
The NDAA addresses the challenges 
servicemembers and their families face 
living in privatized housing. It expands 
resources to continue to address PFAS 
water contamination in our military 
communities. 
In Colorado, we are proud to play a 
very key role in defending the United 
States. Our military installations are 
critical to national security and sup-
porting operations in space. This year’s 
defense 
authorization 
includes 
lan-
guage to ensure there is transparency 
when it comes to selecting the final 
home for the headquarters—the perma-
nent basing decision of U.S. Space 
Command—and that Space Command’s 
critical mission drives the decision-
making process. That is what we en-
sured through the Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. 
The bill also supports the ongoing 
standup of our Nation’s newest mili-
tary branch, the U.S. Space Force, to 
include my legislation establishing the 
Space Force Reserve. The Space Force 
Reserve will mirror its sister military 
service branches, and as a result, the 
Space Force will better organize the 
military to handle Space Force’s oper-
ations and bring all military members 
working in the space domain under the 
same organizational umbrella. 
General Raymond is working hard to 
make sure the U.S. Space Force is agile 
and prepared to respond to national se-
curity threats in the space domain. 
As we continue to work in estab-
lishing the U.S. Space Force, Colorado 
is proud to continue its support of our 
Nation’s military operations in space. 
That is why in the coming weeks I will 
be working with my colleagues in the 
Senate to establish the U.S. Space 
Force Caucus, led by bipartisan co- 
leads and chairs. The caucus will pro-
vide my colleagues and their staff the 
opportunity to learn more about mili-
tary space operations and the critical 
threats we face in the space domain. I 
welcome my colleagues’ support and 
participation in the establishment of 
this caucus. 
Again, I thank my colleagues, Chair-
man INHOFE
and Ranking Member 
REED, for their work on this important 
bill, and I am proud to support legisla-
tion that authorizes $268 million for 
military construction projects in Colo-
rado and provides a 3-percent pay raise 
for the men and women serving our Na-
tion in uniform. 
With that, I yield the floor.

world we are living in today is a very 
different one than we envisioned when 
we rang in the new year in the begin-
ning of 2020 or even when we celebrated 
St. Patrick’s Day in March. COVID has 
altered almost every aspect of our 
lives, from where we gather to cele-
brate or mourn to how our children are 
educated. 
Far too many across the country 
have lost loved ones to this disease, or 
they are living with health complica-
tions because of it. However, while we 
are rightly focusing much of our en-
ergy on the coronavirus, this is not the 
only health crisis we are battling. 
Unfortunately, across the Nation, 
drug overdose deaths are rising amidst 
the coronavirus, negating much of the 
progress we have made over the last 
several years. A White House Office of 
National Drug Control Policy analysis 
shows an 11.4-percent increase in fatali-
ties for the first 4 months of 2020. My 
home State of West Virginia reported 
923 overdose-related EMS calls in May, 
which is roughly a 50-percent jump 
from May of 2019. Our neighboring 
State of Kentucky—and I am sure the 
neighboring State of Ohio too—has es-
timated a 25-percent increase in over-
dose 
deaths 
between 
January 
and 
March. 
Is COVID–19 directly causing these 
overdose deaths? No. Is the pandemic 
exacerbating our Nation’s addiction 
struggle? Absolutely. It is not hard to 
see why. The past several months have 
been difficult for all of us; however, for 
someone in recovery, this disruption 
may cause them to have a hard time 
keeping their treatment regimens in 
place. The need for social distancing 
makes in-person recovery programs 
that are a lifeline for some almost im-
possible. Social distancing may also 
lead to more individuals using drugs 
alone, raising the risk of overdose 
deaths because there is no one there to 
help or intervene. 
Last week, I had a chance to talk 
with CDC Director Redfield about 
where we are in our Nation’s battle 
against 
addiction. 
The 
preliminary 
CDC data recently released showed 
drug overdose deaths climbed to a 
record high last year and how the ad-
diction crisis continues to shift also, 
with overdose deaths rising in our 
other States, such as Alaska and the 
Dakotas. He also pointed out that 
deaths 
involving 
methamphetamine 
and cocaine have been steadily increas-
ing despite the fact that deaths caused 
largely by synthetic opioids have been 
decreasing—or actually pills, have been 
decreasing. We talked about how issues 
like neonatal abstinence syndrome, 
where babies are born exposed to 
opioids, continue to spread. 
We talked about the work we have 
done here in Congress and what we con-
tinue to need to do. Over the years, as 
I mentioned, we have seen a decline in 
the deaths from prescription opioids. 
We have seen increases in access to 
treatment 
resources. 
Moreover, 
we 
have seen a recognition that, as a 
country, we have a real addiction cri-
sis. However, these recent statistics 
and the evidence we are seeing related 
to substance abuse during our current 
pandemic show us there is so much 
more work to do, and it has a sense of 
urgency to it for many of us. 
This sentiment was also shared when 
I met with Director Carroll of the 
ONDCP. We met in Huntington just 
last Friday. Huntington is a town that 
is particularly hard hit by addiction. 
Director Carroll expressed his concern 
over the rising numbers of overdose 
deaths. He acknowledged that the pub-
lic health threat posed by COVID–19 
and the essential mitigation measures 
implemented across the country to 
slow the spread together have created 
unprecedented obstacles for Americans 
seeking drug treatment. 
We discussed some of the responses 
the Trump administration has taken to 
the pandemic and our new reality. The 
Trump 
administration 
has 
relaxed 
some of the rules related to the pre-
scribing of medication-assisted treat-
ment. That has been helpful. The in-
creased role of telehealth in behavioral 
and mental health care—that has been 
helpful. 
The Director updated me on ONDCP’s 
work in working to address the specific

impact drug addiction is having on 
rural 
America. 
Just 
last 
month, 
ONDCP and other Federal agencies 
launched the Rural Community Tool-
box, which is an online clearinghouse 
created with the express purpose of 
connecting rural leaders with funding, 
data, and information on how to com-
bat drug addiction. We know resources 
in rural America are not as plentiful as 
they are in other areas of the country. 
We also discussed the administra-
tion’s effort at the southern border to 
keep illegal drugs out of our commu-
nities. I am particularly interested in 
this area, as I chair the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security, 
a 
subcommittee 
of 
Appropriations. 
Through this role, I was able to focus 
on the needs on the interdiction side so 
that drugs do not even physically get 
to West Virginia in the first place. I 
have been to our southern border, 
which is actually where most of the 
drugs are coming from that end up in 
my State. I have worked with Customs 
and Border Protection, the TSA, the 
Secret Service, and the Coast Guard to 
make sure they remain focused on this 
incredibly important aspect of our na-
tional problem. 
I am also extremely proud of the 
work that the HSI division has done on 
homeland 
security. 
They 
have 
in-
creased their presence in West Virginia 
and the number of officers, equipment, 
and partnerships, such as with Mar-
shall University, to help supplement 
the work of our local law enforcement. 
HSI has expanded their presence at 
international 
mail 
facilities—some-
thing I have been a strong proponent 
of, and many of us in this body have as 
well. 
Earlier this month, the Department 
of Homeland Security issued a 2019 sei-
zures report to Congress. This report 
confirms that a majority of drugs con-
tinue to come in from our southwest 
border, including cocaine, fentanyl, 
heroin, marijuana, and methamphet-
amine. 
Challenges as a nation and individ-
ually fill our reality today. How I wish 
the drug addiction epidemic did not 
have to continue to be one of them. 
Sadly, as many families across our Na-
tion know all too well, it continues to 
ruin many lives. Wishing it away is not 
going to work. We must continue to 
keep our eye on the ball and provide 
the resources necessary to resume the 
progress we have begun to see. 
My colleagues and I on both sides of 
the aisle have worked with the Senate 
Appropriations Committee to commit 
much 
needed 
resources. 
Chairman 
BLUNT has shown his dedication to the 
cause, both through the regular appro-
priations and through our stimulus 
bills. We continue to work to ensure 
that behavioral and mental health pro-
viders have the resources they need to 
continue to treat patients and keep 
their offices open. I am working with 
bipartisan colleagues on creative ways 
to address this crisis, whether by en-
suring that doctors can offer non- 
opioid choices as they resume elective 
surgeries through my NOPAIN Act 
with Senator JONES, or by ensuring 
that those in treatment and recovery 
can use the technologies of today to 
connect virtually to peers and coun-
selors through the Prescription Digital 
Therapeutics to Support Recovery Act 
that I introduced with Senator SHA-
HEEN, or by arming families with the 
information and resources they need to 
help their loved ones stay in recovery 
during these trying times through the 
Family Support Services for Addiction 
Act that I have worked on with Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND. 
Fortunately, we continue to not be 
alone in this fight. Despite the other 
demands they are currently facing, 
community and local organizations 
continue to rise to the challenge. Just 
last week, Shatterproof, which is a na-
tional nonprofit organization dedicated 
to reversing the addiction crisis in 
America, 
launched 
the 
Addiction 
Treatment Locator, Assessment, and 
Standards Platform, also known as 
ATLAS. ATLAS is the first resource of 
its kind to help those seeking addiction 
treatments find high-quality care and 
appropriate care. It was launched in six 
States. I am happy to say West Vir-
ginia was one of them, with the hope of 
expanding it to many more. 
Our Nation is facing unprecedented 
challenges; however, I remain con-
fident that we can meet all of them, in-
cluding resuming the progress we had 
begun to make on our Nation’s addic-
tion crisis. I am dedicated to this, pas-
sionate about it, and look forward to 
continuing to work with my colleagues 
on creative solutions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
thank Senator CAPITO for not letting 
this body and this country forget about 
this terrible addiction crisis that has 
afflicted her State, my State, and par-
ticularly our region of the country, but 
well beyond that, her work has been 
particularly important, and I thank 
her for doing that. 
I think it also points to the impor-
tance of our doing, during this pan-
demic, other things to support local 
governments that are so stretched with 
Medicaid dollars and with local public 
health dollars. That is the importance 
of the next round of pandemic fund-
ing—State 
and 
local 
governments, 
local communities, and local edu-
cation. 
We know that Senator MCCONNELL’s 
effort—and I put the word ‘‘effort’’ in 
quotation marks—has fallen so short. 
He waited and waited and waited and 
waited and waited. The House passed 
its bill in May. This body, through Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, would not even take 
it up until—would not even begin nego-
tiations, really, until this week, when 
unemployment is about to expire and 
when the eviction moratorium is about 
to expire. If the opioid crisis, public 
health crisis, is bad now and we 
haven’t dealt with the coronavirus, 
well, now imagine what will happen 
when people lose their unemployment 
or when it is reduced to $200 a week, 
causing mass eviction. Moratoria are 
expiring, and eviction courts are open-
ing up all over the country. Imagine 
what will happen with the opioid addic-
tion public health disaster and imagine 
what will happen with coronavirus if 
people lose their apartments in large 
numbers. 
I just don’t think any of us can quite 
imagine that tragedy. It is clear that 
my colleagues on this side of the aisle 
don’t get out very much, don’t talk to 
people very much, and don’t listen to 
people very much and see what these 
huge needs are for people to continue 
some semblance of the standard of liv-
ing they had prior to the coronavirus. 
NOMINATION OF DANA T. WADE 
Madam President, I rise to oppose 
the nomination of Dana Wade to serve 
as the Federal Housing Commissioner 
and Assistant Secretary for Housing. 
Mrs. Wade has a long record of public 
service—I credit her for that—both in 
the Senate and this administration. 
She worked at HUD and as staff to the 
Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs Committee. However, the poli-
cies that Mrs. Wade has supported dur-
ing her work in the Trump administra-
tion led me to believe she is not the 
right person to lead HUD’s housing and 
home ownership programs at this crit-
ical time. 
Just last year, Mrs. Wade held a sen-
ior political role at the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. During her ten-
ure at OMB, Mrs. Wade signed off on 
budget 
proposals 
that 
would 
have 
slashed HUD’s funding by billions, 
eliminated 
CDBG 
and 
HOME 
pro-
grams—programs critical to affordable 
housing and community development— 
and raised rents on the lowest income 
renters. She also signed off on rules 
that could displace more than 55,000 
children from their homes. I don’t 
think that is the person we want dur-
ing the pandemic, when all the mora-
toria on evictions expire, when the ma-
jority party wants to cut $400 a week 
from unemployed workers—these are 
unemployed workers—and when evic-
tion courts are open. I just question 
whether Mrs. Wade, even in this admin-
istration, is the right person to temper 
some of their actions that might end 
up with more people denied housing. 
She signed off on a rule that denied 
transgender individuals experiencing 
homelessness the right to seek shelter 
according to their gender identity. She 
signed off on a rule that cut HUD’s af-
firmatively furthering fair housing reg-
ulation—an important civil rights pro-
tection required by the Fair Housing 
Act, an act written and pushed and ini-
tially implemented by the father of the 
Senator from Utah. I know he is really 
proud of his dad, and I know he is real-
ly proud of HUD’s fair housing laws of 
the late 1960s. 
On Mrs. Wade’s watch, HUD and OMB 
proposed to allow communities to ig-
nore and exacerbate segregation even

as they spend Federal funds. That is 
not the only civil rights rollback that 
Mrs. Wade oversaw. During her tenure, 
OMB signed off on HUD’s proposal to 
undermine the disparate impact stand-
ard under the Fair Housing Act—a pro-
posal that the civil rights community, 
the largest mortgage lenders, the Mort-
gage Bankers Association, and the Na-
tional Association of Realtors have all 
said should not be finalized because it 
could erode civil rights protections. All 
the groups that deal with housing: the 
conservative groups, the progressive 
groups, the civil rights groups, the 
firms that make their living from 
housing, the realtors, the mortgage 
bankers—all of them said: Don’t move 
forward with this. She signed off on it 
with HUD’s proposal. 
When I asked Mrs. Wade about her 
time at OMB, she wouldn’t speak about 
the work she did, but she endorsed 
every one of these policies the Trump 
administration advanced during her 
tenure. 
Since Mrs. Wade returned to HUD in 
December, the Trump administration 
has doubled down on its assault on fair 
housing. 
Just last week, the Trump adminis-
tration released its final rule, all but 
eliminating communities’ legal obliga-
tion to affirmatively further fair hous-
ing. And now President Trump wants 
Mrs. Wade to oversee FHA and critical 
housing programs for low-income fami-
lies, for seniors, and for persons with 
disabilities. 
HUD and FHA have an essential role 
to play in our housing system during 
this pandemic. FHA is designed to play 
a countercyclical role, stepping in to 
keep the market working during eco-
nomic downturns like the one we are 
in. 
In the weeks and months ahead, fam-
ilies will need access to sustainable 
mortgages, and renters will need access 
to safe affordable apartments. Home-
owners who are struggling to make 
their payments will need forbearance 
and help getting back on track. At the 
end of forbearance, if we want to avoid 
a wave of foreclosures—we know what 
is happening with evictions about to 
happen in a much more concerted tidal 
wave sort of way if Senate Republicans 
get their way by shrinking, by cutting 
$400 per unemployed worker—$400 a 
week—and the moratorium on evic-
tions expiring and the eviction courts 
open. We know what will happen there. 
We are also, of course, concerned about 
the subsequent or, at the same time, 
wave of foreclosures. We need FHA to 
keep up its important work. They can 
do more. They must do more. 
Over the past several months, fol-
lowing the murder of George Floyd at 
the hands of police and with racial and 
ethnic health and economic disparities 
exacerbated by COVID–19, our country 
has finally begun to talk about the sys-
temic racism that exists throughout 
every system, including housing. It is 
the justice system. It is education. We 
know more and more about the huge 
digital divide. It is the justice system. 
It is education. It is healthcare. 
We know that African-Americans’ 
life 
expectancies 
are 
considerably 
shorter than White Americans. We 
know the infant mortality rate and 
maternal mortality rate are consider-
ably higher. We know all of those 
things. The American public is finally 
recognizing them. This is an oppor-
tunity. With housing, it was Jim Crow; 
then it was redlining; and now it is 
these rules that the Trump administra-
tion is lacking in. Conversely to what 
Mrs. Wade has advocated for, argued 
for, and done, HUD and FHA must be a 
part of addressing that systemic rac-
ism now and after this pandemic. FHA 
could start by helping Black and 
Brown families stay in their homes so 
we don’t repeat the mistakes of the 
2008 crisis, where Black borrowers and 
Brown borrowers were more likely to 
lose their homes to foreclosure. 
At the end of this pandemic, FHA 
and HUD’s rental programs can also 
help families recover financially and 
access 
affordable 
homeownership, 
maybe for the first time, but it will 
take a commitment from FHA and a 
commitment from HUD to address the 
massive inequity that still exists. 
This President, we know, actively 
undermines fairness in our housing sys-
tem. We saw it again last week when 
he boasted that he would maintain seg-
regation in our communities. It is a po-
litical act, of course. Just like sending 
Federal troops into Portland is a polit-
ical act, just like his purporting to 
stand up to China, which he hasn’t 
done for 4 years, is a political act, but 
we see it now as he divides people in 
the 
suburbs. 
Unfortunately, 
rather 
than working to fulfill the promise of 
the Fair Housing Act, HUD is aiding 
the President’s effort. 
Based on Mrs. Wade’s recent work 
and the policies she has helped to ad-
vance, I am concerned she will not 
stand up to the President’s efforts to 
turn back the clock on fair housing. 
She will, instead, in all likelihood, help 
this administration take our housing 
system in the wrong direction. That is 
why I oppose her nomination. 
I hope, if she is confirmed, she proves 
me wrong. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
HONORING AND COMMEMORATING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
LEGACY 
OF 
REPRESENATTIVE JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. 
PERDUE. 
Madam 
President, 
throughout all of human history, in 
every generation, there are a handful 
of people who rise to the level of great-
ness. Despite adversity, danger, and 
sometimes impossible odds, these great 
men and women fight for what is right 
and push our society forward and make 
America better for the next generation. 
That has been true for the last 230 
years. 
Representative John Lewis in our 
generation, who just passed away last 
week, was certainly the embodiment of 
this type of greatness. John was a titan 
in the struggle for civil rights and the 
equality of all races. Because of him, 
more Americans can enjoy their God- 
given rights to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. 
John’s lifelong fight against injustice 
began at a very young age, as we now 
know. When his local library banned 
African Americans from checking out 
books, a teenaged John Lewis wrote a 
petition 
requesting 
and 
demanding 
equal access. 
From that point forward, John Lewis 
never backed down from the fight for 
what is right. He always remained 
peaceful, despite receiving physical vi-
olence and going to jail for his pro-
tests. 
His 
commitment 
to 
nonviolence 
served as a guiding force in John’s life. 
He founded the Student Nonviolent Co-
ordinating Committee to fight for non-
violent resistance across America. 
In 1961, he participated in the Free-
dom Rides to protest segregation in 
public transportation. 
John’s determination for equal rights 
only grew stronger and more effective 
over time. At age 23, he was one of the 
‘‘Big Six’’ leaders of the March on 
Washington where Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., shared his dream for a better 
future for everyone. 
Later, John bravely marched across 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, 
AL, where he was beaten in what was 
called Bloody Sunday. 
The efforts of John Lewis and others 
finally paid off with the passage of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. That bill 
gave African Americans the right to 
fully participate in our democratic Re-
public. It pushed our country forward. 
That incredible victory may seem 
like the end of John’s struggle for 
equal rights. In reality, it was just the 
beginning. For the rest of his life, John 
Lewis never lost sight of what the real 
fight involved. 
During his time in the Atlanta City 
Council and later in Congress, he never 
gave up the fight for justice. 
Today, our country is mourning a 
hero, a truly great American, and a 
great Georgian. 
As we continue to say our good-byes, 
we should also take this time to reflect 
on John Lewis’s life and what he stood 
for. We should take this as a call to ac-
tion to continue the effort to which he 
dedicated his life. 
The stain of injustice still marks our 
country. Just this year, there have 
been horrible tragedies that have shak-
en all of us to our core. Though John 
Lewis is no longer with us, we can still 
carry on his legacy. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
660, submitted earlier today, and that 
the text be read in full. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will read the resolution. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
S. RES. 660 
Whereas the Senate mourns the loss of 
John Lewis, a titan in the struggle for civil 
rights and equality for all races, and com-
memorates his life and accomplishments; 
Whereas John Lewis was born during the 
era of Jim Crow in a segregated community 
in which racism and discrimination ran 
rampant; 
Whereas John Lewis’s moral clarity and 
unwavering 
commitment 
to 
nonviolence 
made his first passions preaching and min-
istry; 
Whereas John Lewis fought his first battle 
against segregation when he was just a teen-
ager, authoring a petition for equal access to 
his local public library, where African Amer-
icans had paid for the construction of the fa-
cilities but were banned from checking out 
books; 
Whereas, before his 21st birthday, John 
Lewis established his commitment to ‘‘good 
trouble’’ by organizing sit-ins at segregated 
restaurants and theaters; 
Whereas John Lewis helped found the Stu-
dent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
which advocated for civil disobedience and 
nonviolent resistance against segregation 
across the United States, bringing him to 
the forefront of the struggle of the United 
States for civil rights; 
Whereas John Lewis participated in the 
1961 Freedom Rides, which were a series of 
trips that tested a new desegregation order 
of interstate transportation facilities and re-
sulted 
in 
multiple 
beatings 
and 
the 
firebombing of the bus that John Lewis was 
supposed to be riding; 
Whereas, at 23 years of age, John Lewis 
served as the youngest member of the ‘‘Big 
Six’’, which planned the 1963 March on Wash-
ington, and worked alongside Martin Luther 
King, Jr., James Farmer, A. Philip Ran-
dolph, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young to 
advocate for racial equality and justice for 
all; 
Whereas John Lewis courageously led 
protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
in Selma, Alabama, bravely bearing violence 
from the police to embody the struggle of 
the United States to live up to its founding 
ideals of equal justice under the law;

Whereas the bravery of John Lewis during 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ led Congress to pass, and 
President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign into 
law, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
10301 et seq.), ensuring that African Ameri-
cans have the right to fully participate in 
the democratic process in the United States; 
Whereas John Lewis faithfully served the 
city of Atlanta between 1977 and 1981, em-
bodying his election night promise to ‘‘bring 
a sense of ethics and moral courage’’ to the 
Atlanta City Council; 
Whereas John Lewis faithfully served the 
5th congressional district of Georgia in the 
House of Representatives between 1987 and 
2020, serving as the ‘‘conscience of the Con-
gress’’ by continuing his pursuit of justice 
and truth in the capital of the United States; 
and 
Whereas the Senate commends John Lewis 
for his life and for embodying the spirit of 
love and dignity through his unceasing advo-
cacy for reconciliation, justice, and the 
equality of all mankind: Now, therefore, be

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today as the Senate 
works on the next phase of pandemic 
relief and recovery legislation. The 
country is united in combating the 
coronavirus. 
The Senate’s top priority is pro-
tecting the American people, and we 
are working together to save lives. 
America is fighting a war—a war 
against a deadly disease. There is no 
retreating, no giving up the American 
fighting spirit. We will finish the fight. 
The key to victory is to control the 
virus spread until we have a vaccine. A 
successful vaccine is vital to beat the 
virus and to return to normal life. The 
race for a COVID–19 vaccine is as im-
portant as putting a man on the Moon. 
We have made incredible progress. Vac-
cine development is well ahead of 
schedule. The administration’s public- 
private partnership, Operation Warp 
Speed, has started phase 2 and phase 3 
vaccine trials much sooner than ex-
pected. These are human trials. If all 
goes well, we hope to have a vaccine 
ready by the end of this year. 
Senate Republicans will make sure 
Americans have a safe, effective vac-
cine as soon as possible. It will be the 
most accessible vaccine in the history 
of the United States. Meanwhile, we 
should all do our part to slow the 
spread, and we know what that means. 
That means socially distancing, using 
good hygiene, and wearing a mask. 
This is the time for all of us to come 
together. But instead of fighting the 
virus, Democrats are waging a never- 
ending bidding war for more govern-
ment spending. People want and people 
need and people deserve real leader-
ship. They expect us to slow the spread 
of the virus and to protect the vulner-
able. 
We have made tremendous progress 
on testing. We have tested over 50 mil-
lion people already, and we are close to 
conducting 1 million tests—1 million 
tests—every day. We also have better 
treatments for the disease, and we are 
taking care of our most vulnerable citi-
zens—seniors and people with chronic 
medical conditions. 
At the same time, the economy is 
bouncing back. We had record job 
growth in May, as well as in June. That 
is because the Senate responded quick-
ly to the health and economic crisis. 
The Senate’s historic CARES Act res-
cue package has helped this country 
weather the storm. We have come far 
since the spring lockdowns. Still, some 
believe that the worst of the virus may 
be yet to come. 
The Senate has put together a com-
monsense plan to aid the recovery. 
This week, Senate Republicans intro-
duced a framework bill for the next 
coronavirus relief legislation. It is the 
capstone to our pandemic rescue oper-
ation. Our plan focuses on getting peo-
ple back to work and kids back to 
school and doing it safely, as well as, of 
course, defeating the disease. The Sen-
ate proposal provides even more re-
sources for testing and healthcare. 
This means more for hospitals, more 
for treatment, and more for vaccines. 
Our package includes over $100 bil-
lion for schools to open safely, plus 
funding for childcare. The Senate plan 
provides liability protection. We shield 
the medical community, K–12 schools, 
colleges, universities, and small busi-
nesses from frivolous lawsuits. Our 
plan includes another round of PPP 
loans, helping the hardest hit small 
businesses. We also send a targeted sec-
ond round of direct payments to indi-
viduals. The Senate package extends 
unemployment benefits in a way that 
encourages, not discourages, work. We 
cannot continue to pay people more to 
stay home than they would make at 
work. So we end the $600 weekly ben-
efit bonus. That is in contrast to 
NANCY PELOSI’s $3 trillion-and-growing 
bill, her so-called Heroes Act. Her 
package actually makes it easier for 
the economy to stay closed and much 
harder for the economy to reopen fully. 
The Senate is focused on healthcare, 
on kids, and on jobs. Democrats, it 
seems, have other priorities—endless 
bonus checks for staying home, bloated 
bailouts for mismanaged cities and 
States, and runaway spending unre-
lated to the challenge before us. 
Pre-pandemic, we had a booming 
economy. We had record job growth, 
and we had record low unemployment. 
We are working to restore Americans’ 
confidence. A solid majority of Ameri-
cans now say they see their finances as 
stable. 
I urge my Senate Democratic col-
leagues to come to the table. It is time 
to find common ground and to finish 
the fight. 
Together, Madam President, we will 
make sure that America wins the war. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE 
RESILIENCE ACT 
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, the 
word 
‘‘bipartisanship’’ 
gets 
tossed 
around a lot in this town. Unfortu-
nately, we don’t often see bipartisan-
ship put into action. However, as we 
have faced an unprecedented crisis re-
cently, I believe we have seen the Sen-
ate prove that it can, in fact, get it 
done. People can come together, and 
real, bipartisan solutions can actually 
happen in this body. 
It is actually encouraging to me—and 
it is simply a function of what I have 
known since I was a kid—that Ameri-
cans deal with a crisis better than any-
one else. In many ways, we put things 
aside, and we get together for what is 
good for the people back home. 
Since the COVID–19 crisis began, we 
have passed three phases of relief pack-
ages to help our country weather this 
COVID–19 storm. In these three phases, 
we ramped up testing in support of our 
healthcare workers, we helped Ameri-
cans who are struggling financially, 
and we created the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, which has saved millions 
of jobs and many businesses. Today, as 
we debate a fourth COVID–19 relief 
package, it is absolutely critical that 
we continue to find common ground 
and bipartisan solutions to bring our 
country together again. 
The Healthcare Workforce Resilience 
Act is a real, bipartisan solution to a 
serious problem our country faces 
today in our healthcare delivery sys-
tem. This bill is first and foremost a 
healthcare bill that will help our hos-
pitals deal with this COVID–19 crisis. It 
is absolutely critical that we include it 
in the next COVID–19 relief package. 
Today in America, many commu-
nities are facing severe shortages of 
doctors and nurses. Particularly, hos-
pitals and clinics in rural areas and 
communities of color are badly under-
staffed and are struggling to fill cru-
cial positions. 
My home State of Georgia has been 
especially impacted by this particular 
crisis. While Georgia is the 8th largest 
State by population, it ranks 39th in 
the number of active physicians per 
capita—39th. Over half of Georgia’s 159 
counties have been designated as pri-
mary care health professional shortage 
areas. The Georgia Department of Pub-
lic Health has stated that Georgia’s 
nursing shortage is a full-blown crisis. 
This is also true in most other States, 
actually. They have warned that Geor-
gia is not able to recruit the nurses or 
doctors our hospitals need. But we can 
change that. 
The COVID–19 crisis did not start 
this shortage of healthcare workers, by 
the way, but it has exacerbated it dra-
matically. 
Since the beginning of this crisis, I 
have held conference calls with thou-
sands of constituents across Georgia 
over the last 41⁄2 months. I have heard 
directly from healthcare workers who 
have explained the dire situation they 
are facing. Nurses and doctors are 
working longer hours. Retirees are 
being asked to come back to work. 
Many healthcare workers have con-
tracted the virus themselves. In fact,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4527 
July 28, 2020 
one study found that healthcare work-
ers account for nearly one in five 
COVID–19 cases. 
In many areas, hospitals have simply 
not had enough staff to handle the 
COVID–19 patient increase. Albany, 
GA, was one of the first hardest hit 
areas in the country, right there in 
South Georgia. At one point, nurses 
and doctors from all over the country 
had to be flown in just to take care of 
all those who fell ill in Albany. In 
many cases, patients had to be ex-
ported to other hospitals in the State. 
As this virus continues to spread, 
many hospitals are in danger of being 
overwhelmed as we see this recent 
surge of COVID–19 cases, particularly 
in our younger people. 
Healthcare workers have been true 
heroes—there is no question about 
that. Right now, we have an oppor-
tunity to give them the support they 
desperately 
need. 
The 
Healthcare 
Workforce Resilience Act is a bipar-
tisan solution that gives our hospitals 
the support they need to get through 
this crisis. Our bill simply recaptures 
unused green cards to give highly 
skilled, foreign-born nurses and doctors 
the opportunity to work in our country 
and help solve this crisis. It will recap-
ture approximately 25,000 unused visas 
for nurses and 15,000 unused visas for 
doctors. This bill would cut redtape 
and give our hospitals critical support 
quickly as America continues to re-
open our economy. It will ease the 
pressure on healthcare providers and 
help save American lives. 
I want to emphasize that this bill 
will not increase current legal immi-
gration 
limits, 
displace 
American 
workers, 
or 
negatively 
impact 
healthcare worker wages. 
I have always been a supporter of a 
merit-based immigration system, and 
many people on the other side of the 
aisle are as well. We all continue to 
work in that direction. We believe that 
a merit-based immigration system can 
strengthen our economy and protect 
American jobs at the same time. This 
is a policy that President Trump and 
the majority of Congress have long 
supported—on both sides of the aisle, 
actually. The Healthcare Workforce 
Resilience Act is fully aligned with 
these merit-based policies. 
These immigrant nurses and doctors 
have already been hired and approved 
to work in our country. Many of them 
live here already. The only thing pre-
venting them from saving lives is bu-
reaucratic redtape and the backlog it 
creates. These folks are highly skilled, 
well qualified, and extremely moti-
vated to be on the frontlines in the 
fight against COVID–19. They are all 
ready to go in the areas that need the 
most help. 
This bill is truly bipartisan. I am 
very proud to say that today. It has 36 
cosponsors from both parties. I give the 
lead sponsor on the Democratic side, 
my friend from Illinois, Senator DUR-
BIN, a lot of credit for that. He has long 
been a champion for this sort of help in 
this area. This bill reflects what the 
American people want. It provides 
what our healthcare system needs. It 
has bipartisan support. 
Actually, in 2005, Congress passed a 
similar bill. That bill recaptured un-
used visas and helped address a nursing 
shortage that existed at the time 
across the country. It passed with over-
whelming and nearly unanimous sup-
port. The coronavirus has put our 
country in a similar position today. 
There is no time to wait. The deeper 
our nurse and doctor shortage gets, the 
more Americans we are needlessly put-
ting at risk. 
President John F. Kennedy once said: 
‘‘In a time of domestic crisis, men of 
goodwill and generosity should be able 
to unite regardless of party or poli-
tics.’’ I don’t think that comment has 
been any more timely than it is today 
in the midst of this crisis. 
We are indeed in a time of crisis. We 
have already shown that we can unite 
and find meaningful solutions. It is 
time to do it again. Let’s get this bill 
across the finish line and support our 
healthcare workers and save lives in 
America. 
Madam President, I yield the floor to 
my colleague from Illinois, Senator 
DURBIN, the lead Democratic cosponsor 
on the Healthcare Workforce Resil-
ience Act, and I want to thank him for 
his tireless efforts in this regard and 
his strong leadership to help the young 
men and women on the frontlines of 
our healthcare delivery system. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me thank my colleague, the senior 
Senator from the State of Georgia, for 
joining me in this bipartisan effort. We 
now have some 36 sponsors and cospon-
sors of this legislation. 
Immigration can be a divisive issue, 
but this is an immigration measure 
that is not divisive. It has unified us on 
a bipartisan basis, as it should. We are 
talking about the Healthcare Work-
force Resilience Act. We are talking 
about men and women who, as we 
speak on the floor of the Senate in the 
safety of this Chamber, are literally 
risking their lives as healthcare profes-
sionals across the United States to deal 
with this pandemic, which we fight 
every single day. 
Last week, we sent a bipartisan let-
ter urging congressional leaders to 
make this bill part of any COVID–19 re-
lief legislation. Currently pending be-
fore the Senate is a negotiation with 
the White House, the House, the Sen-
ate—Democrats and Republicans—to 
make sure that we continue to move 
forward to fight this pandemic and to 
restore the vibrancy of our own econ-
omy. The letter we sent was cosigned 
by Senators LEAHY, YOUNG, and COONS, 
as well as Representatives SCHNEIDER, 
COLE, FINKENAUER, and BACON, who 
were the lead sponsors of the House 
version of the same bill. We are now up 
to, I understand, 37. They said 36 ear-
lier. I am told we have 18 Republicans 
and 19 Democrats, and the window is 
open for those who want to join us in 
this bipartisan effort. They will not re-
gret it. 
Our bill is a temporary stopgap meas-
ure, but it is designed to strengthen 
our healthcare workforce and improve 
healthcare access for Americans in the 
midst of this crisis. Consider this re-
ality when it comes to fighting the 
COVID–19 virus: In the United States, 1 
in 6 healthcare and social workers, 3.1 
million—1 in 6—of the 18.7 million are 
immigrants. Yet our broken immigra-
tion laws prevent many of these immi-
grants from contributing more fully to 
the battle against this pandemic. 
Under current law, there are not 
enough immigrant visas, which we also 
call green cards, available each year. 
As a result, immigrants are stuck in 
crippling backlogs for many, many 
years. The green card backlog, which I 
have debated with Senator LEE on the 
floor many times—but this green card 
backlog includes thousands of medical 
doctors currently working in our coun-
try on temporary visas. This backlog 
puts them and their families at the 
risk of losing their immigration status 
and being deported. It hinders their 
ability to fight against COVID–19 be-
cause these doctors face many restric-
tions due to their temporary status. 
For example, many of these doctors 
cannot take shifts at hospitals in 
COVID–19 hotspots where they are des-
perately needed. The Healthcare Work-
force Resilience Act, which we bring to 
the floor, would reallocate 25,000 un-
used immigrant visas for nurses and 
15,000 unused immigrant visas for doc-
tors. These are visas Congress has pre-
viously authorized but were never used. 
It is important to note that our bill 
requires employers to attest that im-
migrants overseas who receive these 
visas do not displace the employment 
of any American workers. We want to 
ensure that the beneficiaries of this 
bill 
complement, 
not 
replace, 
the 
American healthcare workforce. 
I am going to tell you the story of 
one of these doctors who is practicing 
in downstate Illinois in the Quad Cities 
area in Moline. I can tell you, as a 
downstater myself, there are many 
areas of downstate that are rural, 
small town, and cannot bring in the 
specialists who are needed. That is why 
these doctors become so important 
when they step in and provide their 
services. Let me tell you about this 
doctor. 
His name is Dr. Bhanu Vakkalanka. 
He sent me a letter and told me his 
story, and he asked me to help work to 
pass this piece of legislation. Dr. 
Vakkalanka and his wife, Dr. Sasi 
Royyuru—excuse 
me 
for 
mispro-
nouncing—Royyuru—are both physi-
cians. They met in medical school in 
India, and they came to the United 
States 15 years ago in 2005—15 years 
ago. At the time, their children—a 
young girl and boy—were 5 and 3 years 
old. 
Before they came to the United 
States, they had trained and worked

July 28, 2020 
for 10 years in England. Both achieved 
great professional success, but they 
were drawn to move to the United 
States. They were drawn to our free-
dom, our equality, and the opportunity 
that really is our trademark in the 
world. 
This is what Dr. Vakkalanka told me 
about his family’s move to the United 
States, and I want to quote his words: 
It was not an easy transition. We had to 
start all over again as residents. It was chal-
lenging to take care of two young children in 
the middle of our long working hours and 
paltry salaries with no one to fall back on. 
. . . But we had not come this far to give up 
on our dreams easily. 
Dr. Vakkalanka now works as a med-
ical oncologist for the UnityPoint 
Health System in Moline, in my home 
State of Illinois, a well-respected insti-
tution. Dr. Royyuru is a family physi-
cian in Bloomington, IL. There is a 
long drive between the two, Moline and 
Bloomington. 
Here 
is 
what 
Dr. 
Vakkalanka told me about his life in 
America: 
Despite the initial hardship, we fell in love 
with the United States soon after we came 
here. People were welcoming and generous. 
We were made to feel like we were part of 
this society from day one and we felt that 
this is where we belonged. We felt blessed, 
happy and proud to be able to live here, raise 
our children and call it our home. 
Let me tell you, he tells me how for-
tunate he was. I believe we are the for-
tunate ones—fortunate to have two ex-
ceptional physicians and their children 
as residents of my home State. 
Unfortunately, Dr. Vakkalanka and 
Dr. Royyuru, his wife, are two of thou-
sands of doctors who are stuck in a bu-
reaucratic backlog called the green 
card backlog. They have lived in the 
United States for 15 years. Their green 
card petitions were approved nearly a 
decade ago. Yet, even today, after more 
than 10 years, they are not lawful resi-
dents. Why? Because the backlog of 
people seeking these green cards— 
these immigration visas—is so large. 
In the midst of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the temporary immigration sta-
tus of this family puts them at real 
risk. Why? If, God forbid, they would 
contract COVID–19 and become dis-
abled or die, their family will instantly 
lose their immigration status and be 
forced to leave the United States. For 
15 years they have waited, and for 10 
years they have been on the actual 
queue, the waiting list for green cards, 
and if one of them takes ill and cannot 
work, they could all be deported. 
Now their children, who were 5 and 3 
when 
they 
arrived 
in 
the 
United 
States, are 20 years old and 18 years 
old. This is significant. They grew up 
in this country, but they are at risk of 
aging out in this bureaucratic system. 
If they reach the age of 21, these two 
children, who have lived here virtually 
all of their teenage and adolescent 
life—if they reach the age of 21 and 
have not been able to apply for a green 
card, they are subject to deportation. 
Can you imagine how devastating it 
would be for this doctor and his wife to 
think that their children, after all 
these years, would be deported from 
the United States? It is a very real 
risk. 
Dr. Vakkalanka told me: 
Our children waited for 15 years or longer 
along with us for their turn. They laughed 
with us and cried with us for all these years. 
It is not fair to kick them out of the line for 
no fault of theirs. They have nowhere else to 
go. This country is their only home! 
Dr. Vakkalanka and Dr. Royyuru’s 
family story makes clear why Congress 
needs to include the Healthcare Work-
force 
Resilience 
Act 
in 
the 
next 
coronavirus relief legislation. Under 
our bill, these two good doctors from 
India, and thousands of others like 
them, would finally receive their green 
cards. They and their families would 
get the permanent immigration status 
they deserve and be able to use their 
skills to serve on the frontlines of the 
pandemic wherever they are needed 
most. 
Let’s face it. This pandemic is test-
ing us as a nation, testing us as to 
whether we will have the endurance 
and the determination to get through 
this pandemic but equally testing us as 
to whether we care for one another. 
Certainly, we care for our families. We 
spend a lot of time with them. We 
worry about not being able to be next 
to our children or grandchildren be-
cause of fear of infection, and it is a 
real test. But it is also a test of our 
values of who we are. 
This man, after giving 15 years to the 
United States, practicing medicine in 
areas where he is desperately needed, is 
simply asking for a chance to become a 
legal, permanent resident of the United 
States. It is not too much to ask. For 
all he has given us, and his wife as 
well, we owe it to him and his family 
to give them the peace of mind that 
they have a future in the United 
States. They have proved that they are 
deserving. 
I hope, even in these divided political 
times, we can come together in Con-
gress to quickly aid these immigrant 
health heroes. 
I commend my colleague from Geor-
gia. I thank him. He had to step away 
from the floor at this moment, but I 
thank him for joining me in this bipar-
tisan effort. 
Let’s get this done. Let do the right 
thing for this doctor, for his family, 
and for so many others. 
RACISM 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
great 
writer, 
James Baldwin, told us: 
Not everything that is faced can be 
changed. But nothing can be changed until it 
is faced. 
The national discussion on race and 
racism in the wake of the death of 
George Floyd in Minneapolis has really 
opened the eyes of many Americans 
and people around the world. Many 
people are seeing more clearly—some 
perhaps for the first time in their 
lives—the extent to which injustice has 
embedded itself in parts of America. 
We see how some of our laws and in-
stitutions don’t match our stated and 
professed belief that all men and 
women are created equal and endowed 
with the same inalienable rights. 
Later today, John Lewis will make 
his last departure from the U.S. Cap-
itol. He is going home after a long and 
noble life of service, a life that has 
helped us to live up to our ideals. How 
often did we hear John Lewis say: 
When young people tell me that noth-
ing has changed, I tell them to come 
walk in my shoes. 
He was so right. America is different 
and America is better because of the 
enormous sacrifice and courage of men 
like John Lewis, Reverend C.T. Vivian, 
who passed away, as well, last week; 
Joseph Lowery; Mamie Till; Martin Lu-
ther King; Coretta Scott King; Rosa 
Parks; Daisy Bates; Julian Bond; Bay-
ard Rustin; Elijah Cummings; and, of 
course, my friend and the current 
House Democratic Whip, JAMES CLY-
BURN, and so many other leaders of our 
modern civil rights movement—just 
too many to name. 
We are a more perfect union today 
because so many ordinary men and 
women and children whose names are 
mostly forgotten by history risked 
their lives for dignity and democracy 
in little towns like Selma and Bir-
mingham, AL, and Chicago’s Mar-
quette Park neighborhood. 
Thank goodness we are better, but 
the work of true justice and equality is 
far from over. We know that. A month 
before he died, John Lewis spoke out 
about how he was moved to see so 
many 
people 
from 
different 
back-
grounds marching together for racial 
justice and healing. Most Americans 
today 
are 
appalled—almost 
incred-
ulous—that only decades ago young 
people like John Lewis and Diane Nash 
were accosted by angry mobs simply 
for having the audacity—the audac-
ity—to sit at a Whites-only lunch 
counter or ride on a segregated bus. 
We reject racism as individuals, but 
many of us are only beginning to un-
derstand the existence of the corrosive 
consequences of the system of racial 
injustice. This national reckoning on 
race in which we are now engaged is 
helping us to see more clearly how old, 
discredited ideas about race, which 
have been rejected by most, still linger 
in the minds of many individuals, re-
gardless of the laws that have been 
passed. 
I believe that most Americans be-
lieve very deeply in fairness. It is one 
of our defining values as a people. I 
also believe Maya Angelou was right 
when she said: 
Do the best you can until you know better. 
Then when you know better, do better. 
How can we do better to reduce sys-
temic racial injustice and heal the 
wounds and divisions that false notions 
of racial superiority have caused in our 
Nation and our fellow citizens? As 
John Lewis told us often, achieving 
great, genuine equality is the work of a 
lifetime. Let me suggest briefly a few 
ways that this Senate can begin that 
work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4529 
July 28, 2020 
First—and this is so easy and obvi-
ous—let the Senate debate and vote on 
the Justice in Policing Act. The Presi-
dent can send unidentified Federal 
agents to as many cities as he likes, 
but the calls for justice in our streets 
will not end until we make a clear 
stand against policing tactics that 
killed George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, 
Tamir Rice, Laquan McDonald, and too 
many other men, women, and children 
of color in America. 
Our Republican colleagues acknowl-
edged the need for policing reforms 
when they brought up the bill that in-
cluded certain changes, but the bill did 
not proceed, and it should. This Senate 
can—and must—do better. This belief 
is shared by an overwhelming majority 
of civil rights organizations in our Na-
tion. 
The Justice in Policing Act is spon-
sored by Senators KAMALA HARRIS and 
CORY BOOKER. It has passed the House 
of Representatives, and I am proud to 
be a cosponsor. 
The House, in passing its version 
with a bipartisan vote, gave us an op-
portunity, I say to Senator MCCON-
NELL, to debate the Justice in Policing 
Act, which passed the House, and here 
in the Senate we should. 
Second, let this Senate debate the 
Economic Justice Act that has been of-
fered by Senator SCHUMER. 
Third, Martin Luther King called ra-
cial disparities in healthcare one of the 
most shocking of all racial injustices. 
It was more than 50 years ago when he 
said. Yet the disparities persist to this 
day and may be worse in many ways. 
This pandemic has laid them bare for 
us to see. Black and Brown Americans 
are three times more likely to become 
infected with coronavirus than White 
Americans and twice as likely to die 
from COVID–19. 
The Affordable Care Act has done 
more to reduce racial disparities in 
healthcare than almost any act since 
the creation of Medicaid. It is hard to 
believe that there are many on the 
other side still trying to kill the Af-
fordable Care Act in the midst of a pan-
demic that has already taken the lives 
of 145,000 Americans. Many more have 
been sickened, and it is still burning 
out of control in large parts of our Na-
tion. Think about what it would be if 
we had no Affordable Care Act and dou-
bled the number of uninsured people in 
this country. How could that bring us 
any consolation or confidence that we 
can continue to fight this battle? 
For the sake of African Americans, 
Latinx Americans, and all Americans 
who rely on the affordable coverage 
and patient protections, it is time to 
put an end to this endless assault on 
the Affordable Care Act. 
I hope my colleagues—especially my 
colleagues 
who 
speak 
passionately 
about protecting mothers and babies— 
will join me in passing a bill I have in-
troduced to reduce the shocking high 
rate of maternal and infant mortality 
among African-American women and 
their babies. It is inexplicable that in 
the United States of America, we see so 
many Black women dying in childbirth 
and so many babies dying as well. It is 
unnecessary. It is time for us to focus 
the great resources, health resources, 
of America on this issue. 
In America, a woman of color is three 
to four times more likely than a White 
woman to die as a result of pregnancy. 
Why? The answers are very obvious. We 
need better, more focused, more under-
standing medical care. I am sad to say 
that in Illinois, the situation—the 
numbers—are that bad, if not even 
worse. 
The United States is 1 of only 13 na-
tions in the world in which the mater-
nal mortality rate is worse than it was 
25 years ago. In the United States of 
America, we are 1 of only 13 nations in 
which the maternal death rate is worse 
today than what it was 25 years ago. 
How in the world can we explain that? 
I have introduced a bill called the 
MOMMA Act. My companion in this ef-
fort is my Congresswoman from Chi-
cago, ROBIN KELLY. Let’s get that de-
bated, I say to Senator MCCONNELL. It 
will not take long. I bet it passes eas-
ily. We owe it to many across America 
to show the initiative and to bring it to 
the floor. 
Fourth, because our friends across 
the aisle could not agree among them-
selves on what would be in the next 
coronavirus relief bill, critical protec-
tions included in the CARES Act have 
now or will soon expire without re-
placement. 
These protections include payments 
for the jobless for tens of millions of 
Americans who have lost their jobs in 
this pandemic—it wasn’t because they 
were lazy; it was bad luck—as well as 
the Federal moratorium on evictions 
for families who have had difficulty 
paying their rent because of economic 
devastation brought on by COVID–19. 
Unless we extend this moratorium, as 
many as 28 million could lose their 
homes in the next 3 months. I can’t 
imagine the devastation that would 
bring to a family—losing your home 
and perhaps having no place to turn. 
For the sake of those families and for 
our ability to fight this virus, we must 
extend the moratorium on evictions 
and help families who are struggling to 
pay rent. 
Senator WARREN
introduced a bill 
that I have cosponsored to extend this 
critical moratorium through March. It 
is called the Protecting Renters from 
Evictions and Fees Act. 
I am proud to cosponsor a bill with 
Senator BROWN that provides $100 bil-
lion in emergency rental assistance to 
help families and individuals pay their 
rent. Let’s keep these families in a 
safe, quality living environment. 
The 
crisis 
of 
affordable 
housing 
didn’t start with this pandemic. The 
shortage of safe, affordable public 
housing has been building for decades, 
and it disproportionately harms Afri-
can-American families. 
Senator HARRIS of California has in-
troduced a bill, which I am proud to co-
sponsor, called the Housing is Infra-
structure Act. It would invest $100 bil-
lion to repair our current stock of pub-
lic housing and to build new units of 
safe, affordable public housing. 
I could just walk you through a map 
of the State of Illinois and the public 
housing I have visited and witnessed 
that is in desperate need of repair. It is 
time, you think, to call the landlord 
and say: What are you going to do 
about this housing unit that you own 
that is falling down? Except, it turns 
out, we are the landlords. The Federal 
Government owns this property. The 
Federal Government has the responsi-
bility to fix it. 
Last week, President Trump moved 
to repeal an Obama-era rule meant to 
ban discriminatory housing and zoning 
laws and policies. It is not pricing from 
this President, but it is wrong. We need 
to move forward and not backward. 
The housing infrastructure needs to 
move in the right direction. 
Finally, once again, in the name of 
John Lewis, I believe that the right to 
vote was ‘‘almost sacred,’’ in his words, 
and I share that feeling, but that right 
is now threatened by a series of mis-
guided decisions in recent years by the 
Supreme Court and other courts. 
The House passed a bill last year to 
restore the Voting Rights Act to its 
original intent. That bill is being re-
introduced in the Senate this week by 
Senator LEAHY and in the House by 
Congressman CLYBURN. The difference? 
They are naming it in honor of Con-
gressman John Lewis. 
John Lewis did not risk his life in 
Selma and so many other places so peo-
ple would praise him in speeches or 
name things after him. He did not risk 
his life for the right to have a bridge 
named after him—although it is a fit-
ting tribute. He risked his life over and 
over again to protect the right of every 
American to vote. 
Americans’ faith in our electoral sys-
tem—the cornerstone of our democ-
racy—continues to be under attack by 
entities that wish us ill. 
For those who gathered in the Ro-
tunda yesterday to honor his memory 
and to stand in silent respect for all 
the work of his life, I say to my fellow 
Senators who were there: Let us pass 
the Voting Rights Advancement Act in 
the name of Congressman John Lewis. 
Let us make it clear that his life was 
worth this and so much more. 
When you know better, you do better. 
Our eyes have been opened, and now it 
is time for us to act. 
It is my honor to serve in this Sen-
ate, but I am sorry to say that when it 
comes to production of important, 
meaningful legislation, this institution 
has fallen far behind. 
We seldom take up bills of great im-
portance 
and 
magnitude. 
We 
just 
passed the Defense authorization bill— 
a very important piece of legislation, 
which I believe has passed for 59 
straight years in Congress, and I am 
glad it passed again, but now you see 
an empty floor and an empty Chamber

S4530 
July 28, 2020 
where we are not taking up the issues 
that we should. 
There is one person who controls the 
agenda and the schedule of this Cham-
ber, and that is the Republican major-
ity leader, Senator MITCH MCCONNELL 
of Kentucky. Let’s not waste this op-
portunity to make America a better 
place. Let’s do things that make a dif-
ference. 
America is counting on us in the 
midst of this massive health crisis with 
COVID–19—perhaps the worst health 
crisis our Nation has faced in over 100 
years. With the state of our economy 
and so many—tens of millions of people 
out of work, shouldn’t we be acting to-
gether on a bipartisan basis, as we did 
in March of this year, to pass legisla-
tion? 
The reports we have is that the other 
side of the aisle is in disarray. I might 
remind Senator MCCONNELL that the 
best legislation that passes here is bi-
partisan. And this measure, COVID re-
lief, moving forward, should be bipar-
tisan as well. For it to be bipartisan, 
we need people of both parties to sit 
down together and negotiate. That has 
to continue, along with the participa-
tion of the White House, in order to 
achieve these goals. 
First and foremost, we need to re-
store unemployment assistance to the 
millions of families who will see it end 
in just a few days. I cannot imagine 
having lost your job, worried about 
whether there is another one waiting 
or whether one will be available, and 
then having to worry about whether 
you can make that rent payment, the 
mortgage payment, the utility bills, 
food, health insurance—the basics—and 
to be told that Congress just let unem-
ployment assistance expire, which hap-
pens in just 3 days. What are these 
families going to do? 
I sincerely hope that every Member 
of the Senate will reach out to one of 
these unemployed families and listen 
quietly to their stories. I have seen 
them as they come to the food pan-
tries. I have seen them come and ask 
for help, which they never dreamed 
they would have to do. It must be 
heartbreaking to go through that expe-
rience. Let’s stand by them now. They 
need us now more than ever. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yester-
day, I was privileged to be able to pay 
my respects to Representative John 
Lewis as he lay in state in the Capitol 
Rotunda—a fitting place for an Amer-
ican hero. 
His death is a loss, but his dauntless 
courage 
and 
deep 
conviction 
have 
carved out for him a permanent place 
in American history. When we tell sto-
ries of those who have made America 
greater, John Lewis’s name will always 
be among them. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yester-
day, Senate Republicans introduced 
the next phase of our coronavirus relief 
effort, the Health, Economic Assist-
ance, Liability Protection, and Schools 
Act, or the HEALS Act. 
This bill has been carefully targeted 
to address the most pressing issues fac-
ing our Nation right now: getting kids 
back to school, getting workers back 
to work, and ensuring that we have the 
healthcare resources necessary to de-
feat the virus. 
The HEALS Act will provide eco-
nomic incentives to help businesses re-
tain workers. It will give additional 
support to hard-hit small businesses. It 
will provide checks to American fami-
lies to help them weather the economic 
challenges that they are facing. It will 
give schools more than $100 billion to 
help them safely reopen so kids and 
college students aren’t missing out on 
the academic, social, and emotional 
benefits of in-person learning. 
It will direct funds to diagnosis, vac-
cines, and treatments. It will ensure 
that medical professionals, small busi-
nesses, and school districts doing their 
best to protect Americans don’t face 
frivolous lawsuits from predatory trial 
lawyers. 
It will provide incentives for manu-
facturing personal protective equip-
ment in the United States to help en-
sure that we never again face the kinds 
of shortages we have seen with the 
coronavirus. And more. 
Now it is time for Democrats to come 
to the negotiating table so that we can 
arrive at a bipartisan bill and get this 
relief into the hands of Americans. I 
was disappointed to hear of the Demo-
cratic leader’s partisan screeds yester-
day and today on the Senate floor, al-
though I did appreciate his ability to— 
with a straight face, I might add—si-
multaneously characterize Republican 
relief efforts as insufficient while tout-
ing a House bill that mentions the 
word ‘‘cannabis’’ more often than the 
word ‘‘job’’ and actually contains less 
money for schools than the Republican 
bill. 
No one is going to get everything 
they want with this bill, and Demo-
crats are not going to be able to imple-
ment their socialist wish list, but if we 
work together, we can get real relief 
into the hands of Americans. I hope the 
Democrats will join us. 
f 
REMOTE AND MOBILE WORKER 
RELIEF ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, during 
New York’s toughest moments during 
the pandemic, medical professionals 
from around the country came to hard- 
hit New York City to help. They 
formed an essential part of the city’s 
medical response, and they undoubt-
edly saved lives. They are deserving of 
New York’s profound gratitude—and 
apparently of something else: tax bills. 
That is right. In May, New York Gov-
ernor Andrew Cuomo announced that 
New York would be levying income tax 
on any money these medical profes-
sionals made while they were there. 
Now, individuals can generally re-
ceive a tax credit in their home State 
for income tax paid to another State, 
thus avoiding double taxation of their 
income, but since New York has one of 
the highest income taxes in the coun-
try, a lot of these medical professionals 
will be facing a higher than normal tax 
bill on any money they earn in New 
York. The situation is even worse for 
residents of States without an income 
tax, like my home State of South Da-
kota. Medical professionals from those 
States will simply have to absorb the 
full cost of this unexpected bill. 
The healthcare workers who traveled 
to New York are not alone in facing a 
complicated tax situation. For Ameri-
cans who regularly spend limited time 
working in different States throughout 
the year, the situation can be even 
worse. A traveling nurse, for example, 
or a corporate trainer might work in 
not just one but several additional 
States during a given year, and navi-
gating the resulting income tax situa-
tion can be incredibly complicated. 
Some States, like New York, aggres-
sively tax individuals they deem to 
have earned income within their bor-
ders, even if the income in question is 
just the salary they earned from their 
employer 
while 
attending 
a 
2-day 
training conference in the State. Other 
States allow nonresidents to work for 
longer periods—as long as 60 days in 
some cases—before they require an in-
dividual to file an income tax return. 
Navigating different States’ require-
ments can be a real burden for both 
employees and employers and can dis-
courage interstate commerce. It is par-
ticularly challenging for small busi-
nesses, which frequently lack the in- 
house tax staff and tracking capabili-
ties of larger organizations. 
This situation cries out for a solu-
tion. For the past four Congresses, I 
have introduced legislation—the Mo-
bile Workforce State Income Tax Sim-
plification Act—to create a uniform 
standard for mobile workers. Under my 
bill, if you spent 30 days or fewer work-
ing in a different State, you would be 
taxed as normal by your home State. If 
you spent more than 30 days working 
in a different State, you would be sub-
ject to that other State’s income tax in 
addition to the income tax in your 
home State. Having a universal rule 
like this would make life a lot easier 
for workers and for employers. 
In June I introduced an updated 
version of my mobile workforce bill— 
the Remote and Mobile Worker Relief 
Act, which I am pleased to announce

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4531 
July 28, 2020 
has been included in the HEALS Act, 
the phase 4 coronavirus relief package 
the Republicans introduced yesterday. 
Like my original mobile workforce 
bill, the Remote and Mobile Worker 
Relief Act would create a uniform, 30- 
day standard governing State income 
tax liability for mobile workers, but 
my new bill goes further and addresses 
some of the particular challenges faced 
by mobile and remote workers as a re-
sult of the coronavirus. 
The Remote and Mobile Worker Re-
lief Act would establish a special 90- 
day standard for healthcare workers 
who travel to another State to help 
during the pandemic. This should en-
sure that no healthcare worker faces 
an unexpected tax bill for the contribu-
tions he or she makes to fighting the 
coronavirus. 
My new bill also addresses the pos-
sible tax complications that could face 
remote workers as a result of the pan-
demic. During the coronavirus crisis, 
many workers who usually travel to 
their offices every day have ended up 
working 
from 
home. 
This 
doesn’t 
present a tax problem for most employ-
ees, but it does present a possible prob-
lem for workers who live in a different 
State than the one in which they work. 
Workers who live in a different State 
from the one in which they work are 
subject to income tax from both 
States, but under current State tax 
laws, they usually pay most or all of 
their State income taxes to the State 
in which they earn their income rather 
than their State of residence. However, 
now that some workers who usually 
work in a different State have been 
working from home, there is a risk 
that their State of residence could con-
sider the resulting income as allocated 
to and taxable by it as well. That could 
mean a higher tax bill for a lot of 
workers. 
My bill would preempt this problem 
by codifying the pre-pandemic status 
quo. Under my bill, if you plan to work 
in North Carolina but had to work 
from home in South Carolina during 
the pandemic, your income would still 
be taxed as if you were going into the 
office in North Carolina every day, just 
as it would have been if the pandemic 
had never happened. 
Relief for mobile workers is a bipar-
tisan idea. A version of my original 
mobile workforce bill has passed the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
multiple 
times, and the only reason it hasn’t ad-
vanced so far in the Senate is because 
of the opposition of a handful of States 
that aggressively tax—you have got 
it—temporary workers. 
Now that the pandemic has high-
lighted the challenges facing mobile 
workers and the potential challenges 
facing remote workers, I am pleased 
that my legislation will be considered 
here in the Senate as part of the broad-
er coronavirus relief package that we 
hope to pass in the next couple of 
weeks. I am grateful to Chairman 
GRASSLEY for his support for this legis-
lation. 
It 
is 
unconscionable—unconscion-
able—that we would allow healthcare 
workers who risked their own lives to 
care for individuals in coronavirus- 
stricken States to be punished with un-
expected tax bills. We need to make 
sure that Americans who work from 
home to help slow the spread of the 
virus don’t face a complicated tax situ-
ation or an unexpectedly high tax bill 
as a result. 
Americans have faced enough chal-
lenges over the past several months. 
Let’s make sure tax problems are not 
among them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this 
afternoon to talk about long-term care 
and a number of related challenges 
that confront our country, especially 
at this time. 
One of the most horrific numbers in 
all of the horror that we have seen in 
the aftermath of the onset of the virus 
and COVID–19 disease and the jobs and 
economic crisis that have followed it is 
the number of deaths in long-term care 
settings. 
When you combine the deaths of resi-
dents in nursing homes and other simi-
lar settings—sometimes called long- 
term care or even congregate set-
tings—with the deaths of workers, we 
know that the number now exceeds 
59,000 Americans. About 40 percent of 
all the deaths are either a resident of a 
long-term care facility or a worker in 
those facilities. 
So we are talking about those Ameri-
cans today—those families—when we 
consider what we do next because no 
one here, I don’t think—I don’t care 
what side of the aisle, what point of 
view, who you are, what State you are 
from, no one in this body or in the 
House would want to accept the idea 
that, say, 4 months from today, or 5 
months or 6 months, another 59,000 or 
60,000 people will have died in those 
settings. 
We know a lot about how to get those 
numbers down. It is not one of those 
things where we can throw up our 
hands and say there is little that we 
can do. There is a lot we can do be-
cause Americans are smart, innovative, 
and caring, and a lot of smart people 
have figured out how to get those num-
bers down. 
So 59,000—more than 59,000—Ameri-
cans is unacceptable. Also, 40 percent 
of all the deaths going forward is also 
unacceptable. About a month ago, I 
came to the floor with some of my col-
leagues, and we pressed for a vote on 
the solutions we need to save lives in 
nursing homes and also protect the 
workforce. The majority blocked the 
vote. Since then, the Senate has done 
nothing when it comes to this issue 
that has impacted so many families 
and so many communities. We have a 
chance now. 
I realize sometimes when a bill gets 
blocked that that isn’t the end of the 
story and that the individual or the 
party blocking might have a different 
idea, a better idea, a different solution, 
a better approach. If that is the case 
with the majority, we need to hear it. 
I would hope that a solution, a remedy, 
a strategy to get the 59,000-death num-
ber down would include the resources 
to do it because this isn’t a cir-
cumstance where you can just wish it 
away. This isn’t a circumstance where 
you can just move a little bit of policy 
around. We need resources, and I will 
talk more about them. 
We know that yesterday Senate Re-
publicans released their plan for the 
next piece of legislation relating to 
COVID–19 and the economy. This pro-
posal is 2 months—a full 2 months— 
after the House passed the Heroes Act 
to bring relief to the millions of Ameri-
cans who are suffering, families who 
are suffering, not only in the context of 
long-term care—having lost a loved 
one, a resident, or a worker in their 
family—but they are suffering for 
other reasons as well. 
We know the unemployment rate is 
intolerably too high. In my home State 
of Pennsylvania—just imagine this— 
the number was 1-plus million people 
out of work in April. Thankfully, that 
number went down in the month of 
May, but it only went down to 849,000 
people out of work. 
I was hoping, as I know everyone was 
in the State, that the June number 
would fall precipitously and maybe by 
the same percentage, so 849,000 people 
would go well into the 700s and maybe 
even into the 600,000s and would keep 
going down from there. Unfortunately, 
in the month of June, it went from 
849,000 to about 821,000 people out of 
work. I don’t think I have seen unem-
ployment numbers like that in my 
home State in my lifetime. 
The 13.4 percent unemployment in 
May dropped but only went down to 13 
percent. Just by way of comparison, in 
the great recession of just roughly a 
decade ago, Pennsylvania’s unemploy-
ment rate went way up, as it did in a 
lot of other States. It stopped at 10 per-
cent. Some counties were above 10 per-
cent, 11 percent, 12 percent or higher. 
Statewide, it never really went above 
10 percent. 
We are now in our third month of un-
employment rates well above 10 per-
cent. It was 16 percent in April, almost 
13.5 percent in May, and now 13 percent 
exactly now. We have a lot of work to 
do. 
For purposes of today’s discussion, I 
wanted to talk about what we can do in 
the long-term care context. The Repub-
lican proposal of yesterday makes no

meaningful investment to save lives in 
nursing homes. The policies that ad-
dress long-term care in this proposal 
are insufficient. I think that is an un-
derstatement, but I will let that go for 
now. 
There is no investment in home and 
community-based services, and there is 
no funding to reward the heroes on the 
frontlines. Some people might say: 
What do you mean by home and com-
munity-based services? I don’t under-
stand that. I am not sure what you 
mean. 
We know that in the United States 
we have a number of settings where 
care is delivered—care for older citi-
zens, older Americans, and care for 
people with disabilities. In the nursing 
home context, of course, that is skilled 
care in a facility, in a so-called con-
gregate setting. Depending on which 
number you believe, in the United 
States we have between 1.3 and 1.5 mil-
lion Americans there. We also have a 
lot of Americans who are getting their 
care—very important care for a senior 
or for someone with a disability—in a 
home setting or in a community-based 
setting, but the funding doesn’t flow in 
that direction very often. So we are 
trying to change that because, obvi-
ously, if you are an older American, 
you might have certain conditions that 
make you even more susceptible, more 
vulnerable in the context of COVID–19. 
In many cases, it will be preferable to 
have you in a home setting or commu-
nity-based setting. 
But if you are in those settings, we 
have to invest in the workers who do 
that heroic work in both nursing 
homes, in homes, and in community- 
based settings, because the care is not 
going to be what it needs to be if we 
are not helping the workforce. I think 
most people agree with that. 
Just as we cannot allow another 3 or 
4 months to go by with 59,000 people 
dying, we also cannot allow the con-
flict here in the Senate to stop us from 
making progress in long-term care. We 
have to help nursing homes at the 
same time as we demand more of them. 
We need to invest in what we know 
works. 
I have a bill, S. 3768, introduced with 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. The name of the 
bill is the Nursing Home COVID–19 
Protection and Prevention Act. It 
would dedicate $20 billion in emergency 
funding for proven practices. We would 
spend $20 billion to get that death 
number down and also to get the case 
number down. 
We are concerned, as well, about the 
high number of cases. We need to in-
vest in best practices that some long- 
term care settings were investing in 
way back in early March, and some 
long-term care facilities got much bet-
ter results. They had fewer cases and 
lower numbers of deaths because they 
were investing in these best practices. 
But to invest $20 billion in emergency 
funding for these proven best practices, 
I think, is a bargain to get the death 
number down and get the case number 
down. 
This bill will help nursing homes be-
come a lot better and become more 
proficient 
at 
a 
practice 
called 
cohorting. It is real simple. That just 
means separating people in the nursing 
home. You separate the residents with 
COVID–19 from the residents who don’t 
have it. When that basic practice is in 
place and when it is operative, it is 
something that a lot of places need 
help with. There are, obviously, costs 
involved in that. There may be costs 
because you have to do retrofitting. 
There may be costs in terms of needing 
additional staff. 
But that is only part of it. The bill 
also allows nursing homes to provide 
for their workers, these heroes who are 
on the frontlines every day. Obviously, 
if you are on the frontlines every day, 
you are an essential worker. There are 
all these phrases and descriptions of 
these workers. Those who are at the 
front of the frontline are those in 
healthcare, because they are not only 
going out every day and providing an 
essential service, but they are closest 
to the risk. That includes folks who 
work in hospitals and other settings, of 
course. That is for certain. But it also 
includes people who work in nursing 
homes and at home and in community- 
based service settings. 
Those are folks whom we call heroes, 
and it is nice to call them heroes. It is 
nice to say they are doing great work. 
It is nice to pat them on the back, but 
what we should be doing is paying 
them more for the sacrifice they make 
for the country. 
The analogy, of course, is the GI bill. 
I have a bill that would add similar 
education benefits to those frontline 
workers, those heroes. 
But at a minimum, they should get 
premium pay and overtime pay. They 
should also have essential benefits, and 
we should help them with childcare. 
You can’t say: You have got to be on 
the frontlines; you have got to be on 
the front of the front lines, and you 
have to go to work every day because 
we need your essential skilled work to 
care for the most vulnerable, but you 
are on your own with childcare. Good 
luck. 
We haven’t done much to help them 
with that. 
My bill also includes strong resident 
protections—‘‘resident’’ meaning resi-
dents of nursing homes—to prevent 
evictions to homeless shelters and to 
provide an extra check on nursing 
home quality. 
All these things I just recited in the 
bill, the Republican proposal doesn’t 
have. I think the time is long overdue 
for Congress to take action to deal 
with what can only be described as an 
American 
tragedy—a 
preventable 
American 
tragedy. 
No 
one 
would 
argue—I certainly would not argue— 
that the 59,000-plus number could be 
zero. It is not what we are saying. 
What we are saying is you can bring 
the number down. If we bring the num-
ber down, even a little bit, it is worth 
it to save lives and to reduce the num-
ber of cases, but I think we can do a lot 
better than that. 
Last week, a coalition made up of 
representatives from the nursing home 
industry, direct service professionals, 
AARP, the Alzheimer’s Association, 
Catholic Charities, The Arc, and the 
Service Employees International Union 
came together to write to Senate lead-
ership to demand this action and more. 
Think about that group. That is not a 
group that is always on the same page. 
They have often direct conflicts on a 
lot of issues, but they have all come to-
gether to support the residents in nurs-
ing homes and those in other settings 
and the workers because that is how 
dire it is. Groups that are often in con-
flict on legislation are together on 
this. Here is part of what they wrote to 
the Senate leadership: ‘‘The urgent 
need to save lives, prevent the spread 
of the virus, and address the services 
and support older adults and people 
with disabilities need cannot be over-
stated.’’ 
In addition to nursing home sup-
ports, this coalition called for dedi-
cated funds for home and community- 
based services under Medicaid that I 
described earlier. I have a bill to do 
that. The House-passed Heroes Act, in 
fact, does that. The Heroes Act passed 
2 months ago, and here we are without 
a bill ready to vote on in the Senate. 
I sent a letter with 28 of my col-
leagues 
yesterday 
to 
urge 
Leader 
MCCONNELL to move these policies for-
ward. We know that over 2.5 million 
older adults and people with disabil-
ities depend on these services to be 
able to continue living in their own 
homes. These 2.5 million seniors and 
people with disabilities are folks who 
are not in a nursing home or other con-
gregate setting. They are, by defini-
tion, in their homes or in a commu-
nity-based setting. They are receiving 
their supports and services in their 
homes, where they are less likely to be 
exposed to the virus and often are able 
to see their families. 
Just to give you one example, there 
is Michelle Mitchell of Allentown, 
PA—on the eastern side of our State, 
almost at the New Jersey border. 
Michelle is a person who benefits from 
the services. She has a lifelong dis-
ability—cerebral palsy—which affects 
the use of her arms and legs. She holds 
multiple degrees and is a full-time fac-
ulty member at a local college. 
Every single day, Michelle Mitchell 
has the benefit of a personal care at-
tendant who helps Michelle get out of 
bed, helps her to bathe, helps her to 
dress, and helps her to eat. Without 
Medicaid home and community-based 
services, thousands of people with simi-
lar needs to Michelle would not be able 
to live at home and work and interact 
with neighbors and friends. Home and 
community-based 
services 
keep 
Michelle safe, they keep her healthy, 
and they keep her engaged. 
But the agencies that provide these 
vital services are facing barriers. A

July 28, 2020 
services providers conducted by the 
group ANCOR found that 68 percent of 
providers have had to close some of 
their services to people with intellec-
tual or developmental disabilities. This 
same survey found that over half of the 
agencies had faced significant addi-
tional expenses because of pandemic 
expense. 
We know that life has changed for so 
many Americans and so many institu-
tions. This is one of these agencies that 
do such good work. Some of the ex-
penses they face include increased lev-
els of overtime, purchases of personal 
protective equipment, and additional 
training for workers. Perhaps most un-
settling is that the agencies that pro-
vide essential services to older adults 
and people with disabilities don’t have 
sufficient funding to keep offering 
services for more than 1 month if pay-
ments stop. This lack of cash on hand 
illustrates how fragile the home and 
community-based services system is. 
Yesterday morning, administrators 
in Pennsylvania said that if home and 
community-based services were not 
available, thousands of additional peo-
ple would need to enter nursing homes, 
which again, is a congregate setting, 
where the likelihood of contracting the 
virus is higher than a lot of other set-
tings. That, of course, would put them 
at greater risk of contracting the virus 
and much greater risk of dying because 
of this horrible pandemic. 
When we talk about investing in 
home and community-based services, 
that is tied to the goal of getting not 
just the case number down but the 
death number down. 
The proposal by Republicans yester-
day makes clear that they are not fo-
cused on this crisis. There is no invest-
ment in home and community-based 
services at all. The response to nursing 
homes is wholly insufficient. The level 
of funding provided in the proposal, in 
my judgment, is an insult to older 
Americans. It is an insult to people 
with disabilities and their families, and 
it is an insult to the workers who sup-
port them. Claiming that people with 
disabilities and seniors are supported 
in this legislation is just not true. 
On top of the lack of funding, the bill 
blows a hole in the protections pro-
vided by the ADA, or the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, for people with 
disabilities. To ensure that seniors and 
people with disabilities are kept safe 
and healthy during this public health 
crisis, we need to ensure that strong 
policies are in place to keep nursing 
homes safe, and we need to ensure that 
there is dedicated funding for home and 
community-based services. 
I am calling for an investment in 
both settings—home and community- 
based services—for seniors and people 
with disabilities, as well as invest-
ments in proven strategies that we 
know will help nursing homes and also 
get the death numbers down. To meet 
our responsibilities to those who are 
most at risk—the most vulnerable 
among us—the Senate should include 
these provisions that I have described 
in the next COVID–19 legislation.

Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, there is 
one more item to address before I relin-
quish the microphone. 
We know that yesterday was the 30th 
anniversary of the signing of the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act, to which I 
just referred—the so-called ADA. This 
is legislation that Congress should be 
very proud of because of how much it 
has ensured that millions of Americans 
with disabilities have been able to ex-
ercise their rights as Americans. We 
still have some work to do on the goals 
of the ADA, but it is a good anniver-
sary to remember and to celebrate. So, 
in honor of the anniversary, I offer this 
resolution to celebrate the 30th anni-
versary of the signing of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. Res. 661, a resolution 
recognizing the importance of inde-
pendent living for individuals with dis-
abilities made possible by the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and 
calling for further action to strengthen 
home and community living for indi-
viduals with disabilities, which was 
submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 661) recognizing the 
importance of independent living for individ-
uals with disabilities made possible by the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and 
calling for further action to strengthen home 
and community living for individuals with 
disabilities. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. CASEY. I know of no further de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate on the resolution? 
Hearing none, the question is on 
agreeing to the resolution. 
The resolution (S. Res. 661) was 
agreed to. 
Mr. CASEY. I further ask unanimous 
consent that the preamble be agreed to 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I con-
gratulate our friend from Pennsylvania 
who has demonstrated that bipartisan-
ship is not dead in the U.S. Congress. 
In fact, I learned a long time ago that 
bipartisanship, collegiality, and co-
operation don’t really make much 
news, so people do get sort of a 
misimpression sometimes as to how 
Congress functions. Let me just say 
there are plenty of people on both sides 
of the aisle who are actually interested 
in solving some of our Nation’s biggest 
problems. 
Again, 
they 
aren’t 
nec-
essarily the ones you see on cable news 
or grabbing the headlines, but they are 
doing important work. I am proud to 
be part of a body that does bipartisan 
work and solves problems in working 
together. 
f 
HURRICANE HANNA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
weekend, as Texans continued to battle 
COVID–19, those in parts of the State 
came to face with another disaster at 
the same time. It just seems like the 
challenges keep coming. First, we are 
in a pandemic. Then George Floyd lost 
his life unnecessarily and raised our 
consciousness to the racial injustice 
that still exists in this country. Then 
we had a natural disaster like a hurri-
cane. Hurricane Hanna made landfall 
in South Texas and brought heavy 
rains and high winds to communities 
that were already grappling with the 
pandemic, especially the Rio Grande 
Valley. 
On 
Sunday, 
nearly 
300,000 
homes were without power in South 
Texas, and power is still being restored 
in a number of those communities. 
Navigating dangerous floodwaters and 
downed power lines is difficult under 
normal circumstances, and when you 
add a highly contagious virus to the 
mix, as you can imagine, it presents a 
host of logistical challenges. 
I first thank the first responders and 
emergency crews who have been work-
ing overtime these last few days to get 
our neighbors to safety and to restore 
their power as quickly as possible. 
There is a strong sense of community 
in South Texas and the Rio Grande 
Valley, and I have no doubt these com-
munities will pull together and come 
out of this crisis stronger than before. 
I have been talking to a number of 
the leaders in several of the counties 
that have been affected, and we will 
continue working with them to ensure 
they have the resources they need to 
sustain their response and recovery ef-
forts in the short term and address 
those critical infrastructure needs in 
the long term. 
I have also heard from a number of 
farmers, ranchers, and agricultural 
producers whose crops have been flood-
ed, and I expect to hear more in the 
coming days about how we might be 
helpful, especially, again, in this al-
ready challenging time.

HEALS ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I 
said, the number of COVID–19 cases has 
surged in recent weeks in the Rio 
Grande 
Valley, 
South 
Texas, 
and 
throughout the State as well. Just a 
couple of weeks ago, Texas reported 
more than 10,000 new cases in a single 
day, and that happened 5 days in a row. 
It certainly was a wake-up call for 
many who had not had taken the most 
effective precautions seriously—things 
like social distancing, good personal 
hygiene, the wearing of masks if you 
can’t socially distance, and staying 
home if you are sick. It is amazing 
what we can do as individuals to stop 
the spread of this virus by doing those 
simple things. Unfortunately, some 
people let their guard down and didn’t 
follow those protocols, so we saw a 
huge uptick in the number of cases. 
Thankfully, though, I think the mes-
sage has been received and understood, 
and we have recently seen a gradual 
and encouraging decline in cases. 
Yet, as the war against COVID–19 
wages on, we can’t afford to lose any 
additional ground whether from a pub-
lic health perspective or from an eco-
nomic recovery perspective. So I be-
lieve it is time for Congress to pass ad-
ditional legislation to strengthen our 
fight. That is why my colleagues and I 
introduced the HEALS Act yesterday. 
This legislation builds on the signifi-
cant progress we have made already in 
four bipartisan bills that have already 
passed the Congress and have been 
signed into law by President Trump 
that will sustain our effort to defeat 
this virus and recover economically. 
This legislation will ensure that 
workers who had the rug pulled out 
from under them earlier this year will 
continue to receive enhanced unem-
ployment benefits. 
It will provide funding to help K–12 
schools, colleges, and universities safe-
ly and effectively educate their stu-
dents this fall whether that means 
there being a combination of online or 
in-person instruction. 
It will send additional and needed as-
sistance to our farmers, ranchers, and 
producers who are keeping our families 
fed in the midst of the pandemic, and it 
will give States and local governments 
the flexibility they have requested and 
that they need to use CARES Act fund-
ing where it is needed the most. 
In the coming days, I will talk more 
about how this legislation supports the 
workers and institutions that have 
been hit the hardest by this virus, but, 
today, I would like to focus on the 
ways it bolsters our fight against the 
virus itself. 
One of the most important ways we 
can do that is through testing. The 
ability to identify positive cases as 
early as possible is the key to stopping 
the spread of the virus. Yet, as we have 
learned, there are massive numbers of 
people who have the virus who don’t 
even know it and don’t experience any 
symptoms. In short, they don’t even 
feel sick. What we have seen, whether 
it be in multigenerational households 
or with the people who are most vul-
nerable to this virus—mainly, the el-
derly and the people with underlying 
health problems—is that they cannot 
be properly isolated unless we can iden-
tify the people who are carrying the 
virus even though they themselves 
may not be suffering any symptoms. 
The first coronavirus package we 
passed made testing free. It removed 
the cost barrier that could prevent 
those who needed a test from receiving 
one. At the time, if you were asymp-
tomatic, the CDC—Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention—didn’t rec-
ommend your getting a test. Some of 
that was because of the constraints on 
the numbers of tests that were avail-
able. The fact is, if you are not suf-
fering from any symptoms, you are 
probably not highly motivated to go 
get a test because you may not even 
know you have the virus, and you may 
not know you need one. 
We are testing a lot more now than 
we were back then. Congress has pro-
vided another $26 billion to scale up 
testing, and we have gone from con-
ducting an average of 145,000 tests a 
day nationwide in early April to more 
than 780,000 per day in mid-July. So 
that has been a dramatic improvement. 
What we know is there is more we need 
to do. 
The HEALS Act, which we intro-
duced yesterday, will provide an addi-
tional $16 billion to support testing ef-
forts. When combined with the approxi-
mately $9 billion that still exists from 
the previous bills, it will make another 
$25 billion available to strengthen our 
testing nationwide. This will help to 
improve our testing strategy and ca-
pacity and reduce the backlog that has 
left some Texans waiting more than 2 
weeks for test results. These tests are 
not very useful if it takes 2 weeks to 
get the results. 
Because we ramped up the number of 
people who were tested, the lab compa-
nies that were analyzing the tests 
ended up getting backlogged. Now we 
have taken corrective measures in cit-
ies like Dallas to make other testing 
available and bring that number down, 
but this has been a constant challenge. 
It needs to be as quick and easy as pos-
sible for folks not only to get tests but 
to get the results, and this funding 
helps to make sure there will be seri-
ous strides in support of that goal. 
I know there are testing protocols 
that are being analyzed right now that 
may make this easier and may even 
make the results quicker. I know, for 
example, in the Texas A&M University 
System, Chancellor Sharp said he has 
contracted for 15,000 tests a month for 
students who will return on campus. 
Now, in his view, he said those students 
will probably be safer on campus than 
they will be back home, especially if 
they end up going to bars or other so-
cial venues and do not properly social 
distance or wear masks. 
Beyond testing, we need additional 
support for the healthcare providers 
who have been on the frontlines. In my 
State, I know the Governor has asked a 
number of hospitals in the hardest hit 
areas to defer elective surgeries. As I 
have come to learn and as the Pre-
siding Officer, no doubt, knows, that is 
how hospitals pay the bills. Many of 
the people who show up either get 
charity care or the payment through 
Medicaid or Medicare is less than that 
from private health insurance, so hos-
pitals need a mix of elective surgeries 
and other treatments so they will have 
full insurance coverage in order to bal-
ance their books overall. 
Congress has already provided $175 
billion for a healthcare provider relief 
fund, which has given hospitals, clin-
ics, and physicians the resources they 
need to continue treating COVID–19 pa-
tients and stay afloat financially. So 
far, more than 20,000 hospitals and 
healthcare providers in my State alone 
have benefited from that funding, with 
over $4.1 billion coming to Texas. 
The HEALS Act will supplement that 
fund with an additional $25 billion to 
help these providers navigate the surge 
in cases and maintain critical supplies 
like masks, gloves, and ventilators. If 
our hospitals don’t have the personal 
protective equipment to protect the 
frontline staff, the resources to treat 
patients, or the funding to keep their 
doors open, we will be in bad, bad 
shape. This legislation will go a long 
way to making sure we don’t ever 
reach that point. 
In addition to supplementing the 
healthcare provider relief fund, this 
legislation will also support some of 
our most critical health resources. We 
know our community health centers 
are an important part of the safety net 
when it comes to accessing healthcare. 
This bill will provide $7.6 billion to our 
community health centers, which usu-
ally serve people on a sliding scale 
based on their ability to pay. Some 
people have full insurance coverage; 
others are covered by Medicare or Med-
icaid; and some simply don’t have the 
means to pay at all, but all are wel-
come and are treated at our commu-
nity health centers. 
We also send $4.5 billion to mental 
health, suicide prevention, and sub-
stance use disorder services. We all 
know that the mitigation efforts we 
have all been engaged in by staying in 
our homes and not leaving for a period 
of time, as instructed by public health 
and other government officials, has ex-
acted a very difficult toll on families, 
particularly on people who have had 
nowhere to go to escape somebody who 
has been abusing them in domestic vio-
lence scenarios or on people who are 
simply feeling a sense of isolation and 
a challenge to their mental health as 
they wonder how they are going to pay 
the bills and take care of their fami-
lies. Maybe they have loved ones who 
are in nursing homes—the elderly are 
particularly 
vulnerable—whom 
they 
haven’t been able to see because of the 
isolation efforts. 
And then we know people will self- 
medicate with alcohol or drugs. So this

$4.5 billion is important to help provide 
the mental health, suicide prevention, 
and substance use disorder services 
that are going to be needed not only 
right now but in the indefinite future. 
We also provide an additional $15 bil-
lion to the National Institutes of 
Health for research and an additional 
$26 billion for vaccine research. 
We know our frontline healthcare 
providers have gotten much, much bet-
ter and saved many more lives by com-
ing up with treatments that actually 
have been effective. Some of these are 
common prescription drugs that are 
used for other purposes that have been 
repurposed for treatment of COVID–19 
symptoms. 
We know that convalescent plasma, 
taken from people who have had the 
virus, who have developed immunities, 
when they donate blood, that plasma 
can actually be used to help treat pa-
tients with serious COVID–19 symp-
toms. 
And we know that there are other 
treatments in progress, along with the 
race to get a vaccine. Ultimately, we 
know that the vaccine is going to be 
important to our ability to defeat and 
live with this virus. 
But in the meantime, we know we 
need to learn to live with this virus in 
a way that protects our public health 
and allows us to safely reopen our 
economy. 
So the last thing I want to mention 
is liability protection. Why is this so 
important? 
Well, as many nonprofits or busi-
nesses think about reopening, thinking 
about kids going back to school safe-
ly—whether 
online 
and 
then 
transitioning to in person, or colleges 
and universities—we know that there 
are going to be a lot of lawsuits filed, 
second guessing why people didn’t do 
something different, when, in fact, this 
pandemic has surprised all of us in so 
many ways. 
And what this does is provide a safe 
harbor from legal liability for those in-
dividuals who followed government 
guidance in good faith. It can’t be the 
fact that you would subject a frontline 
healthcare worker who had no choice 
but to put on personal protective 
equipment and go to work to treat pa-
tients—it would be a cruel joke to say: 
Now we are going to come back and file 
lawsuits against you and sue you for 
money damages because you didn’t 
somehow know exactly what you were 
dealing with. 
We know that frontline healthcare 
workers are performing a physically 
and mentally taxing job, made only 
more difficult by the fact we didn’t un-
derstand exactly what we were dealing 
with, with this novel virus, and we are 
still learning more. 
Well, I learned, for example, about a 
rural hospital where test kits are in 
short supply. In fact, it was especially 
true in the early days as testing infra-
structure was being stood up, and I 
mentioned that a moment ago. 
I learned about a hospital in a rural 
community outside Wichita Falls that 
only had 12 tests available. Because of 
limited resources, a physician made 
the difficult decision not to test an ER 
patient for COVID–19 because the pa-
tient didn’t meet the criteria set out 
by the Centers for Disease Control. The 
following day, that same patient went 
to Wichita Falls and received a test, 
and several days later found out that 
they tested positive. 
Now, imagine you are that physician. 
You followed the CDC guidelines for 
testing; you tried to conserve the lim-
ited resources available in your com-
munity; but there is nothing stopping 
the patient from heading to the nearest 
lawyer’s office and filing a lawsuit 
against you for somehow refusing them 
a test. 
All of a sudden, you are scrambling 
to defend yourself in a lawsuit that, 
quite frankly, should not have been 
filed in the first place. 
But I have spent enough time in 
courtrooms to know that many times 
lawsuits are not filed with the goal of 
actually prevailing on the merits; they 
are filed in order to gain a settlement 
because the cost of defending yourself 
can be large, indeed. And, in fact, if 
you are a business that has been hang-
ing on by a thread, just the threat of 
that kind of litigation and the expense 
and energy it takes to defend that case, 
even though it lacks merit, could well 
cause you to throw in the towel or put 
you out of business. 
So we have introduced, as part of this 
HEALS Act, legislation that will pro-
vide that safe harbor. It will not pro-
vide blanket immunity; it will not pro-
tect against intentional or reckless 
misconduct; but it would establish 
clear guardrails like those in a number 
of States. As a matter of fact, 30 dif-
ferent States have passed similar pro-
tections for their healthcare workers. 
Other States have done it in other cat-
egories, but it is important, I believe, 
for us to provide clear authority so 
people know what they are dealing 
with. 
I would note, for example, that some 
of these same guardrails are very simi-
lar to those enacted by Executive order 
in the minority leader’s home State of 
New York. I know the legislature has 
now sent Governor Cuomo another bill, 
basically, with the same framework, 
and he has not yet made a decision to 
sign that. 
But overall the HEALS Act will help 
provide the resources Texas hospitals, 
clinics, and healthcare providers need 
to sustain and win this fight, while 
protecting our heroic healthcare work-
ers from a second epidemic in the 
courtroom. 
So I hope both sides of the aisle will 
work together, as we have in the past 
on COVID–19 response legislation, and 
make sure we can get a bill to the 
President’s desk on a timely basis that 
delivers these and other necessary 
changes at a critical time for our coun-
try. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
Senator DURBIN and I have worked for 
months 
on 
an 
issue 
on 
rural 
healthcare. Whether it is in rural Illi-
nois or it is in rural Oklahoma, there is 
a challenge dealing with rural hos-
pitals and sustaining their viability. 
So Senator DURBIN and I partnered 
together to determine what is the best 
way to get a solution that is a long- 
term solution to what they are cur-
rently facing with COVID–19. 
While COVID–19 has impacted all 
types of businesses, rural hospitals 
have uniquely dealt with some very dif-
ficult challenges. Getting PPE early on 
in the process was much more chal-
lenging for rural hospitals than it was 
for urban—keeping doctors, managing 
separation, getting airflow areas in 
hospitals to manage the flow of the 
virus through areas, and also managing 
just patient count, where, for many 
rural hospitals, they just shut down be-
cause all elective surgery was stopped 
and such, and so they lost all of that 
income, though they still had all the 
employees. It was an exceptionally 
challenging thing, but it is challenging 
on top of the challenge that they have 
already faced for decades in just sur-
viving in rural America. 
So what Senator DURBIN and I have 
brought is a reasonable, nonpartisan 
solution to how we can deal with not 
only COVID–19 but to help rural hos-
pitals long term. 
Decades ago, Congress established 
something called the critical access 
hospital and made sure that those hos-
pitals that were designated ‘‘critical 
access hospitals’’ would receive proper 
reimbursement from the Federal Gov-
ernment for healthcare services. 
Many individuals in rural areas—in 
fact, the dominant proportion in many 
rural areas receiving healthcare are re-
ceiving it through Medicaid or Medi-
care. We want to make sure that those 
providers providing those high-need 
areas are reimbursed appropriately. 
But, in 2006, Congress shifted the des-
ignation for critical access hospitals 
and took away something called the 
necessary provider, giving the flexi-
bility to the States. 
As a result of that action in 2006, we 
have seen the closure of 118 rural hos-
pitals nationwide since that time pe-
riod. The ‘‘critical access hospital’’ 
designation was created because of a 
string of hospital closures in the 1980s 
and early 1990s. Yet we have not re-
sponded in the way that we should 
from the change in statute in 2006. 
Simply what we are trying to do is to 
give that flexibility back to States 
again. If they have a hospital in a rural 
area that is the only provider in that 
community that is a Medicare-depend-
ent hospital or is a very small hospital

with fewer than 50 beds, that area has 
to be an area that is designated as a 
rural area. It can’t just be any subur-
ban area or any other type of hospital. 
It has to be a rural hospital in par-
ticular. It has to have a high percent-
age relative to the national average of 
individuals with income below the pov-
erty line. Those hospitals in those loca-
tions could be designated by their 
States as a necessary provider and be 
treated as if they are a critical access 
hospital. What would that do? That 
would be a lifeline for reimbursement 
because now we have some rural hos-
pitals designated as critical access and 
some hospitals that meet all the other 
criteria, but they may be 34 miles away 
from another hospital, so that hospital 
in that county dies while the other 
hospital survives. In my State, we have 
a critical access hospital 34 miles away 
from a hospital across the border in 
Texas, so the hospital in Oklahoma 
can’t get the critical access designa-
tion and can’t survive because 34 miles 
away there is a hospital in another 
State that has the critical access. 
We need the flexibility in our States 
to be able to do this kind of designa-
tion. Senator DURBIN and I have run 
this through a lot of places and a lot of 
people, and we have gotten a lot of 
technical input in it to make sure this 
actually works for our rural hospitals 
and provides not just a short-term sur-
vival through COVID–19 but also pro-
vides long-term stability for them. 
This is the kind of work we should do 
together to make sure we stabilize 
those rural hospitals. They are a life-
line to people in rural America. They 
are a lifeline of employment, and they 
are a stable feature in every commu-
nity. Without them, those commu-
nities dry up because people need ac-
cess to healthcare, and this is the way 
that they can get it. 
I am glad to partner with Senator 
DURBIN on this issue, and it is our hope 
to get this into the next bill dealing 
with COVID–19 in the days ahead. Quite 
frankly, it was our hope to get it into 
the last one—we didn’t get it—and into 
the 
one 
before 
that. 
Surprisingly 
enough, everyone seems to be nodding 
their heads on both sides of the aisle 
saying: That is a good idea. That will 
be effective. We want to move it from 
‘‘that is a good idea’’ to ‘‘done’’ for the 
sake of rural hospitals across the Na-
tion. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague 
from Oklahoma. I could not have said 
it any better or more effectively than 
he just did. 
Like Oklahoma, downstate Illinois 
has an area of smaller cities and rural 
towns and smalltown communities. 
Many of them are lucky enough to 
have great hospitals, and they love 
their hospitals. They are not only im-
portant sources of medical care; they 
are a major part of the local economy 
and really are a rallying point for com-
munities. Auxiliaries, volunteers, and 
so many people make these hospitals 
the focal point when you visit these 
communities. They are so proud of 
them. 
Of course, we are worried about what 
this current pandemic is going to do. I 
have had conference calls with leaders 
from almost 120 hospitals across Illi-
nois. I invited Members of Congress in, 
so we had bipartisan exchanges about 
the current state of affairs. One hos-
pital 
CEO 
from 
Crawford 
County, 
downstate along the Indiana border, 
told me that he used to pay 22 cents for 
a surgical gown, and now he pays be-
tween $11 and $20 for each one. Hos-
pitals are facing limited access to re-
agents, swabs, and supplies that they 
need. The Heroes Act would direct the 
administration to utilize the Defense 
Production Act to help solve that prob-
lem, and I commend Senators MURPHY 
and BALDWIN
for their legislation, 
which I am joining, to do the same. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
profound 
con-
sequences of the pandemic is the im-
pact on the solvency of these hospitals. 
Across Illinois, rural hospitals are the 
heart and soul of the community; oth-
erwise, people drive literally for hours 
to get medical care, sometimes in 
emergency situations. They are impor-
tant parts of the local economy. We 
think downstate hospitals generate $5 
billion into our State economy each 
year, and I don’t doubt that. 
This pandemic has pushed them to 
the brink. Even prior to this crisis, 
they were facing financial uncertainty. 
Half of rural hospitals were operating 
in the red. One in four were at risk of 
closure. As the Senator from Oklahoma 
mentioned, 120 have closed across the 
Nation in the past decade. 
We have fared a little better in Illi-
nois, but we are worried about the fu-
ture. When a rural hospital closes, not 
only do doctors disappear, but jobs dis-
appear, and businesses struggle to stay. 
The coronavirus pandemic has accel-
erated and compounded the strains we 
face. We believe our Illinois hospitals 
are losing $1.4 billion each month. 
Many, like those near nursing homes 
and meat processing plants, have had 
to expand surge staffing to deal with 
COVID patients. All have been forced 
to cancel outpatient and elective serv-
ices. In Illinois, 70 percent of rural hos-
pital revenues are from outpatient 
services. The same is true in neigh-
boring States like Kentucky. 
Nationwide, rural hospitals have on 
average only 33 days of cash on hand. 
There is an immediate need to sta-
bilize, and that is why we have come up 
with this bipartisan plan. Senator 
JAMES LANKFORD and I have introduced 
a bill called the Rural Hospital Closure 
Relief Act. It is supported by the 
American Hospital Association and the 
National Rural Health Association. It 
would update Medicare’s ‘‘critical ac-
cess hospital’’ designation to provide 
flexibility around the 35-mile distance 
requirement, so more rural hospitals 
would qualify for additional payments 
from the Federal Government. 
We project that six hospitals in Iowa 
and scores more in Illinois, New York, 
and Kentucky would qualify for this fi-
nancial lifeline, securing their sta-
bility. We do it in a restrained, cost-ef-
fective manner by focusing on the hos-
pitals that have faced financial losses 
and are located in areas with a short-
age of healthcare providers. It is com-
mon sense. 
This bipartisan bill is a priority for 
us. We want to make it a priority for 
the Senate, and we hope to do so. We 
know that we have come to this discus-
sion with a good, encouraging con-
versation 
with 
Senator 
GRASSLEY 
today in support of the Iowa Rural 
Health Association. The CEO and lead-
er of the Kentucky Rural Health Asso-
ciation projects that more than 18 
rural hospitals in that State are at 
high risk of closure. We hope to make 
that point very clear to the majority 
leader. Several of them would be 
helped by our legislation. 
With a spike in COVID–19 cases 
across rural America, we have seen 
hospitals reaching capacity, and we 
need to make sure that our hospitals— 
the ones we are talking about in rural 
areas—survive. The health and eco-
nomic toll of this crises demands it. I 
hope that Democrats and Republicans 
in the Senate include this in any bipar-
tisan package. The cost of inaction will 
be disastrous. 
Senator LANKFORD and I were pre-
pared to seek passage of this bill by 
unanimous consent today, but we have 
been encouraged to continue negoti-
ating with our colleagues to see if we 
can make it part of the package—a 
timely part of the package—in the near 
future. I hope that is the case, and we 
will hold off from any unanimous con-
sent request because of that hope. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 6 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
month, in a landmark decision, the Su-
preme 
Court 
rejected 
President 
Trump’s effort to repeal deportation 
protections for Dreamers. Those are 
the young immigrants who came to the 
United States as children. 
In an opinion by Chief Justice John 
Roberts, the Court held that President 
Trump’s attempt to rescind DACA, De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, 
was ‘‘arbitrary and capricious.’’ 
Those were the words of the Court. 
More than a month later, the Trump 
administration has refused to restore 
the DACA Program despite the deci-
sion written by the Chief Justice. The 
administration is now in open defiance 
of the Supreme Court when it comes to 
the DACA Program. The stakes are too 
high, both for the rule of law and the 
lives of these young Dreamers, for us 
to ignore it. Republicans and Demo-
crats in Congress need to come to-
gether to compel the President to im-
mediately comply with the Supreme 
Court mandate. 
On June 4, 2019, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed H.R. 6. In 2019, they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4537 
July 28, 2020 
passed H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise 
Act. 
This 
legislation 
would 
give 
Dreamers a path to citizenship, and it 
passed on a strong bipartisan vote. The 
Dream and Promise Act has been pend-
ing in the Senate on the desk of Sen-
ator MCCONNELL for more than a year. 
Last month, I sent a letter signed by 
all 47 Democratic Senators, calling on 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL to imme-
diately schedule a vote on the Dream 
and Promise Act. As of today, Senator 
MCCONNELL has not even replied to this 
letter. Since Senator MCCONNELL re-
fuses to take any action to address the 
plight of these Dreamers, I will ask 
unanimous consent at this point for 
the Senate to pass the bipartisan 
Dream and Promise Act. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 112, H.R. 6, the American Dream 
and Promise Act; further, that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, Senator 
DURBIN
knows extremely well that 
unanimous consent is trying to get all 
100 Senators to agree on something. 
Senator DURBIN has done remarkable 
work for years advocating on the issue 
of immigration, and he knows excep-
tionally well what a difficult issue this 
is. He has been involved in countless 
debates and negotiations dealing with 
this issue, and there is certainly not 
100 percent agreement on a House bill 
that passed in 2019 on how to solve im-
migration. 
So it is not going to pass. I certainly 
will object in a moment to this. 
This bill far exceeds just dealing with 
DACA. As this body knows very well, 
there were four separate votes dealing 
with immigration in February of 2018. 
At that time, three of those dealt with 
the issue of DACA, and none of those 
actually were able to get 60 votes to be 
able to pass. 
The Trump administration was very 
engaged in those negotiations, and the 
White House itself brought a proposal 
to deal with DACA and multiple other 
issues with immigration. It failed to 
get 60 votes to move it in 2018, and the 
Court at that time swooped it up and 
said they wanted to be able to look at 
it. 
Now 2 years later, the Court finally 
responded, putting it back into the ad-
ministration’s hands and, quite frank-
ly, back into Congress’s hands. 
I will tell you, I wish the Court had 
not engaged in 2018 because there was a 
lot of engagement from the Trump ad-
ministration, from the Senate, and 
from the House to be able to come to a 
point of resolution, but that has to 
begin again with bipartisan negotia-
tions through a very complicated issue. 
President Trump has stated numer-
ous times in public interviews and in 
private conversations that he wants to 
do something to take care of those kids 
in DACA, but that is not what this par-
ticular bill does. This particular bill 
far exceeds just the DACA population. 
In fact, the DACA population is defined 
as the group that was 16 years old and 
in the United States before June 15, 
2017. This bill deals with 18-year-olds in 
the United States just 4 years ago and 
before, greatly increasing the popu-
lation in the conversation. So this is 
not just a DACA conversation; this is a 
much larger bill than just a DACA bill 
in that sense. 
While I do agree we do need to con-
tinue 
bipartisan 
conversations—and 
President Trump has expressed a desire 
to engage in that—I think this is some-
thing the White House, the House, and 
the Senate should work out and not try 
to have all 100 Senators agree on some-
thing that comes to the floor today 
that has not gone through the proper 
debate and does not have all three bod-
ies engaged in the process. 
With that, I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I re-
gret the fact that the Senator objected. 
I am not surprised, but I understand 
his statement. I do hope that he feels 
as I do that we should be working in a 
bipartisan fashion to find an answer to 
this challenge. 
I have been working on this Dream 
Act for a number of years. Over 780,000 
young people have signed up for DACA, 
and many more are currently eligible, 
and I would like to address their plight 
in just a moment here on the floor. But 
I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for 
the encouraging words to continue this 
effort. It is long past time for us to find 
a bipartisan answer to this situation. 
It was, in fact, 10 years ago when I 
joined with Senator Richard Lugar, a 
Republican from Indiana, on a bipar-
tisan basis to call on President Obama 
to use his legal authority to protect 
Dreamers from deportation. President 
Obama 
responded 
by 
creating 
the 
DACA Program. DACA provides tem-
porary protection from deportation of 
Dreamers if they register with the gov-
ernment, pay a fee, and pass criminal 
and 
national 
security 
background 
checks. 
I got started on this 20 years ago. I 
know you have to be patient to serve in 
the U.S. Senate, but I am losing my pa-
tience, not for my own plight and situ-
ation but for these young people. We 
know their circumstances. They were 
brought to this country as infants, tod-
dlers, and little kids. They grew up 
here thinking this was home. It was 
home. They went to our schools. They 
pledged allegiance to our flag. They 
counted themselves as just another 
American kid. Then, sometime when 
they were teenagers, mom and dad sat 
down with them and said: We have a se-
rious matter to discuss with you. It 
turns out you are undocumented. Tech-
nically, you are illegal in your pres-
ence in the United States, and let us 
warn you that at any moment you 
could be stopped, arrested, and de-
ported. In fact, they might even drag 
many members of the family along 
with you if that circumstance should 
apply. 
Imagine growing up with that as a 
teenager, with all the things you worry 
about in adolescence, worrying about a 
knock on the door and deportation 
that might drag along other members 
of your family. That is how these kids 
lived. That is how they grew up. 
One of them came to my attention in 
Chicago. Her name is Tereza Lee. 
Tereza came to the United States origi-
nally from Korea through Brazil. She 
came to Chicago with her family on a 
visitor visa at the age of 2. Her family 
stayed. Most of them reached legal sta-
tus, but they never filed any papers for 
Tereza. She didn’t discover until she 
was in high school that she was an un-
documented person in America. 
She just happened to have an ex-
traordinary talent as a musician. She 
signed up for a program known as the 
MERIT Music Program. They taught 
her how to play the piano, which she 
had already started learning. She was 
found so phenomenal that by the end of 
her high school years, her instructor 
said: Why don’t you apply to the great 
music schools of America—Juilliard or 
the Manhattan conservatory of music? 
She started to fill out the application 
with her mom and came to the section 
where it said ‘‘citizenship,’’ and she 
said: What are we supposed to put 
there, Mom? 
And her mom said: I don’t know. We 
better call the office of Senator DUR-
BIN. 
They called us, and we learned for 
the first time of Tereza’s situation. 
Under the law of America, despite the 
fact that this 2-year-old girl who ar-
rived in the United States and now is 
18 years of age—under the laws of the 
United States, she was compelled to 
leave the United States for 10 years 
and apply to come back in. 
How could you do that? She didn’t 
choose to come to this country. She 
didn’t choose not to file for the right 
legal papers. She was the victim of this 
situation. So, on her behalf, I intro-
duced the DREAM Act, and over the 
years, I have tried my level best in 
every way imaginable to pass it and 
make it the law of the land so that 
young people just like her can have a 
chance to earn their way to permanent 
status in the United States and ulti-
mately to citizenship. 
I often fail to tell the end of this 
story, and I want to tell it because 
many people say: What ever happened 
to Tereza Lee? Well, the fact is, she 
was accepted by the Manhattan con-
servatory of music, and these wonder-
ful people in Chicago—including my 
dear friend Joan Harris—said: We will 
pay for her education. She is so good. 
They did it. She finished. She mar-
ried an American Jazz musician and

became an American citizen by virtue 
of that decision. They now have three 
children. She just emailed me last 
week. She just got her Ph.D. in music. 
She has performed in Carnegie Hall. 
She is an amazing young woman. She 
was the first Dreamer. 
That is not a unique story. I have 
come to the floor over 100 times and 
told stories just like that of young peo-
ple brought to the United States who 
are remarkable and who could really 
add so much to this country. 
There have been some 800,000 Dream-
ers who have come forward to sign up 
for DACA, the program we discussed 
earlier. DACA, under President Obama, 
by Executive order, unleashed the full 
potential of many of these Dreamers 
for the first time. They could be public 
about their status, go to college, and 
do things they dreamed of. Many of 
them today are contributing to this 
country as soldiers and teachers and 
owners 
of 
small 
businesses 
and 
healthcare workers. 
More than 200,000 DACA recipients 
are essential, critical, infrastructure 
workers. That is not my term; that is 
a term of the Donald Trump Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. That is 
how they are classified: essential, crit-
ical infrastructure workers; 200,000—a 
fourth of the DACA recipients. Among 
them are 41,700 DACA recipients in the 
healthcare industry—doctors, intensive 
care nurses, paramedics, respiratory 
therapists, and health professionals 
like the one I will talk about in just a 
moment. 
But on September 5, 2017, despite his 
assurances to me and so many others 
that he would take special care of 
these young people, these Dreamers, 
President Trump repealed DACA. Hun-
dreds of thousands of Dreamers faced 
losing their work permits and being de-
ported out of the United States to 
countries they didn’t even remember. 
Federal courts stepped in and ordered 
the Trump administration to continue 
the DACA Program while they resolved 
in court whether the President’s ac-
tions were proper. However, Dreamers 
who have not received DACA protec-
tion have been blocked from applying 
for this protection now for almost 3 
years. For example, children cannot 
apply for DACA until they reach the 
age of 15. The Center for American 
Progress estimates that approximately 
300,000 Dreamers have been unable to 
apply for this program since President 
Trump abolished it—or tried to—on 
September 5, 2017. Fifty-five thousand 
of those young people have turned 15 in 
that period of time. 
Since the Supreme Court decision 
more than a month ago, the Trump ad-
ministration—the Trump administra-
tion—has failed to comply with Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court John 
Roberts’ order rejecting the repeal of 
DACA and requiring the Trump admin-
istration to reopen the program. The 
Trump administration is knowingly 
avoiding and violating the order of this 
Court. 
Two weeks ago, I joined with Senator 
KAMALA
HARRIS
in leading a letter 
from 33 Senators to the Acting Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, Chad 
Wolf. Our letter called on the Trump 
administration to immediately comply 
with the Supreme Court decision and 
reopen DACA for those who want to 
seek admission or at least protection 
under that program. So far, of course, 
we have not received a response to our 
letter, but that is not unusual with 
this administration. 
Ten days ago, a Federal judge issued 
an order for the Trump administration 
to follow the law and follow the order 
of the Supreme Court and begin accept-
ing new applications for DACA. So ear-
lier today, Acting Secretary Chad Wolf 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity finally responded. Here is what he 
said: ‘‘The Department of Homeland 
Security will take action to thought-
fully consider the future of DACA pol-
icy, including whether to fully rescind 
the program.’’ He said: ‘‘In the interim, 
DHS will reject all initial requests for 
DACA.’’ That is in open defiance of the 
order of the Supreme Court in the deci-
sion issued by Chief Justice John Rob-
erts—open defiance by the President 
and his administration. What on Earth 
is this supposed to mean? 
If the Trump administration wants 
to repeal DACA again—and I pray that 
they won’t—they can certainly try, and 
they can see if that action would be ar-
bitrary, capricious, or would somehow 
withstand legal scrutiny. But under 
our system of separation of powers, the 
executive branch of government does 
not get to ‘‘thoughtfully consider’’ 
whether to comply with a Supreme 
Court order for some undefined period 
of time. 
Let’s be clear. The Supreme Court re-
jected the repeal of DACA. That means 
DACA returns to its original status, 
and the Trump administration must re-
open the program, and they must do it 
now. Instead, Mr. Wolf is saying the 
DHS is going to turn away 300,000 
Dreamers eligible for DACA who have 
not had a chance to apply because the 
case has been in court. 
Mr. Wolf claims the administration 
is following the law, but it is notable 
that the Department of Homeland Se-
curity website still features a state-
ment from a DHS official saying the 
Supreme Court’s decision ‘‘has no basis 
in law.’’ 
After the Supreme Court decision, 
President Trump tweeted: ‘‘I have 
wanted to take care of DACA recipi-
ents better than the Do Nothing Demo-
crats, but for 2 years they have refused 
to negotiate.’’ Well, here is the reality, 
and it isn’t the President’s tweet. The 
President has rejected numerous bipar-
tisan deals to protect the Dreamers. 
Take one example—February 15, 2018. 
The Senate considered bipartisan legis-
lation by Republican Senator MIKE 
ROUNDS
and 
Independent 
Senator 
ANGUS KING. The bill, which included a 
path to citizenship for Dreamers, was 
supported by a bipartisan majority of 
Senators. It failed to reach 60 votes 
that it needed to pass the Senate be-
cause President Trump opposed it. Re-
member when he said that the Demo-
crats were at fault here, that there 
were no bipartisan measures to solve 
the problem? Here was a bipartisan 
measure that he openly opposed. On 
the same day, the Senate voted on the 
President’s immigration proposal. The 
Trump plan failed by a bipartisan ma-
jority of 39 to 60. 
Over the years, I have come to the 
floor of the Senate many times to tell 
the stories of Dreamers. These stories 
tell the whole story, as far as I am con-
cerned, as to what is at stake with the 
future of DACA and the Dream Act. 
Let me tell you the story today 
about this young man, Juan Alvarez— 
125th Dreamer—whom I have come to 
the floor to introduce to the Senate 
and the people who are watching. 
He came to the United States from 
Mexico at 3 years of age and grew up in 
Compton, CA. A great student. From a 
young age, he wanted to get involved 
in healthcare, but because of his immi-
gration status—undocumented—he was 
unable to attend medical or nursing 
school. Instead, he went to the Cali-
fornia State University in Long Beach, 
where he completed a bachelor of 
science degree in nutrition and dietet-
ics. Today, thanks to DACA, Juan is 
working as a dietitian at an acute care 
hospital in Los Angeles. 
He sent me a letter, and here is what 
he said: 
I never imagined that I would be able to 
work in the field that I love and am pas-
sionate about—but thanks to DACA, that 
was made possible. Simply said, DACA has 
opened doors for me that I once thought 
were bolted shut and completely out of 
reach. 
Now, Juan Alvarez is on the frontline 
of the coronavirus pandemic. He is part 
of this hospital’s critical care team 
treating patients with coronavirus. 
Juan’s role is to ensure that patients 
receive adequate nutrition during their 
hospital stay so they survive. Here is 
what he said about this experience: 
I am in constant fear of being infected and 
then infecting my family. But as an essential 
healthcare worker, I continue to show up to 
work and put myself at risk so that I can 
continue to serve my patients. While I do it 
to continue to help my patients and make 
sure that they are well nourished and strong 
enough to fight off the virus, I cannot set 
aside how worried I am myself. 
I want to thank Juan Alvarez for his 
service. He is an immigrant health 
hero. He is a DACA health hero. He is 
putting himself and his family at risk 
to save the lives of other Americans. 
He shouldn’t have to worry about 
whether he is going to be deported. 
Will America be a stronger country if 
we tell him to leave or if we send him 
back to Mexico, which he doesn’t even 
remember, or if we allow him to be-
come a citizen and to use his skills and 
education and training to continue to 
help others? I think the answer is 
clear. 
Juan and hundreds of thousands of 
other Dreamers are counting on those

of us who serve in the Senate to solve 
this crisis that President Trump has 
created. 
I am sorry there was an objection to 
the Dream and Promise Act today. So 
long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will con-
tinue to come to this floor day after 
day, week after week, and month after 
month until the Senate gives Juan Al-
varez a chance to become part of Amer-
ica’s future. It would be an American 
tragedy to deport this wonderful and 
talented young healthcare worker who 
is literally saving lives as we meet 
today in the Senate. 
We must ensure that Juan and hun-
dreds of thousands of others in our es-
sential workforce are not forced to stop 
when the need for their service has 
never been greater. We must give them 
the chance they deserve to become part 
of the American family.

REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
today I rise to honor a leader, a fight-
er, and a hero: Congressman John 
Lewis. 
A few years ago, I was fortunate 
enough to travel to Selma, AL, with 
Congressman Lewis to commemorate 
‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ when the then 25- 
year-old activist helped to lead 600 peo-
ple across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
At the end of the bridge, the march-
ers were attacked with billy clubs and 
tear gas. Congressman Lewis’s skull 
was fractured. He bore the scars until 
the day he died. 
And that weekend, 48 years later, the 
White police chief of Montgomery 
handed his police badge to Congress-
man Lewis and publicly apologized for 
the police not protecting him and the 
Freedom Marchers. 
Forty-eight years is a long time for 
an apology, and it only happened be-
cause Congressman Lewis never quit 
fighting for progress, for civil rights, 
for economic justice, and for voting 
rights for every single American. 
It was because of that spirit of per-
sistence and resilience that I will al-
ways be in awe of Congressman John 
Lewis. 
He never lost his faith that this 
country could be better, if only we put 
in the work. He never gave up on jus-
tice. He never stopped marching to-
ward freedom. 
John Lewis was born to share-
croppers in the Jim Crow South and 
dedicated his life to the civil rights 
movement. 
As one of the original 13 Freedom 
Riders, he took on segregation. Despite 
being met by angry mobs, beatings, 
and arrests, Congressman Lewis didn’t 
give up. 
Wise beyond his years, he was the 
youngest speaker at the 1963 March on 
Washington, which he also helped to 
organize. His words from that day have 
become a rallying cry for all those 
seeking 
equality. 
As 
Congressman 
Lewis explained, ‘‘To those who have 
said, ‘Be patient and wait,’ we must 
say that we cannot be patient. We do 
not want our freedom gradually but we 
want to be free now.’’ 
In 1964, he coordinated efforts for the 
‘‘Mississippi Freedom Summer,’’ re-
cruiting college students from around 
the country, including Minnesota, to 
join the movement to register Black 
voters across the South. 
And still, he was far from done. In 
1986, Congressman Lewis became the 
second African-American to be elected 
to Congress from Georgia since Recon-
struction, propelled by the same Black 
voters he had helped to empower and 
mobilize. 
Once in Congress, John Lewis never 
stopped fighting, for voting rights, for 
basic human rights like healthcare, 
and for a more just and equal America. 
There are so many reasons that we 
will miss him dearly, his unwavering 
persistence being just one. But now, it 
is up to us. To honor his life and carry 
on his legacy, we must not quit. So 
let’s pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, and let’s all 
try and get in some good trouble.

Mitchell, the director of the Commu-
nity Initiatives Team at Luke Air 
Force Base in Arizona. Mr. Mitchell 
will be retiring this month after over 
39 years of government service to our 
country. 
Upon 
completion 
of 
his 
under-
graduate degree at the University of 
Southern California as an ROTC cadet, 
Mr. Mitchell was commissioned in 1976 
to attend pilot training at the old Wil-
liams Air Force Base, which has a near 
and dear place to my heart, as I also 
attended it. 
The culmination of an impressive 22- 
year USAF career as the commander of 
the 21st Squadron, 56th Fighter Wing 
at Luke, he retired in 1998 as a lieuten-
ant colonel with multiple honors, in-
cluding the Defense Meritorious Serv-
ice Medal; the USAF Meritorious Serv-
ice Medal, with three oakleaf clusters; 
and 
the 
Air 
Force 
Commendation 
Medal. 
After 3 years as a pilot with United 
Airlines, Mr. Mitchell returned to Luke 
to take the lead as the director of the 
newly created Community Initiatives 
Team, CIT. Working with all 14 juris-
dictions around the air base, as well as 
the State of Arizona, Mr. Mitchell and 
his team took into account the inter-
ests of various stakeholders in the 
State, the Federal Government, and 
the local community. The results were 
beyond favorable. His team’s efforts 
transformed the entire community. 
CIT’s first-class work on the Stra-
tegic Basing process led to the USAF 
selecting Luke to serve as the F–35A 
training site, which brought 144 F–35s 
and significant investments to the 
base. Through initiatives such as the 
FAA’s approval of a Special Air Traffic 
Rule, which enhanced safety and re-
duced flying hour costs, Mr. Mitchell 
and his team have truly shown how es-
sential their role has been. There is no 
question that this work strengthened 
the Maricopa Area’s ties to Luke AFB. 
Under Mr. Mitchell’s leadership, CIT 
is now one of the country’s best exam-
ples of how to bring community lead-
ers, military families, and base leader-
ship together. The outcome has all 
three of these groups rallying around 
one shared mission: to support the 
base’s military personnel and readi-
ness. As a Valley resident for more 
than 25 years himself, Mr. Mitchell’s 
firsthand understanding has allowed 
him to personally address key issues at 
the base and in his community. His fre-
quent appearances at city council 
meetings and active involvement in 
the broader community truly highlight 
his unwavering dedication to building 
bridges between Luke AFB and the 
public. 
I would like to thank Lt. Col. (ret.) 
James ‘‘Rusty’’ Mitchell for his many 
years of service to our Nation, Luke 
AFB, and the Arizonans who call his 
community home. I have personally 
witnessed 
the 
many 
tremendous 
changes Rusty has made for Luke Air 
Force Base and the surrounding com-
munity. We will all be better off be-
cause of his selfless and tireless efforts. 
He will be sorely missed, and I wish 
him all the best in his retirement.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. SINEMA): 
S. 4342. A bill to establish a National 
Child Abuse Hotline; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleague from Ari-
zona, Senator SINEMA, in introducing 
legislation to support the operation of 
a national child abuse hotline. Of all 
the major national help hotlines, the 
crisis line for child abuse and neglect, 
which is currently operated by a na-
tional nonprofit, is the only one with-
out a federal authorization and dedi-
cated federal funding. Our bill, the Na-
tional Child Abuse Help Hotline Act of 
2020, would give the Administration for 
Children and Families the authority to 
award a grant to a national nonprofit 
to support a hotline dedicated to the 
prevention and intervention of child 
abuse and neglect. The child abuse and 
neglect crisis happening across the 
United States has only been exacer-
bated by the Covid–19 pandemic. 
On average, five children die every 
day from child abuse and neglect. Ac-
cording to the Department of Health 
and Human Services’ Child Maltreat-
ment Report, which was published in 
January 2020 and reflects 2018 figures, 
678,000 children were victims of mal-
treatment in 2018 and a heartbreaking 
1,770 children died—including three in 
Maine. These statistics reflect an un-
fortunate increase in both child fatali-
ties and victims of maltreatment, and 
is the first increase for the number of 
victims who suffered maltreatment 
since 2015. 
Access to prevention and interven-
tion services nationwide has only be-
come more critical in the face of the 
ongoing Covid–19 pandemic. The cur-
rent crisis threatens to severely exac-
erbate child abuse and neglect, and a 
number of experts predict that child 
abuse is currently being underreported. 
In Maine, when schools closed their 
doors on March 16 and stay-at-home or-
ders went in place, calls to Maine Child 
and Family Services decreased imme-
diately, falling 32 percent in the first 
month. Of note, only seven percent of 
calls were from school personnel, which 
is a dramatic drop from the 22 percent 
of teachers and other school staff— 
more than any other group—who call 
in typically to report abuse and ne-
glect. 
With stay-at-home orders, school clo-
sures, and high unemployment, fami-
lies are experiencing financial stress, 
isolation, and new anxieties at the very 
time when children have less exposure 
to mandatory reporters—such as teach-
ers, physicians, and coaches—and safe 
environments where one may normally 
escape or seek help. In April, Dr. Larry 
Ricci, a child abuse pediatrician at 
Spurwink, located in Portland, Maine, 
said ‘‘our sense is that not only is 
abuse still happening at the same rate 
it was happening before, in all likeli-
hood it has increased.’’ Dr. Ricci point-
ed out that ‘‘We’ve known for many 
years that the abuse rate mirrors the 
unemployment rate.’’ And as Michelle 
Fingerman, 
Vice 
President 
for 
Childhelp, a national nonprofit and the 
current operator of the Childhelp Na-
tional Child Abuse Hotline located in 
Arizona, details: ‘‘There is a wide range 
of fallout from pandemic anxiety and 
school shutdowns. There is more abuse 
already occurring in homes where care-
givers are melting down from the 
stress, children are trapped at home 
with abusers, schools and daycare are 
closed, and therapists and other front-
line providers are now more difficult to 
access.’’ 
During a time when children are not 
going to school, day care, or family re-
source centers, and, therefore, tradi-
tional resources may not be as easily 
accessible, 
the 
Childhelp 
National 
Child Abuse Hotline is a resource that 
is accessible to children and families 
across the country. The hotline, 1–800– 
4–A–CHILD, saw call volume increase 
by 33 percent from February to May. 
Childhelp’s text and online chat plat-
form, which is supported by a $1 mil-
lion ACF Innovation Grant that I have 
advocated for as a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, experienced a 
66 percent increase in outreach since 
February. 
The helpline importantly serves a 
wide range of individuals in every sin-
gle state—at-risk children, distressed 
parents seeking crisis intervention, 
and concerned individuals who suspect 
that child abuse may be occurring. In 
Maine, where one in every 71 children 
is a victim of abuse, the National Child 
Abuse Hotline assisted nearly 200 call-
ers in fiscal year 2019. Those in need 
are connected—either on the phone or 
by text or online chat—with masters- 
level social workers who are there to 
offer confidential crisis intervention 
and information, literature, and refer-
rals to emergency, social service, and 
support resources. 
The bill we are introducing today 
would provide a small but meaningful 
federal investment to protect children 
across the country—authorizing $1 mil-
lion annually for the Administration 
for Children and Families (ACF) to 
award a grant to a nonprofit entity to 
support a 24-hour, national, toll-free 
telephone hotline that will provide in-
formation and assistance to victims of

child abuse or neglect, parents, care-
givers, mandated reporters, and other 
concerned community members. This 
does not interfere with any state-man-
dated reporter hotlines and can be a re-
source for these individuals. In fact, 
the current operator has more than 80 
community partners in just Maine 
alone. 
The helpline’s dedication to the pre-
vention and intervention of child abuse 
and neglect is both successful and well- 
documented, and more federal support 
for this resource will improve our abil-
ity to reach children of all ages, as well 
as parents or caregivers in need. Dur-
ing a time when these supports are 
needed more there an ever, I believe 
the existing infrastructure and experi-
ence of the National Child Abuse Hot-
line should be used. Even with just 
more outreach and communications, 
we could better support the needs of 
children and families during the ongo-
ing Covid–19 pandemic and economic 
recovery. Action and investment now 
can help prevent the worst possible 
outcome—letting children fall through 
the cracks during an already trauma-
tizing crisis. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues 
to put the welfare of our nation’s chil-
dren at the forefront of our national 
Covid–19 response and to support the 
adoption of this important legislation, 
which will benefit children and fami-
lies in the age of Covid–19, as well as 
after this pandemic passes. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. LEE, and

SENATE RESOLUTION 659—DESIG-
NATING 
SEPTEMBER 
2020 
AS 
‘‘SCHOOL BUS SAFETY MONTH’’ 
Mrs. FISCHER (for herself and Ms. 
DUCKWORTH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 659 
Whereas, in an average year, on every 
school day in the United States, approxi-
mately 500,000 public and private school 
buses carry more than 26,000,000 K–12 stu-
dents to and from school; 
Whereas school buses comprise the largest 
mass transportation fleet in the United 
States; 
Whereas, in an average year, 48 percent of 
all K–12 students ride a school bus for each of 
the 180 school days in a year, and school bus 
operators drive school buses a total of nearly 
4,680,000,000 miles; 
Whereas the Child Safety Network (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘CSN’’), 
which is celebrating 31 years of public serv-
ice in the United States, supports the CSN 
Safe Bus campaign, which is designed to pro-
vide the school bus industry with driver 
training, the latest technology, and free 
safety and security resources; 
Whereas the designation of School Bus 
Safety Month will allow broadcast and dig-
ital media and social networking industries 
to commit to disseminating public service 
announcements that are produced to— 
(1) provide free resources designed to safe-
guard children; 
(2) recognize school bus operators and pro-
fessionals; and 
(3) encourage the driving public to engage 
in safer driving behavior near school buses 
when students board and disembark from 
school buses; 
Whereas key leaders who deserve recogni-
tion during School Bus Safety Month and be-
yond have— 
(1) provided security awareness training 
materials to more than 14,000 public and pri-
vate school districts; 
(2) trained more than 116,800 school bus op-
erators; and 
(3) provided more than 163,120 counterter-
rorism guides to individuals who are key to 
providing both safety and security for chil-
dren in the United States; and 
Whereas School Bus Safety Month offers 
the Senate and the people of the United 
States an opportunity to recognize and 
thank the school bus operators and the pro-
fessionals focused on school bus safety and 
security in the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates Sep-
tember 2020 as ‘‘School Bus Safety Month’’.

made his first passions preaching and min-
istry; 
Whereas John Lewis fought his first battle 
against segregation when he was just a teen-
ager, authoring a petition for equal access to 
his local public library, where African Amer-
icans had paid for the construction of the fa-
cilities but were banned from checking out 
books; 
Whereas, before his 21st birthday, John 
Lewis established his commitment to ‘‘good 
trouble’’ by organizing sit-ins at segregated 
restaurants and theaters; 
Whereas John Lewis helped found the Stu-
dent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, 
which advocated for civil disobedience and 
nonviolent resistance against segregation 
across the United States, bringing him to 
the forefront of the struggle of the United 
States for civil rights; 
Whereas John Lewis participated in the 
1961 Freedom Rides, which were a series of 
trips that tested a new desegregation order 
of interstate transportation facilities and re-
sulted 
in 
multiple 
beatings 
and 
the 
firebombing of the bus that John Lewis was 
supposed to be riding; 
Whereas, at 23 years of age, John Lewis 
served as the youngest member of the ‘‘Big 
Six’’, which planned the 1963 March on Wash-
ington, and worked alongside Martin Luther 
King, Jr., James Farmer, A. Philip Ran-
dolph, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young to 
advocate for racial equality and justice for 
all; 
Whereas John Lewis courageously led 
protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
in Selma, Alabama, bravely bearing violence 
from the police to embody the struggle of 
the United States to live up to its founding 
ideals of equal justice under the law; 
Whereas the bravery of John Lewis during 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ led Congress to pass, and 
President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign into

10301 et seq.), ensuring that African Ameri-
cans have the right to fully participate in 
the democratic process in the United States;

PER, Mr. MANCHIN, and Mrs. GILLI-
BRAND) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 661 
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et 
seq.), Congress recognized that ‘‘historically, 
society has tended to isolate and segregate 
individuals with disabilities, and, despite 
some improvements, such forms of discrimi-
nation against individuals with disabilities 
continue to be a serious and pervasive social 
problem’’; 
Whereas the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 recognized the rights of individ-
uals with disabilities to fully participate in 
their communities through independent liv-
ing, equality of opportunity, and economic 
self-sufficiency; 
Whereas, 30 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
and 21 years after the decision of the Su-
preme 
Court 
of 
the 
United 
States 
in 
Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), many in-
dividuals with disabilities continue to live in 
segregated institutional settings because of 
a lack of support services; 
Whereas continued instances of segregated 
institutional settings have hindered the in-
clusion of individuals with disabilities in 
communities, schools, and workplaces, un-
dermining the promise of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
Whereas people of color with disabilities 
experience disproportionately greater bar-
riers to service and access; 
Whereas, 30 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 
some telecommunication, electronic, and in-
formation technologies continue to be devel-
oped without the goal of full accessibility 
and inclusion for all people of the United 
States; and 
Whereas, 30 years after the enactment of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 
many businesses, public and private organi-
zations, transportation systems, and services 
are still not accessible to all individuals 
with disabilities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of inde-
pendent living for individuals with disabil-
ities made possible by the enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); 
(2) encourages all people of the United 
States to celebrate the advancement of in-
clusion and equality of opportunity made 
possible by the enactment of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
(3) pledges to continue to work on a bipar-
tisan basis to identify and address the re-
maining barriers that undermine the na-
tional goals of equality of opportunity, inde-
pendent living, economic self-sufficiency, 
and full participation for individuals with 
disabilities, including by focusing on individ-
uals with disabilities that remain segregated 
in institutions; 
(4) pledges to work with States to improve 
access to home- and community-based serv-
ices for individuals with disabilities; and 
(5) calls on the Department of Health and 
Human Services to provide information, re-
sources, and technical assistance regarding 
home- and community-based services and 
supports that enable individuals with dis-
abilities to live independently.

Mr. COONS, and Mrs. MURRAY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which

Whereas the week of April 6, 2020, is Na-

Whereas the theme for National Public

Whereas the goal of National Public Health 
Week in 2020 is to recognize the contribu-
tions of public health in— 
(1) improving the health of the people of 
the United States; and 
(2) achieving health equity; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, the United States and the 
global community are responding to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, which requires support 
for— 
(1) a robust public health workforce; 
(2) State, territorial, local, and Tribal 
health departments, health care workers, 
public health laboratories, and first respond-
ers; 
(3) diagnostic testing of new and potential 
COVID–19 cases and activities related to epi-
demiology and public health data; 
(4) 
complying

appropriate 
social 
distancing and quarantine recommendations; 
(5) relieving financial burdens for individ-
uals in the United States hurt by the

ernment, 
State 
and 
local

port public health measures to decrease com-
munity spread of COVID–19; and 
(8) investment in the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, which support infec-
tious disease outbreak preparedness and crit-
ical public health infrastructure for State 
and local health departments and public 
health laboratories; 
Whereas, in 2018, the life expectancy for 
the population of the United States slightly 
increased for the first time in 4 years;

Whereas there are significant differences 
in the health status of individuals living in 
the most healthy States and those living in 
the least healthy States, including dif-
ferences in obesity rates, the prevalence of 
chronic disease, and the prevalence of infec-
tious disease; 
Whereas racial and ethnic minority popu-
lations in the United States continue to ex-
perience disparities in the burden of illness 
and death, as compared with the entire popu-
lation of the United States; 
Whereas violence is a leading cause of pre-
mature death, and it is estimated that more 
than 7 individuals per hour die a violent 
death in the United States; 
Whereas deaths from homicides cost the 
economy of the United States billions of dol-
lars, and the violence of homicides can cause 
social and emotional distress, community 
trauma, injury, disability, depression, anx-
iety, and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Whereas emergency department visits for 
suicidal thoughts or self-harm increased 25.5 
percent between January 2017 and December 
2018, with substantial increases occurring in 
younger age groups; 
Whereas an estimated 1 in 7 children in the 
United States experiences child abuse and 
neglect, which imposes an annual lifetime 
economic 
burden 
of 
approximately 
$428,000,000,000 on the population of the 
United States; 
Whereas, despite significant progress in re-
ducing the infant mortality rate in the 
United States to a historic low of 5.8 infant 
deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017, the infant 
mortality rate in the United States greatly 
varies among States; 
Whereas women die from pregnancy-re-
lated complications in the United States at a 
higher rate than in many other developed 
countries, and an estimated 60 percent of 
maternal deaths in the United States are 
preventable; 
Whereas, although overall drug overdose 
deaths in the United States decreased 4.1 
percent between 2017 and 2018, drug overdose 
deaths attributed to synthetic opioids, in-
cluding fentanyl, increased by 10 percent 
during the same time period; 
Whereas cigarette smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable disease and death in the 
United States, accounting for more than 
480,000 deaths every year, including more 
than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand 
smoke; 
Whereas the percentage of adults in the 
United States who smoke cigarettes has de-
creased from 20.9 percent of the population 
in 2005 to 13.7 percent of the population in 
2018; 
Whereas, according to data from the Na-
tional Youth Tobacco Survey, between 2017 
and 2019, e-cigarette use— 
(1) more than doubled among high school 
students, rising from 11.7 percent to 27.5 per-
cent; and 
(2) tripled among middle school students, 
rising from 3.3 percent to 10.5 percent; 
Whereas, in 2016, fine particulate air pollu-
tion led to more than 64,000 premature 
deaths in the United States, and Black and 
Hispanic minorities were disproportionately 
impacted; 
Whereas public health organizations use 
National Public Health Week to educate pub-
lic policymakers and public health profes-
sionals on issues that are important to im-
proving the health of the people of the 
United States; 
Whereas studies show that small strategic 
investments in disease prevention can result 
in significant savings in health care costs; 
Whereas vaccination is one of the most sig-
nificant public health achievements in his-
tory and has resulted in substantial de-
creases in— 
(1) the number of cases, hospitalizations, 
and deaths associated with vaccine-prevent-
able diseases; and 
(2) health care costs associated with vac-
cine-preventable diseases; 
Whereas each 10 percent increase in local 
public health spending contributes to a— 
(1) 6.9 percent decrease in infant deaths; 
(2) 3.2 percent decrease in deaths related to 
cardiovascular disease; 
(3) 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to di-
abetes; and 
(4) 1.1 percent decrease in cancer-related 
deaths; 
Whereas public health professionals help 
communities prevent, prepare for, mitigate, 
and recover from the impact of a full range 
of health threats, including— 
(1) disease outbreaks, such as the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
(2) natural disasters, such as wildfires, 
flooding, and severe storms; and 
(3) others disasters, including disasters 
caused by human activity and public health 
emergencies; 
Whereas public health professionals col-
laborate with partners outside of the health 
sector, including city planners, transpor-
tation officials, education officials, and pri-
vate sector businesses, recognizing that 
other sectors can influence health outcomes; 
Whereas, in communities across the United 
States, individuals are changing the way 
they care for their health by avoiding to-
bacco use, eating healthier, increasing phys-
ical activity, and preventing unintentional 
injuries at home and in the workplace; and 
Whereas efforts to adequately support pub-
lic health and the prevention of disease and 
injury can continue to transform a health 
system focused on treating illness into a 
health system focused on preventing disease 
and injury and promoting wellness: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Public Health Week; 
(2) recognizes the efforts of public health 
professionals, 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
States, Tribes, municipalities, local commu-
nities, and individuals in preventing disease 
and injury; 
(3) recognizes the role of public health in— 
(A) preventing and responding to infectious 
disease outbreaks, such as the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
(B) mitigating short-term and long-term 
impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on 
the health and wellness of individuals in the

ties experienced by minority populations; 
and 
(D) improving the overall health of individ-
uals and communities in the United States;

in the United States; and 
(5) encourages the people of the United 
States to learn about the role of the public 
health system in improving health across 
the United States.

FINDINGS.—Congress

the efforts of the Antitrust Division of the 
Department of Justice to prosecute and 
deter the offenses described in paragraph (1). 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act, and 
the amendments made by this Act, is to 
strengthen public and private antitrust en-
forcement by providing incentives for anti-
trust violators to cooperate fully with gov-
ernment prosecutors and private litigants 
through the repeal of the sunset provision of 
the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhance-
ment and Reform Act of 2004 (15 U.S.C. 1

trust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and 
Reform Act of 2004 (15 U.S.C. 1 note) is
