PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
As the Members of the people’s House 
return to Washington, keep them safe 
in their travels. You know well the 
dangers confronting the citizens of our 
Nation: extreme weather events, ongo-
ing pandemic effects, economic distress 
and impending loss of employment, and 
even housing. 
Fill the Members with wisdom, pa-
tience, and determination to address 
these needs as so many dangers con-
tinue to close in on our communities. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER led the Pledge of Alle-

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GOMEZ). The Chair will entertain up to 
15 requests for 1-minute speeches on 
each side of the aisle. 
IN HONOR OF CORPORAL WESLEY 
A. RODD 
(Mrs. FLETCHER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor United States Marine 
Corps Corporal Wesley Alexander Rodd, 
who was killed during a training acci-
dent off the coast of Southern Cali-
fornia on July 30 of this year and was 
just laid to rest last Saturday. 
Born in Houston, he was a resident of 
Cypress for 17 years. Just 4 months 
ago, he became a father. After grad-
uating from Cy-Fair High School in 
2016, he enlisted in the United States 
Marine Corps, and he served as a rifle-
man with the Bravo Company. 
We are grateful to him for his service 
to our country—for his dedication and 
for his sacrifice—and it is fitting that 
we, the people he defended, honor him 
today on the floor of this House, in this 
Chamber. And as we do so, we honor 
the loss and the grief and the sacrifice 
of his wife, Jamie; his 4-month-old son, 
Ezra; his mother, Valarie; and all of his 
family, his friends, and his fellow ma-
rines. All Americans are forever in 
their debt—and he will be forever in 
our hearts. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which the yeas and nays are or-
dered. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6133, the STEP Improvement 
Act of 2020. 
Before I begin, I thank Ranking 
Member CHABOT for his dedication to 
small businesses and for his continued 
effort to ensure the Committee on 
Small Business works in a bipartisan 
manner. Staying true to the tradition 
of our committee, the bills we are de-
bating today are all bipartisan and 
passed through committee by unani-
mous consent, thanks to the coopera-
tion of Members on both sides of the 
aisle. I commend and thank all of the 
committee members for their work on 
those bills and their passion to put 
forth policies that make a difference in 
the lives of entrepreneurs. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s bill is one of 
those passion projects. After many 
hearings about the challenges and ben-
efits of exporting and trade for Amer-
ica’s business owners, this bill address-
es many of the concerns raised. It reau-
thorizes the SBA State Trade Expan-
sion 
Program—otherwise 
known 
as 
STEP—a proven and effective program 
that gives small businesses the tools 
they need to enter and thrive in the 
global marketplace. 
STEP has helped small firms export 
and access new markets, supporting 
$974 million in export sales in fiscal 
year 2019 alone. With the COVID–19 
pandemic continuing to decimate local 
economies 
and 
disrupting 
supply 
chains, the STEP program will be need-
ed now more than ever. It will help 
small businesses navigate the complex-
ities of an international marketplace, 
particularly as the country and world 
reopen for business. The STEP Im-
provement Act of 2020 funds STEP 
through fiscal year 2024 while making 
important improvements to modernize 
the program. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report 
that this legislation has the support of 
the State International Development 
Organizations. I thank its cosponsors, 
Representative FINKENAUER, who is 
also the chair of the Subcommittee on 
Rural 
Development, 
Agriculture, 
Trade, and Entrepreneurship; and Rep-
resentative SPANO, the ranking mem-
ber of the Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions, Oversight, and Regulations, for 
their continued bipartisan work to im-
prove STEP. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting to support H.R. 6133 
today, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6133, the STEP Improvement Act of 
2020. This legislation will authorize the 
SBA State Trade Expansion Program— 
or STEP—for the next 4 years. This im-
portant program facilitates small busi-
ness participation in trade missions 
and shows, international marketing ef-
forts, 
workshops, 
and 
other 
pro-
motional activities. 
The Small Business Act of 2010 au-
thorized the SBA to establish a 3-year 
STEP pilot grant initiative. The pro-
gram has two objectives: One, increase 
the number of small businesses that ex-
port; and, two, raise the value of exist-
ing small business exporters. 
The Associate Administrator of the 
Office of International Trade is respon-
sible for overseeing the program and 
awards, matching funds to States and 
territories for participation in trade 
missions, international marketing ef-
forts, workshops, export trade show ex-
hibits, and other promotional activi-
ties. 
The Trade Facilitation and Trade En-
forcement Act of 2015 renamed the pro-
gram the State Trade Expansion Pro-
gram and provided a $30 million au-
thorization through fiscal year 2020. 
The act allowed the Associate Adminis-
trator of the Office of International

Trade to give priority to STEP pro-
posals from States that have a small 
number of small businesses that export 
or proposals that would assist rural, 
women-owned, and socially or eco-
nomically disadvantaged small busi-
nesses. 
This legislation will improve the im-
plementation of the program by cre-
ating a standardized application proc-
ess, increasing grant spending flexi-
bility, improving communication be-
tween the SBA and States, and col-
lecting performance metrics and re-
porting to Congress. 
H.R. 6133 reinforces our commitment 
to seeing that the SBA fulfills its goals 
relating to the STEP program and 
maximizes every dollar to help small 
businesses reach their potential in the 
international market. The bill provides 
greater flexibility to State trade agen-
cies and enhances accountability at the 
SBA—a balance that will greatly im-
prove program functions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Iowa (Ms. FINKENAUER), 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
SPANO), for their leadership on this 
bill. And I especially thank the chair of 
the Committee on Small Business for 
her great leadership on the committee 
and the bipartisan work that we have 
done on this for such a long time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ and I have had the 
opportunity to work on the committee 
for many years now, and it is truly one 
of the committees in this Congress 
that works because it is bipartisan, and 
that is why we have been able to pass 
such important legislation and work so 
hard on the PPP and other programs 
over the years. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair-
woman, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield as much time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Ms. FINKENAUER), the sponsor of the 
bill and chair of the Subcommittee on 
Rural 
Development, 
Agriculture, 
Trade, and Entrepreneurship. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
for 
yielding. It is an honor to get to serve 
on the Committee on Small Business 
with her, and I appreciate her support 
as we dive into these issues that are 
obviously of big importance to me and 
to my State of Iowa. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why, today, I 
rise in support of the bipartisan State 
Trade Expansion Program Improve-
ment Act. 
As the Congresswoman from Iowa’s 
First Congressional District, I know 
firsthand that for our small businesses, 
the ability to access new markets and 
export goods promotes economic suc-
cess at home and in our communities. 
Given the importance of trade in my 
home State—especially for our farm-
ers, small businesses, and manufactur-
ers—I have made it a priority to im-
prove and strengthen the State Trade 
Expansion Program. The State Trade 
Expansion Program gives small busi-
nesses the tools they need to start ex-
porting and expanding into new mar-
kets. Many small businesses operate 
within razor-thin margins and have 
only a few employees. 
They don’t always have the resources 
to attend a trade show, design an inter-
national marketing campaign, or navi-
gate foreign countries’ complex rules 
and regulations. That is where the 
State Trade Expansion Program comes 
in. 
It is important that we reauthorize 
this program before it expires at the 
end of the month. At the same time, we 
also need to fix some of the program’s 
administrative challenges, which we 
have heard about from folks in Iowa 
and other stakeholders who have come 
before my subcommittee. 
b 1415 
In the Rural Development, Agri-
culture, Trade, and Entrepreneurship 
Subcommittee that I chair with Rank-
ing Member JOYCE from Pennsylvania, 
we held two hearings dedicated to bet-
ter understanding and addressing chal-
lenges with the State Trade Expansion 
Program. I also held a roundtable in 
my district to hear from the Iowa Eco-
nomic Development Authority, and 
small businesses have actually used 
this program. 
What we heard was that the State 
Trade Expansion Program is a great re-
source for our State, but we also heard 
about confusing application processes, 
tight timelines, and poor communica-
tion from staff at the Small Business 
Administration. 
That is why today, taking all of that 
feedback I have heard here in D.C. and 
back at home, I am proud we are here 
to pass the bipartisan STEP Improve-
ment Act of 2020. 
This bill would reauthorize the State 
Trade Expansion Program for 4 more 
years and make improvements; like 
creating a standard timeframe for ap-
plications; opening up more channels 
for input and communication between 
the Small Business Administration and 
the States; and collecting better data 
on how the program helps small busi-
nesses, which is the ultimate goal here. 
I want to thank Congressman ROSS 
SPANO from Florida, whom I worked 
with on introducing this bipartisan leg-
islation, as well as Congressman JIM 
HAGEDORN from Minnesota for cospon-
soring this bill. 
I will also note that this legislation 
passed through the House Small Busi-
ness Committee unanimously. I want 
to thank my Republican and Demo-
cratic colleagues for working together 
to move this forward. 
I urge all Members of this body to 
join Congressmen SPANO, HAGEDORN, 
and me in supporting this bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SPANO), 
who is the ranking member of the In-
vestigations, Oversight, and Regula-
tions Subcommittee. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I always 
appreciate coming to the floor to talk 
about the good bipartisan work that we 
do in the Small Business Committee. It 
truly has been an honor serving on that 
committee this term. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6133, 
the STEP Improvement Act of 2020, 
which reauthorizes the SBA’s State 
Trade Expansion Program, or STEP, 
for the next 4 years. 
The program helps small exporters 
expand their markets, grow their busi-
nesses, and create new American jobs. 
In fiscal year 2019, STEP helped 
small businesses export over $974 mil-
lion in goods and services, which yield-
ed a 54-to-1 return on investment. 
The program enhances State and 
Federal export efforts, facilitates co-
ordination of services, and expands the 
resources available to our Nation’s 
small businesses. 
Last year, the committee held a se-
ries of hearings to evaluate the STEP 
program. 
In March 2019, representatives from 
the U.S. Government Accountability 
Office and the SBA’s Office of Inspector 
General identified program manage-
ment weaknesses and recommended re-
forms. 
In June 2019, we received testimony 
from State administrators and small 
businesses that have successfully uti-
lized STEP funds. 
Our committee has carefully re-
viewed oversight reports and stake-
holder feedback to determine the ap-
propriate path in this reauthorization. 
With 
these 
recommendations 
in 
mind, H.R. 6133 streamlines the pro-
gram’s administration from the appli-
cation process to the reporting require-
ments. 
Thousands of our small businesses 
are competing in the global economy 
through the STEP program. Now more 
than ever, we need to support small 
businesses as our economy is recov-
ering. 
In my home State of Florida, more 
than 55,000 small businesses export 
their goods and services, and this pro-
gram will help them and their employ-
ees. 
In passing H.R. 6133, we maximize the 
potential of our small exporters. 
Thank you to the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Ms. FINKENAUER) for working 
with me on this piece of legislation and 
her commitment to bipartisan coopera-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the SBA’s STEP pro-
gram provides financial awards to 
State and territory governments to as-
sist small businesses with export devel-
opment. 
The financial support that STEP pro-
vides helps small businesses to learn 
how to export, participate in foreign 
trade missions and trade shows, and de-
sign international marketing products 
or campaigns. 
It is a commonsense, bipartisan piece 
of legislation. I urge my colleagues to

support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, small businesses are 
truly the bedrock of the American 
economy. Unsurprisingly, foreign mar-
kets are essential to their growth. 
While more and more of our local busi-
nesses are making inroads abroad, they 
are not without challenges. 
International trade has always been 
a complex undertaking, dependent on 
global macroeconomic trends as well as 
country-specific trade policies and re-
sources. 
Regardless, 
it 
is 
critical 
entre-
preneurs can compete in this market-
place. Doing so gives them access to 
more customers, which in turn fuels 
growth and generates jobs here at 
home. 
H.R. 6133, the STEP Improvement 
Act of 2020, will go a long way to ensur-
ing the recovery and success of our Na-
tion’s small businesses. By reauthor-
izing and modernizing STEP, this legis-
lation guarantees that States and their 
entrepreneurs will face fewer obstacles 
to participation and greater opportuni-
ties to expand their businesses through 
exporting. 
This bill is needed now more than 
ever as the world seeks to recover from 
the COVID–19 pandemic and subsequent 
economic fallout. 
Once again, I applaud my esteemed 
colleagues, Representative FINKENAUER 
and Representative SPANO, for their 
hard work on this legislation. 
I commend the ranking member and 
his staff for their commitment to ad-
vancing this legislation in a bipartisan 
manner through our committee. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6133. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
MICROLOAN IMPROVEMENT ACT 
OF 2020 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6079) to amend the Small 
Business Act to optimize the oper-
ations of the microloan program, lower 
costs for small business concerns and 
intermediary participants in the pro-

ments to the SBA’s microloan pro-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4345 
September 14, 2020 
Many entrepreneurs lack the experi-
ence as business owners, which is need-
ed to demonstrate their creditworthi-
ness to conventional lenders. We have 
heard 
time 
and 
again 
the 
heart- 
wrenching stories from entrepreneurs 
about the challenges they face, not just 
securing capital, but also operating 
their businesses. 
While the SBA has numerous pro-
grams designed to meet each of these 
challenges, the microloan program is 
unique in that it provides entre-
preneurs with both the affordable cap-
ital needed to start up and the tech-
nical assistance needed to boost their 
ability to succeed and repay. 
This program is a key resource for 
startup, newly established, and grow-
ing small businesses. It has provided 
millions of dollars in financing and 
technical assistance to small busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs since its in-
ception. 
By 
providing 
loans 
to 
nonprofit 
intermediaries, which in turn lend 
funds to the smallest of small busi-
nesses, the program helps borrowers 
streamline their operations, grow to 
profitability, and create new jobs. 
The microloan program was a critical 
piece of the puzzle to grow the Nation’s 
entrepreneurs before the pandemic. It 
is now more important than ever to 
strengthen and modernize the program 
as we face a sustained economic reces-
sion in the middle of a global pan-
demic. 
Earlier 
this 
Congress, 
the 
Sub-
committee on Economic Growth, Tax 
and Capital Access, under the leader-
ship of Mr. ANDY KIM, held a hearing on 
the microloan program where we heard 
from a panel of intermediaries who re-
ported that some of the program’s 
rules, largely unchanged since 1991, are 
outdated and restricting them from 
meeting today’s demand for startup fi-
nancing and providing more technical 
assistance. 
In response, Mr. KIM worked hard 
with 
Mr. 
BURCHETT
to 
craft 
the 
Microloan Improvement Act of 2020, a 
series of reasonable proposals designed 
to update the program’s rules and ulti-
mately help microloan intermediaries 
extend more affordable capital to first- 
time entrepreneurs. 
Just a few of the central changes in 
the bill include eliminating an out-
dated and onerous rule that has re-
stricted the ability of high-volume 
intermediaries to meet demand in their 
respective States, lowering interest 
rates for eligible intermediaries, and 
extending repayment terms in a tiered 
manner to provide greater flexibility 
to businesses. 
These changes are long overdue, and 
I am pleased that we are taking a vote 
on them today. 
Finally, I want to thank Mr. KIM and 
Mr. BURCHETT for their hard work and 
applaud their efforts to make bipar-
tisan improvements to this valuable 
program. 
I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ to all my col-
leagues in the House, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in order to assist small- 
dollar borrowers, the SBA offers the 
microloan program, where small busi-
nesses can receive loans of up to $50,000 
or less from nonprofit intermediaries. 
Beyond the financing support, the 
microloan program also requires these 
nonprofit 
intermediaries 
to 
deliver 
technical assistance and counseling to 
small business borrowers. 
This two-pronged approach has prov-
en again and again to provide lower- 
dollar borrowers a leg up in starting or 
sustaining their small businesses. The 
program registered record highs in fis-
cal year 2019, with over 5,500 loans ap-
proved for over $80 million. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. KIM) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) 
for working in a bipartisan manner to 
introduce H.R. 6079, the Microloan Im-
provement Act of 2020. 
This bill builds on the strengths of 
the program by introducing flexibility 
and more features for small-dollar bor-
rowers to utilize as they move through 
the microloan lending process. 
H.R. 
6079 
gives 
microloan 
inter-
mediaries the ability to offer lines of 
credit within the microloan program 
and increases the outstanding limit 
each 
microloan 
intermediary 
may 
carry from $6 million to $7 million. 
Additionally, H.R. 6079 replaces the 
outdated and burdensome one-fifty- 
fifth rule that prevents microloan 
intermediaries from accessing the pro-
gram in the first two fiscal quarters of 
each year with a reserve fund that en-
sures both large and small States have 
the ability to utilize the program. 
Finally, H.R. 6079 introduces a flexi-
ble grant process that has the potential 
to reward extra assistance to each 
microloan intermediary if overflow ex-
ists. 
I fully support this commonsense leg-
islation, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
speakers, and I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time for the purpose of clos-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support 
this 
bipartisan 
legislation. 
Microloans offered by the SBA serve 
our Nation’s smallest of small busi-
nesses. 
The increased flexibility this legisla-
tion permits will allow lenders and bor-
rowers to fully utilize the benefits of 
this program to the maximum extent 
possible. 
It is a good bill, and I would urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1430 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in its 
nearly 30 years, the SBA microloan 
program has enjoyed a track record of 
success in delivering affordable startup 
capital, particularly for women and 
minority-owned 
entrepreneurs. 
The 
SBA microloan program has helped to 
launch many successful businesses. 
As the chair of the Small Business 
Committee, I have had the privilege to 
hear about countless success stories, 
and I have fought tirelessly over the 
years to ensure all American entre-
preneurs have access to the SBA re-
sources they need to launch and grow 
their businesses. 
In my time on this committee, I have 
been proud to watch the microloan pro-
gram grow from a small pilot program 
to a robust lending program with 
strong stakeholder and congressional 
support. In many ways, the growth and 
success of the program mirror that of 
the many small businesses that got 
their start with an SBA microloan. 
Despite this success, and like any 
other Federal program, it must be peri-
odically reviewed and modernized. This 
bill does just that and ensures the 
microloan program will remain flexible 
for intermediaries and borrowers, help-
ing to ease access to the program for 
even more aspiring entrepreneurs. 
I want to applaud the work by the 
gentleman from New Jersey and the 
gentleman from Tennessee for their bi-
partisan work on the microloan pro-
gram. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6079. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I

Business Act to ensure that the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6021, the Northern Mariana Is-
lands Small Business Development Act. 
There are 1,700 small businesses with 
18,000 employees in the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, yet 
these businesses are the only ones in 
the United States that are ineligible 
for the SBA’s Small Business Develop-
ment Center, or SBDC, and Federal and 
State Technology, or FAST, partner-
ship programs. 
The SBDC program provides free or 
low-cost counseling and training serv-
ices to thousands of entrepreneurs and 
small business owners each year, and 
the FAST partnership program pro-
vides funding to increase the number of 
Small Business Innovation Research 
and Small Business Technical Transfer 
applications and better prepare appli-
cants for success. 
The Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, which rely heavily on 
tourism, has not been immune from 
the economic devastation resulting 
from COVID–19. Moreover, it has been 
trying to rebuild from two catastrophic 
typhoons that wreaked havoc on the 
country in October 2018. 
By extending SBA’s SBDC and FAST 
programs to the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, Congress 
will extend valuable opportunities for 
small business owners and aspiring en-
trepreneurs to receive support from 
qualified counselors on how to launch 
and grow their small businesses as well 
as recover from the economic catas-
trophes. 
In March, H.R. 6021 was unanimously 
approved by the House Small Business 
Committee, and I commend the spon-
sors of the legislation, Mr. SABLAN and 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN, for raising this in-
equity to the committee. 
The dedication they have shown to 
creating greater parity to the entre-
preneurs in all territories shows ex-
actly how small business issues are nei-
ther Democratic nor Republican issues; 
they are American issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join me in supporting the small 
business owners and entrepreneurs of 
the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands by voting in favor of 
H.R. 6021. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this extends a matter of 
simple fairness to American citizens. 
Currently, the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, part of the United States since 
1975, is the only U.S. jurisdiction not 
included for eligibility in certain SBA 
programs. 
According to the SBA, there are 
more than 1,700 small businesses in the 
Commonwealth that employ more than 
18,000 people. These businesses, these 
owners, these employees, and these 
families are no different than those in 
my hometown of Cincinnati or those in 
the chairwoman’s district in Brooklyn. 
This bill amends the Small Business 
Act to allow the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands to establish 
a lead Small Business Development 
Center, or SBDC, and to be eligible for 
the same funding as the other lead 
SBDCs across our Nation. 
Additionally, H.R. 6021 waives the re-
quirement that the new SBDC be estab-
lished at a higher education institution 
because the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands does not 
have a college or university to operate 
an SBDC on campus. 
The Northern Mariana Islands’ 55,000 
inhabitants deserve the same access to 
SBA programs as any other American 
citizen, and this bill ensures that they 
do. It is a very simple, bipartisan, and 
just piece of legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We have no further speakers on our 
side, so I am prepared to close. 
I would like the thank gentleman 
from the Northern Mariana Islands 
(Mr. SABLAN) and the gentlewoman 
from 
American 
Samoa 
(Mrs. 
RADEWAGEN) for their leadership on 
this issue. 
The legislation is long overdue, and I 
am happy to support the bill. I urge my 
colleagues to support the bill as well, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just urge support of 
this bill. It corrects an inequity, and I 
am so proud that, under my leadership 
and the ranking member, we are pro-
viding access to all the programs under 
the Small Business Administration for 
the small businesses in the Northern 
Mariana Islands. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, my legislation, 
H.R. 6021, ensures the 1,700 small busi-
nesses in my district can receive assistance 
through grants from the Small Business Devel-
opment Center (SBDC) program and through 
FAST, the Federal and State Technology pro-
gram. 
The Northern Mariana Islands is the only 
place in the U.S. not included in these Small 
Business 
Administration 
(SBA) 
programs, 
which help small businesses access the 
knowledge and capital needed to grow and 
compete successfully for federal contracting 
opportunities. 
H.R. 6021, the Northern Mariana Islands 
Small Business Development Act, would cor-
rect that by ensuring Marianas businesses ac-
cess to these SBA programs on the same 
basis as their counterparts across the nation. 
The Small Business Committee unanimously 
reported the bill favorably in March. 
Under my legislation, the Marianas can 
apply to establish a Lead SBDC, which would 
make available renewable funding to expand 
the reach and capacity of the existing SBDC 
service center on Saipan. With additional fund-
ing, small businesses on Saipan, Tinian and 
Rota will have better access to free or low- 
cost services such as incubator workspaces 
for entrepreneurs, business planning, oper-
ations, and other areas required for small 
business growth and success. 
H.R. 6021 would also help our small busi-
nesses participate in federal research and de-
velopment opportunities. The legislation does 
this by including the Marianas in the SSA’s 
FAST program which funds outreach and as-
sistance to small businesses interested in 
competing for the Small Business Innovation 
Research and Small Business Technology 
Transfer programs. 
I want to also express my support for H.R. 
6079, the Microloan Improvement Act, being 
considered by the House. The Act includes a 
provision from my bill, H.R. 2603, which pro-
vides Marianas small businesses owners ac-
cess to the SBA’s Microloan program. SBA 
microloans provide up to $50,000 typically not 
offered by banks for working capital or the ac-
quisition of materials, supplies, or equipment. 
The program also provides marketing, man-
agement, and technical assistance to assist 
the 
women, 
low-income, 
veteran 
entre-
preneurs in my district. 
I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 6021 
and H.R. 6079, so we can be sure that all 
small businesses in our country can fully ben-
efit from the SBA’s programs, regardless of 
where in our nation they happen to operate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6021. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bill before us today, H.R. 6078, the 
Microloan Transparency and Account-
ability Act, which makes it easier for 
rural-serving microloan intermediaries 
to provide technical and management 
assistance to entrepreneurs. 
One of the key components of the 
microloan program, and what I believe 
makes it so successful, is that inter-
mediaries offer technology, manage-
ment, and marketing assistance to 
business owners in conjunction with af-
fordable financing. However, when our 
Committee held hearings on the pro-
gram, we heard about the challenges 
that intermediaries in rural areas face 
in providing technical assistance. 
These nonprofit, mission-based lend-
ers must sometimes drive 2 or 3 hours, 
or even more, to a borrower’s place of 
business to conduct training. These ex-
penses 
all 
come 
out 
of 
the 
intermediary’s bottom line. 
The measure Mr. BURCHETT and Mr. 
KIM have put forward to make inter-
mediaries with at least 25 percent of 
their loans in a rural area eligible for a 
bonus technical assistance grant is a 
necessary one that I support and would 
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud our biparti-
sanship and, more importantly, our 
commitment to America’s small busi-
nesses. I urge all of my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank 
the chair, Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ, for working 
in a bipartisan manner on all four of 
these bills, and that is why both Re-
publicans and Democrats support all 
four, because we really are working to-
gether, and that is good for the coun-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, to enhance the dissemi-
nation of microloans in rural areas and 
to increase transparency, this bill, H.R. 
6078, the Microloan Transparency and 
Accountability Act of 2020, was intro-
duced by the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
In order to meet the needs of low-dol-
lar borrowers, the SBA offers the 
microloan program. As with all the 
SBA financial assistance program, the 
SBA does not make a microloan di-
rectly to a small business. Rather, it 
makes direct loans to a nonprofit, 
called a microloan intermediary. The 
intermediary, in turn, makes loans of 
up to $50,000 to borrowers and is re-
quired to provide technical assistance 
to its borrowers through a technical 
assistance grant. 
The 
average 
loan 
within 
the 
microloan program is approximately 
$14,500, and the program has grown 
from approving over 3,500 loans for a 
total of $52 million in fiscal year 2015 
to approving over 5,000 loans—5,532, to 
be exact—for over $81 million in fiscal 
year 2019. 
H.R. 
6078, 
the 
Microloan 
Trans-
parency Act of 2020, increases trans-
parency for the growing microloan pro-
gram and enhances microloan options 
for rural areas. Specifically, H.R. 6078 
requires the SBA to perform an annual 
portfolio risk analysis to examine de-
faults and charge-off rates to ensure 
taxpayer money is safeguarded.

Additionally, to enhance the dissemi-
nation of rural loans, the bill intro-
duces an opportunity for an inter-
mediary that currently makes at least 
25 percent of its loans to a small busi-
ness serving rural areas the ability to 
receive a 5 percent bonus technical as-
sistance grant. 
Mr. Speaker, I would again like to 
thank Mr. BURCHETT and Mr. KIM for 
working together to protect American 
taxpayer dollars and to ensure our 
rural communities have the ability to 
utilize this program to its fullest. 
Mr. Speaker, I fully support this bi-
partisan legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT). I thank him for his leader-
ship in pushing this legislation. 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ
and 
Ranking Member CHABOT for this op-
portunity as a freshman. It doesn’t es-
cape me that you all have allowed me 
to move forward with a meaningful 
piece of legislation as a freshman, and 
I can assure you that the people I rep-
resent thank you all very much. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
small 
businesses, 
whether in urban centers or rural 
areas, deserve access to small business 
administration resources. 
The Microloan Transparency and Ac-
countability Act is strong, bipartisan 
legislation that improves rural access 
to the SBA microloan program and will 
help 
ensure 
that 
community-based 
businesses, and not just the heavy hit-
ters, have access to needed resources. 
b 1445 
As a former local mayor, I know the 
difference that easy access to loans, 
even small ones, can make for our 
American mom-and-pop shops. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, rural 
small businesses often don’t get enough 
consideration 
from 
microloan 
pro-
viders. To incentivize interest in sup-
porting our rural small businesses, this 
legislation would establish a 5 percent 
technical assistance grant for inter-
mediaries who make 25 percent of their 
loans to these small businesses. Rural 
small businesses will have more oppor-
tunity to grow and innovate with the 
help of this legislation. 
This bill also improves transparency 
within the SBA microloan program so 
American taxpayers know their dollars 
are being invested responsibly. Under 
this legislation, Mr. Speaker, the SBA 
would update Congress with a portfolio 
risk analysis of microloans on an an-
nual basis. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill and the 
steps it takes to promote fair access to 
financial resources for every American 
small business. I am proud to work 
with my friend Representative KIM on 
this bill, and I thank him for his efforts 
to get it across the finish line. I also 
thank the chairwoman and the ranking 
member. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The recent growth of the SBA’s 
microloan program has shown how ben-
eficial it can be to small-dollar bor-
rowers. Not only does this bill make 
the program more valuable to small 
firms located in rural areas, it also in-
creases transparency and allows future 
Congresses with important information 
to help guide policy decisions. 
This is a bipartisan, good govern-
ment piece of legislation that deserves 
each Member’s support. 
I thank Mr. BURCHETT and Mr. KIM 
for their leadership. I once again thank 
Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ for, as al-
ways, working together with us in a bi-
partisan fashion. I very much appre-
ciate that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Oftentimes, the biggest barrier to en-
trepreneurship is accessing affordable 
capital. But for many entrepreneurs, 
access to expert advice can give them 
an added boost and the skills needed to 
grow a sustainable business. 
To that end, the microloan program 
leverages the network of nonprofit 
intermediary lenders, many of them 
CDFIs, who have deep roots in the local 
community, are committed to eco-
nomic development, and offer technical 
business and marketing assistance for 
these small businesses. 
This bill will go a long way in help-
ing these microlenders reach more 
small businesses in rural areas, which, 
in turn, will stimulate the local econo-
mies. It also mandates reporting on the 
program’s effectiveness so our com-
mittee can continue to oversee the pro-
gram and make necessary modifica-
tions to further improve the program. 
Again, thank you to Representative 
BURCHETT and Representative KIM for 
collaborating on the bill before us 
today. I also thank the ranking mem-
ber, Mr. CHABOT, and his staff for work-
ing with us in a bipartisan manner, not 
just on this piece of legislation, but on 
all the bills we have brought to the 
floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6078, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on the measure be-
fore us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The bill before us, the Congressional 
Budget 
Justification 
Transparency 
Act, is a commonsense, good govern-
ment measure every Member should 
support. 
It would require the congressional 
budget justification documents that 
agencies 
prepare 
for 
congressional 
committees to be posted online in a 
centralized, searchable database. 
This 
would 
make 
these 
detailed 
plain-language explanations of how 
agencies plan to spend taxpayer dollars 
more accessible to the public. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
MIKE 
QUIGLEY and DOUG COLLINS for their 
work on this bill. 
Representative 
QUIGLEY, 
in 
par-
ticular, has a long history as a strong 
advocate of transparency in the oper-
ations of the Federal Government. 
Representative QUIGLEY is the found-
er and chair of the bipartisan Congres-
sional Transparency Caucus, which 
shines a light on the importance of 
government transparency and account-
ability. 
This legacy of championing good gov-
ernment stems from his time serving 
as Cook County Commissioner where 
government reform was one of his 
major legislative priorities. 
H.R. 4894 builds on the work of the 
committee 
to 
improve 
government 
transparency by allowing the public to 
more easily learn how Federal agencies 
spend their taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4894, the Con-
gressional Budget Justification Trans-
parency Act. 
The Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act is a long over-
due reform to ensure that the Congress 
and the public can understand the full 
scope of the Federal budget. 
This bipartisan bill will make it pos-
sible for the public and every Member 
of Congress to readily find and compare 
the annual budget justification and 
supporting materials that each agency 
prepares and sends to Congress. 
Taxpayers should know how agencies 
plan to spend their hard-earned money. 
Last year, the Federal Government 
spent more than $4.4 trillion. 
We have transparency tools like 
USAspending.gov 
to 
track 
Federal 
spending after Congress appropriates 
taxpayer dollars. 
However, the annual Federal agency 
budget justifications provide detailed 
and plain-language explanations of how 
agencies plan to spend congressionally 
appropriated funds. 
In other words, an agency Congres-
sional Budget Justification provides 
the necessary details in context to ac-
tually understand how agency missions 
connect to eventual Federal spending. 
Currently, agencies send these plans 
directly 
to 
congressional 
appropri-
ators. 
However, if the rest of us wish to re-
view these valuable government budget 
materials, we are left to manually 
search through hundreds of individual 
agency websites. 
H.R. 4894 solves this problem by re-
quiring the budget justifications of 
every agency be publicly available at a 
central, single website. 
The bill would require the Office of 
Management and Budget to provide a 
comprehensive list of each agency’s 
budget justification with a stable link 
to where the documents are published 
on agency websites. 
This way Congress and the public can 
know that they are looking at the com-
plete picture of the budget request ma-
terials. 
Each agency would also be required 
to publish their materials at a consist-
ently named web address to further 
simplify the public’s discovery of these 
budget documents. 
The bill would also require the U.S. 
Treasury to centrally publish all mate-
rials themselves on USAspending.gov 
as open data. 
USAspending is a current one-stop 
shop for the public to find information 
on how the government is using their 
tax dollars. 
It tracks all Federal spending activ-
ity, as required by the 2014 DATA Act, 
which is an example of the strong bi-
partisan work the House Committee on 
Oversight and Reform and Congress has 
accomplished in the past. 
Adding 
congressional 
budget 
jus-
tifications to USAspending.gov for fu-
ture generations will provide greater 
context to Federal spending informa-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4350 
September 14, 2020 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania has no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss with-
out mentioning another interesting 
benefit of the Congressional Budget 
Justification Transparency Act. 
Thanks to another law that the 
House Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee has previously produced in the 
last Congress, the 2018 Good Account-
ing Obligation in Government Act, con-
gressional budget justifications also 
list unimplemented inspector general 
audit and GAO report recommenda-
tions. 
Therefore, H.R. 4894 will also cen-
tralize documents containing valuable 
IG and GAO recommendations for the 
public and Congress to easily find. 
This will empower better oversight 
over a sprawling and complicated Fed-
eral Government. I hope we can con-
tinue to find ways to continue building 
on such good government reforms in a 
bipartisan fashion. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I likewise, urge 
passage of H.R. 4894, as amended, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4894, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand 
the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

CHARGING HELPS AGENCIES RE-
ALIZE 
GENERAL 
EFFICIENCIES 
ACT 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (S. 2193) to 
require the Administrator of General 
Services to issue guidance to clarify 
that Federal agencies may pay by 
charge card for the charging of Federal 
electric motor vehicles, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2193 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Charging 
Helps Agencies Realize General Efficiencies 
Act’’ or the ‘‘CHARGE Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PAYMENT BY CHARGE CARD FOR CHARG-
ING FEDERAL ELECTRIC MOTOR VE-
HICLES. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this Act— 
(1) the term ‘‘Administrator’’ means the 
Administrator of General Services; 
(2) the term ‘‘charge card’’— 
(A) means a card, plate, coupon book, or 
other means existing for the purpose of ob-
taining money, property, labor, or services; 
and 
(B) includes— 
(i) a card issued under the GSA SmartPay 
program; and 
(ii) a Fleet Services card; 
(3) the term ‘‘covered electric motor vehi-
cle’’ means a passenger carrier that is— 
(A) a passenger motor vehicle; and 
(B) an electric motor vehicle; 
(4) the term ‘‘electric motor vehicle’’ has 
the meaning given the term in section 601 of 
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 
13271); 
(5) the term ‘‘electric motor vehicle charg-
ing station’’ means a battery-charging sta-
tion that permits the transfer of electric en-
ergy (by conductive or inductive means) to a 
battery or other storage device in an electric 
motor vehicle; and 
(6) the terms ‘‘Federal agency’’ and ‘‘pas-
senger carrier’’ have the meanings given 
those terms in section 1344(h) of title 31, 
United States Code. 
(b) GUIDANCE.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator shall issue guidance to clarify 
that each Federal agency may, in accordance 
with section 1344 of title 31, United States 
Code— 
(1) charge a covered electric motor vehicle 
at a commercial electric motor vehicle 
charging station; and 
(2) pay for a transaction described in para-
graph (1) with a charge card. 
(c) ISSUANCE OF CHARGE CARDS.—Not later 
than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Administrator shall issue to 
each Federal agency a charge card for each 
covered electric motor vehicle of the Federal 
agency that may be used by an officer or em-
ployee of the Federal agency to pay for 
charging the covered motor vehicle in ac-
cordance with the guidance issued under sub-
section (b). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days within which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on the measure 
before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Sen-
ators GARY PETERS and ROB PORTMAN 
for their bipartisan work on this com-
monsense, forward-thinking measure, 
as well as Congressman RO KHANNA and 
ANTHONY GONZALEZ for championing a 
companion bill in the House. 
The SmartPay Program operated by 
the General Services Administration is 
the world’s largest commercial pay-
ment program, serving over 560 Federal 
entities. It also is used for the fuel, 
maintenance, and repair of the govern-
ment-wide commercial fleet. 
b 1500 
With that size and reach comes im-
pact and opportunity. SmartPay ac-
tively supports the goal of incor-
porating electric, hybrid, and hydrogen 
fuel cell vehicles into this fleet, yet it 
is not clear that it can be used to pay 
for charging electric vehicles. 
S. 2193 would reinforce this goal by 
requiring GSA to issue guidance clari-
fying that authorized Federal employ-
ees can pay for charging electric vehi-
cles using SmartPay, just as they can 
for refueling conventional motor vehi-
cles. 
The Federal Government must lead 
the way in embracing technology and 
innovations 
that 
address 
society’s 
gravest threats. Climate change is at 
the top of that list, challenging us all 
to do better. 
If we can rise to this challenge by in-
vesting in strategic industries, work-
force training, and solutions, we can 
rise from this crisis as a safer, strong-
er, more prosperous Nation. 
I am firmly committed to cutting- 
edge, solutions-oriented policies that 
support our progress toward a Federal 
fleet of the future that is clean, green, 
and efficient. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud S. 2193 for its 
important contribution toward this 
goal, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 2193, the Charg-
ing Helps Agencies Realize General Ef-
ficiencies Act, or CHARGE Act. 
The CHARGE Act would direct the 
General Services Administration to 
allow Federal employees to use official 
Federal travel charge cards to pay for 
electric vehicle recharging at commer-
cial charging stations. 
This simple change would help Fed-
eral 
Government 
employees 
take 
greater advantage of Federal electric 
motor vehicle fleet vehicles while trav-
eling for official business. 
By ensuring the government can uti-
lize expanding commercial charging 
stations, we can help drive down costs 
to the taxpayer and avoid the need for 
the government to buy and maintain 
more electric vehicle charging sta-
tions. 
If Federal employees must use their 
travel charge cards to refuel their tra-
ditional vehicles, they should also be 
allowed to use these same cards to re-
fuel or charge their electric vehicles. 
This is a commonsense and easy step 
toward modernizing the Federal Gov-
ernment and granting more flexibility 
to Federal employees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4351 
September 14, 2020 
As an added benefit, according to the 
Congressional Budget Office, this new 
policy will not cost the American tax-
payers anything to implement. 
Further, this new flexibility for the 
Federal Government and its employees 
to utilize electric vehicles could help 
bolster the American market for elec-
tric vehicles. 
As we have learned throughout the 
coronavirus pandemic, American man-
ufacturing is vitally important to our 
success as a Nation. By allowing the 
increased use of electric vehicles in 
America, we can secure all the Amer-
ican ingenuity and innovation that 
comes with the vehicles of the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 
2193, and I yield back the balance of my

workforce, systems, and data from the 
very real cyber threats posed by the 
commonplace, everyday devices and 
items that make up the Internet of 
Things. 
Since 2014, there have been more de-
vices connected to our networks and in 
use than there are people on this plan-
et. 
Our committee has conducted exten-
sive work this Congress to address the 
silent war of cyberattacks that Amer-
ican governments, companies, and citi-
zens face on a daily basis. Reports indi-
cate that 25 percent of those attacks 
target these types of devices. 
Without adequate standards and pro-
tections in place, these devices can be 
compromised, hijacked, and utilized for 
surveillance, disruption, denial-of-serv-
ice, or ransomware attacks. 
Currently, there are no national 
standards to ensure the security of 
these connected devices. H.R. 1668 
would establish minimum cybersecu-
rity standards for such devices that are 
owned by the Federal Government, 
based on guidelines set by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology. 
This bill will also require contractors 
or vendors to notify the Federal Gov-
ernment if devices in Federal use have 
a known or suspected security vulnera-
bility. 
H.R. 1668 recognizes that protecting 
our Nation from cyber threats is an on-
going interactive process that requires 
established baseline standards and con-
stant vigilance. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1668, the 
Internet of things, or IoT, Cybersecu-
rity Improvement Act of 2019. 
Our Nation’s use of technology has 
shifted dramatically in recent years. 
Internet of Things, or IoT, devices have 
found a way into nearly every aspect of 
our lives, work, and now government. 
A 
recent 
Congressional 
Research 
Service report cites market estimates 
that, by 2025, there will be more than 
21.5 billion internet-connected devices. 
IoT devices, such as smart TVs and 
appliances, home security systems, 
thermostats, and many other home and 
work devices, are now connected to the 
internet. This offers ever-increasing 
gateways into our most valuable net-
works through our weakest technology 
devices. 
We traditionally think of computing 
devices 
such 
as 
computers, 
smartphones, and tablets as our pri-
mary 
interface 
with 
the 
internet. 
These computing devices have securely 
designed, mature, and powerful oper-
ating systems. However, IoT devices 
normally have less computing power 
and, therefore, security capabilities 
than traditional computing devices. 
As our economy has embraced the 
convenience of IoT devices, we have 
also created more entry points to the 
internet and our networks for mali-
cious actors to exploit. For example, 
building elevators, HVAC, lighting, 
audio-video, fire suppression, and even 
security systems are now capable of 
being monitored and updated remotely 
through networks. 
IoT devices play an integral role with 
industrial and manufacturing infra-
structure as well. These systems can be 
potentially manipulated in a manner 
that can put our security at risk. 
With new technology capabilities 
come new cyber vulnerabilities that 
can be taken advantage of in unpre-
dictable ways. 
But why are we talking about IoT de-
vices here in Congress? Well, Congress, 
and the House Oversight and Reform 
Committee, in particular, have the re-
sponsibility to ensure appropriate over-
sight of the technology that our Fed-
eral Government procures and the se-
curity of our Federal networks. 
The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement 
Act will ensure that any security gaps 
in Internet of Things devices are prop-
erly and transparently identified by 
the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology. 
It then requires that the Office of 
Management and Budget develop and 
the Department of Homeland Security 
implement policies requiring Federal 
agencies to only procure IoT devices 
that can be securely incorporated into 
an agency’s information systems. 
It does this while ensuring that lead-
ing private-sector security standards 
are adopted and improved upon by the 
Federal Government. Such government 
and private-sector partnership is key 
to developing widely useful and effec-
tive security standards. 
Lastly, H.R. 1668 would ensure that 
proper disclosure mechanisms exist to 
report and fix newly discovered secu-
rity vulnerabilities related to the gov-
ernment’s use of IoT devices. 
In summary, this bill will help im-
prove the mechanisms protecting the 
Nation’s valuable cybersecurity infra-
structure as new technology devices 
are increasingly used by Federal agen-
cies. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
KELLY). Representative KELLY from Il-
linois is an outstanding member of our 
Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in October 2017, the IT 
Subcommittee held a hearing on cyber-
security of the Internet of Things. This 
hearing was largely held in response to 
the Mirai botnet, a massive Distributed 
Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack, 
which left the internet inaccessible for 
much of the East Coast. 
IoT devices have processing power 
and an internet connection, but often 
have little security and no built-in 
ability to be patched remotely. IoT de-
vices can range from your home rout-
ers, security cameras, and baby mon-
itors to smart appliances and indus-
trial sensors. 
During the Mirai attack, hackers at-
tempted to log in to common devices 
using 61 username-password combos 
that are frequently used as a default 
for IoT devices and never changed. This 
tactic gave them access to hundreds of 
thousands of unsecured IoT devices. 
This attack served as a wake-up call. 
In 2018, Lieutenant General Robert 
Ashley, DIA Director, described the ex-
ploitation of insecure IoT devices as 
one of the two ‘‘most important emerg-
ing cyber threats to our national secu-
rity.’’ This is why I urge my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation. 
During the hearing and subsequent 
process, we learned that the U.S. Gov-
ernment is purchasing these IoT de-
vices without a standard for security 
to prevent them from being used in 
such an attack or used as an unauthor-
ized access point to U.S. Government 
networks. 
Bipartisan and bicameral conversa-
tions necessitated the introduction of 
this legislation. 
H.R. 1668, the IoT Cybersecurity Im-
provement Act, aims to address supply 
chain risk to the Federal Government 
stemming from insecure IoT devices. 
By establishing light-touch, minimum 
security requirements for procurement 
of connected devices by the govern-
ment, this bill has two main focuses: 
ensuring the government is purchasing 
secure devices and resolving critical 
vulnerabilities to existing devices. 
Building upon the amazing work over 
at NIST, the bill has NIST-published 
guidelines on the appropriate use and 
management of Internet of Things de-
vices owned or controlled by a govern-
ment agency. At a minimum, it will 
address secure development, identity 
management, patching, and configura-
tion management for IoT devices. 
Following this, OMB will take these 
guidelines and issue policies and prin-
ciples consistent with the current law. 
To ensure these devices stay secure, 
this bill creates a coordinated vulnera-
bility disclosure program to receive in-
formation about a device’s related vul-
nerabilities. 
To improve U.S. cybersecurity and 
the security of American citizens, 
agencies would be prohibited from pur-
chasing devices that fail to comply 
with the minimum security policies 
and vulnerability disclosure guidance. 
b 1515 
Throughout the entire process, I have 
worked hard to ensure that the re-
quirements of this bill do not impede 
or conflict with the current and good 
efforts of NIST or CISA. Both agencies 
have been issuing excellent guidance 
on IoT devices and Coordinated Vulner-
ability Disclosures, and they should be 
commended for their proactive work 
and their engagement with me and my 
team during this process. 
This bill offers Congress the oppor-
tunity to secure our Federal infra-
structure from threats, both foreign

and domestic. We cannot wait as more 
devices are connected to government 
networks that could potentially be-
come part of a botnet or an entryway 
for hackers. 
I want to thank everyone: experts, 
industry leaders, civil society leaders, 
and my colleagues who made com-
ments and helped us craft a bill that is 
bipartisan and solves a real problem. 
Finally, I have been proud to have 
worked with my friend and colleague 
WILL HURD on this legislation. He has 
always been there when I needed a 
partner on IT legislation, and he has 
taught me a lot about technology. His 
absence from this Chamber will be 
sorely missed. 
I also want to thank Senators WAR-
REN and GARDNER for working with me 
on this legislation. 
This is a strong bill that I believe can 
pass both Chambers and be signed into 
law. I hope my colleagues will join me 
in supporting this important bipartisan 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. HURD). 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of securing the 
Internet of Things through the IoT Cy-
bersecurity Improvement Act of 2020. 
Every second of the day, more de-
vices are connecting to the internet, 
and the amount of data we put online 
through these devices grows. The Inter-
net of Things is the world in which all 
these devices and information live. The 
Internet of Things is the world where 
devices work together to make our 
lives easier. The Internet of Things is a 
world where we are always connected. 
IoT devices are improving our soci-
ety. IoT devices are improving our 
economy. IoT devices are improving 
healthcare systems, shopping experi-
ences, and just about every other as-
pect of our lives. The Internet of 
Things is showing just how innovative 
humans can be. 
But, like most innovations, IoT has 
the potential to be misused and abused 
by bad actors. 
The Director of the Defense Intel-
ligence Agency has called IoT devices 
one of ‘‘the most important emerging 
cyber threats to our national secu-
rity.’’ 
If our security practices for using the 
Internet of Things does not evolve as 
our use of it grows, then we will find 
out how innovative criminals, hackers, 
and hostile foreign governments can 
be. 
Securing the Internet of Things is 
something Congress can actually ad-
dress, and we are doing just that with 
the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement 
Act. The bill reduces the risks associ-
ated with introducing new devices into 
the Federal Government’s digital infra-
structure. We achieve this goal by es-
tablishing minimum security require-
ments for the supply chain that is used 
to purchase devices that will be used 
on government systems. 
The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement 
Act will ensure that taxpayer dollars 
are only being used to purchase IoT de-
vices that meet basic minimum secu-
rity requirements. We are taking sim-
ple steps to secure our supply chain 
and protect Americans’ personal data 
and information. 
We can take advantage of technology 
before it takes advantage of us, and 
one way we accomplish this feat is by 
passing this piece of legislation that 
will mitigate vulnerabilities that IoT 
devices might introduce into Federal 
networks. 
What we are about to do today 
wouldn’t have been possible without 
my friend and partner from the great 
State of Illinois, Representative ROBIN 
KELLY. We have had a lot of fun to-
gether and passed a lot of legislation 
together. 
I want to also thank the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform staff for help-
ing to perfect this legislation. If it 
weren’t for you all, we couldn’t have 
gotten to this point. 
I hope all of our colleagues join us in 
supporting this legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
has no further speakers, I am prepared 
to close. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We often talk about the need for gov-
ernment to be a responsible steward of 
taxpayer dollars. This responsibility of 
stewardship extends to safeguarding 
the public’s data and government sys-
tems. 
With H.R. 1668, we can take positive 
steps to secure the devices that con-
nect to and interact with our valuable 
Federal Government networks. These 
same networks enable critical govern-
ment missions and protect America’s 
valuable information. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 1668, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1668, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to establish min-
imum security standards for Internet 
of Things devices owned or controlled 
by the Federal Government, and for 
other purposes.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2575) to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure before 
us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I thank Representative MCNERNEY 
and former Ranking Member Meadows 
for introducing the Artificial Intel-
ligence in Government Act. 
As the Federal Government faces his-
toric challenges and resource con-
straints due to the coronavirus pan-
demic, artificial intelligence can pro-
vide innovative solutions to help agen-
cies fulfill their missions and is critical 
to broader IT modernization efforts. 
H.R. 2575 would codify the Artificial 
Intelligence Center of Excellence at 
the General Services Administration, 
advancing the acquisition and imple-
mentation of AI technologies through-
out the Federal Government by pro-
viding expertise, best practices, and 
support. 
The bill would improve cohesion and 
competency around Federal use and 
adoption of AI by requiring agencies 
that use or plan to use such tech-
nologies to submit a memorandum to 
the Director of OMB demonstrating 
compliance with relevant guidelines. It 
also would require the Office of Per-
sonnel Management to evaluate AI 
skills needed in the Federal workforce 
and to provide an up-to-date occupa-
tional series for these skills. 
If we are to maintain our leadership 
and competitive edge globally, Amer-
ica must prioritize these mission-crit-
ical capabilities and their strategic im-
plementation across Federal agencies. 
We also must ensure that AI is de-
ployed with an unwavering commit-
ment to cybersecurity, data security 
and integrity, ethics, privacy, and the 
protection of the constitutional rights 
of our citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2575, the AI in Government Act. 
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has the 
potential 
to 
improve 
our 
Federal 
workforce’s productivity and to solve 
complex government challenges. 
By responsibly increasing the utiliza-
tion of AI in the Federal Government, 
we can streamline burdensome admin-
istrative tasks and better allocate fi-
nite resources. AI can potentially save 
the Federal Government billions of dol-
lars and countless man-hours. 
Artificial intelligence tools can also 
free Federal workers from mundane 
tasks, giving them time for more chal-
lenging work. In fact, a Deloitte report 
from 2017 estimated that the Federal 
Government could potentially save 1.2 
billion employee labor-hours by auto-
mating certain tasks. That could po-
tentially save the Federal Government 
up to $41 billion, annually. 
AI can also improve Federal policy 
decisions by presenting new insights 
and improving the quality of informa-
tion available to decisionmakers. 
AI represents a force multiplier bene-
fiting the American people in an era of 
soaring Federal deficits and increasing 
complexity of various Federal agency 
missions and programs. The taxpayers 
should especially benefit from a smart-
er, more effective government. 
The good news is that the govern-
ment agencies are well on their way to 
realizing the benefits of artificial intel-
ligence technology solutions. A 2018 
survey by IBM found that nearly half 
of the responding Federal agencies al-
ready incorporated AI solutions. 
The Trump administration has al-
ready made advancement of AI a na-
tional priority. In February of 2019, 
President Trump issued the executive 
order on ‘‘Maintaining American Lead-
ership in Artificial Intelligence.’’ 
The executive order promotes na-
tional research and development ef-
forts, workforce training, and tech-
nology standards. However, it did not 
go as far as to establish the necessary 
accountability or governing policies

for Federal agencies using AI tools. 
But the AI in Government Act does, be-
cause, along with the potential of AI, 
there are attending concerns and con-
siderations regarding its ethical use 
which must be taken into account to 
maintain the trust and confidence of 
the American people. 
H.R. 2575 ensures proper oversight 
over the government’s increasing use 
of AI. The bill requires the Office of 
Management and Budget and the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy to 
issue a memorandum to agencies to in-
form the development of agency AI pol-
icy plans. These agency plans will pro-
vide greater insight into agency AI ac-
tivities and will ensure public account-
ability over how Federal agencies in-
corporate AI tools into their mission 
delivery and decisionmaking. 
Mr. Speaker, we must tap into the 
benefits AI has to offer, and, with this 
bill, we can do it with proper oversight 
and accountability. I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member and chair-
woman of the committee for their sup-
port of this bill, and all members of the 
committee. 
The work of the Federal Government 
impacts every single American. Artifi-
cial intelligence presents many oppor-
tunities for the Federal Government to 
be better able to serve all Americans. 
There are also certain risks that AI 
presents. As Federal agencies adopt AI 
technology, it is critical that they are 
equipped with the expertise and tools 
they need to succeed and that they ad-
dress the potential risks of adopting 
this technology. That is why this legis-
lation is critical. It will help Federal 
agencies scale AI adoption in a smart 
and responsible way. 
First, this legislation will create a 
Center of Excellence within the Gen-
eral Services Administration. The Cen-
ter of Excellence will provide a pool of 
AI experts within the Federal Govern-
ment that can help agencies adopt AI 
and will also help better coordinate AI 
adoption across the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Second, this legislation will require 
agencies to develop governance plans 
to guide their AI adoption and use. 
These governance plans must address 
privacy and civil liberties consider-
ations. The goal of these governance 
plans is to ensure agencies adopt and 
use AI in a responsible way. 
Third, this legislation will make it 
easier for the Federal Government to 
attract AI talent by establishing a new 
occupational series for AI experts. 
As co-chair of the Congressional AI 
Caucus, I have heard about the dif-
ferent ways in which the Federal agen-
cies are adopting and looking to adopt 
AI to improve their operations and to 
be able to more effectively serve Amer-
icans. Some of these include the Food 
and Drug Administration, the Depart-
ment of Energy, the Department of De-
fense, the USDA, the Veterans Affairs 
Administration, the Department of 
Labor, and the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. The AI in Government 
Act will enable these Federal agencies 
and others to scale AI adoption, while 
reducing and addressing the potential 
risks of using AI. 
I again want to thank Chairwoman 
MALONEY and the Oversight Committee 
staff for working with me and my staff 
on this important bill. 
I 
also 
want 
to 
thank 
Senators 
PORTMAN, HARRIS, and GARDNER
for 
their leadership on this bill in the Sen-
ate. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this legislation.

Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, artificial 
intelligence 
is 
leading 
to 
break-
throughs in productivity in industries 
across the Nation such as science, 
transportation, healthcare, and edu-
cation. The American people deserve a 
government that takes full advantage 
of modern technology in a responsible 
manner. 
H.R. 2575 will help assure the proper 
governance and oversight over the Fed-
eral Government’s use of a rapidly ad-
vancing 
and 
promising 
technology 
area. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 2575, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2575, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DEPUTY SANDEEP SINGH 
DHALIWAL POST OFFICE BUILDING 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5317) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 315 
Addicks 
Howell 
Road 
in 
Houston, 
Texas, as the ‘‘Deputy Sandeep Singh 
Dhaliwal Post Office Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5317 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DEPUTY SANDEEP SINGH DHALIWAL 
POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 315 
Addicks Howell Road in Houston, Texas, 
shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Dep-
uty Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office 
Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to

Dhaliwal Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
5317, to designate the facility of the 
United States Postal Service located at 
315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston, 
Texas, as the Deputy Sandeep Singh 
Dhaliwal Post Office Building. 
Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was born in 
Punjab, India, before his parents de-
cided to emigrate to Houston, Texas. 
Before joining the Harris County 
Sheriff’s 
Office, 
Deputy 
Dhaliwal 
owned a successful trucking business. 
It was his sense of duty and a desire 
to build a bridge between the depart-
ment and the Houston area Sikh com-
munity that compelled him to join the 
Sheriff’s office. 
He joined the force as a detention of-
ficer in 2009 and was later deputized 
and graduated to the rank of patrol 
deputy. He was assigned to northwest 
Harris County where he would stay for 
the rest of his career. 
Deputy Dhaliwal was the first ob-
servant Sikh to serve in the Harris 
County Sheriff’s Office and was one of 
the first observant Sikhs in Texas to 
receive an accommodation to observe 
his religion while serving as a police 
officer. 
He served with distinction and was a 
shining example of the important con-
tributions that religious minorities 
make to our country. 
Deputy Dhaliwal also spent countless 
hours volunteering for Sikh commu-
nities across the Nation. 
Tragically, he was shot and killed 
while conducting a routine traffic stop. 
He was only 42 years old and is sur-
vived by his wife and three children. 
Naming a post office in his honor is a 
fitting tribute to a man who served 
selflessly, made the ultimate sacrifice 
for his community, and left this coun-
try a better place. 
I would like to thank the honorable 
Member from Texas, Representative

H4357 
September 14, 2020 
FLETCHER, for this legislation to honor 
a dedicated public servant and trail-
blazer for the rights of religious mi-
norities. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5317 which would name a post office in 
my home State of Texas after Deputy 
Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal. 
Dhaliwal joined the Harris County 
Sheriff’s Office out of a sense of duty 
and a desire to build a bridge between 
the department and the Houston area 
Sikh community. He was also one of 
the first observant Sikhs in Texas to 
receive a policy accommodation allow-
ing him to wear the turban and beard 
associated with the Sikh religion dur-
ing his service as a police officer. 
After being promoted to the rank of 
patrol deputy, he was assigned to 
northwest Harris County. 
In September of 2019, Dhaliwal was 
shot and killed from behind during a 
routine traffic stop leaving behind a 
wife and three daughters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation honoring a 
local law enforcement hero, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from the great State of 
Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER). I congratulate 
my friend on this bill. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY for all of 
her efforts to bring this important bill 
to the floor of this House. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life and legacy of Deputy Sandeep 
Singh Dhaliwal. He was my con-
stituent, and he was killed in the line 
of duty nearly a year ago today on Sep-
tember 27, 2019. 
As we reach this sad anniversary for 
our community, I am grateful that this 
bill 
to 
pay 
tribute 
to 
Deputy 
Dhaliwal’s lasting impact on our com-
munity is on the floor of the House 
today. This legislation will designate 
the postal facility on Addicks Howell 
Road in Texas’ Seventh Congressional 
District as the Deputy Sandeep Singh 
Dhaliwal Post Office Building. 
Deputy Dhaliwal was widely regarded 
as a role model for Americans of all 
faiths wishing to serve their commu-
nities. He was the first observant Sikh 
to serve in the Harris County Sheriff’s 
Office, and he was also one of the first 
officers in Texas to receive a policy ac-
commodation to practice his religion 
while serving as a police officer. 
As my colleagues have noted, he was 
born in Punjab, India, but his parents 
soon decided to emigrate to Houston 
where Mr. Dhaliwal grew deep roots. 
He did have a successful business, but 
seeking to build a bridge between law 
enforcement and the Sikh community 
and the greater Houston community, 
he joined the Harris County Sheriff’s 
Office, first as a detention officer in 
2009 and one year later he was depu-
tized and graduated to the rank of pa-
trol deputy. 
He was assigned to district 5 which 
covers much of northwest Harris Coun-
ty, an area he would patrol for the rest 
of his career. Through his years of 
service, he improved law enforcement’s 
cultural understanding of Sikhs and 
was an outstanding example of the 
tireless contributions that religious 
minorities and marginalized commu-
nities make to our country. 
Deputy Dhaliwal was also known to 
have a giving heart, coordinating relief 
efforts after Hurricane Harvey and 
traveling to Puerto Rico after Hurri-
cane Maria to help a colleague’s rel-
atives. 
He volunteered countless hours for 
Sikh communities across the Nation 
serving as the director of homeland se-
curity for United Sikhs, helping to ad-
vise Sikh communities on dealing with 
potential hate crime threats, and advo-
cating for their religious rights. 
Deputy Dhaliwal is survived by his 
wife and three young children. He rep-
resented the very best of our commu-
nity. He worked for equality, connec-
tion, and community through his life 
of service to others. The senseless slay-
ing of Deputy Dhaliwal is a solemn re-
minder of the risks assumed by police 
officers daily in serving and protecting 
our communities. 
Renaming this post office facility in 
his honor will serve as a permanent re-
minder of Deputy Dhaliwal’s commit-
ment to and sacrifice for the commu-
nity that he lived in and served. It will 
show that we stand in solidarity with 
the people of Houston, of Harris Coun-
ty, and the Sikh community across the 
country as they celebrate the life and 
mourn of loss of this remarkable and 
selfless hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman 
MALONEY for her support of this impor-
tant bill, I thank my colleagues in 
Texas for joining me unanimously in 
bringing it forward as cosponsors, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ in 
favor of the bill. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 5317, and I yield back the balance

fornia, as the Petty Officer 2nd Class 
(SEAL) Matthew G. Axelson Post Of-
fice Building. 
Petty Officer Axelson was born June 
25, 1976, in Cupertino, California. He 
was raised locally and graduated from 
Monta Vista High School in 1994. 
Petty Officer Axelson attended Cali-
fornia State University at Chico and 
graduated with a degree in political 
science. He joined the Navy in 2000 and 
went on to earn a position as a member 
of its elite special warfare team, the 
SEALs. 
Only a few short months after he was 
deployed to Afghanistan, Petty Officer 
Axelson and two other members of his 
unit were ambushed and killed by 
enemy forces in June of 2005. The sur-
viving member of his team would go on 
to write the book ‘‘Lone Survivor’’ 
that depicts the courageous actions of 
the four SEALs on that day.

second highest military award for valor 
in the United States. Naming a post of-
fice in his honor will serve as a tribute 
to a true American hero taken from us 
far too soon. 
I would like to thank Representative 
KHANNA, a distinguished member of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
for this legislation to honor this Amer-
ican hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4672 which would name a Cupertino, 
California, post office after Petty Offi-
cer 2nd Class Matthew Axelson, a Navy 
SEAL. 
Petty Officer Axelson was born and 
raised in Cupertino. After graduating 
from college, he joined the U.S. Navy, 
eventually earning a spot as an elite 
Navy SEAL serving on SEAL Team 10. 
He was deployed to Afghanistan in 
2005 and served as part of a four-man 
special reconnaissance element that 
participated in Operation Red Wings, a 
mission 
to 
counter 
fundamentalist 
forces in the Kunar province of Afghan-
istan. 
On 
June 
28, 
2005, 
Petty 
Officer 
Axelson’s unit was assigned to kill or 
capture Ahmad Shah, a high-ranking 
Taliban leader in the Hindu Kush 
mountains. He and two other team 
members were killed in action as part 
of an ambush by enemy forces, but not 
until after the four-man group fought 
ferociously back against a signifi-
cantly larger force. Axelson continued 
to fight alongside his teammates after 
being wounded in the head and chest, 
but he ultimately succumbed to his 
wounds. Axelson was posthumously 
awarded the Navy Cross, the second 
highest military award for valor. 
The sole remaining survivor of the 
team wrote a book about the coura-
geous actions of these men called 
‘‘Lone 
Survivor’’ 
which 
was 
later 
turned into a movie of the same name. 
Mr. Speaker, Petty Officer Axelson’s 
actions are a profile in courage. I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on the measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5597 
to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 305 
Northwest 5th Street, Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma, as the Clara Luper Post Of-
fice Building. 
Clara Luper made her mark in a time 
when people of color could not even 
walk through the front door of Okla-
homa City businesses. She had a vision 
for equality, a heart for service, and a 
commitment to justice. She knew that 
Oklahoma and this country could be a 
place where everyone is treated with 
respect, dignity, and humanity. 
In August of 1958, Ms. Luper and 14 of 
her NAACP youth council students or-
ganized one of America’s first sit-ins 
when they entered Katz Drug Store in 
Oklahoma City to order a hamburger 
and a Coke. They were denied service 
but refused to leave. Though they were 
verbally and physically assaulted, they 
persisted. 
Within days of the sit-in, Katz Drug 
Stores integrated their lunch counters 
not just in Oklahoma City, but in three 
other States as well. 
Her initiative helped inspire the 1961 
Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-in at 
the Woolworth’s lunch counter, which 
fueled momentum within the civil 
rights movement. 
Ms. Luper continued her fight for 
freedom. She was arrested 26 times, in-
tegrated the history department at the 
University of Oklahoma by becoming 
its first African-American graduate of 
the master’s program and worked tire-
lessly across the State in pursuit of her 
vision for justice. We should com-
memorate this heroine of the civil 
rights movement by naming a post of-
fice in her honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable 
gentlewoman and my very good friend 
from Oklahoma, Representative HORN, 
for this legislation to honor a heroine 
of the civil rights movement. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5597, which would name a post office in 
Oklahoma after Clara Luper. 
Luper believed that Oklahoma and 
the United States should be a place 
where everyone is treated equally with 
respect. 
In 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP 
youth council students organized one 
of the first U.S. sit-ins at a Katz Drug 
Store in Oklahoma. They tried to order 
a hamburger and soda knowing that 
they would be refused solely because of 
the color of their skin. 
Though they were assaulted, they 
stayed with their cause. And within 
days, Katz Drug Stores integrated 
their lunch counters in Oklahoma and 
three other States. 
This sit-in helped inspire the 1961 sit- 
ins at the Woolworth’s lunch counter 
in Greensboro, which was a critical mo-
ment during the civil rights movement. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of 
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN). 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman 
MALONEY for taking up this important 
bill to honor Clara Luper and her sac-
rifice. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to urge 
passage of H.R. 5597, a bill to rename 
the downtown Oklahoma City Post Of-
fice in honor of Clara Luper. 
Clara Luper, known as the mother of 
Oklahoma’s civil rights movement was 
a teacher, a publisher, and so much 
more. On August 19, 1958, Luper and 13 
NAACP youth council students led the 
Nation’s first lunch counter sit-in at 
Katz Drug Store in downtown Okla-
homa City. 
These sit-ins inspired similar action 
across the south during the civil rights 
movement, including the Woolworth’s 
lunch counter sit-in in Greensboro, 
North Carolina.

When Luper and the NAACP students 
sat down at that lunch counter, they 
knew they would be refused. They also 
knew what was on the line. In Ms. 
Luper’s words, ‘‘Within that ham-
burger, was the whole essence of de-
mocracy.’’ 
Each day they returned to the drug-
store with more people asking to be 
served. Though verbally and physically 
assaulted, they persisted. Sitting in 
peaceful protest, their fearlessness and 
determination resulted in Katz Drug 
Stores integrating lunch counters, not 
just in Oklahoma City, but also in Mis-
souri, Kansas, and Iowa. And they went 
on to integrate lunch counters and 
businesses throughout Oklahoma City. 
Oklahoma City was ground zero for 
America’s civil rights movement, and 
we have a responsibility to share that 
proud history and make sure that the 
story of the Oklahoma sit-in movement 
is never lost. Renaming the downtown 
post office in honor of Clara Luper is 
just one small step we can take to 
honor those who struggled and fought 
for civil rights in Oklahoma and across 
the country. 
We have come a long way because of 
the sacrifices of Clara Luper and those 
who stood with her in the civil rights 
movement, but there is much more 
work left to be done. This bill will take 
a step forward but, to me, the best way 
we can honor Ms. Luper is to uphold 
her legacy through a commitment to 
justice and equity in our laws and poli-
cies. 
Today, 62 years after Clara Luper and 
the NAACP youth council students 
first sat down at Katz Drug Store to 
stand up for justice, she and the sit- 
inners are inspiring a new generation 
of Oklahomans to take action through 
peaceful protest, to challenge injustice 
and systemic racism. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope the Clara Luper 
Post Office can stand as a testament to 
her enduring legacy, her courage, and 
her historic fight for justice, and I urge 
passage. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 5597, and I yield back the balance

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days 
in which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
3847, to designate the facility of the 
U.S. Postal Service located at 117 West 
Poythress Street in Hopewell, Virginia, 
as the ‘‘Reverend Curtis West Harris 
Post Office Building’’. 
Mr. Speaker, Reverend Curtis West 
Harris was born in Dendron, Virginia, 
on July 1, 1924. After graduating from 
high school and the Virginia Union 
University in Richmond, he worked at 
Allied Chemical. 
After an executive order was issued 
to prohibit discrimination at compa-
nies that received contracts from the 
Federal Government, Reverend Harris 
successfully sued Allied Chemical for 
violating the order. 
Reverend Harris continued the fight 
for social justice and would be arrested 
more than a dozen times for acts of 
peaceful protest and civil disobedience. 
In 1960, he joined the national board 
of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference. He would eventually head 
its Virginia chapter for more than 30 
years. 
Reverend Harris was one of Reverend 
Dr. Martin Luther King’s top lieuten-
ants, joining Dr. King’s 54-mile march 
in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery. 
Reverend Harris continued to lead 
marches and engage in other forms of 
action for decades despite repeated 
threats against his life and his family. 
He later would be elected to the 
Hopewell City Council and became 
Hopewell’s first Black mayor in 1998. 
Reverend Harris died on December 10, 
2017, at the age of 93. He was buried in 
Appomattox Cemetery, the same ceme-
tery he fought to integrate in 1960. 
Naming a post office after Reverend 
Curtis West Harris would celebrate the 
memory of a civil rights icon who 
fought throughout his life for social 
justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished Member from Virginia, Rep-
resentative MCEACHIN, for this legisla-
tion to honor a civil rights leader and 
hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3847, which would designate a Virginia 
Postal Service facility as the ‘‘Rev-
erend Curtis West Harris Post Office 
Building’’. 
Reverend Harris was a native Vir-
ginian who attended the Carter G. 
Woodson High School and Virginia 
Union University. After college, Rev-
erend Harris began to work at the Al-
lied Chemical Plant in Hopewell, Vir-
ginia. 
He 
successfully 
sued 
Allied 
Chemical after an executive order that 
prohibited discrimination at companies 
that received government contracts. 
This began Reverend Harris’ lifelong 
fight for social justice. 
In 1960, he was sentenced to 60 days 
in jail for staging a sit-in at a seg-
regated drugstore. He also protested 
the segregation of Hopewell’s cemetery 
and swimming pool. He joined the 
Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference’s national board and would 
eventually head up the Virginia chap-
ter. 
During this time at SCLC, Reverend 
Harris became close to Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King and joined him on 
the 54-mile march from Selma to Mont-
gomery. 
Reverend Harris was an influential 
and well-respected member of the com-
munity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 3847, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

NORMANDIA MALDONADO POST

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3870) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 511 
West 165th Street in New York, New 
York, as the ‘‘Normandia Maldonado

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3870 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

SECTION 1. NORMANDIA MALDONADO POST OF-

(a)

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
3870, to designate the facility of the 
United States Post Office located at 511 
West 165th Street in New York, New 
York, as the Normandia Maldonado 
Post Office Building. 
When Normandia Maldonado came to 
the United States in 1960, she brought 
her love for the arts and her passion for 
serving the community. She began her 
career as a dancer and teacher while 
also becoming actively involved in the 
Washington Heights community as an 
activist and a leader. 
Ms. Maldonado promoted Dominican 
culture in New York City and was a 
pioneer in the development of Domini-
can history in the United States. She 
cofounded the second oldest Dominican 
cultural institution in New York, the 
Instituto Duartiano of the United 
States. 
Ms. Maldonado also founded a ballet 
company, Casandra Damiron Hall of 
Fame, and was a founding member of 
the Dominican Day Parade. 
Ms. Maldonado was an artist, activ-
ist, leader, and legend who made piv-
otal contributions to the Washington 
Heights community, Dominican cul-
ture in America, and all New Yorkers. 
I would like to thank my colleague 
and friend, Representative ESPAILLAT, 
a distinguished member of the New 
York delegation, for introducing this 
measure to honor a great artistic and 
community leader. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3870, which would name a New York 
City 
post 
office 
after 
Normandia 
Maldonado. 
Normandia Maldonado was born in 
the Dominican Republic, where she de-
veloped a love for the arts and a pas-
sion to serve her community. She took 
this love and passion to New York City 
in 1960, when she came to the U.S. to 
star in the Cuban film ‘‘Busquen A Ese 
Hombre.’’ 
She began to plant roots in the Wash-
ington Heights community and worked 
to promote Dominican culture in the 
area. She cofounded Club Civico y Cul-
tural Juan Pablo Duarte, which is the 
second oldest Dominican cultural insti-
tution in New York. She also founded 
what is now known as the Dominican 
Day Parade. 
Her 
contributions 
have 
impacted 
countless Dominicans and New York-
ers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 3870, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Normandı´a Maldonado, an icon 
of Dominican culture, and my bill H.R. 3870, 
which designates the U.S. Post Office located 
at 511 W. 165th Street in Washington Heights 
as the ‘‘Normandı´a Maldonado Post Office Fa-
cility.’’ 
Normandı´a Maldonado is renowned for her 
decades of artistic leadership within the Do-
minican diaspora of New York City, where she 
co-founded Club Civico y Cultural Juan Pablo 
Duarte, Inc., directed and released various 
films, and helped establish the Dominican Day 
parade. 
But, perhaps even more so, she is revered 
as a pioneering activist who was instrumental 
in the establishment of the Dominican popu-
lation within the mosaic of New York City. 
From the time she arrived in New York City 
in 1960, the Dominican diaspora leaned on 
her fiery yet elegant and inspirational char-
acter. 
And much like the United States Postal 
Service, Normandı´a ALWAYS answered the 
call to service, especially for the Dominican 
community and our fellow New Yorkers. 
She taught in neighborhood schools. 
She led efforts in the community to build a 
statue in honor of Juan Pablo Duarte, the Do-
minican Republic’s foremost founding father. 
And 
she 
established 
the 
Cassandra 
Damiro´n Hall of Fame to ensure that fellow 
Dominican artists’ accomplishments and talent 
receive the recognition they deserve. 
In the wake of the Administration’s unprece-
dented attacks on the Postal Service, I am 
honored to enshrine and underscore Ms. 
Maldonado’s altruistic spirit, fortitude, and 
commitment to public service via this designa-
tion at the facility on 165th Street. 
This will stand for decades in the community 
and hopefully come as a reminder—and per-
haps a mandate—to the Postal Service em-
ployees working there, who I know will weath-
er this Administration’s storm of punitive poli-
cies and will continue to dutifully serve the 
people of Washington Heights and New York 
City. 
I want to thank my friend and fellow New 
Yorker, Chairwoman CAROLYN MALONEY, for 
her help in bringing this to the floor, Govern-
ment Operations Subcommittee Chairman 
GERRY CONNOLLY, and the staff of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform for helping us 
through this process. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CASTEN of Illinois). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3870. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
5062, to designate the facility of the 
United States Postal Service located at 
9930 
Conroy 
Windermere 
Road 
in 
Windermere, Florida, as the Officer 
Robert German Post Office Building. 
Robert German was born in Bur-
lington, Ontario, on March 4, 1983. He 
moved with his family to central Flor-
ida at the age of 5. 
After high school and college at 
South Georgia College, he moved back 
to central Florida to work in airport 
operations. There, he regularly worked 
with security and local police depart-
ments, which inspired him to serve his 
community by pursuing a career in law 
enforcement. 
After graduating in 2007 from Semi-
nole State College Law Enforcement 
Academy, Officer German decided to 
serve the town of Windermere, where 
he hoped the tight-knit community 
would allow him to build personal rela-
tionships with fellow officers and resi-
dents. 
On the night of March 22, 2014, Officer 
German was shot and killed. His un-
timely death marks the first time in 
the history of the Windermere Police 
Department that an officer was slain in 
the line of duty. 
Officer German exemplified the best 
of Windermere’s police department. 
Dedicating a post office after Officer 
Robert German would honor his cour-
age and dedication to his community. 
I would like to thank the distin-
guished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. DEMINGS) for this legislation to 
honor a dedicated public servant taken 
far too soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5062, which would name a Florida post 
office after Officer Robert German. 
Robert 
German, 
affectionately 
known as Robbie, moved to central 
Florida when he was 5 years old. After 
graduating with a business degree, he 
began working in airport operations, 
where he coordinated with security and 
police departments. These interactions 
inspired him to become a law enforce-
ment agent. 
Officer German was shot and killed 
in the line of duty on March 22, 2014. 
Officer German’s courage, dedication, 
and passion for his community are to 
be commended. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

Dorothy 
Bruce 
served 
as 
a 
cryptanalyst with the U.S. Army Sig-
nal Corps’ Signal Intelligence Service 
during World War II. Dorothy Bruce 
served with thousands of other women 
as code breakers who were vital to the 
war effort in the Pacific. 
Dorothy’s unit was critical in discov-
ering the locations of Japanese ships in 
the Pacific, identifying and inter-
cepting enemy supply convoys and pro-
tecting the lives of countless American 
servicemembers. 
She passed away at the age of 99 last 
year. 
Naming a post office after Dorothy 
Bruce will serve as a bright example 
for women and girls pursuing careers in 
science and math and will honor her re-
markable service to the country in one 
of its darkest hours. 
I want to thank the honorable Mem-

Sworn to secrecy, Dorothy’s unit 
worked to disclose the locations of Jap-
anese ships in the Pacific. Her unit also 
identified and intercepted enemy sup-
ply movements. 
The contributions of Bruce and her 
unit were crucial in defeating the Axis 
Powers in the Pacific. 
Her story is featured in the best-sell-
ing book ‘‘Code Girls: The Untold 
Story of the American Women Code 
Breakers of World War II.’’ 
Bruce serves as a shining inspiration 
for women and girls pursuing careers in 
STEM fields. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER), the sponsor of this in-
credibly important legislation. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the remarks of the gentle-
woman from New York and the com-
ments of the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4975. 
Midlothian resident Dorothy Braden 
Bruce—or Dot, as she was widely 
known—embodied the true spirit of 
central Virginia and our Common-
wealth. 
In World War II, Dorothy’s work to 
break Japanese codes was one of the 
most pivotal Allied code-breaking ef-
forts in the war. 
Having been recruited by the mili-
tary to serve in a top-secret group of 
code-breaking women, she intercepted 
enemy movements, supply shipments, 
and potential threats to American 
servicemembers. 
For 70 years, Dorothy Bruce kept her 
story a secret. She had sworn an oath 
of secrecy. It wasn’t until an author 
reached out to her a few years ago that

she learned that she could finally talk 
about her by-then declassified work in 
the service of our country. It was at 
this time that even her grown children 
first learned of their mother’s pivotal 
work. 
Dorothy Bruce didn’t ask for credit, 
and she didn’t seek the limelight. She 
knew that she had protected the lives 
of American servicemembers in the 
field of combat, and she knew their 
families were prospering and growing 
in the following decades, thanks to the 
diligence of her top-secret code-break-
ing unit. For her, that was an achieve-
ment worth celebrating, though quiet-
ly and secretly. 
Meanwhile, Dorothy Bruce became a 
dedicated member of our central Vir-
ginia community. She worked as an ed-
ucator, and she raised a loving family. 
Last year, she passed away at the age 
of 99. 
This 
legislation 
honors 
Dorothy 
Braden Bruce’s life serving our country 
and her service to others across Vir-
ginia. 
Her story continues to inspire, and 
that is why I am working to make sure 
our community will always remember 
Dorothy Bruce’s story and the stories 
of her fellow women code breakers. 
My legislation would name the Syca-
more Square post office in Midlothian, 
Virginia, near where she once lived at 
the Spring Arbor Assisted Living, after 
her. 
With this bipartisan bill passing 
today, we are one step closer to future 
generations 
of 
trailblazers 
walking 
through the doors of the Dorothy 
Braden Bruce Post Office Building. 
I would like to thank every member 
of the Virginia delegation of the House 
for signing onto this bill at introduc-
tion in order to recognize Dorothy 
Bruce’s work. 
She was a trailblazer. Her ingenuity 
and her determination as a code break-
er did not just blaze a path for a gen-
eration of future code breakers and 
women in public service, but it saved 
thousands of American lives. 
b 1615 
For 
women 
pursuing 
careers 
in 
science and math and intelligence, 
Dorothy is a reminder of the pio-
neering contributions of women in 
these fields throughout our Nation’s 
history. 
Today, I would also like to thank 
Dot’s loving family for their work to 
amplify her story and reaffirm the im-
portance of the female code breakers of 
World War II. Their story is worth 
knowing and worth celebrating. 
This bill is just a small act to re-
member and recognize Dorothy Braden 
Bruce’s remarkable life of courage, 
dedication, selflessness, and service to 
country. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I also urge passage 
of H.R. 4975, and I yield back the bal-

The question was taken; and (two-

ALTHEA MARGARET DAILY MILLS 
POST OFFICE BUILDING 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2969) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 1401 
1st Street North in Winter Haven, Flor-
ida, as the ‘‘Althea Margaret Daily 
Mills Post Office Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2969 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. ALTHEA MARGARET DAILY MILLS 
POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 1401 
1st Street North in Winter Haven, Florida, 
shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Al-
thea Margaret Daily Mills Post Office Build-
ing’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Althea Margaret Daily 
Mills Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
2969, to designate the facility of the 
U.S. Postal Service located at 1401 1st 
Street North in Winter Haven, Florida, 
as the Althea Margaret Daily Mills 
Post Office Building. 
Althea Mills began her education in 
Pughsville, which was Winter Haven’s 
first 
Black 
community. 
When 
she 
moved at the age of 13 to Pennsylvania 
to live with her aunt, Ms. Mills was 
able to attend integrated schools be-
fore returning to Winter Haven, which 
was not integrated. 
In 1963, Ms. Mills filed a lawsuit 
against the Polk County Board of Edu-
cation. The result of the lawsuit al-
lowed her son to attend Winter Haven 
High School, which was all White at 
that time. Ms. Mills’ successful lawsuit 
would later be credited with the inte-
gration of all Polk County public 
schools. 
Ms. Mills was also the first Black em-
ployee of the United States Postal 
Service in Winter Haven. She later 
would manage the Florence Villa Post 
Office. 
Althea Mills passed away in 2008. 
Naming a post office after her would 
commemorate an unsung hero in the 
fight for desegregation in Florida and a 
trailblazer for civil rights who im-
proved the lives of countless students. 
I want to thank the distinguished 
gentleman from Florida for this bill to 
honor a great public servant and civil 
rights pioneer. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2969, which would designate the facility 
of the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 1401 1st Street North in Winter 
Haven, Florida, as the Althea Margaret 
Daily Mills Post Office Building. 
Althea Margaret Daily Mills had a 
crucial role in the desegregation of 
Florida. When asked about her motiva-
tion to challenge the Polk County 
Board of Public Instruction, Mills said: 
‘‘Our instructors were just as good, but 
some of my son’s textbooks would go 
to page 3 and then skip to page 35. You 
can’t learn like that.’’ This lawsuit 
eventually led to the public integration 
of all Polk County public schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 2969. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, 
Congressman SOTO, for this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2969. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed.

the 
United States Postal Service located at 602

Henry Turpin Post Office Building’’.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
4034, to designate the facility of the 
U.S. Postal Service located at 602 Pa-
cific Avenue in Bremerton, Wash-
ington, as the John Henry Turpin Post 
Office Building. 
John Henry ‘‘Dick’’ Turpin was a 
U.S. Navy sailor born in 1876. Over his 
distinguished and accomplished career, 
Turpin likely became the first African 
American qualified as a master class 
diver, in 1915, and one of the first Afri-
can-American Navy chief petty offi-
cers. 
Mr. Turpin’s three-decade career in 
the Navy included service during the 
Spanish-American War, the Boxer Re-
bellion, and World War I. During World 
War II, Mr. Turpin volunteered to 
make inspirational visits to Navy 
training centers and defense plants. He 
survived two Navy disasters: the sink-
ing of both the USS Maine in 1898 and 
the USS Bennington in 1905. 
Naming a post office after John 
Henry ‘‘Dick’’ Turpin would honor his 
distinguished service and unwavering 
commitment to our country. 
I would like to thank the honorable 
Member from Washington, Representa-
tive KILMER, for this legislation to 
honor this great public servant. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4034, which would designate the facility 
of the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 602 Pacific Avenue in Brem-
erton, Washington, as the John Henry 
Turpin Post Office Building. 
After a distinguished career serving 
in the Spanish-American War, the 
Boxer Rebellion, and World War I, and 
being disallowed from reenlisting dur-
ing World War II because of his age, 
Mr. Turpin instead volunteered to tour 
the Navy training facilities and defense 
plants to speak to African-American 
sailors. 
After his retirement from Active 
Duty in the Navy, Turpin worked as a 
master rigger in Bremerton, Wash-
ington. His service is to be commended, 
and because of that, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I also urge passage 
of this bill, H.R. 4034, and I yield back

was a deputy with the Lincoln County 
Sheriff’s Department, where he had 
been employed for 2 years. In the weeks 
just prior to his passing, he had com-
pleted training to become the depart-
ment’s DARE officer and educator. 
Prior to joining the Lincoln County 
Sheriff’s Department, he was a police 
officer with the Brookhaven Police De-
partment for 4 years. William enjoyed 
spending time doing youth and chil-
dren ministries, where he would often 
use his talents on the guitar.

Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was also a 
Purple Heart recipient.

ice.

Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2246, which would name a Mississippi 
post office after three brave citizens 
who died in the line of duty. 
Donald William Durr was a deputy in 
the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment when he was killed in the line of 
duty. Just prior to his passing, he had 
completed training to become a DARE 
officer and educator. He was also a tal-
ented musician and ventriloquist who 
enjoyed spending time with his family. 
James White had only briefly been 
employed with the Brookhaven Police 
Department when he died in 2018. He 
had previously been employed with the 
Lawrence 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Depart-
ment, and before that, he was a soldier 
in the Army National Guard and served 
our country in Operation Iraqi Free-
dom, receiving a Purple Heart. 
Zach Moak was a patrolman with the 
Brookhaven Police Department. He had 
previously worked for Wesson and the 
Lincoln County Sheriff’s Department. 
In his free time, he loved to spend time

Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of H.R. 2246, a bill to 
designate the United States Postal 
Service facility at 201 West Cherokee 
Street in Brookhaven, Mississippi, as 
the Deputy Donald William Durr, Cor-
poral 
Zach 
Moak, 
and 
Patrolman 
James White Memorial Post Office 
Building. These three men lost their 
lives in the line of duty, and with the 
passage of this legislation, we will en-
sure that their sacrifice is not forgot-
ten. 
Donald William Durr, age 36, died in 
the line of duty May 27, 2017. William 
was a deputy with the Lincoln County 
Sheriff’s Department where he had 
been employed for 2 years after serving 
as a police officer with the Brookhaven 
Police Department for 4 years. William 
is survived by his wife, one son, his 
mother, and his sister. 
James White, age 35, died in the line 
of duty September 29, 2018, by gunfire. 
James 
was 
employed 
with 
the 
Brookhaven Police Department for 3 
months and was previously employed 
with the Lawrence County Sheriff’s De-
partment where he worked many years. 
He was a soldier in the Army National 
Guard and served his country in Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom. James was also a 
Purple Heart recipient and was the fa-
ther of two. 
Zach Moak, age 31, died in the line of 
duty September 29, 2018, by gunfire. 
Zach 
was 
employed 
with 
the 
Brookhaven Police Department for 3 
years. He previously worked for Wesson 
and the Lincoln County Sheriff’s De-
partments. Zach enjoyed spending time 
working, helping people in his commu-
nity, and in the company of his family. 
President Ronald Reagan once said 
there could be no more nobler vocation 
than the protection of one’s fellow citi-
zens. No single group is more fully 
committed to the well-being of their 
fellow Americans and to the faithful 
discharge of duties than our law en-
forcement. Law enforcement we know 
lives by creed. That creed is to serve 
and to protect. In the performance of 
their duty, danger is a routine part of 
their job, and we, on occasion, lose 
some valiant men and women. 
Because of the sacrifice of these 
three officers, we want to make sure 
that their valiant deeds will never be 
forgotten. 
I hope you will join me in supporting 
this legislation to dedicate this post of-
fice in the memory of three heroes who 
gave their lives in honorable service to 
their community.

United States Postal Service located at 
171 South Maple Street in Dana, Indi-
ana, as the Ernest Taylor Pyle Post Of-
fice Building. 
Ernest or ‘‘Ernie’’ Pyle began his ca-
reer in media writing for Indiana Uni-
versity’s campus student newspaper, 
the Indiana Daily Student. 
Mr. Pyle took a job as a reporter for 
the La Porte Herald in Indiana, moving 
through a variety of publications, be-
fore working with the Scripps-Howard 
News Service where he covered avia-
tion and travel throughout the 1930s. 
But it was during World War II that 
Mr. Pyle made his greatest contribu-
tions to American journalism and the 
American war effort. 
Beginning in 1942, Mr. Pyle began re-
porting from the front lines of both the 
Atlantic and Pacific theaters of war, 
bringing the experiences and stories of 
soldiers back home to America. 
His simple storytelling style of writ-
ing and first-person perspectives en-
deared him to Americans back home 
and abroad alike. 
His reporting led directly to congres-
sional legislation that provided combat 
infantry with an additional $5 to $10 a 
month to compensate them for more 
dangerous positions. This benefit would 
eventually lead to the creation of com-
bat pay as we know it today. 
Through the course of the war, Mr. 
Pyle wrote and reported from the front 
lines in battles ranging from Anzio in 
Italy, to the beaches of Normandy on 
D-Day, to Okinawa in the Pacific. 
Near the end of the war on April 18, 
1945, Mr. Pyle was reporting on the 
U.S. Army’s 305th Infantry Regiment 
in the South Pacific when he was killed 
by enemy fire. 
Following his death, President Harry 
Truman stated, ‘‘No man in this war 
has so well told the story of the Amer-
ican fighting man as American fighting 
men wanted it told.’’ 
Ernie Pyle was awarded the Pulitzer 
Prize for journalism for his correspond-
ence in the war, as well as the Medal 
for Merit and the Purple Heart post-
humously. Today his legacy lives on 
through his depictions of soldiers in 
World War II.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4365 
September 14, 2020 
I thank the honorable gentleman 
from Indiana for this legislation to 
honor this American patriot and hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4734, which 
would name an Indiana Post Office 
after Ernest T. Pyle. 
Ernie Pyle was born near Dana, Indi-
ana. 
After 
graduating 
from 
high 
school, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval 
Reserve before attending Indiana Uni-
versity. At Indiana University he stud-
ied economics and journalism and 
wrote for the student newspaper. 
During World War II, Pyle served as 
a war correspondent. He reported from 
the front lines of both the Atlantic and 
Pacific theaters of war. His accounts 
from the front helped provide Ameri-
cans with valuable unseen perspectives 
of war. 
His reporting helped lead to the cre-
ation of combat pay. Near the end of 
the war in April 1945, Pyle was report-
ing on the island of Iejima when he was 
killed by a lone Japanese machine gun-
ner. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize 
for journalism, as well as the Medal for 
Merit and the Purple Heart. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BUCSHON). 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bill, H.R. 4734, 
which will designate the United States 
Post Office at 171 South Maple Street 
in Dana, Indiana, as the Ernest ‘Ernie’ 
Taylor Pyle Post Office. 
I was proud to introduce this legisla-
tion with the support of the entire In-
diana delegation to honor the life and 
achievements of a great Hoosier. 
Born in Dana, Indiana, on August 3, 
1900, Ernie Pyle was one of the most 
beloved and impactful war correspond-
ents in World War II. Beginning in 1942, 
Pyle began reporting from the front 
lines in battles ranging from Anzio in 
Italy, to the beaches of Normandy on 
D-Day, to Okinawa in the Pacific. It 
was here that he brought the experi-
ences and stories of the everyday sol-
dier back home to America. His simple 
storytelling style and first-person per-
spectives endeared him to Americans 
back home and abroad alike. 
While reporting from Italy, Pyle 
wrote in his column that our troops in 
combat should receive additional com-
pensation for risking their lives as he 
was doing, eventually prompting Con-
gress to pass a bill nicknamed ‘‘The 
Ernie Pyle Bill’’ that provided combat 
infantry with an additional $5 to $10 a 
month. This benefit would eventually 
lead to the creation of combat pay as 
we know it today. 
Near the end of the war on April 18, 
1945, Pyle was reporting on the U.S. 
Army’s 305th Infantry Regiment on the 
island of Iejima when he was killed by 
Japanese gunfire. Following his death, 
President Harry Truman stated, ‘‘No 
man in this war has so well told the 
story of the American fighting man as 
American 
fighting 
men 
wanted 
it 
told.’’ 
Ernie Pyle was awarded the Pulitzer 
Prize for journalism for his war cor-
respondence as well as the Medal for 
Merit and the Purple Heart post-
humously. 
Today his legacy lives on through the 
work of dedicated nonprofit organiza-
tions and in museums and libraries, 
such as the Ernie Pyle Library in New 
Mexico that has been designated a na-
tional historic landmark and the Ernie 
Pyle World War II Museum in his home 
town of Dana, Indiana, in my congres-
sional district. 
I am grateful to this body for taking 
up this legislation to honor the legacy 
of a great Hoosier and an American 
hero. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4734, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4734. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

States Postal Service located at 340 
Wetmore Avenue in Grand River, Ohio, 
as the ‘‘Lance Corporal Andy ‘Ace’ 
Nowacki Post Office’’.

poral Andy ‘Ace’ Nowacki Post Office’’.

and the gentleman from Texas (Mr.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3275 
to designate the facility of the U.S. 
Post Office located at 340 Wetmore Av-
enue, Grand River, Ohio, as the Lance 
Corporal Andy ‘Ace’ Nowacki Post Of-
fice Building. 
Andrew, known as Andy or Ace to 
those who knew him, learned the im-
portance of duty, country, commit-
ment and community at a young age, 
as his parents had many friends who 
were police officers and veterans. 
Andy graduated from Brush High 
School in 1998 and joined the Marine 
Corps. 
Andy also attended the Cleveland 
Heights Police Academy becoming a 
patrolman for Grand River in 2001. He 
was a dedicated member of the Ready 
Response Team, the Honor Guard, and 
the Bike Patrol, always looking to pro-
tect and serve his community. 
b 1645 
On February 26, 2005, he was killed by 
a roadside bomb on his second tour of 
duty in Iraq. He was serving as a gun-
ner on a Humvee that was protecting a 
truck convoy south of Baghdad. 
Andy bravely served his country and 
community, and his memory in both of 
these roles should be commended. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished Member from Ohio, Represent-
ative JOYCE, for his legislation to 
honor this American hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 3275, which 
would name the United States Postal 
Service facility located at 340 Wetmore

Humvee that was protecting a convoy 
south of Baghdad. 
Andy was always looking to protect 
and serve his country and those around 
him. He served his country and his 
community bravely, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise humbled by the opportunity before 
this House today to help preserve the 
legacy of a true American patriot and 
local hero in northeast Ohio, the late 
Lance Corporal Andrew Nowacki. 
Lance Corporal Nowacki was trag-
ically killed in action on February 26, 
2005, while protecting his fellow ma-
rines during his second tour of duty in 
Iraq. 
He was just 24 years old. 
However, his dedication to protecting 
his community and serving his country 
made him a hero long before he gave 
the ultimate sacrifice in the name of 
freedom. 
Andrew, known as Andy or Ace to 
those closest to him, graduated from 
Brush High School in 1998 and signed 
up for the Marine Corps Reserves 
shortly thereafter. 
He later attended the Cleveland 
Heights Police Academy and joined the 
Grand River Police Department in 2001. 
Always looking to protect and serve 
others, Andy was a dedicated member 
of the ready response team, the honor 
guard, and the bike patrol. 
Andy’s commitment to community, 
dedication to service, and desire to 
help others is something we should for-
ever honor, and his sacrifice is some-
thing we should never forget. 
My bill, H.R. 3275, would rename the 
United States Post Office in Grand 
River, Ohio, the Lance Corporal Andy 
‘Ace’ Nowacki Post Office, ensuring he 
will forever be remembered by the 
community he cared so deeply for and 
contributed so much to. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
help preserve Andy’s legacy and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3275. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I also urge passage 
of H.R. 3275, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3275. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed.

DR. C.O. SIMPKINS, SR., POST

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5384) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 100 
Crosby Street in Mansfield, Louisiana, 
as the ‘‘Dr. C.O. Simpkins, Sr., Post Of-
fice’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5384 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DR. C.O. SIMPKINS, SR., POST OFFICE.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5384 
to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 100 
Crosby Street in Mansfield, Louisiana, 
as the Dr. C.O. Simpkins, Sr., Post Of-
fice. 
Born and raised in Mansfield, Lou-
isiana, Dr. Simpkins attended Wiley 
College and Tennessee State University 
for his undergraduate studies before 
earning a degree in dentistry from 
Meharry Medical College. 
Following his undergraduate edu-
cation, he joined the U.S. Air Force, 
obtaining the rank of captain before 
being honorably discharged. 
After his military service, he re-
turned to Shreveport, Louisiana, to 
open a dental practice. During this 
time, he became very involved with the 
civil rights movement and was a close 
friend of Dr. Martin Luther King. 
This drew the attention of racist or-
ganizations like the Ku Klux Klan, and 
his home and office were firebombed. 
Fearing for his safety, Dr. Simpkins 
moved to New York, where he contin-
ued to advocate for civil rights. 
After living in New York for 26 years, 
Dr. Simpkins returned to Shreveport, 
reopened his dental practice, and pur-
sued a career in politics. He won a seat 
in the Louisiana State House of Rep-
resentatives, where he served for one 
term before returning to his dental 
practice full time. 
He retired from his practice in 2011. 
Dr. Simpkins passed away on December 
4, 2019, at the age of 94. We are pleased 
to honor his legacy and memory by 
naming a post office in his honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
JOHNSON, the distinguished ranking 
member of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary’s Subcommittee on the Constitu-
tion, Civil Rights, and Liberties, for 
this bill to honor this community and 
civil rights leader. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 5384 to designate the fa-
cility of the United States Postal Serv-
ice located at 100 Crosby Street in 
Mansfield, Louisiana, as the Dr. C.O. 
Simpkins, Sr., Post Office. 
Dr. Simpkins joined the U.S. Air 
Force after school, attaining the rank 
of captain before being honorably dis-
charged. 
Following his military service, he re-
turned to Shreveport and opened a den-
tal practice. 
He became involved in the civil 
rights movement, serving with Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Unfortunately, 
his involvement drew the attention of 
racist organizations, such as the Ku 
Klux Klan, tragically resulting in his 
home and office being firebombed. 
Fearing for his safety, Dr. Simpkins 
moved to New York, where he contin-
ued to be an advocate for civil rights. 
After living in New York for 26 years, 
Dr. Simpkins returned to Shreveport, 
reopened his dental practice, and pur-
sued a career in politics. He won a seat 
in the Louisiana State House of Rep-
resentatives, where he served for one

ing at his dental practice until retiring 
in 2011. 
He passed away on December 4, 2019,

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as 
much time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4785 
to designate the facility of the U.S. 
Postal Service located at 1305 U.S. 
Highway 90 West in Castroville, Texas, 
as the Lance Corporal Rhonald Dain 
Rairdan Post Office. 
Rhonald Dain Rairdan was born on 
April 22, 1984, at Eglin Air Force Base, 
Florida. He was a 2003 graduate of Me-
dina Valley High School, where he was 
a member of the ROTC drill team. 
Dain was raised in an Air Force fam-
ily and lived in many different places, 
but he wanted to be a U.S. marine his 
entire life. 
Four months after joining the Marine 
Corps, Lance Corporal Rairdan was de-
ployed to the Middle East to join the 
Marine-led offensive to take control of 
Fallujah. 
Lance Corporal Rairdan’s unit was 
tasked with hunting for weapon stock-
piles and policing the damaged city as 
residents tried to regain a sense of nor-
malcy. 
On January 26, 2005, the helicopter he 
was onboard crashed near Rutbah, Iraq, 
killing 30. 
Dain died doing what he loved, pro-
tecting the United States. 
Castroville, Texas, was his adopted 
home, and naming this post office for 
him will allow the residents there to 
remember and honor his dedicated 
service. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable 
Member from Texas, Representative 
HURD, for this legislation to honor this 
American hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4785, which would name a post office in 
Castroville, Texas, after Lance Cor-
poral Rhonald Dain Rairdan. 
Dain, as he was called by his loved 
ones, was raised in an Air Force family 
and lived all over the country. 
He considered Castroville to be his 
adopted home, and it is where his cele-
bration of life would eventually be 
held. 
Dain grew up wanting to join the Ma-
rine Corps because he wanted to pro-
tect his country. Four months after 
joining the Marines, he was deployed to 
the Middle East to join the Marine-led 
offensive to take control of Fallujah. 
On January 26, 2005, Dain was on-
board a helicopter near Rutbah, Iraq, 
when it crashed. Twenty-eight marines 
were killed alongside Dain. 
He died serving this Nation and pro-
tecting us, a most honorable calling. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. HURD). 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4785, 
which will honor the bravery of Lance 
Corporal Rhonald Dain Rairdan, who 
died serving his country in Iraq. 
Dain, as he was called by his friends 
and family, grew up in an Air Force 
family, moving to and living in many 
places around the country, but his 
adopted hometown was Castroville, 
Texas. 
It was in Castroville that Dain joined 
the Air Force JROTC program at Me-
dina Valley High School. It was here 
that he realized his passion for service 
and, in 2005, joined the U.S. Marine 
Corps. 
According to his friends and family, 
being a marine was what he wanted to 
do his whole life. Four months after 
joining the Corps, Dain deployed to the 
Middle East, where his unit was tasked 
with hunting for weapon stockpiles and 
policing damaged cities as residents 
tried to regain a sense of normalcy. 
Tragically, on what was supposed to 
be his last mission before leaving Iraq, 
Dain and 30 other servicemembers were 
killed when their helicopter crashed in 
western Iraq. 
b 1700 
With that crash, we lost so many 
brave, incredible American patriots 
who embodied Semper Fidelis—Always 
Faithful. 
This was true for Dain especially. His 
commitment to his country left an un-
wavering impact on the lives of those 
who knew or served with him. He made 
his country, family, and friends proud. 
While his legacy will undoubtedly 
live on through his family and all those 
who knew him, the renaming of the 
Castroville, Texas, Post Office in his 
name will forever enshrine his love of 
our great Nation. 
I thank every one of my Texas col-
leagues for joining me in this bipar-
tisan 
effort 
to 
allow 
folks 
in 
Castroville to remember Lance Cor-
poral Rairdan, and I hope the rest of 
my colleagues in this Chamber will do 
the same. 
As we reflect on the bravery of one 
man who gave everything for country, 
let’s remember that our mission in the 
Middle East isn’t finished. He died for 
this mission, and we must ensure it is 
complete. 
God bless all of our servicemen and 
-women. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge pas-
sage of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4368 
September 14, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
4200, to designate the facility of the 
U.S. Postal Service located at 321 
South 1st Street in Montrose, Colo-
rado, 
as 
the 
Sergeant 
David 
Kinterknecht Post Office. 
Sergeant Kinterknecht was born on 
May 23, 1968, in Montrose, Colorado. 
His 
roots 
in 
Montrose 
run 
deep. 
Throughout his childhood, he attended 
public schools in Montrose and eventu-
ally graduated, in 1986, from Montrose 
High School. 
After graduation, he attended Mesa 
State College and Delta Montrose 
Technical College, where he trained 
and completed his education to achieve 
his lifelong dream of becoming a police 
officer. 
He worked for several different de-
partments, starting with the Telluride 
Marshal’s Office, the San Miguel Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office, and the Montrose 
County Sheriff’s Office. 
In the last 10 years of his career, he 
worked for the Montrose Police De-
partment, and he was also a volunteer 
for the Montrose Fire Protection Dis-
trict. In his free time, he was a member 
of the Montrose Area Fraternal Order 
of Police Lodge 56. 
Sergeant David Kinterknecht was 
shot and killed while responding to a 
routine domestic violence call in 2009. 
Two of his fellow officers were also 
wounded in the tragedy. He died at the 
age of 41, survived by his wife, two 
daughters, and three stepsons. 
Naming this post office after Ser-
geant Kinterknecht would honor his 
life of courageous, selfless service to 
his community and the ultimate sac-
rifice he made for the safety of others. 
I would like to thank the honorable 
Member from Colorado, Representative 
TIPTON, for this bill to honor this dedi-
cated public servant who was taken too 
soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4200, which 
would name a Colorado post office 
after Sergeant David Kinterknecht. 
Sergeant Kinterknecht was a law en-
forcement officer who was killed in 
2009 while responding to a routine do-
mestic violence call. 
This bill would repeal and replace a 
bill passed in Congress that named a 
mail processing facility after Sergeant 
Kinterknecht. This mail processing fa-
cility is not commonly used by those in 
Montrose. 
Instead, to ensure that Sergeant 
Kinterknecht is remembered as he de-
serves, Congressman TIPTON wishes to 
name a more commonly used post of-
fice after the sergeant. This would 
allow Montrose residents, including 
Sergeant Kinterknecht’s family and 
friends, to be able to see a post office 
named after him. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. TIPTON). 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4200. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
for the kind words in regard to Ser-
geant Kinterknecht and the sacrifice 
that he made on behalf of our commu-
nities. 
H.R. 4200 will make a technical cor-
rection to prior legislation signed into 
law to designate the primary USPS fa-
cility in Montrose, Colorado, after Ser-
geant David Kinterknecht, who was 
killed in the line of duty on July 25, 
2009. 
Sergeant Kinterknecht was born and 
raised in Montrose and graduated from 
Mesa State College and the Delta 
Montrose Technical College. 
His career in law enforcement began 
in the 1980s, and throughout his career, 
he served in the Telluride Marshal’s Of-
fice, the San Miguel County Sheriff’s 
Office, and the Montrose County Sher-
iff’s Office. 
Sergeant Kinterknecht was a re-
spected law enforcement officer, a dedi-
cated public servant, and a family man. 
His death was mourned throughout the 
entire State of Colorado, and the pas-
sage of H.R. 4200 will help preserve and 
honor 
the 
memory 
of 
Sergeant 
Kinterknecht in his community. 
I am grateful for the entire Colorado 
delegation signing on to this legisla-
tion to honor someone who gave his all 
for his community in support of all he 
loved. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 4200, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4200, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4200. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

RICHARD G. LUGAR POST OFFICE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (S. 3105) to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 456 
North Meridian Street in Indianapolis, 
Indiana, as the ‘‘Richard G. Lugar Post 
Office’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3105 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. RICHARD G. LUGAR POST OFFICE. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 456 
North Meridian Street in Indianapolis, Indi-
ana, shall be known and designated as the 
‘‘Richard G. Lugar Post Office’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to

Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of S. 3105, 
to designate the facility of the U.S. 
Postal Service located at 456 North Me-
ridian Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, 
as the Richard G. Lugar Post Office. 
Richard Lugar was born in Indianap-
olis in 1932. After attending high 
school, he studied at Denison Univer-
sity and Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. 
He then served in the U.S. Navy as an 
intelligence officer and returned to In-
dianapolis soon after. He first served in 
local government on the school board 
and then became city mayor. 
In 1976, Richard Lugar was elected to 
the United States Senate. While in of-
fice, he made significant bipartisan re-
forms to the farm program, started the 
biofuels research program, and pre-
served the Federal school lunch pro-
gram. 
Senator Lugar also left a mark on 
United States foreign policy. He served

34 years on the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, where he was a lead-
er in reducing nuclear, chemical, and 
biological weapons. 
With Senator Sam Nunn, Senator 
Lugar helped pass and implement the 
Nunn-Lugar program, which disman-
tled the weapons of mass destruction 
and their associated infrastructure in 
former Soviet Union states. 
Senator Lugar was also instrumental 
in the expansion of the NATO alliance, 
the creation of a program to end the 
global AIDS epidemic, and the ratifica-
tion of various antiterrorist treaties. 
For his lifetime of service, Senator 
Lugar was awarded the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom in 2013, and he held 
47 honorary degrees. 
Senator Lugar passed away shortly 
after his 87th birthday on April 28, 2019. 
Naming a post office after Senator 
Lugar would help honor his lifetime of 
public service. 
I would like to thank Senator BRAUN 
and Representative ANDRE´
CARSON, 
who introduced the House companion 
for this bill to honor Senator Lugar’s 
lifetime of work to save our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise to speak on S. 3105, a bill to 
designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 456 
North Meridian Street in Indianapolis, 
Indiana, as the Richard G. Lugar Post 
Office. 
Senator Lugar left the United States 
Senate as the longest serving Member 
of Congress in Indiana history. During 
his time in the Senate, he was inter-
nationally recognized. Senator Lugar 
was awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom. Her Majesty the Queen of 
England even bestowed on him the 
rank of honorary Knight Commander 
of the Most Excellent Order of the Brit-
ish Empire in honor of his work to 
make the world more secure from 
weapons of mass destruction. 
This House already passed the House 
version of this bill, H.R. 3152, last Octo-
ber. I thank Senator BRAUN for spon-
soring this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I just would like to 
urge my colleagues to support this bill 
unanimously. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of a bill to name a U.S. Post 
Office in Indianapolis in honor of Senator 
Richard Lugar, the former distinguished Sen-
ator from Indiana who passed away last year. 
S. 3105, follows my bill, H.R. 3152, a bipar-
tisan bill supported by every Member of Indi-
ana’s House Delegation, which was success-
fully marked up and reported out of Committee 
by a unanimous vote last year, and then 
passed by the House by another unanimous 
vote last October. At the time, it was a won-
derful start as we worked to celebrate Senator 
Lugar’s inspiring legacy. Now, it is an even 
more timely reminder of the importance of 
public service and comity—and the importance 
of recognizing the people committed to serving 
our country, each day. 
I was fortunate to know the late Senator 
Lugar, and I respected him deeply for his 
commitment to community and country. 
He understood what it meant to be a true 
public servant, and the values he expertly dis-
played have inspired my work in Congress 
since. 
He was a brilliant scholar, a brave member 
of our armed forces, and a dedicated public 
servant who championed people and principle 
over party. 
His distinguished life is a testament to the 
type of leader that Indiana cultivates. And his 
public service is an unquestionable example of 
his deep commitment to our country. 
That commitment to community and those 
values are the same as the ones that inspire 
the public servants working at the United 
States Postal Service. As this bill is consid-
ered today, I think it is both fitting and timely 
for us to reflect on the importance of the pub-
lic service done at USPS. 
At a time when public servants—especially 
Postal Service workers—are under attack from 
the current administration, this bill is a re-
minder of why we name our public buildings 
after the men and women who serve our na-
tion with distinction and honor. 
As the former Mayor of Indianapolis during 
the turbulent year of 1968, Richard Lugar 
helped lead our city away from violence after 
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., by working with Robert F. Kennedy, who 
broke the terrible news to Hoosiers gathered 
that day for a campaign speech. Those two 
proponents of peace over violence helped 
make Indianapolis one of the few major cities 
that did not erupt in painful destruction after 
Dr. King’s murder. 
Naming public buildings after a man like 
Senator Lugar is not only an act of commemo-
ration and celebration of a great man, but it is 
also a fine example for our youth and the next 
generation about the virtues of public service 
in a democracy like our own. 
Now, more than ever, the Postal Service will 
play a critical role in safeguarding and ensur-
ing an accurate vote tally—the absolute bed-
rock of a democratic system. 
I was honored to introduce the legislation 
that passed the House last year, and I remain 
proud to help add the late Senator Lugar’s 
name to a building that means so much for 
the public service and the democratic values 
we hold so dear. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
3105. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, due to my at-

dent, to discuss aid for the devastating 
wildfires that have recently swept through Or-

lowing manner:

Rules and Pass and No. 184, ‘‘yes’’ on Motion 
to suspend the Rules and Pass.

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE 
CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR

Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that I may hereafter be 
considered to be the first sponsor of 
H.R. 3114, a bill originally introduced 
by Representative LEWIS of Georgia, 
for the purposes of adding cosponsors 
and requesting reprintings pursuant to

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
ROSE of New York). Is there objection 
to the request of the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota? 
There was no objection.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 14, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on 
September 14, 2020, at 6:20 p.m.: 
That the Senate agreed to without amend-
ment H.J. Res. 87. 
That the Senate agreed to without amend-
ment H.J. Res. 88. 
Appointments: 
Commission on Combating Synesthetic 
Opioid Trafficking. 
Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Re-
view Board. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk. 
f 
HONORING COURAGEOUS 
SERVICEMEMBERS AND VETERANS 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today I stand here to honor 
and thank the courageous servicemem-
bers and veterans who have served and 
protected this Nation. 
I was appalled when the President, 
the Commander in Chief, referred to 
them as ‘‘losers’’ and ‘‘suckers.’’ 
These brave men and women sac-
rificed for us, some giving their lives: 
Veterans like my constituent JL 
Demps, Jr., a U.S. Army Specialist, 
who at 18 was deployed and had to 
leave his wife and 2-month-old son; 
Or Manuel Suarez Rodriguez, who 
was drafted out of high school to serve 
in the Army’s 2nd Infantry Division in 
Korea; 
Or Gary Malfield, a Comms Officer, 
who 
served 
in 
Vietnam 
reviewing 
heartbreaking messages on the status 
of Marines who were wounded or killed. 
Gary put it best by saying, ‘‘Many of 
them lost their lives, but none of them 
were losers.’’ I couldn’t agree more. 
They deserve better, Mr. Speaker, and 
should never be disrespected the way 
this President did. 
f 
HONORING MERLE T. SCHALL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Lieutenant Merle T. Schall. 
Lieutenant Schall was a member of 
the United States Navy from Elderton, 
Pennsylvania. 
On the evening of November 6, 1943, 
at approximately 2200 hours, Lieuten-
ant Schall took off for what would be 
his final journey. 
His plane was shot down while serv-
ing as cover and guidance for a ship 
below in the Pacific Ocean as he and 
his fellow Navy men approached Bou-
gainville Island in an effort to regain 
control from the Japanese who had in-
vaded the island the year before. 
Sadly, Lieutenant Schall did not sur-
vive. On Wednesday, August 26, I had 
the pleasure and honor of meeting Mi-
chael, Lieutenant Schall’s nephew, at 
the Indiana County Courthouse in my 
district. I was pleased to present Mi-
chael with his uncle’s much-deserved 
medals. Lieutenant Schall is a recipi-
ent of a Purple Heart, Air Medal, 
American 
Defense 
Service 
Medal, 
American Campaign Medal, Asiatic Pa-
cific Campaign Medal, World War II 
Victory Medal, the Honorable Service 
Lapel Pin, and the Gold Star Lapel 
Button. 
It was an honor to celebrate his serv-
ice and his life that he sacrificed to 
this country at the Indiana Courthouse 
that day. 
f 
IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
National 
Hispanic 
Heritage 
Month, 
celebrated each year between Sep-
tember 15 through October 15. 
This month provides our Nation the 
opportunity to recount the rich cul-
tural legacy the Hispanic community 
has made for our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4372 
September 14, 2020 
Due to the pandemic, the Hispanic 
Heritage Council of Western New York 
is holding a series of events virtually 
to chronicle the critical contributions 
the Hispanic community has made to 
Buffalo and western New York. 
This year, the Hispanic Heritage 
Council is also celebrating 10 years of 
work raising community awareness of 
the contributions our Hispanic friends 
and neighbors have made towards 
strengthening our community’s future. 
America is stronger because of its di-
versity. Our lives are enriched through 
a greater appreciation of other experi-
ences and cultures. 
We are thankful for the opportunity 
to spotlight the contributions of the 
Hispanic community this month and 
grateful to have the Hispanic Heritage 
Council of Western New York com-
mitted to this mission this year and 
every year. 
f 
HONORING COLEMAN CREST FARM 
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Coleman Crest Farm in Lex-
ington, Kentucky. This farm is one of 
Lexington’s oldest African-American- 
owned family farms with a remarkable 
legacy. 
James Coleman, the farm’s first 
owner, was born into slavery in 1845 in 
Uttingertown, Kentucky. Incredibly, in 
March of 1888, James Coleman pur-
chased the land he and his parents had 
worked on for years as slaves. 
The farm has passed through four 
generations of Colemans since that 
time, all while enduring and prevailing 
over racial discrimination, the Great 
Depression, and two world wars. 
In 
2001, 
James 
Coleman’s 
great- 
grandson, Jim, and his late wife, 
Cathy, purchased the farm. Tomorrow 
on September 15, Cathy Coleman’s 
birthday, a groundbreaking of a new 
house at the farm will take place dedi-
cated to Cathy’s memory. The farm 
will be used to help shape the future 
for Black farmers as Lexington youth 
are exposed to the agricultural oppor-
tunity as a means to realize the Amer-
ican Dream. 
I am honored to pay tribute to the 
entire Coleman family today in the 
people’s House. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JOHN HENRY 
TURPIN 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of John Henry 
Turpin, a distinguished U.S. Navy sail-
or and a lifelong resident of Bremerton, 
Washington. 
John’s 30-year career in the Navy in-
cluded service during the Spanish- 
American War, the Boxer Rebellion, 
and World War I. He is believed to be 
the first Black American to qualify as 
a master diver and was one of the first 
Black Americans to achieve the rank 
of Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Navy. 
John’s outstanding legacy of service to 
our country is made even more signifi-
cant by the era of prejudice and dis-
crimination during which he served. 
I am proud that today the House of 
Representatives unanimously passed 
the bipartisan bill that I introduced to 
designate the U.S. Postal Service facil-
ity on Pacific Avenue in Bremerton as 
the John Henry Turpin Post Office 
Building in recognition of his achieve-
ments and his service. 
It is fitting that today Democrats 
and Republicans stood together in hon-
oring his lifelong and selfless commit-
ment to the defense of America and 
American values, and in ensuring that 
his accomplishments are permanently 
remembered in the city of Bremerton. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MATTHEW WEBB 
AND WILLIAM GIANAKOPOLOUS 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize two brave po-
lice officers in my district for their 
outstanding actions and bravery. 
Sergeant Matthew Christopher Webb 
and Corporal William Gianakopolous 
exemplify the best of our Nation. 
Webb and Gianakopolous responded 
to a house fire and an armed man fol-
lowing a woman during the very same 
shift. 
At 1 a.m. on July 6, Webb and 
Gianakopolous helped evacuate resi-
dents and a family pet from a fire 
where they bravely went into the burn-
ing structure several times. 
Then at 5 a.m. on the same day, they 
responded to a call of a man following 
a woman where the officers found him 
hiding with two knives in his posses-
sion. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Officers 
Webb 
and 
Gianakopolous, 
exemplify 
courage, 
commitment and honor that our Na-
tion, State, and south Jersey deserve, 
and we thank them for their heroism. 
The virtue and integrity of the ma-
jority of our hard-working men and 
women in blue cannot go unnoticed, es-
pecially in these trying times. 
William and Matthew, thank you. 
May God bless you and God bless 
America.

COMMENDING WALTER PUDDIFER, 
TOM GARNER, HUGH LOFTING II, 
DAN 
DIGREGORIO, 
DAVID 
MAC-
DONALD, AND BURNETT H. WIL-
SON III 
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today before the House of Representa-
tives to commend Walter Puddifer, 
Tom Garner, Hugh Lofting II, Dan 
DiGregorio, 
David 
MacDonald, 
and 
Burnett H. Wilson III for their heroism. 
On Tuesday, August 4, in our commu-
nity of Chester County, amidst fast- 
moving floodwaters, these six men 
risked their own lives and saved a fa-
ther and children from sinking in a ve-
hicle. 
It is so important in these trying 
times to try to recognize the brave, he-
roic acts that everyday Americans are 
committing. 
This story is not an isolated incident. 
There are countless stories across the 
country of people stepping up to save 
lives: healthcare workers, essential 
workers, and, indeed, the average per-
son who sees somebody in need and 
drops everything to help. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank these brave 
Pennsylvanians, 
and 
I 
enter 
their 
names into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
for their selfless and courageous acts of 
service. 
f 
HONORING PAUL BECKHAM 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of an amazing leader, Paul 
Beckham, who sadly passed away on 
August 30. 
Paul was dedicated to improving my 
alma mater, Young Harris College, 
through his work on the Board of 
Trustees. He served as its chairman for 
8 years and improved the lives of 
countless students and faculty mem-
bers. 
Paul had a diversified background in 
business, marketing, sports, and fi-
nance that included television oper-
ations. 
Impressively, he served as Turner 
Broadcasting System’s president. He 
also served as president of Private Net-
works, Inc., which is the wholly owned 
subsidiary of TBS responsible for de-
veloping nontraditional television op-
portunities, 
including 
the 
Airport 
Channel. 
Remarkably, he was also chairman 
and cofounder of Hope-Beckham with 
Bob Hope when they purchased the 
events division of Whittle Communica-
tion LP of Knoxville. 
Paul was also a devoted member of 
his church, Peachtree Road United 
Methodist Church, and was active in 
multiple charitable and community or-
ganizations. 
His life was marked by service to 
others and working to improve the 
greater good. 
I am immensely grateful for the life 
he lived. He impacted countless indi-
viduals in all his pursuits, and I was 
grateful to know him. 
Paul’s family and friends will con-
tinue to be in my thoughts and prayers 
during this most difficult time. 
I know his legacy will remain for 
many years to come.

SUPPORTING ALTHEA MARGARET 
DAILY 
MILLS 
POST 
OFFICE 
BUILDING 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of our bill, H.R. 2969, which 
passed the House today. 
This bill names the Florence Villa 
United States Post Office located at 
1401 1st Street North in Winter Haven, 
Florida, as the Althea Margaret Daily 
Mills Post Office Building. 
Ms. Althea Margaret Daily Mills is 
an unsung hero in the fight for desegre-
gation in Florida. 
Ms. Mills began her education in 
Pughsville, Winter Haven’s first Black 
community. When she was 13, she 
moved to Pennsylvania to live with an 
aunt. There, she was able to attend in-
tegrated schools. 
In 1963, Mills filed a lawsuit against 
Polk County Board of Public Instruc-
tion to end the dual school system and 
allow her son to attend the then-all- 
White Winter Haven High School. This 
lawsuit eventually led to integration of 
all Polk County public schools. 
When asked about her motivation to 
challenge the system, Mills would later 
say: ‘‘Our instructors were just as 
good, but some of my son’s textbooks 
would go to page 3 and then skip to 
page 35. You can’t learn like that.’’ 
Ms. Mills was also the first Black ca-
reer employee of the United States 
Postal Service in Winter Haven and 
eventually became a manager of the 
Florence Villa Post Office, which will 
bear her name. 
Mr. Speaker, although she passed in 
2008, her legacy lives on, and I thank 
my colleagues for the support of this 
bill. 
f 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC TIMELINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, we are here today with the 
GOP Doctors Caucus for the next hour 
to discuss the COVID epidemic. 
It is my distinct honor and privilege 
to be down here with my colleagues for 
the first time in some time since the 
House has not been in session for quite 
a few weeks. 
Collectively on the floor tonight, 
there are over 200 years of clinical ex-
perience with the GOP Doctors Caucus. 
I myself practiced 37 years before I re-
tired and ran for Congress in 2008. 
Tonight, I want to go over the 
timeline just briefly of the pandemic 
that we currently are experiencing. 
Remember, about 81⁄2 months ago, we 
knew that there was a virus that had 
spread from China, from Wuhan, China, 
to the U.S. 
In that timeline, on January 9, the 
World Health Organization announced 
that there was a pneumonia in Wuhan, 
China. 
By January 20, three cities in the 
U.S. had already begun to limit flights 
and to check passengers from flights 
that landed in Los Angeles at LAX, at 
San Francisco, and at JFK Inter-
national. 
On January 21, the first confirmed 
case was a person who lived in Wuhan 
but came back to the U.S. 
By January 31 of this year, the Presi-
dent had stopped all flights from China 
to the U.S. and then subsequently, as 
we all know, from Europe to the U.S. 
So, literally, from not knowing what 
this virus was in the first month, what 
RNA sequence it was, we had limited 
the travel of this virus. 
Through the month of February, I be-
came involved with the Diamond Prin-
cess cruise ship. It turned out I had a 
very good friend on that ship. It was 
docked with 3,500 people onboard. The 
average age of the passengers on that 
ship was 75 years of age. 
My friend is a physician. I talked to 
him on the phone. 
I must give a shout-out to HHS, who 
really led the evacuation of that ship, 
bringing all Americans back home, 
quarantining them. Not a single Amer-
ican died, and I think we can take 
some pride in that. 
I am a former U.S. Army officer. I 
served in the 2nd Infantry Division in 
Korea. We were trained, and it was 
beaten in our heads, you do not leave 
anyone behind. 
I think a number that is left out is 
our U.S. State Department has repatri-
ated over 90,000 U.S. American citizens 
from overseas back home to the U.S., 
where they can receive the care that 
they need. 
We have recognized that we got the 
RNA sequence of the virus and lit-
erally, within 6 weeks, began to ap-
prove treatments for this virus we 
didn’t know a lot about. 
I want to say, in my 37 years—this 
December, I would have graduated 
from medical school 50 years ago—I 
don’t ever remember a time in my life 
where we found a disease, an infectious 
disease, where within 8 months we had 
cut the mortality rate by over 40 per-
cent. That is literally unheard of. 
It is a huge shout-out to the men and 
women who get up every day and go 
into our hospitals—we all know them 
at home—and put their lives on the 
line to treat us as patients and to take 
care of us. When given the proper 
equipment, they are doing a phe-
nomenal job on the front lines. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friends and colleagues who are still in 
practice every day for that. 
We had an opportunity in May. Once 
we had realized that this had ramped 
up and a lot of Americans had been af-
fected by this, the White House started 
something 
called 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed. 
Literally, in the history of this coun-
try, I don’t remember a time—typi-
cally, when we have a vaccine, a treat-
ment for a disease, there is usually 
anywhere from 3 or 4 years to 10 or 15 
years to get that vaccine approved and 
get it to market. 
What we want is a safe, effective vac-
cine like you would for polio. 
As a child, I remember as a little boy 
when the polio vaccine came out. Lit-
erally overnight in this country, we 
eliminated polio as a risk. Many of my 
friends developed polio. They got it be-
fore the vaccine was available. I was 
very fortunate and did not, as were 
many children. We have essentially 
eliminated that from the Earth today. 
We began Operation Warp Speed, 
which was to develop a vaccine. Well, 
how is that going to happen? We kept 
hearing it would be done in about a 
year. How can you safely do that in a 
year? 
What usually happens in vaccine de-
velopment is you sequence the RNA. 
The virus, you sequence it. After that 
virus is sequenced, you send your infor-
mation over to the FDA, and they ap-
prove that you can begin clinical phase 
1 trials. Phase 1 trials are typically 45 
or 50 patients. 
You then get the information from 
the phase 1 trials back to the FDA, the 
approval boards, and they give you per-
mission to go to phase 2 and then to 
phase 3 trials. 
If all of that is successful, then you 
begin to manufacture the vaccine and 
then deliver the vaccine to health de-
partments, to doctors’ offices, to hos-
pitals and pharmacies and so forth to 
use the vaccine, just like we do for the 
flu. 
What has happened this time is that 
all of these things have occurred simul-
taneously. So the phase 1 trials, the 
FDA gets the information. Phase 2 
trials, they get the information. If it 
looks good, they can go ahead with 
phase 3 trials. That is why right now 
we have three trials in phase 3 trials in 
8 months, which is unheard of, I can 
tell you. These are tens of thousands of 
patients who are enrolled in these 
trials. 
Hopefully, by the end of this year, we 
will have a vaccine that is both safe 
and effective to treat our people in this 
country, our ones at most risk. 
I am going to stop now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). The first 
person I would like to recognize to-
night is my good friend, Dr. MIKE BUR-
GESS, a fellow OB/GYN doctor rep-
resenting Texas’ District 26. 
He is a senior member of our GOP 
Doctors Caucus and has been active in 
the caucus since it began. Dr. BURGESS 
serves on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee as a senior member. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, Dr. ROE, for yielding 
and for convening this hour. 
I think it is so important that the 
people hear directly from us, the doc-
tors who are serving in the United 
States House of Representatives. 
When Dr. ROE was delivering his re-
marks, I was reminded of how the in-
formation about this illness came to us

September 14, 2020 
and how serious it seemed that a city 
in China, a city of 10 million people, 
would be shut down. 
Clearly, this was a significant illness 
and must be taken quite seriously, but 
I will say the committee on which I 
serve, the Subcommittee on Health for 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, the very committee that the 
Congress before had worked on the re-
authorization of the Pandemic All-Haz-
ards Preparedness Act, would not hold 
a hearing on this during the month of 
February. It was a missed opportunity. 
We had created the legislation that 
reauthorized pandemic preparedness. 
The President had signed that into law 
in June 2019. Now, 6 months later, we 
are faced with this possible worldwide 
pandemic. 
You would think there would have 
been enough curiosity on the com-
mittee to do some real-time oversight. 
Did we get it right? Were we focused on 
the right conditions? Were we respond-
ing to the right signals? 
But we don’t know because we didn’t 
look. We had to do hearings on flavored 
tobacco, horse racing, ticket stubs, all 
kinds of other things. 
It was not until the end of February, 
tacked on to the waning moments of a 
budget hearing, that we heard from the 
Secretary of Health in the principle 
subcommittee that deals with health in 
this United States House of Represent-
atives. 
Dr. ROE also has talked about the 
speed with which the development of 
the vaccine is progressing, and it is 
truly remarkable. 
Just as a data point, for people who 
may not remember, when Ebola was ca-
reening through western Africa, in Au-
gust 2014, we basically had a vaccine 
that was at the same place as our can-
didate vaccines were at the end of Au-
gust 2014, the end of phase 1 trials. The 
final approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration came in December 2019. 
Clearly, that 5-year time horizon is 
just too long in this situation, and the 
administration recognized that. The 
President recognized that and leaned 
into the process of developing a vac-
cine. 
One of the more remarkable things I 
have seen is that the Food and Drug 
Administration is going to license the 
production of appropriate vaccine can-
didates prior to their approval. 
Now, they can’t be sold until they get 
that final approval, so there is a finan-
cial risk that is taken by the compa-
nies that proceed with the production 
of that vaccine. 
But for those who remember the fall 
of 2019, when H1N1 was such a problem 
in this country, remember the vaccine 
was developed and then another month 
went by before there was sufficient 
quantity of the vaccine to begin vacci-
nating 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
popu-
lations. That is not going to happen 
under the watch of Donald J. Trump. 
I, for one, am grateful for the leader-
ship that the President has provided in 
this regard. I am grateful for the lead-
ership that the House Doctors Caucus 
has been providing as we go through 
this very difficult time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from 
Tennessee for yielding. 
b 2030 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, Dr. BURGESS is correct. It is 
one thing to manufacture a very small 
amount of vaccine, and vaccines are 
only one part of the prevention part. 
We all know about washing our hands 
and face coverings, and the American 
people are doing that. Certainly, I have 
traveled a lot, as we all have, and I 
have seen great compliance in my 
home State of Tennessee with this very 
deadly virus. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON), my good 
friend, and he is that indeed. I have had 
the privilege of getting to know Dr. 
BUCSHON and his family. I have been to 
his district, Indiana 8 in Evansville. 
He has been here five terms, has 
served a little over 10 years as U.S. 
Navy 
Reserve, 
and 
is 
a 
retired 
cardiothoracic surgeon. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honor to be here on the floor of the 
U.S. House of Representatives tonight 
with my fellow Doc Caucus members. I 
want to thank Dr. ROE for putting this 
Special Order together. It is really im-
portant that the American people hear 
from the medical professionals in the 
Congress about this really critical 
issue. 
I remember back in medical school, 
one of my first rotations, I was on pedi-
atrics. I understood vaccines to a cer-
tain extent, but then one of my first 
patients I had had whooping cough be-
cause they hadn’t been vaccinated. So 
that is when I started to understand 
what it actually means to have safe 
and effective vaccines, not only for 
children but also for other diseases. 
In this situation, what we need to do, 
as the American people, is we need to 
work to restore our way of life in 
America and around the world. 
And how are we going to do that as it 
relates to COVID–19? Well, we are 
going to have to have a safe and effec-
tive vaccine. 
And what I have been impressed with 
really over the last few months, up to 
about 6 months, is the unprecedented 
response from this administration as it 
relates to developing a vaccine so that 
we can restore our way of life in Amer-
ica and around the world. 
And what have they done? Working 
along with Congress, of course there 
has been financing to help finance re-
search and development of the vaccine, 
but also other things. 
Operation Warp Speed has really put 
in an unprecedented streamlining of 
the process. Let me just say this: not 
eliminating the process of developing a 
vaccine, which would potentially make 
it problematic with safety and efficacy 
and whether it works or not, but 
streamlining the process, doing things 
together with private-sector compa-
nies, helping design the research proto-
cols after they have helped pick the 
best candidates for an effective vac-
cine. 
So, the Federal Government working 
in concert with the private sector help-
ing to pick the best candidates, not 
just people throwing out, ‘‘Hey, I have 
got a great candidate here,’’ but look-
ing at the science of these develop-
ments, this research, helping to pick 
the best candidates and then stream-
lining the process by helping to design 
the further protocols, as Dr. ROE has 
mentioned, the phase one, two, and 
three trials and working in concert. So 
the Federal Government doesn’t just 
sit back and say, like would normally 
happen: ‘‘Well, do your research. Go 
through the process. Show us that this 
works.’’ 
See, the government, under this ad-
ministration, is working in concert at 
the same time, so that once we have 
this vaccine get to the point where it 
has been developed, people at FDA al-
ready know what has been happening 
with this vaccine. It is unprecedented, 
really. 
I think Dr. BURGESS just mentioned 
the manufacturing process, already 
manufacturing 
the 
vaccines 
before 
they develop, so as soon as it gets prov-
en to be safe, number one, effective, 
number two, look, we are going to have 
vaccines available. Again, that would 
not happen without Operation Warp 
Speed. 
Let me just say this in closing, and 
then I will turn it back to Dr. ROE. 
These are career scientists at FDA, 
NIH, Health and Human 
Services. 
These are people who have worked— 
many, for decades—on vaccine develop-
ment. 
The narrative that politicians are 
driving this is just not true. The re-
ality is—and I think Dr. Collins, 
Francis Collins from the NIH, testified 
in front of Congress last week or the 
week before—that science is driving 
this. We want safe and effective vac-
cines. 
Let me just say this. When there is a 
vaccine 
available 
and 
when 
the 
healthcare providers, other people who 
are at high risk and everyone has had 
their chance to be vaccinated, I will 
take this vaccine myself because I have 
confidence that the process we are 
going through will ensure safety and it 
will ensure efficacy. The vaccine will 
work. 
Let’s help restore our way of life. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I think you have to ask, any 
time you put something like this, Op-
eration Warp Speed, together is: What 
is the goal? And the goal of that is to 
produce 300 million doses of an effec-
tive, safe vaccine to protect the Amer-
ican people. And also, it is to provide 
therapeutics 
and 
diagnostics 
along 
with that. 
And this is under the umbrella of 
Health and Human Services; the FDA; 
the CDC; the NIH; BARDA, which is 
the Biomedical Advanced Research and

Developmental Authority; and the De-
partment of Defense. So it is a multi-
department approach of the entire gov-
ernment and the private sector. It is a 
private-public partnership to try to 
help defeat this virus and put our 
American people back at ease and back 
at work. 
Look, every day when I go home, 
they say: Dr. ROE, when are we going 
to be able to get back to normal? 
And yesterday was the first day I had 
attended an in-person church service in 
6 months, the longest time in my life I 
remember not being in church, and 
people were so glad to be there and to 
have some semblance of normalcy. 
This morning I got up. As I drove 
back, I saw parents putting their chil-
dren 
on 
schoolbuses—something 
as 
simple as that, just to put your child 
on a schoolbus. I saw a mother this 
morning hug her little boy, and he 
jumps on with his mask on, jumps on 
the schoolbus ready to go to school. I 
think people are craving that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP), my good 
friend, who is the vice chair of the Doc-
tors Caucus, as Dr. BUCSHON is. He is a 
colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve—I 
have to salute him. I never made it 
past O–4—for over 20 years. He served 
in Iraq and also served on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and chaired 
the Subcommittee on Health. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, this is 
such a unique experience for all of us 
tonight. Here we are on the floor of 
Congress, and we have got almost a 
dozen healthcare providers coming to 
share our years of experience and 
knowledge and education with the 
American people as far as what we are 
trying to do in this country to develop 
a vaccine for the coronavirus. I mean, 
vaccines save lives. That is nothing 
new. Vaccines prevent illness. We know 
this. 
I know growing up, my mom’s first 
cousin had gotten polio when she was 4 
years old. She spent the rest of her life 
in a wheelchair, disfigured, disfigured 
hands. She still found a way to make a 
living. But think if she had just had 
that vaccine a little bit sooner, if we 
had actually come up with it. 
And to this day, the challenges that 
we 
face—I 
look 
at 
Rotary 
Inter-
national, of which I am a member, and 
their goal is to rid the world of polio 
and try to get everyone in the world 
vaccinated. 
This is not new science. But I will 
tell you this: With the virus that we 
are facing today, it is called novel for 
a reason. It is new and it is different, 
and we know more today than we knew 
6 months ago. That is what is so impor-
tant is that we continue to learn and 
get better and take care of people. 
We know that some people are more 
at risk than others. We know that 
some people are more vulnerable to 
this than others. When we look at the 
symptoms for those who have tested 
positive and have gotten this, the 
symptoms can go anywhere from no 
symptoms at all to may be a cough or 
a cold or flu-like symptoms or loss of 
taste and smell to respiratory prob-
lems, difficulty breathing, all the way, 
as we know, to death. 
But therapeutics have come into play 
as we are studying this and under-
standing and identifying this virus and 
being able to treat it. 
Early on, we were taking a concept 
that is not new, which is to take what 
we call convalescent plasma, take plas-
ma from somebody who has had this 
disease and gotten better, developed 
the antibodies, so that they can use it 
to help someone else. And we have seen 
that it has been effective. We have seen 
that it has helped. 
We have seen antivirals like the 
Remdesivir come forward that are 
working and helping people get better. 
Not everyone gets better, so the fight 
always continues. 
We are using steroid treatments to 
reduce some of the inflammation that 
occurs from this viral attack, espe-
cially on the lungs, because it is the 
damage to the lungs that does the 
most. 
So think about this and what we are 
doing today. If someone tests positive, 
especially if they have no or very few 
symptoms, go home and quarantine; 
check 
your 
temperature. 
You 
can 
check your oxygen level in your blood 
which, if it is going down, then you are 
getting sicker. It is a pulse oximeter. 
You put it on your finger. You can get 
them on Amazon. And if you are get-
ting sicker, then the time to be treated 
is sooner rather than later. And that is 
what we are doing. 
So, as has been mentioned a couple of 
times tonight, the mortality rate has 
gone down 40 percent, which is almost 
unheard of, and that is without a vac-
cine. That is with the therapeutics 
that have been developed. 
We are doing something that prob-
ably no other country is doing to the 
level that we are doing. We are testing 
healthy people, people with no symp-
toms. Why? Because we know that peo-
ple without symptoms can spread this, 
and it is important that we know who 
they are. No other country is doing the 
amount of testing that we do. 
I was out with the National Guard 
during the August break. I went to four 
sites. We did about 1,000 tests on people 
driving up or walking up. It is amazing 
what we are doing with our country 
and how we are trying to respond to 
this. 
So, on to Operation Warp Speed. This 
is about a commonsense path forward 
to find a safe and effective vaccine, and 
we are doing it in a way that no one 
has ever seen before. 
Right now, in record time, you have 
seen pharmaceutical companies that 
usually compete against each other 
coming together to share knowledge 
and to come forward to try and develop 
a vaccine. We have six that are in 
phase three right now, three that are 
up and running. 
I want to point out one thing about 
this 
being 
safe 
and 
effective. 
AstraZeneca had one patient in a trial 
who developed an illness; and just like 
any other trial, when something like 
that happens, you put it on pause. You 
put it on pause to make sure that that 
illness was not a result of the trial or 
the vaccine. That is how you develop a 
safe and effective vaccine. 
We are asking for about 30,000 volun-
teers for every one of these trials. That 
is the standard. Some will do even 
more. It is really incredible what we 
have done in such a short amount of 
time, and I applaud the people who are 
stepping up to be in these trials so that 
we can develop a vaccine right here in 
America. 
The public-private collaboration is 
unique. It is new, and, as has been men-
tioned, the risk we take is that we are 
developing the vaccines and manufac-
turing before they have been through 
phase three, and if they don’t get 
through phase three, then it is wasted. 
But if they do, then immediately we 
have it and we start treating the most 
vulnerable people. Ultimately, we want 
300 million vaccines to treat all of 
America. 
There are a lot of lessons learned. We 
have learned a lot. There is still more 
to learn. Only science will solve this, 
folks. That is who is going to solve it. 
I just want to say this. When I look 
at Operation Warp Speed and all that 
we have done in this country so far, if 
there is going to be a pandemic in this 
world, there is no other country that I 
would rather be in than the United 
States of America. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, before the gentleman leaves, I 
know we had the opportunity, and we 
do about weekly, to be on a phone con-
ference call with Operation Warp Speed 
leaders. One of the things that they 
asked us to do, and I do this here to-
night, is to ask more African Ameri-
cans to sign up for the vaccine trials. 
b 2045 
In one particular large trial there 
were only 5.5 percent I believe African 
Americans in the trial, and they need 
to get that up. 
So if you are out there, I am asking 
you to volunteer for this trial. Cer-
tainly, we need that. I think they had 
enough Latinos and senior citizens like 
myself, but I think that we do need 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, you do need that. Basi-
cally, you need to study this as you do 
the population. 
I think Pfizer is going to increase 
their trial to the low 40,000s. So it is a 
huge—just to let people know—that is 
a gigantic clinical trial. It is placebo 
controlled. One group gets a saline, ba-
sically a placebo, and the other group 
gets the vaccines. Then you check 
later. 
By the way, all of these six vaccines, 
five of them will be two shots; one, and 
then one 21 to 28 days later. One which

will be developed a little later on, I 
think into 2021, will be a single shot. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. To add to that, this 
is important, they are trying to make 
sure that the people in the trials are 
coming from the groups that are most 
vulnerable especially, and they want to 
make sure that that is an adequate 
number so that we get, again, a safe 
and effective vaccine. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
How you decide who gets this vaccine 
is basically you just look at who suf-
fered the most from it. 
Where has that been? 
It has been your nursing homes and 
your long-term care facilities. 
I want to give the VA a shout-out. I 
served as the ranking member on the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee and chair-
man in the last Congress. 
They have used the fourth mission of 
the VA to go out into many, many 
nursing homes across this country and 
to train and bring people up to speed 
about how to isolate patients so that it 
doesn’t spread. 
I remember one State veterans’ nurs-
ing home in Massachusetts that lost 
over 70 veterans—that is unbelievable— 
in one facility. So we are getting much 
better. It is our elderly and long-term 
care facilities, over 40 percent of the 
deaths have been in long-term care and 
nursing homes. 
Certainly, our healthcare workers 
and our first responders should be the 
first ones when a safe and effective vac-
cine is created. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS). Dr. HAR-
RIS is the cochair of the Doctors Cau-
cus. Dr. ANDY HARRIS is a Navy veteran 
and very active Member who will have 
the reins next year. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Dr. ROE for his service. Congress will 
miss him next year. We will miss his 
expertise especially in this time of cri-
sis in the Nation. 
But I am going to make my remarks 
very brief to remind the American peo-
ple who are watching what we were 
talking about back in spring about the 
possibilities of how this pandemic 
comes to an end. The possibilities real-
ly were, well, the virus weakens on its 
own, but we haven’t seen that at all, or 
a vaccine is developed. 
I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, because 
I have had NIH grants, an NIH grant is 
usually written for a 3-year period with 
a renewal because that is usually how 
long it takes to even begin to make a 
discovery. With vaccines it is typically 
5 to 10 years. 
What we are talking about now, be-
cause of what this administration has 
done, is to have a vaccine being admin-
istered, being declared safe by the FDA 
potentially within 10 months of concep-
tualizing a vaccine. 
As Dr. ROE knows, I sit on the Health 
Subcommittee of the Appropriations 
Committee, and foundations for Oper-
ation Warp Speed were laid by this ad-
ministration years ago when they in-
creased funding to the Biomedical Ad-
vanced Research and Development Au-
thority which we call BARDA. One of 
the things they did is decide to heavily 
invest in vaccine technology and vac-
cine production, because it is one thing 
to discover the vaccine and to prove it 
is safe, it is another thing to make 
hundreds of millions of doses. Think 
about it, Mr. Speaker, you actually 
have to make the glass vials and you 
have to have the facility that can 
produce that. That is exactly what this 
administration 
has 
done 
through 
BARDA over the last few years, have 
those facilities in the United States. 
This isn’t like some of the PPE that 
we have to outsource overseas. We have 
the ability in this country to create 
hundreds of millions of vaccines, and 
we likely will by next year. Again, this 
is very, very unusual. 
Mr. Speaker, as you will hear from a 
lot of the doctors tonight, it is very un-
usual to be able to do this within 
months, to be able to tell the American 
people that there is light at the end of 
the tunnel and that we see the end of 
this pandemic because, again, as the 
American people know, your own local 
school board may have said: We really 
can’t go back to school full-time until 
there is a vaccine. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, we are going to 
have that vaccine because this admin-
istration has cut through the red tape 
with Operation Warp Speed, ensuring a 
safe and effective vaccine that can be 
produced for hundreds of millions of 
people. That is really phenomenal. Be-
cause once we take care of the United 
States, then we can actually take care 
of the world health and this pandemic. 
That will be truly a wonderful thing. 
I want to thank Dr. ROE for leading 
this tonight and for giving me the op-
portunity to remind the American peo-
ple that from the very beginning we 
said the vaccine was the solution, and 
this administration is delivering that 
solution. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say to Dr. 
HARRIS before he leaves, let’s have a 
little discussion. The Doctors Caucus 
can get down in the weeds sometimes, 
and I realize that we do. But let’s ex-
plain to people what herd immunity is. 
What does it actually mean? You 
heard about this, and you hear all 
these folks get on TV and the talking 
heads start talking about it. 
What does that actually mean? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, if you 
think about it, the herd is h-e-r-d, just 
like a herd of critters. In this case we 
talk about humans. 
If you think about it, Mr. Speaker, 
your chance of contracting, in this 
case, a respiratory virus is propor-
tional to the number of people you 
come in contact with who could spread 
it to you. 
Conventional wisdom is that if 60 or 
70 percent of the people have had the 
virus or are immune to the virus, ei-
ther naturally by having the virus or 
by having a vaccine, then your chance 
of contracting it goes way down be-
cause your chance of coming in contact 
with someone who has that virus or is 
not immune to it has gone way down. 
You achieve functionally what is called 
herd immunity; that is, your chance of 
developing that virus is much, much 
lower. So it means that you can begin 
to do some of the things, to draw back 
on some of those restrictions that we 
have now that people are so upset with. 
That is what a vaccine promises to 
deliver because certainly a percent of 
the population now has immunity by 
having had the virus, but a much larg-
er percent will have immunity because 
they are vaccinated and therefore can’t 
get it nor can spread it to someone 
else. It is a very important public 
health concept. 
It looks like if these vaccines are ap-
proved by year end or early next year, 
by next summer—I tell this to people 
in my district—we could actually have 
a normal summer. 
Wouldn’t that be nice? 
We could actually have a normal 
summer. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Ac-
tually, we had a normal summer at the 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park 
this year. We had 1.7 million people 
come in July which was a record, I un-
derstand. 
One of the things I want to also men-
tion briefly while Dr. DUNN comes up 
is: Should you wear a mask, or should 
you not wear a mask? 
A mask is an inconvenience. I am 
standing here way away from anybody, 
20 feet away from anybody, but the way 
a mask probably works is this—these 
are not good enough to keep a virus 
from getting in. But if you walk 
through a room with coronavirus and 
you walk through a room filled with 
people, Mr. Speaker, you potentially 
will infect 21⁄2 of those people. 
Why? 
Because it is probably spread by 
droplets. So if I have this mask on it 
prevents—if I sneeze or cough or what-
ever—a droplet from getting out or cer-
tainly not spreading very far. That is 
why if you touch a surface you want to 
wash your hands and cleanse the sur-
face. 
To give an example of how infectious 
measles is, if I have the measles and I 
walk through that same room, I prob-
ably can infect as many as 15 to 18 peo-
ple. So it is aerosolized. It is like a pol-
len in the air. That is how it is spread 
as opposed to just a droplet spread, 
which means that the coronavirus is 
not spread nearly as easily as some 
other viruses are. 
I wore a mask for over 30 years in the 
operating room. If it turns out it 
doesn’t help all that much, then you 
have been inconvenienced. If it helps, 
then you maybe have saved a life. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure 
to introduce Dr. DUNN. My friend is a 
U.S. Army veteran. I served with Dr. 
DUNN on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. He is extremely active on that

committee. It has been a real pleasure 
to serve with Dr. DUNN in the U.S. Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DUNN). 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman ROE for putting on this op-
portunity for us to address the Amer-
ican people directly and reassure them 
that this Operation Warp Speed is 
truly an amazing accomplishment for 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, if you were born after 
1969 you didn’t get a chance to cele-
brate with us on the original moon-
shot, those heady days of the Apollo 
landing and all the run-up science to 
get that done. 
This is America’s new moonshot. 
This 
is 
an 
amazing 
program. 
By 
leveraging the private sector and all 
parts of the private sector, as well as 
all of the agencies and all of govern-
ment effort, we are making progress on 
medical science at a rate that has lit-
erally never been seen before. Every 
living Nobel Prize laureate with a 
Nobel Prize in medicine is cooperating 
with the government and rushing for-
ward. The science on all these areas is 
really making a difference and making 
a difference very quickly. 
The administration put $10 billion 
with a B—bravo—in supplemental fund-
ing into the Operation Warp Speed and 
separately another $1.5 billion into de-
veloping Shark Tank testing. So we are 
not only working on vaccines, we are 
working on testing for the virus, we 
are working on prevention of the virus, 
and we are working on therapeutics, 
that 
is 
medicines 
that 
are 
true 
antivirals. 
We already have new protocols so 
that we are improving the treatment. 
The mortality rate for this disease has 
plummeted. 
I mentioned that innovative and cre-
ative people are coming out and work-
ing on all facets of this disease. I have 
a story. This is a mask. Every one of 
you has a mask. This is a different 
kind of a mask. This is made out of a 
polyester fiber, and it is impregnated 
with bionic silver. It is virucidal. It 
kills the virus. It kills bacteria as well. 
So when you take your mask off, Mr. 
Speaker, and you put it down on the 
table, it sets about sterilizing itself. 
When I pick it back up, it will be ster-
ile. That is an amazing accomplish-
ment. That happened just this year, 
just since this started. 
It is amazing these things can hap-
pen. All the science and all the medical 
experimenters and all the researchers 
are running flat out. We are pushing 
new frontiers in medicine. We are 
doing things that we never thought we 
would do in my lifetime in medicine. 
We have broken the mold, and I am so 
grateful to all the brilliant innovative 
men and women who are pushing out 
these frontiers and helping everybody. 
Medicine will never be the same after 
this just because of the advances in 
this time to this threat. We will be 
treating all of our diseases differently 
in the future. 
Before I close I would like to asso-
ciate myself with the comments Chair-
man ROE made earlier about the her-
oism of the medical care people and the 
healthcare people at all levels, includ-
ing the ambulance drivers and the po-
lice who have to go out and respond to 
people. It is heroic for them to go out 
there and do that and continue to work 
in very difficult and challenging cir-
cumstances. But I think what this 
amounts to is America’s shining mo-
ment in medicine. I can’t think of a 
better time I have ever seen American 
medicine respond. 
It has been a pleasure working with 
Chairman ROE. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. It 
has been. One of the things that the 
CARES package did was—this is not 
Operation Warp Speed—but the CARES 
package also provided the way we shift 
when seeing patients in person through 
telehealth. 
The VA, for instance, about 1 year 
ago did 70,000 or 80,000 telehealth visits 
a month for their PTSD treatments. 
That number went to over 900,000 in 
May of this year. That is unbelievable 
when you can do that. I think many 
practices now, including my own at 
home, have used telehealth to see pa-
tients, and I myself have used tele-
health which saved me a many-hour 
drive one way or the other. 
The pandemic is not all bad. We have 
learned some good things and some 
things I think that are going to persist 
after we get through this particular 
pandemic. 
I also might add, this is not the first 
pandemic we have had. That is why I 
know we were going to be fine. There 
was an H3N2 pandemic in 1968, a 
coronavirus pandemic, and we got 
through that as a country. We have re-
sponded so much better this time with 
the 
therapeutics, 
monoclonal 
anti-
bodies antivirals, just the way we treat 
it. 
Anticoagulation hasn’t been men-
tioned. We know this is an inflam-
matory response. It causes coagulation 
in the kidneys, the heart, and the 
lungs. So we have learned that. 
Hats off to our medical professionals 
who have gone out and literally—it is 
unbelievable how fast they have upped 
their knowledge of this. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s com-
ments. 
b 2100 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), who I 
just introduced. He is double-boarded 
in internal medicine and dermatology, 
is a relatively new representative from 
Pennsylvania 13th, and has had 31 
years in practice. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend, the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, for yielding 
and for his leadership in the Doctor’s 
Caucus. 
Dr. ROE has educated us that perhaps 
as physicians in the United States Con-
gress there might not be a more impor-
tant time that we present ourselves, 
our abilities to communicate, and un-
derstand the nature of this novel 
coronavirus and its impact on the 
world, and specifically, on Pennsyl-
vania. 
Over the past 6 months, the Amer-
ican people have united against what 
we have come to realize is an invisible 
enemy. We have done our part to slow 
the spread of the coronavirus and to 
serve our neighbors. Each and every 
one of us have made sacrifices during 
this pandemic. And together, we work 
to make a difference; we work to save 
lives. 
As we look ahead to the future, 
Americans are eagerly awaiting the ar-
rival of the coronavirus vaccine, and I 
am confident that our researchers, our 
scientists, are equipped to win this 
race. 
Right now, constituents in Pennsyl-
vania and around our country are mak-
ing incredible progress in this pursuit 
as part of Operation Warp Speed—the 
Trump administration’s historic initia-
tive to develop a coronavirus vaccine. 
Under the leadership of President 
Trump, the Department of Defense and 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services, together with so many in the 
private sector, are in the midst of what 
is truly an unprecedented search for a 
safe and effective vaccine, all in record 
time, with significant amounts of vac-
cine that will be developed for the peo-
ple of America. 
This process, as the doctors with me 
here tonight have testified, is driven by 
science but it is rooted in safety. And 
let’s be certain: A vaccine will only be 
approved if it is proven to be both safe 
and effective. 
Operation Warp Speed is taking all of 
the precautionary steps that are re-
quired to develop any vaccine. But here 
is the difference: As part of Operation 
Warp Speed, vaccine manufacturers 
can undertake several steps of vaccine 
development at the same time, miti-
gating the financial risk without, 
again, compromising the safety or the 
efficacy of the vaccine. 
We know that Operation Warp Speed 
is unprecedented. To achieve the re-
sults for the American people, the Fed-
eral Government has invested over $10 
billion to support the development of 
this coronavirus vaccine. While we, as 
Members, as healthcare professionals, 
recognize that there are no guarantees 
in science, this strategy is setting up 
manufacturers for success, and it is of-
fering hope for the American people. 
If anyone can deliver substantial 
qualities and quantities of a safe and 
effective vaccine within a year of the 
discovery of a new virus, it is the 
United States of America. 
Thanks to Americans’ unparalleled 
ingenuity and drive, we are better posi-
tioned to develop therapeutics and a 
vaccine than any other country. And 
Americans know that we are up to the 
challenge because we have seen chal-
lenges before. 
In the late 1940s, the polio virus was 
responsible for disabling more than

35,000 average people per year in the 
United States. And in 1954, Dr. Jonas 
Salk developed the polio vaccine at the 
University of Pittsburgh in my home 
State of Pennsylvania. Since then, the 
polio vaccine has been widely distrib-
uted in the United States and across 
the world. We have witnessed pre-
viously significant progress. And it is 
our hope—and that is why we bind to-
gether as the Doctor’s Caucus and 
present in this Special Order a discus-
sion of how this vaccine is being devel-
oped today, right now. And we look for-
ward to that. 
We trust in American ingenuity. We 
recognize that American ingenuity will 
win, and we are confident that we will 
see that in short order. 
Again, I thank my colleague, my 
mentor, Dr. PHIL ROE for organizing 
this Special Order and allowing us to 
present this important information to 
America. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, next I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). Dr. 
BUDDY
CARTER
is 
our 
only 
phar-
macist—soon to be two—in the U.S. 
Congress. We are glad to have Dr. Car-
ter from Georgia One. He has been an 
incredibly important member of the 
Doctor’s Caucus in providing his per-
spective because he has run a business 
for many, many years, has seen pa-
tients for many, many years, and 
brings his perspective to our caucus. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
and for his leadership. 
We are going to miss him. I know Dr. 
ROE is retiring, and there is going to be 
a great void there with him not being 
here, but I thank him for his service to 
the Doctor’s Caucus and his service to 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk 
about the amazing work our Nation’s 
top scientists are doing to get a safe 
and effective coronavirus vaccine to 
the American people. 
Earlier this year, President Trump 
initiated Operation Warp Speed, a col-
laborative effort between the Federal 
Government and the private sector to 
research, develop, and distribute a 
coronavirus vaccine. 
The merits of this initiative were 
quickly realized, and Congress came 
together in a bipartisan fashion and in-
vested $10 billion to support the effort. 
The focus of the initiative works by ac-
celerating 
development 
of 
vaccines 
through staggered clinical trials, com-
pletely overseen by Federal regulatory 
authorities. You have heard that time 
and time again tonight as each of the 
physicians here have explained how 
this is taking place. 
Traditionally, a vaccine would under-
go several separate phases of trials, 
with the average trial lasting nearly 7 
years. Mr. Speaker, we don’t have 7 
years. Our country—our world—needs a 
vaccine now, and that is why Operation 
Warp Speed is on track to deliver vac-
cines in record speed, potentially even 
by the end of the year. This is nothing 
short of a miracle. It is phenomenal. 
And it is critically important to 
stress that any vaccine approved by 
the FDA will be safe and effective. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been a practicing 
pharmacist for over 30 years. I have 
witnessed the process by which the 
FDA approves medications. They will 
not approve it unless it is safe and ef-
fective. Don’t think for one minute 
that any administration or any person 
is going to have an impact on that. 
They are not. It will be safe and effec-
tive if it is approved by the FDA. 
I repeat: Only vaccines that are prov-
en to be completely safe and effective 
will be allowed for use. 
But recently, we have heard dan-
gerous rhetoric from certain politi-
cians and candidates about Operation 
Warp Speed, rhetoric and comments 
that are lies based in politics instead of 
science; even doubting the thousands of 
scientists who have spent their life 
working to find cures and casting fear 
on the American people. 
I have outright confidence in this ad-
ministration’s commitment to safety 
and science. And I can tell my con-
stituents and the American people 
right now, I will be in line to get the 
vaccine when approved. 
Our communities are suffering, and 
we are losing loved ones. This effort 
will save thousands, if not hundreds of 
thousands, of lives. 
I commend this administration and 
the thousands of scientists working to 
find a cure, and I thank them for all 
they are doing to save lives, to produce 
a safe and effective vaccine. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, this should be about people 
not politics. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), my good 
friend, who is a dentist, who served 
both in the Army as an artilleryman 
and in the United States Air Force as a 
dentist, and has been a very active 
member of our caucus. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I can’t 
thank Dr. ROE enough for this initia-
tive and his leadership. And so many 
people have gotten up at the mike and 
said he was their mentor. He actually 
was my mentor, and I really appreciate 
him very much. 
Mr. Speaker, as a healthcare profes-
sional for nearly 40 years and a mem-
ber of the House Doctor’s Caucus, I am 
very pleased to report on the Trump 
administration’s groundbreaking, un-
precedented initiative to develop a safe 
and effective vaccine and treatment for 
COVID–19, 
called 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed. 
I remember well as a boy back in the 
1950s, and several of my schoolmates 
were stricken with polio. And I remem-
ber well standing in line at our elemen-
tary school to take the new vaccine, 
which virtually has eliminated polio in 
the United States of America. 
Well, our Nation’s best scientists and 
researchers, doctors, and manufactur-
ers are now collaborating and working 
around the clock to research, test, ap-
prove, and manufacture a vaccine in 
record time. This is the very key to re-
storing our way of life and rebuilding 
our economy to get back to those nor-
mal summers that we were talking 
about a while ago. 
The President has capitalized on the 
ingenuity and the drive of the private 
sector and the scientific community, 
putting the United States at a better 
position than any other country in the 
world to develop a vaccine that the en-
tire world can then benefit from. 
The goal of Operation Warp Speed is 
to deliver 300 million doses of a safe 
and effective vaccine by January 2021. 
And by removing all unnecessary red 
tape and barriers, the President is on 
track to meet this goal. 
The administration is cutting the de-
velopment time to a matter of months 
by allowing development steps to occur 
simultaneously. 
Despite 
what 
the 
media may incorrectly report, the test-
ing standards for this are the same as 
any other vaccine developed here in the 
United States of America. No safety 
shortcuts are being taken. The health 
and safety of the public remains the 
number one priority of this administra-
tion, and we have every reason to be 
hopeful. 
The advances that the scientific com-
munity has made since the beginning 
of this pandemic are nothing short of 
remarkable and are directly respon-
sible for a 40 percent decrease in the 
mortality rate from COVID–19 that we 
have seen. 
Our knowledge about this novel virus 
grows every single day. And with our 
Nation’s leaders and brightest minds 
working together, we will defeat this 
disease with unprecedented speed. 
As a practicing dentist for nearly 
four decades, I believe that prevention 
is the best treatment, and that is ex-
actly what this vaccine will do. While 
finding treatments and the thera-
peutics to fight this disease and its 
symptoms are a very worthwhile cause, 
actually blocking the virus from in-
fecting us in the first place is the very 
strongest defensive strategy that we 
can have. 
President Trump and his administra-
tion are bravely blazing a trail forward 
and leading our country out of this 
challenging time of global pandemic. 
So thanks to Operation Warp Speed, 
the world is only months away from a 
safe and reliable vaccine. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I might point out that I have 
never seen a Republican or Democratic 
virus in my life. Just like I have never 
seen a Republican or Democratic can-
cer. This just affects people. The virus 
will be safe, it will be effective, and it 
will be voluntary. It will be a person’s 
decision, or their family’s decision, 
who actually receives the vaccine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4379 
September 14, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY), 
who I served with on the Committee on 
Education and Labor, my good friend, 
and the newest member of the GOP’s 
Doctor’s Caucus. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. ROE for yielding, 
and thank him for gathering everyone 
together. 
Mr. Speaker, I will give a summary 
here this evening. Since the end of Jan-
uary, the world has been attacked es-
sentially by a virus that none of us can 
see. I will say that since May 15, our 
administration has put in play Oper-
ation Warp Speed, and this is meant to 
save American lives. 
Mr. Speaker, $10 billion was allocated 
by this body to develop a safe and ef-
fective vaccine in record time. It has 
literally 
been 
today’s 
Manhattan 
Project. It is combining the resources 
and the brilliant minds of private in-
dustry and governmental researchers 
in an unprecedented effort of coopera-
tion. We have used decades of previous 
research combined with today’s new 
technology and research to help us end 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The objective is to deliver 300 million 
doses by the end of December, early 
January, to the citizens of the United 
States. 
What do vaccines do? I think it is 
very important for people to under-
stand what vaccines do. 
They stimulate the immune system 
to produce antibodies exactly as it 
would happen if you were exposed to 
the disease. After you get vaccinated, 
you develop immunity to that disease 
without having to get the disease first. 
We have two trials, two companies— 
Moderna and Pfizer—that are furthest 
along in their developments; 20,000 in-
dividuals so far have been accrued in 
the trials—half have been getting the 
vaccines, half placebo, and we need 
more. 
The highest at-risk populations are 
those being targeted: The elderly, 
those with comorbidities, Black Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans. As we have 
heard earlier, Black Americans are 
under-enrolling in the vaccine and we 
need them to enroll. 
So how can this process, which nor-
mally takes years, be done in 8 
months? 
b 2115 
It is that research is being done con-
currently rather than in parallel; our 
phases are going at the same time; and 
production is going at the same time, 
fully understanding that we may have 
millions of doses of a vaccine that we 
will never use. 
How do we develop this at warp 
speed? Just to give folks one example, 
how do we develop a vaccine this 
quickly? 
If you can imagine the space shuttle, 
the space shuttle is a transport mecha-
nism. It carries things out to the space 
station. We already have the space 
shuttle. We use that in vaccines. But 
what we have now is a different pay-
load, a different payload going out to 
the space station. And the space shut-
tle is taking that into viruses with a 
different payload now specific to the 
coronavirus. 
What 
all 
Americans 
are 
talking 
about now is not only the development 
of a vaccine but a safe vaccine. We 
have proof that the processes that are 
in place to develop safe vaccines are 
working. 
As 
we 
have 
talked 
about, 
AstraZeneca stopped its trial because 
there was one untoward event. We have 
done research, and now they have 
started that trial again. Stopping 
trials is very commonplace in vaccine 
development, and the American people 
need to understand this. 
We went through this once before 
with polio. Polio in the fifties was kill-
ing thousands and disabling many, 
many more. Jonas Salk developed the 
vaccine. What he did was remarkable, 
but what he did also was led by exam-
ple. He took the vaccine himself, and 
he had his family take the vaccine. 
This is what the Doctors Caucus is 
going to do. I will take the vaccine. 
The other members of the Doctors Cau-
cus will take the vaccine because we 
need to tell the American people that 
we, physicians who have trained our 
entire lives in medicine, believe that 
what we are doing and what we are 
doing for the American people is safe. 
What this will come out to is that we 
will have 300 million doses. Right now, 
our government is working on how to 
get those doses out to the American 
people. In an unprecedented effort, the 
CDC is working with HHS and the De-
partment of Defense to develop a mech-
anism to get the vaccine out and to 
track the vaccine. 
Finally, I will say this to the Amer-
ican people. There are two ways out of 
this pandemic, two ways on the path-
way back to normalcy. One is to be-
come infected with the virus, develop 
antibodies, and you recover. The sec-
ond is to take the vaccine, develop 
antibodies without ever having the dis-
ease, and we can move forward as a Na-
tion. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleagues for 
being here tonight. I look forward to 
continuing this debate and this discus-
sion here on the House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remain-
der of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Mighty God, teach us to trust You 
more fully, to wait quietly for the un-
folding of Your providence, to pray fer-
vently, and to worship more humbly. 
Reassure us with Your wisdom, power, 
and love that Your providence will pre-
vail. 
Lord, You are our shelter for every 
storm. Remind our lawmakers to re-
member how Your purposes have pre-
vailed in our Nation’s history so they 
need not fear for the future. 
Lord, provide them with a firm faith 
that will enable them to meet the 
daunting challenges of these times. 
Lengthen their moments of prayer 
until their lives become a continual as-
piration after You. 
We pray in Your matchless Name. 
Amen.

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RUSSIA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
poisoning of Russian opposition leader 
Alexei Navalny, which happened last 
month, was a very disgusting thing to 
hear about. Such action in Russia or by 
Russia is not unprecedented. In 2015, 
the leading democracy advocate in 
Russia, Boris Nemtsov, was gunned 
down within the sight of the Kremlin. 
The square in front of the Russian Em-
bassy in Washington is now named in 
his honor, echoing the effort that I led 
to name the street in front of the old 
Russian Embassy after the dissident 
Andrei Sakharov. 
Nemtsov’s protege in the Russian op-
position, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was 
then poisoned—poisoned twice but mi-
raculously survived and continues to 
work for Russian democracy. The good 
news is that Mr. Navalny is reportedly 
conscious. 
Now, a silver lining may also be that 
Putin’s latest attempted assassination 
is bringing our allies toward a con-
sensus to treat Putin as a pariah. 
There are reports of senior German 
politicians reconsidering their support 
for Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which di-
vides our European allies. This pipeline 
is opposed by countries like Poland and 
the Baltics that truly understand that 
Putin will use it as a strategic influ-
ence tool, as well as by the Trump ad-
ministration and bipartisan majorities 
in Congress. 
I hope all of these happenings are a 
start of a new era of cooperation with 
our Russian allies to counter Russian 
influence. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
when I address the situation in the 
Middle East, it is often to discuss in-
stability, terror, or other threats to 
the United States and its partners, like 
Israel. Those threats still exist, but I 
am very glad to be speaking today 
about peace breaking out, and it is 
breaking out more quickly than we can 
even stage the official ceremonies to 
memorialize the diplomatic achieve-
ments. 
A few weeks ago, with major help 
from the United States and the Trump 
administration, Israel and the United 
Arab Emirates reached the first Arab- 
Israel peace deal in 26 years. The Abra-
ham Accord is named for the shared re-
ligious roots that Christians, Jews, and 
Muslims all hold in common. It will 
make the UAE just the third Arab na-
tion, and the very first in the gulf, to 
normalize relations with Israel. In the 
words of Prime Minister Netanyahu, 
‘‘full and official peace, full diplomatic 
agreement, 
with 
embassies, 
invest-
ment, commerce, tourism, and direct 
flights between Tel Aviv and Dubai and 
Abu Dhabi.’’ 
We have come a long way—a long 
way indeed. What a moment. 
Farsighted leaders in both countries 
made sacrifices to make this deal pos-
sible. Prime Minister Netanyahu and 
Sheikh Muhammad bin Zayid under-
stand that both Arabs and Israelis will 
benefit from the peace and prosperity 
that tearing down barriers can bring. 
America will also benefit from these 
two regional friends working more 
closely together and reducing tensions 
across the challenging region. 
Now, to be sure, work is not finished, 
and no single step like this should be 
confused for an overnight miracle. In 
this case, we in Congress have an obli-
gation to review any U.S. arms sales 
package linked to the deal. As we help 
our Arab partners defend against grow-
ing threats, we must continue ensuring 
that Israel’s qualitative military edge

remains unchallenged. But the winds of 
change are blowing, and they are bring-
ing good news for peace all across the 
region. 
Of course, a few extreme voices, per-
haps correctly sensing that their mo-
ment is slipping away, are not at all 
happy. A predictable cast of characters 
wasted no time condemning the agree-
ment and branding the UAE as traitors 
to the Arab or Muslim world. 
Unlike Iranian clerics or al-Qaida 
terrorists, everyone who is actually 
living in the 21st century is celebrating 
this major progress. This major step 
forward is being documented in a sign-
ing ceremony at the White House to-
morrow. But in just the couple of 
weeks that have elapsed between the 
announcement of the Abraham Accord 
and the official ceremony tomorrow, 
another Arab state has joined the pa-
rade toward peace. On Friday, Sep-
tember 11, Israel and Bahrain an-
nounced their agreement to open for-
mal diplomatic relations. After Egypt, 
Jordan, and the UAE, this makes the 
fourth historic step toward normaliza-
tion by Israel’s Arab neighbors. 
Along with President Trump, Prime 
Minister Netanyahu and King Hamad 
of Bahrain called the agreement ‘‘a his-
toric breakthrough to further peace in 
the Middle East.’’ Indeed, reports sug-
gest that still more Arab states may 
not be far behind. This is a new course 
with the potential to fundamentally— 
fundamentally—change 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Dennis Ross, former senior diplo-
matic adviser to President Obama and 
a longtime practitioner of the peace 
process, wrote just yesterday that 
these agreements are bona fide ‘‘break-
throughs’’ that are changing ‘‘the po-
litical landscape of the Middle East’’ 
and the Israel-Palestine stalemate for 
the better. That is Dennis Ross, from 
the Obama administration. That is how 
former Obama administration officials 
are praising the Trump administra-
tion’s successes. 
I am grateful for this administra-
tion’s work to encourage peace. I am 
proud of this historic opportunity that 
American leadership and diplomacy 
has made possible. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a totally different message, I 
had hoped, Republicans had hoped, and 
the American people had hoped that 
the Senate would be spending this 
week finishing up another bipartisan 
agreement on coronavirus relief. We 
want to get hundreds of billions more 
dollars into the pipeline for kids, for 
jobs, for healthcare. 
Unfortunately, 
Senate 
Democrats 
chose to block it all. Our Democratic 
colleagues voted against hundreds of 
billions of dollars to help Americans 
fight the virus. This wasn’t even a vote 
on final passage, just a procedural vote 
to break the Democratic leader’s fili-
buster and move forward with some-
thing. Senate Democrats, nevertheless, 
filibustered the aid. 
Then, just a few short days later, 
they went right back to signaling that 
a Democratic Senate majority paired 
with a President Joe Biden would abol-
ish the filibuster and permanently van-
dalize this institution to more easily 
force radical change on the country. 
This threat to permanently disfigure 
the Senate has been the latest growing 
drumbeat in the modern Democratic 
Party’s war against our governing in-
stitutions. 
There was former Senator Reid start-
ing the ‘‘nuclear’’ exchange back in 
2013. There have been years of unprece-
dented tactics to try and deny Presi-
dent Trump the government the people 
elected. There has been the least fair, 
least thorough, and most rushed im-
peachment inquiry in modern history. 
Now, the most shameless—the most 
shameless—hypocrisy: Senate Demo-
crats happily use the filibuster to 
block coronavirus relief and Senator 
TIM SCOTT’s police reform bill at the 
very same time they are conspiring to 
destroy that very tool so they can ram 
through their radical agenda if they 
ever win power. Grade A hypocrisy and 
nothing more. 
We have had former President Obama 
call for ‘‘eliminating the filibuster, an-
other Jim Crow relic,’’ about 1 month 
after his own party used it to kill Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT’s police reform bill. We 
have some of former Vice President 
Biden’s allies in the Senate day-
dreaming about ending the filibuster 
even as they themselves use the fili-
buster to kill pandemic relief for work-
ing families. 
Democrats want completely different 
sets of rules depending on whether they 
hold power—different sets of rules de-
pending upon whether they hold power. 
They want to assert minority rights 
when they have the minority and 
steamroll them if they get a majority. 
Here is NBC News: 
Democratic insiders are assembling a coa-
lition behind the scenes to wage an all-out 
war on the Senate filibuster. . . . Veteran 
party operatives, activist groups and sup-
portive Senators are coordinating message 
and strategy. 
This takes measuring the drapes to a 
new level. The Democratic leader and 
his colleagues aren’t just measuring 
the drapes; they are calculating how 
much kerosene it would take to burn 
the drapes down. 
They aren’t just threatening to pass 
radical policies like Medicare for none 
or the Green New Deal—no, no, no. The 
far left wants to hot-wire democracy 
itself—things like packing the Su-
preme Court with new seats or packing 
the Senate by handing out new state-
hood to one individual city. 
I said it a few months ago. Today’s 
Democrats have lost patience with 
playing by the rules and want to wage 
war on the rule book itself. They are 
saying as much out loud. 
Perhaps our colleagues think prom-
ising a shameless power grab is the 
only way to energize their radical, far- 
left base, but the real effect—the real 
effect—is to make the stakes in these 
issues completely and totally clear to 
the American people. 
The Framers designed the Senate to 
be the country’s firewall against ill- 
considered and radical change. That is 
what the Senate was all about in the 
beginning. If our Democratic friends 
have concluded their worst ideas could 
never clear the high bar—if they think 
their ideas could never clear the high 
bar, it is their bad ideas that need to be 
scrapped, not the core checks and bal-
ances of our government.

RACISM 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, the events 
of the last few months—what we have 
been seeing in the streets and the pro-
tests and all the issues that surround 
that—I think, have forced the country 
to grapple with our history on the issue 
of race and, in particular, what we 
teach young Americans about what 
that means and how it fits in the 
broader story of America. 
Is America, in fact, a nation founded 
on racism, one that makes our very 
founding and its principles almost irre-
deemable? It is an important question. 
You can’t ask Americans or any gen-
eration to sacrifice or defend a nation 
they believe is so deeply flawed, so it is 
one that I think we have to talk about. 
This country was founded in the year 
1776, and it was founded by this dec-
laration that all men are created equal; 
that your rights come from God, from 
your Creator. Now, we take those 
words for granted today. They were ex-
traordinarily radical ideas 244 years 
ago. Up until that time, every person 
on Earth was told that your rights are 
whatever the sovereign allowed you to 
have, whatever the King allowed you to 
have. You didn’t have any rights that 
were natural to you. So the very prin-
ciple itself was pretty radical.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5565 
September 14, 2020 
The problem is that, from the very 
beginning, 
many 
people, 
including 
those who put their name on that docu-
ment, and our laws at the time did not 
reflect that founding principle, and our 
story can largely be summarized as the 
244-year journey to more fully live up 
to the promises made at our founding. 
For our first 89 years as a nation, 
human beings were owned as slaves. 
And beyond just the horrors of slavery, 
they were the subject of torture, of 
rape, of seeing their children sold 
away—away from them—never to see 
them again. 
When that horrible institution fi-
nally came to an end, it was followed 
by another hundred years of separate 
and unequal, where Black Americans 
were told where they could live, where 
they could work, where they could go 
to school, and more. They were told 
where they could eat, where they could 
sit or not, where they were allowed to 
stay overnight. They were even told 
what side of the road they would be al-
lowed to walk on in many parts of this 
country. They were denied the right to 
vote, either directly or through intimi-
dation and threats. 
It was a time when, in many parts of 
this country, any Black man was one 
false accusation away from losing his 
life at the hands of a lynch mob. 
This is a shameful truth, an undeni-
able part of our history, a stain on our 
legacy as a nation. But it is not the 
whole story. From the very beginning, 
it was clear that the promise of our 
founding and our failure to live up to 
it—these two things could not ulti-
mately coexist. From the very begin-
ning, within a year and even before the 
founding of our Nation, there were al-
ready Americans working to end slav-
ery. Sometimes they paid for it with 
their lives. 
Ultimately, it became the single 
most divisive issue in the country, to 
the point that it was resolved only 
through a bloody civil war. For the 
next hundred years, during the era of 
separate and unequal, it was also 
Americans who worked to end segrega-
tion and Jim Crow laws, Americans of 
every walk of life: little children who 
would brave angry mobs to desegregate 
a school, the protesters and those in 
the streets who faced down ‘‘Bull’’ Con-
nor’s dogs and beatings, little girls who 
died when their church was bombed. 
Ours is not simply the story of a peo-
ple who, for 189 years, failed to live up 
to the promise of America. Ours is also 
the story of the Americans who ulti-
mately succeeded in making us a na-
tion that was closer to who we were 
supposed to be. 
That is why, at least for me, when 
they play the ‘‘National Anthem’’ and 
the flag that I face and put my hand 
over my heart to honor—that flag— 
that is not the flag of slave owners; 
that is the flag of the abolitionists. 
That is the flag of Harriet Tubman and 
Frederick Douglass, who were Amer-
ican heroes. The flag that I pledge alle-
giance to is not the flag of a segrega-
tionist. It is the flag of the Freedom 
Riders, the people who made the march 
from Selma to Montgomery. That is 
the flag of Rosa Parks and Dr. King. 
Our history does not simply belong 
to the villains. It belongs, even more 
so, to the heroes who, frankly, made us 
more American in each successive gen-
eration. 
I have heard in some corners people 
suggest that our founding documents 
themselves are documents embedded in 
racism because I imagine many of the 
people who signed it, indeed, were or 
did not live up to the words they signed 
their names on. But that would be for-
getting the fundamental fact that 
every single great movement in Amer-
ican 
history—every 
movement 
for 
equality in the history of this Nation— 
has not been a rejection of our found-
ing documents, has not been a rejec-
tion of our founding principles, has not 
been a call to overthrow the Constitu-
tion or the Declaration of Independ-
ence. Every one of these movements— 
great movements in the history of this 
country towards equality—has been an 
appeal to those principles, a demand 
that we live up to those principles. 
Dr. King said the magnificent words 
of the Constitution and the Declara-
tion of Independence—an appeal to our 
founding documents, which he called a 
promissory note to which every Amer-
ican was to fall heir. 
As we talk now about what is taught 
to our children in our schools and in 
our lives, I think our children deserve 
to know the truth about their coun-
try—all the truth. We must teach our 
children about the times in which our 
Nation fell short. We must teach them 
about the people responsible for our 
falling short. We must point to the 
times even now when we fall short. 
That is the only way you learn the les-
sons of history and the only way to 
avoid repeating them. But we must 
also teach them that it was Americans 
who dedicated and even lost their lives 
to end these evils. 
While we are at it, we should teach 
them, too, about the greatness of our 
country. Teach them about the young 
Americans who died far from home for 
the freedom and the liberty of others, 
who lost their lives at Iwo Jima and 
Guadalcanal and Normandy and the 
Ardennes and Chosin and Fallujah, on 
San Juan Hill and in Manila Bay. 
Teach them also about how, when dis-
aster strikes anywhere on this planet, 
it is their country that responds first 
and with the most—Fukushima, Japan, 
and West Berlin; after an earthquake 
hit Haiti; after floods impacted Paki-
stan—how it is Americans and their 
charities and their government that 
have literally saved the lives of mil-
lions of people on the African con-
tinent from starvation, from the rav-
ages of HIV-AIDS. Teach them how, on 
a summer night in 1969, the entire 
world stopped and watched with amaze-
ment as man first stepped foot on the 
Moon and there planted the flag of 
their country. 
Our children deserve to know the 
truth about their country, that in the 
history of mankind, there has never 
been a great power that has used its 
means to help more people and more 
places than anywhere in human his-
tory—no other great power in human 
history has done what the people of 
this Nation have done, both individ-
ually through the monies we give to 
charities and through their govern-
ment. This is also true about America. 
Our children deserve to know that 
they are citizens not of a perfect coun-
try but of the single greatest Nation in 
the history of all of mankind. They de-
serve to know that they are the heirs 
to a 244-year journey to achieve in one 
land a nation where all people are 
viewed as equal under the law, whose 
rights come from their Creator. They 
deserve to know that their country is a 
special one—one worth defending, one 
worth protecting, and one worth pass-
ing on to the generations that will fol-
low them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
WILDFIRES 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, because 
of raging fires in my home State of Or-
egon, many communities in my home 
State have been reduced to ashes. A 
number of others are experiencing 
what is known as the ice box effect, 
where, in effect, smoke blocks out the 
Sun, and it gets quite cool. Virtually 
all of Oregon is now choking on 
smoke—that is whether you are inside 
or outside at this point. Countless 
thousands of Oregonians are under 
evacuation orders. Many are quite lit-
erally fleeing for their lives and aban-
doning their homes as the flames ap-
proach. 
When I was home this weekend, I ini-
tially thought that a number of my 
communities had been hit by a wreck-
ing ball. That really understates the 
situation because usually when you get 
hit by a wrecking ball, there is a little 
bit left that is not just ashes. Now 
thousands of people in my State have 
lost their homes. They have lost their 
businesses. They have lost lifelong 
memories. 
I brought a flag to a family who lost 
in one of the fires the service flag of a 
loved one that they had cherished, and 
it just struck me that it is those kinds 
of memories, and losing them, that are 
as painful in many instances as losing 
houses and businesses. 
The death toll has been rising. Others 
are still missing and unaccounted for. 
Amid all the panic and loss, one of 
the aspects that left me, as I came 
back to Washington, with a bit of hope 
is that we lost so much, but we didn’t 
lose our spirit. We didn’t lose what we 
call the Oregon Way—neighbor helping 
neighbor, volunteers helping evacuees 
get food and water and shelter. Every-
body steps up when a crisis arrives; no-
body cares a whit about anybody’s poli-
tics. 
I have come to the floor today with a 
specific purpose, and that is to ask the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5566 
September 14, 2020 
Senate to match the same standard I 
saw of volunteers, neighbors, and Or-
egonians helping Oregonians this week-
end, to show the same kind of can-do 
spirit. 
The Presiding Officer of the Senate is 
new to this body. He has a State with 
a lot of rural terrain. I am going to be 
asking him and every Member of the 
Senate, all 100 of us, to say: Let’s make 
today the day when the Senate chose 
to finally get serious about fire that 
has harmed so many these last few 
weeks. Let’s make this the day when 
the Senate chose to take a dilapidated 
and out-of-date fire policy and replace 
it with a modern strategy for the real, 
on-the-ground conditions that have 
caused fires to magnify the pain that is 
being felt by millions today. 
The reason I am making this request 
of the Senate—that the Senate replace 
the way forest policy has been made in 
the past—is that those past processes— 
and, as my colleague already knows 
since he has been here now, the Senate 
moves often with glacially slow Senate 
processes, and those processes are now 
being totally overwhelmed by the mas-
sive infernos that are blanketing our 
communities and blanketing the West 
with smoke that is literally up to our 
eyeballs. The Presiding Officer in the 
Senate is a tall fellow. I am 6 feet 4 
inches. That is what I felt this week-
end. I and everybody else had smoke up 
to our eyeballs. 
The process the Senate has for deal-
ing with these new kinds of forest ca-
lamities—and there is no other way to 
describe it—those old procedures lack 
the urgency, lack the speed, lack, 
frankly, the resolute discipline for the 
incredibly big job that needs to be done 
and done quickly. 
So today I want to begin by offering 
three policies that I believe could be 
supported by every Senator, Democrats 
and Republicans. The first is that Con-
gress should pass a 21st Century Civil-
ian Conservation Corps Act. I have ac-
tually seen press in Missouri calling for 
this kind of approach, where young 
people 
are 
involved, 
securing 
jobs 
where they pay a living wage, and they 
can go in and shore up these commu-
nities threatened by fire. 
I want to emphasize that, having 
served on the Energy Committee now 
for several years, having authored the 
two major bills in the forestry area— 
the bill with Senator CRAPO—so we no 
longer waste so much money not budg-
eting for fire, brought about the end of 
fire borrowing so the big fires get 
taken care of in the disaster fund— 
don’t 
shortchange 
prevention—and 
then secure rural schools, which I 
think is also a policy that benefits peo-
ple all over the country in rural for-
ested areas. 
I will just offer the first. All over 
America, there are millions of acres of 
overstocked timber stands. They are 
hazardous fuels. It is urgent that we go 
in there, and we can use these hard- 
working young people to clean out 
those overstocked stands and reduce 
the risk of fire. Fire is inevitable. I 
know of no bill—none—that can abol-
ish fire. The question is, Can we take 
concrete steps to reduce the suffering 
and the damage of these big fires? 
(Ms. ERNST assumed the Chair.) 
I just gave one example of what the 
21st 
Century 
Civilian 
Conservation 
Corps could do. In my home State, 
there are more than 2 million acres 
backlogged in terms of these hazardous 
fuels that need to be reduced. You 
could have the 21st Century Civilian 
Conservation 
Corps—thousands 
of 
young people—going into every State 
and taking action to reduce these 
risks. There are a lot of other things 
that could be done by the 21st Century 
Civilian Conservation Corps. 
I learned this weekend that we are 
going to need to deploy new cell phone 
connectivity because a lot of people 
have lost those connections. In fact, 
one of the challenges in trying to de-
termine how many people we have lost 
is that we believe when the fires first 
hit, a lot of people went to a friend’s 
house and then the friend is not able to 
communicate because they lost cell 
phone connectivity. 
This is about having young people 
work on communications, having them 
clean out hazardous fuels, and having 
them work on stabilizing soils to pre-
vent massive flooding, because, make 
no mistake about it, all over the 
West—in 
Oregon, 
Washington, 
and 
California—we are going to need those 
soil stabilization projects to prevent 
massive flooding this spring. As sure as 
the night follows the day, it will be a 
problem. 
Using the 21st Century Civilian Con-
servation Corps, we can deploy folks 
into the forest and into our wildland- 
urban areas, where there is a connec-
tion—an interface—because we have a 
lot of fires in those areas, and the Ci-
vilian Conservation Corps can reduce 
hazardous fuels, prevent catastrophic 
fires, and they can do it on a grand 
scale. 
An ideal part of it and one of the rea-
sons I think this will appeal to Demo-
crats and Republicans is there doesn’t 
have to be a fight over carrying out our 
nation’s environmental laws. As I men-
tioned, in Oregon alone, there was al-
ready a backlog of more than 2 million 
acres that need to be treated. Without 
those treatments, a lightning strike or 
a carelessly dropped match can start 
yet another inferno. Just picture that. 
After everything that we had over the 
last few days, you have all of these haz-
ardous fuels built up and you have a 
lightning strike or a carelessly dropped 
match and, all of a sudden, you have 
ripped through thousands of other 
acres in the blink of an eye. 
Oregon’s forests and the forests of 
the West badly need this care and in-
vestment. It would really be an up-
dated version of one of the most pop-
ular programs the government has ever 
pursued, that came out of the New 
Deal, and it would be a huge economic 
boost to rural communities—I see the 
Presiding Officer from the State of 
Iowa—rural communities that feel like 
government has left them behind. 
That is my first proposal—the first of 
three—that I believe can help us come 
together as a Senate to reduce the dev-
astating toll of these fires that are not 
your grandfather’s fires. They are big-
ger and they are hotter and they are 
more powerful. We can do it together. 
The second area that I want to see 
the Senate focus on is addressing that 
the fires mean a lot more than spend-
ing all your money on just putting big 
fires out. Forest science has shown 
that wildfires are a part of the natural 
life cycle of certain parts of the Na-
tion. If all you do is focus on putting 
out fires all the time, you disrupt the 
cycle and that can lead to bigger fires 
down the road. 
But America no longer gets just man-
ageable natural fires. Instead, we get 
these huge infernos like the ones we 
have in Oregon, fires that are hot 
enough to melt a car and sterilize the 
soil. I ask the Presiding Officer to 
imagine how hot it has to be to melt a 
car. 
There is a need for another tool to 
help reduce the devastating effect of 
these great fires. It is supported by sci-
entists who have been looking at the 
various tools for dealing with these 
horrors—Democrats, Republicans—and 
it basically involves a prescribed fire 
that can be done safely in the off-sea-
sons, say, in the winter months. 
During those months, there is less 
risk of spread. You can limit the 
smoke. Civilian Conservation Corps 
workers working with the scientists at 
the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of 
Land Management, the Oregon Depart-
ment of Forestry, collaboratives, and 
our counties can carefully target these 
prescribed fires during the off-season 
and help prevent catastrophic fires in 
the summer and the fall by using the 
concept to clean out the dead and 
dying undergrowth. 
Here is the essence of my second 
proposition. If you use prescribed fire 
to burn a little when it is safe in the 
off-season, you can save a whole lot 
later on by preventing catastrophe dur-
ing those hotter months of summer and 
fall. 
I have a bill that I have been devel-
oping with the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee. I would say to my 
colleagues that this approach, like the 
21st 
Century 
Civilian 
Conservation 
Corps, will be ready for cosponsors 
later this week. I am going to be going 
to all of my colleagues to ask for sup-
port for this second commonsense ap-
proach to catastrophe avoidance. 
The third proposal brings it all to-
gether. Congress must finally kick its 
aversion to making long-term budget 
investments in treatment and fire pre-
vention. Managing our forests requires 
an investment that we essentially look 
to beyond the next 36 hours. Managing 
our forests for wildfire resilience needs

September 14, 2020 
to be approached as a longer term prop-
osition, one that can make our commu-
nities safer while generating jobs—tim-
ber for mills, improving recreation op-
portunities. And yet this has been an 
investment the Senate has been unwill-
ing to spend. 
Clearly, not enough has been done to 
deal with fire prevention. The fact that 
the 
Congress 
has 
constantly 
been 
shorting fire prevention is contributing 
to what is being seen in Oregon and 
throughout the West right now. Short-
ing fire prevention is the wrong way to 
go, and this item, No. 3, is literally a 
matter of life and death. 
Somehow, this Senate can produce 
hundreds of billions of dollars for tax 
breaks for special interests. There are 
outrageous, indefensible subsidies for 
fossil fuels that compound the climate 
crisis. 
Senator CRAPO and I—my colleague 
who sits just a few feet away, the Re-
publican of Idaho—worked for years in 
a bipartisan way to end what is called 
‘‘fire borrowing.’’ This is actually the 
first year when our bill has gone into 
effect. It got to the point where we 
needed over 300 citizens’ groups to pass 
this bill because so often the big fires 
were fought with prevention money— 
money borrowed from the prevention 
accounts, and then the fire just got 
worst. 
Senator CRAPO and I said that is fool-
ish, even by Washington, DC, stand-
ards. We were able to get a special fund 
created where the big fires would be 
fought from the disaster fund. But 
still, even with the beginning that Sen-
ator CRAPO and I have made on a bipar-
tisan basis, the budget for fire pre-
paredness and prevention is still so 
woefully short. More has to be done to 
limit the damage from staggeringly 
powerful forest fires, and one of the 
best ways to do it is to start building 
up that prevention fund that Senator 
CRAPO and I started here in the U.S. 
Senate. 
We laid the foundation, but it is 
clearly not enough. I checked, actu-
ally, a couple of days ago. There are $3 
billion now in the fund for fire suppres-
sion. We are sure going to need that be-
cause we have scores of fires still burn-
ing in Oregon, but we are going to need 
to build up preventive funds. And still, 
prevention as of today, September of 
2020, is woefully underfunded. 
The Forest Service has the technical 
tools it needs to improve forest health 
and to reduce the risk of fire, but, as I 
mentioned, there is a 2 million-acre 
backlog just in Oregon. Multiply that 
all over the West or all over the coun-
try where there are forests that are 
under the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Government and it is pretty clear that 
America has to decide it is urgent busi-
ness to build up the budget for fire pre-
vention. 
By allowing the fire prevention back-
log I have described to build, Congress 
is just racking up more debt—dan-
gerous debt—and the devastation and 
the smoke in Oregon and across the 
West today is the debt coming due. 
For those of us in the West who fear 
it is going to be impossible to pay the 
enormous bill that we have been hand-
ed through a combination of lousy for-
estry science and a disinterest in real 
policies that reduce climate change, we 
know the job is going to be hard, but 
we can and must do it by coming to-
gether like I saw Oregonians do just 
this last weekend. 
Before I wrap up, I want to mention 
that there sure have been some mis-
guided priorities on all sides of the po-
litical spectrum. On one side, some of 
the timber industry skipped past active 
management to pursue the golden calf 
of eliminating environmental laws. On 
the other side, misguided nonmanage-
ment priorities beat back every at-
tempt to manage our forests based on 
science. Now add to that the ridiculous 
new lies and delusions you are seeing 
online about the causes of these fires, 
and you have a recipe for distraction as 
to how the Senate must move forward. 
Just today, while visiting California, 
the President was asked about climate 
change and fires. He said: No problem. 
The President said, ‘‘It’ll start getting 
cooler,’’ and then he blamed ‘‘explosive 
trees.’’ Sending that kind of nonsense 
across the land is cold comfort to the 
families who are mourning the loved 
ones they have lost in the fires or the 
thousands of Oregonians who barely 
made it out before their homes and 
businesses went up in flames. 
The Senate has an obligation to act 
because around this country—and it is 
not just in my State but across the 
West—big-hearted neighbors, animal 
lovers, county employees, city admin-
istrators, 
local 
U-Haul 
businesses, 
teachers, nurses, and retirees—all of 
them—are stepping up and pitching in. 
They are bringing food and clothes and 
towels, and they are helping with men-
tal health services. 
Before I wrap up, I particularly want 
to thank the incredible firefighters 
who are working on hardly any sleep, 
and I thank the first responders, the 
police and others who are doing so 
much. One issue they are helping with 
is cell phones and service. My staff and 
others in the delegation have been 
working with these folks. 
I see my friend from Virginia, who 
knows a lot about what it takes to 
maintain communications networks, 
and that is what we are working on 
this afternoon. 
One problem that has come up is net-
works and equipment burn. There is a 
major strain on the resources for the 
people on the frontlines who are fight-
ing the inferno—for example, with the 
repeaters that can amplify a signal and 
keep our firefighters connected. I am 
hearing that this country doesn’t have 
enough repeaters in stock to begin to 
address such a crisis that the West is 
experiencing. It is another example of 
what happens when, year after year, 
you ignore the urgent need for serious 
fire prevention. 
Before I left Oregon, I told some 
friends that I was going to come back 
and try to bring the Senate together 
around fire prevention. 
One said: Well, you are going to be 
Mr. Fire Prevention. 
I said: No, that is not how it works. 
I would like to make this the Senate 
that is known for fire prevention and 
the Senate that said, between there 
and here, there are 100 U.S. Senators, 
and we have differences of opinion. 
Lord knows that this is the case. But I 
offered concrete proposals, 21st Cen-
tury 
Conservation 
Corps-prescribed 
changes in the budget that Democrats 
and Republicans can come together on. 
The reason I say that is that we have 
already done it. That is how Senator 
CRAPO and I ended fire borrowing. 
I close with this: What I saw this 
weekend 
was 
heartbreaking—thou-
sands of families mourning unthink-
able loss, trying to figure out how to 
move forward when their homes and 
their possessions had been reduced to 
ash. Yet, when you talk to them, they 
will tell you that they also know that 
the problem is not going to get better 
all by itself—I know there are Senators 
who want to debate this—and that is 
because the climate crisis is here, right 
now, today. 
It is no longer a far-off hypothetical 
danger for Senators to debate in com-
fortably air-conditioned buildings. The 
American West—my State—is on fire. 
Whole neighborhoods and whole com-
munities are being reduced to ashes. 
Our air quality has had the dubious 
recognition over the last couple of days 
of being some of the worst in the world. 
The climate crisis is happening now to 
us and to our kids. America and the 
Senate ignore it at our peril. 
I brought today three concrete pro-
posals that I think make a serious con-
tribution to reducing the pain and suf-
fering that have been seen across Or-
egon and across the West over the last 
couple of days. I want this to be the 
day the Senate gets serious about fire 
prevention as part of a comprehensive 
effort to fight the climate crisis. 
The ideas I have outlined—the three 
major proposals—ought to become law 
soon, and they ought to have bipar-
tisan support. They are policies that 
will protect our communities and the 
families who live in them and that will 
protect jobs, protect homes, and pro-
tect businesses. They sure are a lot 
cheaper because they will prevent fires 
rather than force a bigger pricetag 
when we need to rebuild communities 
out of the ashes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I 
have come to the floor to talk about a 
different subject, but I want to com-
mend my good friend, the Senator from 
Oregon, for his comments. We all 
watched with horror this weekend the 
images from his State and from those 
in Washington and California that were 
literally like something out of Dante’s 
‘‘Inferno.’’ 
I have enormous respect for the Sen-
ator from Oregon, and he can count on

me to be behind him on these pro-
posals. I know they will be reasonable, 
and I know they will be straight-
forward. Boy oh boy. If, when we see 
those images, we are not able to step 
up with a commonsense, bipartisan, 
and quick response, then shame on all 
of us. I commend the Senator for his 
leadership, and I look forward to work-
ing with him. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Madam President, as if that isn’t 
enough—and with the challenges we 
face with having close to 200,000 of our 
fellow citizens dead from coronavirus 
and there still being no national plan 
on PPE or testing or, my fear, that we 
could see a repeat of the mistakes that 
were made on testing and PPE happen 
on vaccinations if we are not careful— 
what I actually came to talk about and 
to remind my colleagues about is some-
thing that the Senator from Oregon 
will also be very, very involved in. I ex-
press my grave concern that we are 
only 16 days away from a potential 
lapse in government funding. 
It is encouraging that Secretary 
Mnuchin and Speaker PELOSI seem to 
have reached at least an agreement in 
principle on this must-pass stopgap 
funding, but I have been around here 
long enough to know that when nego-
tiations between and within two Cham-
bers 
on 
supposedly 
must-pass 
coronavirus relief legislation breaks 
down and stalls—and when that break-
down lasts for months—that we cannot 
let the funding of our government get 
mired in the same complacency and 
lack of urgency. 
I hope and pray that the devastating 
impact of the 2018–2019 government 
shutdown is still in the front minds of 
all of my colleagues here in the Senate. 
I acknowledge it has been a long year, 
so here is a little recap for those who 
need it. 
The government shutdown over the 
holiday of 2018 and into the beginning 
of the new year of 2019 was the longest 
shutdown of the Federal Government 
in history—not of this Congress’s and 
not under this administration but in 
our country’s history. 
For 35 days, the Federal Government 
did not hold up its end of the bargain 
with taxpayers or the public servants 
who have dedicated their lives to deliv-
ering services to them. The economic 
impact and human toll were dev-
astating. More than 380,000 Federal 
workers were furloughed, and another 
450,000 were forced to work without 
pay. While Federal employees eventu-
ally 
received 
backpay, 
furloughed 
workers who happened to be contrac-
tors still have not been made whole. To 
put that in context, contractors, in-
cluding those who had served the Fed-
eral Government as custodians, cafe-
teria workers, and security guards, had 
to figure out how to pay rent and buy 
medicine and put food on the table 
after two entire paychecks just evapo-
rated. 
The economic effects were not just 
personal 
either. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget Office estimates that the 2018– 
2019 government shutdown cost tax-
payers—cost all of us—about $3 billion. 
It actually registered as a decrease in 
2019’s gross domestic product of about 
two-tenths of a percent. Those will be 
losses that we will never recover. 
As bad as that all sounds, that was 
only a partial government shutdown. 
There were 9 out of 15 Departments and 
several Agencies that were closed. 
What we are facing in a couple of 
weeks would affect the entire Federal 
Government. To state the obvious, that 
was when we were not in a global pan-
demic and an economic recession. Vir-
ginians and people across the country 
continue relying on services from the 
Federal Government to help keep their 
families and businesses afloat. 
I am sure the administration will 
take steps to ensure people continue to 
receive their most essential things, 
like SNAP benefits to keep their fami-
lies fed and PPP loans to keep their 
businesses afloat. Shutting down the 
entire Federal Government will inevi-
tably lead to disruptions and bare-bone 
contingency matters. 
The 
American 
people 
need 
and, 
frankly, deserve better. With food inse-
curity, housing instability, and job loss 
all on the rise, now is the time for the 
Federal Government to do more to help 
everyday people—not by turning the 
lights out. Shutting down the govern-
ment just as we are expecting a surge 
in COVID–19 cases post-Labor Day and 
as the flu season is starting and as we 
are needing to work double time to se-
cure the November election and as the 
Postal Service needs relief and, as Sen-
ator WYDEN just indicated, as the en-
tire west coast is burning—boy oh boy. 
Calling it a self-inflicted injury doesn’t 
even cut it. If we were to shut down, it 
would be more like kicking ourselves. 
Failing to reach an agreement on fund-
ing the government would be abso-
lutely disastrous. 
I can only hope that there will be bi-
partisan agreement on this point and 
that we will be able to put aside any of 
the unrelated policy differences to ful-
fill one of our most basic obligations as 
lawmakers—that of funding the gov-
ernment and keeping our commitments 
to both our constituents and the Fed-
eral workforce that works so tirelessly 
to serve them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BROADBAND 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise to address broadband connectivity 
and broadband access in rural States 
like the Presiding Officer’s State and 
my State of West Virginia. 
Our Nation has experienced a very 
tough couple of months because of the 
coronavirus pandemic. With the new 
normal consisting of teleworking, vir-
tual learning, and telehealth appoint-
ments, there is no question that this 
has forced us to recognize and to reck-
on with the digital divide in this coun-
try. The ability to have affordable and 
reliable service is more valuable than 
ever. 
However, in 2020, my State remains 
one of the least connected States in the 
country. Over the last few months, I 
have heard from many constituents— 
hundreds of my constituents—who are 
having difficulties properly and effi-
ciently working from home, helping 
their kids with their homework be-
cause they lack robust internet access. 
You know, I think about those chil-
dren 
who 
either 
don’t 
have 
connectivity or don’t have an adult in 
the home who can really help them do 
their digital learning. We have to get 
our kids back in school, but in the 
meantime 
we 
have 
to 
have 
this 
connectivity. 
Some examples of this are Randy 
from Parkersburg, whom I spoke to re-
cently during a tele-townhall meeting 
that I held with constituents. Randy 
expressed his frustration with not 
being able to access the internet, mak-
ing it difficult for his kids to complete 
their homework. He was driving to a 
hot spot. 
Laura from Wheeling expressed her 
concern that her children will fall be-
hind in school without access to their 
homework online. 
And Mandy from Elkins, who is a 
professor, needs internet because of re-
quired online learning at Davis & Elk-
ins. 
These are just examples of the few of 
the concerns that I have heard from 
my constituents, but, unfortunately, 
there are many, many more just like 
those. I am sure you are hearing them 
as well in the great State of Iowa. 
The reality is that broadband build-
out in rural areas of West Virginia and 
across our country are extremely ex-
pensive and take more time to com-
plete because, in our case, we have 
those beautiful West Virginia moun-
tains. I have always said that if we can 
communicate with somebody on the 
Moon, we can surely find a way to de-
liver broadband to individuals, fami-
lies, and businesses all across this Na-
tion. 
Fortunately, the FCC Chairman, Ajit 
Pai, understands this and has been 
working with the other Commissioners 
at the FCC to structure the future of 
rural 
broadband 
deployment. 
The 
FCC’s upcoming Rural Digital Oppor-
tunity Fund—which I am going to call 
it RDOF, which is how we address it— 
is 
the 
largest 
Federal 
investment 
aimed at closing the digital divide. 
RDOF will award $20.4 billion over 
the next 10 years for broadband service 
in rural America, with a special em-
phasis at the beginning on those who 
are totally unserved and then moving 
to those who have some service, but it 
is inadequate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5569 
September 14, 2020 
The first phase of the funding will be 
up to $16 billion deployed through a re-
verse auction, which is slated to begin 
next month. 
On Friday, I talked with Chairman 
Pai for an update on the RDOF Pro-
gram and what it will mean to West 
Virginia. 
We also discussed where my State 
stands in the process. West Virginia is 
set to receive a significant amount of 
funding over the next 10 years to con-
nect 121,000 eligible homes—so that is 
probably over 200,000 individuals—par-
ticularly those in the underserved 
areas, as I mentioned. 
During my call with the Chairman, I 
received assurances that the FCC has 
been diligently working to get as many 
providers into the RDOF Program as 
possible. 
The FCC has already provided feed-
back to providers on their short-form 
applications so that they may be pre-
pared to bid in the upcoming auction 
next month. 
Another partner in my quest to close 
this digital divide is West Virginia 
Governor Jim Justice. Recently, the 
Governor signed an executive order to 
help expand broadband capabilities in 
West Virginia—very innovatively, I 
might add. His executive order would 
remove the regulatory cap on the 
amount of money that West Virginia’s 
EDA can provide as loan insurance for 
broadband projects. In other words, the 
State is going to stand behind these 
providers to make sure we get our 
share of the RDOF money. 
This is an innovative and bipartisan 
Federal-State partnership that hope-
fully will allow more local providers to 
successfully bid on the majority of the 
RDOF census blocks in our State. 
These areas are oftentimes the most 
challenging to serve, and we need to 
ensure that our local providers—that 
are ready and able to connect their 
communities 
with 
high-speed 
broadband—have the ability to com-
pete in the upcoming auction. 
Our Governor’s bipartisan effort is 
supported by leaders in both the major-
ity and minority party of both cham-
bers of the West Virginia Legislature, 
including the Senate president, Mitch 
Carmichael; our house speaker, Roger 
Hanshaw; the Senate minority leader, 
Roman Prezioso—whom I would like to 
thank for his service, as he is leaving 
the senate—and also the house minor-
ity leader, Tim Miley, who is also leav-
ing, and I would like to thank him for 
his service. 
So what is next and how do we con-
tinue to improve on this progress? One 
major undertaking is improving the 
FCC’s 
broadband 
maps 
with 
more 
granular data. Far too often these 
maps show rural areas that are cov-
ered, but, in reality, if you are living in 
and around the area, you know they 
are not covered. There is no service. It 
is not the case. 
This data collection and correction is 
tedious but critical, as these maps 
often determine funding levels and 
what areas are prioritized, naturally. 
As cochair of the Senate Broadband 
Caucus, I cosponsored the Broadband 
DATA Act, which this body passed last 
year and President Trump signed into 
law in March. 
This new law will lead to the cre-
ation of a singular Federal broadband 
map, with new more granular data col-
lected by the FCC from State and local 
governments, consumers, and other 
third parties, and will be updated bian-
nually. 
It would create an online mechanism 
where individuals can challenge the 
coverage maps. Let’s say you live in an 
area and you say: Well, they are saying 
I am covered, and you know darn well 
you are living in a place that is uncov-
ered. You can submit that data online, 
and it will be submitted to the pro-
viders. 
It also requires regular auditing of 
data submitted by providers, allowing 
for crowdsourcing verification. This is 
important, too, because if you are 
grading yourself, you are going to give 
yourself a better grade, but if you are 
grading yourself and then you have a 
third-party verifier who is actually 
making sure that the data you are put-
ting forward is correct, you might be 
just a little more circumspect about 
how accurate that data is. 
Another step forward would be dove-
tailing road infrastructure with fiber 
broadband buildout. We all recognize 
broadband is infrastructure, and a ‘‘dig 
once’’ approach would sure save time 
and money. Digging through those 
mountains is pretty tough so we only 
want to dig once if we have to. 
This is why I am happy to see that 
the Department of Transportation’s 
Federal Highway Administration in 
mid-August made an announcement of 
a new rule to improve coordination in 
the use of highway rights-of-way to 
support the installation of broadband 
technologies. 
In other words, they are making it 
regulatorily easier at the Federal level 
to move forward. 
This proposed rule would help ensure 
that the digging required to install 
utilities would also be utilized for 
broadband infrastructure. That makes 
sense, doesn’t it? This would help cut 
down on the expense associated with 
the deployment into rural areas. 
The good news is, this issue is one of 
the few issues that lawmakers on both 
sides of the aisle are eager to work on 
together. We will continue to have ob-
stacles ahead as we seek to close this 
digital divide, but I believe it is impor-
tant to note the progress that we have 
made up to this point. 
Five years ago, I created my Capito 
Connect Plan, which is a roadmap for 
bringing affordable, high-speed inter-
net access to homes, businesses, and 
classrooms in my State of West Vir-
ginia. 
Each year, we have made significant 
strides, and I am proud of these accom-
plishments that have been made. Are 
we all the way there? No. That is why 
I am talking about it today—how im-
portant it is, especially in this COVID 
environment. 
So, 
for 
example, 
there 
is 
the 
Facebook Fiber Project. I personally 
asked 
founder 
and 
CEO 
Mark 
Zuckerberg, during a Commerce Com-
mittee hearing, for his commitment to 
partner with West Virginia on rural 
fiber 
deployment. 
They 
announced 
they are investing 275 miles of long- 
haul fiber right through the southern 
portion of the State. I just drove by it 
on my way here. I can see the big coils, 
and they are moving forward with that. 
Other investments are the State’s 
first fiber infrastructure investment 
from Zayo. They will be constructing a 
similar build through the northern 
part of the State. 
I have also worked to leverage Fed-
eral agencies like the USDA and their 
ReConnect Program to invest in West 
Virginia with Federal grants and loans. 
Since the launch of my initiative, I 
have successfully delivered $37 million 
in funding for residential broadband 
projects through the USDA Programs 
and will continue in those efforts. 
Last month, I was in rural Preston 
County, where I witnessed firsthand as 
broadband service was being installed 
to the home of Beverly and Jeff 
Stemple. This fiber installation project 
was funded by the USDA’s Community 
Connect project and made possible by 
those initiatives. 
I also visited Lincoln Primary Care 
in Hamlin, WV, which received a tele-
medicine grant from the FCC to help 
provide better care in Southern West 
Virginia, and they have a great plan 
that they are going to put in their 
community health centers and about 5 
or 6 counties in 17 locations. 
We have had a great deal of success 
with also identifying new areas for cell 
towers—one in Lincoln County. We vis-
ited with the providers there. 
As you can see, all levels of govern-
ment, along with the private sector, 
along with our municipalities and our 
local leaders, have stepped up to the 
plate to work toward this common 
goal. 
Capito Connect is making a dif-
ference of connecting thousands of 
West Virginians. I have worked with 
colleagues on both side of the aisle 
through my committee work and also 
worked with the administration, which 
has truly prioritized this issue. 
Perhaps one upside to the pandemic— 
or I would say better maybe lessons 
learned—is that it has helped us better 
appreciate the time that we can phys-
ically spend with one another. But les-
sons learned are we cannot disadvan-
tage certain parts of this country be-
cause you don’t have what I consider to 
be one of the essentials in order to do 
business, to have healthcare, and to 
learn, and that is the deployment of 
high-speed broadband. 
Getting back to the human connec-
tion—wow. It is so important, and I 
know we miss it. A lot of us miss it. 
But it makes our work on broadband 
all that much more important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

September 14, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
FREE SPEECH 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it seems like every other week we 
turn on the TV only to hear a pundit 
declare that we are living in the most 
divisive time in the history of our Na-
tion. Now, as I am sure many would 
point out, especially if we were having 
this discussion on social media, those 
who lived through the Civil War and 
other contentious eras might have 
something to say about that, but we 
can all agree it is a contentious time. 
What I know for sure is this: Every 
single day I see the American people 
losing the hope they once had in the 
absolute inviolability of our funda-
mental right to free speech and expres-
sion. They may not be too worried 
about official action changing those 
rights, but what they do see is a dwin-
dling respect for what those rights 
mean outside of the context of what 
lawyers and lawmakers understand as 
protected speech. They are not think-
ing about Supreme Court cases. They 
are wondering what changed in the 
hearts and minds of their countrymen 
to turn simple disagreements into all- 
out war. They long for the days when 
they would have friendly banter with 
their neighbors and with their friends 
and discuss the issues of the day. 
Well, over the past few months, I 
have watched this national discourse 
spiral to the point where most people I 
talked to back home believe that civil 
debate is just about impossible, and it 
worries them. What happened to mu-
tual respect? What happened to point- 
counterpoint? What happened to civil 
discourse in the public square? What 
happened to sitting around the table 
after a Sunday School class and talk-
ing about how what you have discussed 
applies to the issues of the day? Have 
we lost it? 
I have witnessed obvious efforts to 
threaten and intimidate conservative 
activists. I have watched these go un-
checked by powerful legal figureheads 
who should have known better. And 
what is worse, these threats and in-
timidation tactics have spilled over 
into the online platforms millions of 
Americans use to check the news, stay 
connected to friends, and share updates 
on the lives of their families. 
Now, I think we can agree that most 
of our friends in Silicon Valley who are 
in charge of those platforms harbor 
some liberal bias. That being said, I 
think we can also agree that doesn’t 
mean they can’t be objective when it 
comes to things like content modera-
tion. Of course, that is not how it 
works out in real life. The modern era’s 
hostility toward debate provides those 
platforms with a perverse incentive 
just to flip the switch, shut down con-
servative voices, and then suggest that 
we had it coming all along: You 
shouldn’t have been saying such. Well, 
we all know that this seems to be a 
one-sided argument. 
Now, those in this Chamber who fol-
low technology policy know that Big 
Tech uses the liability shield granted 
under section 230 of the Communica-
tions Decency Act to justify this type 
of censorship. In part, the statute 
reads: 
No provider or user of an interactive com-
puter service shall be held liable on account 
of—any action voluntarily taken in good 
faith to restrict access to or availability of 
material that the provider or user considers 
to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, exces-
sively violent, harassing, or otherwise objec-
tionable, whether or not such material is 
constitutionally protected. 
Remember that ‘‘otherwise objec-
tionable’’ catchall. That is going to be 
important. Congress originally con-
structed those provisions to protect 
startups and innovators from frivolous 
content 
moderation 
lawsuits 
that 
could either bankrupt their firms or se-
verely restrict their access to venture 
capital. But, in reality, Big Tech has 
abused this privilege. 
Now, listen to this part because this 
also is as important as that ‘‘otherwise 
objectionable’’ phrase. Congress origi-
nally constructed these provisions of 
section 230 to protect startups and 
innovators from frivolous content mod-
eration lawsuits that could either 
bankrupt their firms or severely re-
strict their access to venture capital. 
This was done because the internet was 
in its infancy, and people wanted to 
make certain they could get their sea 
legs underneath them, have a little 
space, and be able to innovate. If they 
made mistakes, they would be able to 
rectify those mistakes and not get 
sued. 
Those days are long gone, and, yes, 
Big Tech has abused this privilege. 
They became very comfortable with 
looking at section 230 and using it as a 
way to issue take-down notices, as a 
way to restrict content, and as a way 
to manipulate prioritization. It came 
in line with their thought processes 
and their ideas, but, in reality, we 
know that this has become an excuse 
to censor content that they disagree 
with in principle, and, in doing so, they 
have damaged—perhaps in some ways 
irreparably—the integrity of the na-
tional discourse. 
The problem isn’t just that they have 
unilaterally imposed their own pre-
ferred content filter into the browser 
and news feeds of millions of Ameri-
cans and manipulated the availability 
and quality of the information; it is 
that in the process of doing so, they 
have trained their customers to expect 
that filter to cover their real-world 
interactions with people whose beliefs 
are much more diverse than those of 
the Silicon Valley’s wealthiest resi-
dents. 
You know, this is one of those Holly-
wood versus the heartland sorts of 
issues. They think they know better 
than the people across this country, so 
they feel that they can impose their 
own filter onto your browser and your 
news feed and thereby manipulate the 
availability and the quality of informa-
tion to which you are going to have ac-
cess, and they are doing it because 
they can, they think, because they 
have been using 230 as their shield. 
Last week, I joined my colleagues 
Senators WICKER and GRAHAM to intro-
duce the Online Freedom and View-
point Diversity Act, and I thank them 
for their willingness to work with me 
and to move a product to completion 
and introduction. To introduce this 
legislation means we are introducing 
accountability into our dealings with 
this notoriously opaque and unregu-
lated industry. 
To be clear, this piece of legislation 
isn’t meant to construct a new set of 
guide rails that will let Washington 
dictate the inner workings of a plat-
form’s content moderation strategy. 
What it does is change the language of 
the existing statute to clarify some 
ambiguous terminology. Basically, you 
are clarifying who can use liability 
protection, when they can use it, how 
they can use it, and where it can be ap-
plied. 
First and foremost, the bill clarifies 
those scenarios when an online plat-
form’s decision to restrict access—re-
strict it, censoring, diminishing, push-
ing it back—to certain types of content 
will result in their losing that section 
230 shield. Did they do it because they 
wanted to or did they do it because it 
is language that should be shielded and 
taken down? 
This provision will address those fa-
mously vague content moderation poli-
cies that are almost impossible for 
users to challenge. How many times 
have you looked at terms of service 
and how many times have you looked 
at community standards and said: I 
can’t figure out what this means. Guess 
what. Most people cannot. And the on-
line platform—it is fine with them if 
you can’t figure it out. It gives them 
more latitude. 
Next, it conditions the content mod-
eration liability shield on a reasonable-
ness standard. In order to be protected 
from liability, a tech company may 
only restrict access to content where it 
has an ‘‘objectively reasonable belief’’ 
that the content falls within a certain 
specified category. 
So the purpose of this is to take 
away the benefit of the doubt. We want 
them to really think before restricting 
content. What they have done is just 
take it down—no fear that their hands 
would be slapped. And what do we 
know about Big Tech? They are going 
to push the envelope until they get 
their hands slapped. 
So, instead of giving them the benefit 
of the doubt, the next time they decide 
they are going to go in here and they 
are going to take something down, we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5571 
September 14, 2020 
want to give them pause. They need to 
think before they do that. 
Our update removes the ‘‘otherwise 
objectionable’’ standard that I men-
tioned previously, and it replaces it 
with some specific terms that would 
protect platforms when they remove 
content that promotes terrorism, pro-
motes self-harm, or is unlawful. 
You know, it is a good thing when 
Congress can be specific in what they 
mean and when they can be specific in 
the intent of the law. Changing this 
language would provide that specificity 
that is needed. 
Last but not least, the bill clarifies 
the definition of ‘‘information content 
provider’’ to include a person or entity 
that creates, develops, or editorializes 
information 
provided 
through 
the 
internet or any other online platform. 
Now, this will help online publishers, 
periodicals, and websites that are news 
websites. But then you have Big Tech 
block them because somebody puts up 
something in the comment section that 
Big Tech doesn’t like. Of course, we all 
are familiar with Mark Zuckerberg 
saying that his company, Facebook, 
works more like a government than a 
corporation. So, this pulls back on 
what they have used as their control. 
There has been a lot of discussion in 
this Chamber regarding the best way to 
handle section 230. Many argue that we 
would all be better off if Congress 
wiped the statute off the books and 
just got rid of it completely. But I will 
tell you, I fully believe that is a mis-
guided approach. That strategy will 
not temper the effects of Big Tech’s 
bias because their bias stretches far be-
yond interactions that raise section 230 
concerns. 
This isn’t a simple issue. Those of us 
who have been working on section 230 
for years are still studying the ripple 
effects these changes will bring. What 
we know for sure is that simply closing 
the book on section 230 via congres-
sional decree would be like casting a 
protest vote against Big Tech’s bad be-
havior. It would be absolutely point-
less. 
Until we recognize the importance of 
clarifying and preserving liability pro-
tections for the internet we have now 
and not—not—the internet we had in 
1996, Big Tech will keep pushing the 
boundaries until private corporations 
will become judge and jury over not 
only how Americans discover new in-
formation but what information is ac-
tually there to discover. 
It is time for the U.S. Senate to step 
up, to do the work, and to write those 
changes into law.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 689 
Whereas Alyaksandr Lukashenka has ruled 
Belarus as an undemocratic dictatorship 
since the first presidential election in 
Belarus in 1994; 
Whereas subsequent presidential elections 
in Belarus have been neither free nor fair 
and have been rejected by the international 
community as not meeting minimal elec-
toral standards, with the jailing of opposi-
tion activists frequently used as a tool of 
government repression before and after the 
elections; 
Whereas, in response to the repression and 
violence during the 2006 presidential elec-
tion, Congress passed the Belarus Democracy 
Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109– 
480); 
Whereas, in March 2011, the Senate unani-
mously 
passed 
Senate 
Resolution 
105, 
which— 
(1) condemned the December 2010 election 
in Belarus as ‘‘illegitimate, fraudulent, and 
not representative of the will or the aspira-
tions of the voters in Belarus’’; and 
(2) called on the Lukashenka regime ‘‘to 
immediately and unconditionally release all 
political prisoners in Belarus who were ar-
rested in association with the December 19, 
2010, election’’; 
Whereas, in advance of the August 2020 
presidential elections in Belarus, authorities 
acting on behalf of President Lukashenka ar-
rested journalists, bloggers, political activ-
ists, and opposition leaders, including three 
leading presidential candidates (Syarhey 
Tsikhanouski, 
Mikalay 
Statkevich, 
and 
Viktar Babaryka), who were barred from 
running in the election by the Central Elec-
tion Commission of the Republic of Belarus; 
Whereas, while the three opposition can-
didates were imprisoned, two of their wives 
and 
one 
of 
their 
campaign 
managers, 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, 
Veranika 
Tsepkala, and Maria Kalesnikava, joined to-
gether and ran in place of the candidates; 
Whereas thousands of Belarusian people 
demonstrated their support for these can-
didates by attending rallies, including one 
rally that included an estimated 63,000 par-
ticipants; 
Whereas, on August, 5, 2020, the Senate 
unanimously passed Senate Resolution 658, 
which calls for a free, fair, and transparent 
presidential election in Belarus, including 
the unimpeded participation of all presi-
dential candidates;

September 14, 2020 
Whereas presidential elections were held in 
Belarus on August 9, 2020, under undemo-
cratic conditions with reports of malfea-
sance on the part of Lukashenka’s govern-
ment, including early voting ballot stuffing, 
ballot burning, pressuring poll workers, and 
removing bags full of ballots by climbing out 
of windows; 
Whereas incumbent president Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka declared a landslide victory in 
the election and claimed to have received 
more than 80 percent of the votes cast in the 
election; 
Whereas the leading opposition candidate, 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya— 
(1) formally disputed the government’s re-
ported election results; 
(2) explained that her staff had examined 
the election results from more than 50 poll-
ing places; and 
(3) found that her share of the vote exceed-
ed Lukashenka’s share by many times; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2020, Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya was detained while attend-
ing a meeting with the Central Election 
Commission of the Republic of Belarus and 
forced to flee to Lithuania under pressure 
from government authorities; 
Whereas, on August 11, 2020, Lithuanian 
Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicˇius an-
nounced that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was 
safe in Lithuania and has continued to be 1 
of the strongest voices supporting the pro- 
democracy movement in Belarus within the 
European Union and globally; 
Whereas, on August 11, 2020, the European 
Union High Representative for Foreign and 
Security Policy, Josep Borrell, issued a dec-
laration on the presidential election in 
Belarus stating that the elections were nei-
ther free nor fair; 
Whereas, on August 18, 2020, Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya announced the formation of 
a Coordination Council to oversee a resolu-
tion to the crisis in Belarus and a peaceful 
transition of power; 
Whereas, on August 19, 2020, European 
Council President Charles Michel announced 
that the European Union would impose sanc-
tions on a substantial number of individuals 
responsible for violence, repression, and elec-
tion fraud in Belarus; 
Whereas, on August 28, 2020, United States 
Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun 
declared that the August 9th election in 
Belarus was fraudulent; 
Whereas, since the sham election on Au-
gust 9, 2020, tens of thousands of Belarusian 
citizens have participated in daily peaceful 
protests calling for a new, free, and fair elec-
tion, and the release of political prisoners; 
Whereas according to Amnesty Inter-
national, on August 30, 2020, Belarusians held 
one of the largest protest rallies in the coun-
try’s modern history in Minsk and in other 
cities, which was attended by at least 100,000 
people who demanded the resignation of 
President Lukashenka and an investigation 
into the human rights violations in Belarus; 
Whereas women have played a leading role 
in the protests, including by forming peace-
ful 
solidarity 
chains 
of 
thousands 
of 
Belarusians symbolically dressed in white; 
Whereas more than 7,000 Belarusian citi-
zens have been detained by government au-
thorities, mostly for taking part in or ob-
serving peaceful protests, with many of these 
arrests followed by beatings and torture at 
the hands of Belarusian law enforcement; 
Whereas authorities in Belarus have con-
sistently restricted press freedom as part of 
the crackdown, including— 
(1) the arrest of dozens of journalists, six of 
whom report for Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty; 
(2) blocking more than 50 news websites 
that were covering the protests; 
(3) halting the publishing of two inde-
pendent newspapers; and 
(4) stripping the accreditation of journal-
ists working for foreign news outlets; 
Whereas internet access in Belarus has 
been repeatedly disrupted and restricted 
since August 9, 2020, which independent ex-
perts and monitoring groups have attributed 
to government interference; 
Whereas after employees of state media 
outlets walked off the job in protest rather 
than help report misleading government 
propaganda, Lukashenka confirmed that he 
‘‘asked the Russians’’ to send teams of Rus-
sian journalists to replace local employees; 
Whereas Lukashenka appealed to Russian 
President Vladimir Putin to provide security 
assistance to his government, if requested, 
and Putin confirmed that a reserve police 
force was ready to be deployed if ‘‘the situa-
tion gets out of control’’; 
Whereas the Belarus Ministry of Defense 
threatened to send the army to confront 
protestors, warning that in case of any viola-
tion of peace and order in areas around na-
tional monuments, ‘‘you will have the army 
to deal with now, not the police’’; 
Whereas, according to the Viasna Human 
Rights Centre, at least 450 detainees have re-
ported being tortured or otherwise ill-treat-
ed while held in incommunicado detention 
for up to 10 days, including through— 
(1) severe beatings; 
(2) forced performance of humiliating acts; 
and 
(3) sexual violence and other forms of vio-
lence; 
Whereas at least four Belarusians have 
been killed at protests, and dozens of 
Belarusians who were detained during the 
protests are still missing; 
Whereas, on or around September 6, 2020, 
the opposition leader, Maria Kalesnikava, 
and members of the Coordination Council, 
including Anton Ronenkov, Ivan Kravtsov, 
and Maxim Bogretsov, were detained by au-
thorities who sought to forcibly expel them 
to Ukraine; 
Whereas 
opposition 
leader 
Maria 
Kolesnikova tore up her passport at the 
Ukrainian border in a successful effort to 
prevent this expulsion, subsequently dis-
appeared, and was discovered in a Minsk 
prison on September 9, 2020; 
Whereas the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, done at New York 
December 19, 1966, was ratified by Belarus in 
1973, guaranteeing Belarusians the freedom 
of expression and the freedom of association; 
and 
Whereas, in 2006, President George W. Bush 
issued Executive Order 13405, titled ‘‘Block-
ing Property of Certain Persons Under-
mining Democratic Processes or Institutions 
in Belarus’’, which authorized the imposition 
of sanctions against persons responsible for— 
(1) undermining democratic processes in 
Belarus; or 
(2) participating in human rights abuses 
related to political repression in Belarus: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) finds that— 
(A) the elections held in Belarus on August 
9, 2020, were neither free nor fair; and 
(B) the results announced by the Central 
Election Commission of the Republic of

the peaceful protests and pro-democracy 
movement in Belarus;

on, arbitrary arrests of, and violence against 
peaceful 
protesters, 
opposition 
leaders, 
human rights activists, and independent 
media by authorities in Belarus; 
(5) condemns the unjustified detention and 
forced or attempted expulsion of members of 
the Coordination Council in Belarus; 
(6) demands the release of all political pris-
oners and those arrested for peacefully pro-
testing, including those arrested before the 
August 9, 2020 election; 
(7) applauds the commitment by foreign 
diplomats in Minsk to engage with Coordina-
tion Council member and Nobel Laureate, 
Svetlana Alexievich, and encourages an on-
going dialogue with her and with other lead-
ers of the democratically-oriented political 
opposition in Belarus; 
(8) calls on the Government of Belarus to 
uphold its human rights obligations, includ-
ing those enumerated in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
(9) calls on the United States Government 
to impose targeted sanctions, in coordina-
tion with the European Union and other 
international partners, against officials in 
Belarus who are responsible for— 
(A) undermining democratic processes in 
Belarus; or 
(B) participating in human rights abuses 
related to political repression in Belarus; 
(10) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to continue working with its partners 
in Europe, particularly the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, to sup-
port the people of Belarus; and 
(11) supports— 
(A) the continued territorial integrity of 
Belarus; and

S. RES. 690 
Whereas investment in the education, 
training, and career advancement of the 
workforce in the United States, known as 
‘‘workforce development’’, is crucial to the 
ability of the United States to compete in 
the global economy; 
Whereas collaboration among Governors, 
local governments, State and local edu-
cation, workforce, and human services agen-
cies, community colleges, local businesses, 
employment service providers, community- 
based organizations, and workforce develop-
ment boards provides for long-term, sustain-
able, and successful workforce development 
across traditional sectors and emerging in-
dustries; 
Whereas middle-skill jobs, which require 
more than a high school diploma but not a 4- 
year degree, comprise 52 percent of the labor 
market, but only 42 percent of workers in 
the United States have been able to access

training at that level, creating a discrepancy 
that may limit growth in changing indus-
tries such as health care, manufacturing, 
and information technology; 
Whereas 76 percent of business leaders say 
greater investment in skills training would 
help their businesses; 
Whereas, during the first 6 months of 2020 
in the United States— 
(1) tens of millions of individuals filed for 
unemployment benefits; 
(2) more than 50 percent of job losses were 
concentrated among workers earning less 
than $40,000 per year; and 
(3) workers with a high school diploma or 
a lower level of educational attainment were 
displaced from jobs at nearly 3 times the 
rate of workers with a bachelor’s degree; 
Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
(29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) with overwhelming bi-
partisan support in recognition of the need 
to strengthen the focus of the United States 
on the skills necessary to fill jobs in local 
and regional industries; 
Whereas the Workforce Innovation and Op-
portunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) supports 
employment, training, and support services 
for individuals with barriers to employment, 
including— 
(1) individuals who are low-income; 
(2) individuals who are out of work, includ-
ing the long-term unemployed; 
(3) individuals displaced by outsourcing; 
(4) individuals living in rural areas or areas 
with persistently high unemployment; 
(5) individuals looking to learn new skills; 
and 
(6) individuals with disabilities; 
Whereas the more than 550 workforce de-
velopment boards and 2,500 American Job 
Centers are a driving force behind growing 
regional economies by providing training, re-
sources, and assistance to workers who aim 
to compete in the 21st century economy; 
Whereas ongoing State and local imple-
mentation of the Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) pro-
vides unprecedented opportunities to develop 
the skills of workers in the United States 
through access to effective workforce edu-
cation and training, including the develop-
ment and delivery of proven strategies such 
as sector partnerships, career pathways, in-
tegrated education and training, work-based 
learning models, and paid internships; 
Whereas, in 2018, programs authorized 
under the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.)— 
(1) served nearly 6,000,000 young people and 
adults; 
(2) exceeded employment targets across all 
programs; and 
(3) helped more than 1,500,000 individuals, 
including English language learners, gain 
skills and credentials to help the individuals 
succeed in the labor market; 
Whereas State programs established under 
the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et 
seq.)— 
(1) ensured that more than 5,400,000 unem-
ployed workers, including more than 500,000 
veterans, had access to career services 
through American Job Centers in 2018; and 
(2) are a foundational part of the workforce 
development system; 
Whereas workforce development programs 
will play a critical role in addressing the ex-
pected 2,400,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs 
over the next decade; 
Whereas community colleges and other 
workforce development training providers 
across the United States are well situated— 
(1) to train the next generation of workers 
in the United States; and 
(2) to address the educational challenges 
created by emerging industries and techno-
logical advancements; 
Whereas participation in a career and tech-
nical education (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘CTE’’) program decreases the risk of stu-
dents dropping out of high school, and all 50 
States and the District of Columbia report 
higher graduation rates for CTE students, as 
compared to other students; 
Whereas community and technical colleges 
operate as open access institutions serving 
millions of students annually at a compara-
tively low cost; 
Whereas the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century 
Act (Public Law 115–224; 132 Stat. 1563) sup-
ports the development and implementation 
of high-quality CTE programs that— 
(1) combine rigorous academic content 
with occupational skills; and 
(2) served approximately 12,500,000 high 
school and college students between 2018 and 
2019; 
Whereas there are more than 500,000 reg-
istered apprentices in the United States, and 
there is growing and bipartisan support for 
expanding earn-and-learn strategies to help 
current and future workers gain skills and 
work experience; 
Whereas the federally supported workforce 
system and partner programs— 
(1) have helped rebuild the economy of the 
United States and provide increased eco-
nomic opportunities; and 
(2) provide a pathway into 21st century 
jobs that support families while ensuring 
that businesses in the United States find the 
skilled workforce needed to compete in the 
global economy; and 
Whereas workforce development is crucial 
to sustaining economic security for workers 
in the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Workforce Development Month’’; 
(2) supports Federal initiatives to promote 
workforce development; and 
(3) acknowledges that workforce develop-
ment plays a crucial role in supporting 
workers and growing the economy.

DEMIC 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. 
DURBIN, Ms. HASSAN, and Mr. KING) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 691 
Whereas a positive school culture is impor-
tant for students, teachers, and staff to feel 
safe, valued, engaged, included, and re-
spected; 
Whereas students face intense academic 
and social pressures in school, including 
stress, bullying, and social isolation; 
Whereas students face increasing anxiety 
as the COVID–19 pandemic continues, as a re-
sult of— 
(1) social distancing requirements and in-
creasing social isolation; 
(2) fear of illness for themselves and peers; 
(3) uncertainty of the future for themselves 
and schooling; and 
(4) financial insecurity that results in hun-
ger or stress at home; 
Whereas, when these concerns or childhood 
trauma are not addressed appropriately, anx-
iety, depression, social withdrawal, disrup-
tive behavior, drug and alcohol abuse, and 
violence can result; 
Whereas skills developed through social 
and emotional learning equip young people 
to handle the challenges they face and help 
them succeed not just as students, but as 
healthy and caring adults, productive work-
ers, and engaged citizens; 
Whereas social and emotional learning is 
defined as the process through which chil-
dren and adults acquire and effectively apply 
the knowledge, attitudes, and skills associ-
ated with social and emotional competency, 
including the ability to— 
(1) identify, understand, and manage emo-
tions; 
(2) set and achieve positive goals; 
(3) feel and show empathy for others; 
(4) establish and maintain positive rela-
tionships; and 
(5) make responsible decisions; 
Whereas social and emotional learning pro-
grams can be effectively integrated into 
schools through classroom instruction, both 
in-person 
and 
virtually, 
and 
other 
schoolwide activities that— 
(1) provide instruction for school leaders, 
educators, and staff on social and emotional 
learning, so they can both model these skills 
for students and benefit from them person-
ally and professionally; 
(2) integrate social and emotional learning 
through family engagement and in the 
school curriculum, through instruction and, 
in some cases, playful learning; 
(3) provide systematic instruction in which 
skills are taught, modeled, practiced, and ap-
plied in daily behavior; and 
(4) establish safe and caring learning envi-
ronments that foster student participation, 
engagement, and connection to their school 
community; 
Whereas social and emotional skills are 
both teachable and measurable, and evi-
dence-based social and emotional learning 
programs have already been successfully im-
plemented in schools across the country for 
students in preschool through high school; 
Whereas students exposed to social and 
emotional learning programs have improved 
academic outcomes, including greater moti-
vation to learn and commitment to school, 
increased time devoted to schoolwork and 
mastery of subject matter, and improved at-
tendance, graduation rates, grades, and test 
scores; 
Whereas these positive outcomes increase 
in students who are involved in social and 
emotional learning programs by an average 
of 11 percentage points over students who are 
not involved in such programs; 
Whereas social and emotional learning pro-
grams can mitigate the impact of childhood 
trauma and also result in reduced problem 
behavior, improved health outcomes, a lower 
rate of violent delinquency, and a lower rate 
of heavy alcohol use; 
Whereas programs that increase student 
connectedness and raise awareness about so-
cial isolation have been shown to reduce bul-
lying and improve school climate; and 
Whereas social and emotional learning pro-
grams help young people appreciate the im-
portance of developing and sustaining posi-
tive interpersonal relationships and inclu-
sive communities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of evidence-based so-
cial and emotional learning programs; 
(2) encourages schools and communities to 
implement programs to facilitate social and 
emotional learning in both in-person cur-
riculum and virtual curriculum; and 
(3) encourages schools to conduct regular 
in-person and virtual training of their staff 
to ensure social and emotional learning pro-
grams can evolve, grow, and build capacity 
as needed.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF MASTER SERGEANT CHRIS-
TINE INCH, 193RD SPECIAL OPER-
ATIONS 
WING, 
PENNSYLVANIA 
AIR NATIONAL GUARD 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to congratulate Master Sergeant (MSgt) Chris-
tine Inch on her well-earned retirement after 
23 years of service to our communities, Com-
monwealth and Country while serving in the 
193rd Special Operations Wing, Pennsylvania 
Air National Guard. 
Following the heinous and cowardly attacks 
of 9/11, MSgt Inch served as the Wing Com-
mand 
Staff 
Orderly. 
She 
ensured 
that 
(amongst myriad other duties), before boots or 
bombs hit the ground in Afghanistan, Air-
men—and all United States Service Mem-
bers’—only 
flying/psychological 
operations/ 
broadcasting platform was already over target 
delivering messages of freedom. 
MSgt Inch was instrumental to the mission 
assurance 
and 
success 
for 
over 
350 
Warfighters in five distinct squadrons. She led 
the standup of the consolidated Group Com-
mander Support Staff as it transitioned from 
the squadrons to administration at the Group 
level. Her direct efforts seamlessly realigned 
positions and duties to better accommodate 
critical commander support actions throughout 
193rd Special Operations Mission Support 
Group units. 
MSgt Inch’s adaptability and affability en-
abled her to provide leadership as needed, as 
a critical embedded member during myriad 
time periods within many Squadrons, and 
helped ensure thousands of this unique unit’s 
Air Commandos to arrive on time, on target 
and back home into the loving arms of their 
families and friends. 
In addition to her varied duties and respon-
sibilities, MSgt Inch volunteered as the sole 
administrative support lead during Operation 
IRON RESPONSE, providing critical security 
for the 2015 Papal Visit in Philadelphia. In this 
position, she facilitated essential personnel 
data and information-sharing among joint part-
ners, which lead to mission success. 
MSgt Inch’s dedication and tireless efforts, 
as well as her administrative subject matter 
expertise contributed to the 193rd Special Op-
erations Communications Squadron earning 
the U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Harold 
W. Grant Award as the best small communica-
tions unit in the Air National Guard. 
MSgt Inch leaves a ‘‘can-do’’ Airman legacy. 
Her performance and professionalism was ex-
ceptional, as she consistently delivered accu-
rate and timely information—eclipsed only by 
her positive and radiant attitude. Master Ser-
geant Christine Inch’s distinguished career 
and selfless service to our Nation reflect great 
credit upon herself, the Air National Guard, the 
United States Air Force, and the United States 
of America.

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize attorney Allan M. Kluger, 
whose career was celebrated by the Friedman 
Jewish Community Center at their first annual 
Tribute Gala on Sunday, September 13, 2020. 
A native of Northeastern Pennsylvania, 
Allan graduated from Wyoming Seminary Pre-
paratory School in 1945. After receiving his 
undergraduate degree in 1949 from Amherst 
College in Massachusetts, he attended law 
school at the University of Pennsylvania. 
In 1952, Allan began his legal career with 
the firm Hourigan, Kluger, and Quinn, special-
izing in business law, estate planning and ad-
ministration, wills, trusts, and real estate law. 
During his near seven-decade career, he es-
tablished himself as a leading attorney in the 
region and rose through the ranks to president 
and senior member of Hourigan, Kluger, and 
Quinn. Allan is a member of the Luzerne 
County and American Bar Associations and 
was appointed by the governor to serve on the 
Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission from 
1991 to 1998. In recognition of his skill and 
commitment to the field, he was named a 
Pennsylvania Super Lawyer in 2004 and 2005. 
In addition to his professional pursuits, Allan 
is dedicated to giving back to his community. 
He has served on the boards of and in leader-
ship positions for over 25 organizations, in-
cluding the Jewish Community Center, the 
Luzerne County Bar Association, and the F.M. 
Kirby Center for Performing Arts. He is cur-
rently a Trustee Emeritus of King’s College, 
Director Emeritus of the Greater Wilkes-Barre 
Chamber of Business and Industry, Director 
and Secretary of Luzerne Foundation/Found-
ing Board, and Director of Luzerne Products, 
Inc. 
Allan has been lauded for his service to oth-
ers. In addition to being recognized by the 
Friedman Jewish Community Center, he has 
received the Mary Bevevino Community Serv-
ice Award; the Father James Lackenmier, 
C.S.C. Award for Achievement and Leader-
ship; the B’nai B’rith Outstanding Citizen 
Award; the First Annual Ethics Award from the 
Ethics Institute of Northeastern Pennsylvania; 
the Wyoming Seminary Distinguished Service 
Award; the President’s Award from the 
Luzerne County Bar Association; the Boy 
Scouts Distinguished Citizen Award; the Life-
time Achievement in Philanthropy Award with 
his wife, Sue from the Greater Pocono North-
east Chapter of the National Society of Fund-
raising 
Executives; 
the 
Anti-Defamation 
League 
Distinguished 
Community 
Service 
Award; the Pillar of the Community Award 
from Temple Israel; and the Greater Wilkes- 
Barre Chamber of Commerce Distinguished 
Citizen Award. 
It is an honor to recognize a true community 
leader and former colleague in the legal pro-
fession. Allan’s career and life have been 
marked by integrity and a willingness to go the 
extra mile for his community, and I wish him 
many more years of health and happiness 
ahead.

LUTION 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Constitution Week 
and the Theodosia Burr Chapter of the Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution in Myrtle 
Beach, South Carolina. 
It is a privilege and duty of the American 
people to commemorate the two hundred thir-
ty-third anniversary of the drafting of the Con-
stitution of the United States of America by the 
Constitutional Convention. As citizens of this 
great nation, we must reaffirm the ideals the 
Framers of the Constitution had in 1787. 
Public Law 915 guarantees the issuing of a 
proclamation each year by the President of 
the United States of America designating Sep-
tember 17 through 23 as Constitution Week. It 
is fitting and proper to officially recognize this 
magnificent document and the anniversary of 
its creation. 
Madam Speaker, I join the Theodosia Burr 
Chapter of the Daughters of the American 
Revolution and the American people in recog-
nizing September 17 through September 23, 
2020 as Constitution Week and honor the 
Framers for their contributions.

on maximization of economic resources and 
development 
for 
distressed 
communities. 
Some of his domestic projects include the es-
tablishment of a certified Community Develop-
ment Financial Institution (CDFI) and assisting 
in establishing a credit union in Fresno, Cali-
fornia. Other international projects include the 
consortium of the UNOCAL gas pipeline 
project, Petro chemical project and a construc-
tion project in Singapore. 
Salam has expanded his experience and 
network internationally as he served as a 
County Head of Finance for a multi-national 
company, established international joint ven-
tures, participated in the development of a 
$2.5 billion eight-country gas pipeline consor-
tium and other projects related to construction, 
petrochemicals and textiles. He traveled to 
many countries around the globe, including 
Western and Eastern Europe, Thailand, Dubai, 
and Romania. He was invited and recognized 
by the Romanian government to be the na-
tion’s Honorary Consul General. 
His leadership in the community has made 
a significant impact. Salam has been involved 
within the community by serving on boards of 
several organizations, such as the Fresno 
Metropolitan Museum, Fresno Arts Museum, 
Citizens Foundation USA, Central Valley Cen-
ter for the Blind, and other organizations. For 
the past 27 years, he has worked for the Fres-
no Economic Opportunities Commission. He 
has served as the Chief Financial Officer and 
an effective leader managing the fiscal affairs 
within the nonprofit business. As CEO of the 
Fresno CDFI, he has successfully led the ex-
pansion of the operations and help commu-
nities develop infrastructure and enhance job 
potential. Without a doubt, Salam has made a 
significant impact to progress the economic 
and human prosperity within the Central Val-
ley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the retirement 
of Mr. Salam Nalia. I wish Salam and his fam-
ily continued success, health and happiness in 
this new chapter of his life.

HONORING FATHER LEWIS BROWN, 
FORMER 
MILITARY 
CHAPLAIN 
AND PAROCHIAL VICAR OF ALL 
SAINTS 
PARISH 
IN 
CORNING, 
NEW YORK 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Father Lewis Brown, former military 
chaplain and parochial vicar of All Saints Par-
ish in Corning, New York. Father Brown 
passed away on September 5, 2020, and it is 
only fitting to remember him thusly today. 
Father Brown, known as Father Lew to 
many, was a native of Elmira who attended 
Saint Mary’s Southside Parish. He would go 
on to serve as the assistant pastor of the 
Church of the Assumption in Fairport; Saint 
Alphonsus in Auburn and Saint Ann of Hornell. 
He also served as an assistant at Immaculate 
Conception in Ithaca. 
Father Brown served twenty-two years as a 
United States Navy Chaplain, serving in Oki-
nawa, Japan; the USS Nimitz, Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery and a recruitment base in 
Chicago. In 2007, he retired and returned to 
the Southern Tier, making his home in the 
Corning area. In 2008, Father Brown became 
the parochial vicar of my family’s church, All 
Saints Parish. 
I have always been inspired by the kindness 
and peace that Father Brown exuded. I appre-
ciated his military service as a chaplain and 
the deep dedication he had to the Church, es-
pecially All Saints Parish. He was almost al-
ways present at our Valentines for Vets 
events, where we shared special cards with 
veterans at the Bath VA Medical Center. I will 
always remember him fondly, as I am sure so 
many across the Corning area, the state and 
the nation will as well. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
honor Father Lewis Brown, former military 
chaplain and parochial vicar of All Saints Par-
ish in Corning, NY.

RECOGNITION OF KAROLE HONAS 
SERVICE TO IDAHO AGRICULTURE 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate my friend Karole Honas on a 
well-earned retirement after an extraordinary 
broadcasting career. 
Karole grew up in Gooding, Idaho and grad-
uated from the University of Idaho with a de-
gree in radio-TV, communications. Shortly 
after graduation she married her husband, 
Ken. They have been happily married for 40 
years. 
Karole started her career at KPVI in Poca-
tello. After 7 years, she left KPVI to raise her 
three sons. In 1990, Jay Hildebrandt called 
and asked her to fill in as an anchor for six 
weeks while another anchor was on maternity 
leave. Those six weeks turned into 30 years of 
co-anchoring with Jay Hildebrandt. Together 
they were an iconic news team that the com-
munity trusted. 
In addition to her role at KIFI with Jay, 
Karole mentored new journalists who were 
getting started in the industry. She also spent 
14 years as an adjunct instructor at Idaho 
State University. She has served as a member 
of the advisory board for the School of Jour-
nalism and Mass Media in the College of Let-
ters, Arts and Social Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Idaho. She continues to reach out to 
students interested in television news, inform-
ing of internship opportunities and job open-
ings at her station and elsewhere. 
Karole has served on several community 
boards and committees. As an active member 
of her community, Karole is committed to leav-
ing this area better than she found it. 
It has been my privilege to be interviewed 
by Karole throughout my political career. Even 
though we were friends she didn’t hold back 
the tough questions. I have always appre-
ciated her honesty and fairness. 
Madam Speaker, Karole Honas has pro-
vided an immeasurable service to Eastern 
Idaho for the last 30 years. I want to thank her 
for that service and wish her well in a well- 
earned retirement. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF VINCENT 
‘‘VIC’’ SHUTTERA 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a great marine, Vincent ‘‘Vic’’ 
Shuttera who passed away July 30, 2020. Vin-
cent served in the Marine Corps at the first of-
fensive land battle of Guadalcanal and contin-
ued his service in the Central Valley. He was 
a veteran, an honorable friend, a father, and 
a patriot in the community. 
VIncent was born on April 11, 1918 in 
Stanislaus County to Frank and Hannah 
Shuttera. After graduating high school, Vincent 
was selected for the first group of young men 
to take part in the Boys State program’s inau-
gural year. After a few years of college, Vin-
cent joined the military—a decision that would 
change his life. 
In 1943, Vincent joined the Marine Corps 
and became a driver of a tank destroyer with 
a .75 mm gun. He later joined the pistol range 
and became one of the top marksmen in his 
unit. 
Vincent was stationed in San Diego, then 
moved to Oceanside’s Camp Pendleton. The 
unit was then transported to the island of Gua-
dalcanal. To support the regimental and head-
quarters companies. Vincent served there for 
six months. From his view on the island, he 
witnessed the sinking of more than 50 war 
ships in Navy battles. 
After his duty in Guadalcanal, Vincent was 
ordered to New Zealand where he contracted 
malaria. He returned to the United States on 
July 3, 1943 still in poor health from malaria. 
He spent nearly a year in Oak Knoll hospital 
in Santa Cruz, California. Vincent would finish 
his service with the Marine Corps with an hon-
orable 
discharge 
as 
Corporal 
Vincent 
Shuttera. 
After serving in World War II, Vincent start-
ed a family, moved to Modesto, California and 
started a truck driving business, where he 
worked with large equipment like tractors, 
scrapers, and bulldozers on farmland. 
Vincent dedicated his life to his fellow vet-
erans and telling stories about his experiences 
in World War II. He was the guest speaker for 
Boys State, was on the Central Valley Honor 
Flight, in the Marine Corps League, American 
Legion Post 4, in the Central Valley Veterans 
Day Parade, and more. 
Vincent is survived by his sons, Steve and 
Mark 
Shuttera, 
and 
his 
daughter 
Vicki 
Essman. 
Grandchildren 
Michelle 
Launier, 
Sacbe Shuttera, Brian Day, Brandi Shuttera, 
Charlie Shuttera, and his great-grandchildren 
Matthew 
Silva, 
Audrey 
Shuttera, 
Gavin 
Launier, Autumn Day, Ahren Shuttera, Luke 
Launier, and Jacob Day. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the life of Mr. 
Vincent Shuttera. His advocacy and service to 
his country will be remembered for many 
years to come. We join his family, friends and 
community in honoring his great life and leg-
acy.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL HARRY V. SHOOP 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the late LTC Harry Shoop who 
passed away on August 19, at the age of 99. 
LTC Shoop joined the Army in 1940, serving 
in Ohio’s 37th and 38th Infantry Divisions. 
He demonstrated integrity and valor in the 
Pacific during World War II, serving as platoon 
sergeant for Company B and Company H of 
the 149th Infantry Regiment. I was proud to 
present him with his Purple Heart at a 2017 
ceremony, when he was also awarded his 
long overdue Bronze Star and World War II 
Service Medal. 
I am eternally grateful for LTC Shoop for his 
outstanding 31-year military career. I also 
thank him for his lifelong commitment to serv-
ing the people of Ohio and this great nation. 
I pray that God will bring comfort to LTC 
Shoop’s family and friends, and all those in 
the community grieving his loss. 
May God bless them.

CONGRATULATING 
HANNAH 
STRAIN AS A WINNER OF THE 
2018 
FFA 
NATIONAL 
AGRI-
CULTURE PROFICIENCY AWARD 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Hannah Strain of 
Rolla, Missouri for being selected as a winner 
of the 2018 National Agricultural Proficiency 
Award for her Supervised Agricultural Experi-
ence (SAE) project at the 91st National FFA 
Convention & Expo. 
The SAE project is one that every FFA 
member completes, compelling them to apply 
what they are learning in the classroom while 
gaining hands-on career experience as an ag-
ricultural entrepreneur. Out of the 600,000- 
plus FFA members nationwide, Hannah is one 
of 188 national finalists who will be competing 
this month in Indianapolis. This is an enor-
mous accomplishment for Hannah and a his-
torical milestone for the Rolla FFA chapter. 
Hannah started a hay business in conjunc-
tion with her family’s beef ranch, Elk Prairie 
Farms LLC, where she manages grazing for 
the cattle and produces and sells hay to local 
farmers and ranchers. She won the local, 
area, and state proficiency award contests, 
propelling her to the national convention. Han-
nah excelled at this project because of her 
knowledge and ability in growing, managing, 
marketing and selling hay. 
Hannah has since moved on to the Univer-
sity of Missouri, where she is studying Agricul-
tural Education and Leadership, hoping to 
work in community outreach for an agri-
business. It is my great privilege to congratu-
late Hannah Strain before the United States 
House of Representatives on her remarkable 
achievement. 
HONORING THE STATE ACCREDI-
TATION OF MADERA COMMUNITY 
COLLEGE CENTER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the state accreditation of Madera 
Community College, which becomes the 116th 
campus of the state’s community college sys-
tem. It is the newest college in California. 
In 1958, State Center Community College 
District began offering classes at Madera High 
School with 158 students enrolled in 19 
evening classes. In 1989, the Madera Com-
munity College Center was then relocated and 
established in a portable building at James 
Madison Elementary School. 
Throughout the years, the institution has 
grown and expanded by establishing buildings, 
laboratories, food services, large instruction 
classrooms, vocational training courses, certifi-
cations and offering more than 360 courses. In 
fall 2009, the Center for Advanced Manufac-
turing (CAM) was established to offer me-
chanic and welding programs. Recently, the 
college added the Center for Agriculture and 
Technology (CAT) which provides laboratory, 
vocational training programs and various agri-
culture programs in plant science, agriculture 
mechanics, industrial maintenance and weld-
ing. 
Because of the leadership of then Chan-
cellor Dr. Bill F. Stewart and Vice Chancellor 
of External Relations Dr. Tom Crow, a dona-
tion of 114 acres was made by local land-
owners to establish the expanded current 
campus. Today, Madera Community College 
Center serves more than 6,123 students, with 
comprehensive and innovative programs in 
transfer/general education, occupational edu-
cation, distance learning courses, online learn-
ing and developmental education. The Center 
continues to provide an affordable, quality 
education for the residents of Madera County 
and nearby communities in the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing this historical moment and 
the success of the Madera Community Col-
lege. This could not have been possible with-
out the dedication and contributions of their 
staff, faculty, administrators and community 
leaders. I look forward to seeing the future 
achievements and success of our students, 
the leaders of tomorrow.

GENE BUDIG 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of Dr. Gene Budig of 
lsle of Palms, South Carolina. Gene was 
raised in the small town of McCook, Nebraska 
where his love of baseball began at age 12. 
He wrote to then St. Louis Browns owner, Bill 
Veeck, asking for a tryout and received a let-
ter back informing Gene that he could have a 
tryout under the stipulations that he graduate 
high school. This formative moment taught 
Gene that with a little audacity and a lot of 
hard work, achieving his dreams was possible. 
In his 81 years, Gene served in countless 
leadership positions across the country, from 
Major General in the Air National Guard; Uni-
versity President at lllinois State, West Virginia 
and Kansas; and a newspaper executive and 
author, just to name a few. Despite his lengthy 
educational career, anyone who knew Gene 
knew his deep passion for baseball and that 
he wore his love for the game, and the Yan-
kees, on his sleeve. Gene was the last Presi-
dent of the American League, where he cele-
brated diversity and hired Larry Doby, the first 
Black player in the American League, as an 
assistant. The Charleston RiverDogs brought 
Gene back to his childhood barter with Bill 
Veeck, but this time, he was shaking hands 
with his son, Mike Veeck. In the 14 years that 
Gene served as co-owner, it was clear how 
much the franchise loved Gene. We will all 
miss his kind presence. 
Gene is survived by Gretchen, his wife of 57 
years, his three children, and his siblings. The 
Lowcountry mourns this loss but will remem-
ber Gene for the life he lived as a loving fa-
ther, a leader full of wit and integrity, and an 
avid fan of all things baseball.

TRIBUTE TO MARC AARONS 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an individual 
whose dedication and contributions to South-
ern California are exceptional. Today, I ask 
the House of Representatives to join me in 
congratulating Marc Aarons on his year as the 
District Governor of Rotary District 5320. 
Marc’s Rotary career began in 1997, and 
since then his involvement in the organization 
has been expansive. Today, he is a member 
of the Rotary Club of Newport Balboa and has 
been recognized with several awards, includ-
ing the Cliff Docterman Award, for his dedica-
tion to the organization. Throughout his years 
of service, Marc has served as the Rotary 
Club of Newport Balboa’s Treasurer, Voca-
tional Chair, VP Ethics, International Chair, 
and Immediate Past President. 
His service goes beyond Newport Balboa as 
Marc has served Southern California as Ro-
tary District 5320’s District Governor for the 
2019–2020 year. Previously, he was an As-
sistant District Governor from 2013–2015 and 
a member of the District’s Advisory Board 
from 2015 to 2017. Marc has also served as 
a member of the Foundation Committee, the 
Training Committee, and the Membership 
Committee. 
A proud Eagle Scout, Marc’s character and 
dedication to service have been largely influ-
enced by his involvement with the Boy Scouts 
of America. He has received awards and rec-
ognition for his service to the Scouts around 
the world, including in Sweden, South Africa, 
and Germany. He also served as the Boy 
Scout’s International Committee Chairman for 
Orange County. 
Marc is a Certified Senior Advisor who has 
extensively studied the financial, physical, 
emotional, and personal issues affecting to-
day’s business owners. After living in Japan,

HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK 
WOOLF 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
along with my colleague Mr. COX to honor the 
life of a great farmer, veteran and San Joa-
quin Valley native, Jack Woolf, who passed 
away on July 28, 2020 at the age of 102. Jack 
was a pioneering farmer who transformed the 
west side of California’s San Joaquin Valley 
into an agricultural oasis. 
Jack was born on Sept. 6, 1917, along with 
his identical twin, Leyton, in Scottsdale, Ari-
zona. Growing up, he enjoyed helping his fam-
ily at their small dairy farm. After graduating 
from Peoria High School in 1935, he and his 
twin moved to Los Angeles and enrolled in 
Woodbury Business College. They obtained 
their business degrees in two years and grad-
uated Magna Cum Laude. 
After college, Jack worked as a cotton mer-
chandiser, but due to escalating tensions in 
Europe, Jack registered for the draft in early 
spring 1941. He joined the Army and rose to 
the rank as Captain. As a member of the 
204th Anti-Aircraft Battalion, he landed on 
Omaha Beach as part of the D-Day Normandy 
Invasion of Europe. He received seven battle 
stars. He was discharged as a Major in De-
cember 1945. 
After a career of military service, he re-
turned to his old job at Anderson Clayton. In 
1957, he traveled to Mendota. Calif. to meet 
with a landowner, Russell Giffen who sold his 
farming operation to Anderson Clayton. This 
created a 30 plus year relationship that led to 
creating one of California’s largest and most 
successful farming operation, Giffen Inc. 
In 1949, Jack met his soul mate, Bernice. A 
few months after they met, they decided to get 
married and formed a beautiful family. In 
1974, Giffen retired from the farming business 
and asked Jack to sell all the assets. Instead. 
Jack decided to start his own operation, Woolf 
Farming Co. of California. 
Jack proved to be a leader and successful 
entrepreneur. His business grew successfully 
because of vision. loyalty. and passion. His 
military training and strong character were in-
grained into who he was as a businessman 
and member of the community. 
Jack was a member of several boards and 
organizations including The National Cotton 
Council. Valley Public Television, Fresno His-
torical Society, Santa Clara University Board 
of Regents and the California Tomato Growers 
Association. He helped establish a graduate 
agribusiness program at Santa Clara Univer-
sity and he received an honorary doctorate 
degree from Fresno State. Both of these insti-
tutions offer scholarships in his honor. 
He is survived by his loving and devoted 
wife of over 70 years, Bernice, his six kids: 
Anne Franson and husband Don, Nancy 
Woolf, John Woolf and wife Mary Pat, Mike 
Woolf and wife Shelly, Stuart Woolf and wife 
Lisa, Chris Woolf and wife Sarah, 24 grand-
children and 4 great-grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
us in celebrating and honoring the life of Mr. 
Jack Woolf. Jack strode through life with pur-
poseful steady steps, a man on his way some-
where, always moving forward. His service to 
his country will be remembered for many 
years to come. We join his family, friends and 
community in honoring his life and legacy.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHARLES 
AMBLER’S RETIREMENT 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Charles Ambler on the 
occasion of his retirement from the University 
of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). UTEP bids good-
bye to one of its most notable contributors to 
the institution’s transformation from a regional 
university to a leader in U.S. higher education. 
Dr. Ambler joined the UTEP faculty in 1984. 
As a recent Ph.D. graduate of Yale, he de-
voted himself to supporting UTEP’s mission of 
ensuring the success of its majority Hispanic 
and first-generation student body. Concur-
rently, Dr. Ambler established himself as an 
internationally recognized scholar of African 
History, publishing numerous articles and 
scholarly books focused on 19th and 20th 
century Africa. 
Dr. Ambler quickly rose through the faculty 
ranks earning the title of Professor and serv-
ing as Chair of UTEP’s History Department. In 
1996, Dr. Ambler assumed leadership of 
UTEP’s emerging graduate program, a role he 
played on and off as Dean and Assistant Vice 
President until 2019. In the mid-nineties, 
UTEP was limited to a small number of doc-
toral programs. He recognized the opportunity 
at hand, created by lawsuits challenging the 
lack of graduate programs along the United 
States-Mexico border region, to greatly ex-
pand program offerings. UTEP was able to es-
tablish itself as a national leader in graduate 
education and a major producer of Hispanic 
doctoral 
degree 
holders. 
Altogether, 
Dr. 
Ambler understood it was important for these 
degree programs to not only be of the highest 
quality, but to focus on the scholarly issues 
happening along the border region. UTEP’s 
forward thinking led to the development of a 
doctoral degree program in U.S.-Mexico bor-
der history. This innovation was accompanied 
by similar degrees with a border focus in 
areas like International Business, Engineering, 
and Health Science. 
While Dr. Ambler was an internationally rec-
ognized African History scholar, he was deep-
ly committed to improving undergraduate edu-
cation. He regularly taught large sections of 
undergraduate history and developed strate-
gies to improve the success of UTEP’s stu-
dents. Dr. Ambler’s strategies and teaching 
skills included technology-based learning and 
contacting students who stopped attending 
class to invite them back. As a result, comple-
tion rates in his section and average scores 
on standardized tests were higher than in 
other sections of the same class. 
Dr. Ambler’s influence on education, grants, 
and studentship has gone far beyond UTEP. 
He has held several prestigious fellowships, 
served as President of the African Studies As-
sociation, and most recently served as Dean 
in Residence of the Council of Graduate 
schools. 
Dr. Ambler and his wife Gloria, who recently 
retired herself after many years of service as 
a teacher and counselor in the El Paso Inde-
pendent School District, are vital members of 
the El Paso community. 
UTEP is a better place due in no small part 
to Dr. Ambler’s 35 years of service.

HONORING JOSEPH W. HESTON 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Joseph W. Heston for his 45-year 
career in broadcast journalism, including more 
than 20 years on the central coast of Cali-
fornia, and congratulate him on his retirement. 
Joe’s early career began with Westinghouse 
Broadcasting in 1976 at WJZ-TV in Baltimore. 
Over the next eight years, Joseph held various 
production positions at WJZ-TV, WBZ-TV in 
Boston, and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh. In 1984, 
Joe began working with Hearst Television, 
where he would spend the rest of his career. 
He joined Hearst at WCVB-TV in Boston, 
where he was executive producer of program-
ming and assistant program director, before 
moving to WBAL-TV in Baltimore, where he 
was vice president and station manager, and 
WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh, where he also served 
as vice president and station manager. 
Joe’s career took him to the California in 
1999, where he began his role as president 
and general manager of KSBW-TV, the Heart 
Television station serving the Central Coast. 
His time at KSBW has been marked by a 
number 
of 
milestones. 
In 
2001, 
KSBW 
launched its official website, which now aver-
ages over 6 million pageviews a month with 
over 500,000 unique users and is the region’s 
most visited local site. In 2002, Joe oversaw 
the construction and launch of the market’s 
first HDTV station. In April 2011, Joe oversaw 
the launch of ‘‘Central Coast ABC’’—the first 
local ABC affiliate ever on the Central Coast. 
In April 2016, he helped launch KSBW’s sec-
ond channel, the Spanish-language network 
Estrella. During Joe’s time as president and 
general manager, KSBW has been recognized 
with Radio Television Digital News Association 
regional Edward R. Murrow Awards for Best 
Newscast and Breaking News, and regional 
Emmy Awards for Best Newscast and Best 
Breaking News Coverage. 
Throughout his time on the Central Coast, 
Joe has always had the priority of giving back 
to his community personally and through his 
work at KSBW. Joe is a former member of the 
Board of the United Way of Monterey County 
and oversaw KSBW’s launch of the early

childhood initiative ‘‘Success By 6’’ with the 
United Way of Santa Cruz County and Mon-
terey County to create opportunities for low-in-
come infants, toddlers, and young children to 
receive high-quality education. In 2005, he led 
the development of the teacher recognition 
project, the KSBW Crystal Apple Award, and 
in 2012, he led the implementation of KSBW’s 
Golden Whistle award for outstanding high 
school coaches. Heston is also a former mem-
ber of the Board of Trustees of York School 
and the Board of the Monterey County Re-
gional Health Development Group. Most re-
cently, after identifying the critical need due to 
the ongoing public health crisis, Joe led 
KSBW in raising more than $525,000 on be-
half of area food banks to aid COVID–19-dis-
tressed families throughout the Central Coast. 
Joseph W. Heston has tirelessly served the 
central coast of California by providing model 
leadership and essential quality programming. 
I wish Joe all the best as he enjoys his retire-
ment with his wife, Elizabeth Heston, and son, 
Joseph J. W. Heston. I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing his years of service and 
congratulating him on his retirement.

SUCCESS FOR SERBIA AND 
KOSOVO 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, earlier this month, President Donald 
J. Trump presided over the greatest diplomatic 
breakthrough in the Western Balkans in the 
last two decades. Indeed, for over twenty 
years, the potential of the Western Balkans re-
gion has been paralyzed due to the intractable 
conflict between the Republic of Serbia and 
the Republic of Kosovo. This bloody conflict 
took the lives of over 13,000 people and pre-
cipitated NATO intervention and bombardment 
at the turn of the 21st century. 
For over twenty years, a perpetual state of 
tension and distrust existed between Belgrade 
and Pristina. Ultimately, those that suffered 
most are Serbian and Kosovar families. I am 
grateful that under President Trump’s leader-
ship we have witnessed the first glimmers of 
hope and progress that will benefit Europe as 
a whole. On September 4, 2020, President 
Trump announced that the leaders of Serbia 
and Kosovo has agreed to enter into an 
agreement normalizing economic relations be-
tween the two nations. Serbain President 
Aleksander Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister 
Avdullah Hofi are courageous for peace and 
prosperity. President Trump is exactly right to 
say, ‘‘Economies can bring people together.’’ 
Mutual economic prosperity incentivized the 
creation of the European Union itself. By fo-
cusing on economic benefits and commercial 
ties first, these two erstwhile enemies can put 
aside thorny policy debates that have gotten 
them nowhere for decades and instead see 
the immediate dividends of peace. When both 
sides can prosper, unprecedented progress 
can be made on complicated issues. The 
ramifications of this agreement will reverberate 
far into the future and will reshape the course 
of history of the Western Balkans. 
Additionally, both Serbia and Kosovo also 
pledged to remove 5G equipment provided by 
untrusted vendors—namely China—from their 
mobile vendors and to prohibit all future bid-
ding by such vendors. This is also marks a 
major achievement in the Trump Administra-
tion’s foreign policy agenda to counter malign 
Chinese Communist Party influence around 
the world. 
This historic milestone comes amid a litany 
of Trump Administration foreign policy suc-
cesses—including successful peace agree-
ments brokered between Israel and the United 
Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Bahrain. 
Notably, on the day of the Serbia-Kosovo an-
nouncement, the White House also mentioned 
that Kosovo and Israel had agreed to nor-
malize ties and establish diplomatic relations, 
and that Serbia had agreed to move its em-
bassy to Jerusalem by July. 
Time and again, President Trump is proving 
to the world that real success can be achieved 
by implementing American leadership based 
on President Ronald Reagan’s maxim of 
Peace through Strength.

HONORING THE CAREER OF LIZ 
HARRISON 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 14, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Liz Harrison, on the occasion of her 
retirement from television news after 38 years 
on the air. Liz has been a familiar face and 
name with ABC 30 in the Fresno, California 
community. 
Born and raised in Baltimore, Liz attended 
the College of William and Mary in Williams-
burg, Virginia, before graduating from the Uni-
versity of Florida with a degree in Broad-
casting. Liz is married to Keith Allen, who 
works alongside her in the television news in-
dustry. 
Liz joined Fresno’s local ABC affiliate in 
1982, a time when women were underrep-
resented in the news industry. Throughout her 
career, Liz has served as co-anchor of Action 
News Live at 5 and at 11. She has covered 
nearly every type of news story and is proud 
to have given a voice to so many who’s sto-
ries needed to be told. In 2010, Liz and photo- 
journalist Richard Harmelink won an Emmy 
Award for excellence in reporting for their 
story on the U.S. military training for war in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Liz’s passion for her work led her to take on 
the intern coordinator position at the station, 
where she trained and mentored college stu-
dents as they pursued a career in television 
news. She has given her time to numerous or-
ganizations, including Mighty Moms Founda-
tion, the Art of Life Cancer Foundation, and 
the Fresno Rescue Mission. 
For 38 years, Liz dedicated her career to 
telling the stories of the San Joaquin Valley. 
She has left a lasting impact on our commu-
nity. Liz is dedicated to her family. She is the 
proud mom to five children and looks forward 
to spending more time with her grandchildren. 
She is also a breast cancer survivor and a 
role model. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in congratulating Liz 
Harrison on her career and retirement. I ask 
that you join me in wishing Liz continued suc-
cess as she begins her next chapter, as the 
owner of a leadership, coaching and teaching 
business.
