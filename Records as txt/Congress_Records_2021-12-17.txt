our hope for years to come. 
Give to the Members of this body a 
special 
measure

of both parties and their staff mem-

Angus S. King, Jr., Tim Kaine, Richard 
J. Durbin, Gary C. Peters, Tina Smith, 
Jack Reed, Martin Heinrich, Benjamin 
L. Cardin, Richard Blumenthal. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
nominations, in a few moments, we are 
going to begin confirming a slew of 
nominees to serve in the Biden admin-
istration that, up until now, have been 
needlessly obstructed by a handful— 
just a handful—of Senate Republicans. 
But under the rules, they can do that. 
Confirming these nominees is one of 
the most basic constitutional respon-
sibilities of the U.S. Senate. It is big-
ger than the interests of any one Sen-
ator. It is about ensuring our govern-
ment is able to effectively serve the 
American people here at home and ad-
vance the American interests overseas. 
For decades, both sides—both sides— 
have understood that each President, 
regardless of party, deserves to have 
their administration filled, and we 
have worked together to make that 
happen, particularly for noncontrover-
sial and less senior nominees. But to-
day’s blockade is a beast of a different 
nature. 
Right now, over 150—150—of Presi-
dent Biden’s nominees are stalled by a 
handful of Republican Senators who 
have hijacked the rules of the Senate 
for no other reason than obstruction 
for its own sake. Many received bipar-
tisan support in committee. 
These aren’t low-priority nominees— 
whatever that means. Many of these 
men and women would deal with mat-
ters of diplomacy and national secu-
rity. That is what Republicans are 
blocking. Some of them would help im-
plement the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. That is what Republicans are 
blocking. 
From fighting inflation to relieving 
supply chains, to advancing U.S. na-
tional security, many of the men and 
women who are nominated would be 
the ones who would actually do this 
work. Let me repeat that. For all the 
howling and hollering we hear from Re-
publicans about inflation, national se-
curity, and economic recovery, they 
are blocking the very same people 
whose jobs it would be to tackle these 
issues. It is ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ 
logic. 
There are no justifications for their 
delay—none. Listening to the other 
side twist themselves into pretzels, it 
is clear that their game is simple, cyn-
ical, self-interested obstruction. And I 
thank my colleagues on this side of the 
aisle for coming to the floor day after 
day to shine a spotlight on the real- 
world impact of Republicans’ obstruc-
tion. 
This is the consequence of Repub-
lican obstruction. We are going to keep 
voting in this Chamber as we work to 
get these nominees confirmed. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. President, now on Build Back 
Better, Senate Democrats are working 
to pass Build Back Better and send it 
to the President’s desk as soon as pos-
sible so we can strengthen the middle 
class, create opportunity in the 21st 
century, and fight the climate crisis. 
Yesterday, I had a good discussion 
with the President and the Speaker, 
where we talked about ongoing nego-
tiations on finalizing the Build Back 
Better Act so we can pass it through 
the Senate. The President requested 
more time to continue his negotia-
tions, and so we will keep working with 
him, hand in hand, to bring this bill 
over the finish line and deliver on these 
must needed provisions. 
At its core, Build Back Better is 
about making the greatest investment 
in the American people that we have 
seen in generations. It is about build-
ing new ladders to help people climb 
into the middle class and providing 
them stability to thrive in the middle 
class once they get there. That means 
lowering 
the 
costs 
of 
prescription 
drugs, extending the child tax credit, 
making childcare more affordable for 
tens of millions of families, expanding 
housing, early education, and afford-
able healthcare. And it means taking 
unprecedented steps to fight climate 
change and lay the groundwork for 
greater action in the future. 
These are all things that the Amer-
ican people want. These are things 
Democrats are fighting to secure. 
And it cannot be forgotten that not a 
single Republican—not one—has joined 
us in making them happen. They are 
opposed to making childcare more af-
fordable; they are opposed to fighting 
the climate crisis; and they are pos-
sibly even considering fighting provi-
sions like making drugs like insulin 
more affordable. 
If Republicans won’t fight to help ev-
eryday Americans afford the basics, 
Democrats will. We are going to keep 
working to achieve our goal of passing 
Build Back Better into law. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. President, on voting rights, the 
fight to protect voting rights and re-
store the U.S. Senate is moving for-
ward. 
Yesterday, I continued to have de-
tailed discussions with many of my col-
leagues about how we are going to 
reach our goal of passing voting rights 
to ensure it takes effect before Ameri-
cans return to the polls in the next 
election, so it can affect those 2022 
elections which Republican legislators 
are so jaundicing. 
Last night, a number of my col-
leagues and I met with Marty Paone, a 
Senate rules expert who worked under 
several previous majority leaders, in-
cluding Robert C. Byrd, about how we 
can restore the Senate so it can work 
the way our Founders intended, the 
way it has functioned for generations 
before the Republican gridlock of the 
past decade or so. 
Just now, I came from a meeting 
where both Marty Paone and Marty 
Gold—one a Democrat and one a Re-
publican—counseled discussing how we 
can move forward on these issues, mak-
ing the Senate work and getting voting 
rights done. 
Later today, Marty will join the Sen-
ate Democrats at our caucus meeting 
to continue this very important con-
versation—Marty Paone will. 
We have tried all year long to get Re-
publicans to join us on a bipartisan ef-
fort to protect our democracy, but they 
have resisted, and they have blocked 
the Senate from having so much as a 
debate on this issue—a debate, not 
even a debate. Four votes, on three of 
them, every Republican voted not even 
to go forward in debating them—on the 
fourth vote, only one. Of course, under 
the rules of the Senate, as they are 
presently constituted, you need 10. 
Voting rights should not be a par-
tisan issue. Both parties are better off 
if our democracy is strong and safe-
guarded against the Republican as-
saults playing out at the State level. 
The voting restrictions we are seeing 
passed in Republican-dominated State 
legislatures are the most egregious as-
saults on voting rights since the days 
of Jim Crow, and they are being passed 
entirely on a party-line basis—zero bi-
partisanship from these State legis-
lator Republicans. 
Here in the Senate, we are going to 
keep at it because just because Repub-
licans will not join us, does not mean 
Democrats will stop fighting on this 
issue. It is too important, and the fight 
continues. 
I yield the floor.

CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the

ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 49, the nays are 31. 
The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to express my support for a num-
ber of foreign affairs nominations that 
should receive not just cloture votes 
today but should receive votes on their 
nomination. 
It is a long list, including Dr. Atul 
Gawande to be the Assistant Adminis-
trator for the Bureau of Global Health 
at the U.S. Agency for International 
Development; Mark Gitenstein to be 
the U.S. Ambassador to the European 
Union; Julissa Reynoso Pantaleon to 
be the Ambassador to Spain; Rahm 
Emanuel to be the Ambassador to 
Japan; Governor Jack Markell to be 
the U.S. Representative to the Organi-
zation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development; Marcela Escobari to be 
Assistant 
Administrator 
for 
Latin 
America and the Caribbean at USAID; 
and Marc Knapper to be the Ambas-
sador to Vietnam. 
Just think about it. Think about 
these assignments. Think about these 
assignments and what they mean to 
the United States. These are quality 
nominees, people who will represent 
the United States at home and abroad 
with skill and dignity. 
I appreciate that the majority leader 
has made it a priority to confirm them 
prior to the end of the session, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port their nominations. But let’s face 
it—there is little to celebrate when it 
comes to nominations in the Senate. 
The truth is that some Republicans’ 
unprecedented 
obstructionism 
is 
straining the system to the breaking 
point, leaving the President without a 
team on national security positions 
that are critical to the national secu-
rity and interest of the United States 
and the American people, leaving our 
Nation weakened—weakened. I will 
talk a little bit about that as it relates 
to these nominees. 
I am thrilled that we are voting 
today on the nomination of Dr. Atul 
Gawande. His medical background and 
track record in public health are im-
pressive, and he is clearly superbly 
qualified for the role of Assistant Ad-
ministrator for the Bureau of Global 
Health at USAID. But it should not 
take this long. Dr. Gawande was nomi-
nated 5 months ago. 
We are in the middle of a pandemic, 
a global pandemic, and he will be key 
to helping us fight COVID internation-
ally. Do you think that our Republican 
colleagues would think it is urgent to 
get someone in a position that can help 
us to deal with the global COVID chal-
lenge? Republicans should have been 
pressuring us to move his nomination 
at lightning speed instead of slowing it 
at every turn. 
Similarly, I am pleased to support 
Ambassador Gitenstein to be our point 
person in Brussels. He has a long and 
distinguished career in both the public 
and private sectors, including pre-
viously as U.S. Ambassador to Roma-
nia, 
and 
is 
deeply 
committed 
to 
strengthening transatlantic ties. 
He should have been in Brussels 
weeks ago, as the President is working 
tirelessly to ensure a strong and uni-
fied European reaction if Russia dares 
to invade Ukraine. He has to do so 
without an Ambassador to the Euro-
pean Union. We want the European 
Union to be on our side and join with 
us in multilateral efforts to give Rus-
sia the consequences of any action 
militarily against Ukraine, but, you 
know, you need to have someone at the 
EU making the case. 
Marcela 
Escobari—her 
experience 
and knowledge are deeply needed at 
USAID, where she would be leading our 
efforts in Latin America and the Carib-
bean, regions that are facing immense 
challenges, from Haiti to Venezuela to 
the Northern Triangle. She was con-
firmed by voice vote for this very same 
position in 2016. Yet, this time around, 
her nomination has languished due to 
Republican holds. 
Now, we are worried about immigra-
tion, right, undocumented immigration 
coming to the country? Well, if you 
don’t have somebody to help create 
stability in Haiti, guess what. You are 
going to see a lot more people at that 
southern border. If we don’t deal with 
the Northern Triangle, we are going to 
continue to have a challenge. If we 
don’t deal with the humanitarian chal-
lenges of the dictatorship in Venezuela, 
we are going to continue to see a chal-
lenge there. Shouldn’t we have the per-
son in charge of dealing with these 
challenges so that we, in our national 
interest—forget about being a good 
neighbor—in our national interest, are 
protected? 
Look at the other nominees. Look at 
the other nominees. Spain. Spain hap-
pens to be the head right now—one of 
the Spaniards happens to be the head 
of the EU’s—basically their Secretary 
of 
State, 
their 
Foreign 
Minister. 
Wouldn’t it be great to have an Amer-
ican Ambassador in Spain pressing 
both the Spanish and that Foreign 
Minister on the questions of Ukraine, 
on the questions of Venezuela, on the 
questions of Cuba? And I could go on 
and on. But we have nobody in Spain. 
Spain hasn’t been the most forward- 
leading, as we would like to see them, 
even though they are involved heavily 
in our hemisphere, but we have no one 
in Spain to make the case. 
How about Japan? As we are trying 
to meet the challenge of China in that 
part of the world, we have no one in 
Japan to help galvanize the challenges 
that we want to meet as it relates to 
China—no one. We have a new Prime 
Minister in Japan. It would be great to 
have somebody on the ground already 
engaging with the Japanese in coordi-
nation with the QUAD as we deal with 
the challenges of China. I hear a lot of 
talk here about China, but here we are, 
when we could do something about it, 
and we have nothing. 
Marc Knapper to be the Ambassador 
to Vietnam—a country that is feeling 
the pressures and coercion of China 
economically and elsewise. Wouldn’t it 
be great to have a U.S. Ambassador 
there to help proselytize Vietnam into 
our orbit as they meet the challenges 
of China in the days ahead?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9276 
December 17, 2021 
So, supposedly, these people are 
being held up in pursuit of some na-
tional security initiative. Yet we are 
putting all these other national secu-
rity initiatives at risk in order to deal 
with one person’s vision of the world 
and what should be done. I don’t under-
stand that logic. I don’t know how, 
supposedly to promote the national in-
terests of the United States and its se-
curity, you then create a series of risks 
for the United States and its national 
security across the globe. That is what 
is happening. That is what is hap-
pening. It is pretty outrageous. 
Now, I am in pain here, but these 
nominations have to get done. They 
have to get done. So if we are going to 
stay here, we are going to stay here, 
but these nominations have to get 
done. These people need to be in their 
positions so that we are not going to be 
in pain across the globe. Something is 
going to happen in one of these places, 
and we will not be there to ultimately 
have someone to promote our interests 
to protect ourselves. 
Let me close by saying that I didn’t 
come to the Senate to fight about 
nominations—certainly not what I did 
when I aspired to come to the Senate. 
I don’t think most of our colleagues did 
as well. We came here to work for our 
constituents, to find solutions that 
move this country forward, to make a 
positive difference. We need to rededi-
cate ourselves to making the Senate 
work, to fulfilling the constitutional 
duty of advice and consent. We are not 
fulfilling our constitutional duty of ad-
vice and consent in this manner. 
Giving the President—I didn’t agree 
with President Trump on a lot of his 
foreign policy decisions, but I voted for 
a lot of his nominees, and I didn’t hold 
them up in any way, shape, or form, as 
we are seeing in this unprecedented 
fashion. He needs qualified people to 
help the Nation confront the chal-
lenges we face. 
I urge my colleagues, let’s move for-
ward. Let’s expeditiously get these 
nominees out. If you don’t want to vote 
for them, don’t vote for them. That is 
fine. But don’t stop the process of the 
advice and consent that ultimately is 
needed to put these people in the posi-
tions that are critical to the national 
security of the United States. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
TRIBUTE TO ROLFE MCCOLLISTER 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
would like to take a few minutes to 
talk about two prominent Louisianans 
who are either transitioning or have 
transitioned into new ways to serve 
our State. 
And I am not unbiased about these 
individuals, as you will shortly be able 
to tell. But I think most Louisianans 
who are fairminded will agree with 
what I am about to say. 
The first person I want to talk 
about—and I have known both of these 
folks 
for 
a 
long 
time—is 
Rolfe 
McCollister. 
Rolfe did own—he has sold a number 
of his companies. What did he do? Well, 
let me just say generally, first, Rolfe is 
a very astute and successful business 
person. He is one of the most promi-
nent, if not the most prominent, pub-
lisher in Louisiana. 
He started from scratch a periodical 
called the Baton Rouge Business Re-
port, and from that, Rolfe expanded. I 
mean, the list of his publications is 
very impressive. He started with the 
Baton Rouge Business Report. He pub-
lishes 10/12 Industry Report, 225 Maga-
zine, inRegister, Daily Report, 225 
Dine, Best of 225 This Week. 
He also started a very important tra-
dition, which is looked forward to in 
my State, called the Business Awards 
and Hall of Fame. 
He started the influential Women in 
Business, and he started the Top 40 
Under 40 list, to recognize some of our 
younger citizens. 
Rolfe is retiring effective at the first 
of the year, and despite all of Rolfe’s 
success in the business world—he is 
also a banker and he does other things, 
all self-made. Aside from his success in 
the world of publishing and journalism, 
the 
most 
important 
thing 
Rolfe 
McCollister has is his passion. 
Now, he is smart. He is very intel-
ligent, a graduate of LSU, extraor-
dinary character, very dependable. If 
you need something done, you go to 
Rolfe. Trustworthy. But it is his pas-
sion that has most impressed me about 
Rolfe McCollister. 
I first met Rolfe in 1987. I knew of 
him, but I met him. Louisiana had 
elected a brand-new reform Governor, a 
former Congressman by the name of 
Governor Buddy Roemer. 
Like many of our reform Governors, 
Buddy was to serve one term. And 
when Governor Roemer took over, 
gosh, the State was a mess. We had, I 
think it was, a $7 or $8 billion budget. 
We had a $1.1 billion structural deficit. 
When Governor Roemer became Gov-
ernor, we couldn’t make payroll. Our 
schools were a mess. We had no charter 
schools in Louisiana. Our universities 
were floundering. And when you don’t 
have adequate funding, universities 
tend to cannibalize each other. They 
were all competing for the dollars. It 
was like Lebanon; you didn’t know 
which faction was going to be the win-
ner today. 
Our campaign finance in Louisiana 
was a mess. At that time, it was legal, 
and not out of the ordinary, for some-
body to put $200,000 cash in a suitcase 
and take it to a political candidate, 
and it was perfectly legal for that can-
didate to take it and perfectly legal for 
that donor to give it. 
Governor Roemer set out to try to fix 
some of these problems, and by his side 
was Rolfe McCollister, not in a paid po-
sition. 
I was working for Governor Roemer 
then as his lawyer. Rolfe just spent all 
his time helping, and we needed him, 
because Governor Roemer would listen 
to him, and Rolfe was there every step 
of the way. 
And after Governor Roemer got beat, 
Rolfe didn’t stop. He has never stopped. 
He has been a leader in the charter 
school movement in Louisiana for as 
long as I can remember. He believes 
that competition makes all of us bet-
ter, and it will make our public schools 
better. 
He did a stint on the LSU board of 
supervisors, which runs our flagship 
university, LSU. Rolfe didn’t ever hold 
back. I mean, he said exactly what he 
thought about what was working at 
LSU and what wasn’t working, and 
Rolfe made a lot of people mad. 
But Rolfe always believed, as did 
Governor Roemer, and, frankly, as do 
I—I learned a lot from both of them— 
that if you make the right people mad, 
you are doing your job. And this was 
all because of his passion, because he 
cared so much about Louisiana, to 
make it better. He didn’t make any 
money off of it; it cost him money. And 
I am sure his family said: Hey, Rolfe, 
you know, can you come home a little 
earlier tonight, you know? 
But Rolfe is just a fine person, and I 
am very proud to have him in Lou-
isiana. When I count my blessings, I 
count 
Rolfe 
twice, 
and 
he 
is 
transitioning to a new role. He sold his 
company to his partner, who is another 
great guy, Julio Melara. But Rolfe is 
going to still be involved in my State, 
and I just want to thank him. 
TRIBUTE TO MELINDA DESLATTE 
Mr. President, the second person I 
want to mention briefly—totally dif-
ferent in terms of the way she contrib-
utes to our State—her name is Melinda 
Deslatte. 
Melinda is the new—I want to get her 
title right—research director, which is 
the No. 2 position at the Public Affairs 
Research Council. 
The Public Affairs Research Council 
is a big deal in Louisiana. I think it is 
our oldest think tank. It is one of the 
premier think tanks. They are not Re-
publicans; they are not Democrats. I 
don’t know what they are, except 
smart and straightforward. 
They periodically publish white pa-
pers, exhaustively researched, about 
issues like the environment, fiscal pol-
icy, education. Every year when we 
amend our constitution—and, unfortu-
nately, we amend our State constitu-
tion just about every year—PAR puts 
out a publication explaining—not advo-
cating for or against, but explaining— 
the amendments. I read their white pa-
pers and their writings like clockwork. 
The No. 2 position there is research 
director. So it is important. Melinda 
Deslatte is the new research director. I 
think Melinda has taken over the Pub-
lic Affairs Research Council, and I am 
bittersweet about it. I am very happy 
for PAR because they got one of our 
best and our brightest, but I am really 
sad for journalism. 
Melinda ran the Associated Press in 
Baton Rouge for 22 years—22 years. 
And, for me, the three things that you 
have to have to be a respected jour-
nalist are, first, you have got to have

brains. Melinda has brains aplenty. I 
am not saying she is the smartest per-
son I have ever met, but to paraphrase 
Coach Bum Phillips, the list she is on, 
it doesn’t take long to call the roll. 
You have got to be willing to work 
very hard to be a successful journalist, 
and, boy, Melinda has a work ethic. 
But you have also got to be fair, and 
Melinda Deslatte was—she is now at 
PAR—the fairest journalist I have ever 
dealt with. 
I don’t know what her politics are. I 
never asked her. I don’t even know if 
she is in a party. And I have been on 
the long end and the short end of some 
of her pieces. 
She was unspinnable. By that, I mean 
it is not that she wouldn’t listen. You 
could call Melinda. She was a great lis-
tener. You could sit there and talk to 
her and give her your speech for 20 
minutes, 30 minutes, and if she wasn’t 
on deadline, she would listen to you. 
But I always got the impression it 
didn’t do any good because she was so 
smart and so hard-working and so dedi-
cated to her profession that she was 
just going to call it like she saw it, and 
she did. She did. 
She was not an agenda journalist. 
She was a real journalist. And I know, 
you know, that Melinda is probably not 
going to like me saying this. Melinda is 
the kind of journalist that if a politi-
cian praised her, you know, it is like: I 
must be doing something wrong here. 
You know, you don’t want too much 
praise from politicians. 
But she has left her job. So I feel like 
I can do it. And she has gone on to an-
other way of helping our State. 
I wish all of our journalists were 
Melinda Deslatte. I wish all of them 
were Melinda Deslatte. 
But, 
anyway, 
thank 
you, 
Rolfe. 
Thank you, Melinda. Thank you both 
for giving so much to Louisiana. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I am looking around this Cham-
ber, and I am talking to my colleagues, 
and it is so apparent; we should not be 
here right now. Our business should be 
done. We have had all year. 
We should have wished one another 
well last week, and then we should 
have gotten ourselves home to our fam-
ilies, to our church families, to our 
neighbors and friends. And right now, I 
should be in Tennessee wishing Ten-
nesseans well for this Christmas sea-
son. 
But with the way things are going, I 
am beginning to believe that Joe Biden 
and the Democrats do not wish the 
American people well because the fact 
is, everything they have done this 
year, in some way, shape, or form, has 
made life harder for Americans and for 
Tennesseans, and it has taken away 
just a little bit more of their freedom. 
I was talking with a Tennessean last 
night, and they were making this point 
to me about the gains that they had 
seen during Republican control of the 
House and the Senate and the Trump 
administration and being able to keep 
more of their money in their pocket. 
This was a veteran who talked about 
our standing in the world. Our allies 
knew they could trust us. Our enemies, 
indeed, feared us. All of that is gone. 
Life is harder; life is more uncertain; it 
is less predictable; inflation is through 
the roof. 
As Tennesseans have turned on the 
news this week, they have heard an av-
alanche of news reports holding one or 
two Members of this body responsible 
for ‘‘obstructing the democratic proc-
ess’’—something that sounds pretty 
scary when it is taken out of context, 
doesn’t it? 
In my opinion, I consider it media 
malpractice to blame one or two Mem-
bers of this Chamber for a year’s worth 
of bad-faith delays because Members 
have asked for a vote on certain na-
tional security issues, and the Senate 
should have weighed in on these issues 
long ago. The Senate has had the time. 
The leadership has had the time. So, 
no, that narrative cannot stand. 
All these delays and all this strife is 
the natural conclusion of the Demo-
crats’ single-minded obsession with 
their reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
My colleagues on the left have, in-
deed, squandered months trying to 
strong-arm their moderate colleagues 
into rubberstamping what I call their 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda. It is so 
toxic that even economists who many 
times are friendly with the White 
House have turned their backs on the 
proposal. Even they deem it socialist in 
nature. 
This month, we have reaped the con-
sequences of their obsession in the 
form of 6.8 percent inflation. It is al-
ready at a 40-year high. It is still tick-
ing up. Gas prices are increasing. Food 
is costing more. Warehouses are being 
cleared out. One hundred and seventy 
cargo ships are still off the coast of 
California, 150 miles out. 
But yet, until a few hours ago, really, 
the Democrats were pushing for final 
passage on a spending bill that would 
make things even worse—would make 
it worse. It is not $1.75 trillion; it is $5 
trillion. It is not paid for. It is not, 
‘‘Oh, it doesn’t cost a dime’’; it costs $3 
trillion. That is the conservative esti-
mate. 
If you look back through the record, 
you will find almost no help for our 
supply chains that I mentioned that 
are all backed up, and you will find at 
least one terrible mistake that made 
the bad situation worse. 
Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates started 
inflicting damage on the economy and 
our supply chains well before the 
courts started throwing up their road-
blocks, and thank goodness the courts 
are backing where the American people 
are on this mandate issue. 
In Tennessee, these foolish mandates 
could cost businesses more than $70 
million and force 37 percent of our 
labor force out of work. 
My Democratic colleagues, however, 
have wasted hours here on the Senate 
floor defending what is truly a blatant 
power grab. Does it make the lives of 
Tennesseans and Americans better? 
Absolutely not. It makes them worse. 
They have somehow neglected to ac-
knowledge that these mandates don’t 
reach as far as our southern border. 
Isn’t it amazing? In fact, most of the 
policies they are so eager to force on 
the American people that are making 
their lives worse evaporate once you 
hit the border, which is even more cha-
otic now than it was on day 1 of the 
Biden administration. 
If you look back on the past year, 
you will find little in the way of assist-
ance for our Border Patrol agents and 
other law enforcement officers. Oh, no, 
can’t do that. Oh, no, let’s reinvent the 
police. Let’s reinvent law enforcement. 
Oh, no, we can’t put more assets on the 
southern border to defend our sov-
ereignty. It makes you believe that the 
Democratic Party is pleased with the 
chaos that they are seeing in border 
communities all across that southern 
border. 
What my friends across the aisle 
have done is basically to hand power, 
control, and billions of dollars to those 
cartels. And they have opened up their 
arms, and they have welcomed now 
right at 2 million people to illegally 
enter this country. No vaccine man-
dates apply to them. Oh, no, sir, not at 
all—preference. Let’s go ahead. They 
can go through a separate TSA line 
when they get on a plane with a tax-
payer-funded plane ticket. And all the 
time, the lives of Americans under this 
administration, they are not as well off 
as they were a year ago. Their life is 
not as comfortable as it was a year 
ago. 
Now, if security was even an inkling 
of a priority with my colleagues, if se-
curity had any importance at all, se-
curing this Nation—you know, it is 
kind of one of the first things we are 
supposed to do, provide for the common 
defense. But this week, we finally got 
around to passing the NDAA. How 
about that? Finally got it done. 
Now, we wouldn’t have had to wait 
until this week to take the threat of 
what I call the ‘‘axis of evil’’ seri-
ously—the threats coming from Russia, 
China, Iran, North Korea. I can assure 
you, they are watching us very closely, 
and they are keeping up with what we 
are doing to protect this Nation. 
Why are they so aggressive right 
now? They are looking at Joe Biden, 
and they are saying, He is weak, he is 
not going to do anything to push back 
on us. You know, he talked about a few 
economic sanctions with Russia, but 
Putin is not worried about that. How

about 
sanctioning, 
stopping 
trade, 
sanctioning so many other areas, stop-
ping the Nord Stream 2—how about 
that—to show that we are going to deal 
with them as they, an adversary of 
ours, deserve to be dealt with? 
We don’t do any of that. Oh, no, let’s 
not make Xi Jinping mad. Let’s not do 
anything like that. Let’s not call him 
into account. Let’s let him keep car-
rying out that genocide on the Uighurs. 
Oh, and you know, let’s do this; let’s 
just have a diplomatic boycott of the 
Olympics. But go ahead and let our 
corporations, let our TV networks and 
their cameras broadcast to the world 
the glory of Beijing and Xi Jinping. 
Inconsistencies and weakness do not 
serve us well. They do not. And instead 
of looking at things that should be a 
priority, my colleagues across the aisle 
have kept their focus on trying to pass 
a gigantic spending bill that the Amer-
ican people do not want and programs 
they say we don’t need. 
But the Democrats are saying that 
we are going to pass it by whatever 
means necessary—whatever means nec-
essary. We are going to get this done. 
Thank goodness, we are leaving here, 
and it is not done. 
Now, woven into this exercise in par-
tisan brinksmanship was an ongoing ef-
fort to punch holes in the very institu-
tions that keep our government from 
collapsing into chaos. We have watched 
our Democratic colleagues fail to gain 
traction 
with 
policies 
that 
people 
haven’t asked for and, as I said, don’t 
want. But instead of setting their 
power grabs and wish list aside, the 
Democrats tried to find ways to crash 
through constitutional and institu-
tional backstops and force their will on 
the American people. 
You hear it all the time: Time is run-
ning out. We are going to lose the 
House; we are going to lose the Senate 
so we have got to do this. We have got 
to transform the country. 
Well, they have gone round after 
round with the Supreme Court and the 
Federal court packers, the anti-fili-
buster crowd, and those who wish to at-
tack the integrity of the ballot box. 
They don’t want to make it easier to 
vote and harder to cheat; they are try-
ing to make it easier to cheat and 
harder to vote. And, repeatedly, they 
continue to try to look for somebody 
who blame. It has got to be somebody 
else’s fault. 
Just yesterday, we saw a wave of 
righteous indignation over the Senate 
Parliamentarian’s refusal to allow the 
Democrats to shove amnesty for illegal 
immigrants into a budget bill. That is 
right. 
They should not have been surprised 
by the ruling. They tried it once, twice, 
three times, and every time, they 
should have known how this was going 
to end. You can’t do that. 
It is almost as if all this has nothing 
to do with the policies printed on the 
thousands upon thousands of pages the 
Democrats are hoping nobody reads— 
because they feel like they have got a 
deadline, they have got to do this, time 
is running out. By whatever means 
necessary, let’s just get it done. 
Well, there is no serious person— 
none—who could look at this past year 
and conclude that Joe Biden and his al-
lies in Congress have been acting in 
good faith, doing things the people 
want to see done, because their agenda 
has been the opposite of that. 
That is why so many elected rep-
resentatives in the House and the Sen-
ate are saying: Hey, I am going home, 
and I am talking to people. We are get-
ting calls in our office. We are getting 
emails. People are speaking up. They 
don’t like this. The more they know 
about what we are doing, the less they 
like it. 
There is no serious person who could 
look at these underhanded attacks on 
our institution and conclude that the 
Democrats believe more in the com-
mon cause of freedom than they do in 
passing their ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ 
agenda. They have got to have it. They 
have just got to have it. 
And no serious person could look at 
the past year and dispute that it is Joe 
Biden and the Democrats who were the 
architects of their own destructive 
agenda. And the reason we are all still 
here at the eleventh hour waiting on 
the majority is because they have put 
their power before the people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF SHALINA D. KUMAR 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am 
so pleased today to rise to speak about 
two incredibly competent women who 
are going to be coming before us for 
votes for the Michigan Federal district 
bench a little bit later today. 
First of all, I rise in support of the 
nomination of Judge Shalina Kumar to 
be the U.S. district court judge for the 
Eastern District of Michigan. During 
her nomination hearing, Judge Kumar 
spoke about her father, Dr. Krishna 
Kumar, who moved to the United 
States from India. Dr. Kumar taught 
all of his children to believe in them-
selves and that they could be anything 
if they put their minds to it, and that 
is just what Shalina Kumar has done. 
She was born in Royal Oak, MI, re-
ceived her undergraduate degree from 
the University of Michigan, and grad-
uated from the University of Detroit 
Mercy School of Law. She spent a dec-
ade in private practice before being ap-
pointed 
by 
Governor 
Jennifer 
Granholm to the Oakland County Sixth 
Circuit Court in 2007. 
She has since been elected by Michi-
gan voters, and since January 2018, 
Judge Kumar has served as the chief 
judge of the circuit court. During her 
time as a judge, Judge Kumar has pre-
sided over more than 10,500 cases, and 
she has served as presiding judge of the 
Adult Treatment Court, which allows 
people to avoid jail time by getting 
mental health treatment, help with 
employment and education, which is so 
important. 
During 
her 
nomination 
hearing, Judge Kumar talked about the 
amazing transformation she sees in 
people and how grateful they are for 
the opportunity to contribute to soci-
ety. 
She has also served as the chair-
person of the Oakland County Criminal 
Assignment Committee, a member of 
the 
Michigan 
State 
Bar 
profes-
sionalism committee, and a member of 
the Executive Committee of the Michi-
gan Judges Association. 
If confirmed, Judge Kumar would be 
the first Federal judge of South Asian 
descent in Michigan, and there is no 
doubt that her father and her home 
State of Michigan will be very, very 
proud. I enthusiastically support this 
nomination and hope that my col-
leagues will do the same. 
NOMINATION OF JANE M. BECKERING 
Mr. President, secondly, I rise also to 
give strong support as well for the 
nomination of Judge Jane Beckering to 
be U.S. district court judge for the 
Western District of Michigan. I can 
think of few people more qualified or 
more respected and more ready to 
serve the people of Michigan in this 
new role. 
Jane Beckering is a native of West 
Michigan. She attended the University 
of Michigan and then the University of 
Wisconsin in order to carry on her fam-
ily’s legacy. Both her father and her 
grandfather were trial lawyers—two of 
the world’s finest, according to Judge 
Beckering. They believe that Amer-
ica’s system of justice was the best in 
the world, and they taught Judge 
Beckering that civility, integrity, and 
respect for others are the trademarks 
of the legal profession. 
Judge Beckering has spent her career 
upholding these ideals. During her 
more than three decades of legal expe-
rience, she has presided over and issued 
an opinion on more than 4,000 cases. 
Since 2007, she has served as a judge on 
the Michigan Court of Appeals and is 
the chief judge pro tempore of the 
court. She was first appointed to the 
court 
by 
then-Governor 
Jennifer 
Granholm and later elected by the peo-
ple of Michigan. 
Before that, Judge Beckering was a 
trial attorney in Grand Rapids, and she 
has been actively involved in the West 
Michigan legal community. She has a 
broad range of experience in a wide 
range of cases, including multi-State 
commercial litigation, product liabil-
ity, personal injury, and wrongful 
death cases. 
For all of these reasons, Judge 
Beckering was strongly supported by 
the Western District Judicial Nomina-
tions Advisory Committee. She was 
unanimously rated ‘‘well qualified’’ by

the American Bar Association, and she 
received bipartisan support in the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. 
She is just the type of person we need 
in the Federal judiciary, and I am 
eager for her to begin her new role. I 
wholeheartedly support this nomina-
tion and encourage my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Both 
Judge 
Kumar 
and 
Judge 
Beckering are extremely qualified and 
competent judicial nominations that 
are in front of us today, and I hope ev-
eryone will be supporting them as 
strongly as I am. And I know people in 
Michigan are very, very proud of both 
of them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9280 
December 17, 2021 
ACT FOR ALS ACT 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join with my colleague the 
Senator from Alaska in celebrating 
some good news. Every now and then, 
something really good happens here in 
the Congress of the United States. 
Many of us know the story of ALS, a 
particularly cruel and brutal disease, a 
disease that attacks the body but not 
the mind and whose victims, while 
they steadily lose their ability to con-
trol their muscles and their movement, 
suffer a sort of living death that, until 
you have seen it up close, it is hard to 
appreciate just how cruel this disease 
is. 
Last week, 423 of our House col-
leagues, Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives, voted to send the ACT for 
ALS Act here to this Senate. And last 
night, we here in the Senate unani-
mously sent that bill to President 
Biden’s desk for his signature. 
I have to start, I want to start by 
thanking my dear friend and colleague 
the Senator from Alaska. She has been 
a tireless, passionate, capable advo-
cate, and without her this would not 
have happened. For those who question 
whether bipartisanship can still deliver 
results that matter, this Senator, this 
bill, this moment proves that it can 
and it does. 
We are grateful to our lead cospon-
sors over in the House, Congressman 
QUIGLEY
and Congressman FORTEN-
BERRY. 
Frankly, the story behind this mo-
ment is the incredible advocacy of the 
ALS community. They are the reason 
that the bill got drafted, the bill got 
introduced, the bill got marked up, the 
bill passed the House, and that here in 
the Senate some obstructions were 
overcome with remarkable force and 
swiftness. I am just briefly going to 
mention the tenacity and the strength 
and the capability of some of the folks 
who have been my role models in this 
work, and then I am going to yield to 
my friend and colleague from Alaska, 
and she will also speak about it. 
I just do also briefly want to say that 
ACT for ALS is not just some resolu-
tion. It is not just some commemora-
tive act. This will deliver $100 million 
through a newly authorized FDA rare 
neurodegenerative disease grant pro-
gram. It will fund critical research. It 
will improve coordination between the 
Federal, academic, and private sector 
researchers. And more than anything 
else, it will give people hope. 
When I think of this work, Dan Tate 
is the man who first comes to mind, 
and Dan, like me, is a graduate of Am-
herst College and a spirited and capa-
ble and soulful person—one of Washing-
ton’s most skilled lobbyists, someone 
who worked in the Clinton administra-
tion and worked for a Member of the 
House—and his personal advocacy has 
meant a huge amount to me, as has the 
engagement by Brian Wallach and so 
many others. 
And I have a half dozen other folks of 
whom I want to speak, but, first, I 
think simple decency suggests I should 
yield the floor to my friend and col-
league from Alaska. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as 
my friend from Connecticut has point-
ed out, there are—— 
Mr. COONS. Point of personal clari-
fication: Delaware. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Oh, my goodness, 
my soul. 
Mr. President, may I strike that er-
roneous introduction? 
Mr. COONS. Born in Connecticut. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my dear 
friend from Delaware—always Dela-
ware—but truly a friend; a friend on 
many different issues, but a man whom 
I have come to know is motivated not 
by the politics of what goes on in this 
body but by the passion and his inter-
est in doing good, doing good policy 
and doing good things for people. 
And what we are speaking to today, 
recognizing the significant passage of 
the ACT for ALS Act that happened 
last evening unanimously, as he has 
pointed out, that this is not only good 
for the body, if you will, to say we were 
able to move good legislation forward, 
good policy legislation forward, but 
this is a gift. This is a gift of hope for 
those who live with ALS, for those 
families who are part of that journey of 
those who live with ALS. 
ALS, as Senator COONS has noted, is 
an awful, awful disease. Some would 
suggest, and I certainly would, that it 
is probably the worst disease to be af-
flicted with, when your body literally 
closes in on you while your mind is 
still active and vibrant. 
I have a very personal connection to 
ALS. I think many of us have very per-
sonal connections to ALS. I wish that 
we didn’t have these personal connec-
tions to this hideous disease, but we 
do, and that connection allows us to 
learn and understand a little bit more 
about it. 
And I think the most heartbreaking 
thing that I realized, when my family 
member was diagnosed with ALS, my 
cousin’s husband, was that there was 
no treatment. There was no hope. 
There was no hope. 
I am not suggesting that the ACT for 
ALS is the end-all be-all. I wish that 
we could stand here and say that. It is 
not, but what it is, is a glimmer of 
hope. 
I want to read just a couple sentences 
from an email that I received last 
evening when I was able to share this 
good news that this bill was passing 
unanimously through this body, and 
my cousin Jen says: 
The passage of this bill will bring real, tan-
gible hope to people living with ALS and 
those to be diagnosed. In this ALS world, 
right now, there are no effective treatments. 
All we have is hope. This bill changes every-
thing. It will bring real, tangible hope and 
treatments to people living with ALS. We 
have never had that in this disease. 
We 
haven’t 
found 
the 
cure, 
we 
haven’t found the treatment, but what 
we are providing today is that first 
step forward, a tangible step forward to 
the hope, because every day—every 
day—those who are living with ALS 
and their loved ones, who live through 
this disease with them, have to hope 
and pray every single day that today is 
going to be the day. Today is going to 
be the day that we can slow this, that 
we can halt this. 
There are some extraordinary heroes 
that have been involved with this fight 
over the years. They are everyday peo-
ple. They got into it not because they 
were paid lobbyists. Most of them got 
into it because they had lived through 
ALS. They had lost a loved one to this 
disease, and rather than to give up and 
give in and be too tired to carry on, 
they said: I am going to commit so 
that no other families have to feel this 
helplessness. 
And so you have got some amazing 
people. You have got a group out there, 
the I AM ALS team—extraordinary, ex-
traordinary advocates. 
Senator COONS has mentioned Brian 
Wallach and Dan Tate. The two of 
them lead I AM ALS. You have got 
Megan Miller, Deb Paust, Sandy Mor-
ris, Christa Thompson, Nicole Cimbura, 
Becky Mourey, Michael Lecker, Shelly 
Hoover, Michelle Lorenz, Mayuri and 
Mayank Saxena—so many, so many 
more who were part of that effort. 
The I AM ALS organization, working 
with the ALS Association, working 
with the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion and so many others were so crit-
ical in moving this forward. Think 
about what happened. 
This was introduced over here in the 
Senate. We looked this up. It was May 
25. May 25. And to get over 60 cospon-
sors in the U.S. Senate on any kind of 
a measure—I wish that the Senator 
from Delaware and I could say that we 
single-handedly got every single one of 
those cosponsors, but it was these ad-
vocates. It was these grassroots indi-
viduals. It was everybody that I just 
named—Dan and Megan and Jenny and 
Deb and Sandy, who made these calls, 
who were relentless. 
And when the politics did intervene, 
they were unleashed and passionate in 
their advocacy. And I think this is a 
good lesson to us, that when those who 
are intimately and passionately in-
volved, that you can make a difference, 
you can move legislation. You can 
move mountains. 
The last thing I want to say before I 
turn back to my colleague here is that 
there are a lot of people who are not 
part of an organization but who have 
just felt compelled to speak up. 
We heard voices from around my 
State: Marcel from Sitka; Douglas 
from Anchorage; a gentleman by the 
name of Mike, also from Anchorage. 
The calls, the letters, the emails that 
we got—I know all of our colleagues re-
ceived the same as well. 
So this, again, was an effort that was 
so personal to so many, but the leader-
ship that I think we saw come together 
with Brian Wallach, his wife Sandra—

they were the founders there of I AM 
ALS. 
Brian was only 37 years old when he 
was diagnosed with ALS—37—so super 
young. And he was told 6 months: You 
have got 6 months to live. 
He is a father to two little girls, and 
he just said: Got to keep fighting. We 
have got to keep fighting for a cure—a 
cure that will allow him to raise his 
daughters with his wife. 
And I think it is fair to say that, 4 
years later now, Brian is just as deter-
mined, just as tireless an advocate for 
ALS and the ALS community. 
So, again, I think about people like 
Brian and Dan, my cousin Jenny, who 
lost Pat to this awful disease in 2013. 
He lived with ALS for 8 years. Our fam-
ily lived with ALS for those 8 years. 
And so the advocacy continues be-
cause of the passion for so many who 
have lived through a life that is almost 
difficult for us to imagine. 
And as they have come out of losing 
a loved one to a disease like this, to 
know that they are willing to carry 
that flag, that they are willing to com-
mit their time, their resources, and ev-
erything that they have so that others 
don’t go through this, we honor them. 
We honor that commitment. 
I am so pleased to be able to work 
with my partner on this and to know 
that this was a good success, but we 
are going to need to be doing more, and 
I will be doing it with him. 
I yield to my friend from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. I want to express my 
gratitude to my friend and colleague 
from Alaska. 
It is, indeed, a deep well of darkness 
into which a family is cast when they 
receive a diagnosis of ALS. 
My own awareness of this disease and 
its dread consequences is rooted in a 
number of cases that came to me and 
my extended family now quite a few 
years ago. 
My brother is with us here in the 
Chamber today, and his dear friend 
Dan Loftus passed through ALS, and I 
remember the pain that this caused 
him and the depth of that loss. 
A friend of mine from Delaware, Alex 
Snyder-Mackler, first shared with me 
his father Scott’s diagnosis with ALS, 
now 20 years ago. And year after year, 
as many of us would gather in Newark 
and run a 5K and do a fundraiser for 
some sort of research, for some sort of 
hope, his father Scott slowly slipped 
away. 
I talked to Alex this morning and 
was reminded of how much this means 
to those families who have come 
through this. 
Max Walton, a dear friend of mine in 
the bar in Delaware, and his father— 
just an unbelievable character, a great 
and funny and creative and capable 
man who built a family business and 
then slipped from us through ALS. 
ALS was first known to America 
when Lou Gehrig, an outstanding base-
ball player, got it. And he is still fa-
mous for his ‘‘I am the luckiest man in 
the world’’ speech, when he announced 
his retirement from baseball. 
But 80 years later—80 years later—it 
is still a mystery to science and a 
death sentence to those who get this 
dread diagnosis who are often told they 
have just a few short years to live. This 
bill in their name and honor confronts 
this stark reality and makes progress. 
I cannot close without thanking two 
other people—Meghan Taira, who is 
tireless here on the floor in helping 
move and prioritize things working for 
Leader SCHUMER, who lost her own 
mother, Ellen Taira, to ALS, and last, 
if I could, for someone whom I am not 
worthy of. 
I have a legislative director, Brian 
Winseck, who is a spectacular human 
being, whose skill and persistence and 
diligence and dedication for my side of 
this kept us at it every day. His father 
Joseph was a high school civics teach-
er, and the loss of his life through ALS 
is something from which Brian has 
made so much good for others through 
his role in helping shepherd this 
through my office. 
What Senator MURKOWSKI and I are 
showing for a moment here today is an 
answer to a question so many families, 
so many people living with ALS, so 
many who have lost a loved one to ALS 
wonder in the dark moments: Does 
anyone care? Does anyone see this? 
Does anyone know what is happening? 
Is anyone going to do something about 
this? 
The families and those who are living 
today with ALS and those who have 
lost someone to ALS need to know that 
your advocacy is heard, that it moved 
a mountain here in the Congress, and it 
will begin moving resources and energy 
and dedication. 
We are at the beginning of the next 
step of this journey, but, as my dear 
friend, under whom I served many, 
many years ago in a very dark time in 
the history of South Africa, said: Hope. 
Hope is being able to see that despite 
all the darkness, there is still light. 
Bishop Desmond Tutu spoke that to 
the people of South Africa struggling 
in a very dark time and place. 
To the families, the survivors, and 
those who are living with ALS, my 
dear friend from Alaska and I and the 
folks in our families and on our staff 
and in the many countless teams of ad-
vocates around this country hope that 
this holiday season, that this Christ-
mas, that this year, we have brought 
you some glimmer of the light that you 
have brought to us. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL RANDI 
LUDINGTON 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
think here in the Senate, so many of us 
have the privilege to occasionally host 
military fellows, congressional mili-
tary fellows, and I would like to take 
just a minute here to recognize the 
great work of a former member of my 
staff, 
Air 
Force 
Lt. 
Col. 
Randi 
Ludington. She spent the last year 
working in my personal office as part 
of the U.S. Air Force congressional fel-
lowship program. She just concluded 
that fellowship program just last week 
and has moved on to her next assign-
ment, but I think it is important to be 
able to publicly express my apprecia-
tion for the work she did over the last 
year and really for her service to the 
Nation overall. 
For 17 years now, Randi has served in 
the U.S. Air Force. She was first an en-
listed financial technician before she 
earned her commission and worked her 
way up to the rank of lieutenant colo-
nel. She had a level of exposure before 
coming to my office certainly. These 
experiences of being in different places 
around the world, leading airmen, ad-
vising commanders, really proved in-
valuable when she came to provide her 
expertise in my office. 
Not only has she spearheaded efforts 
legislatively and prepped me for meet-
ings and hearings, she really became a 
key member of our team, working with 
Alaskans, working with counterparts 
back here, but really serving them just 
as she would serve her own troops. 
When we were faced with a very cha-
otic 
withdrawal 
from 
Afghanistan, 
Randi was one of those who was really 
burning the midnight oil. She was put-
ting in long days and long nights, an-
swering calls from constituents and 
veterans who were seeking help. She 
was doing just that. She was there 
around the clock, sometimes just lis-
tening, offering words of support; other 
times just really helping to syn-
chronize the efforts between people on 
the ground in Kabul, lining them up 
with Departments and Agencies here in 
Washington, 
doing 
everything 
she 
could to try to help facilitate the needs 
of so many who were so desperate to 
get out. 
In the end, Randi was honored by an 
Alaska 
Native 
Corporation, 
the 
Goldbelt Corporation. They had been 
engaged in an airlift, a significant air-
lift, and she was recognized by Goldbelt 
for her dedicated efforts assisting them 
throughout that whole ordeal. So it 
was nice to know that she had received 
not only the recognition and thanks 
from those here, fellows back in Alas-
ka, but also the broader international 
recognition. 
So I take this moment to just express 
my thanks to Randi. It was a pleasure 
having her in my office. She has a fabu-
lous family. It was a great pleasure to 
be able to get to meet her husband 
Brad, an Air Force veteran himself. 
They have three super-great little kids: 
Charlee, Ryan, and Graham. 
I wish Randi and her family nothing 
but the best as she moves forward with 
her military career. 
I feel very fortunate that we get 
some of our Nation’s best, who are able

to take kind of a little bit of a detour 
through their professional trajectory 
in the military to come here, work 
with us, share their level of expertise, 
and also educate themselves on the in-
ternal process we have here. 
I was very fortunate to have her as 
part of my team. I think we should all 
be proud to know that it is leaders like 
her who comprise our military. 
So, again, thank you, Randi, for what 
you have done for our country and 
what you have done to help Alaska. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SASSE. I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CARDIN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
PURDUE UNIVERSITY 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, according 
to ProPublica reporting, a Purdue stu-
dent from China, Zhihao Kong, who 
goes by the nickname ‘‘Moody,’’ wrote 
a letter condemning the Chinese Com-
munist Party for killing dissidents in 
Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
We all know the famous image of the 
man who stood courageously, not in 
front of one tank—most of the images 
that ran in U.S. newspapers were of one 
guy standing in front of a tank. And if 
you just look at that image, you can 
assume that the tank commander is 
some nutjob who decided he was going 
to torment this kid. But if you actu-
ally look at the image, as you can 
through U.S. photo archives, and you 
pan back out, that first tank is one 
tank in a long, long, long, long line of 
tanks coming that this man stands 
courageously in front of. It is not one 
nutjob tank commander looking at this 
guy in Tiananmen Square; it is an 
autocratic government that is scared 
to death of the courage of free people. 
And that man stood there courageously 
as the Chinese Communist Party was 
murdering 
students 
in 
Tiananmen 
Square. 
The 
Purdue 
graduate 
student, 
Moody, decided to write an open letter 
about 
that 
reminding 
students 
in 
America and around the world of what 
happened in Tiananmen Square. 
Well, guess what happened next. 
After Moody published his essay, Chi-
na’s secret police decided to go visit 
his family and intimidate them so that 
they might put pressure on him, asking 
him, commanding him, coercing him, 
twisting the arms of his parents and 
loved ones, to stop talking about the 
truth, 
about 
what 
happened 
in 
Tiananmen Square in June of 1989. 
When Mr. Kong refused to back down, 
other Chinese students at Purdue—not 
Chinese students in Beijing, Chinese 
graduate students at Purdue—decided 
that it was their obligation to harass 
Mr. Kong. They pursued him around 
campus, and they threatened to report 
him to the Chinese Embassy. Think 
about that for a second. 
What do we think about Embassies as 
for? Two hundred countries around the 
face of the Earth, and when you are 
traveling and you have a lost passport 
or you suffer some, you know, petty 
crime or you have a family member 
who has a medical emergency back 
home, you call up your Embassy for 
help because you think these are peo-
ple who love you. You are in a foreign 
place and you don’t maybe speak the 
language and the Embassy is there to 
help you navigate a world where you 
might not know the language, the 
laws, or the customs. 
What 
happened 
in 
the 
United 
States—a freedom-loving place—is that 
these Chinese students, Chinese nation-
als here in school at Purdue, decided 
that they thought it might be their job 
to contact the Chinese Embassy to tat-
tle on Mr. Kong because the man had 
the courage to tell the truth. He had 
spoken online. He had written online. 
He had been involved in dissident 
events. 
So what happened then, besides his 
parents being harassed by the Chinese 
secret police and besides graduate stu-
dents following him around campus to 
intimidate him and threaten to report 
him to the Embassy, WeChat decided 
that they needed to block and suspend 
his account to cut off his communica-
tions with the outside world. 
A few days before he was scheduled 
to speak at a Zoom commemoration of 
the Tiananmen Square massacre, the 
secret police went to visit his parents 
again, reminding them that they need-
ed to make sure he put an end to his 
activism—read ‘‘truth-telling.’’ 
It is convenient for Americans to 
look the other way and stay silent in 
the face of this. We have seen many 
American professional sports leagues; 
we have seen Hollywood companies 
lusting after Chinese middle-class mar-
kets; we have seen the Marriott hotel 
chain agreeing to intimidate their own 
employees so that their employees 
didn’t acknowledge what has happened 
in Hong Kong and the threats currently 
against Taiwan; we have seen this cen-
sorship using economic statecraft from 
Beijing to intimidate Americans and 
American companies and American in-
stitutions to do their bidding to sup-
press people who might tell the truth. 
It is convenient to stay silent. Many 
of our institutions have pathetically 
agreed with Beijing that they would 
self-censor at Beijing’s and Chairman 
Xi’s bidding. 
Well, guess who didn’t do that. Pur-
due University decided they were not 
going to do that. 
So there is a lot of bad stuff hap-
pening in the world because of the ex-
pansionistic desires of the CCP, and we 
have a lot of Americans and American 
institutions who are willing to be 
complicit in the CCP’s desired expan-
sionism, but Purdue didn’t. So we 
should pause today, just for a minute, 
and celebrate that good news. We 
should celebrate that courage. 
Mitch Daniels, former Governor of 
Indiana, current President of Purdue, 
decided that this was not OK, and it 
was important to tell the truth about 
this fact, what had happened, and that 
this wasn’t OK. 
I would like to read into the CON-
GRESSIONAL
RECORD
today President 
Daniels’ letter to the Purdue campus 36 
hours ago because we need a hell of a 
lot more truth-telling like this in 
American life. Here is Mitch Daniels 
and the Purdue leadership on behalf of 
not just Purdue but American values: 
Dear Purdue students, staff and faculty, 
Purdue [has] learned from a national news 
account last week that one of our students, 
after speaking out on behalf of freedom and 
others martyred for advocating for [free-
dom], was harassed and threatened by other 
students from his own home country [in this 
country]. Worse still, [this student’s] family 
back home, in this case [the home being] 
China, was visited and threatened by agents 
of that nation’s secret police. 
We regret that we were unaware at the 
time of these events and [we] had to learn of 
them from national sources. That reflects 
the atmosphere of intimidation that we have 
discovered [surrounding] this specific sort of 
speech. 
Any such intimidation is unacceptable and 
[it is] unwelcome on our campus. Purdue has 
punished less personal, direct and threat-
ening conduct. Anyone taking exception to 
the speech in question had their own right to 
express their disagreement, but not to en-
gage in the actions of harassment which oc-
curred here. If those students who issued the 
threats can be identified, they will be subject 
to appropriate disciplinary action. Likewise, 
any student found to have reported another 
student to any foreign entity for exercising 
their freedom of speech or belief will be sub-
ject to significant [action]. 
International students are nothing new at 
Purdue University, which welcomed its first 
Asian admittees over a century ago. We are 
proud that several hundred international 
students, nearly 200 of them [from China], 
enrolled [at Purdue] again this fall. 
But joining the Purdue community re-
quires acceptance of [our] rules and values, 
and no value is more central to our institu-
tion or to higher education generally than 
the freedom of inquiry and expression. Those 
seeking to deny those rights to others, let 
alone to collude with foreign governments in 
repressing them, will need to pursue their 
education elsewhere. 
Sincerely, 
Mitch 
Chairman Xi is a coward, and he 
sends his goons to intimidate people 
for telling the truth. That is who 
Chairman Xi is. He doesn’t believe in 
the dignity of people. He doesn’t be-
lieve that they are image-bearers of 
God. He doesn’t believe they have the 
rights of free speech, religion, press, as-
sembly, and protest. He believes that 
you must intimidate college students 
for telling the truth. If they are saying 
something to a small group of people 
6,000 miles away, Chairman Xi is in-
timidated, and he is scared. 
That student told the truth. We 
should celebrate that student. Mitch 
Daniels and Purdue University stood 
up to that kind of intimidation. We 
should celebrate that because that is 
what American courage looks like, and 
we need a whole hell of a lot more of it.

We need a lot more people to look like 
the Women’s Tennis Association, not 
to look like the NBA. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
REMEMBERING GENERAL RAY ODIERNO 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to GEN Raymond 
Odierno, one of the greatest com-
manders of his, or any other, genera-
tion of American military leaders. 
Ray served the Army and the Nation 
with great distinction. He attended 
West Point, and following graduation, 
he went on to serve nearly 40 years in 
the Army, retiring as a four-star gen-
eral. 
Ray’s service took him around the 
world, from Germany and Albania to 
Kuwait and Iraq. He reached the 
heights of his career as the commander 
of all coalition forces in Iraq and a ten-
ure as the 38th Chief of Staff of the 
U.S. Army. 
Throughout his distinguished career, 
Ray was an inspirational force to the 
men and women he commanded and the 
leaders he advised. His character, pro-
fessional skills, and abiding love and 
respect for those around him made him 
a preeminent soldier. His steadfast loy-
alty and commitment to his fellow sol-
diers and veterans was unwavering. 
I was privileged to have worked ex-
tensively with Ray. His courageous 
leadership in so many demanding jobs 
leaves me with great admiration and 
gratitude. 
We were both West Pointers and both 
had the privilege of serving in the 
Army, so we shared many things in 
common. 
I recall first meeting Ray in Iraq 
when he commanded the 4th Infantry 
Division. I was immediately struck by 
his presence, his keen insight, and the 
mutual and profound respect he shared 
with his troops. His example of selfless 
service, dedication to his mission and 
his soldiers, together with his personal 
integrity and decency, sustained and 
inspired all who served with him. 
I also had the privilege of working 
closely with him while he served as 
Chief of Staff of the Army. He proved 
an innovative and resourceful leader 
who continued to focus on soldiers and 
their families as he maintained an 
Army on the most robust deployment 
schedule in our lifetime. 
Ray’s love for his country was sur-
passed only by his love of family—his 
wonderful wife Linda and their three 
children; Tony, Katie, and Mike; and 
their beautiful grandchildren. 
I offer the Odierno family my deepest 
condolences on his passing and thank 
them for sharing Ray with us for so 
many years. 
The Odierno family’s military tradi-
tion runs deep and strong. Ray’s father 
was an Army sergeant in World War II. 
And his son, retired Army Captain 
Tony Odierno, also graduated from 
West Point. Tony served with distinc-
tion in Iraq before he was wounded 
there and came home and found other 
ways to serve. I know that legacy of 
service will continue and manifest 
itself in many different ways. 
Ray Odierno was a powerful, inspir-
ing person. He dedicated his life’s work 
to serving others, and his was a life 
well-lived. He will be missed by all who 
have had the privilege to know him and 
to serve with him. 
I am proud to honor the legacy of 
GEN Ray Odierno, and I know the 
Members of the Senate will join me in 
recognizing the incredible contribu-
tions he made for our Nation. 
And in words familiar to all West 
Pointers: 
And when our work is done, 
Our course on earth is run, 
May it be said, ‘‘Well done; be thou at 
peace.’’ 
GEN Raymond Odierno, well done. Be 
thou at peace. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. 
MURPHY. 
Madam 
President, 
news from this morning that 50 so- 
called battalion tactical groups have 
been sent to the Ukraine border by 
President Vladimir Putin—reports in 
American newspapers suggest that over 
the last several days there has been an 
increased amount of movement in Rus-
sian military assets to the Ukraine 
border. 
This is a crisis that is deepening. 
There remains a diplomatic off-ramp, 
but that off-ramp only exists if Vladi-
mir Putin sees the United States and 
its allies, especially those in Europe, 
united in our desire to support Ukraine 
in its time of need with the kind of as-
sets they will need to defend them-
selves, but also with a commitment to 
levy unprecedented sanctions on Rus-
sia, long-lasting, deep sanctions, if 
they go forward with an incursion 
deeper into Ukraine than Russia al-
ready is. 
But, right now, as we speak on the 
Senate floor, a small handful of Senate 
Republicans are blocking the key dip-
lomatic personnel that would be able 
to unite U.S. policy with Europe 
around Russia’s threatened invasion of 
Ukraine. And so I hear a lot of really 
strong-sounding press statements from 
many of my Republican colleagues, 
often the exact same Republican col-
leagues who are blocking these nomi-
nees, about how Joe Biden needs to 
stand strong for Ukraine, while, at the 
same time, they are down here on the 
floor denying President Biden the per-
sonnel that he needs in order to enact 
a policy that can save Ukraine from 
disaster—the Assistant Secretary for 
International Organizations, the U.S. 
Representative to the EU, the U.S. 
Representative to OECD, numerous 
Ambassadors to European countries, 
including our Ambassador to France, 
France being one of the key nations 
that will help orchestrate a policy of 
cohesion amongst European nations 
with respect to the crisis in Ukraine. 
And so everybody sees what is going 
on here. Not all of my Republican col-
leagues, but a small handful of my Re-
publican colleagues, are setting the 
President 
up, 
raising 
expectations 
about what he should be able to do to 
save Ukraine but then denying him the 
personnel to get it done. 
And I understand that, you know, the 
refrain from my Republican colleagues 
is, well, you know, Senator SCHUMER 
should just file cloture. They know 
how this works. For cloture, because of 
our current rules, the whole process 
takes days. We have pages full of nomi-
nees that we have to do. We wouldn’t 
be able to conduct any other business. 
The Senate has never run like this. 
When the Senate has had qualified 
nominees like Jack Markell, Mark 
Gitenstein, Denise Bauer in front of it, 
it has never required days of debate, 
cloture motions, in order to get key 
personnel, especially at times of need 
right now. 
I hope we get an agreement to move 
nominees, but, frankly, time is running 
short for Ukraine. Time is running 
short for the Ukrainian people, and my 
Republican 
colleagues—the 
handful 
that are blocking these nominees—bet-
ter decide whether they are interested 
in scoring political points or whether 
they are interested in standing up for 
the security of the United States and 
the security of the Ukrainian people. 
REMEMBERING EDITH PRAGUE 
Madam President, when they made 
Edith Prague, who died Thursday at 
the age of 96, they broke the mold. I 
am confident of this because in my 48 
years on this Earth, I have never, ever 
met another person like her. 
I knew Edith Prague as my colleague 
in the Connecticut State Senate, where 
she served from 1994 to 2012, retiring as 
the oldest member of that chamber at 
age 86. She was a friend of mine and a 
mentor. She modeled a form of public 
service for me that I will be eternally 
grateful for. There was no one in Con-
necticut public life as persistent, as 
dogged, as forceful, as Edith Prague. 
She woke up every day thinking 
about the plight of workers, the poor, 
and the elderly. She had an acute sense 
of the injustice done to those who la-
bored in difficult jobs, those making 
poverty wages, and those people who 
were living on fixed incomes. 
And when she believed that a cause 
was right, she would not back down. In 
1991, Governor Lowell Weicker hired 
her to be his commissioner of aging, 
and then, a year later, he fired her be-
cause when he told her that she needed 
to fold her agency into a bigger depart-
ment to save money, she refused. 
When she was elected to the State 
senate, she was a tireless worker, a

fighter for workplace safety laws, for 
raising the minimum wage, and for el-
derly nutrition programs. When she be-
lieved that a cause was just, nothing 
could stop her. She was relentless. I re-
member sitting in these closed-door 
Democratic caucus meetings with her, 
and she would introduce a bill at the 
beginning of the session, usually a bill 
way ahead of its time, expanding work-
ers’ rights or increasing supports for 
the elderly. And every week—every 
week—she would argue the case, and 
she wouldn’t stop talking until she had 
persuaded at least one additional State 
senator in the room to support her bill. 
At the beginning of the session, sen-
ate leaders would tell her: ‘‘No, Edith, 
we are not doing that bill this year,’’ 
or ‘‘No, we just can’t afford it.’’ And 
she just wouldn’t listen. She never saw 
a stop sign. 
I have never seen anybody like this. 
She never saw a stop sign when there 
was something worthwhile to be done 
for the vulnerable. She would bring 
that bill up over and over and over 
again, and, eventually, she would just 
wear everybody down, and she would 
get it done. 
She was in her seventies when I met 
her, and she had twice as much energy 
and stamina as I did. She was a force of 
nature. The last major bill she passed, 
she was 86 years old. It was a landmark 
piece of legislation granting home care 
workers the ability to organize and col-
lectively bargain. She fought for the 
bill’s uncertain passage all year, and 
then she stood on her feet for 6 hours, 
defending it in a marathon Senate de-
bate. 
She did all this with her trademark 
wide grin, smile, her big laugh. She was 
a consummate pain in the ass, but ev-
erybody loved her because, although 
she worked on issues of such gravity 
and seriousness and controversy, she 
brought such transparent, outward joy 
to her work. She knew she was a pain, 
and she chuckled when people tried to 
push her aside because she just knew 
she was going to outlast them. 
I learned so much from her. She took 
me under her wing. She treated me so 
kindly when I came to the Senate as a 
naive 29-year-old. She believed in me, 
and her confidence meant the world to 
me. 
Her energy and her enthusiasm for 
the causes she worked on gave me en-
ergy and enthusiasm for the things 
that mattered to me. 
I think about her a lot when I work 
on the issue of gun violence. It wasn’t 
one of the issues that drove Edith, but, 
you know, some days, it is hard to keep 
going on an issue like this when so lit-
tle progress is being made nationally. 
But then I think of Edith, who never 
ever gave up when a thing was the 
right thing to do, in her mind, and her 
memory will keep me going, and I 
know it will keep a lot of other people 
going in Connecticut who knew her. 
Longtime political reporter Mark 
Pazniokas writes for the Connecticut 
Mirror. He wrote a beautiful story 
about Edith this week, and I will close 
with what he wrote: 
[Edith] Prague did not go gentle, any-
where. She lived Dylan Thomas’s poetry, his 
belief that ‘‘old age should burn and rave at 
close of day.’’ She fought governors, fellow 
lawmakers, and, most consistently, the no-
tion of retirement, a status finally imposed 
on her by a confluence of strokes and con-
cerns of family and physician. 
‘‘My only choice is to retire or drop dead. 
I have to retire. Believe me, I don’t like it,’’ 
Prague said when she left state employment 
as the 88-year-old commissioner of aging in 
2014. ‘‘Lots of people look forward to retire-
ment,’’ she said, ‘‘but I’m not one of them.’’ 
Edith was one of a kind, and the im-
pact she left on people who knew her, 
like me, and the people who never met 
her, like those she fought for, is indel-
ible. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, as 
we are now in December and the year is 
winding down, I am reflecting on one of 
the first actions, one of the first deci-
sions I made when I joined the Senate 
back in January, and that was a deci-
sion to establish a judicial evaluation 
commission with folks back in Cali-
fornia, professionals who would help 
me find, vet, and recommend can-
didates to President Biden to serve on 
California’s Federal courts. 
Usually when the general public 
thinks about Federal courts, they tend 
to only think about the Supreme 
Court, but, as those who work in this 
body know, the vast majority of Fed-
eral cases—indeed, more than 99 per-
cent of all Federal cases—are decided 
at the district court or circuit court 
level. So, as we go about our work to 
strengthen the justice system in Amer-
ica, I think it is important that we 
give proper attention and support to 
district and circuit courts. 
Fast-forward to today and the items 
that we are working on literally as we 
speak. Nominees to every level of the 
Federal judiciary by the prior adminis-
tration—let me put it mildly here. We 
are far from diverse, far from rep-
resentative of our Nation, and as a re-
sult, the Federal courts and those who 
sit on the Federal bench do not reflect 
the diverse, vibrant America that it 
serves. And I am not just talking about 
gender. I am not just talking about 
race and ethnicity. For too long, the 
bench of our Federal courts has been 
dominated by corporate lawyers and 
former prosecutors. 
Now, prosecutors and corporate law-
yers do contribute valuable and impor-
tant expertise to the Federal judiciary. 
That is why I have supported the nomi-
nation of some this year. But the judi-
ciary also needs the knowledge and 
perspective of legal professionals who 
have taken different paths. I am talk-
ing about public defenders, who uphold 
our constitutional commitment that 
every person deserves fair representa-
tion and due process. I am talking 
about public interest lawyers, who de-
fend fundamental rights and the rule of 
law. I am talking about consumer and 
voting rights lawyers, labor and immi-
gration lawyers, and local government 
lawyers, who serve diverse clients and 
advocate for different interests and 
bring critical insights on how working- 
class Americans interact with the law. 
We need all these perspectives in 
order to rebalance our Federal courts 
and hopefully in the process rebuild 
and reaffirm public confidence in the 
fairness of their rulings. Our country is 
stronger and fairer when every level of 
our government reflects the voices and 
the experiences of all Americans—not 
just the privileged, not just the power-
ful. 
A Federal bench that includes more 
voices can better provide justice for 
all. That is why, over the course of the 
past year, I have worked with my com-
mission that I established back in Jan-
uary—which, by the way, is 70 percent 
attorneys of color and a majority 
women, and I am proud to share that— 
along with Senator FEINSTEIN
and 
President Biden, to find, to nominate, 
and to support a new generation of 
qualified, 
outstanding, 
and 
profes-
sionally diverse Federal judges—a Fed-
eral bench that is diverse in every 
sense of the word. 
As a result of these efforts and pend-
ing confirmation votes that I hope will 
soon occur, I am so proud that Califor-
nia’s district court bench will soon in-
clude Maame Frimpong, a proud daugh-
ter and wife of immigrants from 
Ghana, who used her law degree to 
fight for consumers and strengthen 
global democracy. 
It will soon include Judge Jennifer 
Thurston, who earned her law degree as 
a night student while raising a family 
and spent a decade serving in county 
government. 
It will soon include Judge Jinsook 
Ohta, an immigrant from South Korea, 
who spent nearly 10 years of her career 
helping to prosecute unfair business 
practices and to protect consumers 
from fraud. 
It will soon include Judge Linda 
Lopez, who spent more than 10 years as 
a public defender in San Diego. 
It will soon include Judge Hernan 
Vera, the son of Argentine immigrants, 
who spent a decade fighting for the dis-
advantaged and leading the Nation’s 
largest pro bono law firm. 
In addition, the Ninth Circuit Court 
of Appeals now includes Judge Lucy 
Koh, whom we recently confirmed, an 
expert litigator of intellectual prop-
erty cases and the first Korean-Amer-
ican woman to serve on the Federal 
circuit court. 
The Ninth Circuit will also soon in-
clude Justice Gabriel Sanchez, the 
proud son of a single mother from Mex-
ico, who has earned wide recognition as 
a public servant and an appellate judge 
on California’s court of appeal. 
It will soon include Judge Holly 
Thomas, the granddaughter of share-
croppers, who has made a career of 
fighting for the civil rights of all 
Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9285 
December 17, 2021 
I celebrate each of these outstanding 
nominees, and I thank them for their 
service to this country. I urge their 
swift confirmation. 
Now, of course, we will still have a 
long way to go and much more work to 
do, 
but 
these 
confirmations, 
col-
leagues, represent a big step in the 
right direction. 
I am proud of the work we have done 
so far to diversify the Federal bench, 
and I am committed to keeping up the 
momentum that we have started in 
that critical mission in 2022. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Senate will soon vote on 10 judicial 
nominees—nine for district courts and 
one for the Ninth Circuit appeals 
court—as we continue the critical work 
of restoring balance to our Federal ju-
diciary. 
Before briefly speaking on their 
records, I want to offer a few broad ob-
servations. I continue to be impressed 
by the experience, qualifications, and 
professional 
diversity 
that 
we 
see 
among President Biden’s judicial nomi-
nees. 
Looking at these 10 in particular: 
Nine currently serve as either State 
court or Federal magistrate judges; 
three have worked for county or State 
governments; 
two 
have 
previously 
served as Federal public defenders; one 
has served as a Federal prosecutor, 
while another has worked in various 
roles at the Justice Department; one 
has worked for a leading civil rights or-
ganization; and several have worked in 
private legal practice. 
The judiciary is stronger when our 
judges come from an array of profes-
sional backgrounds, including those 
that have been historically underrep-
resented on the bench. Furthermore, 
all 10 of these nominees are highly 
qualified, with broad experience and 
distinguished records. Each of them 
has demonstrated their commitment to 
impartiality and evenhandedness. And 
they will be ready upon confirmation 
to fully dedicate themselves to the de-
mands of the bench. 
First is Judge Linda Lopez, nomi-
nated to the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of California. For 
the past 3 years, Judge Lopez has 
served as a magistrate judge in the 
Southern District of California, where 
she has presided over seven bench 
trials. Prior to her appointment, Judge 
Lopez spent 25 years as a criminal de-
fense attorney, first in private practice 
and then as a Federal public defender 
for more than a decade. During this 
time, she appeared in court frequently 
and tried 11 jury trials. 
With such extensive trial experience, 
both on and off the bench, it is no sur-
prise that Judge Lopez received a 
unanimous rating of ‘‘well qualified’’ 
from the American Bar Association. 
She has the strong support not only of 
her home State Senators—Senators 
FEINSTEIN and PADILLA—but also of top 
Federal prosecutors in the Southern 
District of California, including the 
Deputy U.S. Attorney and Criminal Di-
vision Chief. 
We will also vote on Judge Jinsook 
Ohta’s nomination to the Southern 
District of California. Judge Ohta is 
currently a judge on the San Diego Su-
perior Court, where she handles family 
law cases involving domestic violence, 
child custody, and child support— 
among many other issues. 
Prior to assuming the bench, Judge 
Ohta spent nearly a decade with the 
consumer protection section of the 
California Attorney General’s Office. 
In this role, she handled major cases 
involving 
healthcare 
fraud, 
illegal 
robocalls—and oversaw an investiga-
tion into Facebook’s violations of con-
sumer privacy rights. 
Judge Ohta has been rated ‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the ABA, and she has the 
strong support of Senators FEINSTEIN 
and PADILLA, her home State Senators. 
Judge Ohta’s family immigrated to 
the United States from South Korea 
when she was young, and she grew up 
in New York City before attending 
Yale University and New York Univer-
sity School of Law. If confirmed, Judge 
Ohta would be the first Asian-Amer-
ican woman to serve on the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the Southern District of 
California. Judge Ohta’s wide-ranging 
legal experience makes her exception-
ally well qualified to be a district court 
judge. 
Next is David Urias, nominated to 
the District of New Mexico. Mr. Urias 
is a highly skilled litigator who is well 
versed in a number of practice areas, 
including criminal law, civil rights 
law, election law, and immigration. He 
also has experience representing a 
broad range of clients, from families of 
victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, to 
hedge fund managers, to plaintiffs from 
low-income backgrounds. 
In addition to having the strong sup-
port of his home State Senators—Sen-
ators HEINRICH and LUJA´ N—Mr. Urias 
has been rated unanimously ‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the ABA. Given Mr. 
Urias’s broad expertise and his experi-
ence representing a wide range of cli-
ents, he understands the importance of 
ensuring that every voice is fairly 
heard in our Nation’s courts. 
Next is Judge Maame Frimpong, 
nominated to the Central District of 
California. Judge Frimpong currently 
serves as a Superior Court judge in Los 
Angeles County. During her time on 
the Superior Court, she has presided 
over approximately 30 jury trials and 
thousands of hearings in misdemeanor 
and felony matters. In this role, Judge 
Frimpong has demonstrated the acu-
men and temperament that is required 
of our Nation’s judges. And she is yet 
another example of both the profes-
sional and demographic diversity that 
President Biden’s nominees are adding 
to our Federal courts. 
The ABA has unanimously rated 
Judge Frimpong ‘‘well qualified’’ to 
serve as a district court judge. Judge 
Frimpong has the strong support of her 
home State Senators—Senators FEIN-
STEIN and PADILLA—and she has my 
support as well. 
We also will consider Judge Jane 
Beckering’s nomination to the Western 
District of Michigan. Judge Beckering 
has served as a judge on the Michigan 
Court of Appeals since 2007. Prior to as-
suming the bench, she spent 17 years as 
a litigator in private practice, where 
she appeared regularly in both State 
and Federal courts and tried three jury 
trials to verdict. 
In reviewing her record, I am particu-
larly impressed by Judge Beckering’s 
judicial approach. She has stated, ‘‘My 
judicial 
philosophy 
is 
that 
judges 
should take off their partisan hats 
when they sit on the bench and treat 
all comers fairly and impartially . . . 
they should make their rulings based 
on the rule of law, not on a political 
agenda.’’ 
That is exactly the perspective we 
should be looking for in nominees to 
the Federal bench. Judge Beckering re-
ceived a unanimous ‘‘well qualified’’ 
rating from the ABA and has the 
strong support of her home State Sen-
ators, Senators STABENOW and PETERS. 
Next is Judge Shalina Kumar for the 
Eastern District of Michigan. Judge 
Kumar has served on the Sixth Judicial 
Circuit for Oakland County, MI, since 
2007. She is currently the chief judge on 
this court—the second largest trial 
court in Michigan—and served in this 
role on a temporary basis beginning in 
2010, 8 years before her official appoint-
ment. Over the past 14 years, she has 
presided over more than 10,000 cases 
and approximately 100 jury or bench 
trials on civil, criminal, and juvenile 
matters. Before joining the bench, 
Judge Kumar was a skilled litigator. 
Given her long and distinguished ca-
reer as a State court judge and her liti-
gation experience, it is unsurprising 
that Judge Kumar received a unani-
mous rating of ‘‘well qualified’’ from 
the American Bar Association. She 
likewise has the strong support of Sen-
ators STABENOW and PETERS. Once con-
firmed, she will also be the first Fed-
eral judge of South Asian descent to 
serve in Michigan. 
We will also vote on Judge Jennifer 
Thurston’s nomination to the Eastern 
District of California. Since 2009, Judge 
Thurston has served as a magistrate 
judge for the Eastern District of Cali-
fornia. And last year, she was elevated 
to the position of chief magistrate 
judge. She has presided over at least 30 
trials and 400 bench trials, and she has 
issued hundreds of judgments involving 
a range of issues, including civil rights, 
voting rights, employment discrimina-
tion, and criminal cases. 
Given Judge Thurston’s experience as 
a long-time jurist, she will be ready 
from day one to take on the challenges 
of the Eastern District of California, 
which has one of the highest caseloads 
in the country. Judge Thurston was 
rated unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ by 
the American Bar Association. And she 
has the strong support of her home 
State Senators, Senators FEINSTEIN 
and PADILLA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9286 
December 17, 2021 
We will also be voting on Judge Kate 
Menendez’s nomination to the District 
of Minnesota. Judge Menendez has 
served the District of Minnesota as a 
Federal magistrate judge since 2016. 
She was appointed to that role by the 
district’s sitting Federal judges, a re-
flection of Judge Menendez’s record, 
qualifications, and dedication to im-
partiality. 
Before assuming the bench, Judge 
Menendez served for nearly two dec-
ades as a Federal public defender, gain-
ing considerable trial and appellate ex-
perience. Importantly, she has dem-
onstrated that she understands the dif-
ference between the role of an advocate 
and that of a judge. She received a 
unanimous rating of ‘‘well qualified’’ 
from the American Bar Association 
and has the strong support of Senators 
KLOBUCHAR and SMITH. 
We will also consider the nomination 
of Judge Mary Katherine Dimke for the 
Eastern District of Washington. For 
nearly 6 years, Judge Dimke has served 
as a U.S. magistrate judge in the East-
ern District of Washington, based in 
Yakima, WA. In this role, Judge Dimke 
has presided over hundreds of matters, 
including approximately 400 civil cases 
that have gone to verdict or judgment. 
Prior to assuming the bench, Judge 
Dimke, a first-generation college grad-
uate, spent her legal career as a Fed-
eral prosecutor. During this time, she 
prosecuted a wide range of crimes, with 
a particular focus on fraud and com-
plex financial crimes. The ABA has 
unanimously rated Judge Dimke ‘‘well 
qualified’’ to serve as a district court 
judge, and she has the strong support 
of her home State Senators, Senators 
MURRAY and CANTWELL. 
Finally, we have Judge Gabriel San-
chez, nominated to a California seat on 
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Judge Sanchez is an experienced liti-
gator and appellate jurist with a prov-
en track record of impartial, even-
handed decision-making. 
He received his undergraduate and 
law degrees from Yale and a master’s 
degree 
from 
Cambridge 
University. 
After graduating, he clerked for Judge 
Richard A. Paez on the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Sanchez worked as a civil liti-
gator in private practice for 5 years be-
fore serving in the California State 
government, where he advised then- 
Governor Jerry Brown on litigation, 
legislation, appointments, and various 
policy measures, including criminal 
justice reform. 
For example, he helped California de-
velop and implement a response to a 
2011 Supreme Court holding ordering 
the State to reduce its prison popu-
lation. He served admirably to ensure 
California met its constitutional obli-
gations while also prioritizing public 
safety. In 2018, Judge Sanchez was ap-
pointed to serve on the California 
Court of Appeal, First Appellate Dis-
trict. The court has appellate jurisdic-
tion over virtually all final judgments 
and orders issued by 12 counties in 
California. 
During his time on the bench, Judge 
Sanchez has filed or joined in nearly 
500 opinions in cases almost evenly 
split between civil and criminal mat-
ters. So his judicial experience has 
been broad and varied. Judge Sanchez 
also has the strong support of his home 
State 
Senators—Senators 
FEINSTEIN 
and PADILLA—and was rated unani-
mously ‘‘well qualified’’ by the ABA. 
He is an exceptional nominee with im-
peccable credentials, and his even-
handed approach to justice will serve 
him well on the Ninth Circuit. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
these outstanding judicial nominees. 
Every one of them has been rated ‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the American Bar Asso-
ciation. They will bring much-needed 
professional and demographic diversity 
to the bench. They will be impartial 
and evenhanded in the administration 
of justice. And they will always be 
faithful to the rule of law. 
NOMINATION OF MARY KATHERINE DIMKE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
urge my colleagues to confirm Judge 
Kit Dimke for a district court vacancy 
in the Eastern District of Washington. 
To begin, I want to thank President 
Biden for nominating Judge Dimke for 
this 
position 
at 
my 
strong 
rec-
ommendation. At the start of this Con-
gress, there were six Federal district 
court vacancies in Washington State— 
six. More than half the Federal bench 
in Washington State was empty. Those 
vacancies put a huge strain on our Fed-
eral courts, but thanks to the quick 
work 
of 
this 
Senate 
with 
Judge 
Dimke’s confirmation, there will be 
just two, with another nominee voted 
out of committee just yesterday. 
We have confirmed more than 30 cir-
cuit and district judges to lifetime ap-
pointments and I could not be prouder 
that, once we confirm Judge Dimke, 
four of them will serve Washington 
State. In this Congress, we have sent a 
clear message that the judicial system 
belongs to the American people, and it 
should work for all of the American 
people, not just the powerful and well- 
connected. 
We are delivering on that commit-
ment by appointing Federal judges who 
reflect the diversity of our commu-
nities and who bring important profes-
sional diversity that has been missing 
from our courts for too long. Just this 
Congress, we have confirmed to the 
Federal bench in my State Lauren 
King, a respected Tribal law expert and 
Washington State’s first Native Amer-
ican Federal judge; Tana Lin, a civil 
rights lawyer, the first former public 
defender, and the first Asian-American 
Federal judge in my home State; David 
Estudillo, the son of immigrants, a re-
spected State court judge, and a former 
immigration attorney. And soon, I 
hope this Senate will vote to confirm 
Judge Kit Dimke. 
Judge Dimke is currently a Federal 
magistrate judge for the Eastern Dis-
trict of Washington. She knows the 
current judges and the lay of the land 
well, having served in that role since 
2016, and is a highly respected judicial 
colleague. Given her current role, she 
has meaningful experience in both 
criminal and civil Federal litigation. 
Judge Dimke’s entire career has been 
in 
public 
service; 
she 
previously 
worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney 
in both the Eastern and Western Dis-
tricts of Washington. A native of Wash-
ington State, she grew up in rural 
Asotin County as the child of a cattle 
ranger and lumber mill owner; she 
knows 
Eastern 
Washington. 
Judge 
Dimke attended the Running Start 
program at Walla Walla Community 
College in high school and went on to 
obtain her undergraduate degree from 
Pepperdine University and law degree 
from Vanderbilt. She is someone with a 
proven track record who is committed 
to improving access to the court and 
will look for ways for the court to 
work equitably for all participants and 
for each voice to be heard. 
Judge 
Dimke 
has 
already 
dem-
onstrated that commitment as a mag-
istrate judge, having worked to expand 
the court’s mediation services, im-
proved and diversified the court’s indi-
gent defense services, and more quick-
ly resolved one of the top areas of liti-
gation that the Eastern District sees— 
Social Security disability appeals. She 
participates in the court’s Judicial In-
stitute, 
volunteering 
to 
judge 
the 
court’s civics competitions for stu-
dents. And she is actively engaged in 
the court’s external outreach regarding 
the crisis missing and murdered Native 
American and Indigenous women, a sig-
nificant and serious problem facing 
Tribal 
communities 
in 
Washington 
State. 
Bottom line, Judge Dimke is quali-
fied to become a Federal district court 
judge and will make an excellent addi-
tion to the Federal bench from the 
Spokane Courthouse. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting to confirm 
her today.

NOMINATIONS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to talk about some nominees 
and how important it is to keep ad-
vancing nominees. 
A President should be able to have 
his Ambassadors in place so we can 
deal with the rest of the world, and we 
have key people who are still missing 
from Agencies, many of whom got 
through committees with strong bipar-
tisan support. Let me start with one of 
them. 
Today, I rise to discuss the impor-
tance of the Senate swiftly confirming 
Alan 
Davidson, 
one 
of 
President 
Biden’s very important nominees to 
the Department of Commerce. If con-
firmed, he will play a crucial role in 
the coming months and years in mak-
ing sure every American has access to 
reliable, affordable internet. 
Mr. Davidson has been nominated to 
be the Assistant Secretary for Commu-
nications and Information at the De-
partment 
of 
Commerce’s 
National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration, 
NTIA. 
OK. 
That 
sounds like a lot of words, but what 
does it really mean? 
As head of the NTIA, Mr. Davidson 
will oversee the distribution of the $40 
billion for broadband infrastructure 
funding coming out of our bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. So his job couldn’t 
be more important as we look at pro-
viding high-speed internet to every cor-
ner of this country. He will also play 
an important role in expanding wire-
less internet networks, promoting fair 
competition in the digital sector, and 
ensuring every American has access to 
affordable and fast internet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9288 
December 17, 2021 
As you know, after months of nego-
tiations between Democrats and Re-
publicans, this Senate came together 
to pass the President’s bipartisan in-
frastructure law, making a once-in-a- 
generation 
investment 
to 
improve 
roads, rail systems, and public transit, 
address climate change by updating 
our power grid, and, yes, invest in 
high-speed internet. 
It is the largest investment our coun-
try has ever made in high-speed inter-
net. I was proud to lead in the Senate 
the base bill—Representative CLYBURN 
led it in the House—to make this hap-
pen when it comes to broadband. 
Affordable and reliable internet ac-
cess is more important now than ever 
as students and families rely on the 
internet to learn or work from home, 
access telehealth services, and stay 
connected to loved ones. 
As 42 million Americans, including 16 
percent of households in rural Min-
nesota, lack reliable broadband access, 
the need to make the promises of this 
law a reality could not be more urgent. 
As head of the NTIA, Mr. Davidson will 
be responsible for overseeing the roll-
out of funding for broadband grants 
across the country. We don’t want to 
wait. We need someone who knows 
what he is doing in place now. 
With more than two decades of expe-
rience in the public and private sector 
as an executive, someone who worked 
in technology, and as an attorney, it is 
clear Mr. Davidson is ready for this 
job. 
He served in the Department of Com-
merce during the Obama administra-
tion, where he was the Department’s 
first Director of Digital Economy. His 
background in privacy and internet 
policy will be invaluable. I am con-
fident he will protect consumers, pro-
mote competition, and make this his-
toric law meaningful for everyday 
Americans. 
His nomination has earned support 
from a broad array of organizations, in-
cluding the Chamber of Commerce, the 
National Consumers League, the Open 
Technology Institute, and more than 80 
others. 
I should also point out that eight 
former heads of the NTIA, Republicans 
and Democrats alike, have urged the 
Senate to confirm Mr. Davidson. And 
he did very well in the committee. He 
came out of the committee with bipar-
tisan support. 
To me, this should just be done like 
this. We should just get it done 
through this Chamber, but we wait 
through this morass of rules. Instead of 
making the rules easier so we can re-
store the Senate so we can actually de-
bate issues, we literally spend hours 
and hours and hours and hours on 
nominees who received Republican sup-
port in the committee because one per-
son decides, well, I am going to hold 
that one up. 
We need to get this done now because 
while we wait, students, parents, and 
workers without high-speed internet 
are falling behind. I have heard too 
many stories, as I know every Senator 
in this chamber has heard, about peo-
ple from our States who have jumped 
through hoops just to get online. 
One high school student in Otter Tail 
County, MN, had such weak internet at 
her house that she always had to drive 
to the parking lot of a liquor store to 
take her online biology quizzes. I met 
her mom. She told me the story her-
self. I have also heard from rural doc-
tors who rely on the WiFi in McDon-
ald’s parking lots to read their pa-
tients’ x rays when they are outside 
the office on weekends. That is just un-
acceptable. So we need to make sure 
that this historic broadband funding 
gets out the door and that we have 
someone in place to administer it. 
In addition to this hugely important 
work, Mr. Davidson will also be respon-
sible for implementing upgrades to our 
9–1–1 system. In a crisis, no one should 
be put in danger because of outdated 9– 
1–1 systems, and first responders, pub-
lic safety officials, and law enforce-
ment must be able to communicate 
seamlessly. 
As a member of the Senate Com-
merce Committee and as one of the 
chairs of the Congressional Next Gen-
eration 9–1–1 Caucus, I know that these 
upgrades are urgently needed to help 
move the country’s largely outdated 9– 
1–1 call centers and related technology 
into the digital age. We need to enable 
9–1–1 call centers to handle text mes-
sages, pictures, videos, and other infor-
mation sent by smartphones, tablets, 
and other devices when faced with an 
emergency. Mr. Davidson, with his vast 
array of experience, will help to bring 
our 9–1–1 systems into the 21st century 
by providing State and local govern-
ments with the resources they need to 
update our emergency response net-
works and keep our communities safe. 
I urge my colleagues to support Mr. 
Davidson’s nomination today to move 
our country and our economy forward. 
The stakes are too high to wait. 
Mr. President, I also come to the 
floor today to speak on the many Am-
bassador nominees who are ready for a 
vote but are being held up by some of 
our colleagues on the other side. I em-
phasize ‘‘some’’ because many of these 
nominees got strong bipartisan sup-
port. 
While I appreciate the progress we 
are now making on some of the nomi-
nees as we speak, many have been 
waiting months for a vote. When we 
finish today—at least tonight or when 
we finish in the next few days—more, 
we know, will still be waiting because 
we have well over 100 people who have 
been waiting for a vote, over 150 people 
waiting for a vote. 
This unnecessary delay is sabotaging 
our 
diplomatic 
efforts 
around 
the 
world. The State Department is made 
up of some of the best, the brightest, 
and the most patriotic citizens. By fail-
ing to confirm Ambassadors, whether 
to Iraq—we know how important that 
is—Equatorial Guinea, or Japan, we 
are hurting not only the nominees and 
our Foreign Service officers but also 
all those who look to America as a bea-
con of democracy. 
First, let’s look at Elizabeth Moore 
Aubin, who was nominated to be Am-
bassador to Algeria in April and was 
reported out of the committee in 
June—June—the beginning of summer. 
We are now in the middle of winter. 
Algeria is an important partner in 
northern Africa when it comes to eco-
nomic and strategic security issues. 
Aubin is clearly up to the task. She 
previously served as the Assistant Sec-
retary for the Bureau of Near Eastern 
Affairs and served as the Deputy Chief 
of Mission in Algiers, Algeria, during a 
2013 terrorist attack. 
Aubin knows from her years at the 
State Department and from her first-
hand experience what it takes to keep 
Americans safe overseas. Yet she has 
been held up for 6 months. Americans 
and Americans in Algeria deserve bet-
ter. 
Angola. Another Ambassador who 
has 
been 
waiting 
since 
June 
is 
Tulinabo Mushingi, who has been nom-
inated to serve as Ambassador to An-
gola and several other islands off the 
coast of eastern Africa. He has already 
served as Ambassador and Deputy 
Chief of Mission to our Embassy in 
Ethiopia, so he will be ready to take on 
this role on day 1. 
Through our country’s partnership 
with the Angolan Government, we have 
made significant progress in removing 
thousands of landmines and advancing 
economic growth in the region. The 
United States and Angola will be bet-
ter served with an experienced Ambas-
sador, and he should be confirmed 
promptly. 
Yet that is not all. We also must 
move 
forward 
with 
Claire 
Cronin, 
whom President Biden nominated to be 
the Ambassador to Ireland. Cronin was 
the first woman to serve as the Massa-
chusetts House majority leader and the 
first woman to chair the Massachusetts 
House Judiciary Committee. President 
Biden nominated her in June, 6 months 
ago, and she advanced from committee 
nearly 2 months ago, in mid-October. 
Ireland is an economic partner, a se-
curity partner, and, of course, the 
United States is home to many proud 
Irish Americans. 
We need Ambassador Cronin to move 
forward. 
I know we are making progress, but I 
think of a country like Japan, where 
Rahm Emanuel has been nominated— 
Japan. 
My good friend, whom we lost this 
year, Vice President Mondale, was the 
Ambassador to Japan, and I remember 
how proud they were when he got voted 
through and went to Japan. They were 
so proud that the United States of 
America sent an ambassador to their 
country, someone of great experience. 
This is the case of all these Ambas-
sador nominees. Our country deserves 
to have people over there representing 
our Nation. You think they don’t no-
tice, these countries?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9289 
December 17, 2021 
As I said, we are making progress. 
Today or tomorrow, we may vote to 
confirm Denise Campbell Bauer, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to serve as Am-
bassador to France. Bauer was nomi-
nated in July, 5 months ago, and is 
only now coming to the floor for a 
vote. She served as Ambassador to Bel-
gium, including during the 2016 ter-
rorist attack in Brussels. She is well 
qualified for this role. 
France is our oldest ally and friend, 
and while we may be making progress, 
I am deeply concerned that our Repub-
lican colleagues have needlessly de-
layed this post. 
I urge my friends on the other side of 
the aisle to lift their hold on these Am-
bassadors and the dozens of other 
qualified, dedicated nominees. 
We know there are negotiations afoot 
that we can move forward. Let’s get a 
bunch of these done. 
The United States must be able to 
have strong people in place for our al-
lies to deal with problems overseas and 
to represent proudly the United States 
of America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

(Mr. 
KING). The clerk will call the roll.

unanimous consent that the order for

dered.

SENATOR PATRICK J. LEAHY’S 17,000TH VOTE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
just after the clock struck 12 midnight, 
we have a wonderful announcement: 
Senator 
LEAHY
has 
just 
cast 
his 
17,000th vote. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
Madam President, I would note one 
more thing. Robert C. Byrd is the only 
Senator who has cast more votes than 
Senator LEAHY in the history of the

(Applause.) 
So we will have a 2-hour recess to 
celebrate. No, we are not doing that. 
(Laughter.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while 
the distinguished leader is still on the 
floor, I thank him for his comments. It 
is very late at night, and I will speak 
further about this next week. 
I must admit, when I came here as 
the junior-most Member of the Senate, 
I did not expect to be in this position, 
but I have had the privilege now of 
serving with slightly over 20 percent of 
all of the Senators who have served in 
the history of this country, and some 
were very, very good Senators—and all 
were Senators. All were Senators, and 
some were very good. 
(Laughter.) 
I will speak about this later in the 
week. I appreciate the comments, and 
it has been a privilege serving with all 
of those hundreds and hundreds of Sen-
ators I have served with. 
Thank you.

ator from Illinois.

TRIBUTE TO OFFICER RODERICK 
JENNINGS 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an exceptional Amer-
ican and an exceptional member of the 
U.S. Capitol Police Force, Officer Rod-
erick Jennings. Officer Jennings is re-
tiring from the U.S. Capitol Police on 
December 28, 2021, after 31 years of 
service, and today, I wanted to take a 
moment to honor his years of service 
to the U.S. Capitol Police and to our 
country. 
While he has served in many roles 
during his tenure, Officer Jennings 
most recently has been assigned to the 
U.S. Capitol Police Senate Division. I 
would often see him stationed in the 
basement of the Russell Senate Office 
Building, as well as other locations 
throughout the Senate complex. When-
ever I saw Officer Jennings, he was al-
ways friendly and consistently main-
tained 
a 
sense 
of 
utmost 
profes-
sionalism. I always enjoyed seeing him 
throughout my day, and I know other 
members and staff feel the same. The 
Senate community will miss Officer 
Jennings. 
We must do everything we can to 
support and honor our law enforcement 
officers for what they do for us each 
and every day. The Capitol Police 
make tremendous sacrifices and put 
their lives on the line for us, and for 
that, we owe them a debt of gratitude. 
Officer Jennings showed an unwavering 
commitment to keeping others safe, 
and these halls undoubtedly remained 
safer because of his service and the en-
tire Capitol Police force. Officer Jen-
nings represents everything that is 
great about our country, and we are all 
better off for his selfless sense of duty 
and his tireless commitment to our 
safety. I thank Officer Jennings for his

REMEMBERING COLIN POWELL 
Mr. REED. Mr. President. I rise 
today to honor one of our Nation’s 
most distinguished and honorable mili-
tary and diplomatic leaders, Colin 
Powell. 
Few American leaders have served 
their nation more, from combat over-
seas as a young officer to the heights of 
military command and diplomacy on 
the world stage. Colin Powell will and 
should hold a renowned place in our 
country’s history. 
Throughout his life, Colin Powell was 
the epitome of selfless service and cou-
rageous leadership. He gave everything 
he had to America—and then some. 
And he always did what many profess 
but few do: He took responsibility. 
Colin Powell was a trailblazer for 
countless Americans. He paved much of 
the way on his own. Raised in the 
South Bronx as the son of Jamaican 
immigrants, he joined ROTC at the 
City College of New York and went on 
to serve with incredible bravery in 
Vietnam, sustaining wounds on two 
tours and saving the lives of many fel-
low soldiers. Colin Powell’s remarkable 
skill as a military commander was 
clear to everyone around him, and he 
rose quickly through the ranks, even-
tually becoming National Security Ad-
visor to President Ronald Reagan and, 
later, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff for President George H.W. Bush. 
The ‘‘Powell Doctrine,’’ as his theory 
of warfare would become known, guid-
ed the United States to its most deci-
sive military victory since World War 
II through Operation Desert Storm. 
Colin Powell insisted that war should 
be the last resort in any national con-
flict, but, when necessary, it should be 
focused, overwhelming for the enemy, 
and controlled with clear objectives. 
We would do well to remember that vi-
sion today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9301 
December 17, 2021 
Colin Powell reached the summit of 
his career when he was named Sec-
retary of State for President George W. 
Bush. Once again, he served his coun-
try selflessly and demonstrated his in-
nate decency and integrity. 
A distinct honor of my life was the 
opportunity to work with and learn 
from Colin Powell in the years after-
ward. I made a point to call him when 
I was named chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. His advice 
was deeply appreciated. Indeed, both in 
and out of uniform, he advised genera-
tions of Presidents, diplomats, military 
leaders, and lawmakers with wisdom 
and candor. Colin did not shrink from 
the truth, and he will be remembered 
as one of our Nation’s most thoughtful 
strategists. 
Perhaps most importantly, to the 
countless Americans who looked up to 
him, Colin Powell leaves a legacy of 
courage and integrity. He was the first 
leader of color in many of the land’s 
highest offices, including National Se-
curity Advisor, Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State. 
He was beloved by his troops, respected 
by his peers, and trusted more than 
any other American of his day. 
Colin Powell was resolute and honor-
able throughout his life and career, and 
America is fortunate to have benefited 
from his leadership. I offer my sincere 
condolences to Alma and his wonderful 
family, whom I know he loved deeply 
and fiercely. 
May we all strive for the wisdom, 
courage, and humility that Colin Pow-
ell imparted upon this great Nation. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO STAFF 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as this 
year draws to a close, I rise today to 
recognize my staff and their exemplary 
service to Pennsylvania in the face of 
immense challenges. Even under the 
best of circumstances, public service 
can be challenging work. For the past 
2 years my staff have, like all Ameri-
cans, grappled with the daunting un-
certainty and isolation wrought by the 
COVID–19 pandemic and grief for the 
more than 800,000 lives lost. 
Despite these difficulties, they have 
risen to the demands of the moment to 
support, advocate for, and empower the 
people of Pennsylvania. The end of the 
year is a time for reflection on all that 
we have overcome and an opportunity 
to express gratitude for those we hold 
dear. This December, I would like to 
express my gratitude for the men and 
women who have served in my office— 
some of whom have since moved on— 
and their indelible contributions to the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during 
such an extraordinary time. 
I am grateful for my administrative 
staff, who build and maintain the solid 
foundation on which an effective con-
gressional office is built. These are the 
people who tirelessly ensure that ev-
eryone on our team has the support 
and resources needed to do their jobs 
effectively. While the work that they 
do may not be noticeable to everyone, 
they are truly the connective tissue 
which allows the rest of the office to 
function. 
Similarly, the office’s executive staff 
are tasked with ensuring my time is 
used as efficiently as possible and that 
my day runs smoothly. From building 
schedules that balance constituent en-
gagements, committee hearings, floor 
votes, and travel; to managing the flur-
ry of briefing memos on any given day 
and drafting my constituent greetings, 
I could not be nearly as effective on be-
half of the people of Pennsylvania 
without their hard work. 
It is impossible to overstate the im-
portance of the work of the constituent 
services team, who walk with constitu-
ents in their darkest moments in pur-
suit of a brighter resolution. Day in 
and day out, these are the men and 
women who help Pennsylvania seniors 
navigate issues with Social Security 
checks, help veterans secure benefits 
owed to them and medals they have 
earned, among so many other things. 
During COVID, they have continued to 
assist with routine cases while also 
working tirelessly to connect Penn-
sylvanians with testing and other re-
sources, apply for small business relief, 
navigate unemployment systems, and 
so much more. 
The outreach staff, spread out over 
seven 
offices 
across 
the 
Common-
wealth, serve as a vital resource in en-
suring the needs of all 67 counties are 
met. These individuals are my liaisons 
to local communities across Pennsyl-
vania, representing me in their regions 
every single day. Throughout the pan-
demic, they have been in constant con-
tact with local elected officials, shar-
ing information back and forth and 
bringing to bear Federal resources 
when they have been needed most. 
Their relationships across the Com-
monwealth, and their granular knowl-
edge of communities large and small 
are extraordinary. I am grateful for in-
numerable phone calls and meetings 
that they lead and attend every year 
and the thousands of miles that they 
drive as they crisscross their regions to 
show up for the communities they rep-
resent. 
The legislative staff fight daily for 
policies that will improve life for every 
American, but especially those who are 
too often overlooked and left behind. 
These men and women bring their ex-
pertise to bear to help inform my pol-
icy positions and floor votes. In an-
swering 
constituent 
correspondence, 
they parse through complex matters of 
policy to help constituents better un-
derstand how critical legislation will 
impact Pennsylvania. I am deeply 
grateful for the benefit of their ex-
traordinary minds and their dedication 
to improving the lives of working fami-
lies with sound policy. 
It is through the tireless work of the 
communications staff that Pennsylva-
nians 
understand 
how 
I 
am 
rep-
resenting them in Washington. These 
men and women are a vital bridge be-
tween the work that I do in the Senate 
and the people of Pennsylvania, help-
ing me connect the voices of the Com-
monwealth to the halls of Congress, 
and in turn bringing our legislative 
work back into communities across 
Pennsylvania. 
Since 2017, I have had the privilege of 
serving as the lead Democrat on the 
Senate Special Committee on Aging. 
During the pandemic, this team has re-
lentlessly 
demanded 
accountability 
from the programs and institutions 
that serve older adults and people with 
disabilities. As COVID devastated nurs-
ing homes, they pushed for increased 
transparency to protect residents and 
workers. They now lead the call for 
transformative investments in life- 
changing home and community-based 
services. 
There is an inscription on the Fi-
nance Building in Harrisburg, PA, that 
has guided me during my time as a 
public official. It reads: ‘‘All public 
service is a trust, given in faith and ac-
cepted in honor.’’ Each and every day, 
my staff demonstrate their commit-
ment to that trust with tireless work 
and personal sacrifice. They are hard- 
working and talented individuals who 
form a distinguished collective of hon-
orable public servants whom I respect 
and whom I am grateful to work along-
side. 
Today, I am proud to list them alpha-
betically by name to memorialize their 
service to our Commonwealth and our 
country during this pandemic:

TRIBUTE TO ERIN STUART 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize a member of 
my staff, Erin Stuart, who left the of-
fice in July to attend law school at 
Marquette University. This is an excit-
ing time in Erin’s life and all of us with 
Team Sullivan want to thank her for 
her contributions to our office, the 
State of Alaska, and the U.S. Senate. 
Erin is a born-and-raised Alaskan 
who grew up fishing with her family in 
our State’s pristine waters. After grad-
uating from South Anchorage High 
School, Erin attended the University of 
Portland where she explored her pas-
sions for government affairs and trade 
policy. 
Erin’s time on Capitol Hill began in 
the summer of 2018 when she was an in-
tern for my colleague, Congressman 
DON YOUNG. That following summer, 
Erin joined my DC office where she im-
pressed all of us with her strong work 
ethic, eventually becoming a legisla-
tive 
correspondent 
for 
healthcare 
issues. 
We work tirelessly in my office to en-
sure that the needs of Alaskans are 
best represented. I tell people who join 
my staff that it is not easy work. Erin 
was always eager to learn and to give 
the job her all, while also spending her 
evenings and weekends studying for 
the LSAT and filling out law school ap-
plications. 
We wish her the best as she begins 
this new chapter in her life. 
While Erin is currently not on my 
staff, she is will always be a member of 
Team Sullivan. Please join me in wish-
ing Erin success in her future. She is 
missed.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DAVID TOMASSONI 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise to honor Minnesota State 
Senator David Tomassoni, a public 
servant, Olympian, and friend. Even

Disease—also known as ALS—he has 
continued to serve the people of his dis-
trict on Minnesota’s Iron Range. 
David’s family has a distinctly Amer-
ican story: His grandfather was an im-
migrant, and his father served in World 
War II. And David, a son of Chisholm, 
MN, attended Denver University on a 
full hockey scholarship before embark-
ing on a professional hockey career 
that brought him to Italy and the 
Olympics. He then returned to the 
place he was so proud to call home: the 
Iron Range. As David is quick to re-
mind anyone, the Range ‘‘provided the 
ore that has forged the steel that has 
made the bridges of America.’’ 
Northern Minnesota was also where 
David found his true calling as a legis-
lator. In nearly three decades of public 
service in the Minnesota House of Rep-
resentatives and State senate, David 
has represented his community with 
pride, working every day to deliver real 
results for workers and families. From 
bringing good-paying jobs to his dis-
trict, to improving schools, to fighting 
for safe conditions for miners, he has 
always been driven by a commitment 
to making his constituents’ lives bet-
ter. 
When David announced his ALS diag-
nosis, it sent a shock through the en-
tire State senate, and his colleagues 
rushed to wish him encouragement and 
good health. But even in the face of his 
own illness—and in true Tomassoni 
fashion—he is still thinking of others. 
He is planning to introduce legislation 
to invest in new research, care, and ul-
timately a cure for ALS. He knows he 
likely will not be able to benefit from 
that investment himself, but the possi-
bility that he could help another per-
son is enough for him. 
I want to leave you with David’s own 
words, from the letter he shared with 
his constituents about his ALS diag-
nosis. He wrote: ‘‘I give you my word 
that my brain and my body will con-
tinue to represent you with the same 
passion and vigor I’ve tried to give in 
the past. I have been fortunate and 
blessed in my life, my career, in sports, 
and with friends and a great family. 
This is the next challenge.’’ 
David, you are an inspiration, not 
just to me, but to anyone who values 
hard work and determination. Thank 
you for your decades of service to the 
people of our great State, and my 
thoughts and best wishes are with you. 
If anyone is up to this challenge, it is 
you.∑

TRIBUTE TO JANIS SANTOS 
∑ Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I would 
like to offer my congratulations to 
Janis Santos as she retires as CEO 
from 
Holyoke 
Chicopee 
Springfield 
Head Start after 48 years of leadership 
in early childhood education and care. 
She deserves recognition for her stead-
fast commitment to ensuring that chil-
dren of all backgrounds have access to 
high-quality early education. 
A graduate of Holyoke Community 
College and the University of Massa-
chusetts, Janis began her professional 
teaching career in western Massachu-
setts. She soon became a trailblazer in 
her field. After opening Parkside Early 
Learning Center in Ludlow in 1973, she 
went on to join Holyoke Chicopee Head 
Start, Inc., as executive director in 
1979. She continues to lead Holyoke 
Chicopee Springfield Head Start, which 
has grown to be the second largest 
Head Start Agency in Massachusetts 
and one of the largest providers of 
early education in western Massachu-
setts. In her career with Head Start, 
she has held several leadership posi-
tions, including chair of the Massachu-
setts Head Start Directors Association, 
chair of the New England Head Start 
Association, vice chair of the National 
Head Start Association, and member of 
the national advisory panel for the 
Head Start 2010 Project. 
In 2003, while serving on the board of 
directors of the National Head Start 
Association, she testified before the 
Senate Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions in a hear-
ing on the reauthorization of funds for 
Head Start. Her advocacy on behalf of 
the children and families in Head Start 
programs is powerfully important. I 
want to offer my gratitude to Janis 
Santos for her lifelong commitment to 
America’s children and for all she has 
done to advance early childhood edu-
cation and care in the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts. I congratulate her on

Gail S. Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans 
Center’’.

proceeded to consider the measure.

sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 2514) was ordered to be

S. 2514 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE COL. GAIL S. 
HALVORSEN ‘‘CANDY BOMBER’’ VET-
ERANS CENTER. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Gail Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, on October 10, 1920, and spent his 
youth with his family on small farms in 
Utah and Idaho. 
(2) After a brief stint at Utah State Univer-
sity, Gail Halvorsen joined the Civilian Pilot 
Training Program where he earned his pi-
lot’s license in 1941. During that same year, 
Halvorsen joined the Civil Air Patrol as a 
pilot. 
(3) Gail Halvorsen joined the United States 
Army Air Corps in 1942 and trained flying 
fighter jets with the Royal Air Force. Upon 
his return from training, he was assigned to 
fly transport missions in the South Atlantic 
Theater. 
(4) After World War II and the division of 
Berlin into occupation zones, disputes broke 
out between the Western Allies and the So-
viet Union over the future of Europe. 
(5) Negotiations deteriorated, and in June 
of 1948 Soviet forces locked down all land 
routes connecting Western Germany with 
the allied portions of Berlin. Approximately 
2,000,000 people in West Berlin were left com-
pletely isolated. Starvation, poverty, and 
desperate want ensued. 
(6) In an effort to alleviate the immense 
human suffering, the allies decided to drop 
supplies to people of West Berlin from the air 
until a diplomatic solution to the blockade 
could be reached. Termed by United States 
forces ‘‘Operation Vittles’’, the Berlin Airlift 
began on June 26, 1948. 
(7) Gail Halvorsen was assigned to Ger-
many in 1948 to work as an airlift pilot 
where he flew C–47 and C–54 cargo planes as 
part of Operation Vittles. 
(8) While on mission at Tempelhof Airport 
in Berlin, Halvorsen noticed a group of Ger-
man children standing just outside the barb 
wire fence. 
(9) The children were destitute and clearly 
had very little to eat. Halvorsen gave the 
children two sticks of gum he had in his 
pocket, which they split into little pieces to 
share among themselves. 
(10) Colonel Halvorsen was deeply affected 
by the experience and wanted to do more to 
help. He promised the children he would drop 
more candy to them from his plane as he 
flew his regular airlift missions. 
(11) Halvorsen told the children they would 
recognize his plane by a back-and-forth wag-
gle of his wings as he flew over. 
(12) Colonel Halvorsen enlisted his copilot 
and engineer in the project and began at-
taching their candy rations to miniature 
parachutes which they dropped from their 
plane to the starving children below. 
(13) The children of Berlin gave Halvorsen 
many nicknames including ‘‘Uncle Wiggly 
Wings’’, ‘‘The Chocolate Flier’’, ‘‘The Gum 
Drop Kid’’, and ‘‘The Chocolate Uncle’’. He 
eventually became known around the world 
as ‘‘The Candy Bomber’’. 
(14) Lieutenant General William H. Turner, 
who directed the Berlin Airlift, learned 
about Halvorsen’s efforts and officially ex-
panded the idea into a full-blown operation 
known as ‘‘Little Vittles’’ as a play on the 
broader operation’s name. 
(15) As the candy drops continued, word of 
Operation Little Vittles reached the United 
States. Families, schoolchildren, and candy-
makers in the United States began contrib-
uting candy and homemade parachutes that 
Halvorsen and other pilots could drop. 
(16) When the Berlin Airlift ended, an esti-
mated 250,000 parachutes containing approxi-
mately 21 tons of candy had been dropped by 
Halvorsen and his fellow airmen as a part of 
Operation Little Vittles. 
(17) Halvorsen retired from the military in 
1974 after 31 years of service and more than 
8,000 hours of flying time. 
(18) Since his retirement, Halvorson has 
continued his humanitarian service. He has 
voluntarily represented the United States 
Air Force and the United States abroad and 
has re-enacted his famous candy drops sev-
eral times in Berlin and around the world. 
(19) Halvorsen has also been a tremendous 
boon to his community through church serv-
ice and other local contributions. 
(20) Gail Halvorsen turned 100 years old on 
October 10, 2020. 
(b) DESIGNATION.—The Provo Veterans Cen-
ter of the Department of Veterans Affairs lo-
cated at 360 State Street, Orem, Utah, shall 
after the date of the enactment of this Act 
be known and designated as the ‘‘Col. Gail S. 
Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center’’. 
(c) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the veterans 
center referred to in subsection (b) shall be 
considered to be a reference to the Col. Gail 
S. Halvorsen ‘‘Candy Bomber’’ Veterans Cen-
ter.
