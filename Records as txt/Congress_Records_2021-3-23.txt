PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, in You we trust and 
pray Your blessing on this House and 
its Members. In these first days of 
spring, may we see the example of new 
life emerging from the bleakest of sea-
sons, confident in Your care and sure of 
Your purpose. As trees planted by 
streams of water, may we extend our 
roots: ourselves, our energy, and our 
desires to the refreshment of Your life- 
giving spirit. 
And when the heat of our days in-
creases, and the schedule becomes 
withering, restore us with a reinvigo-
rated desire to serve You. 
When the storms of debate and dis-
agreements intensify, may we not 
throw ourselves into the path of the 
tempest, but live into the grace we re-
ceive from Your promises. 
And when the drought of certainty 
and the famine of significance seem to 
deplete us of any vestige of hope, re-
vive our faithfulness that we, in this 
season, may bear fruit for Your king-
dom. 
We offer this prayer in the strength 
of Your name. 
Amen.

The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who commands the 
morning to appear, we honor Your 
Holy Name. 
Lord, guide our lawmakers to find de-
light in Your guidance. May Your wis-
dom provide them with food for reflec-

their strength, as they seek for ways to 
reduce the violence in our land. 
Lord, provide them with uncommon 
wisdom to bring greater respect for the 
preciousness of each person made in 
Your image. Give us all a greater rev-
erence for the sanctity of every life.

COLORADO SHOOTINGS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
this morning the Nation grieves with 
the people of Boulder, CO, the site of 
another horrific mass shooting last 
night. A depraved gunman opened fire 
inside a local supermarket, killing 10 
people, including a police officer. Many 
more are injured. 
Our hearts go out to the people of 
Boulder and the families of those 
Americans who have lost their lives so 
unexpectedly. 
Our thanks again go out to the brave 
first responders. 
People kiss someone goodbye for the 
morning and send somebody off to 
school and they are never seen again— 
never seen again. It is just awful. And 
it has been less than 8 weeks since 
eight people were killed in another se-
ries of shootings in Georgia. We cannot 
seem to finish grieving one tragedy be-
fore another takes place. 
It is a reminder that we must con-
front a devastating truth in the United 
States: An unrelenting epidemic of gun 
violence steals innocent lives with 
alarming regularity. Even amidst the 
pandemic, gun violence has not re-
ceded. In fact, confoundedly, it has 
grown even worse, and 2020 was one of 
the deadliest years for gun violence in 
two decades—a reminder that most gun 
violence doesn’t even make headlines 
but nonetheless causes immeasurable 
devastation to communities from one 
end of our country to the other. 
So we have a lot of work to do. I have 
already committed to bringing uni-
versal background checks legislation 
to the floor of the Senate. There is a 
hearing today in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee under Chairman DURBIN’s 
leadership to examine several common-
sense proposals to reduce gun violence. 
Two summers ago, the Republican 
leader—then 
the 
majority 
leader— 
promised there would be a debate in 
the Senate on gun violence, but it 
never happened. It never happened. 
This Senate will be different. The 
Senate is going to debate and address

the epidemic of gun violence in this 
country. 
Today, our hearts are with the people 
of Colorado and with everyone whose 
lives have been touched by gun vio-
lence. 
f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIAN 
AMERICANS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
as I mentioned, the shooting in Colo-
rado comes only a week after another 
tragedy in the communities outside At-
lanta, GA, where eight people were 
killed in a string of shootings, six of 
whom were women of Asian descent. 
It is important to place the Atlanta 
area shootings in context. Over the 
past year, there has been a rising tide 
of violence against Asian Americans 
driven by fear, misinformation, and 
age-old prejudices against the Asian- 
American community, from shouted in-
sults and racial slurs to outright as-
sault. 
A 61-year-old Filipino American was 
slashed in the face by a box cutter on 
the New York subway. An 84-year-old 
Thai American in San Francisco was 
shoved so violently it led to his death. 
And now this attack in Georgia. 
Every day, Asian Americans walk 
down the streets looking over their 
shoulders, wondering if they will be as-
saulted or even worse—even worse. 
The poison of racism has always ex-
isted in America, but over the past 4 
years it seems to have found new life. 
There is no question that the former 
President Donald Trump, through word 
and deed, fanned the flames of racial 
bias in our country. It is not a coinci-
dence that it is worse now than it has 
been before. Donald Trump fanned 
those 
flames—fanned 
those 
flames, 
often with glee. 
With respect to the Asian-American 
community, specifically, the former 
President encouraged rhetoric that 
blamed the Chinese people for the 
coronavirus—an absolutely despicable 
notion that has led to all sorts of 
verbal and physical assaults on Asian 
Americans. You could see him with his 
chin strutted out when he called it the 
virus that he named it—you know 
what—the China virus. So despicable. 
And he did it with almost a joy. 
Here in America, we all know that an 
attack against any one group is an at-
tack against all of us. So it is up to all 
of us now to stand up and speak out in 
support of the Asian-American commu-
nity in America. 
Over the weekend, I joined several 
vigils to stand with Americans of all 
ages, races, and faiths to support the 
Asian-American community. There was 
a large turnout, and our Asian brothers 
and sisters were so relieved that so 
many of us from the elected commu-
nity were there. We should all be doing 
that in every part of the country. 
Here on the floor of the Senate this 
morning, I started the process to make 
two pieces of legislation available for 
action by the full Senate. 
First is a bill led by my friend Sen-
ator HIRONO of Hawaii, very similar to 
the same bill introduced by our New 
York Congress Member, GRACE MENG, 
of Queens. This legislation by Senator 
HIRONO
will 
address 
COVID-related 
hate crimes against Asian Americans 
head-on. It would assign a point person 
at the Department of Justice to expe-
dite the review of COVID–19-related 
hate crimes, provide support for State 
and local law enforcement agencies to 
respond to hate crimes, and work on 
solutions to the problem of racially 
discriminatory language that has been 
used to describe the pandemic. 
Second is a bill led by my friend Sen-
ator DURBIN to counter the threat of 
domestic terrorism and violent White 
supremacy. This is a bill that passed 
the House of Representatives last year 
on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. 
As far as legislation goes, it is as much 
of a no-brainer as it comes. 
Every one of us—every one of us—has 
an obligation to speak out against 
these hate crimes. One of the best anti-
dotes—there are many—but one of the 
best antidotes when hate occurs is to 
answer it forcefully, strongly, and re-
peatedly so that no one thinks it is ac-
ceptable, and those who perpetrate it 
are shunned and then, if they have bro-
ken the law, punished. 
Every one of us must do this. We 
must speak out. Here in the Senate, we 
have more than a responsibility to just 
speak out; we must take action. I hope 
we will have universal support for 
these pieces of legislation that I men-
tioned. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
while House Democrats try to overturn 
a certified election result from last No-
vember, some Senate Democrats are 
agitating to break Senate rules to ram 
through a partisan rewrite of all 50 
States’ election laws—all 50 States’ 
election laws. 
The 60-vote threshold is the reason 
huge pillars of domestic policy don’t 
oscillate back and forth every time a 
different party wins the majority. So 
let’s think of something like the Mex-
ico City policy, the executive branch 
policy about funding overseas abor-
tions. It has flipped back and forth 
every single time the White House has 
changed parties since the 1980s. Repub-
lican Presidents issue the memo; the 
Democratic Presidents retract it. 
The legislative filibuster is what 
keeps the entirety of Federal law from 
working that way. For a long time, 
Senators on both sides have recognized 
the Senate and the country are better 
off with some actual stability. Both 
sides have understood there are no per-
manent majorities in American poli-
tics, so a system that gives both sides 
a voice benefits, actually, everyone in 
the long term. 
That is what 33 of our Democratic 
colleagues said just a few years ago, 
when they all signed a joint letter in-
sisting that rules protecting debate on 
legislation be preserved. 
That is what President Biden be-
lieved consistently throughout his long 
Senate tenure. About 15 years ago, 
then-Senator Biden said killing the fil-
ibuster would be, ‘‘an example of the 
arrogance of power.’’ That was Presi-
dent Biden. He restated his long-held 
position during the campaign just last 
year. 
Here is what my colleague the Demo-
cratic leader said in 2017. Senator 
SCHUMER said: 
The legislative filibuster . . . is the most 
important distinction between the Senate 
and the House. . . . [L]et’s find a way to fur-
ther protect the 60-vote rule for legislation. 
That was the Democratic leader in 
2017. 
And Democrats didn’t just spend the 
last 4 years supporting the filibuster; 
they spent 4 years using it. Senate 
Democrats used the filibuster to kill 
Senator TIM SCOTT’s police reform bill 
in the wake of the deaths of George 
Floyd and Breonna Taylor. 
We could have had Federal legisla-
tion on the books since last summer, 
putting more body cameras on police 
officers, requiring fuller incident re-
porting to the FBI, and finally making 
lynching a Federal crime, among other 
things. Democrats stopped it. They 
stopped it using the filibuster. 
A few months before, they used the 
filibuster to briefly turn the bipartisan 
sprint toward the CARES Act into a 
partisan standoff. The press marveled 
that Senate Democrats had the gall to 
block relief—a tactic that helped tank 
the markets—in order to demand fur-
ther changes. 
Back in early 2018, Senate Democrats 
used the filibuster to block government 
funding and force a brief government 
shutdown over, of all things, immigra-
tion. One of the Democratic leader’s 
first major acts as the leader of his 
conference was to wield the filibuster 
to shut down the entire Federal Gov-
ernment. 
So, look, the Democratic side just 
spent 4 years defending and, of course, 
happily using the same Senate rule 
that many of our colleagues now at-
tack. So this reversal is not about prin-
ciple. It has nothing whatsoever to do 
with principle. It is just raw power— 
raw power.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1683 
March 23, 2021 
Three years ago, the assistant Demo-
cratic leader was asked about the Sen-
ate majority going ‘‘nuclear’’ and kill-
ing the legislative filibuster. Here’s 
what Senator DURBIN had to say: 
I can tell you that would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and cre-
ated going back to our Founding Fathers. 
That was Senator DURBIN in 2018, just 
a few years ago. Now he argues the op-
posite. 
Now I understand our colleague has 
rotated through several different expla-
nations for his reversal in just the last 
few days. 
First, our colleague from Illinois in-
dicated he changed his mind—changed 
his mind—because Republicans, and I 
specifically, had used the filibuster so 
much in the intervening years. But, 
Mr. President, Republicans were in the 
majority the whole time. We were in 
the majority the whole time. It was the 
Democrats who used the filibuster in 
the minority in 2018, 2019, and 2020—not 
Republicans. That argument makes no 
sense whatsoever. 
A few days later, there was a new 
made-up rationale: It is just that the 
Senate hasn’t been getting anything 
done, so the institution needs an over-
haul. Except we have just had a 
uniquely terrible year to make that ar-
gument. 
Last year was not a good year to 
make that argument. We passed five— 
five—bipartisan COVID bills with big 
bipartisan majorities that spent the 
most money in American history and 
helped save the country. Don’t see any 
obstruction in that. We passed a his-
toric bipartisan bill for national parks 
and public lands. Didn’t see any out-
rageous use of the filibuster on that. 
So there is fake history swirling all 
around the discussion—fake history. 
About a year ago, former President 
Obama launched a new, coordinated, 
and very obvious campaign to get lib-
erals repeating the claim that the Sen-
ate rules are somehow a relic of racism 
and bigotry. That came just a month 
after Democrats had used the filibuster 
to kill Senator TIM SCOTT’s police re-
form and anti-lynching bill. 
So these talking points are an effort 
to use the terrible history of racism to 
justify a partisan power grab in the 
present. It is not unlike what we saw 
last summer, when some protest mobs 
ended up defacing statues of people 
who actually crusaded for justice—like 
Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, 
and the abolitionist Matthias Bald-
win—mistakenly damaging good insti-
tutions because of our troubled past. 
Multiple fact checkers have torn into 
this simplistic notion that the rules of 
the Senate are rooted in racism: ‘‘His-
torians told PolitiFact that the fili-
buster did not emerge from debates 
over 
slavery 
or 
segregation.’’ 
One 
scholar’s account was that ‘‘the very 
first Senate filibuster was over a bridge 
across the Potomac River.’’ 
The very first filibuster was over a 
bridge over the Potomac River. 
The junior Senator from Massachu-
setts just got three Pinocchios from 
the Washington Post for these argu-
ments. 
Their look—the Washington Post’s 
look—at history found ‘‘the first re-
corded filibusters in the Senate con-
cerned issues such as where to locate 
Congress, what to do about Andrew 
Jackson’s censure over withdrawn fed-
eral deposits, who would be appointed 
to a publication called the Congres-
sional Globe and whether to create a 
national bank’’—nothing to do with 
racism. 
But I am curious. If my Democratic 
colleagues really believe what they are 
saying, did they themselves use a rac-
ist tool against Senator SCOTT’s police 
reform bill just last year? 
Did they use a racist relic when they 
delayed the CARES Act or blocked leg-
islation to protect unborn babies who 
can feel pain? 
Were Senators SCHUMER and DURBIN 
and their 33 colleagues who signed that 
letter all endorsing a racist relic? 
Or is our colleagues’ story that the 
filibuster was not an offensive relic as 
recently as last summer but magi-
cally—imagine 
this—just 
magically, 
within a year, magically became an of-
fensive relic the instant the Democrats 
came to power? All of a sudden, it is an 
offensive, racist relic when the Demo-
crats came to power. Jaw-dropping hy-
pocrisy. These backflips insult the in-
telligence of the American people. 
The far left is desperate to change 
the subject to the 1960s because they 
want people to forget how Senate 
Democrats behaved just last year. This 
is not about the 1960s. It is not a racist 
relic. 
Look, if some of my Democratic col-
leagues want to keep lobbying two of 
their colleagues to go back on their 
word, they should at least have the 
courage to be honest. 
The far left wants Democrats to 
break the Senate rules for no other 
reason—no other reason—than they 
want more power. They want more 
power. The same people who are trying 
to overturn a certified election result 
over at the House want to break Sen-
ate rules so they can override the elec-
tion laws of all 50 States from right 
here in Washington. It is that simple. 
And it is not going to be hidden by a 
coordinated campaign to change the 
subject.

lowing nomination, which the clerk

sence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, talk con-
tinues to swirl about eliminating the 
legislative filibuster here in the U.S. 
Senate. The Democratic leader has 
threatened that if Republicans don’t 
vote the way he wants them to vote on 
legislation, eliminating the filibuster 
will be on the table. 
In an interview where he issued his 
threat, the Democratic leader made it 
very clear that he is not inviting Re-
publicans to work with Democrats on 
legislation. This isn’t an invitation for 
both parties to sit down at the table 
and arrive at an agreement that both 
parties can support. No. This is an invi-
tation for Republicans to support ex-
actly what Democrats want or face the 
consequences. 
It is ironic that the Democratic lead-
er would be taking that position today 
because this is what he was saying 
back in 2017 about the legislative fili-
buster. This is the Democratic leader 
saying the ‘‘legislative filibuster’’ is 
‘‘the most important distinction be-
tween the Senate and the House. Let’s 
find a way to further protect the 60- 
vote rule for legislation.’’ 
So the Democratic leader was very 
supportive of this back in 2017, when 
they were using it extensively to try 
and stop or slow Republican legisla-
tion. 
The assistant Democratic leader, the 
Democratic whip, Senator DURBIN from 
Illinois, said this in January 2018: 
I can tell you that would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and cre-
ated going back to our Founding Fathers. 
‘‘[G]oing back to our Founding Fa-
thers,’’ referencing the legislative fili-
buster and how important it was his-
torically here in the U.S. Senate. 
Well, about that same time, 2017, 61 
Senators out of 100 here in the U.S. 
Senate—61 out of 100 Senators—signed 
a letter in which they supported reten-
tion of the legislative filibuster. In 
fact, it goes on to say: 
We are writing to urge you— 
And this is to the Senate leaders at 
the time, Senators MCCONNELL
and 
SCHUMER— 
to support our efforts to preserve existing 
rules, practices, and traditions as they per-
tain to the right of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate on legislation before the 
United States Senate. Senators have ex-
pressed a variety of opinions about the ap-
propriateness of limiting debate when we are

considering judicial and executive branch 
nominations. Regardless of our past dis-
agreements on that issue, we are united in 
our determination to preserve the ability of 
Members to engage in extended debate when 
bills are on the Senate floor. 
Sixty-one Senators, including over 30 
Democrats, on record as recently as 
2017 in support of the legislative fili-
buster—over 30 Democratic Senators, 
including the Democratic leader and 
the Democratic whip. 
Well, what has changed? Because now 
they have done an abrupt reversal, a 
complete 180. I mean, they are spinning 
around so fast, it makes your eyes 
glaze 
over. 
What 
an 
incredible 
versatility of conviction they have 
demonstrated on this issue. 
And you think about the reason for 
it. What are they arguing? Well, they 
are saying the Republicans have been 
misusing the filibuster. That is a little 
bit ironic, given the fact that Repub-
licans have been in the majority for 
the past 6 years. Republicans took the 
majority in January of 2015 and held it 
until January of 2021. 
So the past 6 years it has been the 
Democrats who were in the minority. 
They would be the ones exercising the 
legislative filibuster, and they used it 
extensively. They used it extensively 
last year to block legislation, repeat-
edly, over and over and over again. 
And Republicans, at the time, were 
under a lot of pressure to get rid of the 
legislative filibuster, including by the 
President of the United States, over 
and over and over, saying Republicans 
need to get rid of the legislative fili-
buster. 
Republicans, 
being 
consistent 
in 
their position—the 61 Senators, Repub-
licans who signed this letter, including 
me, have been consistent in our posi-
tion, even when we were in the major-
ity, even when the Democrats were 
using the filibuster to block legislation 
that we were trying to advance, that 
we needed to maintain the filibuster 
because it was important to the insti-
tution of the Senate, and it required bi-
partisan cooperation. It required a 
level of comity to get legislation 
passed, and it made sure that the mi-
nority was represented in legislative 
solutions that were produced by the 
U.S. Senate. We have been consistent 
in that position, even when it meant 
taking on our administration, our 
President—over, over, and over again. 
So the Democrats’ argument now is 
that we have to get rid of the legisla-
tive 
filibuster 
because 
Republicans 
have been misusing it. How was that 
even possible? We were in the majority. 
The legislative filibuster is a tool used 
by the minority. It was used by the 
Democrats over and over and over 
again the past 6 years, but their argu-
ment now is that the Senate is not 
functioning, the Senate is not pro-
ducing legislation? Really? 
Last year, Republicans were in the 
majority. We passed out of the Senate 
five coronavirus relief bills with huge 
bipartisan majorities—huge bipartisan 
majorities—responding to the greatest 
crisis facing this country, both health 
crisis and economic crisis. 
We responded to it in a bipartisan 
way, honoring the rules and the tradi-
tions of the Senate, which were created 
by the Founders to make the Senate a 
place unique in all the world, where the 
rights of the minority are honored, 
which required cooperation and work-
ing together to get results. 
And we produced results, in spite of 
the fact that Democrats consistently 
filibustered 
legislation. 
Now, 
there 
were certain pieces of legislation we 
didn’t get passed. We didn’t pass polic-
ing reform. Senator TIM SCOTT offered 
a piece of legislation that included all 
kinds of provisions that would have ad-
dressed that important issue for our 
country, and the Democrats filibus-
tered it, over and over and over again. 
So we didn’t get the 60 votes to get po-
licing reform across the finish line. 
But it is incredibly ironic. I mean, 
hypocrisy is not something that is un-
known in politics, but hypocrisy on 
this level is unprecedented. The Demo-
cratic leader, the Democratic whip, and 
over 30 Democratic Senators have said 
as recently as 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 
that we need to preserve the legislative 
filibuster because it is true to the tra-
dition of the Senate and what the 
Founders intended in terms of the role 
that the Senate was supposed to play 
in our democracy. 
And here we are, 2 or 3 years later, 
not because the Republicans had been 
misusing the filibuster, because the Re-
publicans have been in the majority. 
We have been fending off the use of the 
filibuster by Democrats. They had no 
problems with the filibuster when they 
were using it as a tool at their disposal 
to block Republican initiatives. 
The first CARES bill they filibus-
tered multiple times, and it forced us 
to sit down with them and forge a com-
promise that, in the end, got 96 out of 
100 votes in the U.S. Senate. But now 
the shoe is on the other foot. They are 
in the majority, and they have got all 
these things they want to get done, all 
this pent-up agenda. 
I would argue that what is happening 
here is all the outside groups, all the 
leftwing groups that have all these 
things they want to get done, all of a 
sudden have concluded that notwith-
standing their use of the filibuster to 
block Republicans from accomplishing 
their agenda for the past 6 years, now 
that the shoe is on the other foot, we 
are in the majority and we have got 
power, we are going to do away with 
over 200 years of history—200 years of 
history that was put in place by the 
Founders to require the U.S. Senate to 
be different than the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
The House of Representatives does 
everything by simple majority. They 
have a Rules Committee. I served for 
three terms there. They have a Rules 
Committee that prescribes, basically, 
what legislation can come to the floor, 
what amendments are made in order, 
how much time is allowed for debate on 
each amendment. Everything is very 
structured. It is very organized. It is 
all done by democratic rule—majority 
rule, simple majority rule. 
The Senate was created to operate 
differently by the Founders. And here 
we are having a debate about whether 
we are going to honor that tradition, 
that heritage, that legacy, that vision 
the Founders had when it came to how 
the U.S. Senate should operate. 
Earlier this month, one Democratic 
Senator suggested that we should get 
rid of the filibuster because it is ‘‘un-
democratic.’’ Undemocratic. In other 
words, it prevents the majority from 
doing everything it wants to do. But, 
as I said on the floor last week, letting 
the majority do everything it wants to 
is not what the Founders had in mind. 
The Founders recognized it wasn’t just 
Kings who could be tyrants; they knew 
majorities could be tyrants, too, and 
that a majority, if unchecked, could 
trample the rights of the minority. So 
the Founders combined majority rule 
with both representation and constitu-
tional protection for the minority. 
They established safeguards—checks 
and balances—throughout our govern-
ment to keep the government in check 
and ensure that the rights of the mi-
nority were protected, and one of those 
safeguards was the Senate. 
In the House of Representatives, as I 
said, majority rule is emphasized, and 
the Founders could have left it at that. 
They could have stuck with a single 
legislative body, but they didn’t. Why? 
Because they were worried about the 
possibility of tyrannical majorities in 
the House endangering the rights of 
the minority. 
The author of Federalist No. 62 notes: 
A senate, as a second branch of the legisla-
tive assembly, distinct from, and dividing 
the power with, a first, must be in all cases 
a salutary check on the government. It dou-
bles the security to the people, by requiring 
the concurrence of two distinct bodies in 
schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . . . Sec-
ondly. The necessity of a senate is not less 
indicated by the propensity of all single and 
numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse 
of sudden and violent passions, and to be se-
duced by factious leaders into intemperate 
and pernicious resolutions. 
That is from Federalist No. 62. 
So the Founders created the Senate 
as a check on the House of Representa-
tives. They made the Senate smaller 
and Senators’ terms of office longer, 
with the intention of creating a more 
stable, more thoughtful, and more de-
liberative legislative body to check ill- 
considered or intemperate legislation 
and 
attempts 
to 
curtail 
minority 
rights. 
As time has gone on, the legislative 
filibuster has become perhaps the key 
way the Senate protects minority 
rights. The filibuster ensures that the 
minority party has a voice in the Sen-
ate. It forces compromise. It forces bi-
partisanship. 
Even in the now rare case when a ma-
jority party has a filibuster-proof ma-
jority in the Senate, the filibuster still

forces the majority party to take into 
account the views of its more moderate 
or middle-of-the-road Members, thus 
ensuring that more Americans are rep-
resented in legislation. 
People tend to focus on the fact that 
the filibuster protects the country 
from any one party’s most extreme leg-
islation, but the truth is—the truth 
is—the filibuster is probably the big-
gest reason that any bill in the Senate 
is ever bipartisan. Routine spending 
bills, farm bills, Defense authorization 
bills—the main reason many of these 
bills are ever bipartisan, outside of di-
vided government, is because the fili-
buster forces the parties to com-
promise. Don’t believe me? Just look 
at how the House has handled these 
bills in recent years. 
Democrats were eager to take advan-
tage of the filibuster’s protection for 
minority rights when they were in the 
minority, but now that they are in the 
majority, they don’t want anything 
standing in their way. They don’t want 
to have compromise. They don’t want 
to have to consider the Americans who 
didn’t vote for a Democratic agenda. 
They want to do whatever they want, 
whenever they want it. 
Democrats’ disregard for minority 
rights would be troubling even if they 
had a substantial majority in the Sen-
ate. The voice of the minority deserves 
to be heard even when the minority is 
substantially outnumbered. But it is 
particularly outrageous that Demo-
crats are so determined to sweep away 
protections from minority rights when 
they barely—barely—have a majority 
in the Senate and certainly don’t have 
a mandate. In fact, Democrats don’t 
have a real majority at all; only a tech-
nical one. The Senate is divided 50 to 
50. The only reason Democrats have a 
deciding vote in the Senate is because 
the Vice President is a Democrat. In 
the House, Democrats’ majority nar-
rowed substantially in the November 
election. 
Now, as for the Presidency, while cer-
tainly a Democrat won the election, it 
is worth noting that the only candidate 
who could win the Democratic primary 
was a man historically regarded as a 
moderate. 
Even 
among 
Democrats, 
Democrats’ far-left liberal candidates 
did not fare so well. 
If there was any mandate in the elec-
tion, it was a mandate for moderation. 
It was a mandate for compromise, for 
pulling 
the 
country 
together. 
But 
Democrats are running away from 
unity and bipartisanship as fast as they 
can. They are determined to leverage 
their weak victory into the implemen-
tation of a partisan, far-left agenda. 
There are two bills that have driven 
the conversation around eliminating 
the filibuster in recent weeks. They are 
H.R. 1, an election bill, and H.R. 5, the 
so-called Equality Act. 
The first bill is a truly outrageous 
power grab, an attempt to federalize 
election law and eliminate protections 
for election integrity. Democrats have 
discarded years of important bipartisan 
work on election security and integrity 
in order to permanently boost Demo-
crats’ chances of winning majorities. 
The second, the so-called Equality Act, 
is an unprecedented attack on the 
First Amendment that would substan-
tially restrict the rights of Americans 
to live by their faith. These are the 
bills that Democrats think should be 
shoved through by the narrowest of 
majorities. 
There have been suggestions that 
eliminating the filibuster is the cure 
for partisanship and gridlock in the 
Senate. Well, it might be the cure for 
gridlock in the sense that the majority 
could steamroll through whatever it 
wanted, whenever it wanted, but you 
don’t cure partisanship by making it 
easier for the majority to be partisan. 
Eliminating the filibuster isn’t going 
to eliminate partisanship; it is going to 
heighten it. Take away the filibuster, 
and the majority party has zero rea-
son—zero—to take into account the 
views of the minority. What elimi-
nating the filibuster will do is ensure 
that one party has no voice at all in 
the U.S. Senate, no matter how many 
Americans that party represents. 
A couple of weeks ago, we got a pre-
view of what life would look like in a 
filibuster-less Senate when Democrats 
passed their so-called COVID bill under 
the simple-majority rules of reconcili-
ation. There wasn’t a lot of gridlock 
since reconciliation allowed Senate 
Democrats to force their bill through, 
but there was plenty of partisanship. 
Democrats made it very clear that 
while Republicans were welcome to 
vote for their bill, Republican ideas 
were not welcome at the table. 
Democrats knew that they didn’t 
need Republicans to pass their legisla-
tion, which empowered them to com-
pletely reject Republican input in 
drafting the bill and to load the bill 
with Democratic priorities, from a 
bailout for union pensions, to a State 
slush fund heavily weighted in favor of 
blue States, to the omission of long-
standing Federal restrictions on using 
taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. 
It was quite a contrast to the five bi-
partisan COVID bills passed under the 
filibuster rule in a Republican-led Sen-
ate, which were focused on fighting the 
virus rather than shoving through par-
tisan priorities. 
While their recent narrow majority 
has seemingly erased all memory of 
their minority status over the last few 
years, I encourage my Democratic col-
leagues to remember just how much 
they valued the legislative filibuster 
during their time in the minority and 
how bitterly they regretted elimi-
nating the judicial filibuster once 
President Trump became the bene-
ficiary. 
While Democrats might like to think 
that their time in power will last for-
ever, it is a truth of American politics 
that sooner or later, no matter how 
powerful your majority, you end up in 
the minority again. I encourage my 
colleagues to think about that time 
when they will be in the minority 
again and to ask themselves whether 
they really want to eliminate their 
voices and the voices of their constitu-
ents in future policy battles. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Alabama. 
PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE ACT 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
last week, I spoke about a deeply 
flawed and misguided piece of legisla-
tion passed by the House—House bill 
H.R. 1 and now Senate bill, S. 1. 
Today, I am going to talk about yet 
another bill from our colleagues in the 
House that would be terrible for my 
State of Alabama and for our country. 
It is called the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act, better known as the PRO 
Act. 
Like H.R. 1, the PRO Act represents 
a massive power grab by the Democrats 
here in Washington, DC, to override 
the will of the voters and State legisla-
tures in a majority of the States in 
this country. Democrats want to force 
their ideas on States that refuse to 
adopt their progressive failed policies. 
Federal power grabs like these are un-
constitutional and go against our en-
tire system of government. 
The PRO Act would overrule the 
right-to-work laws across the country 
and force tens of millions of employees 
to join a union. Currently, 27 States 
have 
right-to-work 
laws 
on 
their 
books, including Alabama. More States 
could join us in the future. Right-to- 
work laws give workers freedom, and 
more importantly, they give them the 
freedom to choose whether to unionize 
or not. 
Alabama’s 
right-to-work 
law 
has 
been a huge benefit for our State and 
for the people, helping to attract many 
businesses to our State. Take car man-
ufacturing, 
for 
example. 
Beginning 
with Mercedes, in 1993, automakers 
like Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda all 
have large presences in Alabama. Their 
investment in our State has created a 
growing automotive supplier network, 
supporting roughly 150 companies in 
our State. Altogether, we have around 
40,000 Alabamians employed in the 
automotive sector alone. Those jobs go 
on to support thousands more family 
members, all thanks to Alabama’s 
right-to-work law. 
The PRO Act would upend the eco-
nomic growth we have seen in Alabama 
and in many States across the country. 
By forcing unionization on American 
workers, many industries would grind 
to a halt, and employers’ costs would 
skyrocket, which could lead to a loss of 
many, many jobs. According to the 
State Policy Network, the PRO Act 
would destroy 57 million American 
workers who call themselves free-
lancers, in addition to the millions of 
salaried workers who would lose their 
right-to-work protections. 
Unions, to some degree, have helped 
build our great country, but we need to 
give workers the ability to choose, not 
force them to be in a union. Right-to-

work laws give workers a choice. 
Choice creates competition, and com-
petition breeds success. Forced union-
ization creates a monopoly, which only 
leads to stagnation. 
President Biden says he believes that 
‘‘every worker should have a free and 
fair choice to join a union,’’ but the 
PRO Act would tip the scales towards 
unionized labor even further. Among 
other things, the bill requires that 
workers’ personal contact information 
be sent to unions; removes vote by se-
cret ballot, subjecting them to union 
harassment; and limits the information 
workers may receive during a union-or-
ganizing campaign. That doesn’t sound 
free and fair to me; it sounds like they 
want to ensure a favorable outcome for 
the union bosses and give them the 
ability to punish workers who don’t go 
along with them. 
On a related note, I want to briefly 
mention the upcoming unionization 
vote for nearly 6,000 workers at Ama-
zon’s facility in Bessemer, AL, just 
outside of Birmingham. There has been 
a lot of attention paid to this lately. 
We have had Hollywood actors, celeb-
rities, Members of Congress, and even 
President Biden trying to help tip the 
scales toward the union’s favorable 
outcome. Let me be clear. These hard- 
working Alabamians don’t need Holly-
wood elites or Federal Government of-
ficials telling them what to do. We 
should all trust they will make the de-
cision they think is right for them and 
their families. And that is what right- 
to-work is all about—the right to 
choose. This is still a free country, 
after all. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the crisis that is affecting our country 
right now, and it is the crisis at our 
southern border. Later this week, I will 
travel to Texas to inspect the situation 
firsthand. 
My Republican colleagues and I will 
first say thank you to our law enforce-
ment officers who are there on the 
frontlines. Their work is always impor-
tant, and it is especially important at 
this time. 
The President said on Sunday that he 
hopes to visit the border. He said he 
hopes to visit the border ‘‘at some 
point.’’ Well, with all due respect, the 
American people don’t have time to 
wait. I invite the President to join us 
this Friday. Come with us. See the sit-
uation. Witness it firsthand. 
Here are the facts. In the month of 
February, Federal agents apprehended 
more than 100,000 illegal immigrants 
crossing our southern border. That is 
more than double the number from last 
February. So in just 28 days—28 days of 
February—over 100,000 illegal immi-
grants crossed our border. 
You know, illegal immigration num-
bers usually go down in the winter. It 
rises in the spring and peaks in the 
summer. We have every reason to ex-
pect that this is only going to get 
much worse in the months ahead. Even 
the Biden administration admits it. 
They admit that we are on pace this 
year to have more illegal immigrants 
than any year over the last 2 decades. 
Why is this happening? Well, if you 
ask the migrants, they will tell you the 
answer. His name is Joe Biden. There 
are photographs of migrants near Ti-
juana wearing shirts that say: ‘‘BIDEN 
PLEASE LET US IN!’’ 
They even use the Biden logo—his 
campaign logo—on their shirts. 
So when did the surge of illegal im-
migrants start? Well, just after Presi-
dent Biden took office on January 20. 
Before the month was over, President 
Biden had already issued over seven 
Executive 
actions 
on 
immigration 
alone. 
As I detailed on the floor a couple of 
weeks ago, President Biden has un-
veiled the most leftwing immigration 
agenda in the history of our Nation. 
During the campaign last year, Presi-
dent Biden promised lavish taxpayer 
benefits for illegal immigrants. So did 
Vice President HARRIS. 
When the moderators at the Demo-
cratic debates asked who supported 
free healthcare for illegal immigrants, 
President Biden raised his hand. Vice 
President HARRIS
also endorsed free 
healthcare 
for 
illegal 
immigrants. 
President Biden promised not just am-
nesty but American citizenship for ille-
gal immigrants, and 26 Democrat Sen-
ators have already signed onto the bill 
that he has proposed. 
President Biden said in February 
that he will even give the coronavirus 
vaccine to illegal immigrants. You 
come here illegally; you get a free vac-
cine 
against 
coronavirus 
and 
free 
healthcare. No wonder illegal immi-
grants are rushing to our borders. 
But we all remember what happened 
4 years ago after President Trump was 
elected. Before he even issued most of 
his immigration policies, illegal immi-
gration plummeted. It went down by 40 
percent the first 4 months of his Presi-
dency. It was called ‘‘The Trump Ef-
fect.’’ It happened even before his poli-
cies went into effect. It was because he 
sent a clear message to the world. He 
said: Don’t come here illegally or we 
will send you right back home. That 
message was heard around the world. 
Now we are getting very different 
messages from this Biden White House. 
As a result, we have ‘‘The Biden Ef-
fect,’’ which is the exact opposite of 
what ‘‘The Trump Effect’’ did. We are 
having historic increases in illegal im-
migration. They are promising free 
healthcare, free education, free vac-
cines, offering amnesty, and even citi-
zenship for illegal immigrants. 
Democrats just passed a bill that lets 
illegal immigrants get $1,400 checks. 
Senator COTTON and I tried to stop it. 
Every Democrat in the U.S. Senate 
voted against our amendment. They 
voted to give hard-earned taxpayer dol-
lars to people who aren’t even in the 
country legally. 
The White House says publically that 
we will not expel any illegal immi-
grants under the age of 18. That is what 
they have said publicly. The White 
House Press Secretary even mocked 
that idea. As a result, massive numbers 
of teens and children are crossing the 
border. 
Secretary Mayorkas has told the 
whole world that if you are under 18, 
you get a free pass. He went on tele-
vision last week and said: ‘‘We will not 
expel your child. . . . We will care for 
that child and unite that child with a 
responsible parent. 
In that same interview, he said: ‘‘I 
hope [children] will not undertake that 
perilous journey’’ to our border. 
But as long as liberal policies are in 
place, it is a guarantee. They will un-
dertake the perilous journey. They will 
risk traveling at the hands of smug-
glers, cartels, and human traffickers to 
get here. 
Now we have a system that is over-
whelmed. Our border agents can’t keep 
up. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment just spent $86 million to rent 
hotel rooms—hotel rooms for families 
who illegally crossed the border; $86 
million for hotel rooms for over 1,000 
families. 
It has been reported that more than 
100 illegal immigrants who tested posi-
tive for the coronavirus have been re-
leased into Texas. They were told to 
quarantine after they traveled through 
the country to their preferred destina-
tion in the United States. We don’t 
know where they are now or how many 
people they infected along the way. It 
could be in Texas. It could be any-
where. It is very concerning to people 
all across the country, and yet the 
White House is still in denial. 
In fact, last week, the White House 
Press Secretary had to correct herself. 
She accidentally used the word ‘‘crisis’’ 
when talking about the border. A re-
porter asked her if that meant the 
White House was finally acknowledging 
that it was a crisis. She said no. She 
said it was just a ‘‘challenge.’’ 
Joe Biden promised us he would al-
ways tell us the truth. Yet the Biden 
White House is trying to mislead the 
American people about one of the most 
important issues that is facing our 
country today. It is not working. The 
American public knows this is a crisis. 
Democrats may think that this is some 
political game. In reality, this is a hu-
manitarian crisis. Thousands of chil-
dren are being harmed because of this. 
Liberals talk a lot about how much 
compassion and empathy they feel. The 
truth is, the policies that they have 
don’t lead to compassionate outcomes. 
They lead to some very cruel out-
comes. As Secretary Mayorkas admits, 
the journey north from Central Amer-
ica is a ‘‘perilous’’ one. It is not safe 
for children. Large numbers of children 
who make the journey are trafficked, 
sexually assaulted, or recruited by 
gangs. If this year is like previous 
years, thousands and thousands of chil-
dren are going to be harmed because

they make the journey north. There is 
nothing compassionate about the open 
border policy of this administration. 
It didn’t have to happen. It should 
not have happened, and the blame rests 
squarely with President Biden and the 
open-border Democrats. In less than 2 
months, President Biden has already 
shown himself the most open-borders 
President in our history as a Nation. It 
is no surprise that the whole world has 
noticed. 
This crisis will not fix itself. We need 
to take action. Republicans have a se-
ries of commonsense solutions to im-
prove this situation immediately. They 
include enforcing the law, securing the 
border, and restoring the policy called 
‘‘Remain in Mexico.’’ Without these, 
the Biden border crisis is going to con-
tinue to undermine our Nation’s safety 
and its security.

after me, Senators LEAHY and PETERS 
be allowed to complete our remarks in 
their entirety before the scheduled 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, the de-
bate about the legislative filibuster is 
not a debate about S. 1 or S. 101 or S. 
901. No, this is a debate about nothing 
less than the nature and durability of 
American self-government. Quite apart 
from the wrestling over which par-
ticular bill was filibustered 8 years ago 
or 4 years ago or 2 years ago or tomor-
row, the decision about whether or not 
to eliminate the filibuster is the Sen-
ate’s most important policy debate in 
decades. 
Eliminating the filibuster would ob-
viously have all kinds of policy con-
sequences, from tax rates and labor law 
to energy and infrastructure. But that 
is not why the debate is so important. 
This isn’t fundamentally a debate 
about this or that policy. 
The debate about the filibuster is 
deeper than that because it is a debate 
about how and whether we debate at 
all. This matters a whole lot in a coun-
try this big, in a continental nation, 
because it is right at the heart of how 
peaceable self-government works at 
all. If we just blow that up, if we act as 
if it is just a matter of time before the 
filibuster goes away and all we really 
have is red-versus-blue jerseys anyway, 
if we just end the Senate’s rules as 
they have existed for 240 years, we will 
dramatically alter not just this insti-
tution but our entire form of self-gov-
ernment, and in the process we will 
dramatically escalate the fevered pitch 
of America’s recent arguing. 
We shouldn’t ignore the deep and 
long-term significance of what setting 
the Senate’s rules on fire would mean 
simply because terms like ‘‘super-
majority requirement’’ don’t fit really 
neatly into our modern, made-for- 
cable-TV, soap-opera variety of politics 
as entertainment, politics as sport, 
even 
politics 
as 
religion. 
‘‘Super-
majority requirements’’ are a whole 
bunch of syllables, and it just doesn’t 
make for great sound bites. 
But make no mistake. If we set the 
Senate’s rules on fire, we are going to 
cause dramatic, horrible consequences 
in American civic life. 
Almost every single Member of the 
newly minted Democratic majority in 
the Senate has resolved in recent 
weeks that the legislative filibuster 
needs to be abolished, or, in their most 
recent focus group term, to be ‘‘re-
formed’’ out of existence. 
This move would be directly contrary 
to over two centuries of tradition in 
this country and in this body. It would 
be directly contrary to the Founders’ 
explicit purposes for why this institu-
tion was created at all, and it would be 
directly contrary to the words of doz-
ens and dozens of the majority Sen-
ators—their words just in the last 48 
months. 
This is no mere procedural change. If 
they go through with this, an already 
sick Senate would be committing insti-
tutional suicide. There really is no rea-
son to be a U.S. Senator if the Senate 
doesn’t exist to foster real debate that 
is bigger than simple majority power. 
This nuclear trigger would all but de-
stroy the principle of consensus-build-
ing that the Senate demands and, 
thereby, all but ensure that minority 
rights in this country would become 
subject to more and more fickle, more 
and more power hungry, and, inevi-
tably, more and more abusive simple 
majorities. 
America is built on a number of 
seemingly small, but actually quite 
grand, ideas. One of the very best of 
those ideas, one that is just elegantly 
simple—so simple that we regularly 
don’t pause to reflect on it together 
and to teach it to our kids—is the sim-
ple idea that whenever possible, groups 
of different people should be allowed to 
make different rules for themselves. 
This is what our system of federalism 
is about. This is why we divide power 
both vertically and horizontally be-
tween legislative, executive, and judi-
cial branches, and then also across the 
50 States and versus the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
It is not actually an extravagant 
thought. Children on a playground 
kind of instinctively understand that if 
you can’t get one giant game of kick-
ball together, it is OK to let the play-
ground divide up into a few different 
games of kickball and dodgeball. It is a 
grand American tradition that when 
we don’t have to agree, we don’t have 
to agree about everything. It is OK to 
allow some diversity. It is OK for not 
all workplace regulations to be exactly 
the same everywhere in the country. 
As it happens, America is a really big 
country, a continental nation, and we 
regularly 
don’t 
agree. 
Californians 
don’t always agree with Nebraskans. 
Virginians don’t always agree with 
New 
Yorkers. 
People 
in 
regularly 
sunny Miami don’t always see the 
world exactly the same as folks in reg-
ularly wintry Boston do. Ohio State 
fans don’t have to wear the blue and 
gold of Michigan. 
It is a big country full of disagree-
ments, and so our principle is, regu-
larly, that wherever we can protect and 
respect differences, we should. We don’t 
force folks to wear the jerseys of the 
teams they don’t support. There is no 
reason to. 
I feel like there is some joke I should 
make 
about 
Oral 
Roberts 
versus 
Harbaugh—I know relative competi-
tions against Ohio State—but prudence 
recommends skipping that. 
There are also circumstances, obvi-
ously, where we need to make big wide- 
ranging monopolistic government deci-
sions. There are times when we have to 
have one-size-fits-all rules, but those 
one-size-fits-all obligations are not for 
everything. Even in those moments 
when they are required, we still want 
to work hard to protect the rights of 
minorities and dissenters. 
So how do we respect their rights and 
abilities to make rules for varying 
communities across a nation of 330 mil-
lion people from shore to shore? How 
do we allow as many people as possible 
to make divergent rules as they see fit? 
One of the ways we have done that tra-
ditionally in the Senate is we have al-
ways made sure, here, where we come 
from all across the country—east to 
west, north to south—that we would be 
required to pass legislation not by 50 
plus 1 but by 50 plus 10. 
What that means is that, most all of 
the time, even if you are in the major-
ity, you can’t just do everything you 
want. You can’t just pass one, big, 
compulsory law immediately without 
lots of debate, because you rarely have 
50 plus 10. You have to bring some peo-
ple from across the aisle over to your 
side. If you are in the majority, it 
means that you have to learn the habit 
of sitting down with Members of the 
minority. You have to talk to them. As 
importantly, you have to listen to 
them. 
When this process of compromise 
works and a bill is passed, you are then 
guaranteed that the new law has the 
stamp of approval of at least some rep-
resentatives of the minority on that 
issue, and it means that they will be-
come 
your 
allies 
against 
quickly 
undoing that law next year. They will 
become your allies because the process 
of compromise has led you to listen to 
each other and say: Instead of doing 
the 51-percent thing, what harder work 
might be required to get to the 60-per-
cent thing? 
If the process of compromise breaks 
down, that is a pretty important signal 
as well. When you are forced to make 
rules that are binding on diverse 
groups of people, it is in everyone’s in-
terest that you get as much buy-in as 
possible. That makes it more likely 
that the new rule will be respected and 
followed beyond just this 2-year Con-
gress. Yet, if you shove a rule change

through with a bare-knuckle majority, 
you ensure that 49 percent of the coun-
try is going to resent not just the rule 
but you. Pass laws today with a 50- 
plus-1 majority, and watch them be re-
pealed tomorrow with a 50-plus-1 ma-
jority. Our Nation would just pinball 
from one policy agenda to another. It 
makes politics too central in the lives 
of the American people to allow a fick-
le 51-and-49-percent majority to change 
the whole direction of the Nation. Each 
election would become more do or die, 
more Flight 93ish than the last one. 
Each campaign would descend further 
and further into tribal ugliness. 
In a big and diverse country, the Sen-
ate exists to force lawmakers to build 
a healthy consensus before we try to 
make sweeping national, legal changes. 
The Senate exists precisely to force 
this kind of consensus-building. That is 
really why this institution exists. It is 
how we guarantee that we do not have 
laws on the books that are respected by 
half of the country and resented and 
hated or ignored by the other half of 
the 
country. 
The 
Senate’s 
super-
majority requirement has helped to en-
sure that big changes are not impulsive 
and narrow and instant but, rather, de-
liberate and broadly accepted. 
But there is an alarming trend in our 
time. Let’s be clear: It is in both par-
ties. It is not just the Democrats, who 
are now in the majority, who are inter-
ested in this kind of new, more instant, 
more 
urgent, 
more 
winner-take-all 
kind of politics. There is a new trend 
toward a bare-knuckles belief that this 
is the only kind of politics that works, 
that it is the only kind of way you can 
go forward. 
So my colleagues—again, in both par-
ties—have decided that if you have the 
power, you should wield it, and you 
should wield all of it with no con-
straint. They might use this or that 
particular bill as a stalking horse for 
the attempted power grab, but let’s be 
clear: Any particular bill is beside the 
point; it is about the new ‘‘ends justify 
the means’’ principle, which is the 
principle that there are no principles 
except that of flexing your power as 
vigorously and as brutally and as in-
stantly as you can for as long as you 
can cling to power. 
Some of the Republicans who have 
already spoken on the floor this last 
week have warned the Democrats that 
they might very soon rue the day they 
made this decision. There is an age-old 
self-delusion in power that says: If you 
are in the majority, you will never 
have to be in the minority again, so 
why would you want to respect any 
rules that have traditionally protected 
minorities? You will always be driving 
the bulldozer and never be in its path. 
This debate isn’t about policy. It 
isn’t about any specific bill. You can 
listen to the activists on the outside 
who are advocating for it. They have 
been transparent about their purposes 
for the better part of a year that they 
would use whatever bill they think 
most politically opportune at the mo-
ment to try to end the filibuster. 
Books published on this topic in the 
last 60 days haven’t come about in the 
last 60 days. 
We should remember that if this hap-
pens, if a simple majoritarianism—a 
mere raw exercise of power—becomes 
what this body is about, we will have 
taken a step down a path toward the 
exercise of naked power that will be ab-
solutely permanent. It cannot and will 
not ever be undone. Once the super-
majority rules, once the filibuster is 
gone, it will be gone forever because no 
one—it is self-evident to make this ar-
gument—is ever going to voluntarily 
surrender power when the other party 
has just used a simple-majority power 
against them. No one will ever restore 
supermajority requirements when they 
have a simple majority and a simple 
majority has just become the rule 
against them. 
If you want to see American politics 
become more brutal, if you want to see 
American politics become more crude, 
if you want to see American politics 
become more demagogic, then strip-
ping away the mechanisms that have 
forced us to work together would be 
the perfect recipe for bringing about 
this dystopian reality. If you want to 
see a politics that favors more can-
didates running for office with claims 
that they will be strongmen and ty-
rants, then make politics nothing more 
than a contest of wills between people 
who spend their campaigns promising 
to spend the next 2 or 4 years simply 
making the other side pay. If you want 
to see the rights and interests of mi-
nority groups scorned, dismissed, and 
trampled, then establish a legislative 
process where minority voices don’t 
need to be heard at all. That is what 
would happen if we end the super-
majority requirements that have al-
ways dominated the Senate from its 
first day. If you want lame, meme poli-
tics that aims only to ‘‘own the libs’’ 
or ‘‘drink conservative tears,’’ this is 
how you bring that crap show about. 
You would set the Senate on fire. 
All of you know this, though. Many 
of you have spoken in private about 
this being a rash move. Many of you 
have spoken in public about having 
been opposed to this before. 
I think of my friend BRIAN SCHATZ— 
and I am going to name him precisely 
because he is a real friend, not a Wash-
ington friend, where you claim some-
one is your friend right before you try 
to rip his face off. I actually like the 
guy a lot. I like working with the guy, 
and I would like to keep working with 
the guy. But it turns out, if you make 
the Senate into the House of Rep-
resentatives, there is going to be al-
most no working together across the 
aisle because there will no longer be 
any incentive for it. All the politics 
that matter will happen during the pri-
vate caucus lunches where 51 percent 
will try to keep their 51 percent to do 
whatever they want. 
The Senate is, obviously, not the 
greatest deliberative body in the world, 
but it still has a chance to recover. Set 
it on fire by ending supermajority re-
quirements, and no one should ever 
utter the phrase ‘‘great deliberative 
body’’ again because there will be no 
more deliberation in this body again. 
BRIAN
recently said that the fili-
buster is ‘‘stupid and paralyzing.’’ He 
also said: ‘‘It is time to trash the Jim 
Crow filibuster.’’ Yet, just 4 years ago, 
when Donald Trump was elected and 
the House Republicans were itching to 
have the Senate eliminate the fili-
buster because the Republicans con-
trolled the House, the Senate, and the 
White House, Senator SCHATZ and a 
bunch of his colleagues actually penned 
a public letter that defended the fili-
buster and all of its ‘‘existing rules, 
practices, and traditions’’ precisely be-
cause it advanced the deliberative pur-
poses of the Senate. I don’t remember 
Senator SCHATZ
then calling it the 
‘‘Jim Crow filibuster’’ when he wrote 
that letter or when he was blocking 
TIM SCOTT’s police reform legislation 
last year by pointing to the Senate’s 
supermajority 
requirement 
rules. 
I 
don’t remember Senator SCHATZ call-
ing it ‘‘stupid’’ when he filibustered 
COVID relief in September and again in 
October under the Senate’s current 
rules. 
Look, I want to be clear. I am not 
picking on BRIAN; I am naming him 
precisely because I like him, and after-
ward, we can argue about this. With 
other people I have maybe less of a re-
lationship with, it would be less useful 
to cite them than the people with 
whom I actually have a lot of comity 
and good will. I do want to keep work-
ing with BRIAN, but in a simple 
majoritarian body, there won’t be bi-
partisan cooperation anymore. There 
isn’t much right now, but there is still 
a chance for the reform of this institu-
tion. Ending the filibuster is to end 
this institution. 
To be clear, this isn’t about Senator 
SCHATZ. I could give an hours’-and- 
hours’-long speech and go through all 
the flip-floppers in this Chamber who 
had one position 48 months ago and 
now have a completely different posi-
tion. I don’t need to name all of them. 
We should just ask, what changed? We 
know what changed. The only thing 
that has changed in the last 2 years is 
who is in power. 
When the Democrats were in the mi-
nority, you were fierce defenders of 
this indispensable Senate prerogative. 
That was the language that was used. 
The filibuster was standing between 
America and fascism, we heard. But 
now, when you have the slimmest ma-
jority—actually, it is just 50–50, and 
you need the VP’s motorcade to break 
a tie—the filibuster is standing be-
tween you and some of your legislative 
goals; therefore, it needs to be tossed 
out. When you were using the filibuster 
to halt Senator SCOTT’s police reform 
bill, the filibuster was an essential 
American institution that forced com-
promise. Now that it can be occasion-
ally used to resist a 51–50 straight

majoritarian exercise of power, it is 
supposedly exclusively a relic of slav-
ery and a tool of Jim Crow. It is non-
sense, and the people saying it know 
that it is nonsense. You used the same 
rule last year, and you were not racist 
when you used it last year. 
This is B.S. that has been focus- 
grouped, and particular bills are being 
used as the excuses to grab power that 
won’t just be for this bill; it will be for-
ever. It will be the end of the Senate. 
Was the filibuster really a tool of 
Jim Crow when it was used against TIM 
SCOTT last year? I don’t think so, and I 
don’t think any of you think so. If 
somebody wants to come to the floor 
and repent of their racism for having 
used the filibuster last year, please do, 
but that isn’t what was happening, so 
stop with the nonsense rhetoric that is 
just for an MSNBC sound bite tonight. 
It is sad to watch so many of my col-
leagues who know better be bullied 
into this position of shortsightedness, 
and they do know better, because many 
of you say it in private, and you are 
being bullied by the fringes of your 
party. But part of the responsibility of 
being a U.S. Senator is standing up to 
the extreme fringes of your party. Part 
of the responsibility of being a U.S. 
Senator is to say: I know that people 
are angry. I know that people are 
yelling. I know that there are hot-
heads. But one of the jobs of a Senator 
and surely the job of this body is to try 
to find a way to allow cooler heads to 
prevail. 
We already have an institution that 
is instantly responsive to majorities— 
you only have to walk 200 yards to see 
it—and there is nobody who serves in 
this body who wishes they served in 
that body. We know what it looks like 
to have a simple majoritarian body, 
and the House was designed to do that. 
It is a good thing. The House was de-
signed to reflect the energy of the peo-
ple. When the people are hotheaded and 
they want something done fast and 
they want their majority to act, they 
call on the House and get a hearing, 
but the Senate’s job, the Senate’s pur-
pose, is different. 
The House is actually allowed to act 
with a hothead precisely because the 
Senate exists to cool those passions. 
The Senate exists to act with a cool 
head. Our job is not to cater to sudden 
and instant majorities and to changes 
in the wind; the Senate’s job is to en-
large and refine the House’s judgments 
and to try to build a consensus that 
can last so that the majority’s will can 
be 
advanced 
while 
the 
minority’s 
rights are also protected. 
The bullies who want to permanently 
upend the way our legislature works 
don’t understand that their short-term 
gain of this or that bill will come at a 
long-term cost of the entire structure 
of the rights and interests of our con-
stitutional balance. 
It doesn’t take a lot of courage to go 
with the current of a mob, but a lot of 
Senators who quietly want to resist 
this change—and there are many on 
that side of the aisle who want to re-
sist this change—are worried that 
going against the tide means watching 
dollars and votes flow away. It means 
getting screamed at in restaurants. It 
means that your self-interest is to 
avoid the short-term pain and ride the 
short-term wave. 
Let me tell you, this feels pretty fa-
miliar. When I ran for this seat in 
2014—it was the first time I had ever 
run for anything in my life—one of the 
fundamental reasons I ran, in my hav-
ing never sought any office of any 
kind, was that I thought the Senate 
had a chance to still be restored to its 
deliberative place in American life. 
We are living through a digital revo-
lution that is disrupting the future of 
work, the future of war, the nature of 
local community, the neuron, synapse, 
and frontal lobe formations of our 
teens. The digital revolution is trans-
forming American life everywhere, and 
this institution has a chance to help 
shape some of that for good instead of 
to just allow the tide to flow at full 
speed and consume this institution as 
well. 
So I said, I pledged—and when I said 
it to a largely red State in 2014, most 
people apparently didn’t think I meant 
it—that I wasn’t running just because I 
disagreed with a lot of President 
Obama’s policies but because I would 
defend the constitutional system of 
limited government and a Senate that 
exists for a deliberative process even if 
someone in my own party came to 
power 
and 
urged 
instant, 
radical 
changes that disrespected large por-
tions of America. 
I literally made the centerpiece of 
why I was running that I would resist 
someone in my own party who tried to 
do majoritarian, instant stuff. And I 
can tell you, I can introduce you to a 
whole bunch of Republicans on the 
ground in Nebraska who are really mad 
that, when I said that, I didn’t pre-
cisely say it 17 different ways, where I 
named every person that they might 
later want to have all of that instant 
power. 
After the 2016 election, people started 
looking back at what I said the whole 
2014 campaign and got more uncomfort-
able with what they voted for. So no-
body has to tell me how unpleasant it 
is to stand up and say things that are 
unpopular in your own party. 
Over the course of the last 5 years, I 
have been smeared and censured many 
times. I have been cussed out by lots of 
people who once supported me and 
called me a friend. None of that was 
particularly fun, but so what? 
The oath I took and the duty I swore 
was related to the point of being a U.S. 
Senator, which is that if you are not 
willing to stand up to your own side 
every now and again, there is really no 
point in having this job. And the thing 
is, a lot of you know that. 
I am not going to say it is the con-
sensus position on your side of the 
aisle, but there are a whole bunch of 
people going along publicly with the 
rhetoric of ending the filibuster and 
ending 
supermajority 
requirements, 
even as, at the exact same time, you 
tell me how much you regret the sum-
mer of 2013 decision to allow Harry 
Reid to end a much smaller Senate tra-
dition about supermajority confirma-
tions. 
Supermajoritarian confirmations are 
a small item compared to the change 
that is being considered here. Harry 
Reid’s take-no-prisoners strategy of 
2013 was something that was moved 
unanimously 
by 
the 
then-majority 
party, and many, many, many of you 
have talked to me in private about how 
much you regret it. Please consider the 
costs because this would be a much 
larger change. 
Whenever 
anyone, 
Republican 
or 
Democrat, has threatened to blow up 
the 
Senate 
supermajority 
require-
ments, they always have to tell them-
selves three lies. The first lie is that 
might makes right. The second lie is 
that the other side politically is your 
enemy, and they must simply be beat-
en down; they can never possibly be 
persuaded. And the third lie is that the 
Federal Government is the only gov-
ernment we have. None of these things 
is true. 
I resisted a President, nominally of 
my own party, when he beat me up, 
both in private and in public, for de-
fending the filibuster when my party 
was in the majority. 
Republican Senate leaders stood up 
to him as well, despite lots of ridicule 
from House Republicans. A lot of peo-
ple in the House Republican caucus 
wanted much faster politics, but their 
passions were a poor guide to long- 
term wisdom for a nation this big and 
diverse. It is better for America’s hard-
est debates to be decided in a delibera-
tive 
Senate 
rather 
than 
in 
the 
thunderdome. 
Republicans in the majority held 
firm against blowing up this central 
structural pillar of this institution, 
even when it would have benefited us 
politically. In other words, we faced 
the same choice then that you face 
now, and we decided that it was better 
to choose long-term stability over 
short-term legislative victories. It was 
the right choice for a nation this big 
and this diverse. 
A lot of Republicans think that deci-
sion was naive. Their argument was 
the other side hates us. They will defi-
nitely use all power against us when-
ever they can. And I know that many 
Democratic strategists on the outside, 
many people raising money, small-dol-
lar fundraising online, they are making 
the exact same argument, but this isn’t 
war, and we are not supposed to be per-
manent enemies. 
We want a politics of debate and of 
verbal jousting rather than of physical 
violence. And one of the most urgent 
political tasks we face today is to dem-
onstrate that it is possible for people 
who deeply disagree and who are polar-
ized in our division—we can still work 
together for the common good.

We urgently need to protect and 
strengthen, not weaken and destroy, 
the norms that force us to come to-
gether and cooperate. 
But we don’t need to be naive. We 
don’t need to believe that that means 
we would always sing ‘‘Kumbaya.’’ We 
obviously don’t in this body, but that 
doesn’t mean we are free to be naive in 
the other direction as well. 
For every step we take that further 
divides, further infuriates, and further 
inflames half the country, it makes it 
far likelier that we will set a fire that 
we cannot put out. 
The American Founders understood 
the problem that we are facing. They 
were not naive about how politics 
worked and what it took, what kind of 
labor and sweat and relational hand- 
wringing and bread-breaking it takes 
to be able to work together amicably. 
They were working from a personal ex-
perience of repression, tyranny, and vi-
olence. And so they set out some basic 
principles of federalism, localism, and 
consensus building, of supporting ma-
jorities but without sacrificing minori-
ties. And so they established a frame-
work in which these principles could be 
balanced in a way that is responsive to 
changing conditions and needs. 
The Founders’ concerns are still our 
concerns, but guess what. They built 
the Senate for this exact moment. We 
are constantly tussling over how to 
make sure that every voice is heard 
and every person has a place. We live in 
a divided time. We live in a divided na-
tion. But they lived in a divided time 
and in a divided nation, and so they 
created the Senate to be a place that 
could deescalate red-hot anger, to take 
a deep breath rather than just assum-
ing that a runaway majority of 50 per-
cent plus 1 should advance whatever it 
wanted. 
Friends, colleagues, you know after 
the summer of 2013, the dominoes were 
worse than you had expected, and 
many of you—I don’t know if it is 
most, but many of you have talked 
about how much you regret the sum-
mer of 2013 decision. This decision is 
100 times larger. 
Friends, please consider whether or 
not it is prudent to set the Senate on 
fire. It is the only deliberative struc-
ture we have in our government, and at 
a time when institutions are being con-
sumed, let us not consume another. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
NOMINATION OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of Shalanda Young’s nomina-
tion to be Deputy Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget. 
Ms. Young is a proven leader, a dedi-
cated public servant with the experi-
ence and the expertise needed to tackle 
the challenges facing OMB and our Na-
tion. 
Not only does Ms. Young bring a deep 
knowledge of the budget process and 
government operations, but she has a 
long track record of working success-
fully across the aisle. 
During her 14 years as a senior staff 
member on the House Appropriations 
Committee, she worked tirelessly to 
find a bipartisan path forward on many 
critical issues. 
She played a key role in ending past 
government shutdowns and in negoti-
ating last year’s bipartisan coronavirus 
relief legislation. 
Since President Biden announced Ms. 
Young’s 
nomination, 
Members 
and 
staff, both Democrats and Republicans, 
have enthusiastically praised her abil-
ity to work with both sides and get re-
sults for the American people. This is 
exactly the type of leadership OMB 
needs to successfully steer the country 
through the current public health and 
economic crisis. 
The passage of the American Rescue 
Plan earlier this week was a historic 
achievement. But much of the work to 
fully implement this landmark bill 
still lies ahead, from getting money 
into the pockets of workers and fami-
lies to ensuring schools open swiftly 
and safely and making meaningful in-
vestments in small businesses and local 
governments. 
I have no doubt Ms. Young is pre-
pared to take on the challenging work 
of ensuring relief is delivered swiftly 
and effectively and that families, busi-
nesses, and communities across our 
country have the support they need to 
fully recover from this pandemic. 
I know that in order to move past 
this current crisis, we must work to-
gether. We all want to end the pan-
demic and reinvigorate our economy, 
but there are intense disagreements 
over how we achieve those shared 
goals. 
Ms. Young has demonstrated the 
ability to work hard, to find common 
ground during times of crisis and in the 
face of a deeply divided political cli-
mate, 
experience 
that 
makes 
her 
uniquely qualified to serve at OMB at 
this very moment. 
Having spent most of her career 
working in Congress, Ms. Young will 
also bring a profound respect for the 
role of the legislative branch. She un-
derstands the importance of Congress’s 
oversight role and has firmly pledged 
to work with Congress in a cooperative 
and a transparent manner. 
Ms. Young also fully understands 
that laws enacted by Congress are the 
law of the land, and they remain the 
law of the land regardless of her own 
personal views. 
You know, I know that some of my 
Republican colleagues have expressed 
concerns about Ms. Young’s personal 
views. However, I hope they recognize 
that she has repeatedly committed to 
following the laws put forth by Con-
gress, including laws that she may per-
sonally disagree with. 
There is no doubt that Ms. Young is 
exceptionally qualified for this role. 
OMB urgently needs qualified, Senate- 
confirmed leaders, not only to address 
the current public health and economic 
crisis but also to strengthen Federal 
cybersecurity, review regulations, and 
modernize the Federal workforce. 
In short, OMB works to ensure that 
every part of government is working 
effectively for the American people. 
Her budget expertise, extensive record 
of bipartisan engagement, and deep- 
rooted understanding and respect for 
Congress are exactly what is needed to 
meet the challenges that we face now 
and the challenges that lie ahead. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Shalanda Young as Deputy Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). On this vote, the yeas are 62, 
the nays are 38. 
The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
speak for not more than 5 minutes re-
garding Shalanda Young. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
proud to be here on the Senate floor to 
offer my strong support for Shalanda 
Young to be Deputy Director of the Of-
fice of Management and Budget, as I 
have spoken about her earlier before 
the committee. 
She has worked on the House Appro-
priations Committee for nearly 14 
years. She has been the House Appro-
priations staff director since 2017. 
It is from my position on the Appro-
priations Committee that I got to 
know her very well. I can tell you, 
without any reservation, there is no 
one better suited for this position. Her 
deep understanding of, really, the often 
arcane Federal budget process, her 
years of experience on the Appropria-
tions Committee, her tenacity, and her 
dedication to public service will serve 
the Agency and the American people. 
I think after we had the last close-
down of the government—I believe the 
longest in history—we ended up, fi-
nally, with four of us meeting for sev-
eral weeks in my office here in the 
Capitol. When we forged the agreement 
to reopen, Senator SHELBY and myself, 
Congresswomen Lowey and GRANGER 
from the House—we were chair and 
vice chair of our respective commit-
tees—but, most importantly, Shalanda 
Young was there for the House, as was 
Chuck Kieffer, and she had an oppor-
tunity to work for the Senate. Her 
knowledge of the intricacies of that 
and her ability to help us reach agree-
ment were absolutely essential. 
Ms. Young began her career in public 
service in 2001 at the National Insti-
tutes of Health. She first came to work 
on Capitol Hill as a detailee for the 
House Appropriations Committee in 
2005. She came back as a professional 
staff member in 2007. She worked her 
way up in the committee over the 
years. She helped develop a budget for 
and conducted oversight of key Agen-
cies. That has given her a critical in-
sight into the operation of some of our 
Nation’s most important Agencies, in-
cluding the Department of Homeland 
Security, the Department of the Inte-
rior, the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the General Services Adminis-
tration. She even served as a staff di-
rector for the Legislative Branch Sub-
committee, which covers the budget for 
Congress. 
Ms. Young became staff director of 
the House Appropriations Committee 
in 2017, coincidentally the same year I 
became vice chairman of the Appro-
priations Committee. But she has 
helped the House navigate some of the 
most difficult issues before the Cham-
ber. As I said, she was a critical player 
in helping to end the longest Federal 
shutdown in history in 2019, and she 
was instrumental in crafting 2020 bi-
partisan COVID relief bills. 
She has a reputation as a tough but 
fair negotiator. That is high praise on 
Capitol Hill because she gets it from 
both Republicans and Democrats. I can 
attest to the truth of these statements. 
I have seen these skills firsthand. 
I have already said that the Office of 
Management and Budget is one of the 
most powerful government Agencies 
that most Americans have never heard 
of. That is true. It wields incredible in-
fluence on not just the Federal budget 
but over policies that affect people’s 
lives. 
We need people like Shalanda Young 
to help steer the Agency in these im-
portant decisions. That is why I voted 
yes on the recent motion, and that is 
why I want to see her in that position 
as soon as possible. 
I yield the floor.

Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:35 p.m.,

NOMINATION OF SHALANDA D. 
YOUNG 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
during 
committee 
review 
of 
Ms. 
Young’s nomination to be the Deputy 
Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget, important questions were 
raised about whether she would uphold 
and enforce the restrictions of the 
Hyde amendment if confirmed. I found 
her initial response to a question put 
to her on the subject troubling as it 
suggested she may seek to use her posi-
tion to undermine Hyde. However, 
after speaking with Ms. Young and 
pressing her on the issue, I am satisfied 
that she will follow the law as written 
by Congress without regard to her own 
personal views. She has assured me 
that she has no intention to revise 
rules or regulations concerning Hyde 
and understands it is not her place to 
change law. I therefore have decided to 
vote in favor of her nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of confirming Shalanda 
Young as the Deputy Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget. 
The OMB urgently needs Senate-con-
firmed leaders, and Ms. Young is excep-
tionally qualified for this role. Her 
budget experience and extensive record 
of bipartisan results are what the OMB 
needs to guide our Nation through the 
current pandemic and through the cur-
rent economic crisis. 
During her 14 years as a senior staff 
member for the House Appropriations 
Committee, Ms. Young developed a 
deep understanding of the budget proc-
ess and government operations, and she 
has been instrumental in negotiating 
bipartisan agreements on many critical 
issues. 
She is a proven leader who is ready 
to get to work at the OMB, and I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
her confirmation. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON YOUNG NOMINATION 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

be immediately notified of the Senate’s

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
today I am proud to join a number of 
my colleagues to highlight the impor-
tance of S. 1, the For the People Act. 
The ballot box is the pulsating heart 
of our government of, by, and for the 
people. 
President Lyndon B. Johnson said: 
The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice. 
Think about that—‘‘the most power-
ful instrument ever devised for break-
ing down injustice.’’ 
It is Robert Kennedy who observed 
that ‘‘each citizen’s right to vote is 
fundamental to all the other rights of 
citizenship.’’ 
You know, the opportunity to cast a 
ballot is not just an opportunity. It is 
not simply a responsibility. But it is a 
right—the right—the right that em-
bodies all it means to a republic in 
which the power flows from the people. 
Our Nation, however imperfect in the 
beginning, has worked toward this vi-
sion of citizens through the ballot box, 
driving the vision of our Nation, for 
over 200 years, overcoming barrier 
after barrier. We overcame some of the 
barriers of race with the 14th and 15th 
Amendments. We overcame the bar-
riers of gender with the 19th Amend-
ment. We overcame barriers that had 
denied Native Americans the right to 
vote with the Indian Citizenship Act of 
1924. We overcame the barriers of Jim 
Crow with the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. But now, as we stand in this 
Chamber, the central right of each citi-
zen’s opportunity to participate in the 
election through the ballot box is again 
under attack. 
Right now as we speak, there are 253 
bills in 43 States assaulting the right 
to vote. These efforts are designed to 
make it harder for students to vote, for 
low-income Americans to vote, for Na-
tive Americans to vote, for seniors to 
vote, and most insidiously, for Black 
and Brown Americans to vote. And I 
say ‘‘most insidiously’’ because block-
ing access to the ballot has been a mas-
sive form of systemic racism through-
out our history for Black Americans. 
But all of us in this Chamber have 
taken an oath to the Constitution. All 
of us have a responsibility to defend 
the ballot box. It is our responsibility 
to knock down the barriers that others 
would put up to prevent citizens from 
having the opportunity to participate 
in our elections. That is exactly what 
S. 1, For the People, does in the face of 
the greatest attack on voting rights in 
this Nation since Jim Crow. 
This legislation puts the power back 
where it belongs—in the hands of the 
people. 
This bill said that if you believe in 
the vision of our democratic Republic, 
then you believe in voter empower-
ment, not voter intimidation, not voter 
obstruction, not voter suppression. 
This bill says that the people should 
choose their politicians, not the other 
way around. Gerrymandering attacks 
the very notion of equal representation 
that is so important in the social con-
tract of the citizens with their govern-
ment. So this bill says we will have an 
independent commission in each State 
to draw the boundaries of the districts 
so that we put an end to partisan ger-
rymandering. 
This bill says that government of, by, 
and for the people means you can’t 
have a stadium sound system turned up 
to full volume, drowning out the voice 
of the people. And what is that stadium 
sound system? It is the dark money, 
hundreds of millions of dollars of un-
identified funds racing and coursing 
through our elections across this coun-
try, doing attack ads, with citizens 
having no idea where that funding is 
coming from. That is simply wrong. 
This bill says that public servants 
should work in the public interest, not 
to line their own pockets, not to serve 
simply the wealthy or the powerful or 
the privileged. 
These points are straightforward. We 
have been fighting to improve and 
guarantee the vision of government of, 
by, and for the people over our entire 
history. Now, to protect our system of 
voting, the foundation of our Republic, 
we have to get this bill over the finish 
line. We have an extraordinary team 
working to make that happen, Sen-
ators with sturdy, clear ideals and ex-
cellent ideas and grit and determina-
tion coming together to save our Re-
public: Senator KLOBUCHAR, who will 
be speaking next—author of several of 
the key provisions of this bill, includ-
ing bipartisan provisions—who tomor-
row will be chairing the first-ever Sen-
ate hearing on this landmark legisla-
tion; Senator PADILLA, who knows ex-
actly what it is like to be a secretary 
of state and has been an amazing 
champion for voter empowerment in 
his home State; Senator VAN HOLLEN, 
who led the EMPOWER Act and the 
Restoring Integrity to America’s Elec-
tions Act; Senator WHITEHOUSE, who 
authored the DISCLOSE Act portion of 
the bill and is a tremendous leader on 
campaign finance reform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1693 
March 23, 2021 
Today, our Nation is at a crossroads. 
Are we going to be a nation for ‘‘we the 
people,’’ or are we going to be a nation 
for ‘‘we the powerful’’? 
We must pass the For the People Act 
to save our democracy. As our leader 
said last week, ‘‘Failure is not an op-
tion.’’ So let’s get it done, and let’s en-
sure, as Abraham Lincoln declared, 
that ‘‘government of the people, by the 
people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth.’’ 
I yield to Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today to join my 
colleague, Senator MERKLEY, and so 
many others in speaking in support of 
the critical democracy reforms in the 
For the People Act—legislation that I 
am honored to lead with Senator 
MERKLEY and Majority Leader SCHU-
MER, Representative SARBANES, in the 
House, which passed this bill very re-
cently through their entire Chamber. 
This bill will, in short, make it easier 
to vote, not harder to vote, as, sadly, 
some of our colleagues have proposed 
over the years. But it will make it easi-
er to vote, end the dominance of big 
money in politics and ensure that pub-
lic officials work for the public inter-
est. And it includes provisions, as Sen-
ator MERKLEY noted, from 15 bills that 
I lead to strengthen our democracy. 
I appreciate my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who have contributed 
to the ideas in this bill. It represents 
the combined work of so many people 
in this Chamber who are dedicated to 
improving our democracy. 
Nine bipartisan bills are part of the 
For the People Act—bills like the Hon-
est Ads Act, which I originally intro-
duced with Senator McCain, of the 
great State of Arizona, the Presiding 
Officer’s home State, and now lead 
with Senator GRAHAM
and Senator 
WARNER. 
What does that bill do? Well, it im-
proves disclosure requirements for on-
line ads, disclosure requirements that 
aren’t in law. It is not right. And that 
is why this is just one of the many pro-
visions with bipartisan support, the 
election security reforms that so many 
of us worked on, including Senator 
LANKFORD
and Senator BURR. Those 
are in this bill. 
These are reforms that have broad 
support among the American people. 
According to a Pew Research Center 
poll, 65 percent of respondents said the 
option to vote early, in this bill, or ab-
sentee, in this bill, should be available 
to any voter. And a poll from the Cam-
paign Legal Center found that 83 per-
cent of likely voters support public dis-
closure of contributions to organiza-
tions involved in elections. Of course, 
they do. People want to know who is 
paying for these ads they see on TV. 
They want to know where the money is 
from, and then they can follow the 
money. 
Many of the provisions in the bill 
have already been adopted across the 
country in red, blue, and purple States. 
And Republican and Democratic elec-
tion officials and Governors have sup-
ported them. 
As the chair of the Senate Rules 
Committee, the committee with juris-
diction over Federal elections and cam-
paign finance law and the committee 
to which this bill has been referred, I 
believe we must get this done. Tomor-
row, as noted by Senator MERKLEY, we 
will be holding a hearing on the bill. I 
am pleased that every single Demo-
cratic Member of this committee is a 
cosponsor of the bill. I intend to move 
quickly to a markup to send the bill to 
the Senate floor for a vote. 
The For the People Act is critically 
important. It is important because it 
would improve our democracy by pro-
tecting voting rights, getting dark 
money out of our elections, and put-
ting in place anti-corruption reforms. 
It is important because every one of 
the things that we want to get done, 
from rebuilding our economy to fixing 
our immigration system, to investing 
in infrastructure, to tackling the cli-
mate crisis, to reforming our criminal 
justice system, they all depend on a de-
mocracy that works for the people. 
Last November, in the middle of an 
unprecedented pandemic, nearly 160 
million Americans voted, more people 
than ever before in the history of 
America. Think about that—in the 
middle of a pandemic. And we know we 
saw the pictures on TV. We saw the 
people at the very beginning before we 
knew what safety protocols should be 
in place, when things were getting 
messed around—those people in Wis-
consin in garbage bags, in garbage bags 
in the rain, standing in line to vote. 
Why did so many people vote in the 
middle of a pandemic, both sides of the 
aisle—Democrats, Republicans, Inde-
pendents—why did they vote? Well, 
they were interested in the election; we 
know that. But it was more than that. 
In part, they voted because they had 
more access to voting because of the 
changes that were made in the States. 
Vote-by-mail was available and easier 
for so many more people to do than 
ever before. 
We think about those people who 
suddenly had new means to vote in 
States where they suddenly didn’t have 
to get a notary public or two signa-
tures or this or that just to exercise 
their right to vote. They voted, and 
they voted in droves. 
Even though the overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans have made it clear 
they want to see policies that continue 
to make it easier to vote, sadly, there 
are those on the other side of the aisle 
who have been doubling down to find 
ways to make it harder to vote. As 
Senator MERKLEY noted, over 250 bills 
were introduced in States across the 
country, including my home State of 
Minnesota, that had the highest voter 
turnout once again in the country. 
People are trying to make it harder to 
vote, including in Arizona where they 
had such a record turnout, including in 
Georgia. Why? As Senator WARNOCK 
said so beautifully and succinctly in 
his maiden Senate floor speech just 
last week: ‘‘Some people don’t want 
some people to vote.’’ Well, that is not 
how this country was founded. That is 
not what our Constitution says. 
We cannot just sit back and let our 
democracy be undermined. As I said 
from the inaugural stage on that beau-
tiful blue-sky day at the very place 
where you could still see the spray 
paint at the bottom of the columns and 
makeshift windows that we had in 
place after the January 6 attack: 
This is the day our democracy picks itself 
up, brushes off the dust, and does what 
America always does: goes forward as a na-
tion, under God, indivisible with liberty and 
justice for all. 
For decades, there have been those 
who have been trying to chip away at 
the fundamental right to vote. We 
can’t just keep taking it. We have to 
ensure that right to vote. 
What is this about? One, making it 
easier to vote. That is exactly what 
For the People does. It includes provi-
sions that I have championed and so 
many others have, like automatic vot-
ing registration, ending purges of vot-
ing rolls, ending redistricting commis-
sions, requiring all States to allow 
same-day voting registration, and vot-
ing by mail. 
These are commonsense policies that 
were already in place in many States 
in the 2020 general election. Forty-five 
States didn’t require an excuse to vote 
by mail. This will ensure that in every 
State, you don’t need to make an ex-
cuse. Twenty-one States have same- 
day registration, including States like 
Idaho, Wyoming, and Iowa. Forty-three 
States have early voting. Just last 
month, Kentucky’s Republican sec-
retary of state praised a State bill that 
would make early in-person voting per-
manent. 
Certainly, we need to ban purges of 
voting rolls. As my friend Stacey 
Abrams said: If you don’t go to a meet-
ing every year, you don’t lose your 
right to assemble under the Constitu-
tion. If you don’t go to church or syna-
gogue or mosque or temple, you don’t 
lose your right to worship. So if you 
haven’t voted for a few elections and 
you decide you want to vote because 
you care about a candidate or an issue, 
you should not lose your right to vote. 
But in too many places, that is not the 
case. 
Twenty States already have auto-
matic voter registration laws, includ-
ing West Virginia, Alaska, and Geor-
gia. This bill simply says they all 
should. 
The second major reform we need is 
to get the big money out of politics. 
The For the People Act helps bring 
transparency to campaign spending so 
that voters are informed about who is 
funding candidates and who is paying 
for the ads. 
It also tightens regulations on super 
PACs and restructures the Federal 
Election Commission to make it more

effective and less prone to partisan 
gridlock. 
The third major reform in the For 
the People Act is restoring trust in our 
government. 
Democracy 
isn’t 
just 
about what happens on election day; it 
is also about making sure that our 
elected officials are accountable once 
they take office. 
The For the People Act ensures that 
Members of Congress and other Federal 
officials are truly working for the peo-
ple. It expands conflict of interest laws, 
prohibits Members of Congress from 
serving on the boards of for-profit enti-
ties, and codifies ethics rules for the 
executive branch. 
Most importantly, why does the 
highest Court in the land not have any 
ethic rules for the Supreme Court when 
every other Federal court in the Na-
tion does? This bill answers that ques-
tion. 
Three simple ideas: Making voting 
easier, getting big money out of poli-
tics, and strengthening ethics rules. 
The year 2020 marked the 100th anni-
versary of the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment, which granted women the 
right to vote, and a century after that 
ratification, we elected our first Afri-
can American, first Asian American, 
and first woman Vice President in Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS. As we cele-
brate these firsts, we are reminded that 
throughout our country’s history, the 
right to vote has been hard-fought and 
hard-won. 
As Congressman John Lewis, whom 
we sadly lost, once said: 
Your vote is precious, almost sacred. It is 
the most powerful nonviolent tool we have 
to create a more perfect union. 
When we reflect on the sacrifices and 
strides that have been made for the 
right to vote, one thing is very clear: 
The fight isn’t over. The best way we 
can honor the countless Americans 
who have risked and, in some cases, 
given their lives—given their lives to 
protect our freedoms overseas, given 
their lives to protect our democracy 
here at home—the best way is to make 
sure that democracy continues unfet-
tered and that everyone has the right 
to vote because we know, as Senator 
WARNOCK reminded us, that there are 
some people who are trying to make it 
hard for some people to vote. That is 
not how America works. 
The For the People Act is all about 
making sure America works for every-
one. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I see we are joined by two Senators 
who are going to be speaking, Senator 
PADILLA—three Senators—from Cali-
fornia, as well as Senator WHITEHOUSE 
from Rhode Island and Senator VAN 
HOLLEN from Maryland. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise to speak today on the For the Peo-
ple Act. 
But before I do, I want to take a mo-
ment to honor the lives of those trag-
ically lost in Colorado yesterday by yet 
another senseless mass shooting in our 
country. My heart breaks for their 
families, but the sobering and harsh re-
ality is that in many parts of the 
United States, it is easier to buy a gun 
than it is to cast a ballot. In 25 States, 
voters must be registered and have spe-
cific forms of identification in order to 
cast a ballot, but those same States 
allow people to buy rifles without per-
mits and require no bond checks for 
some sales. Think about that. It seems 
to me that we have our priorities en-
tirely backward when it comes to mak-
ing it easier to buy a weapon than we 
do to cast a ballot. 
As we work to rebuild our economy 
for all people, we must acknowledge 
that to build an inclusive economy, we 
need an inclusive democracy. Just as 
the pandemic has put a spotlight on 
the inequities in our economy and our 
healthcare systems, so, too, has the 
pandemic put a spotlight on the inequi-
ties in access to the ballot. The 2020 
election, held in the midst of the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
demonstrated 
once again that we have made it easier 
for some citizens to vote than others. 
This is not an accident. 
Depending on where a voter lives, 
they may or may not have the ability 
to register to vote online; they may or 
may not be able to participate in same- 
day registration; they may or may not 
be able to vote early or vote by mail. 
All this varies State by State. This 
patchwork has a direct and dramatic 
effect on whose voices are heard in our 
democracy, and, too often, it is work-
ing-class communities, communities of 
color, young people whose voices are si-
lenced. 
For voters whose work schedule does 
not allow them to wait in line to vote, 
the denial of vote-by-mail or early vot-
ing denies the opportunity to vote alto-
gether. 
For voters who do not have that spec-
ified form of State identification, even 
though they are American citizens of 
voting age and otherwise eligible to 
vote, lack of an ID can mean that they 
will not be given a ballot, even if they 
can verify their identity some other 
way. 
For voters who want to vote by mail 
and may have access to some form of 
vote-by-mail, unreasonable ballot re-
ceipt deadlines, a scarcity of ballot re-
turn locations, and/or slow or unreli-
able Postal Service delivery can mean 
that their ballots won’t be counted. 
For young voters and for those who 
move frequently, antiquated registra-
tion systems and unreasonably early 
registration deadlines can leave them 
unable to register to vote or to update 
their registration record in time to ex-
ercise their fundamental right to vote. 
All of these voting restrictions have 
a disproportionate impact on commu-
nities of color. Just like the poll taxes 
and literacy tests of the Jim Crow era, 
the truth is plain for all to see: Voter 
suppression laws are rooted in White 
supremacy. 
The For the People Act presents an 
opportunity for us to establish a base-
line of voting rights and ballot access 
for all voters. I know that the For the 
People Act will improve voting rights 
in America because, as California’s sec-
retary of state, I helped adopt and im-
plement these best practices. These in-
clude automatic and same-day voter 
registration; online voter registration; 
expanded access to vote-by-mail; ex-
tended early voting periods—in-person 
early voting periods; and widespread, 
convenient access to secure, official 
ballot drop-off locations. Together, 
these policies help to ensure equitable 
access to the ballot and, in so doing, 
strengthen our democracy. 
While California has led the way in 
making our elections more accessible 
to all voters, the policies we have im-
plemented are not unique to our State. 
States like Maine and Alaska have also 
adopted automatic voter registration 
policies. States like Utah, Iowa, Idaho, 
and Wyoming also permit same-day 
voter registration. States like Florida 
and Ohio allow no-excuse vote-by-mail 
and provide voters with early voting 
options as well. 
The election reforms within the For 
the People Act are not partisan. These 
reforms are not Democrat or Repub-
lican. They are common sense and are 
proven to work. All voters deserve 
equal voting rights and equal access to 
the ballot. 
Colleagues, we are a stronger democ-
racy and a better nation when we hear 
all voices from all corners of our Na-
tion and when those voices are not just 
heard but counted. By passing the For 
the People Act, we can ensure that 
more voices are heard and more voices 
are, indeed, counted. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
first, I thank my colleagues who have 
gathered here on the floor to help pass 
and urge the passage of this very im-
portant piece of legislation, the For 
the People Act. 
Our Constitution begins with three 
words that ring in the minds of each 
and every American, ‘‘We the People.’’ 
Seventy-six years after those words 
were written, President Lincoln re-
solved, in 1863, that those who had lost 
their lives on the battlefield at Gettys-
burg ‘‘shall not have died in vain and 
that the government of the people, by 
the people, and for the people shall not 
perish from the Earth.’’ 
One hundred two years after Gettys-
burg, our beloved former colleague, 
Congressman John Lewis—then a civil 
rights activist and leader—together 
with nonviolent marchers, was beaten 
bloody by Alabama State Troopers in 
1965 as they crossed the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge while demanding voting rights. 
Later that year in 1965, Congress acted 
and did pass the Voting Rights Act, 
and 
it 
was 
reauthorized 
regularly 
thereafter, most recently in 2006 by a 
vote of 90 to 0 here in the U.S. Senate

and 390 to 33 in the House, where I 
served at that time. 
Then, in 2013, in the case of Shelby 
County v. Holder, the Supreme Court, 
in a notorious 5-to-4 decision, stripped 
away a key enforcement provision from 
the Voting Rights Act: the require-
ment that the Department of Justice 
approve changes to voting rights laws 
in States that had histories of dis-
criminating against African-American 
voters and others in their past laws. 
Almost immediately, like within 24 
hours, you saw States that had been 
covered by that act begin to move to 
erect barriers to the ballot box, mak-
ing it more difficult for people of color 
to vote. Indeed, in the case of the 
North Carolina State Conference of the 
NAACP v. McCrory, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said 
that the voting provisions passed by 
the North Carolina legislature, in the 
aftermath of the rollback of the Voting 
Rights Act, were designed to ‘‘target 
African-Americans with almost sur-
gical precision.’’ 
Now we come to 2021. On January 6, 
we witnessed a violent mob, incited by 
the former President of the United 
States, attack this Capitol in order to 
overturn the results of a democratic 
election. The mob came because of the 
big lie—the big lie told by Donald 
Trump and fueled by some of his allies 
here on Capitol Hill—that he had been 
cheated out of an election victory. It is 
a pernicious and insidious lie that has 
caused Republican State legislatures 
across the country to try to build up 
barriers to voting: limiting vote-by- 
mail, reducing the number of days for 
early voting, even making it illegal in 
Georgia for anyone to provide water to 
someone who is waiting in line to 
vote—a real provision that has already 
passed the Georgia House and that is 
on its way to the Senate. These are all 
measures designed to make it harder 
for American citizens to exercise their 
right to vote. 
We needed the For the People Act be-
fore January 6, but we need it more 
than ever now to establish some min-
imum national standards to ensure 
that every American’s right to vote is 
secure. 
In addition to the barriers being 
erected around the country to voting, 
our democracy faces another real and 
present danger: the flood of cash from 
Big Money and special interests—in-
vading the airwaves and invading the 
internet—that seeks to drown out the 
voices of everyday Americans. 
In 2010, in another notorious 5-to-4 
Supreme 
Court 
decision, 
Citizens 
United, the Court opened the flood-
gates to unlimited amounts of cor-
porate special interest money flowing 
into our elections. Over $14 billion was 
spent in the 2020 election cycle, much 
of it secret. In fact, one of the con-
sequences of that decision, coupled 
with already existing laws, was that 
more money flowed secretly into our 
elections—the dark money, the dark 
money trying to hijack our democracy 
for the highest bidder. 
As my colleagues have said, the 
American people have a right to know 
who is spending all of this money to 
try to influence their votes. That is 
why, back in 2010, I authored and the 
House passed the DISCLOSE Act—to 
require that the information be avail-
able to voters and the American peo-
ple. In fact, had that House bill become 
law, we wouldn’t have secret money 
today. While it was overwhelmingly 
popular in the country and supported 
by an overwhelming majority of Sen-
ators at the time, because of fate and a 
quirk of history in the death of Ted 
Kennedy, the Senate was not able to 
secure the 60 votes necessary to over-
come a filibuster. Ted Kennedy passed 
away, and his replacement was a Re-
publican. This Senate voted with 59 
votes—a big majority—to pass the DIS-
CLOSE Act, but because of the fili-
buster rule, it couldn’t get over that 
hurdle. 
The DISCLOSE Act is part of S. 1. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE
and all of the 
Senators here have been part of that 
effort. It is part of S. 1. 
We cannot afford to repeat the his-
tory of 2010. We cannot allow a minor-
ity of Senators who represent a minor-
ity of the public in this country and 
the people of this country to stop the 
For the People Act. We have a duty to 
every patriotic American who has 
worked hard—and the many who have 
spilled blood—for the right to vote. We 
have a duty to pass the For the People 
Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
pick up where Senator VAN HOLLEN left 
off because, when he was fighting for 
the DISCLOSE Act in the House, I was 
the manager of that bill on the floor 
here in the Senate. 
It would do something very simple. If 
you are spending more than $10,000 in 
an election, we ought to know who you 
are. That is pretty easy. It is not going 
to rope in lots of small donors. It will 
get the big interests who are out there 
trying to control our democracy and 
hide who they are while they are doing 
it. 
As Senator VAN HOLLEN said, this 
started with Citizens United—a wretch-
ed decision that unleashed unlimited 
money into our politics, but it said 
that the unlimited money was going to 
be transparent. That was its predicate: 
It is going to be transparent. You won’t 
have corruption because everybody will 
be able to see. The ad will say: We are 
ExxonMobil, and we paid for this mes-
sage. 
Well, of course, the dark money 
forces, in having achieved that victory 
at the Supreme Court, went right out 
and violated that predicate—right out. 
They have built an entire architecture 
of deception around their campaign fi-
nances since then. It is the 501(c) cor-
porations that don’t have to report 
their donors. It is the donor-advised 
trusts that are money identity laun-
dering devices for big donors. It is even 
as simple as phoney-baloney shell cor-
porations. Sometimes they are stacked 
up, and the money goes to the phoney- 
baloney shell corporation. The shell 
corporation 
launders 
it 
through 
DonorsTrust, and DonorsTrust gives it 
to the 501(c), and it dumps it into the 
super PAC. They all know it is going 
on. This is orchestrated stuff. 
So we have a real battle on our 
hands. We passed the billion-dollar-in- 
dark-money threshold a long time ago. 
When people are spending $1 billion in 
dark money to influence what goes on 
in this country, you can bet they are 
winning. You can bet they are winning. 
They wouldn’t keep spending money by 
the billions if they were not winning. 
So we have to put a stop to this. 
The American people are with us. 
The polling is unbelievable. It is in the 
nineties. Whether you are a Bernie Bro 
or a tea partier, you hate the idea that 
there is big dark money in politics 
calling the tune for Congress to dance 
to, but that is the fact. Look at the 
outcomes. 
Look at climate change. There is no 
dispute about the science. We all know 
what needs to be done, but one big spe-
cial interest, the fossil fuel industry, 
has shut down one political party. My 
strong bet is, if you looked at all of the 
dark money funding the Republican 
Party in Congress, you would find that 
it is 80 percent the fossil fuel industry. 
They have become the political wing of 
the fossil fuel industry, and they spe-
cialize in fake climate denial for that 
reason, and it is going to cost us. The 
lost decade on climate is going to cost 
us. 
So dark money is not just a plague to 
the integrity of American democracy; 
it is a plague that harms our ability to 
deal with the other problems that are 
coming our way—wherever there is a 
big special interest that can play the 
game of hiding the money and moving 
it around. 
Let me say one last thing. 
Dark money? Not really. It is not 
dark to the candidate who is the bene-
ficiary. When a big dark money donor 
sets up a shell corporation and gives it 
a couple of million dollars and then has 
that shell corporation launder the 
money through DonorsTrust and then 
has that money go into a super PAC to 
be spent for a particular candidate or 
against his opponent, do you think 
they don’t find a way to let the can-
didate know what they did and why? 
The only people who are not in on the 
joke are the American people, and we 
have got to put an end to this. 
Democracy behind masks isn’t de-
mocracy at all. Let’s get rid of this 
stuff. The American public will be with 
us. It will provide health and hygiene 
to our democracy again, and we will 
start to see results for the American 
people in a way that the dark money 
has prevented. 
I thank Senator MERKLEY for leading 
us in this enterprise. This is a public 
service. This is why we came here. This

is the democracy that needs defending, 
and, by God, we are going to defend it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
happy to join in this block of time in 
which Members are coming forward to 
talk about the For the People Act. 
I thank Senator MERKLEY for being 
our leader and inspiration in many as-
pects of this and Chair AMY KLOBUCHAR 
from the Rules Committee, who will 
have the honor of bringing this matter 
before our committee for debate and 
discussion. 
Tomorrow is going to mark 11 weeks 
since we sat in this Chamber late into 
the night and debated the certification 
of the electoral college vote of the No-
vember 3 election. It was an experience 
none of us will ever forget. 
Hours before we were told to rush out 
of this Chamber as quickly as possible 
because the insurrectionist mob was 
just a few feet away, we had been told 
they were going to keep this place safe 
for us. We were to sit at our chairs and 
gather our staffs along the walls. You 
will be safe. You will be just fine. Ten 
minutes later, they said: Run as fast as 
you can. It was an experience that 
none of us ever expected in the U.S. 
Capitol Building and one we will cer-
tainly never forget. 
We had been rushed out of the Cham-
ber as this mob attacked the Capitol in 
an effort to stop us from fulfilling our 
constitutional duty in recognizing Joe 
Biden as the President of the United 
States. If that were in a novel 20 years 
ago, I would have said: It is prepos-
terous. It will never happen in Amer-
ica. 
But I saw it. I lived it. Many of us 
did. 
This mob had been fueled by weeks of 
lies, disinformation, and baseless alle-
gations of fraudulent votes and a sto-
len election. 
I couldn’t get over that, yesterday, a 
lawyer named Sidney Powell, who was 
the big defender of the big lie, said: Do 
you mean people actually believed me? 
How could they possibly believe me? 
Well, that is how far it has come. The 
preposterous statements being made by 
the pro-Trump forces about stealing 
the election now are so laughable that 
people are trying to escape legal liabil-
ity by saying: Surely, you didn’t take 
that seriously. 
Well, an awful lot of people did across 
America, and many of them marched 
on this Capitol. 
Despite this horrific attack on the 
Capitol and our democracy, some of 
our colleagues, to amplify these wild 
claims, they continue to object to the 
electoral vote count and claim that 
Congress needed to do more to assure 
voters that the 2020 election was legiti-
mate. 
A few of those colleagues even pro-
posed a sham Commission to audit the 
election. They were relying on an 1876 
precedent that was responsible for the 
end of Reconstruction and the begin-
ning of the Jim Crow era, a precedent 
that established rank discrimination 
against African Americans for decades 
and invited brutal voter suppression ef-
forts that sadly, amazingly, we are still 
fighting today. 
Here is the reality: If those col-
leagues were serious about protecting 
democracy, they would be standing on 
the floor with us right now. They 
would have stayed in their seats when 
the electoral college vote was certified. 
They wouldn’t have spent weeks chal-
lenging and questioning the legitimate 
results of an election that their chosen 
candidate actually lost, and they would 
be on the floor with us, as I said, in 
support of the For the People Act. 
Anyone who truly believes that we 
need to strengthen the integrity of our 
elections 
and 
democratic 
process 
should be cosponsoring this bill. 
The For the People Act ensures that 
all eligible Americans can cast a ballot 
without burdensome barriers that sup-
press the vote. 
In 1890, there was established some-
thing called the Mississippi Plan. The 
Mississippi Plan was State legislation 
carefully crafted to make certain that 
African Americans didn’t have the 
right to vote. 
Other States looked at it carefully 
and said: This is the answer. Literacy 
tests, poll taxes, every obstacle they 
could dream of became part of the Mis-
sissippi Plan, with the express purpose 
of disenfranchising African Americans 
recently emancipated. 
That plan, unfortunately, lived out 
its days for decades and performed as 
expected, suppressing the vote. Again, 
we face this kind of challenge. 
The bill that we are talking about 
here invests in election infrastructure 
and provides State and local officials 
with the resources they need for safe 
and secure elections. 
The bill reforms a broken campaign 
finance system that elevates the voices 
of wealthy donors today and special in-
terests, and it strengthens and en-
hances ethics and transparency re-
quirements. 
I am proud to be here today because 
this bill also includes the Fair Elec-
tions Now Act. I have introduced this 
every year since 2007. And occasionally, 
just occasionally, I would get a Repub-
lican cosponsor. 
The idea behind it is simple: public 
financing of campaigns, a voluntary, 
small-donor public financing system 
for Senate candidates who agree to 
raise small-dollar contributions, not 
big money. 
The fair elections public financing 
system would elevate the views and in-
terests of a diverse spectrum of Ameri-
cans rather than just the wealthy. 
I am lucky to have a House sponsor, 
JOHN SARBANES. His father and I served 
in the Senate together, and he really 
has done a remarkable job promoting 
the bill in the House. 
We would pay for these campaigns, 
public financing, without spending a 
dime of taxpayers’ dollars. It would be 
financed with assessments on wealthy 
bad actors and industry lawbreakers. 
Voluntary, 
small-donor 
public 
fi-
nancing of congressional campaigns 
would mean more candidates with 
more ideas and a Congress that works 
for more than just the top 1 percent in 
America. 
I thank Senator MERKLEY for, once 
again, including this act in the bill, 
and, again, I thank Congressman SAR-
BANES for his leadership in the House. 
The Fair Elections Now Act is just 
one of the many critical reforms in this 
bill that will empower voters and com-
bat corruption. 
After months of the former President 
and his allies undermining faith in our 
electoral system with their unjustified 
claims, we must take immediate, con-
crete steps to repair our battered de-
mocracy. 
I urge all my colleagues to join in 
this mission and support the For the 
People Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleagues who have come to 
the floor to speak so powerfully to the 
essential task of defending the ballot 
box, of stripping dark money out of our 
elections, of honoring the vision of 
equal representation by ending the 
practice of gerrymandering across this 
country. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, who chairs the 
Rules Committee and who will host 
and direct the committee hearing, the 
first ever for S. 1, For the People Act, 
made a powerful representation of how 
vote-by-mail gives every citizen a full 
opportunity to participate in elections 
without the manipulations that can 
occur on election day, when different 
people who do not want you to have ac-
cess to a ballot can put all kinds of 
hurdles and obstacles in your way. 
Senator VAN HOLLEN, who authored 
the DISCLOSE Act in the House, re-
minded us of John Lewis and his fellow 
protestors being beaten bloody on the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge to secure the 
right to vote, as so many other Ameri-
cans have fought for the right to vote 
since our founding. 
Senator PADILLA, who implemented 
so many reforms in California as Sec-
retary of State, gave us a sense that 
this can be done anywhere in the coun-
try in time for next year’s elections. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE, who has cham-
pioned the DISCLOSE Act in the Sen-
ate, noted that there is a scheme of 
501(c)(3) corporations and donor advice 
trusts and phony-baloney shell cor-
porations, as he put it, all working to 
corrupt our campaigns and that the 
amount of money that has been used to 
secure power to the powerful by manip-
ulating the elections now exceeds $1 
billion. 
And Senator DURBIN, who has cham-
pioned year after year after year the 
Fair Elections Now Act, presenting a 
powerful remedy for the role of Big 
Money donations in our campaigns 
through public financing—public fi-
nancing, not with government funds

but with funds that come from cor-
porate malfeasance. 
So I appreciate so much these col-
leagues who have been all involved in 
so many different ways in this battle 
to save our Republic. 
There is always a powerful force 
seeking to manipulate the election 
process to their favor, and it is one of 
many tools that that powerful group 
brings to bear. There are the dozens of 
lawyers who work night and day, being 
paid hundreds of dollars an hour, to se-
cure power for the powerful. There are 
the public media campaigns that take 
tens of millions of dollars to frame 
issues to try to persuade Americans of 
their particular viewpoint or to drive a 
wedge between different groups of 
Americans. There is that dark money. 
There are those efforts in State legisla-
tures to block the vote. 
I want to just close by reminding us 
all that the Constitution clearly states 
that elections for Senators and House 
Members, this body—Congress—has the 
ability to pass laws to make sure those 
elections are fair across this country 
because every American of any State 
has a clear stake in the legitimacy of 
the elections in other States because it 
is the collective voice here that makes 
decisions. So this is not only a respon-
sibility provided to us, it is a responsi-
bility that we must fulfill to defend the 
ballot box, to end gerrymandering vio-
lating equal representation, and clear 
that dark money, polluting and cor-
rupting our campaigns, out of the sys-
tem forevermore. 
Let’s get this essential bill, this es-
sential defense of the pulsating heart 
of our democracy, the ballot box—let’s 
get this bill passed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am an 
unabashed optimist. I am a glass-half- 
full not a glass-half-empty kind of guy, 
and I tell my staff that I am like the 
little boy who goes down on Christmas 
morning and looks under the Christ-
mas tree and finds a pile of manure and 
wonders where my pony is. That is how 
much of an optimist I am. 
So 
I 
am 
optimistic 
about 
our 
progress made in the war against 
COVID–19 after this long year that we 
have all endured. So far, a quarter of 
Americans over the age of 18 have re-
ceived at least one dose of the vaccine. 
More than two-thirds of people over 65 
have gotten their first shot. In my 
State, they have recently said every-
body 50 and up can get a shot. Now, 
very soon, any adult person over the 
age of 16 will be eligible to get the vac-
cine. That translates into good news 
across the board. New cases, deaths, 
and hospitalizations are all declining. 
Over the last week, the 7-day positivity 
rate in Texas dropped to the lowest 
point since last May. 
While we continue to follow the pub-
lic health guidelines to slow the spread 
of the virus, it is clear we are moving 
closer and closer to an eventual end of 
this pandemic, and there are a million 
reasons to be optimistic. 
Despite the narrative pushed by 
some, all of this hope isn’t the result of 
just the last couple of months, and it 
certainly is not the product of the par-
tisan bill that was passed just 2 weeks 
ago. These efforts have been underway 
for more than a year now, and we owe 
a great deal of credit to Operation 
Warp Speed, the initiative set up by 
the Trump administration to accel-
erate the development of vaccines, 
treatments, and therapeutics. 
Last summer, when President Trump 
speculated that we would have an effec-
tive vaccine by the end of the year, he 
received some serious blowback. One 
media outlet published a fact check 
saying it would require nothing short 
of a ‘‘medical miracle.’’ Well, thanks to 
the leadership of the previous adminis-
tration, thanks to the great scientists, 
pharmaceutical companies, and others, 
that so-called miracle has come true 
not just once but twice. Both the Pfizer 
and Moderna vaccines received emer-
gency authorization last year, and 
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was au-
thorized last month. 
Rather than setting ambitious goals 
to bring an end to the pandemic, the 
Biden administration has embraced a 
different 
approach. 
An 
Associated 
Press headline in January evaluated 
the situation pretty well when it said 
that Biden’s early approach is to 
‘‘underpromise’’ and ‘‘overdeliver.’’ 
Well, in December, President-Elect 
Biden announced his administration’s 
vaccine goal as 100 million shots in the 
first hundred days. That announcement 
came about a week before the first 
doses of the vaccine were distributed, 
before we had a real-world test of the 
processes that had been in the planning 
stages for months. But it quickly be-
came obvious that we were on a pace to 
meet that goal before President Biden 
even took the oath of office on January 
20. The week of the inauguration, we 
averaged 1 million shots a day. On Jan-
uary 20, 1.5 million Americans received 
the vaccine. One physician and public 
health expert described the President’s 
goal as a ‘‘disappointingly low bar.’’ To 
no one’s surprise, the administration 
met that goal well ahead of the dead-
line. 
Last week, the President claimed a 
victory for hitting 100 million vaccines 
in 58 days. Well, so did he follow up 
with a new goal, a truly ambitious one 
that would get us shots in arms even 
faster? Did he set up a new benchmark 
to encourage States to make their vac-
cination efforts more efficient and ef-
fective? Well, not yet. Maybe he will. 
Maybe he will announce a new goal 
this week. For the sake of our country, 
I hope he sets the bar high. 
Given the fact that we are now vacci-
nating about 2.5 million Americans per 
day—a staggering number, really—it is 
time for the administration to take a 
truly bold step. The goal here isn’t to 
set a target you are almost certain to 
meet. After all, you didn’t see the pre-
vious administration set a target of a 
successful vaccine by the summer of 
2021, which is what many experts be-
lieved at the time. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
underpromise, 
overdeliver strategy doesn’t end with 
vaccinations. Just look at the Presi-
dent’s latest comments about small 
outdoor gatherings. In the same speech 
where he tried to take a victory lap for 
the ‘‘disappointingly low bar’’ set for 
vaccinations, he made a rather con-
fusing promise to the American people. 
He said: 
If we keep our guard up, stick together, 
and stick with the science, we can look for-
ward to a Fourth of July that feels a little 
bit more normal with small groups able to 
gather for cookouts in backyards. 
Well, that was a little bit of a head- 
scratcher, when President Biden said 
that he anticipated that everybody 
who wanted the vaccine could get it by 
May, and now he is talking about hav-
ing outdoor gatherings on the Fourth 
of July. 
I can tell you, these small outdoor 
gatherings have been a part of many 
Texans’ routines for almost all year 
now. Families and friends have spent 
time in driveways, backyards, open-air 
spaces, parks. They follow the public 
health guidelines to keep themselves 
and their loved ones safe while man-
aging some sense of normalcy. 
The Centers for Disease Control has 
said it is safe for fully vaccinated indi-
viduals to gather not just outdoors but 
indoors as well. But based on the Presi-
dent’s remarks last week, he is trying 
to frame these gatherings as a reward 
if things go well over the next few 
months. If you do everything right, 
then you might be able to hang out 
with your family in the backyard in 3 
months. Well, the administration’s own 
Centers for Disease Control has already 
told us that these gatherings are safe. 
Your current public health guidelines 
can’t also double as a goal for 31⁄2 
months from now. 
Then there is another big inconsist-
ency between what the experts are tell-
ing us and what the administration is 
doing, and that has to do with reopen-
ing schools. Some children have now 
hit the anniversary mark of virtual 
learning. Studies have shown consist-
ently that this is having a huge nega-
tive impact on America’s kids aca-
demically, mentally, socially, and emo-
tionally. 
We need our schools to reopen, and, 
of course, we need that to happen safe-
ly, which they can. Back in December, 
then President-Elect Biden seemed to 
share that goal. He promised to safely 
reopen the majority of schools within 
his first hundred days in the White

March 23, 2021 
House, another hundred-day goal. The 
experts tell us it is not only possible, 
but it has already been done across the 
country. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention published a report in Janu-
ary that said: 
There has been little evidence that schools 
have contributed meaningfully to increased 
community transmission. 
In short, the schools are not a breed-
ing ground for COVID–19, and as long 
as 
proper 
precautions 
are 
taken, 
schools can reopen safely. In fact, it 
has already happened across most of 
Texas. Nearly two-thirds of Texas 
schools are fully in-person, and just 3 
percent of districts are still fully re-
mote. Two-thirds are fully reopened, 
and 3 percent are fully remote. 
Unfortunately, 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
science is at odds with a key supporter 
of our Democratic colleagues, and that 
is the teachers unions. For months, 
teachers unions have fought a safe re-
turn to in-person instruction even 
though the experts and real-world evi-
dence tell us that it is safe. It has gone 
so far that they have now gotten into 
some pretty sticky situations. 
A 
leaked 
post 
from 
a 
private 
Facebook group for the Los Angeles 
teachers union warned teachers not to 
post pictures of their spring break 
photos because it makes it difficult to 
argue that it is unsafe to return to 
school. Well, it is tough to tell parents 
that it is not safe for their kids to go 
to school and then turn around and tell 
teachers it is fine to go on vacation; 
just 
don’t 
post 
pictures. 
Trusting 
science and listening to the experts 
means doing so all the time, not just 
when it is convenient or politically ex-
pedient. 
We are seeing progress every day in 
our fight against COVID–19. That is the 
light at the end of the tunnel that is 
getting bigger and brighter, and the 
question is not if we get there but 
when. How quickly can we get more 
vaccines into arms? When will our chil-
dren—all our children—return safely to 
the classroom? How long until families 
can hug one another without fear of 
spreading the virus to someone they 
love? 
We all know this is a community ef-
fort. It is a team effort. It is a personal 
responsibility effort. Each of us has a 
role to play in stopping the spread of 
the virus. But leadership matters too. 
The goals and benchmarks set by the 
administration 
will 
determine 
how 
quickly all of these things can happen. 
Now is not the time to walk back 
goals, set low bars, or bow to unions 
and political supporters. The adminis-
tration needs to set clear metrics and 
targets for how we reopen and find our 
new normal, and these goals should be 
based on the science and the advice of 
the experts—nothing less. 
So we are getting close to safely 
crossing 
the 
finish 
line, 
and 
we 
shouldn’t let politics or any other con-
sideration slow us down. 
I yield the floor. 
I would suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 928 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in a mo-
ment, I am going to propound a unani-
mous consent request. But before I do 
so, I want to make some brief observa-
tions. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
Democrats 
passed their extreme partisan rec-
onciliation bill—a bill that President 
Biden signed into law. When the Senate 
was considering the bill, I introduced 
an amendment to ensure that illegal 
aliens would not receive the $1,400 tax-
payer payments provided in the bill. 
Every single Democrat in this body 
voted against that amendment. It 
failed by a single vote. If even one Sen-
ate Democrat had voted for that 
amendment, it would have passed. 
At the time, Senator DURBIN incor-
rectly told this Chamber that no illegal 
aliens would receive stimulus checks 
under this bill. It was clear then, and it 
is even more clear now, that that 
statement was very much in error, as 
even Senator DURBIN has admitted. 
Last Thursday, I gave my Demo-
cratic colleagues a chance for a do- 
over, once it became clear that there 
was a very substantial number of ille-
gal aliens who would be receiving these 
checks. Unfortunately, the Democrats 
objected again and put themselves on 
record that they are just fine with mil-
lions of illegal immigrants getting tax-
payer stimulus checks. 
There has been some debate as to the 
exact number, but, just this week, the 
Center for Immigration Studies re-
leased 
an 
economic 
report 
that 
catalogued that we are indeed talking 
about millions of illegal immigrants 
who are receiving these checks. 
At the same time we were debating 
this partisan reconciliation bill, the 
Senate considered another amendment, 
which I had introduced and Senator 
CASSIDY had introduced, to prevent the 
payments from going to criminals cur-
rently incarcerated in prison. Again, 
unfortunately and astonishingly, every 
single Democrat in this Chamber voted 
against it. It failed by a single vote. If 
even one Democrat had demonstrated 
the common sense to say violent crimi-
nals who are currently in prison right 
now, today, shouldn’t be getting $1,400 
taxpayer stimulus checks, that amend-
ment would have passed. But every 
Democrat lined up in a party-line par-
tisan vote to say no. 
Today, I am going to give Democrats 
another chance at a do-over to recog-
nize that that extreme position is a po-
sition, frankly, none of us could go 
home and explain to our constituents 
without being laughed at, even in the 
bluest of States. And I am going to 
give an opportunity in this instance for 
Democrats to vote on stopping the 
funds going to criminals currently in-
carcerated and sending those funds in-
stead to the Crime Victims Fund, a 
program that is run by the Department 
of Justice to compensate victims of 
crime. 
So this is a choice the Democrats 
have: Do you want $1,400 checks going 
to criminals in prison, or do you want 
instead to direct those funds to the vic-
tims of crime that have suffered at the 
hands of those criminals? 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 928, introduced earlier 
today. I further ask that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just two 
quick points. First, this is not really 
about prisoners. This is about dis-
rupting payments to families all across 
the country who need the money to 
make rent and pay for groceries. 
Here is why. The IRS administers the 
tax system for millions and millions of 
Americans. The Cruz amendment has 
the practical effect of keeping these 
folks who are hurting from getting 
that check that they are going to use 
to pay for essentials. That is because 
their check would be on hold while the 
IRS sets up the system envisioned by 
this amendment. 
Now, I guess that is what my col-
league from Texas wants. After all, he 
opposed the bill. He opposed these pay-
ments from the get-go. So if he passes 
this amendment, he gets what he 
wants, but for all those folks who are 
hurting, their checks are on hold. 
The last point I want to make is that 
it wasn’t always this way for Repub-
licans and our colleague from Texas. 
Republicans were for these payments 
before they were against them. They 
voted for two rounds of relief checks 
going out to all the people who are 
being discussed here when they con-
trolled the White House and the Sen-
ate. 
Senator CRUZ voted for the CARES 
Act. It passed unanimously. There were 
44 Republicans for the December relief 
bill, with no exception like the Senator 
from Texas wants. 
Donald Trump was so happy with the 
checks going to prisoners that he put 
his name on them. The only difference 
between the CARES Act relief checks 
that Republicans unanimously sup-
ported and America Rescue Plan relief 
checks is the party in the White House. 
Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1699 
March 23, 2021 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator 
from 
Oregon, 
I 
guess, 
dem-
onstrates the principle that hypocrisy 
is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, 
because the Senator from Oregon sug-
gests that somehow payments to peo-
ple who are not criminals will be de-
layed if we don’t pay criminals in pris-
on. That claim, on the face of it, is ab-
surd. 
The Federal prisons are administered 
by the Bureau of Prisons. Government 
may not be good at everything, but I 
feel quite confident that the Federal 
Government can produce a list of cur-
rently incarcerated prisoners. I know 
the States can. 
The IRS, likewise, is perfectly capa-
ble of recognizing whether it is mailing 
checks to prisoners in prison. This is 
not whether you have ever been con-
victed of a crime. It is, Are you sending 
the checks to Sing Sing? If so, don’t 
send it. 
The claim that somehow Joe Six- 
Pack at home is not getting his check 
because we don’t want to send checks 
to prisoners is demonstrably untrue. 
The Senator from Oregon also claims 
Republicans oppose stimulus checks, 
when he knows that is simply not the 
case. As he noted, this body over-
whelmingly passed bipartisan COVID 
relief five times last year. It is only 
when Senate Democrats took the ma-
jority that bipartisan legislation ended 
because the Democrats decided to push 
a hard partisan bill instead. 
A clean bill providing relief checks 
would have passed with an over-
whelming bipartisan majority in this 
body, and the Senator from Oregon 
knows that. 
We have now discovered, though, 
that given a straight-up choice be-
tween sending checks to criminals in 
prison versus sending checks to the 
victims of crime, Senate Democrats 
stand with the criminals. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 929 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I am going 
to suggest an even narrower situation. 
Perhaps we can’t agree on victims of 
crime. How about murderers? 
We just had a hearing in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee on gun violence. 
We saw a horrific mass murder in Colo-
rado. Can’t we agree that murderers 
shouldn’t get checks—$1,400 stimulus 
checks—from the taxpayers? Let’s take 
the money going to murderers and put 
it in the crime victims task force fund 
instead. 
And so, Mr. President, as if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S. 929, intro-
duced earlier today. I further ask that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is recognized. 
Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, there isn’t informa-
tion about this crime or these crimes 
at the Federal, State, and local levels. 
So, again, we are back in exactly the 
same place. 
The Senator from Texas wants to 
hold up the checks to millions and mil-
lions of people in spite of the fact that 
he voted—he voted earlier—for a sys-
tem that got the checks to everybody 
in a timely way. And when you don’t 
have the information about the specific 
crimes at the Federal, State, and local 
levels, it becomes impossible to carry 
out what the Senator from Texas seeks 
to do. And the net effect is, again, that 
millions and millions of Americans 
aren’t getting the funds that they need 
to pay for essentials, rent and gro-
ceries. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, you know, 
it could be hard in these partisan days 
to know what the truth is. Both sides 
yell at each other. They insult each 
other. It is hard to know who is telling 
the truth. 
I ask the folks at home who are lis-
tening to this debate to exercise a lit-
tle bit of common sense. The Senator 
from Oregon just told you the Federal 
Government has no idea who are mur-
derers currently in prison. I want to 
suggest that doesn’t make any sense. 
I feel quite confident the Department 
of Justice could produce a list of cur-
rently incarcerated murderers in Fed-
eral prisons within 24 hours. I am abso-
lutely certain the State of Texas could 
produce that list. I am confident the 
State of Connecticut could produce the 
list of the murderers currently in Con-
necticut prisons. I am even confident 
the State of Oregon could produce a 
list of the murderers convicted of 
homicide currently incarcerated in the 
State of Oregon. 
The claim that we don’t know who 
the murderers are who are in our pris-
ons serving time for murder—it doesn’t 
pass the laugh test. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 930 
Mr. President, so let’s see if we could 
agree in a different area—rapists, those 
who committed sexual assault. 
Again, these are public records and 
the Department of Justice and every 
State criminal justice authority have a 
list of all the rapists. How about let’s 
not send $1,400 checks to rapists? Take 
the money and give it to the Crime 
Victims Fund so it can go to victims of 
rape. 
Here is a choice for Democrats: Do 
you want to send money to the rapists 
or the victims of sexual assault? This 
ought 
to 
be 
a 
hundred-or-nothing 
choice. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 930, introduced earlier 
today. I further ask that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to 
read, specifically, what the IRS has 
told us, because I gather my colleague 
would like to just continue this for 
some time. But here is what the IRS 
says: 
In the information the IRS receives from 
the Bureau of Prisons and State prison sys-
tems, we do not get the crime for which the 
person is incarcerated. 
So we can have a host more of these 
amendments, if my colleague wants to 
do it. But I get why he is so anxious to 
have his amendment passed—because 
he was always for keeping people from 
getting checks, and his amendment, if 
passed, would put those checks on hold. 
So that is why I have objected, and we 
will put this into the record as well. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). Objection is heard. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, once again, 
the Senator from Oregon has said 
something that is demonstrably false 
and that he knows is false, which is 
that he has suggested that I opposed 
sending stimulus checks to the Amer-
ican citizens, to law-abiding citizens. I 
not only didn’t oppose it, I voted for it. 
Republicans supported it. He knows 
that. That is a red herring. 
He just read a statement from the 
IRS Agency saying they get a list of 
prisoners from the Bureau of Prisons, 
and he said: But we don’t know the 
crime. 
The first unanimous consent request 
I put before this body is, everyone on 
that list in the Bureau of Prisons, don’t 
send them a check. That doesn’t delay 
your check. If you are not looking at 
bars, if you are not in a jail cell that is 
5 feet by 10 feet, this doesn’t affect you. 
This only affects criminals currently in 
prison. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 931 
Mr. President, let’s try one more 
time. The Democrats have objected to 
not sending checks to criminals in pris-
on. The Democrats have objected to 
not sending checks to murderers in 
prison. The Democrats have objected to 
not sending checks to rapists in prison. 
Let’s try a group that I think may be 
the lowest of the low, which is child 
molesters. I spent a lot of years in law 
enforcement, and I think there is no 
more horrific offense than those who 
commit crimes of violence and sexual 
assault against kids. When I was solic-
itor general of Texas, the cases where 
people sexually abused kids I thought 
should be in Dante’s Ninth Circle of 
Hell. 
So here is a chance for some bipar-
tisan agreement. Can’t we all agree 
that the Federal Government shouldn’t 
send $1,400 checks to the child molest-
ers in prison right now for molesting

kids? And before the Senator from Or-
egon says, ‘‘Who knows who the child 
molesters are,’’ well, the Department 
of Justice and every State department 
of justice knows who the child molest-
ers are in their prisons. 
Let’s take the money that the Demo-
crats want to send to child molesters, 
and let’s take it from the child molest-
ers and give it to the victims of crimes, 
the kids who have been molested. This 
is as simple a legislative choice as I 
can imagine. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 931, introduced earlier 
today. I further ask that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, once 
again, our colleague from Texas is of-
fering an idea that would disrupt the 
system in a way that would keep mil-
lions and millions of Americans who 
are hurting from getting help in a 
timely way. He has come back with, es-
sentially, one version after another be-
cause he thinks that, somehow, this is 
the kind of sensational idea that will 
cause people to rally to his side. 
I believe what he has been pro-
posing—now, I gather, four times—is so 
disruptive, so unworkable that it is 
going to hurt the millions of people 
whom this Congress wanted to help, 
and that is what the Senator from 
Texas has sought to do from the very 
beginning. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there is an 
old saying that you don’t learn any-
thing from the second kick of a mule. 
The first time the Senator from Or-
egon said that I sought to disrupt stim-
ulus payments, perhaps he did so be-
cause he didn’t know my views on that 
topic, but he has since been corrected 
that I voted for stimulus payments to 
American citizens in the time of eco-
nomic crisis and didn’t oppose them. 
So he is now repeatedly stating false-
hoods, knowing that they are false. 
You know, all of us were there when 
Joe Biden gave his inauguration speech 
making a call to unity, making a call 
to healing, and there was a chance we 
could have done that. On COVID relief, 
you don’t have to ask theoretically. 
Last year, when Republicans had con-
trol of the Senate, we passed five bipar-
tisan COVID relief bills, coming to-
gether with overwhelming bipartisan 
majorities. 
The Democrats decided, when they 
took control, they didn’t want to do 
that. You want to know just how far 
out of touch and how radical today’s 
Democratic Party is? We have seen the 
Democrats now say we will send tax-
payer stimulus checks to millions of il-
legal immigrants. We have seen Demo-
crats say we will send the taxpayer 
stimulus to criminals in prison. We 
have seen the Democrats say we will 
send the taxpayer stimulus checks to 
murderers in prison. We have seen 
them say we will send the checks to 
rapists in prison. And we now just saw 
them say we will send the checks to 
child molesters in prison. 
It should be the essence of common 
sense to say don’t give this money to 
violent criminals; give it to victims of 
crime instead. In a sane world, that 
would be a hundred-to-nothing propo-
sition. 
I challenge any one of you in the 
brightest of blue States: Go home and 
explain to your constituents that you 
refused to take the money from child 
molesters and give it to the victims of 
that crime. That is the position of 
every Democrat in this Chamber be-
cause every single Democratic Senator 
was the deciding vote rejecting the 
amendment on the floor. 
It is unfortunate just how extreme 
the hard left is right now, but it is far 
out of touch with the American people, 
and it has long abandoned any sem-
blance of common sense. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Here is what we are for. 
We are for making sure that needy peo-
ple get help to pay for groceries and 
make rent rather than have one of our 
colleagues come out with something 
that is unworkable and disruptive and 
is going to keep those people from get-
ting help. That is what this debate is 
all about, something that is unwork-
able. 
I read the direct comment from the 
IRS with respect to not having the in-
formation or getting help to people 
who are hurting. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from Oregon suggested that the 
concern of the Democrats is to get tax-
payer funds to needy people. People 
currently incarcerated are not needy. 
The Senator from Oregon said we need 
to help Americans struggling with 
rent. You know what? People currently 
incarcerated pay zero in rent. They 
don’t have rent costs. 
So the argument of the Democrats is: 
We don’t know who the criminals are 
who are currently in jail. That does not 
comport with reality, and any fair-
minded person watching this knows 
that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
STUDENTS FOR FAIR ADMISSIONS V. HARVARD 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am 
sure you have been to Paris. The archi-
tect, as you undoubtedly know, who de-
signed the Louvre’s iconic glass pyr-
amid was actually an American. He 
was an Asian American. His name was 
I.M. Pei. Mr. Pei emigrated from China 
to the United States in the 1930s. 
By the time he passed at the age of 
102, he had designed a number of fa-
mous buildings. He had done that all 
across the world, including on U.S. 
soil, including the John F. Kennedy 
Presidential Library. 
America is proud of Mr. Pei. He is 
just one of millions of Asian Americans 
whose talents have helped America 
continue to be an exceptional nation, a 
nation made up of exceptional people 
who take advantage of all of the oppor-
tunities that these United States have 
to offer. 
The contributions of individual Asian 
Americans have helped our country 
pioneer—and 
the 
Presiding 
Officer 
knows this—advances in architecture, 
in medicine, in art, and in technology. 
But, more than that, Asian Americans 
are our friends, and they are our neigh-
bors. 
The recent murder of Asian-Amer-
ican women in an evil assault in At-
lanta was an assault not just on the 
Atlanta community but on the United 
States of America. President Biden has 
correctly denounced these attacks, and 
he is not alone. 
I know the Presiding Officer can join 
me in this. I condemn these evil mur-
ders in the strongest possible terms. No 
one can justify—no one—the brutal 
theft of eight lives. Every commu-
nity—every 
single 
one—across 
our 
country is grieving for the victims and 
is grieving for the families. 
These victims were all made, they 
were each made, in God’s image, and 
Americans know that. I also feel the 
same way about the shooting in Boul-
der. We all do. 
America pioneered government that 
is based on inalienable rights that God 
gives each person. God has imbued 
every man and woman with dignity, 
and Americans answer that dignity 
with respect, respect for each indi-
vidual and their right to make the 
most of the manifold opportunities our 
country offers. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s 
rhetoric in defense of the Asian-Amer-
ican community is not altogether 
matched by respect for the right of 
Asian Americans to reap the reward of 
their talent and grit. 
The Biden administration, thus far— 
it has time to correct its course—has 
shown and did show right out of the 
gate a determination to stick its head 
in the sand while some of America’s 
top universities are actively discrimi-
nating against Asian Americans. 
Last year, as the Presiding Officer 
knows, the Justice Department sued 
Yale University. The Justice Depart-
ment contended that Yale rejected 
many qualified Asian-American appli-
cants on the basis of race—not on the 
basis of qualification, on the basis of 
race. 
The decision by the Justice Depart-
ment came 2 years after several Asian- 
American organizations filed a com-
plaint with the Department of Justice

March 23, 2021 
and the Department of Education that 
accused Yale of what I just described: 
racial discrimination. 
Yet only a few weeks—only a few 
weeks after President Biden set up 
shop in the Oval Office, the Depart-
ment of Justice withdrew its own law-
suit based on racial discrimination 
against Yale University, and that is an 
actual fact. Watch what we say, not 
what we do. 
Unfortunately, Harvard University 
also seems determined to discriminate 
against Asian-American applicants. In 
2014, Students for Fair Admissions sued 
Harvard, claiming that the school was 
using an application system that inten-
tionally reduces the number of Asian 
Americans through evaluations that 
are subjective and potentially racially 
biased. 
You see, Harvard apparently believes 
it knows how to discriminate in the 
right way. It believed the same thing a 
number of years ago when it limited 
the number of Jewish people who could 
attend Harvard. 
When Harvard considers an appli-
cant, the school doesn’t just look at 
their grades or their test scores or 
their academic awards. In fact, the ad-
missions team at Harvard often looks 
past these objective indicators to a stu-
dent’s—this is what Harvard calls it— 
personal ratings, which is an unfair, ri-
diculous, and a subjective standard. 
These personal ratings, as Harvard 
calls them, supposedly take into ac-
count character traits like humor, sen-
sitivity, helpfulness, and courage. For 
years, Harvard has consistently grant-
ed lower personal ratings scores to 
Asian Americans than it has to other 
applicants, and that, too, is a fact. 
The judge in the Students for Fair 
Admissions’ lawsuit wrote the fol-
lowing: 
The data demonstrates— 
These are the judge’s words, not 
mine. 
The data demonstrates a statistically sig-
nificant and negative relationship between 
Asian American identity and the personal 
rating assigned by Harvard admissions offi-
cers, holding constant any reasonable set of 
observable characteristics. 
I didn’t say that; the judge in the 
case did. 
Now, I want to be fair. It may look 
smart or wise for Harvard to look for 
well-rounded applicants—I get that— 
until you realize and think about that 
these personal ratings are not just sub-
jective; they are subversive. If you 
think 
about 
it, 
the 
scores, 
these 
scores—they are not objective like test 
scores or grades or extracurricular ac-
tivities; these personal ratings are 
value judgments that can easily be 
tainted by racial bias. It is clear that 
the personal ratings minimize the ac-
complishments of Asian Americans in 
particular. 
Just look at the numbers. Harvard’s 
admission scores work like this: They 
use a scale of 1 to 6. One is the strong-
est possible rating. When it comes to 
personal ratings—remember, this is the 
subjective analysis of the personhood 
of the applicant by Harvard, not the 
test scores, not the grades, not the ex-
tracurricular activities. When it comes 
to personal ratings, only 17.6 percent of 
Asian-American applicants receive a 
score of 1 or 2—17.6 for Asian Ameri-
cans. For African Americans, that 
number is 19.01 percent. For Hispanic 
Americans, it is 18.7 percent. In fact— 
and these are the numbers—Harvard 
gives Asian Americans the weakest 
personal ratings of any ethnic group, 
bar none. 
Harvard admissions officials have re-
portedly handed out these scores with-
out even interviewing all of the can-
didates in question—personal ratings 
without interviewing the applicants. 
This happens now despite the fact that 
Asian Americans have the highest 
grades and test scores. So on the objec-
tive 
criteria—test 
scores, 
grades— 
Asian Americans have the highest 
scores. What pulls them down? The per-
sonal ratings. 
Harvard officials admitted in 2013 
that if Harvard considered only aca-
demic achievement, then proportional 
Asian-American 
representation 
that 
year would have doubled. Think about 
that. If Harvard went on the objective 
criteria—extracurricular 
activities, 
grades, test scores—twice as many 
Asian Americans would have been ad-
mitted to the university. Why weren’t 
they? Because of the personal ratings. 
They call it ‘‘personal’’ even though 
many of the applicants are never even 
interviewed. 
The Department of Justice has his-
torically supported the Students for 
Fair Admissions lawsuit. In 2018, the 
Justice Department filed a statement 
of interest in the case. Last year, the 
Justice Department filed an amicus 
brief in the case. A Federal judge ruled 
against the plaintiffs in 2019 in the 
case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
First Circuit upheld that decision last 
November—this despite the fact that 
the Federal district court judge in the 
case openly acknowledged that Har-
vard grants lower personal ratings 
scores to Asian-American applicants. 
The fruits of Harvard’s policy are 
pretty clear. You don’t have to be 
Mensa material to figure this out. The 
Ivy League school has repeatedly re-
jected highly qualified Asian-American 
candidates because of their race. 
But there is still hope for justice for 
our Asian-American students. The Su-
preme Court may well take up this 
case, and the White House could defend 
the cause of merit against Harvard’s 
alleged racial discrimination. 
So let me say this as clearly as I can. 
If President Biden—if the Biden team 
is committed to fighting racial dis-
crimination against Asian Americans, 
if President Biden and his team want 
to lift up Asian Americans, as they say 
they do, it is not hard to see how coun-
tering racist policies within the privi-
leged halls of Harvard—a school that 
receives Federal dollars—it is not hard 
to see how supporting that litigation 
must be part of President Biden’s com-
mitment. So today, with all the respect 
I can muster, I am calling on President 
Biden and his Justice Department to 
support the Asian-American students 
who have brought their case against 
Harvard. 
Harvard is an extraordinary school. 
Nothing I say is meant to denigrate the 
quality of that great university. But 
being a pillar of higher education 
doesn’t mean that Harvard is above the 
law. I.M. Pei attended Harvard in the 
1940s. Who knows if they would accept 
him today because of his personal rat-
ing. You know, that is a shame, and it 
shouldn’t stand. 
President Biden should stand up for 
the rights of Asian Americans to be 
treated fairly by America’s schools. His 
Justice Department should support 
this lawsuit. 
To be is to act. All we are is the sum 
of our actions. Everything else is just 
conversation. Don’t just talk about 
supporting Asian Americans; do it. Do 
it. Please don’t be selective in the re-
ality you choose to accept. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO SENIOR LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL NGUYEN CHI VINH 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to 
pay tribute to one of Vietnam’s highest 
ranking military officers, Senior Lieu-
tenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh. 
General Vinh, who has served as 
Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of National 
Defense since 2009, has played an indis-
pensable role in the reconciliation be-
tween Vietnam and the United States. 
After more than four decades of mili-
tary service, he is finally nearing re-
tirement from the Ministry of National 
Defense. 
General Vinh was born in 1957. He 
studied at the Institute of Military 
Technology before embarking on his 
long and distinguished career in the Vi-
etnamese People’s Army. His father, 
General Nguyen Chi Thanh, came from 
a humble family and rose to become a 
decorated military officer and politi-
cian. Today, one of Hanoi’s main thor-
oughfares bears his name. 
As someone who lived through the 
Vietnam war era, I remember it a ca-
tastrophe for both countries. The more 
than 58,000 American soldiers and other 
servicemembers who died, whose names 
are etched in the granite Vietnam Vet-
erans Memorial, are only part of the 
story. We remember their families and 
the many tens of thousands who re-
turned home with severe disabilities. 
In Vietnam, virtually no family was 
unscathed. Hundreds of thousands are 
still missing among the estimated 3 
million Vietnamese who died. The ma-
jority were civilians, whose families 
suffered grievous losses and severe 
hardships as the fighting raged around 
them. Many of their stories remain un-
told. 
In the decades since, memories of 
that time have faded and the world’s 
attention has turned elsewhere. Yet 
during the past quarter century since 
the normalization of relations with 
Vietnam, there has been a sustained ef-
fort by both countries to address some 
of the worst legacies of the war. By 
doing so, we have built a new partner-
ship and set an example for other 
former enemies. 
It began in the late 1980s with the 
first use of the Leahy War Victims 
Fund by the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development, USAID, to as-
sist people with severe war-related dis-
abilities. That was authorized by Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush, after he and I 
discussed the need to assist Viet-
namese who had been injured during 
the war. It led to funding by the State 
Department to locate and destroy 
unexploded 
landmines 
and 
bombs, 
which litter the Vietnamese country-
side and have maimed and killed tens 
of thousands of innocent people, in-
cluding children, since the war ended. 
Nearly 15 years ago, those war legacy 
programs expanded to address the cruel 
legacy of Agent Orange, and it is in 
this that General Vinh and I became 
acquainted. 
Since then, General Vinh has been 
my principal Vietnamese counterpart 
in working to address the legacy of 
dioxin contamination at former U.S. 
military bases and the needs of Viet-
namese with severe physical and cog-
nitive disabilities resulting from expo-
sure to dioxin. I consider him a friend 
and am grateful for the hospitality he 
has shown me, my wife Marcelle, and 
other Senators when we have visited 
Vietnam. 
From 1961 to 1971, the U.S. Air Force 
sprayed nearly 19 million gallons of 
herbicides in Vietnam, of which at 
least 11 million gallons were Agent Or-
ange, in an effort to defoliate trees and 
shrubs and kill agricultural crops that 
were providing cover and food to North 
Vietnamese soldiers. Decades later, we 
learned that the Agent Orange was 
contaminated with dioxin, which can 
cause problems with reproduction, de-
velopment, and the immune system. 
Dioxin can disrupt hormones and lead 
to cancer. It is also a persistent pollut-
ant that can remain in the environ-
ment for many years. 
Millions of Vietnamese were exposed, 
and hundreds of thousands suffered se-
vere physical and cognitive disabil-
ities. My wife Marcelle and I have met 
three generations of Agent Orange vic-
tims, from young children to their par-
ents and grandparents. Hundreds of 
thousands of Americans who served in 
Vietnam were also exposed, and thou-
sands have been battling cancers for 
years. 
Fortunately, thanks to studies fund-
ed by the Ford Foundation, it was pos-
sible to identify key ‘‘hotspots’’ with 
significant contamination, and work-
ing closely with General Vinh and 
USAID, we cleaned up the contami-
nated soil and sediment at the former 
U.S. airbase in Da Nang. Seven years 
and $110 million dollars later, it is once 
again a busy commercial airport. In 
fact, Air Force One landed there in 
2017, when President Trump visited 
Vietnam. That project would not have 
been possible without the leadership 
and perseverance of General Nguyen 
Chi Vinh, and I will never forget vis-
iting the site with him when we for-
mally launched the project in 2014. 
Since then, we have moved on to 
Bien Hoa, on the outskirts of Ho Chi 
Minh City, the site of the largest U.S. 
airbase during the war where Agent Or-
ange was stored and loaded onto air-
planes. Today it is a shadow of what it 
once was, and it is contaminated with 
dioxin that has been leaching into the 
nearby Dong Nai River for half a cen-
tury. 
In 2019, General Vinh and I, along 
with Deputy Prime Minister Truong 
Hoa Binh and U.S. Ambassador Daniel 
Kritenbrink, and in the presence of 
eight other U.S. Senators, inaugurated 
a joint U.S.-Vietnam project to clean 
up Bien Hoa, including a U.S. commit-
ment to contribute $300 million over 10 
years, half from the U.S. Department 
of Defense and half from USAID. I had 
several conversations with Secretary of 
Defense James Mattis about Bien Hoa, 
and the Pentagon’s contribution is the 
result of his recognition that we have a 
responsibility and a national interest 
in helping Vietnam address war legacy 
issues. 
At the same time, USAID launched a 
5-year, $65 million effort to expand our 
health and disability programs, which 
are being implemented in eight prov-
inces that were sprayed with Agent Or-
ange. 
Over more than four decades, the 
Government of Vietnam has provided 
essential access and support in locating 
the remains of hundreds of American 
MIAs. This year, we are embarking on 
a 5-year, $15 million program, jointly 
funded by the U.S. Department of De-
fense and USAID, to help the Viet-
namese locate and identify some of 
their own people missing or killed dur-
ing the war. 
Much has been written, and I suspect 
more will be, about the collaboration 
between our two countries in address-
ing the legacies of the Vietnam war. 
Issues that for years were a cause of 
anger and resentment are today exam-
ples of how two former enemies can 
work together for the betterment of 
the people of both countries. These 
projects opened the door for the United 
States and Vietnam to cooperate on a 
wide array of other issues, from cli-
mate change and wildlife trafficking, 
to public health and regional security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1703 
March 23, 2021 
Tens of thousands of Vietnamese stu-
dents are studying in the United 
States, and we are supporting institu-
tions of higher education in Vietnam. 
This has been possible because of the 
efforts of many people over many 
years. Senators John McCain and John 
Kerry played an instrumental role in 
the normalization of relations. By 
doing so, they set the stage for both 
countries to build trust based on mu-
tual respect by addressing sensitive 
war legacy issues, which Ambassadors 
of both countries have also strongly 
encouraged. 
It is in this that Senior Lieutenant 
General Nguyen Chi Vinh has built his 
own legacy. The partnership that has 
developed from our cooperation on war 
legacies and which today extends to 
programs jointly funded and imple-
mented by Vietnam’s Ministry of De-
fense and the U.S. Department of De-
fense would not have been possible 
without General Vinh’s vision, his 
leadership, and his good will. For that 
we owe him our lasting appreciation 
and respect.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, on Mon-
day, March 15, due to a snowstorm in 
Denver, I was unable to travel to Wash-
ington in time for the vote to confirm 
Deb Haaland to serve as Secretary of 
Interior. Had I been present, I would 
have voted to confirm her to serve in 
this important position. 
f 
REMEMBERING JOSEPH MARTIN 
ROSE, SR. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. Joseph Martin Rose, Sr., Moka’ang 
Giizis or ‘‘Rising Sun’’ in the Ojibwe 
language, a beloved elder and member 
of the Eagle Clan of the Bad River 
Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. As a 
member of the Three Fires Midewiwin 
Grand Medicine Lodge, Joe was a 
teacher, culture keeper, pipe carrier, 
and treasure to his community. His life 
was one of far too many claimed by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Joe was born on April 24, 1935, to Carl 
Rose, Sr., and Mary ‘‘Dolly’’ (Jackson) 
Rose in Oklahoma. When his father 
volunteered to repair naval ships in 
Alaska during World War II, his moth-
er brought the family back home to 
Odanah to live with her parents on the 
Bad River Native American Reserva-
tion. Joe often told stories about grow-
ing up in Odanah, calling it a ‘‘time of 
kerosene lamps, outhouses, and wood 
heat.’’ He credited his grandfather, Dan 
Jackson, with instilling in him a 
strong connection to the natural world 
by teaching him about traditional 
plants, ceremonies, and medicines. He 
spent his youth netting fish in the 
spring, wild ricing in late summer, 
duck hunting in the fall, then ice skat-
ing and enjoying bonfires in the winter. 
He attended DePadua High School in 
Ashland, where he played nose tackle 
on the football team, wrestled, and 
sang 
in 
the 
school 
choir. 
His 
athleticism earned him a scholarship 
to Northland College, where he ma-
jored in biology and secondary edu-
cation, earning a certification to teach 
high school science and math. After 
graduation, he spent the next 10 years 
teaching in South Dakota and Wyo-
ming, while coaching youth sports. 
With the help of his parents, he raised 
two children, taught full time, and 
earned a master’s degree in guidance 
counseling before returning to Bad 
River in 1970. 
Back in Wisconsin, he became the 
homeschool coordinator and guidance 
counselor at Ashland High School. As 
an advocate for Bad River children, he 
taught them Native American arts and 
crafts and offered courses about cul-
ture. In 1974, he was asked to develop 
the newly formed Native American 
Studies Program at Northland College, 
one of the first such programs in Amer-
ica. As its director, he created a cul-
ture-based curriculum that emphasized 
environmental stewardship and the 
connection Ojibwe people have with 
Lake Superior. 
Joe’s experiential learning courses 
were memorable for the visits to his 
home on Waverly Beach, birch bark ca-
noes, ceremonial lodges, and a round 
house built by his students. He helped 
create the Traditional Ways Gathering, 
an annual event celebrating Ojibwe 
crafts such as beading, basket making, 
and flintknapping. He formed a rela-
tionship with the recently dedicated 
David R. Obey Northern Great Lakes 
Visitor Center in Ashland and curated 
its exhibits on Lake Superior tribal 
history and culture. 
As a staunch defender of Native 
American treaty rights, Joe and his 
son, Joe Dan, were among Lake Supe-
rior Ojibwe who exercised their rights 
to spearfish lakes in the ceded terri-
tory. They did so in the face of some-
times violent demonstrations in oppo-
sition to those rights. He later served 
on the Voigt Intertribal Task Force, 
which facilitates the cooperative man-
agement of shared natural resources in 
ceded territory. 
Joe retired as an associate professor 
in 2007, although he continued to teach 
and serve in leadership roles until the 
end of his life. Even after retirement, 
Joe continued his activism against en-
vironmental threats facing Lake Supe-
rior, including nuclear waste, oil explo-
ration, 
garbageincineration, 
factory 
farming, and taconite mining in the 
Penokee Hills. His most recent fight 
was against the Enbridge Line 5 oil 
pipeline that crosses the Bad River res-
ervation, one of his primary issues of 
concern as a member of the Ashland 
County Board. One way or another, Joe 
was a part of virtually every signifi-
cant environmental and treaty-rights 
struggle in the region over the past 
half century. 
While soft-spoken, Joe had a voice 
that proved powerful and deeply reso-
nant. He believed that he had the re-
sponsibility to ‘‘go out and share this 
knowledge and wisdom of how to live 
in harmony and balance with the nat-
ural world.’’ With this ethos and an in-
domitable faith in grassroots orga-
nizing, he never turned down an oppor-
tunity fight the good fight and share 
his knowledge with others. The count-
less people who were fortunate enough 
to know and learn from Joe Rose, Sr., 
will keep his memory alive and con-
tinue his good work for generations to 
come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE KINDRED HIGH 
SCHOOL VIKINGS 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, my 
State enjoys many legendary sports ri-
valries. But make no mistake about it, 
the Class B Boys High School Basket-
ball Tournament played every March 
is, without question, North Dakota’s 
premier sporting event. This year, 108 
teams began the basketball season in 
16 districts and 8 regions. The regional 
champions met the third weekend of 
March to compete for the State title. 
Every year, these games draw the at-
tention of the entire State, along with 
fans from across the Nation, all of 
whom claim a connection with at least 
one of the competing teams. 
This week, I stand a little taller as a 
proud 1979 graduate of Kindred High 
School. The Kindred Vikings won their 
first-ever boys basketball State cham-
pionship title in Minot Saturday night, 
defeating the Edgeley-Kulm-Montpe-
lier Rebels 40–34. Their 21–4 season was 
capped with impressive tournament 
matchups, where the Vikings show-
cased their agility and skill against 
some of the best basketball players in 
the State. In their semi-final victory 
against 
Four 
Winds-Minnewaukan, 
Kindred’s Matthew Pearson sunk six 
three-pointers to score 18 points, as 
Paul Olson scored 15 points and Jaiden 
Peraza 10. In the championship game, 
Paul Olson scored 23 points, making 8 
of 15 shots and 8 rebounds. Paul, 
Jaiden, and Gavin Keller were the Vi-
kings named to the all-tournament 
team. 
I want to recognize this year’s team 
members: Brock Woehl, Cole Campbell, 
Ethan McKenney, Jeremiah Dockter, 
Matthew Pearson, Jorgen Swensen, 
Elijah Heinrich, Paul Olson, Maxwell 
McQuillan, 
Trey 
Heinrich, 
Jaiden 
Peraza, Chase Miller, Gavin Keller, 
Presley Peraza, and Riley Sunram, 
along with manager Jack Davis and 
statisticians Rylie Ranking, Leah Rol-
land, and Zoe Sharp. 
As a Kindred High School student 
athlete who lettered 4 years in football, 
basketball, and track, I realize my high 
school skills would not qualify me to 
be the ball boy for this year’s squad. I 
congratulate the team, as well as 
Coach Brad Woehl, his assistants Scott 
Milbrandt, Matt Hagen, and Jimmy 
Hoy, and the hometown fans on win-
ning this championship. I join the rest

REMEMBERING ANDY HOFFMAN 
∑ Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I first 
met Andy Hoffman at a chili cook off 
in Butte, NE, in October of 2004. I was 
running for my first term in the Ne-
braska Legislature. I was walking from 
group to group, talking with the cooks 
and tasting their chili, when I came 
upon a young man in jean overalls. I 
introduced myself, and we ended up 
talking for over 30 minutes. 
Actually, it would be more accurate 
to say he ‘‘grilled’’ me for over 30 min-
utes with a smile on his face. He was 
kind, and he later became a supporter 
and a dear friend. 
We stayed in touch during my 8 years 
in the unicameral. Never one to keep 
strongly held opinions to himself, Andy 
would call me every now and then to 
tell me how he felt about bills in the 
legislature. When I decided to run for 
U.S. Senate, I asked him to serve as 
one of my county chairs. 
Andy agreed, but a few weeks later, 
his son Jack was diagnosed with brain 
cancer. Jack was just 5 years old at the 
time. 
Andy and his wife, Bri, had their 
lives turned upside down. But instead 
of giving up, they supported Jack every 
step of the way as he fought cancer. 
And they started the Team Jack Foun-
dation in his honor, which helps fund 
pediatric brain cancer research and 
raise awareness about this terrible dis-
ease. Andy spent the years since Jack’s 
diagnosis traveling the country and ap-
pearing on national television, where 
he spoke about how important this 
funding is for children like Jack. 
Like most Nebraskans, Jack loves 
Husker football. In 2013, his favorite 
player, Rex Burkhead, invited him to 
join the team for their annual spring 
game. Jack won Best Moment at the 
ESPY Awards that year when he ran 69 
yards for a fourth-quarter touchdown 
and into the hearts of millions of peo-
ple around the world. ‘‘Sports Illus-
trated’’ even made him one of their five 
nominees for Sportsman of the Year. 
Jack and Rex were kind enough to sign 
their jerseys for me, and I still have 
them hanging in my office today. 
To recognize the Hoffman family’s 
heroic efforts, I was pleased to work 
with the White House to arrange an 
Oval Office visit with President Obama 
for Jack and the Hoffmans. And at that 
same time, I led a U.S. Senate resolu-
tion making Jack’s birthday, Sep-
tember 26, National Pediatric Brain 
Cancer Awareness Day. 
Andy was relentless in bringing at-
tention to this disease. Under Andy’s 
leadership, Team Jack has raised over 
$8.4 million to help make sure no child 
has to go through what Jack has. He 
even 
published 
a 
book 
last 
year, 
‘‘Yards After Contact’’, about Jack’s 
fight. 
Andy led a successful law practice 
with offices in Atkinson, O’Neill, and 
Central City. He was also a passionate 
runner, even qualifying for the Boston 
Marathon in 2014. And he was espe-
cially fond of hunting, fishing, and 
spending all the time he could out-
doors. 
Andy passed away on March 1, at age 
42, after his own hard-fought battle 
with glioblastoma, an extremely ag-
gressive type of brain cancer. Our 
State lost a remarkable Nebraskan. His 
wife, Bri, and three children, Jack, 
Ava, and Reese, lost a loving husband 
and father, and Bruce and I lost a won-
derful friend. 
We are heartbroken that Andy is 
gone, but we take comfort in the fact 
that his legacy will live on through the 
incredible work of the Team Jack 
Foundation. 
The world is a better place today be-
cause of Andy’s life. At the end of the 
day, I think that is all that any of us 
can ask for. 
I ask that you join me in honoring 
Andy’s life. Please keep the Hoffman 
family in your prayers.∑

TRIBUTE TO FAY BRICKMAN 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I would like to wish Ms. Fay 
Brickman of Charleston, SC, a very 
happy and healthy 100th birthday. 
Ms. 
Brickman 
married 
her 
high 
school sweetheart, Jack, after he re-
turned from serving in World War II. 
They were married for 70 years before 
his passing. Together, they touched the 
lives of countless people in their com-
munity 
by 
generously 
supporting 
Charleston’s academic institutions and 
consistently devoting time to their 
synagogue, Brith Shalom Beth Israel, 
where Fay was the president of the sis-
terhood. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
recognize 
Ms. 
Brickman for the impact she made on 
our State and the legacy she built 
through her work and family. She is 
blessed with six brilliant children, all 
of whom hold law degrees, and 11 
grandchildren, who visit regularly. I 
wish the family a wonderful time as 
they gather to celebrate Fay’s 100th 
birthday.∑

TRIBUTE TO DALE GILBERT 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, today I would like to take a 
moment to recognize the great work of 
Dale Gilbert. Mr. Gilbert served as a 
meteorologist for nearly 25 years at 
WYFF–TV, which is a local station in 
Greenville, SC. 
Dale Gilbert began his career at 
WYFF in the early 70s, becoming one of 
the youngest people on the air for the 
network. During his time at WYFF, he 
received many awards, including the 
South Carolina Broadcasters Associa-
tion Masters Award. Mr. Gilbert was 
well loved by his community, and will 
be missed for the local legend that he 
has become.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE): 
S. 907. A bill to amend the Magnuson- 
Stevens 
Fishery 
Conservation 
and 
Management Act to add Rhode Island 
to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Manage-
ment Council, and for other purposes; 
to 
the 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
reintroducing the Rhode Island Fisher-
men’s Fairness Act along with my col-
league Senator WHITEHOUSE. This legis-
lation seeks to address a longstanding 
inequity in our nation’s fisheries man-
agement system that denies Rhode Is-
land a voice in the management of 
many stocks that our fishing industry 
relies on. 
Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
Rhode Island has voting membership 
on the New England Fishery Manage-
ment Council (NEFMC) since NEFMC- 
managed stocks represent a significant 
percentage of landings and revenue for 
our state. However, Rhode Island has 
an even larger stake in Mid-Atlantic 
fisheries. Yet, it does not have voting 
representation on the Mid-Atlantic 
Fishery 
Management 
Council 
(MAFMC), which currently consists of 
representatives from New York, New 
Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Mary-
land, Virginia, and North Carolina.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1710 
March 23, 2021 
2019, Rhode Island accounted for ap-
proximately a quarter of the commer-
cial 
landings 
from 
stocks 
under 
MAFMC’s sole jurisdiction, both by 
weight and value. The significance of 
commercial landings from stocks man-
aged by MAFMC is growing every year 
for Rhode Island, accounting for 58% of 
Rhode Island’s federally managed com-
mercial fisheries landings in 2019. 
After making an appearance during 
last summer’s Democratic National 
Convention, Rhode Island calamari 
quickly became a social media sensa-
tion, and for good reason. Calamari (or 
squid) is by far the most important 
commercial species in the Ocean State. 
In 2019 alone, Rhode Island landed over 
5.5 million more pounds of squid than 
any other state on the East Coast. But, 
Rhode Island does not have a formal 
say in how this species is managed be-
cause it does not have representation 
on the MAFMC. 
The legislation we are introducing of-
fers a simple solution with a sound 
precedent. North Carolina was added to 
the MAFMC as part of the Sustainable 
Fisheries Act in 1996. Like Rhode Is-
land, a significant portion of North 
Carolina’s landed fish species were 
managed by the MAFMC, yet the state 
was not represented on the council. 
Just like the 1996 law that added 
North Carolina, the Rhode Island Fish-
ermen’s Fairness Act would create two 
seats for our state on the MAFMC. One 
seat would be appointed by the Sec-
retary of Commerce based on rec-
ommendations from the Governor of 
Rhode Island, and a second seat would 
be filled by Rhode Island’s principal 
state official with marine fishery man-
agement responsibility. To accommo-
date these new members, the bill would 
increase the MAFMC from 21 to 23 vot-
ing members. This would guarantee 
Rhode Island the same minimum rep-
resentation as other states currently 
on the council, without altering their 
status. 
With mounting economic, ecological, 
and regulatory challenges, it is more 
important than ever that Rhode Island 
fishermen have a voice in the manage-
ment of the fisheries they depend on. I 
urge our colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this commonsense legislation. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, and 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina): 
S. 912. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to provide in-
formation regarding vaccines for sen-
iors as part of the Medicare & You 
handbook and to ensure that the treat-
ment of cost sharing for vaccines under 
Medicare part D is consistent with the 
treatment of vaccines under Medicare 
part B, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a bill that will help 
to improve adult vaccination rates 
throughout this country. I am thankful 
to Senators CAPITO, WHITEHOUSE, and 
SCOTT of South Carolina for their part-
nership on this important legislation. 
Before there were vaccines, nearly 
everyone got measles, and diseases like 
whooping cough, polio, and rubella 
were commonplace among children and 
adults. Luckily for us, vaccines are 
now a cornerstone of our nation’s dis-
ease prevention efforts. They have a 
demonstrated 
record 
limiting 
the 
spread of debilitating and potentially 
deadly conditions—from measles to flu 
to pneumonia—saving lives and reduc-
ing health care costs. A successful vac-
cination campaign is also essential to 
fully reopening society and preventing 
future COVID–19 outbreaks. 
Unfortunately, adult vaccines rates 
are not nearly as high as they could 
and should be. Prior to the pandemic, 
more than 50,000 adults per year died 
from vaccine-preventable diseases in 
the United States, while millions more 
became ill as a result, causing them to 
miss work and leaving some unable to 
care for those who depend on them. 
The health care costs associated with 
low adult vaccine rates are enormous— 
each year, the U.S. spends $15 billion 
treating Medicare beneficiaries alone 
for these vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Because the immune system deterio-
rates as people age, adults 50 and over 
are especially susceptible to many vac-
cine-preventable diseases and account 
for 
a 
disproportionate 
number 
of 
deaths and illnesses from these disease. 
As Americans age, the impact of these 
diseases and their complications is 
likely to grow—unless we quickly and 
substantially improve use of and access 
to adult vaccines, especially among 
Medicare beneficiaries. 
By increasing vaccine access, we can 
save thousands of lives and potentially 
billions of dollars. Unfortunately, older 
adults seeking access to and coverage 
for vaccines encounter many barriers. 
They may not know where or how to 
get vaccinated and cost can be an ob-
stacle for both patients and providers. 
That’s why we’ve introduced the Pro-
tecting Seniors Through Immunization 
Act of 2021. The bill improves vaccine 
information and education for Medi-
care beneficiaries, including the risks 
and consequences of vaccine-prevent-
able disease, and ensures older adults 
know what vaccines are right for them 
at the right time. 
The bill also eliminates the cost bur-
den of vaccines on our nation’s aging 
population. Vaccines are available for 
free under private insurance, but under 
Medicare, vaccine coverage is split be-
tween Medicare Part B and Medicare 
Part D. Seniors can access vaccines 
covered under Part B—such as flu, 
pneumonia 
and 
Hepatitis—with 
no 
cost-sharing. However, vaccines cov-
ered under Part D, such as shingles 
(herpes zoster) and pertussis (Tdap), 
can include a wide range of cost-shar-
ing requirements. For seniors, many of 
whom live on fixed incomes such as So-
cial Security benefits, these additional 
costs may preclude them from being 
vaccinated. 
A 2018 study of Tdap and herpes 
zoster vaccine claims under Medicare 
Part D demonstrated that higher out- 
of-pocket cost-sharing is associated 
with higher rates of cancelled vaccina-
tion claims—in other words, when the 
costs of vaccines are too high, seniors 
can’t or won’t get them. The study 
found that cost-sharing of $51 or great-
er is associated with a 2 to 2.7-times 
greater rate of cancelled vaccination 
claims compared with $0 cost-sharing. 
There are more than 300,000 cases of 
shingles reported in the U.S. each year. 
About 50 percent of people who experi-
ence shingles will have postherpetic 
neuralgia, a debilitating, painful, and 
long-lasting disease. This is just one 
example of the types of conditions that 
vaccines can prevent. 
We have a lot of room for improve-
ment for uptake of these vaccines. 
Passing 
the 
Protecting 
Seniors 
Through Immunization Act of 2021 will 
help us to do so. By reducing cost bar-
riers and improving access and raising 
awareness, we can implement these 
vaccines better and set the stage for 
healthy aging. 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, Mr. REED, and Ms. 
WARREN): 
S. 913. A bill to conduct a study on 
the 
spread 
of 
COVID–19-related 
disinformation and misinformation on 
the internet and social media plat-
forms, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
introduce 
the 
COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act. I thank Representative JEN-
NIFER WEXTON for working with me on 
this important piece of legislation, 
which will help shine a light on the 
ways social media and other online 
platforms amplify and spread misin-
formation and disinformation about 
the coronavirus pandemic to the det-
riment of public health. I also thank 
my 
colleagues—Senators 
BOOKER, 
BLUMENTHAL, KLOBUCHAR, WARREN, and 
REED—for cosponsoring this bill. 
As I stand here today nearly 30 mil-
lion Americans have been diagnosed 
with COVID–19 and over 540,000 have 
died from the virus. 
The numbers alone are staggering. 
But when you hear and read the per-
sonal stories of individuals and fami-
lies who are suffering, it is truly trag-
ic. It makes you mournful that for 
many of the individuals who died, they 
died alone in the absence of their loved 
ones. 
While many things contributed to 
this massive loss of life, I am here to 
talk about one in particular: the insid-
ious spread of coronavirus-related mis-
information and disinformation online. 
This ‘‘infodemic’’ has undercut the ef-
forts of public health officials at every 
turn, and threatens to prolong the 
virus’s impact on the health of our peo-
ple and economy long after a safe and 
effective vaccine is available. 
The online spread of misinformation 
about public health is nothing new.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1711 
March 23, 2021 
Claims that the 2014 Ebola epidemic 
was a form of population control 
spread across social media. Anti-vac-
cination 
groups 
have 
long 
used 
Facebook and YouTube to share junk 
science and recruit new members. 
However, social media platforms’ re-
sponse to coronavirus was supposed to 
be different. Early in the pandemic, the 
major 
social 
media 
platforms 
an-
nounced new measures to combat mis-
information while making sure users 
had access to accurate, authoritative 
information about the virus. Facebook 
added a COVID–19 Information Center 
to the tops of users’ News Feeds and 
announced it would remove misin-
formation that could contribute to im-
minent physical harm. Twitter verified 
accounts that provided credible up-
dates on the pandemic and committed 
to removing false or misleading con-
tent 
that 
contradicted 
information 
from 
health 
authorities. 
YouTube 
began directing users who searched for 
COVID-related information to the WHO 
or other health authorities and banned 
false information contradicting health 
authorities on treatment, prevention, 
diagnosis, or transmission of COVID– 
19. 
Unfortunately, these measure proved 
lacking and insufficient. The con-
spiracy film Plandemic was viewed 
more than 8 million times across social 
media platforms, and the sequel was 
viewed over 100,000 times on YouTube 
during its first week alone. An August 
2020 study by advocacy group Avaaz 
found that misinformation about vac-
cines and other health topics had been 
viewed an estimated 3.8 billion times 
on Facebook in the previous year—four 
times more than factual, authoritative 
content from institutions like the WHO 
and CDC. The study found that only 
16% of previously fact-checked health 
misinformation on Facebook carried a 
warning label. 
Spend even a small amount of time 
on the internet or social media and you 
will find rampant misinformation and 
conspiracy theories about COVID–19. 
Some examples of these falsehoods in-
clude: Bill Gates created the virus to 
use a vaccine as cover to implant 
microchips into Americans. No, actu-
ally, Dr. Fauci created the coronavirus 
to seize political power. You shouldn’t 
wear a mask to protect against the 
coronavirus, because wearing a mask 
actually weakens your immune sys-
tem. And do not worry if you catch the 
coronavirus—you can treat it by drink-
ing bleach. 
These claims might seem ridiculous, 
but they have real word consequences. 
A study published in the American 
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hy-
giene found that 5,800 people had been 
hospitalized and at least 800 people died 
in the first three months of 2020 alone 
as a direct result of coronavirus-re-
lated misinformation. As recently as 
August, the Georgia Department of 
Health and the Texas Poison Control 
Center had to warn people not to drink 
bleach to treat COVID. A recent poll 
found that only 51 percent of people 
wear a facial covering in public, de-
spite its proven efficacy in preventing 
the spread of COVID. And, perhaps 
must troubling, polls suggest that over 
30% of the U.S. population will not get 
a COVID vaccine. 
If 
we 
hope 
to 
get 
past 
the 
coronavirus and avoid similar public 
health crises in the future, we must un-
derstand where misinformation origi-
nates, how it spreads, and strategies to 
stop it. 
This is exactly what the COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act will do. It directs the National 
Science Foundation to partner with 
the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a 
study on the spread of COVID–19-re-
lated disinformation and misinforma-
tion on the internet and social media 
platforms. This study will provide crit-
ical 
information 
on 
the 
roles 
disinformation 
and 
misinformation 
have played in the public response to 
COVID–19, including public acceptance 
of and demand for COVID–19 vaccines; 
the 
sources 
of 
COVID–19-related 
disinformation and misinformation and 
the ways it has influenced the public 
debate; the role social media plays in 
the disseminating and promoting this 
disinformation 
and 
misinformation; 
and potential strategies for combatting 
misinformation and disinformation in 
the future. 
This information will not stop the 
next pandemic from coming. And, it 
will not force the next Administration 
to take it seriously and follow the ad-
vice of doctors and scientists. But it 
can give us the knowledge and tools 
necessary to avoid another infodemic 
and ensure the American public re-
ceives accurate and authoritative in-
formation when it is most needed. 
I therefore encourage my colleagues 
to 
support 
the 
COVID–19 
Disinformation Research and Report-
ing Act. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 933. A bill to designate the Battle-
ship IOWA Museum, located in Los An-
geles, California, as the National Mu-
seum of the Surface Navy, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Battleship 
Iowa National Museum of the Surface 
Navy Act,’’ which I introduced today. 
This simple bill would designate the 
Battleship USS Iowa Museum located 
in Los Angeles, California, as the ‘‘Na-
tional Museum of the Surface Navy.’’ 
The Battleship, USS Iowa Museum, 
would be the official museum to honor 
the millions of Americans who have 
proudly served and continue to serve in 
the United States Surface Navy since 
the founding of the Navy on October 13, 
1775. 
The Battleship USS Iowa is an iconic 
ship that served as a home to hundreds 
of thousands of sailors from all 50 
states. Commissioned in 1943, the Bat-
tleship Iowa has received accolades as 
the ‘‘World’s Greatest Navy Ship’’ and 
had several namesakes, including the 
‘‘Mighty I’’ and the ‘‘Big Stick,’’ which 
referred to President Teddy Roosevelt’s 
famous adage: ‘‘Speak softly and carry 
a big stick.’’ 
The USS Iowa was also known as the 
‘‘Battleship of Presidents.’’ In 1943, 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt used 
the ship for meetings with British 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill and 
Soviet Primer Joseph Stalin. President 
George H.W. Bush re-commissioned the 
USS Iowa in 1984 while serving as Vice 
President of the United States. Prior 
to the USS Iowa’s decommissioning in 
1990, President Ronald Reagan used the 
ship for our nation’s Celebration of 
Liberty in New York City on July 4, 
1986. 
The USS Iowa earned nine battle 
stars for service in World War II and 
two for service during the Korean War. 
The ship was also awarded the Navy 
Meritorious Unit Commendation, the 
Navy Occupation Service Medal, the 
Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, 
and the Navy ‘‘E’’ Ribbon—four times. 
In 2012, the Navy donated the Battle-
ship Iowa to the Pacific Battleship 
Center, which established the Battle-
ship USS Iowa Museum at the Port of 
Los Angeles. Since its opening, the Mu-
seum has welcomed millions of visi-
tors. 
The Museum also hosts numerous 
military activities, including enlist-
ments, 
re-enlistments, 
commissionings, promotions, and com-
munity service days. The museum also 
provides on-site training for federal, 
state, and local law enforcement per-
sonnel. 
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 
museum has closed all of its indoor ex-
hibits and has struggled to attract visi-
tors. As a non-profit organization, the 
museum is supported solely by admis-
sions, donations, event space rentals, 
and gift shops. 
HOW THE BILL WOULD HELP 
Our bill would designate the USS 
Battleship Iowa Museum as the ‘‘Na-
tional Museum of the Surface Navy’’ to 
raise awareness and educate the public 
on the important role of the United 
States Surface Navy. 
The ‘‘National Museum of the Sur-
face Navy’’ would build on the success 
of the Battleship USS Iowa Museum by 
introducing new exhibits and programs 
with a focus on education, veterans, 
and community. 
CONCLUSION 
It is imperative that we preserve the 
legacy of those who have served on the 
Battleship USS Iowa and all Surface 
Navy ships. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President. I yield the floor.

CASSIDY, Mr. GRASSLEY, Ms.

ceptive act or practice prescribed under sec-
tion 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)). 
(2) POWERS OF THE COMMISSION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall en-
force this Act in the same manner, by the 
same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
powers, and duties as though all applicable 
terms and provisions of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were

COM-
MITTED IN THE XUAR 
Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. RUBIO, 
Mr. MARKEY, Mr. HAGERTY, Mr. KAINE, 
and Mr. ROMNEY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 131 
Whereas the Uyghurs are one of several 
predominantly Muslim Turkic groups living 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
(XUAR) in the northwest of the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC); 
Whereas, following Uyghur demonstrations 
and unrest in 2009 and clashes with govern-
ment security personnel and other violent 
incidents in subsequent years, PRC leaders 
sought to ‘‘stabilize’’ the XUAR through 
large-scale arrests and extreme security 
measures aimed at combatting alleged ter-
rorism, religious extremism, and ethnic sep-
aratism; 
Whereas, in May 2014, the PRC launched its 
‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extremism’’ 
campaign, which placed further restrictions 
on and facilitated additional human rights 
violations against minorities in the XUAR 
under the pretext of fighting terrorism; 
Whereas, in August 2016, Chinese Com-
munist Party (CCP) Politburo member Chen 
Quanguo, former Tibet Autonomous Region 
(TAR) Party Secretary, known for over-
seeing intensifying security operations and 
human rights abuses in the TAR, was ap-
pointed as Party Secretary of the XUAR; 
Whereas, beginning in 2017, XUAR authori-
ties have sought to forcibly ‘‘assimilate’’ 
Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities into 
Chinese society through a policy of cultural 
erasure known as ‘‘Sinicization’’; 
Whereas, since 2018, credible reporting in-
cluding from the BBC, France24, and the New 
York Times has shown that the Government 
of the PRC has built mass internment camps 
in the XUAR, which it calls ‘‘vocational 
training’’ centers, and detained Uyghurs and 
other groups in them and other facilities; 
Whereas, since 2015, XUAR authorities 
have 
arbitrarily 
detained 
an 
estimated 
1,500,000 Uyghurs—12.5 percent of the XUAR’s 
official Uyghur population of 12,000,000—and 
a smaller number of other ethnic minorities 
in the ‘‘vocational training’’ centers and 
other detention and pre-detention facilities; 
Whereas, in 2017, the XUAR accounted for 
less than two percent of the PRC’s total pop-
ulation but 21 percent of all arrests in China; 
Whereas The Atlantic, Radio Free Asia, 
and other sources have revealed that detain-
ees are forced to renounce many of their Is-
lamic beliefs and customs and repudiate 
Uyghur culture, language, and identity; 
Whereas investigations by Human Rights 
Watch and other human rights organizations 
have documented how detainees are subject 
to political indoctrination, forced labor, 
crowded and unsanitary conditions, involun-
tary biometric data collection, both medical 
neglect and intrusive medical interventions, 
food and water deprivation, beatings, sexual 
violence, and torture; 
Whereas research by the Australian Stra-
tegic Policy Institute suggests that, since 
late 2019, many detainees have been placed in

higher security facilities and convicted of 
formal crimes; 
Whereas Human Rights Watch has reported 
that the PRC uses data collection programs, 
including facial recognition technology, to 
surveil Uyghurs in the XUAR and to identify 
individuals whom authorities may detain; 
Whereas PRC authorities have placed 
countless children whose parents are de-
tained or in exile in state-run institutions 
and boarding schools without the consent of 
their parents; 
Whereas New York Times reporting re-
vealed that numerous local PRC officials 
who did not agree with the policies carried 
out in XUAR have been fired and imprisoned; 
Whereas Associated Press reporting docu-
mented widespread and systemic efforts by 
PRC authorities to force Uyghur women to 
take contraceptives or to subject them to 
sterilization or abortion, threatening to de-
tain those who do not comply; 
Whereas PRC authorities prohibit family 
members and advocates inside and outside 
China from having regular communications 
with relatives and friends imprisoned in the 
XUAR, such as journalist and entrepreneur 
Ekpar Asat; 
Whereas PRC authorities have imposed 
pervasive restrictions on the peaceful prac-
tice of Islam in the XUAR, to the extent that 
Human Rights Watch asserts the PRC ‘‘has 
effectively outlawed the practice of Islam’’; 
Whereas individuals who are not detained 
in camps have been forced to attend political 
indoctrination sessions, subjected to move-
ment restrictions, mass surveillance sys-
tems, involuntary biometric data collection, 
and other human rights abuses; 
Whereas international media, nongovern-
mental organizations, scholars, families, and 
survivors have reported on the systemic na-
ture of many of these abuses; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2020, a group of 50 
independent United Nations experts jointly 
expressed alarm over China’s deteriorating 
human rights record, including its repression 
in Xinjiang, and called on the international 
community ‘‘to act collectively and deci-
sively to ensure China respects human rights 
and abides by its international obligations’’; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2020, 39 United Na-
tions member countries issued a public 
statement condemning human rights viola-
tions by PRC authorities and calling on the 
PRC to allow the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Human Rights unfettered ac-
cess to Xinjiang; 
Whereas the United States Congress passed 
the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 
(Public Law 116–145); 
Whereas the United States Congress passed 
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Ac-
countability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note), 
which has been used to sanction PRC offi-
cials and entities for their activities in the 
XUAR; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has implemented additional targeted restric-
tions on trade with Xinjiang and imposed 
visa and economic sanctions on PRC officials 
and entities for their activities in the XUAR; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has documented human rights abuses and 
violations of individual freedoms in the 
XUAR, including in the 2019 Department of 
State Report on International Religious 
Freedom; 
Whereas, on August 25, 2020, the Biden for 
President campaign stated, ‘‘The unspeak-
able oppression that Uighurs and other eth-
nic minorities have suffered at the hands of 
China’s authoritarian government is geno-
cide and Joe Biden stands against it in the 
strongest terms.’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, former Sec-
retary of State Michael Pompeo ‘‘determined 
that the PRC, under the direction and con-
trol of the CCP, has committed genocide 
against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs 
and other ethnic and religious minority 
groups in Xinjiang’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, during his 
confirmation hearing, Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken testified that ‘‘forcing men, 
women, and children into concentration 
camps, trying to in effect reeducate them to 
be adherents to the Chinese Communist 
Party – all of that speaks to an effort to 
commit genocide’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, Secretary of 
the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, during her 
confirmation hearing, publicly stated that 
China is guilty of ‘‘horrendous human rights 
abuses’’; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, in response 
to a question from the press regarding the 
Uyghurs, Secretary Blinken stated that his 
‘‘judgement remains that genocide was com-
mitted against the Uyghurs’’; and 
Whereas, on March 10, 2021, in response to 
a question on Xinjiang during his testimony 
before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives, Secretary 
Blinken reiterated, ‘‘We’ve been clear, and 
I’ve been clear, that I see it as genocide, 
other egregious abuses of human rights, and 
we’ll continue to make that clear.’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the atrocities committed by 
the CCP against Uyghurs and other predomi-
nantly Muslim Turkic groups in Xinjiang, 
including forced labor, sexual violence, the 
internment of over 1,000,000 individuals, and 
other horrific abuses; 
(2) urges the President, the Secretary of 
State, and the United States Ambassador to 
the United Nations to speak publicly about 
the ongoing human rights abuses in the 
XUAR, including in formal speeches at the 
United Nations and other international fora; 
(3) urges the President, the Secretary of 
State, and the United States Ambassador to 
the United Nations to appeal to the United 
Nations Secretary-General to take a more 
proactive and public stance on the situation 
in the XUAR, including by supporting calls 
for an investigation and accountability for 
individuals and entities involved in abuses 
against the people of the XUAR; 
(4) supports continued targeted sanctions 
and the use of all diplomatic tools available 
to hold those responsible for the atrocities in 
Xinjiang to account; 
(5) urges United States agencies engaged 
with China on trade, climate, defense, or 
other bilateral issues to include human 
rights abuses in the XUAR as a consideration 
in developing United States policy; 
(6) supports Radio Free Asia Uyghur, the 
only Uyghur-language news service in the 
world independent of Chinese government in-
fluence; and 
(7) recognizes the repeated requests from 
the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights for unfettered access to the 
XUAR and the PRC’s refusal to comply, and 
therefore— 
(A) calls on PRC authorities to allow un-
fettered access by the United Nations Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to the XUAR; 
(B) urges collaborative action between the 
United States Government and international 
partners to pressure PRC authorities to 
allow unfettered access to the XUAR; 
(C) urges the President, the Secretary of 
State, and the United States Ambassador to 
the United Nations to simultaneously out-
line a strategy to investigate the human 
rights abuses and crimes that have taken 
place in the XUAR, collect evidence, and 
transfer the evidence to a competent court; 
and 
(D) urges United States partners and allies 
to undertake similar strategies in an effort 
to build an international investigation out-
side of the PRC if PRC authorities do not 
comply with a United Nations investigation 
in the XUAR.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 1868 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 1868, an act to prevent 
across-the-board direct spending cuts, 
which was received from the House and 
is at the desk. 
I further ask that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the 
Democrats have just passed a $1.9 tril-
lion spending package. They filled the 
bill with lots of partisan priorities. 
They refused to work with Members on 
this side of the aisle. Almost all of 
what we are doing here—have done 
there is going on a credit card. That is 
going to have to be paid for by our chil-
dren and their children. 
Democrats also ignored the Medicare 
sequester as part of that $1.9 trillion 
bill. As a doctor, I have cared for pa-
tients in Wyoming for more than two 
decades. I cannot ignore this decision. 
There are more cuts to healthcare 
providers serving seniors. That is what 
these have done. They go into effect 
starting April 1. They are coming. 
Congress must help those working on 
the frontlines fighting the COVID–19 
pandemic. It should be our highest pri-
ority. Ignoring cuts to Medicare while 
spending $1.9 trillion on other things, 
to me, is irresponsible. 
Instead, just a few days after their 
partisan spending bill was signed into 
law, here we have the chairman of the 
Budget Committee back asking for ad-
ditional money. 
Now, he knows the right thing to do 
is to help these Medicare providers on 
the frontlines, and I want to do exactly 
the same thing. Once again, instead of 
working on a bipartisan basis, Senate 
Democrats are rushing through an-
other partisan spending package. 
There is a better way. Senator COT-
TON and I have introduced the Pro-
tecting Seniors Access to Healthcare 
Act. Our legislation takes a small 
amount of the money from State and 
local governments as part of that $1.9 
trillion bill. Instead of billions going to 
Gavin Newsom and instead of billions 
going to Andrew Cuomo, our legisla-
tion gives a small fraction of that 
money to help our healthcare providers 
around the country. Instead of a blank 
check, our bill gets the money to where 
it is needed the most: to healthcare 
providers on the frontlines of this pan-
demic. 
Our bill also includes commonsense 
provisions to ensure that taxpayer 
money is not given to illegal immi-
grants or prisoners. Our bill simply 
says that if you are here illegally, you 
don’t get the payments in the Demo-
cratic spending bill. 
Senator COTTON and I know we can’t 
hand out American taxpayer dollars to 
illegal immigrants. That is why our 
border is being flooded right now—be-
cause President Biden offers benefits 
for 
illegal 
immigrants. 
We 
also 
shouldn’t be cutting checks to people 
sitting in jail. 
The question is whether Washington 
Democrats are interested in solving 
problems or just playing politics. I 
think we can provide much needed re-
lief for Medicare providers, and we 
should. It is completely irresponsible 
for the Democrats and the administra-
tion to spend $1.9 trillion and fail to 
help the healthcare providers who are 
working to serve Medicare patients. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask that 
the Senator modify his request to in-
stead take up H.R. 1868 with my sub-
stitute amendment at the desk and ask 
unanimous consent that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Vermont so modify his 
request? 
Mr. SANDERS. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request by the Senator from Vermont? 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I under-
stand we are not in a quorum call. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct. 
f 
DEFENSE BUDGET 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am 
down here today to talk about some-
thing that I have talked about many 
times before, and that is the need to 
have a strong defense budget so we can 
deter our adversaries. 
You know, it is not like it used to be 
in the old days. It is for real. These 
guys—China, for example, is in a posi-
tion they have never been in before. I 
think it is important that we talk 
about this budget that is coming up 
again. It is more important now than 
ever. 
Over the past few weeks, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee has been 
having hearings in which we have 
heard from top military leaders, de-
fense experts, and Pentagon officials. 
What we have heard has been grim. 
LTG H.R. McMaster told us that 
since the 1990s, China has undertaken 
the ‘‘largest peacetime military build-
up in history.’’ 
Admiral Davidson, who leads the U.S. 
Indo-Pacific Command said, ‘‘I think 
our conventional deterrent is actually 
eroding in the region.’’ 
Last week, Admiral Faller, who leads 
the U.S. Southern Command, said, 
‘‘Now more than ever, I feel a sense of 
urgency about global threats we face in 
our neighborhood.’’ 
Now, I agree. I thought the Cold War 
was bad, but the threats we are facing 
now, especially from China, are more 
complex and more dangerous than they 
ever have been before. In fact, I look 
back sometimes wistfully at the days 
of the Cold War when things were pre-
dictable. We had two superpowers. We 
knew what they had; they knew what 
we had. Mutual assured destruction 
meant something. It really doesn’t 
anymore. Times have changed. I agree 
that the Cold War was bad, but it is 
worse today. 
I am glad to hear President Biden 
and members of his administration say 
that China is our top pacing threat. 
Both Secretary Austin and Deputy Sec-
retary Hicks told the Armed Services 
Committee during their nomination 
hearings that was the situation. 
What concerns me is, I haven’t seen 
the Biden administration take any ac-
tion that backs up these words. In-
stead, we are hearing rumors that the 
Biden administration is considering a 
flat defense budget, which is actually a 
2-percent cut when you adjust for infla-
tion. At the same time, China is in-
creasing theirs by 6.8 percent. 
It kind of reminds me of the last 5 
years of the Obama-Biden administra-
tion. That would have been from 2010 
to 2015. During that 5-year period, the 
budget for the military was reduced by 
25 percent. At the same time that it

was reduced by 25 percent, China was

was happening out in the real world. 
People are not aware of this. 
This sort of thing tells me that the

isn’t 
serious

pushing back on China. And do you 
know what? It also tells China the 
same thing. So talk is cheap, but de-
fending our country is not. 
If we really want to send the right 
signal to Beijing—a signal that says 
you can’t ever win against us—we need 
sustained investment in our defense. 
We have seen what happens when we 
cut defense spending before. Look no 
further than the Obama administra-
tion’s 25 percent cut over 5 years. If we 
had just increased defense spending 
with the rate of inflation over the past 
decade, we could have invested another 
$400 billion in modernizing our mili-
tary—money 
we 
wouldn’t 
have 
to 
spend today. Instead, we are playing 
catchup with China, which added at 
least $200 billion that we know of—we 
never know for sure with China—to its 
defense budget over the same time pe-
riod. Chinese military modernization 
has been nothing short of astonishing. 
Their ability to move fast and increase 
production rates is leaving us back in 
the dust. 
We have invested heavily in the ad-
vanced capabilities we know we need, 
like 
hypersonic 
weapons, 
bio-
technology, and quantum computing. 
We are already spreading our mili-
tary too thin. Our servicemembers 
have been asked to do too much with 
too little for too long. 
But we know how we can put our 
military on a better track. We have a 
blueprint—the 2018 National Defense 
Strategy. This strategy actually has 
been very effective. It was put together 
back in 2018 by six Democrats and six 
Republicans, and they all had expertise 
in the area, where it has not been ques-
tioned. So we actually have a docu-
ment here that shows us what we can 
do. 
If we had increased—the Chinese 
military modernization has been noth-
ing short of astounding. Their ability 
to move fast and increase production 
rates is leaving us in the dust. 
Here we have something that we can 
follow, and it has been successful so 
far. We have all agreed that this is 
what we should be doing, but we have 
not been doing it successfully. We 
know the strategy is right when it 
comes to priorities and the long-term 
nature of this competition. Secretary 
Austin and Secretary Hicks said as 
much in our committee hearings. 
So why are they talking about add-
ing more missions, including the De-
partment’s role in climate change and 
pandemic response and not countering 
China? 
So we know what the strategy needs 
to be, and that tells us what the de-
mands on our force look like. Those de-
mands keep growing. Now we need to 
mesh the budget with the strategy. We 
know what it looks like, and that is at 
least a 3- to 5-percent real growth 
above inflation. 
Now, that is what was determined 
some time ago, in 2018, and that is 
what we really need to be doing, but we 
are not doing it. And yet we know what 
should be done. 
So, you know, this is a new adminis-
tration, and I am going to do all I can. 
I have already met with the President, 
with the administration. I know that 
they are concerned, but we are going to 
have to get down and actually get it 
done. It means, in real dollars, an in-
crease of at least $75 to $125 billion 
each year. Now, that would be if we 
stuck with the 3- to 5-percent increase 
that is predicted as being necessary in 
this book. This kind of investment for 
5 years in a row would completely close 
the difference between U.S. and Chi-
nese defense spending. 
And what does the investment get 
us? It allows us to keep our commit-
ment to our servicemembers to not 
only take care of them and their fami-
lies but also to give them the tools and 
training to do their jobs. 
You know, often, we hear about the 
fact that we are spending too much on 
the military. We talk about that we 
spend more on the military than both 
China and Russia put together. But 
there is a reason for that. The most ex-
pensive line that we have in our mili-
tary is taking care of the troops, their 
families. You know, in the communist 
countries, they don’t have to do that. 
They give them the guns; they go out 
and kill people. They don’t have to 
spend the money that we do. But we do 
it, and we do it right. But we need to 
continue to increase so we can get dug 
out of the hole that we have dug over 
decades of insufficient funding and 
overuse of the force. The bills have 
been piling up for years. This is a down 
payment to get the U.S. military 
healthy for decades of strategic com-
petition. 
Now, I am hesitant to even entertain 
this idea, but I think it is important to 
talk about it. I know that there are 
some out there who would like to see 
the President go even further and cut 
defense spending by 10 percent. This is 
wrong, and Congress has already flat 
rejected it on a bipartisan basis last 
year. In the Senate it was defeated by 
77 to 23. Even in the Democrat-led 
House, it was defeated on a 3-to-1 mar-
gin. 
Now, take it from the President’s 
own Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kath 
Hicks, who wrote that a 10-percent cut 
would turn the United States into a re-
gional power, increase nuclear pro-
liferation, and weaken our allies. This 
is completely opposite of everything 
President Biden says he wants to do. It 
would preemptively surrender the 21st 
century to the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
A strong defense budget is the first 
step. It underpins all of our efforts 
when it comes to diplomacy, the econ-
omy, and technology. 
Is China going to slow its military 
investments any time soon? No, it is 
not. In fact, we know their actual level 
of spending is a lot larger than it 
looks. Economics, yes, but the Chinese 
Communist Party also lies about its 
military budget—no surprise. We know 
that they lied about COVID–19, and 
they continue to lie about their human 
rights atrocities against the Uighurs. 
So if we don’t properly resource our 
military and put our right forces in the 
right place at the right time with the 
right staff, we are going to fall further 
behind. 
So it is kind of early right now, and 
this is the time, though, that we need 
to be talking about it immediately to 
be preparing for the future. 
The bipartisan 2018 NDS Commission 
report already said the U.S. military 
could very well lose the next state-on- 
state war it fights. 
We need the Biden administration to 
lead here—to walk the walk and not 
just talk the talk when it comes to 
China. And if the Biden team won’t 
lead, I will make sure that we use our 
role in Congress to send the message. 
It is not just Beijing that needs to 
see that we are serious, but our allies 
and our partners need to see this as 
well. 
The best signal we can send is a 
strong defense budget topline. This 
can’t simply wait any longer. This is 
common sense, and this is something, I 
think, that we will, on a bipartisan 
basis, recognize that we need to do and 
prepare for immediately. That is what 
we intend to do, and that is what is ex-
pected of us at this time. 
With that, I will yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
NOMINATION OF MARTIN JOSEPH 
WALSH 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
not often I come down to the floor to 
say I have a lot in common with the 
Senate majority leader, Senator SCHU-
MER from New York. In fact, in my 6 
years in the Senate, I don’t think I 
have ever done that. 
But after reading his remarks prior 
to the vote that we took yesterday on 
the Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh, I 
thought I would come down and make 
a few points on that nominee, that 
vote, and some issues I have in com-
mon with the majority leader and now- 
Secretary 
Walsh 
and 
maybe 
some 
issues I don’t have so much in common 
with the majority leader but I think I 
do have with Secretary Walsh, which is 
why I voted for him. 
First, as I mentioned, I, too, sup-
ported our now-Secretary of Labor, 
Marty Walsh, for some of the reasons 
that Senator SCHUMER did. Let me ex-
plain. Secretary Walsh started in the 
Laborers’ Union, Local 223, in Boston, 
age 21, following in his father’s foot-
steps. Now, as many people know, the 
Laborers are the biggest building con-
struction union in the country. They 
build things—pipelines, roads, oil wells, 
bridges. They have made America 
strong. I am a big fan of Laborers and 
leaders like Joey Merritt back home 
and Terry O’Sullivan, whom I am going 
to talk a little bit about. 
Secretary Walsh followed his father’s 
example and joined the Laborers in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1718 
March 23, 2021 
Boston. He is also the son of Irish im-
migrants, which is something that is 
near and dear to my heart. And Sen-
ator SCHUMER said he has something 
very 
much 
in 
common—yesterday, 
when 
he 
spoke 
about 
Secretary 
Walsh—with Secretary Walsh because 
his grandfather was an immigrant from 
Eastern Europe who also, when he 
came over to America, got very in-
volved with the labor movement. That 
is really a very common, powerful 
story of the American dream, common 
to millions—Senator SCHUMER’s fam-
ily, Secretary Walsh’s family, and it is 
certainly a story that I have in com-
mon with those two. 
You see, my great-grandfather was 
from a family of Irish immigrants, and 
he was also very involved in the labor 
movement. In fact, he was one of the 
original 
cofounders 
of 
the 
Inter-
national 
Brotherhood 
of 
Electrical 
Workers, the IBEW. He was its first 
grand marshal. 
I have something I am quite proud of 
here. It is a page from the history 
books of the IBEW, talking about my 
great-grandfather’s great work for the 
IBEW when it first got off the ground. 
I look forward to working with Sec-
retary Walsh on helping the men and 
women in America, certainly in my 
State, who build things. They have suc-
ceeded. They rise up and help others 
rise 
up—other 
working 
men 
and 
women—the way Secretary Walsh’s fa-
ther did, the way Senator SCHUMER’s 
grandfather did, the way my great- 
grandfather did. It is a great American 
story. 
But I must say that my views and 
Senator SCHUMER’s diverge on some of 
the other things he may have been 
speaking about when he talked about 
Secretary Walsh’s nomination yester-
day. 
One, he was critical of some of the 
Trump administration’s Department of 
Labor policies as related to the men 
and women who build things—these 
working men and women—despite the 
fact that prior to the pandemic, with 
some of the policies that we imple-
mented here, the United States had the 
strongest economy in decades, the low-
est unemployment rate in 50 years, 
wages were finally going up after 2 dec-
ades of stagnation. And very impor-
tantly for the working men and women 
of this country, there was a huge ex-
pansion and boom in the American en-
ergy sector, ‘‘all of the above’’ energy: 
oil, gas, renewables, as important to 
the Presiding Officer as it is to Alaska. 
Let me describe one other narrative 
that I believe certainly is true that I 
have seen in my professional life in 
Alaska—in America but certainly back 
home in my State—and that is the nar-
rative that I am not so sure my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
want to highlight. But I am going to 
highlight it because I think it is really 
important, particularly now, and it is 
this: When national Democrats, wheth-
er during the Obama administration or 
now, during the Biden administration, 
are set up with the choice where they 
have to choose between the interests of 
the working men and women in this 
country who build things versus the in-
terests of the extremists—radical envi-
ronmental groups who want to kill jobs 
and shut them down—they almost al-
ways side with these groups who kill 
jobs, not the working men and women 
of America, not the working men and 
women of Alaska. 
This is true. My colleagues some-
times don’t want to admit it, but it is 
true. Do you know who else has seen it, 
and do you know who else I believe 
knows it is true? Secretary Walsh as a 
laborer. He has seen it. That is another 
reason why I voted for him. 
He and his fellow laborers, whether 
in Boston or Alaska, also know that 
this issue is true. When there is a 
choice between the working men and 
women of America who build things 
versus the extremists who want to shut 
things down, way too often, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle go 
with the extremists, not the men and 
women who build things in this coun-
try. 
Now, this narrative is not only con-
tinuing under the Biden administra-
tion; it is accelerating, and it has been 
bad for Alaska, bad for America, bad 
for working families, and, to be honest, 
it is a bit surprising. President Biden 
came into office talking about his blue 
collar roots, but right now, the record 
is anything but supporting the men 
and women who build things. 
Here is a snapshot of what is going on 
in my State. In the first 4 weeks of the 
Biden administration, there were eight 
Executive orders focused on Alaska— 
eight. No other State has had that 
many Executive orders focused on 
Alaskan working families. 
Day one, ANWR—trying to shut that 
down. We got that done in this body. 
They also killed the Keystone Pipe-
line—10,000 jobs, laborers’ jobs. Marty 
Walsh knows a lot about that. It goes 
on and on and on. There are Executive 
orders right now that, from my State’s 
perspective, are focused on hurting 
working men and women. 
There is another one I will talk 
about. It is a project we have, a big en-
ergy project in Alaska called the Wil-
low project. This has been permitted by 
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations for 25 years to finally get it 
going—the Clinton administration, the 
Obama administration, the Trump ad-
ministration, everybody. It is in the 
National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, 
a place set aside by Congress over 70 
years ago for oil and gas development 
and good jobs. It is not controversial at 
all. The Biden administration has put a 
hold on that. Here is the estimate. It is 
a $7 billion project that will produce 
American energy and an estimated 
2,000 direct jobs on the Willow project. 
This isn’t some pie-in-the-sky project 
that we were starting this winter. 
There were 2,000 direct jobs, 75 percent 
of which are union jobs, and they are 
saying ‘‘We are going to put a hold on 
it’’—thousands 
of 
additional 
sup-
porting jobs, and they are going to put 
a hold on that. Why? Well, we know 
why, because in the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, some of the most ex-
treme radical environmental groups in 
the country sued to stop it, and they 
were successful. 
So guess what happened in Alaska 
this winter during a recession. The 
2,000 men and women who were work-
ing on this project were given pink 
slips and told to go home. That is what 
happened. 
Mr. President, don’t just take my 
word for it. I want to quote again from 
Terry O’Sullivan. He is the head of the 
Laborers, 
the 
biggest 
construction 
union in the country. This was his re-
action after day one of the Biden ad-
ministration, where there was a choice 
of working men and women who build 
things like pipelines or the radical ex-
tremist 
environmental 
groups 
who 
want to shut down and kill American 
jobs. It is a choice—day one, the rad-
ical environmentalists win. 
Here is what the head of the Labor-
ers—remember, 
Marty 
Walsh, 
Sec-
retary Walsh is a Laborer from Boston. 
Here is what the head of the Laborers, 
the great American Terry O’Sullivan, 
said: 
The Biden administration’s decision to 
cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit on 
day one of his presidency is both insulting 
and disappointing to the thousands of hard- 
working LIUNA members— 
Those are the Laborers. 
—who will lose good-paying, middle class 
family-supporting jobs. 
By blocking this 100 percent union project, 
and pandering to environmental extremists— 
Remember, this is Terry O’Sullivan 
talking, not Senator SULLIVAN talking. 
—a thousand union jobs will immediately 
vanish and 10,000 additional jobs will be fore-
gone. 
That is Terry O’Sullivan. Remember 
the choice: Men and women who build 
things and make our country great 
versus extremist groups like the Center 
for Biological Diversity—they go with 
the extremists. 
Here is Mark McManus, general 
president of the United Association of 
Union Plumbers and Pipefitters. They 
were going to build the Keystone Pipe-
line, too, just like LIUNA members: 
In revoking this permit, the Biden Admin-
istration has chosen to listen to the voices of 
fringe activists instead of union members 
and the American consumer on Day 1 [of the 
Biden administration]. Let me be . . . clear. 
This is Mark McManus still talking. 
When built with union labor by the men 
and women of the United Association, pipe-
lines like Keystone XL remain the safest and 
most efficient modes of energy transpor-
tation in the world. Sadly, the Biden Admin-
istration has now put thousands of union 
members and workers out of work. 
This is why the Secretary of Labor 
we just confirmed—and I was glad to 
support him because he is a Laborer. 
He knows how to build things. He 
knows these politics. This is why it is 
important to have his voice because

the voice of the extremist is much 
stronger in this administration. It is 
not just policies of killing union jobs— 
the men and women who build things 
for America—but if you listen, it is 
how the new members of this adminis-
tration talk about these jobs. Listen. 
You have to listen, and what you hear 
is a condescending tone as it relates to 
these jobs. You may have heard John 
Kerry and Gina McCarthy, the climate 
change czars in the White House, who 
were saying in one of their press con-
ferences that we need to help people 
make ‘‘better choices’’ on their jobs. 
That is pretty condescending. They are 
talking about laborers. They are talk-
ing about my oil and gas workers in 
the great State of Alaska or in Colo-
rado. 
The Secretary of Energy, in her con-
firmation hearing, talked about how 
some of the jobs might have to be ‘‘sac-
rificed.’’ 
Even in the Environment and Public 
Works Committee—and I am a very bi-
partisan guy—some of my Senate col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
were recently talking about: We need 
to encourage people to get more ‘‘rel-
evant jobs.’’ 
What is more relevant than powering 
America? 
Until recently, the men and women 
who built America—pipelines, oil and 
gas rigs, roads, bridges, the men and 
women with dirt under their finger-
nails—were celebrated, which is as 
they should be. They built this coun-
try. They powered this country. They 
won wars for this country. By the way, 
they often fought in wars for this coun-
try. Then they came home. They got 
good jobs in the building trades as la-
borers, operating engineers, pipefitters, 
teamsters, IBEWs—the IBEW like my 
great-grandfather helped start. Not so 
much anymore. 
The new Secretary of Energy is now 
calling them ‘‘fossil workers’’ who are 
from ‘‘fossil communities.’’ I am not 
kidding. Listen to her. I have been try-
ing to give them a little bit of advice: 
Don’t use that term. It is conde-
scending. You are talking to workers 
as if they are some kind of dinosaur 
that should be put in a museum. Com-
munities? Fossil communities? Really? 
Madam Secretary, if you are listen-
ing, ditch that language. It drips with 
an attitude of being condescending to-
ward these great Americans. 
Well, I was just home in my State 
with a bunch of these so-called ‘‘fossil 
workers’’ this past weekend. These are 
some of the best, most patriotic Ameri-
cans anywhere. They are tough; they 
are hard-working; they love their coun-
try, but I will tell you they are con-
cerned. They are concerned. Why? Be-
cause they know that exactly what I 
have been talking about here is hap-
pening—the radical, extremist environ-
mental groups want to kill and are 
killing jobs. 
By the way, as for that lawsuit I 
talked about on the Willow Project, 200 
Alaskans were sent home during a re-
cession. Men and women who have to 
pay mortgages and pay tuitions were 
sent home. 
So my workers in the great State of 
Alaska are concerned. They know that 
these groups they are sending have a 
beeline into the White House and that 
they want to kill jobs—energy jobs—in 
my State and in America. They are 
worried that the majority now, the 
Senate majority, has similar views, so 
they are nervous. 
Yet I am hopeful on one thing. Given 
his background and his heritage—now I 
am talking about the Secretary of 
Labor, Secretary Walsh. 
I believe that, when the decisions are 
made—and I hope when the decisions 
are being made in the Biden adminis-
tration to kill more good-paying en-
ergy jobs that built this country—and 
when they are coming before the Biden 
administration, the new Secretary of 
Labor is going to stand up for the 
working men and women, stand up for 
the laborers in Boston whom he knows 
so well or the laborers in Alaska whom 
he knows so well and look at the other 
Cabinet members and say: Not on my 
watch. We are not going to kill any 
more of these jobs. 
That is what I am hopeful for. That 
is what he committed to me to do, and 
that is why I voted for Secretary Walsh 
as the new Secretary of Labor. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
have one more topic I would like to 
talk about today. It is another impor-
tant one, and it is one that many have 
been talking about here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. Many have spoken 
very eloquently about this topic, and 
depending on when they have spoken 
about it—this year, this week, last 
year, a decade ago, a century ago—it is 
a topic that is really fundamental to 
this institution, and it looks as if 
Members in this institution are trying 
to change the institution forever. Now, 
I am talking about the filibuster. 
As you know, there has been much 
talk recently about the possibility of 
getting rid of the filibuster. This is an 
action that will fundamentally trans-
form this institution, certainly, but I 
believe, frankly, it will transform our 
country. I don’t think this is a wise 
move at all. The irony is—and I am 
going to talk about it—until very re-
cently, the vast majority of my col-
leagues, Republican and Democratic, 
were in agreement on this topic in that 
getting rid of the legislative filibuster 
was not a wise move for the Senate and 
not a wise move for America. 
Now, this might seem like an insular 
issue—something that people in Wash-
ington, DC, get incensed about, wound 
up about, and the people back home 
might not necessarily care because it 
might not impact them—but I don’t 
think that this is the case at all. This 
rule, the filibuster, is at the very heart 
of what keeps extreme legislation, 
pushed by a small minority of the pub-
lic, from passing. It is a rule that, in 
the Senate, certainly encourages, if not 
demands, compromise and bipartisan 
work both when one’s party is in or out 
of power. 
Now, look, our instincts as Sen-
ators—all of our instincts—are to get 
things done for our States, for our 
country, but what is good for Alaska 
isn’t always good for Colorado, and 
what is good for Colorado isn’t always 
good for New York. What is good for 
the majority isn’t always good for the 
minority and vice versa and isn’t al-
ways good for the Nation. That is the 
heart of federalism. It is also why the 
majority can’t wield unfettered power 
in the U.S. Senate. With the exception 
of a few laws, what is required here is 
typically 60 votes on legislation. It is 
what separates this body, the Senate, 
from the House. 
For the good of the country, if you 
look at our history, we must work to-
gether, find compromise, find con-
sensus, find solutions, particularly on 
major legislation, to get a broad-based 
buy-in from all Americans or most 
Americans. This is what the filibuster 
has required. 
Remember, the Framers understood 
that, here in the Senate, we would be 
different from the House. We would be 
the bulwark against what James Madi-
son called an anchor, a necessary fence, 
against the fickleness and passions 
that pervade the House. No offense to 
our Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives, but as George Washington 
is said to have told Thomas Jefferson, 
the Framers created the Senate to cool 
House legislation. It was the cooling 
saucer you had with regard to the tea 
in the cup. 
Indeed, the Senate—often referred to 
as the ‘‘world’s greatest deliberative 
body’’ in its earliest days—was founded 
on the right of unlimited debate. That 
is what the filibuster is. Even in the 
first session of the Senate in 1789, Sen-
ators used this right to debate and de-
bate and debate in order to delay con-
sideration of legislation. It wasn’t 
until the mid-1800s that this tactic was 
coined the ‘‘filibuster.’’ 
The point is that this procedural rule 
in the Senate has been here, in one 
form or another, since the founding of 
the Republic, and when you hear my 
colleagues talk about it as some new, 
recent procedure, it is just not factu-
ally accurate. Before the 1900s, there 
was no formal procedure to even end 
debate if a Senator chose to talk a bill 
to death. It wasn’t until 1917, during a 
debate about arming Merchant Marine 
vessels during World War I, that the 
Senate established the cloture tool, 
giving the body the ability to end de-
bate by a certain margin of Senators. 
Now, as some of my colleagues have 
been debating recently and have men-
tioned throughout its history, we have 
seen the filibuster, cloture used for 
good. We have used it to stop legisla-
tion, and it has also been used for ill— 
to delay much needed, historic reforms 
like civil rights legislation during the

fifties and sixties, legislation which 
was filibustered by Democratic Sen-
ators until the filibuster was finally 
broken in the sixties. It has also been 
used for many other purposes, but 
Members on both sides have used it for 
centuries. In fact, one scholar’s ac-
count was that the very first Senate 
filibuster was over a bridge across the 
Potomac River. I am not sure why, but 
I guess it was an important issue back 
then. 
So slowing things down, cooling pas-
sions, that is what this body was de-
signed to do, and that is what this pro-
cedure has done for decades. That is 
why my friends on the other side, who 
are undertaking a push to get rid of 
this, need to think. They need to stop. 
They need to think. The American peo-
ple 
need 
to 
understand 
the 
con-
sequences, and our good friends in the 
media who are covering the Senate 
need to write some real history about 
this. 
As my friends on the other side of the 
aisle know, this is one of these issues 
that, when the shoe was on the other 
foot, we did not take action. What am 
I talking about? Recently, the Repub-
licans held the majority in the Senate, 
and, recently, with President Trump, 
we had a Republican in the White 
House. There was frustration, and they 
wanted to move things quicker, and 
the President, President Trump, was 
pressuring many Senators: Let’s get 
rid of the filibuster. We didn’t. We 
didn’t. We told the President: It is not 
a good idea for the Senate, and it is not 
a good idea for the country. 
That is what we did when the shoe 
was on the other foot. We said no. It is 
not good for this body, and it is not 
good for the country. The Republican 
President was pushing: We need to get 
things done. We need to get rid of it. 
No. 
Let me just read a few of the things 
that were said recently about the ne-
cessity of keeping the filibuster. 
My friend from Delaware, in 2018, 
said: 
I am committed to never voting to change 
the legislative filibuster. 
Now, he said that when a Republican 
President was in the White House. 
My friend from New Jersey, in 2009, 
said: 
My colleagues and I—everybody I have 
talked to—believes the legislative filibuster 
should stay here, and I will personally resist 
any efforts to get rid of it. 
My Democratic friend from Montana 
said just a little over a year ago: 
I am a ‘‘no’’ on changing the filibuster. 
The move to make the Senate like the 
House, I think, is a mistake. 
I could go on. 
I don’t want the Senate to become like the 
House. The consequences of getting rid of the 
filibuster are too great. 
These are all words spoken very re-
cently by my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle. 
Even more impressive, just a few 
years ago, we had 61 Senators—33 Re-
publicans, 25 of whom are still here, 
and 30 Democrats, 27 of whom are still 
in the Senate today—who sent a letter. 
I have it right here. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD this letter sent 
to the Senate majority leader, MITCH 
MCCONNELL, and the Democratic lead-
er, Senator SCHUMER, saying we have 
to maintain the 60-vote threshold for 
filibusters involving legislation. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
UNITED STATES SENATE, 
Washington, DC, April 7, 2017. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
AND 
DEMOCRATIC LEADER SCHUMER: We are writ-
ing to urge you to support our efforts to pre-
serve existing rules, practices, and traditions 
as they pertain to the right of Members to 
engage in extended debate on legislation be-
fore the United States Senate. Senators have 
expressed a variety of opinions about the ap-
propriateness of limiting debate when we are 
considering judicial and executive branch 
nominations. Regardless of our past dis-
agreements on that issue, we are united in 
our determination to preserve the ability of 
Members to engage in extended debate when 
bills are on the Senate floor. 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great American institution continues to 
serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore, we are asking you to join us 
in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-
gage in full, robust, and extended debate as 
we consider legislation before this body in 
the future. 
Sincerely,

Orrin Hatch, Joe Manchin III, Claire McCas-
kill, John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, Patrick 
J. Leahy, Roger F. Wicker, Lindsey Graham,

United States Senators. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, this 
was sent in April 2017. Now, what was 
going on in April 2017? Republicans had 
the majority, and President Trump was 
pressuring us to get rid of the fili-
buster. We said no. 
This is what the letter said: 
Regardless of our past disagreements on 
that issue, we are united— 
Remember, 61 Senators, 27 Demo-
cratic Senators, who are still here, just 
3 years ago said this— 
we are united in our determination to pre-
serve the ability of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate when bills are on the Senate 
floor. 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring this 
great American institution— 
The U.S. Senate— 
continues to serve as the world’s greatest de-
liberative body. Therefore, we are asking you 
to join us in opposing any effort to curtail 
the existing rights and prerogatives of Sen-
ators to engage in full, robust, and extended 
debate as we consider legislation before this 
body in the future. 
That is the letter. Twenty-seven of 
my Democratic friends said ‘‘Don’t get 
rid of the filibuster’’ 3 years ago. Where 
are they now? 
Why is it that when this topic comes 
up, Senators MANCHIN and SINEMA are 
the only ones the media focuses on? 
How come they are not asking the 
questions of the other 25—one-quarter 
of the entire body—who wrote this let-
ter? What happened? Where is their 
conviction? 
When the shoe was on the other foot, 
we said we are not doing it, but they 
now want to do it. Nobody is asking 
them. I think the media should take a 
look at every Senator who signed this 
letter 3 years ago and say: Hey. Why 
did you change your opinion so quick-
ly? Three years ago, you were ada-
mantly against the filibuster, getting 
rid of it. What happened? Could it be 
that you now have power and you—but 
we didn’t do that when we had the 
power, when we had the White House. 
It is a really important question. Ac-
tually, it is so important, I would wel-
come any of my colleagues who signed 
the letter, Democrat or Republican, to 
come on down and explain to your con-
stituents, explain to the American peo-
ple why you switched so quickly and 
what you think it is going to do to the 
structure of the U.S. Senate and lit-
erally to our country. 
What strikes many of us is how, on so 
many issues, people change their side— 
it happens on both sides—when people 
are holding power from different per-
spectives. 
Let me provide another example that 
even hits our media friends. In 2004, 
when George W. Bush was President 
and Republicans had the majority, 
they were evidently considering get-
ting rid of the filibuster, and they 
didn’t. 
The New York Times wrote the fol-
lowing: 
The Republicans see the filibuster as an 
annoying obstacle, but it is actually one of 
the checks and balances that the founders, 
who worried greatly about the concentration 
of power, built into our system. 
It is the New York Times saying the 
Founders built the filibuster into our 
system. 
People who call themselves conservatives 
should find a way of achieving their goals 
without declaring war on one of the oldest 
traditions in American democracy. 
The filibuster. That is the New York 
Times. So Republicans heeded the ad-
vice of the New York Times. It doesn’t 
happen a lot, but it did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1721 
March 23, 2021 
So let’s see where the New York 
Times was on this one just about a 
month ago. 
The filibuster is a centuries-old parliamen-
tary tool that has been transformed into a 
weapon for strangling functional govern-
ment. The filibuster must go. 
Well, so much for the New York 
Times’s convictions. I wonder why they 
are changing their tune. I wonder why 
they are changing their tune. Probably 
the same reason that some of my 
Democratic colleagues are changing 
their tune after signing this letter. 
So I will end with one final quote. 
This is from a politician we all know 
well, all very familiar with him. It is 
from a speech on the Senate floor by 
U.S. Senator—in 2005, U.S. Senator 
Barack Obama. He spoke about how 
the American people expect their poli-
ticians to work to create a more per-
fect union. 
What they do not expect is for one party, 
be it Republican or Democrat— 
This is former Senator, former Presi-
dent Obama speaking right here on the 
floor— 
to change the rules in the middle of the 
game so that they can make all the decisions 
while the other party is told to sit down and 
keep quiet. 
Sounds a little bit like what is going 
on with this filibuster debate. 
I understand that Republicans are getting 
a lot of pressure to do this— 
‘‘This’’ meaning get rid of the fili-
buster— 
from factions outside the [Senate] Chamber, 
but we need to rise above the ‘‘ends justify 
the means’’ mentality because we are here to 
answer the people—all of the people, not just 
the ones who are wearing our particular 
party label. 
That was Senator Obama—former 
Senator 
Obama, 
former 
President 
Obama saying in 2005: Don’t do it, Re-
publicans. You have the power. You 
have the Presidency. You have the Sen-
ate. Don’t get rid of the filibuster. 
Well, I couldn’t agree more with our 
former President. Again, when we had 
the ability to do this just 3 years ago, 
we said no. 
I hope our friends in the media will 
write about this. Don’t hold your 
breath. But here is one instance when 
the shoe was on the other foot. Because 
it was so important to America, so im-
portant to this institution, we declined 
to make the power move. 
It would be really good—whether it is 
President Obama, who has spoken out 
about this now; or the New York 
Times, who has changed their tune; or 
all 25 of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle who signed this letter 
3 years ago saying ‘‘Don’t do it’’—come 
on down, speak to the American peo-
ple. Tell them why you have had such 
a drastic change of heart. 
But I will tell you this: If we do do it, 
you are going to regret it; we are going 
to regret it; the American people are 
going to regret it. And do you know 
what? In my discussions with some of 
my Democratic colleagues, and I am 
not going to name names, they know 
that. They know that. They are getting 
a lot of pressure. Majority Leader 
SCHUMER is getting a lot of pressure 
from the far left. 
Don’t let the far left ruin this insti-
tution. Don’t let the far left bludgeon 
you guys into changing America, be-
cause I think deep down in your heart 
of hearts, especially all of you who 
signed this letter 3 years ago know 
what the right thing to do for the U.S. 
Senate is and the right thing to do for 
the United States of America is, and it 
is to continue to keep what the Found-
ing Fathers devised for this body. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING 
JOANNE 
GOODWIN 
AND 
HER 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
SOUTH FLORIDA COMMUNITY 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Joanne Goodwin for her years of 
dedicated and unwavering service to our 
country and to the South Florida area. For 
decades, Joanne has made it her goal every 
day to make other people’s lives around her 
better, and has enjoyed a record of success 
throughout her career everyone ought to strive 
for. Born in 1947, in New York, she made her 
way to the National Association of Securities 
Dealers in the mid-1960’s where she became 
a registered trader. 
Beginning in 1979, she became the director 
of the Smith New Court Securities firm in Eng-
land. She used her expertise in her field to 
continue to break new barriers for women in 
her business and a host of others. In later 
years, Joanne made her way to the South 
Florida area, settling in Broward County in 
1999. She became especially active in the po-
litical sphere and worked tirelessly to elect 
candidates she felt were in the best interest of 
the American people. 
She first volunteered on John Kerry’s 2004 
presidential run, and became an active mem-
ber of the North Broward Democratic Club. 
Beginning in 2010, Goodwin became the 
president of the club, and has helped the party 
in-and-around the Fort Lauderdale area con-
tinue to blossom and grow each and every 
year since. She also volunteered on former 
congressman Ron Klein’s campaign for the 
House of Representatives, and congress-
woman LOIS FRANKEL’s in the same district. 
Goodwin has been recognized for her 
amazing work before. She has been named 
Broward County Volunteer of the Year three 
separate times, in 2013, 2015, and 2017. In 
2018, she was given the Broward Young 
Democrats Lifetime Young Democrat Award. 
In addition, she remains an avid reader, trav-
eler, and continues her commitment to elect-
ing 
progressive 
candidates, 
particularly 
women, up-and-down the ballot in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join

HON. KAY GRANGER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Major Daniel Naske of the 
U.S. Air Force, upon his departure from the 
Department of the Air Force, Directorate of 
Legislative Liaison. As Executive Officer, 
Major Naske serves as the critical bridge be-
tween key senior leaders within the Depart-
ment of Defense, to include the Secretary of 
the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, 
Chief of Space Operations and Members of 
Congress and the White House. His respon-
sibilities include leading a 6-member team in 
executing senior leader communication and 
resource support responding to 535 Members 
of Congress. His role as the principal advisor 
to the Director of Legislative Liaison’s ensures 
the Department’s strategic communication and 
vision is synchronized and thoughtfully exe-
cuted across 6 divisions and 85 members in 
the planning of over 200 Member engage-
ments on Department programs, policies and 
weapon systems. 
Major Naske is a native of upstate New 
York and is a Distinguished Graduate from 
Clarkson University ROTC with a degree in 
Electrical Engineering. He also holds a Master 
of Arts in Military History from American Mili-
tary University, and is a 2019 graduated De-
fense Legislative Fellow. 
Major Naske began his flying career in 
2009, and was first assigned as a pilot of the 
MC–12W reconnaissance aircraft. In 2011, 
Major Naske became qualified on the C–17A 
Globemaster Ill and became an Instructor Pilot 
in 2013. Additionally, he is a graduate of the 
esteemed U.S. Air Force Weapons School. 
Major Naske’s exemplary U.S. Air Force ca-
reer spans more than 2,741 hours in airlift and 
reconnaissance aircraft, and of that, 1,002 are 
in combat. 
Major Naske and his wife, Caitlin, have two 
beautiful daughters, Ava and Mara and his 
family continues to support him and his serv-
ice to our nation. 
We wish Major Naske the best of luck in his 
new role leading an operational C–17 unit as 
the Director of Operations. Madam Speaker, 
on behalf of the U.S. Congress and a grateful 
Nation, I extend our deepest appreciation to 
Major Daniel Naske for his dedicated service 
to the U.S. Air Force, and to our Nation.

COMMENDING 
AND 
CONGRATU-
LATING JUDGE ANITA SUKOLA 
ON THE OCCASION OF HER RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a true public servant and a 
fine example of women leadership, the Honor-
able Anita A. Sukola. I congratulate her on her 
retirement after 36 years of service to the peo-
ple of Guam in our government as a re-
spected educator, attorney, and judge. 
Early in her career, Judge Anita Sukola 
maintained a firm commitment to the better-
ment of our community through education. 
After graduating from John F. Kennedy High 
School in 1969, she went on to Washington 
State University and earned her bachelor’s de-
gree in History and Secondary Education. 
Hoping to foster her same passion for growth 
and learning in others, she became a full-time 
educator in the public school system while 
working towards her master’s degree in Ad-
ministration and Supervision. By 1983, Judge 
Sukola obtained her Juris Doctor from the 
People’s College of Law and expanded her 
role in educating our island’s youth through 
her appointment as Deputy Director of the De-
partment of Education. The following year, she 
was confirmed to serve as the DOE Director 
and continued her service through this position 
until 1991. During her tenure at DOE, she si-
multaneously contributed to our island commu-
nity as Chairperson for the Government of 
Guam Retirement Fund Board of Directors for 
eight years. Her role as an educator also ex-
tended beyond the public school system with 
an assistant professorship at the University of 
Guam’s Criminal Justice program. In this ca-
pacity, she helped to develop minds that 
would eventually go on to pursue careers in 
various areas of law, police, probation, social 
work, and other security and military organiza-
tions. 
Upon closing her chapter with DOE, Judge 
Sukola established a private practice along-
side late Justice Monessa G. Lujan and 
served Guam through this partnership for 
nearly 11 years. Prior to her judgeship, she 
further fortified her legal expertise through 
service as an attorney with the Public De-
fender Service Corporation, Legal Counsel for

the Port Authority of Guam Board of Directors 
and Chamorro Land Trust Commission, and 
Staff Attorney to former Senator Don Parkin-
son of the 17th Guam Legislature. Dem-
onstrating her sharp mind, capacity for excel-
lence, and disposition of fairness for almost 
two decades in law, Judge Sukola established 
herself as a champion of justice and respected 
pillar of our community. In 2002, Governor 
Carl T.C. Gutierrez recognized these out-
standing qualities and appointed her to serve 
as a trial court judge at the Judiciary of Guam, 
wherein she handled a diverse docket ranging 
from family violence cases to complex civil liti-
gation. In addition to her various court assign-
ments of General Jurisdiction, Mental Health 
Court, Family Court I, and Juvenile Drug 
Court, Judge Sukola also brought new mean-
ing to the mission of making justice accessible 
to all as a Co-Chair of the Judiciary’s Juvenile 
Justice Reform Focus Area on Evidence- 
Based Practices and 2016–2019 Strategic 
Plan Focus Area on Access to Courts and De-
livery of Services as well as the Subcommit-
tees on Pro-Se Litigation and Criminal Jury In-
structions. 
Throughout her career and in her judicial 
service, Judge Sukola has built an exemplary 
legacy of compassionate service and under-
standing through professionalism which doubly 
emanates from her courtroom. Recognized for 
her interminable advocacy for the welfare and 
best interests of Guam’s children and their 
families while specifically advancing the Sys-
tem of Care and Wraparound in the Juvenile 
Court System and promoting cultural sensi-
tivity, Judge Sukola received the icareguam 
2017 Goodwill Ambassador Award. Judge 
Anita Sukola served our island with incredible 
distinction and continues to inspire many 
members of our community. Madam Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the people of Guam, offer-
ing 
my 
greatest 
appreciation for Judge 
Sukola’s commitment to justice for all on our 
island. Her dedication to our youth and fami-
lies, fidelity to justice, and unwavering integrity 
is commendable, and I sincerely thank her for 
her many years of service, congratulate her on 
a well-deserved retirement, and wish her the 
best as she embarks on a new chapter in life.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE BENGALI 
HINDU GENOCIDE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in sad remembrance of the 50th anniversary 
of the Bengali Hindu Genocide, and celebrate 
and honor the lives of the more than two mil-
lion Bengali Hindu persons who were system-
atically killed by the Pakistani Army when it 
launched an offensive into East Pakistan, 
present-day Bangladesh, thus beginning the 
10-month reign of terror known as ‘‘Operation 
Searchlight.’’ 
Over that time, approximately 2 to 3 million 
people were killed, over 200,000 women were 
raped in organized rape camps, and over 10 
million people were displaced, most finding 
refuge in India. 
I offer my prayers and condolences to the 
victims and their families who still feel the very 
real effects of this heinous crime against hu-
manity. 
March 25th officially marks the beginning of 
the genocide in Bangladesh. 
The brutality unleashed by the Pakistani 
army and the targeting of Bengali Hindus sim-
ply because of their religion must be strongly 
condemned as religious freedom is one of the 
most sacred of human rights. 
It has been 50 years since the genocide in 
Bangladesh, and the survivors and their de-
scendants are still fighting for recognition; they 
are still fighting for an apology from Pakistan, 
as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh formerly 
asked her Pakistani counterpart as recently as 
January of 2021; and they are still fighting for 
justice and for closure. 
On March 28, 1971, Archer K. Blood, U.S. 
Consul General stationed in Dhaka, East Paki-
stan, present-day Bangladesh, during the 
genocide, sent a cable back to Foggy Bottom 
with the subject reading ‘‘Selective Genocide.’’ 
In his cable, the Consul General informs his 
superiors at the State Department that ‘‘Here 
in Dacca we are mute and horrified witnesses 
to a reign of terror by the Pak military,’’ and 
that the full horror of its atrocities ‘‘will come 
to light sooner or later.’’ 
That is why I rise; to remember and ac-
knowledge that history so that victims and sur-
vivors of the Bengali Hindu Genocide know 
that the people of the United States stand in 
solidarity with them.

IN RECOGNITION OF JILL SELLERS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Jill Sellers on 
her new role as the Executive Director of Main 
Street Gettysburg, a non-profit organization 
committed to the preservation and revitaliza-
tion of historic Gettysburg. 
In this new role, Jill will collaborate with 
community leaders and volunteers to steward 
the mission of Main Street Gettysburg. Since 
first visiting Gettysburg two decades ago, Jill 
has been a passionate advocate for this town 
and community. 
Jill has extensive leadership and manage-
ment experience. Prior to moving to Adams 
County, Jill founded a public relations firm and 
served as the President of the Weston County 
Hospital in Wyoming. Earlier in her career, she 
served as an intelligence officer with the De-
fense Intelligence Agency as a program man-
ager for Northrop Grumman. Jill is a graduate 
of the Middlebury Institute of International 
Studies, where she earned a master’s degree 
in international policy. 
Jill Sellers will be an incredible partner to 
small businesses and the tourism community 
in Adams County. I congratulate Jill on this 
new chapter, and I look forward to working 
alongside her to serve the Gettysburg commu-
nity. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER 
OF HEATHER SCHAFE 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay my respects to Ms. Heather Schafer, 
former Chief Executive Officer of the National 
Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC). She passed 
away unexpectedly on March 15, 2021. 
Celebrating its 45th year of service, the 
NVFC is the leading nonprofit association rep-
resenting the interests of the volunteer fire, 
EMS, and rescue services. Ms. Schafer began 
her career with the NVFC in 1993, and within 
one year of service became the NVFC’s Exec-
utive Director and CEO. 
Madam Speaker, I know you are well aware 
of my passion for supporting our firefighters 
and emergency services personnel. They are 
our first responders to all disasters. They face 
daunting challenges which require high levels 
of training and specialized equipment. 
They need strong voices at the local, state, 
and national levels to ensure that their needs 
are addressed by government officials. Heath-
er Schafer provided such a voice, always ad-
vocating forcefully for our volunteer fire-
fighters. Her passion for nonprofit work led her 
to the NVFC and her bold leadership and vi-
sion grew the organization and advanced the 
interests of the volunteer fire service and the 
health and safety of its members. 
As we celebrate National Women’s History 
Month, let us remember women like Ms. 
Schafer who serve as role models for young 
women seeking careers in professions tradi-
tionally occupied by their male counterparts. 
The fire and emergency services is one such 
profession. 
Ms. Schafer leaves behind a legacy of great 
accomplishment over her 27 years of stead-
fast service managing the NVFC. And her 
contribution to a more equitable society for 
women and all Americans is surely among her 
greatest achievements. 
On behalf of the Congressional Fire Serv-
ices Caucus, I extend my deepest sympathies 
to Ms. Schafer’s family, friends, and staff for 
the loss of a remarkable and talented leader 
of our nation’s volunteer fire and emergency 
services.

Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Jewish Adoption and Family 
Care Center’s declaration of intent agreement 
with the State of Israel. JAFCO continues to 
provide support to children affected by disabil-
ities at risk of abuse or neglect in the United 
States. 
JAFCO was established as a non-profit in 
1992. The JAFCO Children’s Village is among 
the rarest programs of its kind around the 
country. The partnership with the Israel Min-
istry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Social Serv-
ices, or MOLSA, will help both entities refer 
requests for foster care, consultation, support 
services and more. 
JAFCO and MOLSA have seen their efforts 
overlap over the past 25 years, making this 
partnership all the more important towards 
providing help for children in need. Both have 
done phenomenal work servicing special 
needs kids. This partnership can help mend 
any unmet necessities for children in the Jew-
ish community. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in sup-
porting this partnership and commending the 
invaluable work JAFCO and MOLSA have 
done over the years to bring help to children 
and families in need.

INTRODUCTION OF THE KEEPING 
OUR 
MANUFACTURERS 
FROM 
BEING UNFAIRLY TAXED WHILE 
CHAMPIONING 
HEALTH 
ACT 
(KOMBUCHA) 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Keeping Our Manufacturers 
from being Unfairly taxed while Championing 
Health Act (KOMBUCHA). This legislation 
would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 to properly tax kombucha, a fermented 
tea, naturally rich in probiotics and healthy 
acids, that can contain trace amounts of alco-
hol. 
Last month, on February 21, we commemo-
rated World Kombucha Day and acknowl-
edged the many contributions of kombucha 
brewers in my home State of Oregon, across 
the United States, and around the world. With 
the introduction of KOMBUCHA, the United 
States Congress now can extend that ac-
knowledgement to legislative action by pro-
viding the industry with much-needed relief. 
Under 
the 
Internal 
Revenue 
Code, 
kombucha beverages with more than 0.5 per-
cent alcohol-by-volume are subject to excise 
taxes intended for beer. As a result of the fer-
mentation process that is necessary to 
produce kombucha, some final products may 
contain more than 0.5 percent alcohol-by-vol-
ume, subjecting the industry to onerous excise 
taxes. But kombucha drinkers do not choose 
the product because of its alcohol content, 
they choose it as a healthy beverage option. 
My legislation would increase the alcohol- 
by-volume limit for kombucha to 1.25 percent, 
properly categorizing the product and allowing 
the kombucha industry to continue its growth. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senator WYDEN in the Sen-
ate to provide this relief as soon as possible.

LIFESTREAM 
BE-
HAVIORAL CENTER’S 50 YEARS 
OF SERVICE 
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to recognize LifeStream Be-
havioral Center as they commemorate 50 
years of service in bringing hope to life during 
the month of March. LifeStream is dedicated 
to their mission of supporting recovery, pro-
moting health and creating hope. Over the 
years LifeStream has grown to meet the 
needs of our communities and become a lead-
er in behavioral health, substance use dis-
orders, and social services. 
In 1969, LifeStream began as a component 
of Waterman Memorial Hospital in Eustis, Flor-
ida, providing community-based care as an al-
ternative 
to 
institutionalization. 
In 
1971, 
LifeStream became a non-profit organization, 
originally founded as Lake/Sumter Community 
Mental Health Center, with 18 inpatient beds 
located inside Waterman Hospital and two out-
patient clinics located in Lake and Sumter 
Counties. 
Since its founding, LifeStream has ex-
panded to multiple facilities with over 50 pro-
grams and 1,000 staff providing services 
throughout Central Florida, proudly serving the 
individuals and families of Lake, Sumter, Cit-
rus, 
Hernando, 
Marion, 
Orange, 
and 
Hillsborough Counties. As a leader in behav-
ioral healthcare, LifeStream offers a multi-dis-
ciplinary approach helping people reclaim their 
lives and take what for many is their first step 
towards hope. Their integrated health system 
provides behavioral health, substance use, pri-
mary healthcare, and social services. For 50 
years, LifeStream has helped thousands of in-
dividuals in our community achieve recovery 
and reach their highest potential. 
This is a momentous year for LifeStream, 
and I am honored to join my friend, Jonathan 
Cherry, CEO/President of LifeStream in cele-
brating this milestone. The community and 
families of Central Florida are blessed to have 
a committed behavioral health center such as 
LifeStream, and I commend them for the 
measures they are undertaking to support re-
covery and provide hope to those in need. 
IN RECOGNITION OF ST. GEORGE 
GREEK ORTHODOX CATHEDRAL’S 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
THE 
BICEN-
TENNIAL OF GREEK INDEPEND-
ENCE 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to congratulate St. 
George Greek Orthodox Cathedral on their 
celebration of this, the Bicentennial of Greek 
Independence. Their continued efforts to sup-
port, preserve and promote their Greek cul-
ture, as well as honor the heroes of 1821 and 
the sacrifices they made in pursuit of Greek 
independence, are truly remarkable and de-
serving of the highest praise. 
The parishioners of St. George Greek Or-
thodox Cathedral are stewards of their cul-
ture’s rich history, celebrating and honoring 
the sacrifices made by their forefathers during 
their fight for freedom. With the signing of the 
Treaty of Edirne in 1829, eight years after the 
inception of the War of Greek Independence, 
the independent state of Greece was finally 
established. St. George Greek Orthodox Ca-
thedral has been a vital member of the Great-
er Springfield community since 1907, and gen-
erations of parishioners have faithfully com-
memorated Greek independence for more 
than a century. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to once again 
acknowledge St. George Greek Orthodox Ca-
thedral for their extraordinary efforts and su-
perb achievement. Their dedication to pre-
serving the traditions of their religion and their 
culture is admirable, and I wish them many 
more years of health and prosperity.

Over the past year, they have faced chal-

have shown incredible resolve in the face of 
adversity. They have shown us all how to 
seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-
working individuals.

IN RECOGNITION OF MOM’S HOUSE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Mom’s House, a com-
munity organization assisting women and fam-
ilies, for its service to Johnstown, Pennsyl-
vania and surrounding communities. 
In 1983, Mom’s House was established in 
Johnstown to offer support to victims of abuse 
and women in need. By providing childcare 
services, Mom’s House helps mothers to com-
plete their education at the high school or 
post-secondary level while raising a family. 
Mom’s House also offers parents counseling 
and other vital resources. 
The success of Mom’s House in Johnstown 
has led to the establishment of seven other 
Mom’s House organizations in four states and 
plans for additional centers arc currently in de-
velopment. 
Mom’s House works to serve families while 
protecting each person’s unalienable right to 
life. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Con-
gressional District, it is my honor to recognize 
this outstanding organization and thank the 
leaders and volunteers at Mom’s House for 
their service to the Johnstown community.

HONORING THE WOMEN OF STEEL 
AS 
WE 
CELEBRATE 
WOMEN’S 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I rise today 
in observance of Women’s History Month and 
its 2021 theme—Valiant Women of the Vote: 
Refusing to be Silenced. Each year, the Na-
tional Women’s History Project selects a uni-
fying theme to recognize and promote Wom-
en’s History Month. This year’s theme recog-
nizes the passage of the 19th Amendment 
and honors the stories of those women who 
have fought for equal rights in the workplace. 
Prior to the right to vote, women were in-
strumental in organizing workplaces, most fa-
mously during the Bread and Roses Strike of 
1912. Tens of thousands of women fought for 
more than wages and working conditions; they 
fought to be respected in the workplace. For 
generations since, women have contributed to 
resolving conflicts and have persevered tire-
lessly to promote equality in the workplace. 
Women have insisted upon and continue to 
fight for respect, justice, and equality. Today, 
I would like to take a moment to honor 
Women of Steel, an advocacy-arm of the 
United Steelworkers, which evolved from the 
early women’s caucuses that demanded 
women have their rightful place in the work-
place. Throughout the years, women from di-
verse backgrounds have played an instru-
mental role in paving the way for women in 
the steel industry. 
Among these remarkable leaders was Ola 
Kennedy. Ola was a resident of Gary, Indiana, 
who passed away in 2009. Ola worked for 28 
years at Hammond Valve. A devoted commu-
nity leader, she was involved in many union 
and civic organizations and was one of the 
founding members of the Coalition of Black 
Trade Unionists in addition to being a member 
of the NAACP and holding various positions at 
Local Union 1273, District 31 United Steel-
workers, District 31 Women’s Caucus, and 
Steelworkers Fightback Organization. 
We also celebrate Roberta Wood. In the 
1970s, Roberta Wood went to work in the 
male-dominated mill in the union’s former Dis-
trict 31 in Gary, Indiana. Along with Ola, Ro-
berta co-founded the steelworker women’s 
caucus in the Chicago/Gary district of the 
Steelworkers union. In 1976, she was elected 
the first female member of USWA Local 65’s 
Executive Board and is currently a member of 
the Steelworkers Organization of Active Retir-
ees where she continues to advocate for fu-
ture generations. 
I would also like to take a moment to recog-
nize those women who have recently cele-
brated 
more 
than 
five 
decades 
at 
ArcelorMittal, which is now Cleveland-Cliffs: 
Gail Richardson, a native of East Chicago and 
a safety advocate at Indiana Harbor; Judith 
Studer, a senior clerical technician in the 
maintenance, environmental and utilities de-
partment at Burns Harbor; and Maria Garcia, 
a materials management coordinator in the lo-
gistics department at Indiana Harbor. 
Today, the Women of Steel continue to ad-
vocate for more women in leadership and 
carry on the march to fight for full gender 
equality in the workplace. I commend these 
women and the many others who fought and 
continue to fight alongside them for women of 
every creed, class, and ethnic background. 
These fearless, strong, and vocal women are 
exemplary role models who reflect the 2021 
theme, Valiant Women of the Vote: Refusing 
to be Silenced. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to join in 
celebrating Women’s History Month and rec-
ognizing the role Women of Steel have played 
to organize, unionize, rally, and inspire work-
ers to fight for justice. I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in cele-
brating the impact these extraordinary women 
have made in labor history and their continued 
contributions to the labor movement and our 
nation.

RECOGNIZING MIKKIE BELVEDERE 
AND HER SERVICE TO COCONUT 
CREEK AND SOUTH FLORIDA 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 23, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Mikkie Belvedere for her years of 
public service in South Florida. Mikkie was 
born in Israel, lived in New York City, in St. 
Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and has been a 
resident of South Florida since 1992. 
Commissioner Belvedere is a financial pro-
fessional who has spent years putting her ex-
pertise to good use to better her local commu-
nity. She was first elected to the Coconut 
Creek City Commission in 2009, where she 
has served in the roles of Mayor and Vice 
Mayor of Coconut Creek. Prior to her service 
as a city commissioner, Commissioner Bel-
vedere spent years working to better Coconut 
Creek, serving on the city’s Planing and Zon-
ing Board, the Affordable Housing Advisory 
Committee, and as the chair of the Coconut 
Creek Environmental Advisory Board. Com-
missioner Belvedere served as an ambas-
sador committee representative and charter 
member for the Coconut Creek Chamber of 
Commerce. 
In addition to her years of public service, 
Commissioner Belvedere has had a positive 
impact on communities in Coconut Creek and 
throughout South Florida. The founder of the 
Coconut Creek Multicultural center, Mikkie 
Belvedere also is a member of the Wynmoor 
Hurricane Emergency Network and a member 
of the Coconut Creek Community Emergency 
Response Team. She is a Trustee of the Sis-
terhood of Liberal Jewish Temple and the 
president of the Hebrew club of Wynmoor. 
She is a former member of the Sawgrass As-
sociation of insurance and Financial Advisors 
and a former participant of the Broward Men-
toring Program. For the past decade and a 
half, Commissioner Belvedere has volunteered 
with the Broward County Prime Time Program, 
where she reads to children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mikkie Belvedere and her 
service to the South Florida community and 
Florida’s 22nd Congressional District.
