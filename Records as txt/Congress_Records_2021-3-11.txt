Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2021 
No. 46 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, a year ago normal was 
turned on its head, national pastimes 
canceled their seasons, and Broadway 
went dark. Since then, our whole lives 
have been tragically upended, and our 
sense of health and welfare forever 
threatened. 
But You in Your mercy have set be-
fore us many who have stood firm in 
the face of this year of incredible dis-
ruption and uncertainty. 
God, we offer our deep-felt gratitude 
for the frontline workers—medical per-
sonnel and first responders—as well as 
those who have borne the responsi-
bility for maintaining the Nation’s in-
frastructure in all its forms—sanita-
tion, communication, transportation. 
We lift up to You in thanksgiving all 
teachers, counselors, caregivers, and 
parents who have upheld their commit-
ment to the well-being and the future 
of our country. 
I offer this prayer in these Chambers 
because each of us, and the American 
Government itself, is beholden to the 
scores of Capitol Police, staff members, 
and concession workers who, without 
fail or fanfare, have executed their du-
ties in humility and faithfulness. 
For their sacrificial dedication, the 
hours of watch-standing and lost fam-
ily time, God, we owe them a debt of 
gratitude for helping to bring us 
through this tumultuous year. 
When our words fail us and our ap-
preciation for these noble public serv-
ants proves inadequate, we pray that 
You would speak Your special blessing 
on them and give them assurance of 
Your eternal reward. 
We offer our prayers to You in the 
strength of Your name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
5(a)(1)(A) of House Resolution 8, the 
Journal of the last day’s proceedings is 
approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. ZELDIN) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. ZELDIN led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
ARTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE 
IN OUR LIVES 
(Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
BONAMICI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these are challenging times for every-
one, including for our Nation’s young 
people, who are trying to cope with 
growing up and learning during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
At this challenging time, arts edu-
cation is more important than ever. 
The arts provide a way to help people 
connect and cope; and after this crisis, 
the arts will continue to play an im-
portant role in helping to heal. 
In recognition of Music in Our 
Schools Month, I want to highlight the 
value of music education. My mom was 
a piano teacher, and I took lessons my-
self. I know music is an important part 
of a well-rounded education. It helps 
students 
become 
critical, 
creative 
thinkers across subjects and eventually 
in their careers. 
Yesterday, I spoke with band and 
choir educators from Oregon, who are 
working to safely reengage students in 
in-person music classes. I thank them, 
and I am grateful that the American 
Rescue Plan will provide funding to 
help schools open safely, including 
those important band and choir class-
es. 
Please join me in supporting music 
education. 
f 
PROUDLY STANDING WITH GUN 
OWNERS 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, H.R. 8 
and H.R. 1446 are attempts by the Fed-
eral Government to exert more force 
over law-abiding citizens who want to 
protect themselves and their families. 
Let me remind my Democrat col-
leagues that the Second Amendment 
explicitly states that the right to keep 
and bear arms shall not be infringed. 
Maybe they would remember that if 
they carried a pocket copy of the Con-
stitution with them like I do every sin-
gle day. Apparently not. 
I am proud to stand with the millions 
of gun owners in this great country 
who share an abiding gratitude for the 
Constitution and the Second Amend-
ment itself. 
Make no mistake, these bills are cre-
ated in bad faith. They are partisan 
shams that rob us of our freedoms.

HELP IS ON THE WAY 
(Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1330 
March 11, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to echo the words of our President: 
Americans, help is on the way. 
The House of Representatives and 
Senate have passed the rescue bill, and 
there is money for vaccinations, money 
to open the schools, and money for 
small businesses. The opportunity to 
revise and rebuild our economy is at 
hand. The President will soon sign this 
legislation, and help is on the way. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE 125TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF JEWISH WAR VET-
ERANS OF THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA 
(Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 125th anni-
versary of the Jewish War Veterans of 
the United States of America. 
Jewish War Veterans was founded on 
March 15, 1896, by 63 Jewish Civil War 
veterans 
after 
several 
anti-Semitic 
comments were made claiming there 
was a lack of Jewish participation dur-
ing the Civil War. 
Since then, the Jewish War Veterans 
have made it their mission to fight 
anti-Semitism and advocate for Jewish 
servicemembers and veterans from all 
walks of life. 
Whether it was supporting Jewish 
servicemembers fighting Nazi Germany 
during World War II or establishing the 
National Museum of American Jewish 
History, the Jewish War Veterans have 
never stopped supporting its members, 
Jewish servicemembers, and our vet-
erans. 
As a fellow member of the Jewish 
War Veterans, thank you for your serv-
ice to our Nation and our veterans, and 
congratulations again on 125 incredible 
years. May there be many more to 
come. 
f 
CRUSHING THE VIRUS AND 
PROTECTING OUR ECONOMY 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to talk about possibly 
the most important bill this House has 
passed in recent years. 
Yesterday, we passed the American 
Rescue Plan, a bill that spends $1.9 tril-
lion to crush the virus and protect our 
economy. For the cities in my district, 
this means $615 million to Houston, $42 
million for Pasadena, $2.3 million for 
Galena 
Park, 
$3.8 
million 
fo11-15r 
South Houston, and $2.2 million for 
San Jacinto City. 
That is money that keeps first re-
sponders on the job. That is money 
that keeps our water running and our 
trash picked up, and it is also money 
that keeps families together. 
But beyond the numbers, this is the 
greatest antipoverty bill since Social 
Security. This bill cuts Hispanic pov-
erty by 39 percent and African-Amer-
ican poverty by 42 percent. 
Madam Speaker, we have to continue 
to build on these efforts. I want to 
thank all of my colleagues for coming 
together to fight poverty on a scale 
that we truly need. 
f 
KAIA HENDERSON IS A HUMBLE 
LEADER 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, the 
GOAT, the Greatest of All Time, that 
is 
how 
Coach 
Mike 
Callan, 
the 
winningest women’s basketball coach 
in my hometown of New Hartford, New 
York, described junior sensation Kaia 
Henderson. 
Not only is Kaia one of the top 50 
women’s high school basketball re-
cruits in the Nation, she is also a 
straight-A student, a humble leader, 
and a viral sensation. Kaia scored her 
2,000th point this week, even with a 
dramatically shortened season due to 
the COVID virus. 
Coach Callan describes Kaia as a spe-
cial player whose work ethic shows on 
the court and in the record books, 
where she holds at least 12 other school 
records for the Spartans. Kaia herself 
remains humble, noting she is focused 
on winning and helping her team get to 
sectionals next season. 
Kaia is inspired by her beloved mom, 
Kristen, who passed away in 2014, who 
was devoted to Kaia’s success. She also 
credits her dad, Aurelius, and four big 
brothers—Troy, Isaiah, and twins Jared 
and Jordan—who push her to new lim-
its each day. 
But there is more. She has now start-
ed a viral 10,000-hour challenge during 
the height of the pandemic to inspire 
others to perfect a craft. Check out the 
10K hours challenge. 
Congratulations to Kaia on her in-
credible success on and off the court. 
f 
WE WILL MISS YOU, JOE NOVOTNY 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
this month is the end of an era, as Joe 
Novotny concludes a 30-year career in 
the House, the last 10 as our Reading 
Clerk. 
He assumed that role naturally with 
quiet competence. He was unflappable 
in the midst of often frantic activity. 
He is the face of a critically important 
and complex set of activities that 
keeps the House legislative process 
moving forward. Even when it seems 
like we are not doing much, it takes a 
lot of people to make it look that way. 
He was born for this important role, 
having literally grown up in the House 
as a House page to see firsthand the 
legislative process. His rise through 
the ranks culminated with his decade 
as the House Reading Clerk. He has 
steadily and thoughtfully performed 
his duties in an exemplary fashion, 
being helpful, a perfect representation 
for the many men and women behind 
the scenes who hold this place to-
gether. 
I, along with thousands of C–SPAN 
junkies will miss you, Joe, and we all 
wish you well, the very best in the next 
chapter of your career and life. 
f 
ELECTION ISSUES IN WISCONSIN 
(Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to highlight one of the many 
reasons for my objection on Wiscon-
sin’s election certification. 
A recent story out of Green Bay has 
highlighted possible improprieties dur-
ing this past November’s election. The 
story alleges that campaign operatives 
acted as de facto members of the city 
clerk’s office and disrupted a fair elec-
tion process. 
I call on State officials to investigate 
this serious matter, as election integ-
rity is the priority for an over-
whelming majority of my constituents. 
If signed into law, the recently 
passed radical H.R. 1 will not only cod-
ify the types of issues we have seen 
across Wisconsin, it will disenfranchise 
many voters across our great State and 
our country. 
f 
PROCEDURAL MOTIONS TO 
RECOMMIT 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to make clear that the motions 
to recommit that will be offered by our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are procedural. They are not motions 
that are sending back the legislation 
with instructions. It is a procedural 
move. I want to be clear and read lit-
erally what the motion to recommit 
says. 
Motion to recommit H.R. 8, offered 
by Mr. JORDAN of Ohio, moves to re-
commit the bill, H.R. 8, to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. That is it. 
Motion to recommit H.R. 1446, of-
fered by Mr. HUDSON of North Carolina, 
moves to recommit H.R. 1446 to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
These are fake attempts to recommit 
these bills and to stop them from mov-
ing forward. They are sensible pieces of 
legislation that will save lives.

MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTION 
TO ALS DISABILITY INSURANCE 
ACCESS ACT OF 2019 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to 
take from the Speaker’s table the bill 
(S. 579) to make a technical correction 
to the ALS Disability Insurance Access 
Act of 2019, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS of Georgia). Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
California? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 579 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. RETROACTIVE ACCESS TO SOCIAL SE-
CURITY DISABILITY BENEFITS INDI-
VIDUALS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LAT-
ERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS). 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2(b) of the ALS 
Disability Insurance Access Act of 2019 (Pub-
lic Law 116–250) is amended by striking ‘‘ap-
plications for disability insurance benefits 
filed after the date of enactment of this Act’’ 
and inserting ‘‘applications for disability in-
surance benefits approved after the date that 
is 5 months before the date of enactment of 
this Act’’. 
(b) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by this section shall take effect as if 
included in the enactment of the ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act of 2019 (Public 
Law 116–250). 
The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time, was read the third time, 
and passed, and a motion to reconsider 
was laid on the table.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. HOYER), the majority leader of the 
House, for the purpose of inquiring as 
to the schedule for next week. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the 
House will meet at noon for morning- 
hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative 
business, with votes expected no earlier 
than 6:30 p.m. 
On Wednesday, the House will meet 
at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 
noon for legislative business. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
noon for legislative business. 
On Friday, the House will meet at 9 
a.m. for legislative business, with the 
last votes no later than 3 p.m. 
Madam Speaker, we will consider 
several bills under suspension of the 
rules. The complete list of suspension 
bills will be announced by the close of 
business Friday. 
In addition, we will consider two bills 
to honor Women’s History Month, in-
cluding the Violence Against Women 
Act. This legislation is essential to 
help stamp out domestic abuse, vio-
lence against women and girls, and sex-
ual harassment, and to provide victims 
and survivors with the resources to re-
cover and seek justice. In addition to 
that, the House will consider a resolu-
tion to remove the deadline for ratifi-
cation of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. 
The House will also consider two bills 
to address our broken immigration sys-
tem. The first, H.R. 6, the American 
Dream and Promise Act, is to protect 
Dreamers and those with TPS and DED 
status. In addition, the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act is to create a 
pathway for agricultural workers to 
earn legal status and to reform the H– 
2A program, a bill which enjoys broad 
bipartisan support. 
Additionally, the House will consider 
a bill to ensure that we preclude cuts 
to Medicare, as well as farm supports 
and other programs implicated by se-
questration. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, and I appreciate 
the update on the schedule. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask 
the gentleman, we have been getting a 
number of concerns expressed from 
Members on our side—and I would 
imagine on the gentleman’s side as 
well—about the erratic floor schedule, 
the changes that have occurred. This 
week, we were supposed to be here 
Tuesday to Friday. It was changed to 
Monday to Thursday. Next week, ini-
tially, the calendar showed that it was 
a week for Members to be in their dis-
tricts. 
Madam Speaker, we all have chal-
lenges in our districts. There are small 
businesses that are struggling to stay 
afloat. Many Members are working 
with their local school boards to try to 
encourage schools to reopen. And all 
the other challenges that people have, 
whether it is trying to get water or 
spread distribution of the vaccine, as 
they set those meetings in their dis-
tricts, when the floor schedule changes 
here, it disrupts their ability to prop-
erly represent their districts. 
I know the schedule is laid out for 
the year for a reason, so that Members 
can manage both the schedule here— 
and we all represent 750,000 people, 
roughly, back home—and the ability to 
properly meet with and represent con-
stituents who aren’t even allowed to 
come to this Capitol to meet with us, 
so we want to go meet with them back 
home. It is hard to do that when the 
schedule continues to change. 
If the gentleman would address the 
concerns that have been raised, right-
fully so, about those erratic changes, I 
yield to the gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I agree with the Members, and I re-
gret that we have had such a necessity 
on too many occasions to change the 
schedule. We did so, of course, to ac-
commodate not only work done but 
also the very, very unusual start that 
we have had to this session, a tragic 
start that we have had to this session, 
dealing with issues that we would have 
preferred not to deal with, but we had 
to as a result of the insurrection that 
occurred on January 6, and other ac-
tions, including the security that the 
gentleman referred to. That concerns 
us all. 
As somebody who represents the 
Washington metropolitan region, the 
openness of our Capitol is of particular 
concern to me because my constituents 
all live within driving distance, an 
hour or less. So, I share the view. 
Madam Speaker, I want to assure 
Members that we are going to make 
every effort and that we are trying to 
now finalize. We already have April, 
May, June, and July as the schedule. I 
think that will not be changed in any 
dramatic fashion. But when we have 
the final, I hope to make sure that ev-
erybody, next week, before we leave 
here, knows what is going to happen in 
April, May, June, July, before the Au-
gust break. Because I understand, when 
the schedule is changed, for whatever 
reasons, however justified they may be, 
it does disrupt. 
Although I heard some criticism last 
Wednesday that we didn’t come in 
Thursday, no Member came up to me 
complaining that we didn’t come in 
Thursday. I did hear some political rap 
about it, but I didn’t hear any Members 
say, ‘‘Oh, jeez, I really wanted to come 
in Thursday.’’ That usually is the case. 
Madam Speaker, I want to remind 
the gentleman that we got all of our 
work done last week. All that was 
scheduled was done. 
I will assure the gentleman that we 
are working very hard so that, the next 
4 months, Members can rely on it when 
they see on the calendar that they 
have to be here or they don’t have to 
be here, or that we are going to con-
sider this, that, and the other. 
We are going to try to hew very, very 
closely to that because I do appreciate 
that when you change the schedule, it 
is very disruptive for people’s lives, for 
people’s businesses, for our constitu-
ents. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Maryland. 
I appreciate the acknowledgment 
about the concerns and the disruptions 
of schedules as Members try to meet 
the needs of their constituents back 
home, as well as doing the work up 
here. Clearly, getting our work done is 
the first and most important priority 
to addressing those needs. 
Hopefully, as we look toward our re-
turn after we come back in April, the 
appropriations process will begin. We 
would surely like to see us get back to 
a more regular order for doing appro-
priations bills, where we can have bills

H1335 
March 11, 2021 
go through committee, go through a 
markup process, with bipartisan input, 
which we haven’t seen, but, ultimately, 
be able to bring those bills to the floor 
with a typical, traditional amendment 
process. 
Madam Speaker, I know the gen-
tleman is well aware of this. Histori-
cally, when appropriations bills come 
to the floor, there are many amend-
ments. Sometimes, it is a completely 
wide-open amendment process, which 
we would surely encourage. 
I know many of those years when we 
were in the majority and bills would 
come to the floor that were appropria-
tions, a Member literally could write 
their amendment on a piece of paper 
and turn it in and that amendment 
would be debated and voted on, on the 
House floor. Sometimes, you would see 
over 100 amendments on a single appro-
priations bill, which are all important 
and should be debated, so we would go 
to 2-minute votes. 
The question I would have is, now 
that we have seen—from reports I have 
seen, and maybe you have too—that 
roughly 75 percent of all Members in 
this House have had a vaccination for 
COVID–19, there is a strong desire to 
get back to a regular floor schedule 
here on the floor, where we are con-
ducting our business and have the abil-
ity to interact with each other as col-
leagues. 
It is a much different experience than 
when people have to trickle in, trickle 
out, limiting the number of people, the 
ability to debate things, 45-minute 
votes for every bill. If you have 100 
amendments on a bill, this House can’t 
function at 45 minutes per vote. To get 
back to a 15-minute, 5-minute, and 2- 
minute voting schedule—again, CDC 
guidance just came out this week, say-
ing if someone is vaccinated, they 
don’t even have to have a mask to be 
around other people. 
The Senate doesn’t require masks on 
their floor. There is no reason why we 
would have to have a mask to have this 
conversation. The President of the 
United States doesn’t wear a mask 
when he is giving speeches, or his Press 
Secretary when she is meeting with the 
press. 
Can we get back to a regular floor op-
erating schedule where we can meet as 
colleagues in person? If somebody 
doesn’t want to be around others, 
maybe a voting station can be set up. 
But for anybody else who wants to 
interact following CDC guidance, rec-
ognizing the vaccination rate, and get-
ting back to the ability to have a vot-
ing schedule that allows us to conduct 
business the way we are going to need 
to when we start taking up those ap-
propriations bills, I would ask the gen-
tleman if he has a plan for that, if he 
could lay that out. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I would 
tell the gentleman that would cer-
tainly be the ideal. There is no doubt 
about that. We would like to get to 
that position. 
We continue to consult the Capitol 
physician on his advice on what we 
ought to be doing. It would be a lot 
simpler if every Member had been vac-
cinated, I will tell my friend. Although, 
obviously, the information as to who 
gets a vaccination and who does not is 
privileged and private information, as 
it should be, I would ask my friend to 
urge his Members to get the vaccina-
tion so that both sides will know that 
all of our Members have been vac-
cinated. That will facilitate getting to 
where the gentleman wants to get and 
where, I share his view, I want to get 
and the Speaker wants to get. So, we 
will continue to talk about that. 
Although we have a regular schedule, 
it is not the old schedule. It is not the 
15-minute vote or 17- or 20-minute vote 
that we had, which was much more ef-
ficient, as you may have seen me 
quoted in the paper the other day 
about virtual, that we prefer to come 
together in this Chamber, in com-
mittee rooms, on this campus, to dis-
cuss with one another, to work with 
one another. We think that is the ideal, 
and we hope to get there as soon as 
possible. 
We are making progress, obviously. 
We are getting a lot of Americans vac-
cinated. We are not anywhere close to 
the 75 percent yet, but, hopefully, we 
will be there soon. 
I would think and hope we could get 
to 100 percent of Members and make 
sure that our staff is vaccinated as 
well. The sooner we do that, the sooner 
we can accomplish what the gentleman 
wants to accomplish. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
hope the gentleman is not suggesting 
that it would take a 100 percent vac-
cination rate. I know with the rest of 
the country, when States make deci-
sions to reopen, when CDC issues guid-
ance, I have never seen any guidance 
that said 100 percent vaccination is the 
standard for bringing something back. 
Mr. HOYER. Would the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
would yield because I would suggest 
that if we are at 75 percent now, you 
also have Members who have anti-
bodies, who may have had COVID 
months ago and who have even taken 
the test that shows they have anti-
bodies. Whether they have taken the 
vaccine or not, the antibodies can fight 
off COVID. 
b 1245 
But at 75 percent, is there a number 
higher than that that the gentleman is 
setting as a standard? 
I would hope it wouldn’t be 100, but I 
would also hope we could have a con-
versation together to work through 
what that standard should be so we can 
get to a place where we have a normal 
operating process both in the House 
and in committees. 
The committee work being done vir-
tually is a true disservice to the ability 
for us to collegially work on issues. 
Many of our committees deal with not 
the high-profile issues that are the bat-
tleground issues where we are on our 
own sides, but in many cases it is 
where one sees the kind of collegiality 
where Congress can come together and 
work, and that isn’t happening either. 
I would hope we could come up with 
a standard that is not 100 percent. If we 
are at 75, then it has got to be some-
where at a different place to get back 
to a House floor functioning schedule, 
as well as a committee structure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Let me make a few comments. First 
of all, the gentleman mentioned about 
the White House and the President. I 
am going down with the President, who 
is going to sign the American Rescue 
Plan tomorrow, an extraordinary piece 
of legislation that we are very excited 
about and that is going to help lit-
erally millions and millions of Ameri-
cans and our entire economy, our fami-
lies, and our children. So we are very 
excited about that. 
I was required to have a test. Now, I 
have had two shots, but I was required 
to have a test this morning by the Cap-
itol physician before I went down to 
the White House. The gentleman says 
that you don’t wear a mask, but one 
has to have a test before one gets into 
the room. 
Now, with respect to the 100 percent, 
I think we ought to have 100 percent. I 
think everybody in this body and every 
one of our staff ought to have the vac-
cine to make sure that we are safe and 
that others who deal with us are safe. 
The CDC guidelines, by the way, rec-
ommend that people be vaccinated but 
that they avoid medium and large 
crowds. 
Now, depending upon what the gen-
tleman says, Madam Speaker, if you 
have 300 people on this floor, that is a 
reasonably good-sized crowd, and we 
are in great proximity to one another 
because of the size of this Chamber. 
The CDC also says—the Senate has 
not listened to the CDC. The CDC says 
wear masks. So in terms of the gentle-
man’s suggestion about the CDC chang-
ing its rules, that is true, but they 
haven’t changed their rule on masks. 
They say wear a mask and try not to 
congregate in large crowds. 
However, having said that, we want 
to get to the same objective that the 
gentleman references, and we are work-
ing towards that with the consider-
ation of the safety of our staff, the 
safety of our Members, and the safety 
of security folks. We hope to get there 
sooner rather than later, and we are 
working on it. 
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate the gen-
tleman’s offer to work. Obviously, 
when one looks at the way the Senate 
operates, they have said that to speak, 
especially, you don’t need to wear a 
mask. 
I don’t see the science that would say 
that the gentleman and I have to wear 
masks 
to 
have 
this 
conversation.

Again, I would direct my friend to 
when the President is giving a speech, 
he is not wearing a mask. If there are 
other people around, then they might 
be wearing a mask; but when they 
speak, they take off their mask. Just 
look at those protocols as well and just 
try to inject some of those common-
sense measures to try to get back to 
doing our job. 
One final point, I hope, again, we 
would all want everyone who has the 
interest in getting the vaccine to have 
access to the vaccine. But if one Mem-
ber out of 435 felt they didn’t want to 
have the vaccine, then I would hope 
that wouldn’t be enough to prohibit 
the rest of us from carrying out more 
normal functions on the House floor 
and in committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. My point on the White 
House was that a Member may decide 
that. And if they don’t want to get a 
test, then they can’t go to the White 
House, for the safety of everybody 
there. 
Mr. SCALISE. If maybe a require-
ment of a test once a week when we 
come in or something like that would 
help get us to a better place where we 
can have in-person, on the floor, and 
in-committee processes and meetings— 
the testing capability is now there in 
the Attending Physician’s office. If it 
needs to be widened more, I know there 
are other rooms that are doing some of 
the testing—then that would be a sug-
gestion, I think, worth us discussing if 
it helps us get back to a more func-
tioning Congress, especially a more 
functioning House on the floor and in 
committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, every-
body in America wants to get back to 
normal. Everybody in America. We 
agree with them, and we are hopeful 
that we will get there sooner rather 
than later, and we are making good 
progress. 
We just, yesterday, invested a large 
number, billions of dollars, to facili-
tate getting to where we want to be. 
And Americans want to be in testing, 
vaccination, and tracing. So I don’t 
want to have anybody think we are in 
disagreement. We want to get there. 
We want to get there safely. We want 
to get there consistent with good 
health practices and the advice of the 
scientists and the physicians who treat 
us. But we are talking about it as we 
were here this week, and we are going 
to be talking about it next week be-
cause we all want to get to the same 
place. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate that. 
Again, hopefully, this is a discussion 
that we can all have, not just the ma-
jority making this decision, but the 
majority working with the minority. 
We have an active group of Members 
who are medical doctors, the Doctors 
Caucus, who have a lot of good sugges-
tions. I think they are going to try to 
meet with the House Attending Physi-
cian. Hopefully, that can spur some ad-
ditional ideas about how we can do 
this, and then have us work together to 
achieve that. 
Finally, on the House committee 
schedule especially, we have taken up 
14 different rules bills this Congress so 
far, bills that have actually come to 
the floor under a rule. Unfortunately, 
only one of those bills actually went to 
committee. Meaning, 13 of the 14 bills 
never even went to committee to have 
the debate in the openness and the 
transparency that this Congress de-
serves. 
I think that millions of people across 
the country would expect that we 
would be having—as we are shaping 
policy, that it is not just a one-sided 
approach. That if a socialist agenda is 
being pushed by one side, then can’t 
the other side at least have that dis-
cussion in a committee process and 
offer amendments? 
The amendment process is critically 
important, and that has been lost too 
often—even the $1.9 trillion spending 
bill that over 90 percent of which had 
nothing to do with health needs and 
not a dime of which was dedicated to 
safely reopening schools, which is a 
huge cry amongst millions of parents 
across the country. 
Madam Speaker, not only on one 
side, but, frankly, nobody on the ma-
jority side was even allowed to offer an 
amendment. A $1.9 trillion spending 
bill, probably the largest bill that has 
come through Congress in the history 
of our country, and not a single amend-
ment, Democrat or Republican, was al-
lowed in the House on that bill to be 
brought forward. 
We were able to bring some amend-
ments in committee. Every one of 
them was voted down or removed. Not 
one Democrat that I saw was even al-
lowed to bring an amendment up in 
committee on a $1.9 trillion bill. 
That is a major concern. It is a con-
cern that denies the people’s House 
from being able to express the will of 
the people when we have ideas and sug-
gestions maybe, for example, as we 
wanted to in the House to say: Should 
a felon who is in a prison be able to get 
a $1,400 check? 
We weren’t even able to bring that 
amendment up for debate. 
Can we at least require that schools 
reopen? 
If hundreds of billions of new dollars 
are going to go to schools, shouldn’t 
the requirement be that they use that 
following the CDC guidance and fol-
lowing the science that is widespread 
that says the schools should be open 
and that long-term damage is being 
done to kids by not being in the class-
room? 
Millions and millions of kids—maybe 
over 60 percent of the children in 
America—are not getting daily in-the- 
classroom learning. Unions are more 
concerned, saying: You can go to 
spring break if you are a union mem-
ber, but just don’t post pictures be-
cause we don’t want anybody to see 
it—when they should be in the class-
room teaching our kids. 
That debate never got to happen here 
on the House floor and, frankly, in 
most of the committees. Because these 
bills aren’t going through committee. 
And that one bill went through com-
mittee with the order clearly given not 
to allow a single amendment. Not a 
single amendment in the House was 
added to a $1.9 trillion spending bill. 
I am sure some people might think 
that was the perfect bill, that there 
was not a single change. But some-
times the smallest bill has a change 
made that makes it a better bill, but 
not that bill. That kind of closed proc-
ess is not who we should be as a House. 
Madam Speaker, 13 out of 14 bills 
didn’t even go through committee, and 
the one that did—the $1.9 trillion bill— 
not a single amendment by a Repub-
lican or Democrat in the House was al-
lowed to be added. I hope that is not 
the standard. It is surely not reflective 
of what this House should be doing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. The gentleman was here 
in 2017, of course. There was a bill that 
approximated the size of this bill. It 
was about $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion. 
This is a little more—substantially a 
little more, $300 billion, $400 billion, 
but in the same ballpark. There were 
no hearings on that bill. There were no 
amendments on that bill. It came to 
the floor, and there were no amend-
ments to that bill. None. Zero. 
Now, of course, 83 percent of that bill 
went to the top 1 percent of Americans. 
This bill was just about the opposite; 85 
to 90 percent go to probably the bottom 
two-fifths in terms of income level and 
wealth. Hundreds of amendments were 
offered, as the committees marked up 
their instructions from the Budget 
Committee. Hundreds. 
Amendments were, of course, offered 
in the Senate, as well. As my friend 
knows, they had their vote-a-rama; 
they met for over 24 hours. To indicate 
that this bill did not have a robust 
committee process in which Repub-
licans 
and 
Democrats 
could 
offer 
amendments and have them adopted, I 
think, is not accurate, with all due re-
spect, Madam Speaker. 
Furthermore, this bill enjoyed the 
overwhelming support of the American 
people. Madam Speaker, 77 percent of 
Americans—59 percent of Republicans 
in the Morning Consult poll, 67 percent 
of Americans supporting the minimum 
wage, which was rejected, of course, by 
the parliamentarian in the Senate; 83 
percent of Americans supporting H.R. 
1, one of the bills that passed; 89 per-
cent supporting comprehensive back-
ground checks, which passed today; 72 
percent of Americans supporting equal 
protections for LGBTQ Americans. 
The point I am making is, A, the bill 
to which my friend refers, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, had very substantial 
consideration over days. 
The Ways and Means markup took 2 
days and many amendments offered. So

March 11, 2021 
from the standpoint of the public’s 
knowing what was going on, I would 
suggest to my friend that that was 
very much greater than when the tax 
bill—about the same—in the same 
range of, in that case, $1.5 trillion with 
interest approaching the $1.9 trillion. 
So we think, very frankly, that there 
has been a lot of discussion on that 
bill. 
One of the things, Madam Speaker, 
that concerned me the most was we 
worked in a bipartisan fashion on six 
prior bills. One passed on voice vote, 
the CARES Act, on the floor. Others 
passed with well over 150 Republicans 
and well over 150 Democrats—more 
than that, but well over 300 votes. They 
were all bipartisan. They were nego-
tiated with the administration—the 
Trump administration. The CARES 
Act, Madam Speaker, was about ex-
actly the same amount of dollars, and 
it passed on a voice vote here. 
What was the difference? 
Trump was President. That was the 
difference in all five. And it had been 
negotiated with him—or the Secretary 
of the Treasury, to be more accurate. 
But substantively there was very lit-
tle difference in terms of the broad na-
ture of their impact, the dollar value of 
the bills, and the diversity of their ob-
jectives. To that extent, they were 
very much like this bill. 
But, Madam Speaker, what was the 
difference? 
The same thing that was the dif-
ference when we did the Recovery Act 
in ‘09. The gentleman was here. He was 
elected in ‘08. He came here and he 
voted ‘‘no’’ on the Recovery Act. Every 
Republican voted ‘‘no’’ on the Recov-
ery Act—$787 billion. In my view, it 
kept us out of a depression. But that 
was 
not 
my 
view 
alone. 
It 
was 
Bernanke’s view and it was the Sec-
retary of the Treasury’s view. So we 
see the same thing happen again. We 
went from bipartisan to partisan votes. 
I, frankly, Madam Speaker, find it 
hard to believe that there wasn’t a sin-
gle Republican who thought the invest-
ments in opening up schools—some 
people say, well, you open up schools, 
that is the big cry now. 
Yes, and we are doing something 
about it. They weren’t open when we 
took over, but they are coming to be 
open. 
I think it is unfortunate, Madam 
Speaker, that some demean our teach-
ers. I will tell you, Madam Speaker, I 
have four great-grandchildren. All but 
one, who is too young, were taught vir-
tually for these many, many months. 
And my granddaughter, their moth-
er, raves about their commitment of 
the teachers to those three children, 
and the work that they put in, day 
after day after day. 
b 1300 
So are they concerned about their 
own safety? Are they concerned about 
the safety of the children? Are they 
concerned about other children and 
children taking it home to their moms 
and dads or their grandparents? They 
are. So we need to be safe. 
But this bill, which all our Repub-
lican friends voted against, has sub-
stantial billions in there to make the 
schools safe so that people can go back 
with the confidence that they will be 
safe. 
So I would simply say to my friend 
and others that they have talked about 
openness. In the 115th Congress—that 
is the last Congress in which there was 
a Republican majority—there was not 
a single open rule, not one. In the 115th 
Congress, you had 103 closed rules. In 
the last Congress, which we were in 
charge, we had that number to less 
than 52, 51. 
JIM MCGOVERN, the chairman of the 
Rules Committee, is very committed to 
trying to make amendments, including 
amendments on the Republican side, in 
order; and I have urged him to do that. 
So, hopefully, we will move forward 
in a way that continues to allow this 
House to operate effectively, and also 
give opportunity to your side and our 
side to raise issues. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, when 
you look at the bill that passed yester-
day, the only bipartisan vote was 
against the bill. Every Republican—in 
fact, a Democrat voted against it as 
well. You had two Democrats who 
voted against it originally when it 
came through the House the first time. 
But the bottom line is, it was the 
majority party and President Biden 
who chose to go it alone, who chose to 
have a closed process where Repub-
licans were shut out. 
There were many efforts, including a 
number of Senators going to the White 
House to meet with the President, who 
offered ideas, and every one of those 
ideas was thrown in the trash can. 
That is not a unity message. That is 
not trying to work with people from all 
parties and all walks of life to come up 
with the best ideas. 
It was a go-it-alone socialist agenda, 
very little focused on COVID; $1.9 tril-
lion, over 90 percent of which wasn’t 
dedicated to healthcare. 
You want to talk about schools. 
There was not a single dime in that bill 
that requires schools to reopen. You 
look at the money for schools, and 
hundreds of billions of dollars, by the 
way, are already out there that aren’t 
spent, hundreds of billions that we all 
worked on together. 
When President Trump said he want-
ed to work with Republicans and 
Democrats, 
he 
actually 
followed 
through on that promise, as the gen-
tleman noted, and every CARES Act 
bill was a very bipartisan bill. That 
was an effort made on both sides to 
work together and they were targeted. 
It was targeted on helping families who 
were struggling or helping small busi-
nesses who were struggling; on getting 
money into the search for a vaccine. 
Operation Warp Speed should be 
something we all celebrate, where 
President Trump said he wants to put 
all the focus at FDA on not only find-
ing a vaccine, but prefunding the man-
ufacturing of the vaccinations even be-
fore FDA approves them so we don’t 
have to wait an extra few months that 
we don’t have. That is why we are at a 
point where we can have 100 million 
vaccinations. We tried to double that 
number in this bill. That amendment 
was voted down. 
But on schools, my colleague, ASH-
LEY HINSON, had a bill to say, let’s say 
if the schools are going to get new 
money—which 
they 
already 
have 
enough money to fortify their schools 
to reopen safely. Many took us up on 
that and are open in the classroom 
today. Some have chosen not to, but 
not for a lack of money. Let’s be very 
clear about that. 
In fact, 95 percent of the money for 
schools in the bill that was passed yes-
terday can’t even be spent this year; 95 
percent of it. Then you have hundreds 
of billions of dollars still unspent that 
can be used to reopen schools who want 
to get back in the classroom, that 
money is already there. That money 
did not require—that need did not get 
met yesterday. That need was already 
met by Congress. 
Some chose to do it. Some have cho-
sen not to reopen, even though not 
only is the money there to reopen, but 
the science is there. The science lays 
out not only how to safely reopen, but 
it points out the devastating damage 
being done to children in this country 
by not reopening. 
So when the gentleman talks about 
polls and, well, the polling says this 
bill is really popular. Hey, do you want 
a check for $3,500? I am sure a lot of 
people would say yes, until they realize 
that $350 billion of this money goes to 
bail out failed States. And a State like 
California, who has a $10-plus-billion 
surplus, is going to get over $40 billion. 
So I am sure if we asked a poll ques-
tion to people across this country: Do 
you think it is right to borrow $1.9 tril-
lion from our children? Because some-
body is going to have to pay for this. 
This money didn’t fall out of the sky. 
Is it right to borrow $1.9 trillion from 
our children to give California $41 bil-
lion when they currently have a $10 bil-
lion surplus? I think we would get a 
different answer than the 70 percent 
saying yes. 
If you said, in this bill, which we 
tried to correct, every felon in prison 
today in America will get a $1,400 
check from the taxpayers. That is in 
the bill. 
They tried to take it out in the Sen-
ate when they allowed them on the 
floor to bring an amendment. Not a 
single amendment was allowed on this 
House floor to fix those kinds of dis-
parities. 
Every Democrat in the Senate voted 
‘‘no.’’ They said continue to give $1,400 
checks to prisoners, felons in prison, 
when we are already paying for their 
food, 
for 
their 
lodging, 
for 
their 
healthcare. Now they are going to get 
a $1,400 check from the taxpayers of 
this country, borrowed from our chil-
dren.

March 11, 2021 
Do most Americans know that? I 
hope they do because when we then ask 
them the question later: Now that you 
know what is really in the bill, what do 
you think about it? When you recog-
nize some of the other ideas that were 
brought forward, not only to reopen 
schools, but to target the money, to 
focus on helping small businesses, 
those were the things that we wanted 
to do, trying to put some guardrails 
and limitations in place, like the pre-
vious CARES Act bills did, which is 
why they were all bipartisan. 
But when you look at these expendi-
tures, and then you recognize that 
there is no money requiring schools to 
reopen. But our border is wide open 
right now and if someone comes over 
legally, they will get a check. That is 
a concern to a lot of people. 
So, yes, look at the bill. The Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, it did go through 
committee. It did have markups and 
hearings. And, in fact, it yielded a 
great benefit to every American. Every 
income group benefited from the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act. And, as the gen-
tleman knows, the income group level 
that benefited the most by us cutting 
taxes were the lowest income, because 
we rebuilt our middle class because of 
that bill. We made America competi-
tive because of that bill. 
And in this bill that passed yester-
day, with a bipartisan vote against it, 
there was tucked away language that 
prohibits States from cutting taxes. 
Explain what that has to do with 
COVID. 
If you are a State, every State will 
get money from that bill. Again, Cali-
fornia gets over $40 billion, even 
though they have a $10 billion surplus. 
But if a State tries to cut taxes, they 
actually get penalized in the bill. Peo-
ple are aghast when they hear that. It 
just came out yesterday. 
What does that have to do with 
COVID? 
Why wasn’t this a targeted relief 
bill? It was because one side wanted to 
close the process out and just go it 
alone and push a socialist agenda that 
has nothing to do, or little to do, with 
COVID relief. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t think there 
is a socialist agenda on this floor, any 
more than I think there is a fascist 
agenda on this floor. And we hear so-
cialist. When Gingrich was here it was 
liberals. Now it is socialists; trying to 
distract from substance, trying to in-
flame. 
It wasn’t socialists that stormed the 
Capitol, and they weren’t carrying 
Biden signs, they were carrying Trump 
signs. 
I am tired, Madam Speaker, of this 
socialist drivel. First of all, I think a 
lot of them don’t have the faintest idea 
what socialism is versus dictatorship 
or authoritarian regimes. 
And the schools weren’t reopened 
when we took over. Trump was Presi-
dent for 10 months. 
The gentleman apparently wants to 
say in this bill, open the schools no 
matter what. We don’t care what your 
locals say. We don’t care what your 
PTAs say. We don’t care what your su-
perintendents of schools say. Open the 
schools because we mandate it. 
I don’t think that is what the gen-
tleman, Madam Speaker, in the past 
has stood for, mandating what States 
do. Now maybe he thinks that we 
ought to take over the local education 
systems and tell them to open. We 
didn’t do that. 
What we did was, however, gave them 
$130 billion, over time—he is right, not 
immediately—over time to spend to 
make those schools safe; make their 
ventilation systems safe for kids; make 
the accommodations in the schools safe 
for kids and teachers and parents who 
go there. 
So, Madam Speaker, we get dis-
tracted by these assertions of some 
sort of ideological patina that reso-
nates with the right wing in America. 
And we can do that, or we can talk 
about substance. 
Yes, I mentioned Americans over-
whelmingly said that the substance 
that we had in this bill was what they 
liked. So, I would hope the Republican 
whip would talk about the substance of 
these bills. 
We can have differences. But over 
and over, in the newspapers and on this 
floor, the socialist agenda resonates in 
your polls. It resonates in some of the 
districts; we saw that. It was not true. 
Social Security was called socialist 
when it was adopted; Medicare, as well; 
Medicaid certainly, socialist, efforts to 
try to lift people up. 
And when the gentleman tries to 
make an analogy to a bill that sent 83 
percent of $1.5 trillion to the top 1 per-
cent in America as being a bill to help 
the middle class, and working Ameri-
cans, boy, that is a stretch, Madam 
Speaker. 
Now, I want to go back to the sub-
stance of what the gentleman has 
raised. We want to see us working to-
gether. I see my friend from Texas on 
the floor. He and I have had these dis-
cussions. 
It is a shame that we accuse one an-
other of this epithet or that epithet 
and try to put one another in a corner. 
I lived through the Gingrich era, and 
that was almost the entire rhetoric 
that I heard from the floor all the 
time. 
But if we are going to do that, it is 
going to be because people really do 
want to work in a bipartisan fashion. 
There was discussion—I know for a 
fact, I was here, and I saw President 
Obama try to work in a bipartisan 
fashion on the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act. Yes, he put his bill 
on the floor—excuse me—not on the 
floor, he put it on the table. 
And I heard the meetings at the 
White House. I heard the meetings here 
when the Republicans said: Well, he 
didn’t try to talk to us; he put this bill 
on the floor before he even talked to 
us. Not on the floor, on the table. I 
know because I was sitting there in the 
room when President Obama was try-
ing to reach bipartisan agreement. 
Zero Republicans, three in the Sen-
ate, helped on the American Recovery 
Act, which kept us out of depression. 
And I wasn’t surprised that we had zero 
on this reconciliation bill, and I wasn’t 
surprised that it changed from the six 
votes previously, where Donald Trump 
said this bill is okay; I am going to 
sign it; because nothing could have be-
come law without him signing it. And 
Republicans voted overwhelmingly, in 
most cases, for it. 
But now that we have a Democratic 
President, they have decided to return 
to the ‘‘no’’ votes that they cast on the 
Recovery Act, on the Affordable Care 
Act, which has helped millions and mil-
lions of people, and so many other 
pieces of legislation. 
I would urge, my friend, Madam 
Speaker, to, when we say we want to 
work in a bipartisan way, let’s try to 
do it. It is worth doing. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, it is 
worth doing. Again, that is why you 
had a number of Republican Senators 
go to the White House to offer that 
olive branch. They were turned down, 
and that is unfortunate. 
On this bill, clearly it wasn’t just Re-
publicans who voted against it. It was 
a bipartisan vote in opposition. I hope 
that is not the model. And that was the 
point. 
Thirteen of 14 bills have come to the 
floor under a rule so far; didn’t even go 
through committee. Let’s get back to 
that collegiality. Let’s get back to 
bringing bills to committee, having the 
committees actually work in person so 
Members can have the ability to have 
those conversations and come and find 
common ground, which has happened 
in the past, and it surely can happen 
again now. I hope we can get to that 
point soon. 
I yield to the gentleman to add any-
thing else. 
Mr. HOYER. I have nothing to fur-
ther to say, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

NEVER STOP SAYING HER NAME 
(Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, 1 
year ago this Saturday, a young couple 
in my hometown of Louisville were in 
bed when their door was broken down. 
The terrified couple leaped for cover, 
and the man, a licensed gun owner, 
fired a single shot toward the men 
busting into his home, hitting one in 
the leg. 
The intruders responded with a bar-
rage of gunfire so wild that it not only 
killed the woman but narrowly missed 
a 5-year-old in another apartment. 
There is no mystery about the kill-
ers’ identities, yet they remain free.

That this is unjust, tragic, and an 
abomination should be beyond debate. 
Instead, it is hardly unique in America 
for two reasons, because the killers 
wore badges and their victims were 
Black. 
One year later, we are still demand-
ing justice for Breonna Taylor, for her 
grieving friends and family and aching 
community and country. 
Until this horrific story stops repeat-
ing, until we can say that, in America’s 
policing and justice system, Black 
lives truly matter, we will not stop 
fighting; we will never stop demanding 
justice for Breonna; and we will never

POPE FRANCIS’ TRIP TO IRAQ 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to share the most important 
news of the past few days, which was 
not Oprah’s interview with the Duke 
and Duchess. In fact, it was Pope 
Francis’ historic trip to Iraq and his 
extraordinary 
meeting 
with 
Grand 
Ayatollah al-Sistani. 
Greeted by a release of white doves, 
Pope Francis, age 84, and the Grand 
Ayatollah, age 90, met for nearly an 
hour at the Grand Ayatollah’s simple 
home in the city of Najaf. Together, 
they reinforced the Pope’s and Islamic 
leaders’ renewed formal and joint com-
mitment to human fraternity. 
The Grand Ayatollah reinforced his 
belief that ‘‘Christian citizens should 
live, like all Iraqis, in peace and secu-
rity and with their full constitutional 
rights.’’ 
In the aftermath of the undisputed 
victory by the Iraqi, United States, and 
allied forces over the murderous ca-
liphate of ISIS, the Pope’s visit gives 
validation to the future of Iraq and its 
historic cultural and geographic roots 
of the three Abrahamic religions. 
To the people of Iraq, we American 
citizens pray for safety, prosperity, and 
peace for you and your families.

YOUNG AMERICANS CHANGED 
CONVERSATION ON GUN VIOLENCE 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, today, the House passed H.R. 
8 and H.R. 1446, two bills to enhance 
background checks and promote gun 
violence prevention. 
As a millennial, I am a member of 
what is known as the Columbine gen-
eration, a generation that grew up in 
the shadow of gun violence and school 
shootings. 
When violence came to our Capitol 
on January 6, congressional staffers 
barricaded themselves into a con-
ference room and hid under furniture 
because it is what they learned to do in 
years of active-shooter drills. 
It is time for that to change, and this 
is the start. Today, I rise to honor the 
young people who called us here to act. 
From Steele Canyon to Bonita Vista, 
students in San Diego have organized, 
protested, and marched for their lives. 
I have been so inspired by them and 
young Americans across the country 
who have fundamentally changed the 
conversation on gun violence. 
Because of their activism, we finally 
passed commonsense legislation that 
will save so many lives. 
I was proud to support these bills.

CONGRATULATING WICHITA STATE 
UNIVERSITY MEN’S BASKETBALL 
TEAM 
(Mr. ESTES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Wichita 
State 
University 
men’s 
basketball 
team and their head coach, Isaac 
Brown, for winning the America Ath-
letic Conference regular-season cham-
pionship. This is the Shockers’ first 
AAC championship after joining the 
conference in the 2017–2018 season. 
The Shockers ended their regular 
season with an overall 15–4 record after 
ranking seventh in the AAC preseason 
poll. WSU now enters postseason play 
as the No. 1 seed. 
I am so proud of these men who have 
displayed perseverance on the court 
during this challenging year, and I 
know they will continue to make Wich-
ita and Kansas proud. 
I wish them the best of luck as they 
compete this weekend in Texas during 
the AAC men’s basketball tournament. 
Go Shox.

GREEN-LIGHTING A BORDER 
CRISIS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
after good results and success in recent 
years of defending and controlling our 
border, the Biden administration has 
turned on the green light that is seen 
all the way to Central America for im-
migrating here illegally, giving us the 
Biden border crisis. 
It is not a matter of asylum, as asy-
lum can be sought in Mexico. Con-
tinuing the trek to the U.S. border 
shows it is really about employment 
and economics. 
Meanwhile, as our citizens struggle 
with unemployment and the shutdowns 
from COVID, the Biden border crisis 
has subjected border States, like my 
State of California, to COVID outbreak 
risks from those bypassing our laws. 
This begs the question: Whose side is 
the Biden administration on, America’s 
unemployed and COVID high-risk vul-
nerable or foreign interests for poli-
tics? 
Indeed, it doesn’t seem like they are 
on the side of Americans, and we are 
given, after less than 2 months, the 
Biden border crisis.

BORDER CRISIS IS A DANGER TO 
AMERICANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to follow up on the remarks of 
my friend from California, who just 
noted the crisis we have at the border 
and the danger that that puts the 
American people in, and not just the 
American people, but the immigrants 
who seek to come here. 
I rise today, in particular, to bring 
the public’s attention to that border 
crisis, which my friend rightfully rec-
ognized is being driven by that guy 
who runs that outfit over there. 
Now, I do not mean, in saying that, 
the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin. 
I know who he is. I mean that other 
guy who runs that outfit over there, 
down Pennsylvania Avenue, and that is 
the President of the United States. 
I say this because the President can-
not possibly have any idea what is 
going on because no American Presi-
dent entrusted with the safety and 
well-being of the United States and her 
citizens would purposely empower car-
tels or would purposely empower ille-
gal organizations to harm American 
citizens for profit, to flood our streets 
with dangerous fentanyl and narcotics, 
to cause high-speed chases like the 
ones that have occurred in the district 
I represent, where Americans are in 
danger, or the murder of Americans 
through wide-open borders. No Amer-
ican President would purposely do 
that, would they? 
No American President would pur-
posely lie to immigrants and cause 
them to get raped and abused on long, 
dangerous journeys across the desert, 
upon the promise of amnesty, for crass 
political purposes. No American Presi-
dent would possibly do that, would he 
or she? 
No American President could be so 
callous, so indifferent to the lives of 
Americans and immigrants who seek to 
come here, that he would allow his 
staff and the Secretary of Homeland 
Security to lie, repeatedly, to the 
American people that there is no crisis 
at our border. 
No American President would do 
that, so no American President could 
know that this is happening and take 
that position, could understand what is 
happening and then ignore it, could un-
derstand what is happening at the bor-
der and then deny it and encourage it 
through reckless policies. 
No, that guy who runs that outfit 
over there cannot possibly know what 
is happening at our border because no 
American President would do that. 
But I assure you, we Texans know; 
our neighbors in other border States

know; and the American people across 
the country affected by this crisis 
know. We see it every day, the brutal 
conditions along the border ravaged by 
the deceit and the lies of politicians 
governing by sound bite and pretending 
they are compassionate. We do see it 
every day. 
Who is this that I am showing here 
on the floor of the United States House 
of Representatives? This is the Vargas 
family. I have come to know Lori, and 
I have come to know other members of 
this family because Jared, depicted in 
this picture, was murdered by a col-
league at a restaurant who was in this 
country illegally, who had been caught, 
let go, caught, let go, caught again, let 
go, and then murdered Jared. He was 
from San Antonio, Texas, which I rep-
resent. 
This is real. This happens every day. 
We, in Texas, are on the front lines 
while the people in this body fiddle, 
and endanger the lives of American 
citizens, to prostrate themselves to a 
crass political left that could care less 
about the American citizens getting 
killed or raped. And they do it for po-
litical purposes. 
The arrogance of leftist Democrats 
destroying our own Nation with tril-
lions of dollars of spending; the reck-
less disregard of our energy independ-
ence and strength; the reckless dis-
regard of the small businesses getting 
destroyed by shutdowns and the liveli-
hoods destroyed while peddling fear 
and panic; the reckless disregard of our 
children, as their futures are destroyed 
by teachers’ unions and the dev-
astating masking of their innocent 
faces; the reckless disregard of our fun-
damental inalienable rights to worship, 
to speak freely, to defend ourselves 
with firearms, to pursue happiness by 
working to provide for our families; the 
reckless disregard for our safety while 
defunding police and attacking our 
rights to defend ourselves under the 
Second Amendment at the same time, 
done on this floor today; the reckless 
disregard for our national security, 
while empowering China to undermine 
our way of life; the reckless disregard 
for public health, as we rejoin the very 
World Health Organization that lied to 
us to protect China. 
But perhaps the most reckless, by my 
leftist Democratic colleagues, is the 
arrogance of using crass political self-
ishness to encourage parents to send 
their children to be raped, to be 
abused, to ride on train cars, and even 
to die along dangerous journeys, while 
simultaneously facilitating or encour-
aging the destruction of our neighbors 
to the south, in Mexico, Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Honduras. It is happening in 
real time and in extraordinary arro-
gance, for purposes of crass political 
gain or perceived gain. 
Our neighbors to the south lament 
the mass exodus of their people under 
the lies and false compassion being 
sold from American Democrats. 
b 1330 
This is the truth of what we are deal-
ing with. 
Let’s talk about some of the real 
issues going on on our border. Uvalde, 
Texas, the mayor, Don McLaughlin 
said, ‘‘The 2019 border crisis will look 
like a cakewalk to what is coming with 
Biden’s border crisis.’’ 
He said they are seeing 10 to 12 high- 
speed chases each week, with speeds up 
to 105 miles an hour. The local govern-
ment has to take it on the chin because 
this administration refuses to secure 
the border. That is the mayor in 
Uvalde, Texas, just outside of the dis-
trict 
I 
represent. 
My 
friend, 
Mr. 
GONZALES, represents that district. 
Don calls me all the time saying, 
‘‘Where’s the help?’’ 
Where is the Federal Government, 
whose job it is to secure the border of 
the United States? You know where it 
is? 
Nowhere to be found. In fact, actu-
ally found at a border making it worse 
for the citizens of this country, making 
it more dangerous, purposely or incom-
petently, either one unacceptably en-
dangering the lives of Americans and 
the immigrants who seek to come here. 
Del Rio mayor Bruno Lozano said, ‘‘I 
am pleading and requesting you to 
please put a halt to any measures re-
garding the release of immigrants 
awaiting court dates into the city of 
Del Rio and surrounding areas.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple are pleading with their leadership. 
They are begging for the people in this 
body, the people’s House, to recognize 
what is happening to them. 
It is real. People bury their head in 
the sand up here protected by fences 
with 
razor 
wire, 
walking 
through 
magnetometers, tweeting out how they 
somehow compare or have compassion 
for immigrants, ‘‘Look at us.’’ And in 
this photo is what is happening to im-
migrants in south Texas. 
There are mass graves where cartels 
kill people along the Rio Grande. There 
are people dying in the desert, seeking 
to come here like any normal person 
would do around the world, seeking to 
come to the United States of America, 
but being fed irrational hope from an 
administration for political purposes, 
endangering lives of immigrants and 
American citizens. 
Yuma, Arizona, mayor Douglas Nich-
ols said, ‘‘I am urging the Federal level 
for additional resources for United 
States Customs and Border, the need 
for more space at migrant holding fa-
cilities that will allow for adherence to 
CDC guidelines, more COVID testing. 
There is no capacity in our current 
nonprofit system in Yuma.’’ 
Our colleague, my friend from Texas, 
Mr. CUELLAR, has said thousands of mi-
grants have not been tested. Over 10,000 
people have come in through the lower 
Rio Grande Valley. He said, ‘‘Those 
folks aren’t being tested.’’ 
There are folks—my friends on the 
other side of the aisle who recognize 
what is happening. 
My colleague, Mr. GONZALES, sent a 
letter to Biden, requesting a meeting, 
stating, ‘‘It is imperative we get this 
situation under control or we are look-
ing at another crisis on our hands.’’ 
Well, that crisis is here, citing the 
large number of unaccompanied chil-
dren and increased hospital admissions. 
This is happening right now. 
Where is the President? Where is the 
Homeland Security Secretary? Where 
is anyone in this administration recog-
nizing the crisis at our border, the 
death toll, the impact on citizens and 
immigrants who seek to come here? 
Texas State senator, Chuy Hinojosa, 
Democrat, said, ‘‘I don’t think, quite 
frankly, the Biden administration was 
aware of what is happening on the 
ground here, which you can understand 
because they are just coming in and 
trying to get people up to speed with 
what is happening. But I don’t think 
they were aware there were that many 
coming across. The Border Patrol is 
overwhelmed. They are throwing their 
hands up because they don’t know what 
to do.’’ 
That is all from my Democrat friend 
from Texas. 
The CBP has already encountered 
nearly 400,000 illegal immigrants since 
October, and the numbers are rising. 
For contacts in the first 5 months of 
fiscal 
2020, 
the 
CBP 
encountered 
200,000. That is twice as many this 
year, twice as many. 
What changed? 
The administration’s absurd, embar-
rassing, incompetent or, worse yet, 
purposefully malicious policies. 
Just last month, February, the CBP 
encountered over 100,000 aliens at the 
border. One month. That is who they 
encountered. That is not got-aways. 
This is real. 
Come do like I have done and go 
spend the night on the border. Go sit 
down at the river at the Rio Grande. 
Talk to the immigrants, in my case in 
broken Spanish. If you are fluent, talk 
to them or have somebody who can and 
talk to them about why they are com-
ing. Talk to them about what the car-
tels are doing to them. 
Have a conversation with a young 
man, like I did last year, about the 
pack of girls behind him, about wheth-
er they were abused on the journey. He 
said, ‘‘Yes,’’ ‘‘Si.’’ 
Or just continue to bury one’s head 
in the sand and pretend it is compas-
sionate to have open borders, because 
that is what is happening today in the 
people’s 
House. 
These 
are 
human 
beings, y’all. 
As of last month, the number of fam-
ilies encountered is the highest since 
January 2019. In January, 7,200—almost 
7,300 family units were encountered. In 
February, that number skyrocketed to 
19,246. That is not an accident. These 
are families. 
Encounters with what we call UACs— 
unaccompanied 
alien 
children—in-
creased 74 percent year to date. Just 
last month, some 6,000 migrants aged 
16 and 17 were caught. The Department

of 
Homeland 
Security 
currently 
projects there will be 117,000 unaccom-
panied child migrants crossing the bor-
der this year. 
The number of migrant children is on 
pace to exceed the all-time record by 45 
percent, and the administration does 
not have enough beds. The Biden ad-
ministration needs another 20,000 beds 
to shelter the minors. 
Now, I have a couple friends here, a 
couple colleagues, who I think are 
waiting to join. 
Is the gentleman from California 
looking to add a few remarks? 
I will yield to the gentleman from 
California in just one minute, and then 
my friend from Virginia after him. 
But what I would say, when we are 
talking about these numbers, people 
get lost in the numbers, 20,000 beds, 
talking about 45 percent increase. Let’s 
just be very clear. For those of us who 
spend time on the border—I am going 
back on Monday—these are human 
beings. These are people. They are not 
political pawns. And that goes for 
American citizens and for the immi-
grants who seek to come here. 
And this is the dirty little secret. My 
Democratic colleagues know full well 
that what is happening at the border is 
going to be a catch-and-release organi-
zation. The Department of Homeland 
Security is turning the CBP into a 
catch-and-release organization. So you 
will see some of these numbers going 
down. 
But don’t kid yourself, the American 
people watching this. When the num-
bers go down in these facilities, it is 
because the Biden administration is 
purposefully catching and releasing 
folks, whether they have been tested or 
not, regardless of what kind of security 
threat they might pose, regardless of 
fully checking whether a child goes 
with a family member or not, whether 
they can be abused, put into the sex 
trafficking trade, because it is rote in-
competence. When you see those num-
bers go down, just know what is hap-
pening. 
11,000 people were caught and re-
leased in January and February, imme-
diately caught and released from the 
CBP rather than being put in facilities. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. 
ROY. 
Indeed, as another representative of a 
border state, we feel the effect as well 
of the Biden border crisis. President 
Trump saw the importance, as did 
many law-and-order Americans, of hav-
ing a secure border. The Biden adminis-
tration stopped construction of the se-
curity fence hours after being inaugu-
rated. This has given us now the Biden 
border crisis. 
Really bad enforcement of immigra-
tion, that seems to be their priority. 
Risking health of Americans with virus 
superspreaders is a result. As my col-
league mentioned, the catch-and-re-
lease program is in full force. 
Do we really expect people to be re-
leased in this country to come back to 
have a hearing within 2 years? 
Past pattern shows not. 
The Biden administration has just 
canceled an agreement with Mexico to 
keep the asylum seekers on that side of 
the border, which worked pretty well 
to keep the numbers down from those 
coming through Mexico from Central 
America. Now the incentivization of 
that is another big green light. 
Look at the numbers we are talking 
about here. Just in January, the num-
bers increased to 78,000 and change. In 
February, 100,000 so-called encounters 
at the border for people who our per-
sonnel have to deal with or might be 
sneaking through without dealing with 
our personnel. 
To add final insult to this policy, to 
Americans, to taxpayers, in the so- 
called COVID relief bill, checks can go 
to illegal immigrants who are coming 
here via this manner. 
I mean, whose side is this adminis-
tration on? The hardworking Ameri-
cans coming through a COVID crisis, 
high unemployment? Who are they 
working for? 
I don’t think it is us. I don’t think it 
is the American people. 
As a Californian, I also want to hark-
en back to two tragedies amongst 
many. In northern California, just a 
few short years ago, we lost a beautiful 
young lady named Kate Steinle in San 
Francisco, who was killed by an illegal 
immigrant who shouldn’t have been 
here, who should have been deported at 
least five times over. 
Jamiel Shaw from the Los Angeles 
area, whose father I have met. His dad 
lost his son to a killing by an illegal 
immigrant. 
Whose side is this administration on 
when they carry out this policy just to 
either show they are different from 
Trump or that it is a political gain for 
them in their twisted view? 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league for yielding. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his remarks. He 
rightfully points out the impact on 
Miss Steinle and her family and Amer-
ican citizens in California being nega-
tively impacted by illegal immigra-
tion. 
I talked before about Jared Vargas 
from San Antonio, the city I represent, 
who was murdered a couple years ago. 
His twin brother just graduated from 
college. He is going on. His family is a 
beautiful family. They have a strong 
faith, and they are persevering, but 
their family was turned upside down by 
a brutal murder. He was beaten to 
death and burned. Beaten to death and 
burned by a guy who came here ille-
gally, was caught and let go, caught 
and let go, caught and let go again. He 
beat and burned to death Jared Vargas. 
These are real people. We can do hun-
dreds of these. We can talk to the angel 
families who have lost loved ones. We 
can talk to the parents of law enforce-
ment officers and others in Border Pa-
trol who have lost loved ones along our 
border. We could do a whole hour, we 
could do a whole day just going 
through that impact and, as I pointed 
out before in the other slide, the im-
pact on the immigrants who seek to 
come here. 
This is the story, all in the false 
name of compassion by this adminis-
tration. 
I will be happy to yield in just 1 
minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia. 
My friend from California was raising 
the important points of the impact of 
illegal immigration. Now we are seeing 
it in real time, particularly in Texas, 
among all four States along the border 
and throughout this country, empow-
ering cartels, endangering the lives of 
the immigrants who seek to come here, 
endangering American citizens for one 
reason and one reason only, and that is 
the crass political interests of the 
American Democratic Party and this 
administration. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the esteemed congressman 
from Texas, who has been quite a 
champion on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, no nation in the his-
tory of the world has been more wel-
coming to immigrants than the United 
States. And no nation in the history of 
the world is more diverse or has pro-
vided more opportunity for people of 
all races and ethnic backgrounds than 
the United States. 
That is why millions of immigrants 
of all races and ethnicities are seeking 
to come to America. In fact, billions of 
the world’s 7 billion non-U.S. popu-
lation would come here, undoubtedly, 
if they could. 
I sincerely believe that most Ameri-
cans, if not most elected officials, un-
derstand that the lack of an effective 
immigration policy is one of the most 
important threats to our country. How-
ever, President Biden’s decision to re-
verse the Trump policies that success-
fully secured our border is dangerous 
to the future of our Nation and driven 
solely by a need to pander to the left. 
b 1345 
Make no mistake, President Biden’s 
policies created this very crisis today, 
his promise of amnesty made it worse, 
and his administration is now ignoring 
it. 
You would think in the absence of 
leadership, Congress would try to step 
in and address the Biden border surge 
crisis. 
Instead, we are expecting to take up 
two liberal amnesty bills in the House 
this upcoming week, including H.R. 6, 
the American Dream and Promise Act. 
H.R. 6 would provide amnesty to 
roughly three million people, which 
would be a slap in the face to everyone 
who ever has or currently is navigating 
our legal immigration system. 
Even worse, it would incentivize 
more illegal immigration at a time

March 11, 2021 
when we have no operational control of 
our southern border. 
Even more bizarre, this bill allows 
for criminal aliens, people who have 
committed crimes in American com-
munities, to be eligible for amnesty. 
The bill specifically allows for an in-
dividual who has committed up to two 
misdemeanors or one crime of moral 
turpitude to gain a pathway to legal 
status. 
Some may say, well, misdemeanors 
aren’t that serious. Well, here are a few 
examples of crimes that are only mis-
demeanors in States such as California: 
Domestic violence, prostitution, drunk 
driving. 
Worst of all, this legislation provides 
a waiver for people who would tech-
nically not otherwise qualify for this 
amnesty. This waiver specifically cov-
ers: Human smuggling offenses, voter 
fraud offenses, and communicable dis-
eases. 
I urge this Congress not to worsen 
this crisis, and to instead debate legis-
lation that makes America safer and 
honors our legal immigrants. 
Instead of providing amnesty to 
criminals, we should debate my legisla-
tion, H.R. 398, the No Asylum for 
Criminals Act, which would prohibit 
dangerous criminals from qualifying 
for asylum in the U.S. 
When it comes to legal immigration, 
people of good faith can debate on what 
overall immigration levels are prudent 
for our country, how to best balance 
the needs of American citizens with the 
desire of immigrants who are simply 
seeking a better life for themselves and 
their family, how to cultivate patriotic 
assimilation, how to protect jobs for 
American 
workers 
while 
providing 
labor for our businesses, and the mer-
its, or the lack thereof, of issues such 
as chain migration, birthright citizen-
ship, diversity visas, and other unique 
features of America’s immigration sys-
tem. 
But there should be no debate on the 
rule of law. We should be united and bi-
partisan on the critical importance of 
enforcing our laws and eliminating il-
legal immigration. 
There is simply no honest debate re-
garding the fact that barriers, whether 
walls or fences, work. Just look around 
D.C. to see confirmation that our 
House Democratic leadership believes 
this. 
There should be no debate regarding 
the fact that illegal immigration is a 
significant threat to our national secu-
rity, our economic security, and our 
health security. 
Illegal immigration further burdens 
our economy, our social services, our 
healthcare system, and our education 
system. 
Illegal immigration also enriches 
Mexico’s organized crime and the car-
tels that control everyone and every-
thing that comes across the southern 
border. 
The 
individuals 
illegally 
coming 
across our southern border suffer dan-
gerous and sometimes deadly hardships 
and are often victimized by the Mexi-
can cartels. 
Individuals who cannot afford to pay 
the smugglers are often extorted into 
carrying drugs and other illicit mate-
rial into the U.S. Others are abused as 
indentured servants to the cartels if 
they make it across. Many must live 
the rest of their lives with existential 
threats to themselves and their fami-
lies. 
Moreover, illegal immigration places 
our law enforcement and our citizens 
living near the border in immediate 
danger when drugs and other prevent-
able materials are smuggled across the 
border with impunity. We are risking 
turning every community into a border 
town and making our Nation a sanc-
tuary Nation. 
We must commit to completing the 
wall, enforcing our existing laws, end-
ing catch and release, requiring manda-
tory E-Verify, fixing our biometric 
entry/exit systems, and taking am-
nesty, unlawful employment, and citi-
zenship off the table. 
The future of our country is clearly 
at stake with how we manage or don’t 
manage immigration. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, in a mo-
ment I will yield to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia, and I thank the gen-
tleman from Virginia for those re-
marks that are directly on point. 
What we are seeing right now—you 
used the phrase that we are creating a 
‘‘sanctuary Nation,’’ is a sanctuary 
country. Well, that is what is hap-
pening. That is what this administra-
tion is doing. You talk about sanctuary 
cities; this administration is just going 
right past sanctuary cities, and they 
want to make the United States of 
America a sanctuary Nation. 
They are turning the Department of 
Homeland Security and the CBP into 
the welcoming center for a sanctuary 
Nation. And not a welcoming center in 
the sense that we would all agree we 
want to do as Americans, to make sure 
that those who are truly seeking refuge 
following our laws, seeking asylum, the 
things that our laws provide for people 
truly under persecution. No. They are 
using that as an excuse and cover for 
wide-open 
borders 
and, 
essentially, 
people seeking economic opportunity, 
which no one I know begrudges those 
who seek economic opportunity. But 
we do take issue with those who seek 
to violate our laws to come here, over-
whelm our border, and an administra-
tion whose job it is to enforce the laws 
of the United States to refuse to do so. 
It begs the question whether the 
President of the United States, as I 
said before, either has no idea what is 
happening at the border or whether it 
is purposeful. And if it is purposeful, is 
it the President of the United States 
choosing to refuse to defend the Con-
stitution and the laws and to refuse to 
take care to see that the laws of the 
United States are faithfully executed 
as is required under the Constitution of 
the United States? I think it is a ques-
tion this body ought to be asking. 
The people’s House ought to be ask-
ing: Is the President of the United 
States refusing to take care to ensure 
that the laws of the United States with 
respect to our borders are being faith-
fully executed? 
I would posit that that is precisely 
what is happening, or the President of 
the United States has no idea what is 
happening at our border. Because, 
again, no American President can be so 
callous as to use raw, crass politics to 
allow what is happening at our border 
to happen to human beings, American 
citizens and immigrants alike. ‘‘That 
guy who runs that outfit over there.’’ 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the good gentleman 
from Texas for yielding. 
I have to tell you, that Jared, who 
you spoke about, I met his aunt and 
uncle a few years ago. And he suffered 
a death that is too much to think 
about. And him being an American cit-
izen, born here free and being murdered 
like he was by illegal aliens, criminals, 
animals, is just too much to bear. 
This is the people’s House. This is the 
House of Representatives that I have 
started to call the house of hypocrites. 
This entire campus right now is sur-
rounded by a border wall with razor 
wire. It is a fence unlike anything at 
our southern border. This place is sur-
rounded by the military. It is com-
pletely guarded. But we don’t extend 
the same thing to the American people. 
The Joe Biden administration, my 
Democratic colleagues here in Con-
gress, Democrats in the Senate, they 
want the border ripped wide open, and 
that is what it is right now. 
I just watched a video that was 
shared this morning from southeast 
Texas where there are hundreds, per-
haps thousands of people lined up to 
cross the Rio Grande, and they are 
being smuggled into our country by 
human traffickers. 
It is big business to come into our 
country illegally, and Joe Biden is re-
warding the smugglers, the coyotes, 
the cartels in Mexico and these other 
countries by opening our borders up 
and welcoming them all in. 
While they are forcing our kids to 
stay home and paying off these teach-
ers’ union bosses, they have wide-open, 
100 percent capacity, in-person teach-
ing for illegal children. What kind of 
country is this that rewards people 
that break into our country illegally, 
but yet abuses its citizens and tax-
payers? 
There needs to be a change, and this 
is Joe Biden’s crisis that he will never 
recover from. People are not stupid, no 
matter if they vote one party or the 
other. But the American people are 
going to be sick and tired of being run 
over and treated this way. 
Everybody 
wants 
to 
cry 
about 
COVID–19, the most politicized virus, a 
political tool that shut down America. 
Well, let me tell you something, all 
these people that I just watched on this

video, they are not wearing masks like 
we are required to do. They are bring-
ing all kinds of diseases into our coun-
try, but yet, they are being welcomed 
in. Here, come to school. Here, here is 
a bus ride to another city. Come on in. 
Yet America is still not fully open be-
cause of COVID–19. 
There are so many reasons why we 
can call this the house of hypocrites 
that we could be here all day long, but 
I appreciate the time. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman from Georgia 
coming down and joining us in this 
conversation. 
I did not realize that the gentle-
woman had the pleasure of meeting 
with and getting to know the Vargas 
family or at least maybe the aunt and 
uncle, I think is what you said. And 
what I would tell you is that it is a 
truly wonderful family. They embody 
all that is right and good about the 
American Dream, about opportunity. 
These are American citizens, Amer-
ican citizens who happen to have, you 
know, Hispanic family members, which 
is so ironic because—you know, those 
of us who really try to take and honor 
the idea of judging people by the con-
tent of their character and not their 
skin color or race or creed, I find it 
ironic that my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle seem to only view the 
purpose of the legislative body to view 
human beings by the color of their skin 
and to make all of our policies based on 
segmenting us out. 
To quote the Supreme Court Justice 
John Roberts in a seminal Supreme 
Court case, Divvying us up by race is a 
sordid business. 
And my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle often use words like ‘‘voter 
suppression’’ when we talk about be-
lieving we should have voter identifica-
tion. Believing we should have rules in 
place about how we run our election 
systems, heaven forbid. 
And would the gentlewoman agree 
that too often those words like ‘‘voter 
suppression’’ are code words, buzz 
words for the allegation that those of 
us who believe a secure border is better 
for immigrants and American citizens 
believe that voter ID and systems that 
make sure American citizens are the 
ones voting that we are labeled bigots, 
and that words like ‘‘voter suppres-
sion’’ are code words and buzz words, 
dog whistles that we are bigots and 
that the agenda of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle is often di-
rected to label us as such. Would the 
gentlewoman agree with that? 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. ROY. I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. I definitely 
agree with the good gentleman from 
Texas. You see, it is unfortunate that 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle use race as a tool to push their 
agenda, where here in this country 
every single one of us are equal. God 
created us equal and thank God we 
have a Constitution that affirms it. 
And if we are to do anything we 
should look at Americans as one, be-
cause we are the citizens of this Na-
tion, and all of our policies and laws 
should serve our American people, not 
divide it up by identity or politics or 
any other category. 
And it is shameful that we have come 
to this place after we have come so far 
and achieved so much. And so, yes, I do 
agree with you, and it needs to be done 
away with. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, a brief 
moment, a side-step away from the 
issue of border security—and I know 
the gentleman is here and is waiting 
patiently—and I would just ask one 
more question. 
The gentlewoman was here on Mon-
day when we let it be known our desire 
to not allow 13 bills—10 Democratic 
bills, 3 Republican bills—to move off of 
the House floor by voice vote, that is 
without a roll call vote. And you would 
have thought that we, you know, lit a 
match on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives or had done something ex-
traordinary to just break this hallowed 
institution from its smooth operations 
of today. 
You would think that we were, you 
know, up-ending our Constitution as 
we know it because, believe it or not, 
we demanded the yeas and nays, a roll 
call vote, on 13 bills. The gentlewoman 
has also often taken to using motions 
to adjourn—and I believe I have heard 
she has done so and the gentlewoman 
stipulates she has done so—to force an-
other hour of consideration when we 
have a bill like the $1.9 trillion mon-
strosity that reshapes the American 
economy, 
reshapes 
the 
American 
healthcare system, funds money for 
people in prison, up-ends our entire fis-
cal stability, I could go on and on. 
Is the gentlewoman in agreement 
with me that what we are trying to do 
is to simply put our colleagues on no-
tice that perhaps the people’s House 
should debate, vote, amend, be present, 
not vote by proxy from your home dis-
tricts, actually be here, not have fences 
with razor wire, actually do our job, 
actually represent the people that elect 
us to come here, would the gentle-
woman agree with that? I yield to the 
gentlewoman. 
b 1400 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. I abso-
lutely agree with the good gentleman. 
This is a place where we are sent to do 
a job for the people of our district. We 
should be able to vote on record and 
not have to hide behind a voice vote. 
We should be able to call for a motion 
to adjourn to give everyone pause and 
thought before they vote for such cru-
cial, critical, radical, transforming leg-
islation. 
I absolutely fully agree with the good 
gentleman from Texas. Congress is a 
place where people should be working 
just as our regular American citizens 
are working 12-hour shifts, working in 
factories, working on job sites, paving 
roads, working in restaurants, serving 
us when we go to eat. This is abso-
lutely a place where we should work, 
where we should be able to use tools to 
represent our districts and not have 
rules changed here in the people’s 
House to stop us from being able to use 
good measures for everyone in Con-
gress to vote, be on record, and do their 
jobs that they have been elected to do. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Georgia. I know 
I have my friend who has been waiting 
patiently, and so I will yield to that 
gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I would just note 
that the gentlewoman from Georgia 
mentioned video taken from southeast 
Texas this morning. I am looking at 
that on social media at the moment, a 
huge line of people waiting for smug-
glers to ferry them across the Rio 
Grande into the United States, video 
courtesy of Tripwires and Triggers, 
which is run by a fellow named Jaeson 
Jones, who is a good friend of mine, 
formerly with the Department of Pub-
lic Safety in Texas. 
Jaeson is on the job, on the spot, 
much like my friend Brandon Darby 
and others who work for Breitbart 
Texas who are on the spot, always try-
ing to look out for the interests of Tex-
ans and American citizens, but also the 
immigrants who seek to come here. 
These immigrants are being abused 
by cartels while my Democrat col-
leagues use them as political props. It 
is unconscionable that we are allowing 
that to continue in the greatest Nation 
in the history of the world, again, all 
for crass political purposes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Montana 
(Mr. 
ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to add 
to that. What is lost on this body 
many, many times over is the inhu-
mane treatment that these many, 
many travelers are experiencing not 
only before they get to the United 
States but then after. 
This is not the land of milk and 
honey for everyone, folks. There are 
people who are pressed into indentured 
servitude once they actually arrive 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I had the privilege 
of going down to the Arizona-Mexico 
border about a month ago with the 
gentleman from Texas and was able to 
see firsthand and meet with Customs 
agents, Border Patrol, local law en-
forcement, and the farmers and ranch-
ers. What falls on deaf ears is the ter-
rible, terrible treatment. 
Our friends from across the aisle 
think that they are being compas-
sionate by opening up the border and 
declaring amnesty for everyone. What 
they don’t understand is that those 
folks are so poorly treated by the car-
tels as they travel north. 
You can break it into three sections. 
As they travel north, these women 
are raped. These children are violently 
assaulted. They are forced and coerced

into carrying drugs across the line. 
And then they are forced to pay $5,000 
to $7,000 to try to pay for that passage. 
Once they get to the border, they are 
then forced to carry drugs across the 
border. 
Once they get north and are actually 
in our country, what happens is, many 
times over, they are forced to pay 25, 30 
percent of their weekly income back to 
a cartel, which then continues to fuel 
other illicit crimes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, reclaim-
ing my time. 
Would the gentleman be surprised if I 
recounted to him the story of when I 
was at the border last year at Laredo, 
and we were having a conversation 
with Border Patrol and went into one 
of the facilities, and we were talking to 
one of the fellows there. While we were 
there, through conversations with one 
of the young men who had come 
across—frankly, encouraged to do so 
and come in and meet with Border Pa-
trol in order to get across. He then 
gave up the location of a stash house in 
Houston, Texas, where we then went 
and found, that day, 50 immigrants in a 
basement, in a stash house in Houston, 
Texas, being held essentially for ran-
som. 
These were human beings, the prod-
uct of a broken system that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
hail as somehow pro-immigrant when 
it is decidedly the opposite of pro-im-
migrant. 
Would the gentleman agree with 
that? 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
would absolutely agree with that. And 
my good friend from Texas, I think 
with your fabulous legal mind, you can 
tell me. As we have these 180 cities 
across the Nation and 11 States that 
have declared themselves sanctuary 
places that these folks can go to, could 
we say that they are complicit in these 
crimes when they are incentivizing 
these people to travel north and get 
trapped in these situations? 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, it cer-
tainly goes without saying. 
I started my remarks earlier about 
the knowledge and the engagement of 
this President and the President’s ad-
ministration, that the policies of this 
administration, the policies of Demo-
crat cities, the policies of Democrat 
States, with sanctuary cities and sanc-
tuary States, and now, effectively, a 
sanctuary Nation, are directly causing 
the movement and the migration of 
human beings to come here, being ex-
ploited by cartels for profit, endan-
gering their lives, endangering Amer-
ican citizens. 
Yes, for any understanding of law, 
you are complicit in what is happening 
to the people in question. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman. 
Then the last point that I would 
make—as my good friend from Vir-
ginia, who was here earlier, made—and 
that is, it impacts every community 
across our Nation. 
We all are border cities now. The 
State of Montana is very proud to host 
to seven sovereign nations, the reserva-
tions. What happens is they become 
target areas for wide distribution of 
methamphetamine and other illicit 
drugs and sex trafficking. Then, those 
problems begin to spill out into the 
other communities around there, so 
the entire State ends up becoming a 
big, big problem. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, and I 
would say to my friend that the 
scourge of human trafficking, in all of 
its elements—and human trafficking in 
the sense of the sex trafficking trade, 
modern-day slavery right here in the 
United States, people being under the 
thumb of dangerous organizations, car-
tels, and illegal organizations embed-
ded in this country. It all has its roots 
and connections, in many ways, to the 
trafficking of human beings across our 
border for profit. 
The power being put over these peo-
ple, in which they are working in sub-
par conditions or put into the sex 
trade, that is happening in the greatest 
country in the history of the world, 
and it is all a direct consequence of ac-
cepting and embracing that lawless-
ness. 
That lawlessness starts at our border 
and is also tied to our lack of enforce-
ment 
and 
interior 
enforcement, 
through ICE, and the other cutbacks by 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. It has. The gen-
tleman from Texas, I think, would 
agree that we are in a sad state when 
the humans across this Nation have de-
volved into where they now have be-
come collateral. 
The family, friends, and relatives of 
the people who have crossed the border 
illegally, their family and their friends 
have devolved into a place that they 
are collateral to make sure that the 
payments are made for the people who 
have actually crossed the border to the 
north. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 15 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, what I 
would like to expand upon is an exten-
sion of what my friend from Montana 
was just talking about, what is hap-
pening to human beings here in the 
United States. 
But now let’s talk a little about the 
impact with respect to COVID and the 
pandemic that we are dealing with. The 
Biden administration, in its infinite 
wisdom directly causing what we are 
seeing at the border, relaxed title 42 to 
allow illegal alien minors to enter the 
country, leading to a massive surge of 
illegal immigrants at the border in 
total. 
In February, CBP encountered nearly 
9,500 unaccompanied alien children at 
the southern border. That is a 28 per-
cent increase over January, more than 
2,000 over last year, and, incredibly, al-
most 30,000 UACs have been encoun-
tered in just the first 5 months of the 
fiscal year, 30,000 children. That is 
nearly a thousand more UACs than the 
first 5 months of last year, but it is a 
74 percent increase over fiscal year 2020 
numbers. 
Here is the thing: It is harming these 
kids, but it is also distracting Border 
Patrol from their job. They are turning 
Border Patrol into an entity that has 
to manage people, kids in facilities, 
but they are no longer doing their job 
between the ports of entry. 
Do you know what that means? 
Fentanyl, narcotics. Why do we have a 
mass opioid crisis in this country? Now 
we are feeding into that as a literal, di-
rect, and obvious result of the policies 
of this administration. 
It has to be, as I said as I opened, ei-
ther complete incompetence or pur-
poseful. Either one of those is unac-
ceptable. 
Madam Speaker, Mexico is closing 
their 
Migrant 
Protection 
Protocol 
shelters where migrants are supposed 
to be tested and confirmed negative for 
COVID before being let into the United 
States. Reports have indicated at least 
108 COVID-positive illegal aliens were 
released by CBP in one fell swoop. Ac-
cording to reports, at least 185 immi-
grants released in the past month in 
Brownsville tested positive. 
Madam Speaker, 25 Border Patrol 
agents have died of COVID, but the ad-
ministration is taking no major steps 
to prioritize those frontline workers 
for the vaccine in the last 2 months. 
Most of them are having to go into the 
communities to go get the vaccine, 
even though they are on the front 
lines, dealing with COVID-positive in-
dividuals coming across our border. 
Madam Speaker, it is for this reason 
that my colleague from New Mexico, 
YVETTE HERRELL, introduced H.R. 471, 
the Protecting Americans from Unnec-
essary Spread upon Entry from COVID 
Act of 2021, or the PAUSE Act. 
Title 42 must remain in effect under 
her act until all State and Federal 
lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, cur-
fews, and other COVID mandates end; 
all public and Federal public health 
emergencies for COVID–19 end; and the 
CDC’s COVID–19 travel health risk 
level for Canada and Mexico is reduced 
to level 1. 
Madam Speaker, that is a good bill. 
We should continue to enforce title 42. 
There are 44 cosponsors to this bill, 
only Republicans. 
Yesterday, I filed H. Res. 216, which 
is a rule to discharge this bill. When it 
ripens, which is another 8 or so legisla-
tive days, we are going to be pushing to 
discharge that bill from committee and 
vote on it on the floor of the House of 
Representatives. 
I hope my Democrat colleagues will 
agree that we should enforce title 42 to 
protect American citizens and make 
sure that we don’t have an epidemic at 
our southern border. 
Madam Speaker, this is what we are 
facing, and it is a direct consequence of

an administration peddling amnesty 
and the false hope to immigrants to 
come here through dangerous channels, 
being abused by cartels in the process. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), my 
friend. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Texas for yield-
ing. 
I am so thrilled you are hammering 
this point. These are people’s lives, as 
you were saying earlier. We just were 
having a hearing in a crime sub-
committee, and an article was intro-
duced that said there are more drugs 
that come in through public ports than 
illegally across our border. 
Well, my friend has been involved in 
enforcing the law as a State pros-
ecutor. There is no one who can tell 
you how much in the way of drugs were 
missing, but these kids are now—there 
is incentive from the Biden administra-
tion to keep reusing these kids. 
Border patrolmen are saying—my 
friend may have touched on this ear-
lier—that, actually, they are recog-
nizing some of the kids who come in 
and help people to stay there, and then 
they will go back across the border and 
come with another group. 
b 1415 
It is bad enough that this adminis-
tration is luring people up, especially 
children, to their detriment, but it is 
even worse when they become just 
products to be used and thrown away. I 
had been standing there all hours of 
the night seeing the long line of people 
being processed and the border patrol-
men were asking their questions. 
At the opposite end where I would go, 
there are people passing kids around 
and asking: Who is going to be the 
mother? Who is going to be the father? 
Do you want this kid? 
I will take the kid. 
Madam Speaker, you can see them. 
Who is going to take the kid? 
Clearly, the child didn’t belong to 
any of the people there. Many multiple 
times I have seen them looking at the 
address that the drug cartel gave them, 
and they are supposed to turn that over 
to Border Patrol, and then ICE or HHS 
would ship them to where the drug car-
tels want them to go, and they are 
switching addresses: I would rather go 
to that one. 
Then they tell the Border Patrol: 
This is where I have a relative. This is 
where I want to go. 
That is why the drug cartels call the 
Border Patrol and us here in the U.S. 
their logistics. They get them illegally 
across the border, and then taxpayers 
ship them to wherever the cartels want 
them. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Texas for his remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I think the gen-
tleman who has spent time at the bor-
der, as I have, would appreciate the 
story that I can recount. When I was 
last there, there was a conversation in-
volving a young man who had come 
across, and he was being questioned, as 
the gentleman just described. He was 
questioned about where he came from 
and all the things to go through, his 
age and so forth, and then at one point 
the young man said he needed to use 
the bathroom. 
The Border Patrol agent said: Oh, 
sure, it is no problem. Let me get up 
and show you where it is. 
He said: Oh, I know. 
He knew. He knew where the bath-
room was. This wasn’t his first rodeo. 
This is happening every day at our bor-
der, literally every day. 
But the media just goes about its 
business, ignoring the crisis now that 
it is not politically expedient to do so. 
My colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle spent the last 3 years saying that 
it is all a manufactured crisis and that 
there is no crisis at the border. Then 
with Trump, there was a crisis sud-
denly. There wasn’t a crisis, and then 
there was a crisis. 
Then there were people drinking out 
of toilets—a lie. Then it was kids in 
cages—a lie. Fences and barriers were 
put up in facilities to protect these 
kids and separate them from the dan-
gerous elements to make sure someone 
claiming that they are this kid’s uncle 
is actually the kid’s uncle. 
Those chain-link barriers that were 
put up in these facilities were put up 
by whom? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. That would be the 
Obama administration, Madam Speak-
er, although now we have some being 
put up by the Biden administration. 
Mr. ROY. That is exactly correct. 
Yet for 4 years under the Trump ad-
ministration, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle went around 
ranting about the treatment of mi-
grants, whom we are dealing with be-
cause of very broken policies, trying to 
protect the kids, keep them from being 
abused, put them in air-conditioned fa-
cilities with airflow, the chain-link 
barriers so you can see them—oh, no. 
Kids in cages. Oh, drinking out of a toi-
let. It was a lie. It was a straight-up 
lie. 
I sent my chief of staff down the next 
day. He went to where they were talk-
ing about it, and it was one of those de-
vices that is a toilet with a water foun-
tain off the back of it, which we have 
in all of our facilities and in a lot of 
our prison facilities and ICE facilities 
in this country. 
By the way, in every bathroom in 
America, the water supply behind the 
drywall is supplying the water to your 
faucet and the water to your toilet, 
Madam Speaker. Oh, but this is kids 
drinking out of toilets. 
‘‘Never let a crisis go to waste,’’ say 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. We are seeing that right now 
with $1.9 trillion. We are seeing that 
right now. And we are seeing the result 
of that right now with a Biden border 
crisis directly of the making of this ad-
ministration. 
It 
is 
the 
direct 
consequence 
of 
undoing and refusing to enforce their 
laws; undoing the migrant protection 
protocol working with Mexico; refusing 
to fully enforce title 42; refusing to go 
through what you are supposed to do 
on asylum determinations; refusing to 
limit catch and release and instead 
turning the Department of Homeland 
Security into a catch-and-release orga-
nization, trumpeting an amnesty bill; 
and then attracting families to come 
through dangerous channels, risking 
their own children and lives at the 
hands of cartels, all to profit and en-
rich cartels; and then have the audac-
ity to say that is compassion and the 
audacity to say that that is pro-immi-
grant. 
Meanwhile, the people I represent, 
the Texans we represent, are having to 
foot the bill. We are having to deal 
with it. We are having to deal with 
schools. We are having to deal with 
high-speed chases. We are having to 
deal with crime, drug trafficking, and 
the reach of cartels in south Texas. 
And no one in this people’s House gives 
a whit because of political expediency. 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
friend from Texas if he has anything 
else he would like to add. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
would just like to reinforce that when 
these 
people 
get 
into 
the 
United 
States, their nightmare is not over. 
They get shipped to towns all over 
America. Those who wear colored arm 
bands now tell the drug cartel what 
their situation is. When they get where 
they are going, they are still under the 
thumb of the drug cartels to either sell 
drugs or sex trafficking. If they don’t 
pay up what they owe, then a family 
member gets killed or some part gets 
cut off. 
We know how bad the drug cartels 
are. So it doesn’t just end there when 
they get to America. That nightmare 
will continue, and this administration 
is all part of it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I will 
close my last minute to just say that it 
is currently easier for the cartels to ex-
ploit our Southern border and to allow 
gang members and dangerous narcotics 
to come into this country than it is for 
the American people to get access to 
the people’s House. Fences with razor 
wire surround this building. We are ap-
parently so afraid of what might hap-
pen to us in this body that we need 
fences and razor wire, but, meanwhile, 
our Southern border is wide open for 
exploitation. 
I am only just reminded of when I 
started that the guy who runs that out-
fit over there in the White House, that 
the guy either is blatantly ignoring his 
duty to defend the border of the United 
States purposely or he has no idea 
what is going on, because no American 
President—no 
American 
President—

should or would allow this kind of ac-
tivity to be happening at our Southern 
border, endangering American citizens 
and endangering immigrants in the 
name of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
AND STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, a very proud and lib-
erated 
Democrat, 
unbought 
and 
unbossed. 
I rise today with a question, Madam 
Speaker. 
The question is: Should the tax-
payers of this country, the good people 
of the United States of America, should 
their tax dollars be utilized to pay for 
the upkeep, the maintenance, and the 
utilities on a building that is named in 
honor of a bigot and a racist? 
Should our tax dollars be used for 
such a purpose? 
Madam Speaker, let me share some-
thing with you. This is the Senate Rus-
sell Office Building. 
This is how the Russell Senate Office 
Building looks. It has a certain degree 
of majesty associated with it. This is 
where Senators do their work. The 
press is found in this building, in an 
area just off of a rotunda. This is the 
Russell Senate Office Building. This is 
what it looks like to the naked eye. 
This is what people see when they drive 
by. Unfortunately, there is much to be 
seen that the eye cannot reveal to the 
brain. 
The building named after this man, 
Senator Richard Russell, is a symbol of 
national shame. And I think that be-
cause it is a symbol of national 
shame—and I shall say more to you 
about it, Madam Speaker, as I do what 
I am about to do, which is to label it 
for what it is: a symbol of national 
shame—we ought not pretend that this 
building is a place that ought to honor 
a person with such a name. 
It is a symbol of national shame paid 
for with tax dollars. These lights and 
the utilities are paid for with tax dol-
lars. 
Who was Senator Richard Russell? 
This is the Senator, Madam Speaker, 
who, in 1935, participated in the very 
first filibuster of a civil rights bill— 
Richard Russell—when he and his col-
leagues stopped an anti-lynching bill 
with 6 days of nonstop talking. 
Senator Richard Russell, in so doing, 
allowed the lynching to continue with-
out legislation that was antithetical to 
it. In this country, up until 1968, some 
3,446 persons—more than 3,000 Black 
people—were lynched in the United 
States of America. 
There are people who don’t want to 
hear this. There are people who would 
say: Wait. At some point we will get 
around to doing the right thing. We 
will bend the arc of the moral universe 
toward justice, and we will change the 
name of this building. 
There are some people who would 
say: Wait, Al, don’t bring this up now. 
Madam Speaker, I refuse to allow 
those who are not suffering to deter-
mine the timeline for the suffering to 
end for those who do suffer. I am one of 
those who happens to be suffering, and 
it is painful for me to see this symbol 
of national shame in the United States 
of America, the country I love. 
I believe that it is time now for us to 
make that change. We have had some 
40-plus 
years—about 
49 
years—to 
change this, and we haven’t done it. It 
is time to change it. I am not going to 
wait for someone else to say that it is 
okay to come to the floor and say that 
you can make this change. 
I am a liberated, unbought, unbossed 
Democrat. It is time for this to change. 
It has got to change. 
How soon should we change this? 
Immediately, if not sooner. If it 
doesn’t 
change 
today 
and 
doesn’t 
change tomorrow, I will still stand my 
ground. It has to change, and I will 
await that change. It must change. 
A little bit more about Senator Rus-
sell. It was in 1972, shortly after his de-
mise, that the Senate voted over-
whelmingly, 99–1, that the old Senate 
Office Building be named the Russell 
Senate Office Building. Madam Speak-
er, the vote was 99–1. They knew when 
they did it that he was a bigot and a 
racist. 
Madam Speaker, when I say it ought 
to happen immediately, I assure you 
there are some names that I could give 
this evening of people who have similar 
histories who are still alive, and if we 
named a building after one of these 
people, then this Congress would as-
semble and would change that name 
immediately. 
b 1430 
I know what we can do when we want 
to do something, so there is no ques-
tion about whether there is a way to 
get this done. The question is: Do we 
have the will to do it? Do we have the 
will to take a racist and a bigot’s name 
off of a building that is housing the 
Senate, Members of it? 
I decline to go into the building. I 
will never say that I will never go in, 
simply because there are times when, 
of necessity, I may have to. But when 
I do, I do it with a degree of shame. I 
am not proud when I have to go into 
that building. 
The last time I was there it was to 
show some other person the rotunda 
where his statue happens to be. He oc-
cupies a space all to himself. It is not 
like going through other areas where 
you see multiple personalities rep-
resented. He has a space all to himself, 
a bigot and a racist; and we, who have 
the power to make the change, tolerate 
it. 
A bit more about Senator Russell. 
Here is a statement from the Senator; 
perhaps not a direct, exact quote, but 
here is a statement from the Senator: 
‘‘As one who was born and reared in the 
atmosphere of the Old South, with six 
generations of my forebears now rest-
ing beneath southern soil, I am willing 
to go as far and make as great a sac-
rifice to preserve and insure white su-
premacy’’—some things bear repeating. 
He said: ‘‘To preserve and insure white 
supremacy in the social, economic, and 
political life of our State as any man 
who lives within her borders.’’ 
He is taking a pledge to maintain 
white 
supremacy, 
Senator 
Richard 
Russell; a Senate office building in his 
honor, in his name. 
Let’s just continue with a bit more 
about Senator Richard Russell. Sen-
ator Richard Russell blocked the pas-
sage of a 1942 bill to eliminate poll 
taxes. 
Senator Richard Russell co-authored 
the ‘‘Southern Manifesto’’ in 1956 with 
Senator Strom Thurmond, in opposi-
tion 
to 
the 
integration 
of 
public 
schools. Fought integration. It was 
segregation. He was a segregationist. 
It was segregation that caused me to 
get on a bus that was in disrepair, that 
would break down, to ride within 
blocks of other schools predominated 
with persons who are Anglo, or were 
Anglo at the time, ride past those 
schools for some 20 to 30 minutes to get 
to another school in another city. That 
is what segregation did. 
It was segregation that caused me to 
get books that were hand-me-downs 
when the other schools where Anglos 
were had the books. When they were 
finished with the books, when they got 
new books, then I could get a better 
book that was not the latest edition of 
the book I needed. 
It was segregation that caused me to 
have to go to colored water fountains. 
It was segregation that put me in the 
back of the bus. 
It was segregation that forced me to 
the balcony of the movie. 
It was segregation that locked us up 
in the bottom of the jails. 
I know segregation. I know what it 
looks like. I have seen its ugly face. 
The Klan burned a cross in my yard. 
I know what it smells like. I have 
had to drink from those filthy water 
fountains. 
I know what it sounds like. I have 
had people call me ugly names. 
So I just hope my friends will not get 
too discombobulated when they hear 
that AL GREEN came to the floor and 
said what he is saying now. Don’t ex-
pect me to tolerate this. You can get 
some others to do it, but you won’t get 
me to do it. 
I will not tolerate this. I demand 
that this change take place. I am not 
asking. 
Why would I engage in the protocols 
of polite society when this level of big-
otry exists in my face? 
Let’s talk a little bit more about 
Senator Richard Russell. He led the 60-

day filibuster against the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964; led the southern boycott of 
the Democratic National Convention in 
1964, after LBJ—one of the greatest 
Presidents ever, in my opinion—signed 
the Civil Rights Act. 
He called the Civil Rights Act short-
sighted and dangerous. Those civil 
rights acts, the act of 1965, when Presi-
dent Johnson signed it, he signed it in 
ink, but it was written with the blood 
of those who crossed the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, the Honorable John 
Lewis having been one of them. 
I remember talking to him. He said 
he thought he was going to die. 
Signed in ink but written in blood. 
John Lewis was a great and noble 
American. 
That Civil Rights Act is probably the 
reason that I am here. I probably 
wouldn’t be in Congress if not but for 
what happened on the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge; people who had the desire to 
see liberty and justice for all, but who 
also had the ability to take the blows 
to their bodies without resorting to re-
taliation. 
If they had retaliated on the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, it would have been just 
another melee. It would have been just 
another skirmish. But they didn’t. And 
because they suffered, I am able to 
stand here and make these comments. 
So you can well understand, I hope 
and I pray, that—because I know how I 
got here—I am not going to tolerate 
this. I know how I got here. 
I didn’t get here because I am so 
smart. I got here because somebody 
found out what a 90-pound German 
Shepherd bites like. 
I am here because somebody under-
stands what it is like to go to jail for 
a cause. 
I am here because somebody under-
stands what it is like to lose a loved 
one—Myrlie Evers—for a cause. 
So let’s not play games. I am not 
here to satisfy and satiate those who 
would say wait, give us a chance to do 
this on our own terms. 
You have had 49 years; 49 years too 
many, in my opinion. So I am not 
going to wait. And I will be back again 
to talk more about this after I finish 
what I am about to say now. 
Senator Richard Russell twice, 1949 
and 1964, introduced legislation—this is 
a painful thing to read. This is a pain-
ful thing to have to utter—twice intro-
duced legislation to move African 
Americans out of Southern States. 
That is Senator Richard Russell. 
So dear friends, I beg your pardon if 
anyone takes offense at what I have 
said. But I must tell you, I would say it 
again, and probably will, given the op-
portunity because, at some point in 
life, you just have to take a stand. 
The people who sent me here, they 
didn’t send me here to go along as a re-
sult of toleration of things like this. 
They didn’t send me here to go along 
so that I could move along. They sent 
me here to take a stand. And there are 
times in life when it is better to stand 
alone than not stand at all. 
I am a liberated Democrat. I stand 
alone, but I stand on truth. I stand on 
the words of Carlyle, ‘‘No lie can live 
forever.’’ 
This is the ultimate manifestation of 
insidious prevarication to imply that 
this should be honored with the name 
of Russell. 
Now, there are those who are going 
to say, well, AL GREEN, what would you 
name the building? A tactic quite often 
used, because when I say, well, let’s 
name it—you complete the sentence— 
they will say, well, I think it ought to 
be named—you complete the sentence. 
But that is not what I am saying, 
dear brothers and sisters—and I say 
brothers and sisters, because, in my 
heart, I believe there is just one race, 
as Dr. King put it, the human race. And 
I believe that all persons are created 
equal, from a bass black to a treble 
white on God’s keyboard, as he put it. 
So, my dear brothers and sisters, 
that is not what I am saying. I am say-
ing, take this name off, Russell. I am 
saying, let it revert back to the name 
it had before Russell was placed on it. 
That name was the Old Senate Office 
Building. I am saying, let it revert 
back to the Old Senate Office Building, 
and you decide the name. The name I 
will leave to you until and unless there 
is a need to prevent this from hap-
pening again, something similar. 
But there are many people worthy of 
having this building bear their names. 
This man is not worthy. This man does 
not deserve this honor. 
So let it revert back to the Old Sen-
ate Office Building, and then do what 
we do; get a committee; get a commis-
sion; find a way to name it appro-
priately. And then I believe that those 
that I speak for, who do not live in the 
suites of life, who live in the streets of 
life, those that I speak for, who are 
among the least, the last, and the lost, 
those that I speak for, who are not 
among the well-off, the well-heeled, 
and the well-to-do, those that I speak 
for, many of whom have gone to glory, 
but I believe that they will find reason 
to know that change, long though it 
may be in coming, that change can 
take place, and that this country will 
be a better place for it. The country I 
love, by the way. 
I am not the guy that you are going 
to tag with this mantra, this label, this 
caption, this style: He doesn’t love his 
country. I love my country. 
I am not the guy that you are going 
to tag with, he is a flag burner. I wear 
the flag. 
You can’t tag me with being a guy 
who refuses to stand for the national 
anthem. I stand and I sing the national 
anthem. 
You can’t tag me with being the guy 
who refuses to say the Pledge of Alle-
giance. I say the Pledge of Allegiance. 
But now, tag me, label me as the guy 
who loves his country and who refuses 
to accept this level of bigotry, who re-
fuses to accept allowing the tax dollars 
from people who are eking out a place 
in the world, for their tax dollars to be 
used for this. I am that guy. I am the 
guy who is going to stand up for this— 
against this, if you will. 
b 1445 
Finally, this: I never came to Con-
gress to say what I am saying. I came 
to Congress to help people who were in 
need of housing. That was what I 
thought I would do. I came to Congress 
to help people get a decent day’s pay 
for a hard day’s work. 
This is not something that I planned, 
but it is something that I cannot stand, 
and I have to stand against it. There is 
just something that won’t allow me to 
tolerate this. 
I know that this will engender some 
additional detractors. I get the calls; I 
know. But there just comes a time in 
your life when you have to decide that 
there are some things worth making a 
sacrifice for. I choose to do what I do 
because I know how I got here. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
DEAL WITH CRISIS AT SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor to follow my fellow former 
judge from Texas. We both know Jesus, 
and one of Jesus’ comments was that if 
we were just lukewarm, we would be 
spit out of the mouth. I know my 
friend’s heart, and he is passionate 
about things that he sees as unjust, so 
I know he is in no danger of ever being 
spit out because he does have that pas-
sion and cares so deeply. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas, my friend. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my friend for his kind 
words. He and I spoke earlier today, 
and I believe that there are people who 
assume things about us that are just 
not true. 
There are probably people who as-
sume that he and I don’t get along, but 
they don’t understand that there are 
things that can bring people together 
that supersede the physicalities that 
we place all of our emphasis on. 
I would have the world know that he 
and I talk and that we don’t have hard 
conversations about the things that 
are important to both of us. I appre-
ciate his kind words. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
know that we are brothers, and we are 
going to be together for a long time. I 
am not talking about here in this 
Chamber. Anyway, I appreciate my 
friend very much. 
I didn’t know anything about Sen-
ator Russell, but I have gotten an edu-
cation. I thank him. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my dear brother. God bless 
him.

H1348 
March 11, 2021 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, my 
friend was a former judge in Houston. 
In fact, he was the kind of judge that is 
the only judge in Texas that is allowed 
to order an exhumation of a body. We 
ran into that in one of my criminal 
trials, and we had to find a justice who 
would do that. Texas entrusts a great 
deal with our judges. 
I did want to touch on some things 
that I feel rather passionate about be-
cause I know people are being hurt. 
My friend CHIP ROY and I were talk-
ing earlier. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, 
MATT ROSENDALE, a number of people 
spoke on this, but we can’t speak 
enough on what is happening at the 
border. It is absolutely a crisis, and it 
really does need to be dealt with. 
Regardless of what anybody thinks 
about President Trump, put that aside 
and look at the border. Look at what it 
does to people who have been standing 
in line for years to come into this 
country legally. 
We know, and it has been established 
numerous times, people are not allowed 
to cross the southern border unless 
they pay something to the drug car-
tels. It may be paid through the gang 
member, through the coyote that is 
bringing them into the country, but it 
is still the drug cartels. They are still 
in the drug business; they are still in 
the prostitution and sex-trafficking 
business. 
It disturbs me that not enough Amer-
icans are upset about how much sex 
trafficking has gone on. They get abso-
lutely worked up when they find out an 
American has been pulled into sex traf-
ficking and not allowed to get out of it. 
But it happens all the time, especially 
with Hispanics from south of our bor-
der. The rapes that occur along the 
way have been established by different 
groups and means. 
It is just an abomination that more 
people are not upset, deeply upset, 
about what is going on, enough so that 
a majority in both Chambers, House 
and Senate, would do something about 
it, not leave incentives out there dan-
gling to lure more people into dealing 
with the drug cartels. It used to be 
they made most of their money from 
the drug trafficking, and that is still 
probably true. 
As I started to mention earlier, my 
friend CHIP ROY and I had an article 
dangled in our hearing that says, oh, 
gee, more drugs came in through public 
ports of entry than came through ille-
gally across other parts of the border. 
But what I have seen with my own 
eyes and heard with my own ears, 
spending a lot of time down on the bor-
der, the Border Patrol, when they see a 
big group, especially with a bunch of 
children, most of the ones I talk to say 
we know when we get a group like 
that, the drug cartels are coordinating 
when they come across the border, es-
pecially there at the river south of 
McAllen. 
They know, when they send a group 
like that, especially in the middle of 
the night, it is going to take a lot of 
border patrolmen to go through, ask 
the questions, document, and in-proc-
ess each one. They will tell you that is 
when we know they are sending drugs. 
Sometimes, it may be a high-value per-
son who they are trying to get across 
into the U.S. 
But I know, one night, on the Texas 
Department of Public Safety boats— 
they have a couple of them there on 
that part of the river. They have the 
thermal technology and night vision. 
They were identifying people along the 
river waiting to come across. The Bor-
der Patrol identified the groups, and 
eventually, the Border Patrol said: 
Why don’t you guys go back to the 
dock, and then we will catch them try-
ing to enter? 
Well, I thought that meant they 
would be turned away. But this was 
during the Obama administration, and 
their instructions were: No, don’t turn 
anybody away. Just in-process them. 
There were numerous groups of more 
than 10 or 20 in size, and we got the re-
port from the Border Patrol that they 
caught all the groups that were going 
to cross. But those groups of two or 
three that appeared to be bringing 
drugs, they somehow knew where to 
come across and come into some 
bushes, and we never found them. 
It is impossible for anyone to report 
how much in the way of drugs comes 
across our border outside of a public 
port of entry, an official port of entry, 
because they don’t catch them. 
In fact, it seems like, from my expe-
rience of being there, I have seen—ac-
tually, it surprised me. It sure sur-
prised them. There were some guys 
that were up on a pump cage, and they 
were on the move. They had people 
with them. They were on the move. 
It was because they knew a big group 
had just come across the Rio Grande 
River, and the Border Patrol had seen 
the truck. I knew the direction they 
came from. I had seen the truck. They 
knew that the Border Patrol would 
have to zoom to where all of those peo-
ple were, have to get some kind of a 
bus like they have there, and process 
all of those people at the site and get 
them on the bus and bring them into 
McAllen. 
These guys knew all of the Border 
Patrol was tied up with the people. 
They had a bunch of kids in that group, 
so that meant they really had to con-
centrate on that group. These were 
clearly people who were doing some-
thing illicit and illegal. 
I didn’t see their drugs, but they 
clearly were doing something very il-
licit, and they also knew that the Bor-
der Patrol was going to be tied up. 
I visited with the Border Patrol and 
had 
seen 
what 
they 
were 
doing, 
watched some of the in-processing, but 
they knew how long it took to in-proc-
ess a group like that. They knew they 
had time to do what they wanted. It 
was only a mile or two up the road 
from where they knew the Border Pa-
trol was occupied. 
There were a couple of guys up as 
lookouts and some others who were 
carrying something down below, but 
they all took off into the trees. I didn’t 
know if they were armed, and I wasn’t 
armed at the time, so I didn’t pursue 
them. 
You have to know, there are a lot of 
things that cross the border that no-
body has accounted for. Look at the 
business model. If you don’t have any 
conscience, it is a great business 
model. Fortunately, most people I 
know do have a conscience and would 
never do this. But without a con-
science, they are thinking: Okay, we 
need drug salespeople in every town in 
America. All we have to do is get them 
across the border, give them the ad-
dress where we want them to sell 
drugs. 
They give that to the Border Patrol, 
and either HHS or ICE gets them where 
they want them. That is why Border 
Patrol says the drug cartels call us 
their logistics. They get their future 
employees across the border. 
They think that they are just coming 
and going to have a free life in Amer-
ica, but they are going to be working 
for the drug cartels. It is not slavery, 
as that abomination is known, but it is 
a form of indentured servitude. They 
owe being in the United States to the 
drug cartels, and they are going to 
have to pay them. They made that deal 
to get into the U.S. 
The reason they were willing to 
make that deal to get in the U.S. now 
is because they keep hearing the Biden 
administration is going to let every-
body in and give them all amnesty. 
That lures more and more people into 
these terrible circumstances. It needs 
to stop. 
I will repeat again what I have been 
saying for years. The most caring, 
compassionate thing we could do for 
our neighbor Mexico and its citizens to 
the south of us, when we know they 
have great raw materials, great min-
erals, wonderful hardworking people, 
the majority of whom believe in a God, 
as most of the Founders did—they love 
their families. 
b 1500 
I love watching Hispanic family re-
unions. It reminds me so much of re-
unions I used to see in the town where 
I grew up. They love their families. 
That is a wonderful thing. These at-
tributes that folks south of the border 
have, those are things that help make 
America the greatest Nation in the 
world, and we need more of what they 
have, but it needs to be done legally. 
And to not care at the way that they 
are manipulated by the cartels? 
Their business model, send them 
across. The U.S. taxpayers will pay to 
ship them to whatever town we want 
them to sell drugs in or be involved in 
prostitution 
or 
human 
trafficking 
themselves. The U.S. taxpayers will 
pay to ship them there. And then once 
there, they all know, we know where 
their families are in Mexico or Central 
America, and they will keep paying as 
long as we tell them or they know we

don’t mind cutting off heads, cutting 
off appendages, and sending the mes-
sage. 
So the best thing we could do, 
though, secure the border. Dry up that 
tens of billions of dollars, maybe over a 
hundred billion dollars a year that 
they get from the drug business, from 
the human trafficking, from the sex 
trafficking. Dry that money up. We 
will never dry it completely up because 
there are always people who will look 
for ways. 
But you cut that $80 billion or $100 
billion or so down to even $10 billion, it 
dries up their ability to control so 
much of the national and local govern-
ment. It would surely put an end to so 
many policemen, police chiefs, and 
mayors that have stood up to the car-
tels only to have their heads cut off 
and, in some cases, put on a pike. 
We are providing the money in this 
country to the drug cartels to create 
corruption run amok in the Mexican 
Government. So caring, compassionate 
people would say, let’s dry up the drug 
cartels’ money, and that will do more 
for the American people. 
They won’t have to put their lives at 
risk or risk sexual abuse, all kinds of 
abuse, death, being left by coyote out 
in the desert somewhere. They won’t 
have to risk that because the country 
they love—many will say, ‘‘I would 
rather stay there if there were oppor-
tunity.’’ 
They get the opportunity if we help 
end the corruption. But there is cor-
ruption enough. Talking to a DEA 
agent earlier this afternoon, there is so 
much corruption you don’t know who 
even in the national government is on 
the payroll of the drug cartels. 
So let’s help the Mexican people, 
Central American people, even some 
from South America, let’s help them 
by giving them the freedom in their 
own country without a corrupt govern-
ment so they can have the kind of free-
dom we have here. 
In this article from March 10th, Alex 
Nitzberg says: ‘‘More than 92,000 Clark 
County, NV mail ballots returned un-
deliverable in general election.’’ 
It talks about corruption in the last 
election. Just tragic, tragic stuff. If we 
keep heading this direction, we are 
surely going to end up like some of 
these corrupt countries. 
But there is another article I just 
saw today that indicates that Ven-
ezuelans are coming from Venezuela 
into the United States illegally, and 
why they are doing that is because of 
the corruption and oppression in Ven-
ezuela. 
Under their progressive, Socialist 
country government down there, they 
have taken what many say was the 
most prosperous, vibrant country in 
South America, Venezuela, all the oil 
they had there. They took that country 
and, as socialism will ultimately do 
wherever it is tried, turned it into a fi-
asco. So the Venezuelans were fleeing 
and coming to the United States. 
And the question continues to come 
as to what will Americans do? Where 
will they go? When the path we are on 
to become the devastated Venezuela 
are perpetrated on America, where will 
Americans go? 
They can’t go to Venezuela. It has al-
ready been economically and socially 
destroyed by the Socialists. 
And as friends from Australia told 
me a few years ago, you know, if any-
thing happens to the freedom in the 
United States, you are not going to be 
coming to Australia. They felt like 
China would take them over before 
anybody in the U.S. had time to go 
there. There will be no place to go. 
You know, Venezuela, they have got 
America to try to get into since their 
wonderful, vibrant country has been 
destroyed by socialism. We won’t have 
anyplace. 
As I think Reagan said, this is the 
last best chance on Earth. We have 
been so blessed. And the old saying 
about give a man a fish and he can eat 
for a day; teach him how to fish, and he 
can eat for a lifetime. Instead of just 
saying, yeah, come on to America, we 
will let everybody in and we will all 
pay you welfare, we will give you free 
healthcare, ultimately the whole sys-
tem will be bankrupt and nobody will 
have anyplace to go, why not help 
them get rid of the corruption and stay 
in the country they love? 
Then we have neighbors like Mexico 
and Venezuela, if we can help them 
stop the corruption, with whom we can 
trade, we can visit, we can vacation. 
My wife and I had our honeymoon at 
a place in Mexico. We haven’t been 
back 
in 
recent 
years, 
though 
we 
thought about it, as we keep cele-
brating anniversaries. It would be nice 
to go back where we had our honey-
moon, but there is just too much cor-
ruption in Mexico and it is not worth 
the chance, in our opinion. 
So wouldn’t it be wonderful if we 
took a stand, we dried up the drug cul-
ture, the drug cartels’ money by secur-
ing our Southern border? 
And then the Mexican people have a 
vibrant country that Americans fall in 
love with all over again. We visit, vaca-
tion there. They visit, vacation here. 
And we mutually help each other. But 
continuing to fund tens of billions of 
dollars to go to the drug cartels in 
Mexico keeps the Mexican people under 
the thumb of the drug cartel corrup-
tion. 
Now, going back to the point about 
the DEA, the U.S. Government, they 
cannot know how much in the way of 
drugs that they don’t know about. And 
I know I have got friends on the other 
side of the aisle who think, oh, well, 
there is a report, there is more drugs 
going through our public ports of entry 
than there are going across our border, 
where we don’t know they are crossing. 
The truth is, we don’t know what we 
don’t know about how much and what 
kind of drugs are coming across our 
border. 
I know. I voted against putting 
Sudafed behind the counter, but I un-
derstood drugstores, grocery stores had 
a problem with people stealing it be-
cause that was an ingredient in making 
methamphetamine. But according to 
what pharmacies and others tell me, 
law enforcement, in Texas, okay, once 
you put Sudafed behind the counter, 
making it harder to get, certainly 
harder 
to 
steal, 
homegrown 
meth 
ceased being the problem it used to be, 
and now we are getting much stronger 
drugs coming from Mexico, and they 
are much more addictive than even the 
methamphetamine. 
And I had enough people come in, 
meth cases that I totally understand. 
It is extremely addictive. But now we 
have got more and worse drugs coming 
from Mexico than what we had when 
they were homemade. It did get more 
difficult for a while when a new way of 
cooking methamphetamine, what they 
called a cold cook, didn’t smell as bad. 
For so long it was easy to find meth 
plants because they smelled so bad. 
But, anyway, how much meth being 
cooked, not to the extent it used to be 
in Texas. They are bringing up strong-
er, more addictive, more individual-de-
stroying drugs from Mexico. 
President Trump did what he could 
to get the border secure. We were on 
the way to a much more secure border. 
In fact, people are not aware in the 
second term of George W. Bush, a num-
ber of Texas Members of Congress were 
upset that more had not been done by 
a Republican administration headed by 
a Texan to secure our border. And, ac-
tually, President Bush had Karl Rove 
meet with us. And we began to meet 
every 2 weeks, as I recall, and Rove 
would have the latest report every 2 
weeks about how much progress was 
being made toward securing our border. 
One thing he didn’t have—that Presi-
dent Bush didn’t have was more fence 
or walls on the Southern border, which 
makes it easier. Sure, people can build 
a bigger ladder, as some used to say, 
but it at least slows them down where 
it is easier to keep them out of the 
country with their illicit, illegal drugs 
and sex trafficking. 
So President Trump knew the value 
of a wall, and his knowledge of how im-
portant a wall or a fence was has been 
totally and for all time confirmed by 
the Democratic administration and the 
Speaker and the Senate majority lead-
er, as evidenced by the wall or fence, 
whatever you want to call it, with all 
the razor wire around the top. Some 
places you have got two layers of that. 
So all this time people were saying, 
you know, it doesn’t help, you can’t 
stop people. It doesn’t do any good. But 
we knew it did good because former 
President Obama got him a new house 
up somewhere around here and built a 
10-foot wall around it. So we knew, re-
gardless of what people were saying, 
they knew that a wall or a fence could 
make a difference. 
But we are hoping that since there is 
no threat and since the concerns that 
the Speaker and majority leader here 
in the House had that there was going 
to be another inauguration last Thurs-
day—we knew that wasn’t going to

happen. I am just surprised that they 
were believing QAnon. I didn’t know 
anybody on our side who believed 
QAnon, but apparently the Speaker 
and the majority leader were concerned 
that QAnon knew what he or she or 
they, whatever it is, were talking 
about. So we called off Congress—they 
called off Congress last Thursday. 
So we are hoping that as they see 
that their beliefs and their concerns 
are being assuaged, the acting chief of 
the Capitol Police has confirmed there 
is no Member of Congress who is a 
threat to another Member of Congress, 
no intel from any source that indicates 
that. I have had friends across the aisle 
say, well, LAUREN
BOEBERT
talked 
about wanting to bring a gun on the 
floor, and that is scary. 
b 1515 
Well, that is also a testimony that 
firearms can be the great equalizer. 
Lauren tells me she is five foot exactly, 
so that should reaffirm if she has got 
people in this body that are concerned 
about her, it is not because of her five 
foot status, it is because sometimes she 
has a firearm with her, and it truly is 
the great equalizer. 
And I don’t hear a lot of people talk-
ing about the number of lives that are 
saved by law-abiding citizens that have 
firearms and prevent crimes. 
Madam Speaker, I see my time is ex-
piring. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
f 
THE CURRENT ISSUE AT THE 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak one more time 
about the current issue at the border. 
We have gone from a situation in 
which 1 year ago at this time there 
were 36,000 confrontations at the bor-
der to last February 100,000 encounters 
at the border. 
In addition to a three-fold increase, 
there has been a corresponding in-
crease in unaccompanied children at 
the border. 
How did this happen? There are sev-
eral 
policies 
that 
should 
be 
re-
instituted immediately. 
First of all, prior to President Trump 
being sworn in, we had a policy in 
which the Mexican Government was 
keeping people on their side of the bor-
der pending an asylum hearing. We 
have now undone that policy, which 
does three things: 
First of all, new people arriving at 
the border are escorted into the United 
States and sent somewhere inland. 
Secondly, people who have been wait-
ing on the Mexican side of the border 
are coming across. 
And thirdly, you are sending the 
message around the world that the 
United States is not enforcing their 
immigration laws the way they are in-
tended to be enforced. The word gets 
out, be it in Central America, be it in 
Mexico, be it in Asia, be it in Brazil, 
the United States is inviting people in. 
And with that situation comes the 
three-fold increase. 
Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Home-
land Security under President Obama 
said at one time that 1,000 encounters a 
day at the southern border was a bad 
number. We now have three times what 
was considered a bad number under 
Barack Obama. 
The next thing we are doing is, we 
are getting rid of the agreements we 
had in Central America. President 
Trump maybe tweeted too much, but 
he engaged in negotiations with Guate-
mala, El Salvador, and Honduras so 
that people stayed down there, rather 
than coming through Mexico to the 
United States. He did it, to a certain 
extent, with the carrot and stick of for-
eign aid which the United States had 
sent to those countries. That policy 
has also changed. And with the change 
in that policy people are streaming up 
through Central America. 
Again, from year to year there has 
been a 61 percent increase in unaccom-
panied children. People purport to say 
that they care about children being 
separated from their parents. Well, 
when you have more and more unac-
companied children showing up at the 
border, what do you think that means? 
These children inevitably are going to 
wind up separated from their parents, 
keeping families apart. 
I should point out, by the way, an-
other thing that I am told bothers Cen-
tral American countries. In this coun-
try in an effort to sometimes keep a 
child with both parents, if the parents 
don’t get along that well, courts make 
an effort to keep both parents in the 
same region. 
I am told that the Central American 
countries do not like the fact that the 
United States sometimes will take 
children with even one parent, leaving 
the other parent behind. I think it 
would be better if we improved our re-
lationship with those countries by try-
ing to keep children with both parents. 
Other things that have been done is, 
sadly, we stopped the border wall con-
struction. When I was down at the bor-
der we learned, with regard to the bor-
der wall, it takes four or five agents to 
man 2 miles of the old wall, which was 
sometimes little more than minor fenc-
ing. Now, with the new wall we need 
one Border Patrol agent for 2 miles, so 
there is a substantial savings there, as 
well. 
The catch and release policies are 
back, and with it a crisis is coming. 
America has to apply more pressure or 
tell the Biden administration, please, 
there is a reason why we have tripled 
the number of people, the number of 
encounters our Border Patrol is having 
today compared to this time last year. 
It is the policies that have been imple-
mented in the first month and a half of 
the Biden administration. 
Please, President Biden, go back to 
the old policies in which people are 
held on the southern border and people 
can get a good hearing on their asylum 
claims, rather than creating a system 
in which, as a practical matter, people 
come here illegally and wind up just 
blending into the background. 
It is unfair to the people who are try-
ing to access our country legally that 
people are coming here illegally and 
skipping ahead of them. Inevitably, as 
we take people without vetting them, 
we are getting a given number of peo-
ple taking advantage of our benefits, 
and we are getting a number of people 
who are sneaking illegal drugs across 
the southern border. 
So, again, we have sent letters to 
President Biden, and I please ask him 
to respond to these letters and let the 
American public know: What is your 
plan to stop 100,000 people a month 
coming across the border before that 
100,000 becomes 200,000 or 300,000? 
And it will become 200,000 or 300,000 
because people around the world are 
watching the President, and if the 
President continues to make it clear he 
does not intend to enforce the border, 
people from all around the world will 
be coming here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2021 
No. 46 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You have always been 
our helper. Continue to teach our law-
makers to live for Your glory. 
Lord, lead them along the paths that 
will keep our Nation strong. Give them 
confidence in Your guidance and a pas-
sion for Your truth. Strengthen them 
so that they will be courageous in de-
fense of righteousness. Inspire them to 
wait patiently for the ultimate tri-
umph of Your prevailing providence. 
May they find spiritual nourishment 
simply by being kind to each other. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, the Senate completed an ex-
tremely productive day by confirming 
three members of President Biden’s 
Cabinet. Today, we are going to keep 
up the pace by moving the ball forward 
on two more of the President’s nomi-
nees. 
First, the Senate will begin the proc-
ess of bringing Xavier Becerra’s nomi-
nation to the floor to serve as HHS 
Secretary. This is a critical position as 
we continue to battle the virus, and I 
am perplexed that none of my Repub-
lican colleagues would vote for him. He 
is a capable man, and he has worked 
hard to make sure that people get 
healthcare. Some have said: Well, he is 
not a doctor. Neither was the previous 
Trump nominee for HHS, who happened 
to be a pharmaceutical company execu-
tive. Whom would Americans prefer? 
Second, the Senate will move forward 
with another very historic nominee 
who makes us so proud, Representative 
DEB HAALAND of New Mexico, to serve 
as the next Secretary of the Interior. 
She will be confirmed on Monday. Rep-
resentative HAALAND was elected to the 
Congress in 2018. She was the first Na-
tive American woman, along with Rep-
resentative SHARICE DAVIDS of Kansas, 
to ever serve in the people’s House. If 
confirmed, 
Representative 
HAALAND 
will not only become the first Native 
American to lead the Department of 
the Interior, but she will be the first 
Native American to serve in any Cabi-
net position in American history. We 
have had a Vice President with Native 
American roots but never a Cabinet of-
ficial. 
Given the long and troubled relation-
ship between the Federal Government 
and Tribal nations, the ascension of 
Representative HAALAND to the top of 
the Interior Department is a pro-
foundly important moment for Amer-
ica as we advance on the long road— 
still not fully traveled at all—toward 
equality. For too long, Tribal nations 
have been denied a seat at the table 
where decisions were made that im-
pacted their lives and their land. Not 
only will Secretary HAALAND ensure 
that they get a seat, she will bring her 
own lived experiences to the table 
alongside them. 
Under President Trump, the Depart-
ment of the Interior became one of the 
most scandal-ridden Agencies in the 
history of the Federal Government. It 
gave oil and mining companies carte 
blanche to drill in wildlife reserves. It 
rolled back environmental protections 
and greatly undermined trust in the 
Federal Government and Tribal lands. 
Representative HAALAND will move 
the Department in a dramatically dif-
ferent direction. One of her most im-
portant responsibilities will be to re-
store and uphold the Federal Govern-
ment’s obligations to sovereign Tribal 
nations. I cannot think of a better can-
didate to take on this job than Rep-
resentative HAALAND, and I greatly 
look forward to confirming her. It will 
be historic. 
Now, in general, Madam President, 
the Senate is making great progress in 
installing 
President 
Biden’s 
highly 
qualified nominees. So far, we have al-
ready confirmed 16 Cabinet-level ap-
pointments. We are set to increase that 
number 
to 
18 
after 
Secretaries 
HAALAND
and Becerra are approved. 
Every single one of the President’s 
nominees has been confirmed with a bi-
partisan vote here on the Senate floor. 
President Biden deserves to have his 
team in place, and the Senate is mov-
ing quickly to get the job done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1478 
March 11, 2021 
which finally cleared the hurdle in 
Congress yesterday by passing the 
House, it is now only a Presidential 
signature away from becoming law. 
Soon—very soon—the most sweeping 
recovery effort in recent history will 
get underway. 
Direct checks will be delivered to 
American 
families 
from 
coast 
to 
coast—roughly, 85 percent of all house-
holds. The American people can expect 
those $1,400 checks for each person in 
the family to be delivered by the end of 
March, and we are making amazingly 
good progress on vaccines. Vaccines 
will be available far more quickly to 
far more people. 
Just this morning, the Biden admin-
istration announced an expansion of 
the vaccine program, and I was able to 
announce that more than 100 commu-
nity health centers in my home State 
of New York will be eligible to get 
their own, dedicated supply of vac-
cines. There is a brand new vaccine su-
percharge for New York and for some 
of the rest of the Nation as well—the 
crux: more vaccines and more sites to 
administer them. Over 100 sites will be 
set up across New York State to ad-
minister a massive influx of new shot 
supplies. 
There is light at the end of this 
COVID tunnel, which has always been 
centered on access to a free vaccine for 
all New Yorkers. More access and more 
shots mean a quicker recovery, and 
that is what we want, and that is be-
coming available for my home State of 
New York and for the entire Nation. 
The CHC sites, or community health 
center sites, will be federally funded 
and organized by the Department of 
Health and Human Services—a huge 
expansion. We have all heard numerous 
stories of people having to travel too 
far to get the vaccine, hampering our 
ability to recover and return to nor-
mal. With this announcement of more 
vaccines and more New York sites to 
administer them, New Yorkers have 
something to celebrate, and I thank 
the President for working with us to 
make this effort real and to bring it to 
every State in the Nation. Other things 
are happening, too. 
Our schools will receive critical as-
sistance to update their infrastructure, 
hire more teachers and tutors, and pre-
pare to reopen as fast and as safely as 
possible. 
There is going to be money for 
broadband. There are going to be dol-
lars for rural hospitals. There are going 
to be dollars to help our Tribal na-
tions—all who are suffering. The new 
RESTAURANTS Act, which is so im-
portant to so many of our States, is be-
coming law. More money for Save our 
Stages to help our arts institutions is 
coming. 
Perhaps the thing that we are the 
most proud of—although there are so 
many in this bill—is helping people 
with their pensions and making sure 
those 
who 
are 
laid 
off 
still 
get 
healthcare by funding COBRA fully. 
There are so many good things for 
average working families, but maybe 
the most important of all—who knows? 
There are so many good things in this 
bill—is the child tax credit, which will 
cut childhood poverty in half. When a 
child is born into poverty at no fault of 
his or her own, they don’t get adequate 
nutrition. They don’t get adequate 
healthcare. They don’t get adequate 
housing. They don’t get adequate edu-
cation. Then, when they get to young 
adulthood, they have nowhere to go, 
and then they get blamed for their 
plight. The better, smarter, more effec-
tive thing to do is to help them get out 
of poverty early so they can lead good, 
productive lives as citizens and as tax-
payers. We are doing that for the first 
time here, and I hope it is something 
that we can continue. 
Simply put, the American Rescue 
Plan is one of the most significant 
pieces of legislation to pass the Con-
gress in recent history. 
Yesterday, I started describing in 
more detail some of the lesser known 
aspects of the plan. Everyone knows 
that vaccines are coming, that $1,400 
checks are coming, that money for 
schools is coming, and now people 
know of the child tax credit, but there 
are lots of other things in this bill. 
Today, I want to continue by talking 
about another unheralded provision: 
assistance to Native communities. It is 
a topic very much on theme today 
given the nomination of Secretary 
HAALAND. 
One of the most tragic features of the 
COVID–19 pandemic is how destructive 
it has been for America’s Tribal na-
tions. Native Americans have faced the 
highest risk of infections, hospitaliza-
tions, and deaths due to COVID–19—bar 
none, the highest. Early in the crisis, 
the Navajo Nation, to take one exam-
ple, saw more cases per capita than any 
other State in the country. Decades of 
an unraveling social safety net, declin-
ing economic opportunity, an overbur-
dened health system, and the failure of 
the Federal Government to honor its 
trust obligations to American Tribes 
left Native communities unequipped to 
handle the crisis. But in the American 
Rescue Plan, the Democrats will de-
liver the single largest investment in 
Native communities in our Nation’s 
history. We are very proud of that. It is 
historic—the single largest investment 
in Native communities in our Nation’s 
history. More than $31.2 billion in di-
rect funding will go to Tribes and com-
munities to defeat this pandemic and 
rebuild their communities; $20 billion 
directly to Tribal governments so they 
can stabilize essential services; $6 bil-
lion to the Indian Health Service, not 
just for vaccines and testing and trac-
ing but to improve and restore these 
rural, long-neglected hospitals; hun-
dreds of millions more for Native edu-
cation; $10 million will go to just mak-
ing sure communities can access clean 
water. 
Listen to the items I just mentioned: 
clean water, keeping hospitals running, 
connecting kids to broadband. These 
are absolute necessities, and the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan is going to dedicate 
resources to all of them for Indian 
Country. 
I want to thank a whole bunch of my 
colleagues. So many contributed, but 
the chair of the Indian Affairs Com-
mittee, Senator SCHATZ, and Senators 
TESTER and CANTWELL and SMITH and 
KELLY and BEN RAY LUJA´ N and Hein-
rich are very, very important. Senator 
HEINRICH
particularly 
pushed 
for 
broadband. So it was a team effort, and 
I am proud of my colleagues. 
The American Rescue Plan takes us a 
giant step closer to fulfilling our trust 
responsibilities to all Native Ameri-
cans, Alaska Natives, and Native Ha-
waiians. This is just one example, an 
important one, as to how the rescue 
plan will dramatically improve the 
lives of millions of people in this great 
country of ours.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
a year ago, coronavirus cases were be-
ginning to climb on U.S. soil. Shut-
down measures were starting to take 
effect. 
Americans have endured one of the 
strangest and most painful years in liv-
ing memory. Nearly 2 million Ameri-
cans have been hospitalized with seri-
ous cases of the virus. More than half a 
million have lost their lives. Millions 
of students and workers have had their 
lives completely thrown off course. But 
these dark times have also spotlighted 
some of the best of America: heroism, 
selflessness, ingenuity. 
Last March, the night we passed the 
CARES Act without a single dissenting 
vote, I said we would see a new genera-
tion of American heroes, and so we 
have. Doctors and nurses and first re-
sponders have worked tirelessly to help 
their 
fellow 
Americans. 
Essential 
workers kept manning their posts and 
prevented economic collapse. Neigh-
bors looked out for neighbors, and 
small businesses shifted gears almost 
overnight. Children and parents have 
fought to adapt to extraordinary dis-
ruptions, and incredible heroes in lab 
coats 
in 
America 
and 
worldwide 
worked at light speed to decode this 
new enemy and create lifesaving vac-
cines in record time. 
Today, together, we are standing on 
the cusp of a new springtime for our

country not like anything we have ex-
perienced in our lifetimes. More than 
95 million vaccine doses have reached 
American arms; another 2 million 
every single day. COVID-related deaths 
have plummeted, now less than half of 
their high, particularly for the elderly 
and the vulnerable. Science reaffirms 
kids can be safely in the classroom 
right now. States are starting to lift 
blanket restrictions, freeing citizens 
and small businesses to follow smart 
precautions themselves. For weeks, 
every indicator has suggested our econ-
omy is poised to come roaring back, 
with more job openings for Americans 
who need work. 
None of these trends began on Janu-
ary 20. President Biden and his Demo-
cratic government inherited a tide that 
had already begun to turn toward deci-
sive victory. 
In 2020, Congress passed five historic 
bipartisan bills to save our health sys-
tem, protect our economic foundations, 
and fund Operation Warp Speed to find 
vaccines. Senate Republicans led the 
bipartisan CARES Act that got our 
country through the last year. 
The American people already built 
the parade that has been marching to-
ward victory; Democrats just want to 
sprint in front of the parade and claim 
credit. 
So when 10 Republican Senators went 
to the White House to suggest working 
together, the Democrats said: Uh, no. 
Both the Democratic leader and the 
White House Chief of Staff now indi-
cate they think President Obama’s 
problem was that he was too bipar-
tisan. 
This time, as one journalist put it, 
the situation was ‘‘Democrats to GOP: 
Take it or leave it.’’ The ‘‘it’’ that we 
are talking about here was a bill that 
only spent about 1 percent on vaccines 
and about 9 percent on the entire 
health fight. The rest of the tab went 
to things like this: a $350 billion bail-
out for State and local budgets unre-
lated to pandemic needs, with strings 
attached to stop States from cutting 
taxes on their own citizens down the 
road—take the money, you don’t get to 
cut taxes; massive Federal school fund-
ing spread over several years, without 
requiring quickly reopening; sweeping 
new government benefits with no work 
requirements whatsoever—a time warp 
to the bad times before bipartisan wel-
fare reform—which Democrats already 
say they want to make permanent; and 
agricultural assistance conditioned not 
on specific financial need but solely on 
the demographics of the farmer, which 
some liberal activists are celebrating 
as ‘‘reparations.’’ Only about 20 per-
cent of the spending went to $1,400 di-
rect checks, to try to keep all of the 
unrelated socialism out of the spot-
light. 
This wasn’t a bill to finish off the 
pandemic; it was a multitrillion-dollar 
Trojan horse full of bad, old liberal 
ideas. President Biden’s own staff keep 
calling this legislation ‘‘the most pro-
gressive bill in American history’’— 
hardly the commonsense bipartisan-
ship that the President promised. 
So we pause today at the 1-year mark 
to remember and to mourn, but we also 
look with great optimism toward the 
future. Twenty twenty-one is set to be 
a historic comeback year, not because 
of the far-left legislation that was 
passed after the tide had already 
turned but because of the resilience of 
the American people. 
(Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.) 
f 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a completely different matter, 
at noon today, the Senate will vote on 
whether to pluck the Becerra nomina-
tion out of committee after it failed to 
garner enough support to advance. 
Every one of President Biden’s nomi-
nations the Senate has considered so 
far has received bipartisan support for 
confirmation. There is a reason Mr. 
Becerra could not get one single Re-
publican vote to move out of com-
mittee. It is because he is such a thor-
oughly partisan actor with so little 
subject-matter expertise and such a 
demonstrated history of hostility to-
ward basic values like the freedom of 
conscience. There is nothing about Mr. 
Becerra’s record in Congress or in Cali-
fornia to suggest he is the best possible 
person to run the Department of 
Health and Human Services in the mid-
dle of a once-in-a-generation viral pan-
demic—not even close. 
This is too important a job at too im-
portant a time for this administration 
to put raw partisanship ahead of quali-
fications. So I would strongly urge all 
Senators to vote against rescuing this 
nomination from committee. Let’s give 
the President the opportunity to make 
a better selection. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARY SUIT JONES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on one final matter, as I have 
mentioned, it is customary for some 
top Senate staff positions to see new 
faces 
when 
party 
control 
changes 
hands. 
Today, it is my honor to pay tribute 
to Mary Suit Jones, a huge asset to 
this institution who has become an in-
stitution herself. 
Tomorrow, Mary will finish her sec-
ond separate run as Assistant Sec-
retary of the Senate and conclude a 
Senate career that has spanned more 
than a quarter of a century. 
I first met Mary Jones in the mid- 
1990s when we brought her on board to 
help manage my office. Neither I nor 
Mary’s colleagues back then could have 
predicted that nearly 30 years later, 
she would depart as one of the most 
senior officers in the entire place. But 
the truth is, if you had told us, nobody 
would have been even a little surprised 
either. 
I have entrusted Mary with a lot of 
different 
responsibilities 
over 
the 
years. She served as our office manager 
just a few years out of college. She 
came with me to the Rules Committee, 
first as deputy staff director and then 
the top job. Senator Frist had the good 
judgment to ask her to be Assistant 
Secretary in the early 2000s. Then she 
returned to Rules and resumed serving 
as our staff director under Senators 
Bob Bennett, Lamar Alexander, and 
then Pat Roberts. Finally, she gener-
ously brought all of this expertise and 
institutional knowledge back to the 
Assistant Secretary role 6 years ago. 
In her first job in my office, Mary or-
ganized one team of people and our in-
frastructure. In her current job, she 
has overseen 26 departments and scores 
of Senate staff, pushing resources and 
guidance down and pushing informa-
tion up. In between, at Rules, she tack-
led things like helping run Presidential 
inaugurations. 
Through it all, I cannot name one 
time when Mary Jones did not deliver. 
She is consistent, competent, and com-
pletely reliable. No wonder her name 
has become a kind of catchphrase 
around the Senate when anyone is try-
ing to track down some key piece of 
wisdom or is puzzling over how to get 
something done: ‘‘Well, let’s ask Mary 
Jones.’’ ‘‘Have you checked with Mary 
Jones?’’ ‘‘I think Mary knows all about 
that.’’ 
Everyone from junior staff to senior 
Senators, Republicans and Democrats, 
have been able to count on Mary for ex-
pertise and execution. On a million dif-
ferent subjects, she knows the answer 
to the question you are going to ask 
before you even finish asking it. A 
rock-solid administrator, a consum-
mate professional—she is just that 
good. 
So I am sorry to see Mary depart the 
Senate, but she has given generously to 
this place. She has certainly earned the 
opportunity to apply her many talents 
to some new challenges and perhaps 
knock a few miles off of her famously 
epic commute while she is at it. 
The whole Senate thanks Mary for 
her excellent service. We wish her, her 
husband, and their kids all the best in 
the exciting new chapters that lie 
ahead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1480 
March 11, 2021 
General Xavier Becerra to head the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
As chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, I am going to begin with a sim-
ple message: Holding up the nomina-
tion of Attorney General Becerra has 
been blocking urgent anti-virus work 
that needs to get done now. So it is 
time for the Senate to act quickly, 
without politics getting in the way, to 
confirm this nominee. 
I also believe moving quickly on this 
nomination will help to achieve some-
thing I heard a lot of Senators talk 
about over the last few days. 
A few days ago, I spent almost 24 
hours here at this desk while the Sen-
ate was debating a number of different 
issues. Over the course of that debate 
and in the weeks before it, many Sen-
ators talked about how important it 
was to get past some of the long-
standing disagreements and find unity. 
I will say to my colleagues: There 
could not be a more unifying prospect 
for America than ending this public 
health nightmare as quickly as pos-
sible, preventing as many COVID–19 
deaths as possible, and helping the 
American people get back to the ac-
tivities that they enjoy, that they con-
sider part of their normal daily rou-
tine. 
Having a confirmed Secretary lead-
ing the Department of Health and 
Human Services is a linchpin for ac-
complishing that task. The Depart-
ment is right at the effort, at the fore-
front, to end this contagion. It is lead-
ing the distribution of vaccines. It is 
working to get PPE into the hands of 
nurses and doctors who still—still— 
desperately need more of it. It is get-
ting new resources to rural hospitals to 
keep them afloat and to keep their 
doors open to patients who literally 
had nowhere else to go during this cri-
sis. 
Health and Human Services is right 
in the center of the government-wide 
COVID response. They coordinate work 
at the Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services, with the Centers for 
Disease Control, with the National In-
stitutes of Health, with the National 
Guard, with all 50 States, with the Dis-
trict 
of 
Columbia, 
with 
private 
healthcare systems and doctors across 
the country and more individuals and 
organizations that are just too numer-
ous to name. Now, that is what the job 
is all about and why it is so critical 
right now. 
I want to turn to some of what I have 
heard discussed with respect to Attor-
ney General Becerra. I have heard some 
say that, well, he doesn’t have the 
right leadership experience. That is a 
comment being made about the head of 
America’s second largest department of 
justice. This nominee is in charge of a 
billion-dollar budget. This nominee is 
in charge of more than 4,000 employees 
as the top law enforcement official in 
what would be the fifth largest econ-
omy in the world. This is the work of 
somebody who really knows how to run 
a mammoth government agency. 
Then there have been suggestions 
about his healthcare background. This 
is one that, to me, is just bizarre, given 
the track record. He spent years and 
years on the House Ways and Means 
Committee, which is one of the key 
committees in the country with re-
spect to jurisdiction over healthcare 
policy. He wrote and debated major 
pieces of healthcare legislation, includ-
ing playing an important role in the 
development of the Affordable Care 
Act. As California’s attorney general, 
he defended the Affordable Care Act in 
court. When the pandemic hit, he 
stepped up and fought to protect the 
health and well-being of millions of 
Californians, particularly nurses and 
doctors and other workers who found 
themselves in harm’s way. 
When one is in the Senate, you un-
derstand that Members of the opposing 
party are going to have disagreements 
on policy issues. That goes with the 
turf. Women’s healthcare was obvi-
ously one of those issues that came up 
during the nomination hearing. 
I will tell you that Attorney General 
Becerra’s response is what we ought to 
expect of responsible public officials 
and of nominees. He made it clear to 
members of the Finance Committee. 
He said again and again and again that 
he will follow the law. He will be acces-
sible to all Senators. He is going to 
work to find common ground on key 
healthcare issues. 
I can tell you, having specialized in 
healthcare since my days with the Or-
egon Gray Panthers, that is heavy lift-
ing. By the way, I think it is pretty re-
freshing after 4 years of just blather 
about repeal-and-replace and empty 
rhetoric and promises on pharma-
ceutical price-gouging and partisan 
policies that favor insurance compa-
nies over the typical American con-
sumers. 
In 
my 
view, 
Attorney 
General 
Becerra proved in his nomination hear-
ing that he knows healthcare policy in-
side and out and that he is ready to 
lead the Department of Health and 
Human Services. I don’t think anybody 
ought to be particularly surprised be-
cause he has a decades-long track 
record in healthcare leadership and 
policy experience that is going to help 
him succeed in the job. 
We all understand the country’s 
healthcare system is still under ex-
traordinary pressure and strain. On 
Saturday, the Senate passed one of the 
largest public health packages in our 
country’s history, designed to crush 
this pandemic. So we are starting to 
see some light. We are starting to see 
the end of the tunnel. The Biden ad-
ministration is doing everything it can 
to acquire more vaccines, to get more 
shots into arms. I think we all under-
stand it is not a task completed yet. 
I will just close by way of saying that 
when our country faces a healthcare 
crisis, it needs a Secretary of Health 
and Human Services confirmed and on 
the job as soon as possible. It doesn’t 
need more political games and delay 
that only sets back our effort to end 
the pandemic. 
So we will be voting, I believe, in less 
than an hour, and I just want to say 
that I hope colleagues will support this 
nomination discharged from the Fi-
nance Committee. I have known the at-
torney general for a number of years. 
As I say, this is the area that I have 
specialized in over the years. And I 
know that Senators have differences of 
opinion with respect to healthcare. I 
get that. But those differences of opin-
ion shouldn’t stand in the way of a 
qualified public official who has man-
aged thousands of people in his current 
job, for example, from having the op-
portunity to do what has to be done for 
this country, and that is to get a con-
firmed nominee for a critical position 
so that he can attack those challenges 
that are in front of us right now and 
help patients and speed up the efforts 
to end the pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I voted 
for a number of President Biden’s 
nominees—his nominee for Treasury 
Secretary, for Defense Secretary, for 
Attorney General, for Director of Na-
tional 
Intelligence, 
for 
Agriculture 
Secretary, 
and 
others. 
These 
can-
didates were not the ones I would have 
picked if I were President, but I believe 
it is important for our country that 
our President have a team in place. 
As long as a President’s nominees 
aren’t raising serious concerns, I think 
a President of either party is entitled 
to have the people he or she chooses 
serving in his or her administration, 
but by the same token, if a President’s 
nominee does raise serious concerns, I 
think we have a responsibility as Sen-
ators to oppose him or her. Today, I 
rise to oppose the President’s nominee 
to head the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
A number of President Biden’s nomi-
nees have been qualified, mainstream 
candidates. Xavier Becerra is not a 
mainstream candidate. He is an ex-
tremist who has used the offices he has 
held to advance an aggressively pro- 
abortion agenda and to target religious 
liberty and freedom of conscience. Mr. 
Becerra does not represent the views of 
the majority of Americans; he rep-
resents the views of the radical, pro- 
abortion wing of the Democratic Party. 
The Planned Parenthood wing of the 
Democratic Party would like Ameri-
cans to believe that unrestricted abor-
tion on demand up to the moment of 
birth is a no-brainer, an unqualified 
good, but the truth is, despite decades 
of trying to convince Americans of 
this, Americans simply don’t agree.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1481 
March 11, 2021 
Just 29 percent of Americans believe 
that abortion should be legal in all cir-
cumstances. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
Americans believe that abortion should 
either be illegal or that there should be 
at least some restrictions, undoubtedly 
because on some level, every American 
is aware that when we talk about abor-
tion, we are talking about killing a 
human being. Mr. Becerra, on the other 
hand, does not seem to support any re-
strictions on abortion. If he does, I 
would sure like to hear about them. 
As a Congressman, he earned perfect 
ratings from Planned Parenthood and 
NARAL. He assembled an overwhelm-
ingly pro-abortion voting record, even 
opposing a ban on partial-birth abor-
tion—a procedure so heinous and repul-
sive, it is difficult to even describe. 
As California attorney general, he 
aggressively crusaded in favor of abor-
tion. He is known for defending Califor-
nia’s law forcing crisis pregnancy cen-
ters to advertise abortion—a case he 
lost at the Supreme Court on First 
Amendment grounds. But his activities 
were hardly limited to California abor-
tion law. This was not a case of an at-
torney general simply defending the 
laws of their own State. No. As Cali-
fornia attorney general, Mr. Becerra 
repeatedly—repeatedly—inserted him-
self into abortion debates in other 
States. He joined other attorneys gen-
eral to file amicus briefs challenging 
abortion laws in Missouri, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, and other States, and he 
frequently led these efforts himself—a 
fact he proudly highlighted in press re-
leases. 
Mr. Becerra’s extremist views on 
abortion would be enough of a red flag, 
but to that we have to add Mr. 
Becerra’s record on religious liberty 
and freedom of conscience—most fa-
mously his efforts to force religious 
people, including nuns, to offer health 
insurance benefits that violate their 
religious beliefs. 
At a Finance Committee hearing, Mr. 
Becerra tried to downplay his actions 
in this case. ‘‘I never sued [an order of] 
nuns,’’ he claimed. ‘‘I have [sued] the 
federal government.’’ Well, that is an 
answer only a lawyer could love. Yes, 
he didn’t sue nuns; he sued the Federal 
Government to force nuns and other re-
ligious people to offer health insurance 
benefits that violate their consciences. 
That was the aim of his lawsuit—to 
force nuns and other religious Ameri-
cans to act contrary to their con-
sciences. 
When an order of nuns, the Little 
Sisters of the Poor, joined the case in 
an effort to ensure their right to live 
according to their faith was protected, 
Mr. Becerra apparently had no hesi-
tation in continuing his suit. 
Mr. Becerra’s extremist views on 
abortion and his record on religious 
liberty would be troubling in any nomi-
nee, but they would matter a lot less if 
we were talking about a nominee for, 
say, Secretary of Transportation. But 
that is not what we are talking about. 
We are talking about putting Mr. 
Becerra in charge of a Cabinet Depart-
ment entrusted with interpreting and 
applying laws protecting religious free-
dom and freedom of conscience. 
Nothing I have seen suggests to me 
that Mr. Becerra can be relied on to 
provide robust protection for these 
cherished rights. In fact, I am pro-
foundly concerned that Mr. Becerra 
would use his office to limit Ameri-
cans’ religious freedom. Under Mr. 
Becerra’s HHS, are nuns going to be 
forced to offer health insurance bene-
fits that violate their religious faith? 
Will healthcare professionals be pro-
tected from having to perform proce-
dures, like abortions, that violate their 
consciences? 
Given Mr. Becerra’s record, I am con-
cerned about the answers to these 
questions. In fact, there is a reason to 
be concerned. A prime reason for nomi-
nating Mr. Becerra was his radical 
abortion advocacy and his attacks on 
religious liberty. 
It is difficult to find another reason 
for nominating Mr. Becerra during a 
global health emergency. Mr. Becerra 
is not a doctor. He has not worked in 
the healthcare field. He is not a virol-
ogist or a vaccine expert. He does not 
have a background in public health. It 
is not unreasonable to conclude that 
his appeal to the abortion left, one of 
the most powerful interest groups in 
the Democrat Party, was a prime rea-
son for his nomination. 
NARAL and Planned Parenthood cer-
tainly give credence to that idea with 
their enthusiastic statements in sup-
port of Mr. Becerra, which highlighted 
his aggressive abortion advocacy. I also 
have to say that it is pretty interesting 
to nominate someone to head HHS 
who, in his last job, proudly sued HHS 
repeatedly. 
I know that President Biden is a man 
of faith, but he is doing a great dis-
service to people of faith and to the 
First Amendment with this nomina-
tion. He is also doing a disservice to 
the American people by nominating a 
candidate whose views on abortion are 
so radical and so out of step with the 
views of most Americans. 
Days ago, three of my Democrat col-
leagues broke ranks with their party to 
stand up for the many, many Ameri-
cans who don’t want their tax dollars 
going to pay for abortions. I urge them 
and all of my colleagues to join me in 
opposing the nomination of Xavier 
Becerra. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
REOPENING SCHOOLS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, we 
have got an issue in this country re-
lated to the pandemic but, more spe-
cifically, related to children not going 
back to school. And one thing that is of 
incredible concern is it appears that 
the Biden administration, which cam-
paigned saying that they were going to 
follow science—alleging that the pre-
vious administration was not—seems 
not to be following science but to prej-
udice their recommendations to fit a 
political agenda. 
With that, let me develop my case. 
The harms of prolonged closure to 
school children are remarkable. They 
are well known. It has been up to a 
year since the schools have been 
closed, and in the Presiding Officer’s 
home State of California, there are 
some school systems that are still not 
reopened. 
Now, think about this: Places where 
children go, not just to learn but to 
have social workers make sure they 
aren’t being abused at home, a dietary 
staff to make sure they have adequate 
nutrition—but also to learn—have been 
closed for a year. 
Now, we can say: Wait a second, don’t 
worry about that because the children 
have been given remote learning. There 
is ample data which shows that par-
ticularly the children from lower in-
come families are not logging on even 
when they are given a broadband com-
puter—given an internet-equipped com-
puter to take home or given WiFi ac-
cess to use at home. We can imagine it. 
Mom has to work. There is no one to 
supervise the child, so the 7-year-old is 
home by herself while mom is working. 
We can also imagine that a family 
does not have a culture of being online. 
We can imagine a big family of seven 
or eight kids where things just kind of 
get lost in the shuffle, and there is not 
enough room for someone to be by 
themselves. Whatever, it is established 
that there are kids being left behind by 
not being in the classroom, and those 
kids, disproportionately, are poor. And 
that is why the Biden administration’s 
pledge to follow science resonated, and 
that is why early indications that they 
are not is not just disappointing, it is a 
betrayal—and not a betrayal of a cam-
paign pledge, a betrayal of those chil-
dren who are at home. 
Now, by the way, data shows that 
children can safely go back to school. 
There was a CDC study from January 
of 2021 finding little evidence of virus 
spread in a school setting when the rec-
ommended precautions were taken, 
which kind of calls them—and, by the 
way, there is a recent study by the fol-
lowing 
doctors—Henderson, 
Gandhi, 
Hoeg, and Johnson from universities 
such as the University of Chicago, UC 
Davis, and UC San Francisco—showing 
how safe it is to go to school, not get 
infected, and social distancing as mini-
mal as 3 feet distant one from the 
other—OK, just 3 feet distant. 
Now, that is important because if 
you say you can’t bring kids back to 
school because you don’t have enough 
classroom space for smaller classes, it 
is one thing if you say there must be 6 
feet between each child and another if 
there only needs to be 3 feet. So these 
doctors from these prestigious univer-
sities found you only need 3 feet. 
That begs the question: Why did the 
Centers for Disease Control, in their 
February 26 document, say that 6 feet 
was needed? Now, you may say: 6 feet, 
3 feet, why does it make a difference?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1482 
March 11, 2021 
Because schools aren’t reopening, and 
their excuse is they need 6 feet between 
students. They are finding a reason to 
keep kids at home not learning—a spu-
rious reason. 
The doctors who wrote this paper 
just put an editorial in USA Today in a 
nice quote here. I say ‘‘nice.’’ It kind of 
summarizes. It is disappointing that 
they have to say this. It is that—they 
open up with ‘‘The only thing we have 
to fear is fear itself,’’ which is a quote 
from Franklin Roosevelt. But they go 
on to say—they speak up for lost 
wages, for families, and the poverty 
and eviction that this is resulting in 
but that the research says there is 
greater risk to life expectancies with 
schools closed versus schools open, but 
they then ask that we overcome fear 
by following the science. And the 
science says we can safely reopen our 
schools now—full-time, nonhybrid—and 
keep them open. Unfortunately, that is 
not what the Centers for Disease Con-
trol is saying. 
Now, by the way, there is a clear 
agenda here. Part of the agenda is that 
teachers unions in certain commu-
nities have not wanted to reopen. They 
are more concerned about the union 
than they are about the children. So 
whether it is a Democratic mayor of 
Chicago trying to force the teachers 
union in Chicago to reopen, whether it 
is Los Angeles or San Diego, which are 
still 
not 
reopened, 
with 
teachers 
unions objecting to reopening there, 
this is not based upon science, not 
based upon risk to the teachers or the 
children. They would just rather not be 
at work. Isn’t that amazing? 
Now, let me tell you who has been 
open. First, in Louisiana, over 75 per-
cent of our schools have reopened. Hats 
off to my State. Private and parochial 
schools have been open. Hats off to 
them. They are kind of the business 
model: If you don’t get paid, you show 
up for work. They show up for work. So 
let’s give a hats off. 
And that is why there should be 
school choice. If a parent can’t get 
their child educated in Los Angeles, in 
San Diego, or in Chicago, then why are 
we keeping that child from going to a 
private school? ‘‘Oh, they can go,’’ you 
say. Not if they are poor. If they are 
poor, they don’t have the revenue. 
We should take the money that we 
are giving to those public schools that 
will not open because the teachers 
unions oppose it and give it to the par-
ents so their children can go to a 
school where their children will actu-
ally be educated, and the fact that we 
don’t do that is politics over what is 
best for that child. It is a betrayal of 
those children. 
This 
administration’s 
policy, 
4 
months 
into 
their 
4 
years, 
dem-
onstrates betrayal after betrayal after 
betrayal. Let’s safely reopen schools 
now. We know we can do so. We knew 
that a year ago. The science and the 
data show it. Congress had provided $68 
billion before this latest bill in order to 
make sure we had everything we need-
ed in order to do that. A lack of fund-
ing has not been an excuse to reopen. 
What is clear is a lack of will, and I 
will repeat where I started: This ad-
ministration is betraying the most vul-
nerable children in our country. Re-
open schools now. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have to tell you, you can always tell 
how controversial a nominee is by how 
fast his supporters work to finish the 
confirmation process, and last night, at 
6:12, we found out that the Democrats 
tried to pull a fast one on Xavier 
Becerra’s nomination. They were try-
ing to fast-track this, and I was able to 
object to that hotline request, but the 
fact that they tried it shows that they 
are worried about this nominee, and 
they should be. After two unimpressive 
hearings and seeing the split vote on 
the Finance Committee, I think my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
have come to realize that his lack of 
experience in the healthcare sector is 
one of those big things. 
You 
know, 
we 
have 
over 
400 
healthcare companies in Tennessee and 
tens of thousands of employees in that 
sector. They all—each and every one of 
them—have more healthcare experi-
ence than the Biden administration’s 
nominee for Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. 
His greatest hits from his job keep 
coming back to haunt him, and as 
much as his allies here in the Senate 
try to spin his record, they just can’t 
seem to convince people that he is fit 
to lead. I was curious how wide the di-
vide is between Tennesseeans and the 
Becerra nomination, so I asked my 
staff to look through our mailbag and 
see what people were calling and writ-
ing about. 
This nomination was in the top five 
issues of concern. People in Tennessee 
are 
not 
happy. 
As 
I 
mentioned, 
healthcare, 
our 
religious 
organiza-
tions—what they are seeing is some-
body who has crossed the line too 
many times. They do not see him as fit 
to lead. 
His 
lack 
of 
experience 
in 
the 
healthcare industry explains why so 
many people would oppose him. He 
thinks it would be a good idea to take 
private health insurance away from 160 
million Americans and throw them 
into a disastrous single-payer system. 
If that is what you want, then he would 
be a great Secretary of HHS for you. 
If he has his way, he will use his new 
position to further undermine our im-
migration laws. He has admitted—his 
own admission—that given the chance, 
he would decriminalize illegal entry 
and extend Medicaid benefits to anyone 
who manages to make it across the 
border. It is like winning the lottery. If 
you get across that border, we are 
going to give you healthcare benefits, 
courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. 
We cannot afford to keep confirming 
nominees who have zero respect for the 
rule of law—zero—and even less respect 
for the value of human life. Through-
out his career, Mr. Becerra has made 
his appallingly radical positions on 
abortion very well known. He is proud 
to support abortion up until the mo-
ment of birth. He even opposed the 2003 
partial-birth abortion ban. He defended 
a truly evil California law that forced 
pro-life crisis pregnancy centers to ad-
vertise abortion services offered by 
State-run clinics. 
Recently, a physician friend of mine 
made a comment about Mr. Becerra’s 
nomination that has really stuck with 
me. She said: 
I’m horrified— 
Bear in mind, this is a physician. 
I’m horrified by his position on abortion 
because he would abort a baby that I would 
resuscitate. He would abort a baby that a 
family is willing to adopt. 
Now, think about that. This is a guy, 
in his congressional career and in his 
job as the attorney general for Cali-
fornia, he is a radical on abortion—a 
radical. You have physicians who stand 
there to resuscitate these babies that 
have difficulty during birth. He would 
allow those babies to be aborted when 
a physician would choose life, would 
choose to help that baby live. 
According to Mr. Becerra, religious 
exemptions should be a thing of the 
past. He relentlessly harassed religious 
employers like Hobby Lobby and non-
profit organizations like the Little Sis-
ters of the Poor as part of his crusade 
to uphold ObamaCare’s contraception 
mandate. I think it is clear why the Fi-
nance Committee split their vote on 
this nomination. It has nothing to do 
with politics. 
Xavier Becerra’s obsession with dis-
mantling American society and re-
building it in his own image can’t be 
boiled down to a simple policy posi-
tion. Instead, it signals his desire to 
force Americans to live their lives ac-
cording to his twisted world view. 
He may have the approval of leftists, 
but the American people and thousands 
of Tennesseans have already written 
him off as radically unqualified, and, 
frankly, so have I. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
opposing this motion to discharge and 
opposing the nomination. He is radi-
cally anti-life, anti-religion, anti-bor-
der security, anti-free speech. He is un-
qualified to lead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
NOMINATION OF DEBRA ANNE HAALAND 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Montana 
has a rich outdoor heritage. It is some-
thing we are known for not just across 
the country but even around the world 
and something, as Montanans, we are 
very proud of. 
In fact, for generations, Montana 
families have enjoyed hunting, fishing, 
recreating on public lands. I myself am 
an avid outdoorsman. In fact, some of 
my fondest memories growing up in 
Montana are spending time with my

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1483 
March 11, 2021 
family, my dad, my mom, my grandpa 
hunting, fishing, backpacking in our 
State. And, thankfully, I have had a 
chance to pass it on to our own four 
children—something 
we 
still 
enjoy 
doing today, my wife and I, as we are 
now empty nesters. 
Recreation on public lands is part of 
our Montana way of life. It is how we 
raise our families in Montana. And just 
as we cherish our access to our public 
lands, we also value the conservation 
of our lands, as well as the stewardship 
of our vast natural resources. 
Energy development flourishes in 
Montana. It provides over 16,000 hard- 
working men and women with good- 
paying jobs to support their families, 
while funding conservation and pro-
tecting our landscapes and wildlife. 
Montana is still a State where hard- 
working moms and dads who work hard 
during the week are thankful for many 
jobs provided by the natural resources 
in our State. They work hard during 
the week, but on the weekends, they go 
down to Walmart, Bob Ward’s Sports’ 
warehouse, and Ace Sporting Goods 
store and buy an elk tag over the 
counter, a fishing license, and get into 
our public lands within 30 minutes of 
buying that license. That is uniquely 
part of our Montana experience. These 
jobs that we have in the natural re-
source industry, these energy jobs, are 
part of who we are as Montanans be-
cause we are a State full of diverse in-
terests, competing priorities, some-
times opposing philosophies. But time 
and again, stakeholders have come to-
gether to find balance and achieve our 
most lasting conservation wins. 
That is a word that is missing in 
Washington, DC, as we are seeing a new 
administration come to power; it is the 
word ‘‘balance.’’ You see, as Mon-
tanans, we are proud stewards of our 
beautiful landscapes, our rivers, our 
natural resources, and our wildlife. We 
take pride in following the science and 
listening to our local experts on the 
ground to do what is best for our envi-
ronment and our public lands, as well 
as our rural communities. 
And this legacy of balance is inter-
twined within the jurisdiction of the 
Department of the Interior. The Sec-
retary of the Interior oversees much of 
America’s lands, our water, wildlife, 
energy resources, and in many ways 
oversees our Montana way of life. Over 
the past few years, we have seen Secre-
taries of the Interior with a range of 
views—some I agree with, some I 
haven’t. But one thing was consistent, 
they were consensus builders. They 
were able to listen to the needs of di-
verse stakeholders, bring folks to-
gether, come up with a solution that 
worked for almost everybody. I would 
use the word ‘‘balance’’ again. 
Unfortunately, 
Representative 
HAALAND has a very well-documented 
and hostile record toward made-in- 
America energy, toward natural re-
source development, toward wildlife 
management, and sportsmen. Through-
out her tenure as a Congresswoman, 
Representative HAALAND
championed 
the Green New Deal. She advocated for 
the most extreme positions, including 
banning all fossil fuels. 
She cosponsored legislation to pro-
vide Federal protections for grizzly 
bears forever without considering the 
science that is very clear that supports 
delisting that species and returning it 
back to the States, just like we did 
with wolves back in 2011. 
She has been enthusiastic in her calls 
to stop not just the Keystone Pipeline 
but all pipelines, calling for a ban for 
all pipelines. She even protested the 
Dakota Access Pipeline herself. 
She 
has 
stated 
that 
trapping 
shouldn’t be allowed on public lands. 
And as noted by several sportsmen 
groups, Representative HAALAND would 
not even commit to maintaining cur-
rent access on our public lands during 
the hearing. I can tell you, these are 
not mainstream views held by most 
Montanans. 
I am not opposed to Representative 
HAALAND’s confirmation because she is 
a Democrat or because she was nomi-
nated by President Biden. In fact, I 
have supported many of the President’s 
nominees. This is about her record, her 
very far-left, divisive positions that 
will fail to represent the West, to be in 
the mainstream of common sense and 
balance. And I fear she will harm the 
Montana way of life as we know it. 
This is about protecting our Montana 
way of life, the ability to have a good- 
paying job during the week and enjoy-
ing our public lands on the weekends 
because if you kill the energy jobs, you 
kill all the pipelines, you kill our nat-
ural resources, Montana is left to be 
simply a playground for the rich and 
famous. We have to stand up for our 
hard-working Montanans and protect 
their way of life. 
This is about maintaining a common-
sense balance. We can develop our nat-
ural resources and protect our public 
lands at the same time. We can do 
both, and we must do both. 
So I urge my colleagues, especially 
those from Western States that hold 
many of these same values, to really 
think 
about 
what 
Representative 
HAALAND would bring to the Depart-
ment of the Interior as leader of that 
organization. I urge my colleagues to 
consider the impact this will have and 
to 
vote 
against 
Representative 
HAALAND’s nomination for Secretary of 
the Interior. 
I yield back my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
don’t plan to speak long, but listening 
to my colleagues, I just wanted to 
make a few points. 
Our former colleague, Representative 
Becerra, spent much time in the Con-
gress—I think 12 terms—much of that 
in a position focusing on healthcare 
policy as a member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. I say that because I 
know so many of our colleagues, par-
ticularly House Members, have gone on 
to run Agencies, run Departments, be 
Secretaries of Defense, and, basically, 
they just had some congressional expe-
rience in that policy area. 
So I am not sure why we are dis-
carding that important policy back-
ground, consideration, balancing of 
those issues, weighing in on parts of 
our constituencies, as Mr. Becerra did. 
And Mr. Becerra was the first His-
panic to be a member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. So I am pretty sure 
he brought forth a context to many of 
the healthcare policies. I know now 
that I bring a lot of focus on Native 
American issues to the Finance Com-
mittee because I represent so many Na-
tive Americans. 
I think Mr. Becerra represents some-
body who has a lot of healthcare expe-
rience and then, as attorney general, 
took on one of the biggest fights we 
need to have right now, which is the af-
fordability of prescription drug pricing 
and the shortages that I believe are ar-
tificially created on things like insulin 
and other drugs that are spiking out of 
control the healthcare prices for Amer-
icans. 
If you had to say, besides getting ac-
cess to affordable healthcare insur-
ance, what the second most important 
goal would be—or, actually, if you 
asked across the spectrum of millions 
of Americans—they would say it is the 
high cost of prescription drugs. And we 
have somebody who has taken on this 
battle and, basically, really under-
stands what we need to do as a nation 
in lowering prescription drug prices. 
So I just hope that people who are at 
home are listening. This is a unique in-
dividual who I think stands up truth to 
power many times in his career, and I 
think that we would be great if we 
have his vote and nomination out here 
on the Senate floor so the American 
people can hear more about the impor-
tant policies. 
If you want to vote against him be-
cause you don’t want the Affordable 
Care Act, well, that is your preroga-
tive. But if you want somebody who 
has just as much experience as any 
other Member of Congress who has 
gone on to run an Agency, I guarantee 
you he is as qualified, if not more 
qualified. 
So I hope our colleagues will vote yes 
on this motion to bring Xavier Becerra 
before the United States Senate. 
I thank the President. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF DEBRA ANNE HAALAND 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on Mon-
day, the Senate will vote on the nomi-
nation 
of 
Congresswoman 
DEB 
HAALAND to serve as Secretary of the 
Interior. I have had a chance to vote on 
a number of nominations over the 
years. I want to tell the Senate that, 
on Monday, the Senate can make his-
tory. 
The Congresswoman—and she faced 
some strong questioning in the com-
mittee—understands that protecting 
public lands and boosting rural com-
munities and jobs are two sides of the 
same coin. Too often, in the debates in 
Washington, DC, they really involve 
something resembling false choices. 
You can either be for jobs or you can 
be for protecting your treasures. The 
Congresswoman understands that those 
two are not mutually exclusive and 
that, in the West, particularly when 
you look at our exciting recreation 
economic engine, this is a chance to 
really generate more jobs, protect 
treasures, and enhance our quality of 
life. 
Now, I recognize that there have been 
powerful interest groups that try, for 
example, to protect the interests of big 
oil companies at taxpayer expense, at 
the expense of clean air and clean 
water, and, as I say, at the expense of 
everybody who wants to get outside. I 
know that part of the debate is prop-
ping up a dirty environmental policy 
and declining industry that, mostly, 
adds to the current climate crisis. 
In the long run, what we need to do 
is find fresh ways to bring Americans 
together around areas, particularly for 
rural communities, that are going to 
bridge the urban-rural divide, reduce

S1485 
March 11, 2021 
inequality in America, and be a long- 
term solution for rural economies. The 
Congresswoman, our nominee on Mon-
day, knows that there is a better way 
to protect and create rural jobs, and I 
will give you just one example. 
Congressman NEGUSE and I have in-
troduced a major piece of legislation to 
create the 21st Century Civilian Con-
servation Corps. Our legislation would 
create thousands of jobs in rural Amer-
ica, and these workers would help to 
preserve public lands and prevent the 
kind of massive wildfires America has 
seen in recent years. 
What I can say to colleagues is that 
a major effort like this will create 
scores and scores of jobs for local busi-
nesses and local vendors. Certainly, we 
are talking about the local hardware 
store, chainsaw outlets, and those who 
sell 
logging 
equipment. 
There 
are 
going to be lots of opportunities for 
private sector employment stemming 
from the arrival of the 21st Century Ci-
vilian Conservation Corps. We will also 
have a lot more opportunity for out-
door recreation, boosting tourism reve-
nues, and fewer communities reduced 
to ash by wildfire—a win all around. 
Now, the Congresswoman also talked 
to us about another priority for rural 
America, and that is helping Native 
American Tribes across the country 
build and repair drinking water infra-
structure and that she would make it a 
priority to help Tribes where there is a 
lack of drinking water, threatening the 
health of those Tribal members. This is 
especially a problem in Oregon, where-
in the Warm Springs Tribe has burst 
pipes and regular ‘‘boil water’’ notices, 
but I will tell you that Warm Springs 
is not alone in this country, and the 
Congresswoman understands. She said: 
Water is a basic human right. 
The next point that I want to touch 
on with respect to this exceptional 
Member of Congress is that she really 
has a track record of bringing parties 
together with differing views. Now, I 
know some Members of the Senate 
have gone to great lengths to say: Oh, 
she is some kind of far-out radical. 
Colleagues, that just doesn’t pass the 
smell test. She has been a leader in 
generating bipartisan support for ef-
forts in the House. She has one of the 
most conservative Members of the 
House singing her praises in coming be-
fore the committee, and I went several 
times just because I wanted to hear the 
Congresswoman address this crucial 
issue of how important rural jobs are, 
how rural jobs and protecting the envi-
ronment are not mutually exclusive, 
and how you can bring people together. 
On each of these points, she conveyed 
the kinds of views that make her an 
ideal choice for serving as the Sec-
retary of the Interior. 
I was also interested in her thoughts 
on a major piece of legislation for rural 
Eastern Oregon. It is the Malheur 
County 
Owyhee 
legislation, 
which 
seeks to resolve differences in this ex-
traordinary part of my State, the 
Owyhees—differences that have lit-
erally gone on for decades. We brought 
together ranchers and Tribes and envi-
ronmental folks, and we said: Here 
again, what we can do is create rural 
employment. We can protect the ag 
economy and the farmer’s way of life. 
We can also create great opportunities 
for recreation in that part of the State. 
The Congresswoman got it in a second. 
She said that is exactly what we need 
to do—build models that bring farmers 
and ranchers together with environ-
mental folks and scientists who under-
stand the nature of some of these chal-
lenges from a scientific and climate 
standpoint. 
I will tell you that I have gone to 
more than my share of nomination 
hearings, but what I saw was a nominee 
with exceptional backbone and de-
cency, who was being clear, being 
straightforward. At times, it was a lit-
tle hard to take because the ques-
tioning, I thought, was not just strong 
but over the line. At the same time, 
the Congresswoman showed her calm, 
her knowledge, and her perseverance in 
the face of this. 
I am just going to close with this. 
Colleagues, I have tried to kind of 
make my calling card a public service 
of bringing people together, finding 
fresh ideas, and the very kinds of ap-
proaches 
that 
the 
Congresswoman 
talked about during two, I felt, very 
draining kinds of sessions. My view is 
that it is critical for the Senate to be 
able to recognize there are going to be 
disagreements. The Senate is made up 
of a lot of people with very strong 
views, and what I believe we ought to 
insist on of all candidates is a level of 
decency and respect for all concerned. 
The Congresswoman showed that in the 
face of some very strong questioning. 
When I was done, I said: Not only am 
I going to support you because of your 
views on rural jobs and your recog-
nizing that protecting jobs and the en-
vironment are not mutually exclu-
sive—that we can do both—but because 
of your track record of bipartisanship, 
featuring Congressman YOUNG’s com-
ing here. 
Also, I come to the floor of the U.S. 
Senate to say that I was there for both 
sessions, and I saw an elected official, a 
Congresswoman, handle a lot of very 
tough, strong questions, and at every 
level, she tried to stick to the facts. 
She tried to make the case for what 
she thought was a great opportunity, 
especially in the West, but that she 
would be in all of the communities that 
the Department of the Interior is re-
sponsible for and that everyone would 
get a fair shake. Every Democrat and 
every Republican would get a fair 
shake. 
That is the kind of fundamental de-
cency we want in a nominee. 
And I will close with this: It sure 
stands in sharp contrast to what we 
saw over the last 4 years, two Secre-
taries, essentially, infamous rather 
than famous, who too often were will-
ing to set aside the science and support 
the powerful and those who were going 
to walk away making quick dollars at 
the expense of the environment. 
People of this country now have a 
chance, almost like you take a dilapi-
dated stage out of an auditorium, and 
now we have got a chance to start 
anew. We have got a nominee who is 
qualified. She is fair. She is going to 
concentrate on bringing people to-
gether, and she is going to make his-
tory. 
It is long, long, long past time, col-
leagues, that this country had a Native 
American leading the Interior Depart-
ment. 
So I pledge after that second hearing, 
I am going to come back on the floor 
and not just vote for her but speak for 
her because her decency, her thought-
fulness—I see my friend from New Mex-
ico here—that sense of caring and that 
fairness in the face of some very, very 
aggressive questioning makes me feel 
that this is a very special sort of lead-
er. 
Congresswoman HAALAND
has my 
full, unqualified support, and west-
erners are looking forward very much 
to working with her, get her to Oregon, 
and see what our challenges are. 
I urge all Members of the Senate on 
Monday to support the historic nomi-
nation of Congresswoman HAALAND to 
head the Interior Department. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mrs. 
LUMMIS. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
thank Senator DAINES for his leader-
ship on this issue. 
The only thing the previous speaker 
and I have in common is agreeing that 
it is high time that we had a Native 
American woman to lead the Depart-
ment of the Interior. 
On behalf of the people of Wyoming, 
I am opposing President Biden’s nomi-
nation of Congresswoman HAALAND to 
serve as Secretary of the Interior. 
As Secretary, she will continue the 
job-killing, anti-energy attack on Wyo-
ming’s livelihood that President Biden 
started during his first week in office. 
Let’s recap just how bad President 
Biden’s Executive actions are for my 
State. 
A University of Wyoming analysis 
found that Wyoming stands to lose 
nearly $13 billion in tax revenue if we 
don’t lift the Biden ban on new oil and 
gas leasing and drilling on Federal 
lands. To put this in context, $13 bil-
lion in tax revenue would educate 
60,000 Wyoming students from kinder-
garten through high school graduation. 
It would fund the University of Wyo-
ming for the next 59 years. It would 
fund our public safety and corrections 
budget for the next 68 years. And it 
would fund the Wyoming Department 
of Health for the next 26 years. These 
are real numbers, and the Biden ban is 
having real consequences. 
In Wyoming, we put the tax revenue 
from Federal land leases to use edu-
cating our kids, caring for the sick, 
and funding public infrastructure. 
Maybe this sounds like my complaint 
is just with President Biden. That is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1486 
March 11, 2021 
how Congresswoman HAALAND
would 
have 
you 
see 
it. 
Congresswoman 
HAALAND says that she will simply be 
following the administration’s orders 
and implementing its agenda at the In-
terior Department. This isn’t exactly 
encouraging for a number of reasons. 
The White House’s very first action 
in implementing their climate change 
agenda is on track to cost my home 
State a whopping $13 billion in rev-
enue. I shudder to think what their 
next action will cost us, especially 
with Department heads committed to 
blindly enacting the Biden agenda 
without consideration for the extraor-
dinary impacts it will continue to have 
on energy States like Wyoming. 
Second, Secretaries have an incred-
ible amount of power to make deci-
sions on how an administration’s agen-
da gets implemented. Based on her own 
public statements and actions, Con-
gresswoman HAALAND is more radical 
in her positions than President Biden. 
None of these facts are particularly 
encouraging to folks in Wyoming and 
the West who will be devastated by the 
policies that Congresswoman HAALAND 
plans to champion. What we need is a 
Secretary who understands the issues 
that westerners face. We need someone 
who knows the ways that States like 
Wyoming are contributing to Amer-
ica’s energy independence and doing so 
in increasingly environmentally friend-
ly ways. Banning permitting on Fed-
eral lands in Wyoming means banning 
access to 68 percent of Wyoming’s min-
erals. For our State and our country to 
remain energy independent, we need 
someone at the Department of the In-
terior who recognizes that if we shut 
down producers at home, we are only 
increasing the power of polluters like 
Russia and China abroad. 
Conservatives are regularly attacked 
as anti-science and anti-environment. 
This couldn’t be further from the 
truth. I can tell you there are no great-
er stewards of our land than the people 
who actually work it, be it farmers, 
ranchers, or energy producers. We care 
more about the land and natural re-
sources than just about anyone. It is 
our livelihood. 
But it is more than that. It is our 
way of life. We know that responsible 
care for the land means that we have 
to have a healthy give-and-take with 
the land. 
In Wyoming, we support both energy 
protection 
and 
conservation, 
fossil 
fuels and clean energy technologies. 
Wyoming leads the Nation as the big-
gest net energy supplier at the same 
time that we are driving the future of 
carbon capture and utilization tech-
nology. 
Representative 
HAALAND
and 
the 
Biden administration claim their ban 
on leases supports the environment, 
but this ban actually hurts environ-
mental conservation efforts. Energy 
development on public lands helps to 
fund conservation, including the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund to the 
tune of billions of dollars. 
Additionally, since 2000, the United 
States has had the largest absolute de-
cline in emissions of any country. We 
did this while at the same time rising 
to become the world’s top energy pro-
ducer. The truth of the matter is, you 
can be both environmentally friendly 
and energy friendly. In Wyoming, we 
are doing both. Under the Biden and 
Haaland administration, we will do nei-
ther. 
I want to add one more thing. I rec-
ognize the longstanding connection of 
Native Americans to the land. Rep-
resentative HAALAND has that connec-
tion, and I honor her heritage and ap-
preciate how significant the nomina-
tion of a Native American to lead the 
Department of the Interior is to the 
Tribes and to indigenous people. But 
there is no connection between her her-
itage and her support of the Green New 
Deal and attacking oil and natural gas 
production as a means to address cli-
mate change. If our goal is to reduce 
emissions, then our focus should be on 
clean air, not attacking energy produc-
tion. 
We can achieve our environmental 
goals through things like carbon cap-
ture while remaining energy inde-
pendent. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues 
to 
oppose 
Representative 
HAALAND’s nomination to serve as Sec-
retary of the Interior. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, what 
is the status of the floor? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate is considering the Haaland nomina-
tion. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of my colleague in the 
New Mexico congressional delegation, 
my Representative in the House of 
Representatives, and President Joe 
Biden’s nominee for Secretary of Inte-
rior, Congresswoman DEB HAALAND. 
Congresswoman HAALAND is a mem-
ber of the Pueblo of Laguna. She is 
what we like to call in New Mexico a 
35th-generation New Mexican. 
As many have noted, she will make 
history as the first-ever Native Amer-
ican 
Cabinet 
Secretary, 
something 
that, frankly, should have happened a 
long, long time ago in this country. 
Deb also has lived experience—as a 
single mother, as a small business 
owner, as a Tribal administrator—ex-
periences that will serve her well and 
bring real representation to President 
Joe Biden’s Cabinet. 
She grew up in a military family. Her 
father was a decorated Marine combat 
veteran, and her mother is a Navy vet-
eran. She grew up like a lot of kids 
with parents in the military, moving 
frequently, actually attending 13 dif-
ferent public schools over the course of 
her childhood. 
Before being elected to Congress, she 
owned her own business, she was the 
chair of the board of a tribally owned 
business, and also served as Tribal ad-
ministrator for the Pueblo of San 
Felipe. 
Thanks to all of that experience, 
Congresswoman HAALAND knows first-
hand how the decisions that we make 
here in Washington, and particularly in 
the Interior Department, affect com-
munities across the country, especially 
in Tribal communities and rural West-
ern States. 
As Representative of the First Dis-
trict of New Mexico, my former dis-
trict, Congresswoman HAALAND
has 
served as vice chair of the House Com-
mittee on Natural Resources and the 
chair of the Subcommittee on National 
Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, a po-
sition where she made us very proud. 
As a committee leader, she routinely 
demonstrated 
her 
commitment 
to 
working across party lines. 
Of all the Members of Congress newly 
elected in 2018, she introduced the most 
bills with bipartisan cosponsors. She 
has always shown the ability to bring 
people together, something evidenced 
by her introduction in our committee 
by Congressman DON YOUNG, Repub-
lican of Alaska. 
She has an open door. She has an 
open mind and will listen and consult 
with a diverse range of stakeholders to 
try and build real consensus. 
I am confident that she is the leader 
that we need at Interior to take on the 
important work of restoring our land-
scapes, opening up new outdoor recre-
ation opportunities for all Americans, 
and putting our public lands to work in 
confronting the climate crisis that too 
many of our colleagues have long ig-
nored. 
Americans want the Department of 
the Interior to create more equitable 
access to our public lands, to stand for 
environmental justice, to find real so-
lutions for the climate crisis, to pro-
tect wildlife and clean water, and sup-
port rural economic development. 
Many of us here in this body—in the 
Senate—demonstrated just last year, 
when we passed the historic and bipar-
tisan Great American Outdoors Act, 
that making conservation and outdoor 
recreation a key part of our national 
economic recovery is a goal that has 
the ability to unite us all, Republicans 
and Democrats. 
Implementation of that new law will 
allow us to put many Americans back 
to work repairing our campgrounds, re-
pairing our trail systems, building new 
visitor centers, and Congresswoman 
HAALAND is eager to lead that work. 
She is also uniquely qualified to help 
us restore the Department of the Inte-
rior’s 
nation-to-nation 
relationship 
with Tribal nations and to help Indian 
Country 
recover 
and 
rebuild 
from 
COVID–19. 
The Interior Department will play a 
leading role in implementing President 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan in In-
dian Country. That historic rescue 
package, which the Senate just passed 
over the weekend—and I would point 
out did not have a single Republican 
vote—includes more than $31 billion in 
emergency support for Indian Country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1487 
March 11, 2021 
Let me put that in perspective. That 
represents the single greatest invest-
ment in Indian Country in American 
history—in American history. 
This 
emergency 
support 
is 
des-
perately needed in Tribal communities. 
Over the past year, American Indians 
and Alaska Natives infected by COVID– 
19 have been hospitalized at a rate four 
times higher than White Americans 
and have died from the disease at near-
ly twice the rate. That is not just some 
statistic. I know firsthand because of 
the people I know and have lost in In-
dian Country. 
On top of these unacceptable public 
health outcomes, Tribal communities 
have also been disproportionately im-
pacted by the educational and eco-
nomic devastation of this past year— 
the lack of broadband, for example. 
These disparities reflect the per-
sistent inequities that are the direct 
result of decades of chronic under-
investment 
by 
Congress 
in 
Indian 
Country. That is why the American 
Rescue Plan includes $20 billion in 
emergency funds for Tribal govern-
ments that have taken on enormous, 
unprecedented costs to protect the 
health and safety of their members. It 
also includes billions of dollars of in-
vestment in Indian Country to expand 
access to healthcare, education, trans-
portation, housing, and even essentials 
that many of us just take for granted, 
things like broadband, like internet, 
like electricity or water. 
The Senate urgently needs to take up 
Congresswoman HAALAND’s nomination 
to lead the Department of the Interior 
so that Tribes will finally have the 
partner they need in effectively imple-
menting the American Rescue Plan and 
to help them steer their communities 
out of this perilous moment. 
Finally, it is unfortunate, frankly, 
that this needs to be said, but I do need 
to take a moment to address character-
izations of Congresswoman HAALAND 
that were raised by some of my col-
leagues in the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee that were neither 
accurate nor, frankly, appropriate to 
the kind of debate that we have in that 
committee. 
I was disappointed by the tenor of 
the debate in our committee, as some 
of my colleagues described Congress-
woman HAALAND
as ‘‘radical’’ or as 
‘‘extreme’’ for holding policy views 
that fall well within the mainstream 
and fairly represent many of her con-
stituents—I would say the vast major-
ity of her constituents. 
As 
a 
westerner, 
Congresswoman 
HAALAND well understands that con-
fronting the climate crisis, not denying 
it, and transforming our economy will 
not come without costs. We need to be 
honest about that. That is especially 
true for fossil fuel workers, including 
many of our fellow New Mexicans, who 
have long powered our economy and de-
serve our respect and support. But we 
need to be thorough on the details and 
thoughtful in preparing our traditional 
energy communities for a transition to 
the clean energy future that the mar-
ket has already told us is coming—is 
here—and we need to be honest with 
them. 
I am absolutely certain that Con-
gresswoman HAALAND will be a true 
partner to Western States like New 
Mexico, Alaska, Colorado, Montana, 
and Wyoming as we navigate this chal-
lenging transition. 
As we confront the climate crisis 
that is already an existential threat to 
our land and water resources and the 
communities that depend on those re-
sources in the West, we must diversify 
our economy. We must invest in those 
communities and remain a global lead-
er in producing and exporting energy. 
Despite the objections that have been 
raised against her nomination and the 
holds that have unfairly held up her 
confirmation, I am confident in Con-
gresswoman HAALAND’s commitment to 
work with every single one of us on 
these pressing challenges, and I am 
eager for the Senate to finally take up 
Congresswoman HAALAND’s confirma-
tion so that she can get to work pro-
tecting our natural heritage for future 
generations. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. 
BARRASSO. 
Mr. 
President, 
today the Senate is debating the nomi-
nation of DEB HAALAND, a Member of 
Congress, to serve as Secretary of the 
Interior. If confirmed, she will be the 
first Native American Cabinet member 
in U.S. history. This is a historic mo-
ment, and it should be recognized. 
I want to be very clear with you. 
Representative HAALAND’s policy views 
and lack of substantive answers during 
her nomination hearing, in my opinion, 
disqualify her for this job. 
In 
May 
of 
2019, 
Representative 
HAALAND
said unequivocally in an 
interview with The Guardian: ‘‘I am 
wholeheartedly against fracking and 
drilling on public lands.’’ On her cam-
paign website, she stated she wanted to 
‘‘keep fossil fuels in the ground.’’ On 
the same site, she pledged to ‘‘vote 
against all new fossil fuel infrastruc-
ture,’’ period. 
I, along with many western Senators, 
have consistently opposed nominees 
who hold such views, and in my opinion 
and the opinion of my constituents, 
these views are extreme. 
Representative 
HAALAND’s 
views 
aren’t just statements; they are backed 
up by legislation that she has cospon-
sored. As a Member of Congress, she 
was a day-one cosponsor of the Green 
New Deal. Now we are talking about 
destructive legislation that would not 
just overhaul American energy but 
would impact almost every sector of 
society and cause great harm to Amer-
ica’s economy. That bill was so ex-
treme that when it was brought here to 
the Senate floor, it received no sup-
port. None. 
She also cosponsored legislation to 
provide permanent Federal protections 
for the grizzly bear. I believe that leg-
islation is also extreme, and I will tell 
you why. 
The legislation that she proposed as 
a Member of the House completely dis-
regards the scientific conclusions of 
the Bush administration, the Obama 
administration, and the Trump admin-
istration. How many things can we 
name that all three of those Presidents 
agreed upon? But the three of them 
did. They all concluded—the Obama ad-
ministration, the Bush administration, 
and the Trump administration con-
cluded that it was time to take the 
grizzly bear off the endangered species 
list. 
Both Democratic and Republican In-
terior Departments determined that 
the grizzly bear was fully recovered, 
but Representative HAALAND has cho-
sen instead to ignore the science and 
the scientists of the very Department 
that she is now nominated to lead. 
Representative HAALAND’s policy views 
are squarely at odds with the mission 
of the Department of the Interior. That 
mission includes taking species off of 
an endangered species list when they 
are recovered, and the grizzly bear is 
fully recovered. 
That Department also manages our 
Nation’s oil, gas, and coal resources 
and does it in a responsible manner, 
not eliminating access to them com-
pletely. 
Just as troubling as her policy views 
were her answers to questions during 
the confirmation process. She strug-
gled or refused to answer the basic 
questions any nominee for the Depart-
ment of the Interior would be expected 
to know and answer. She was unwilling 
or unable to respond to questions about 
the Department, about resource policy, 
and about the laws that she was asked 
to implement. 
I asked her why the Biden adminis-
tration wouldn’t just let energy work-
ers keep their jobs. She had no good 
answer. 
American jobs are being sacrificed in 
the name of the Biden agenda, and Rep-
resentative HAALAND wouldn’t defend 
it—couldn’t defend it. Senator RISCH 
had to ask her multiple times if she 
supported shutting down the Keystone 
Pipeline before she admitted that she 
did. He then asked her multiple times 
why she thought that was a good idea, 
and she never really gave an answer. 
Her written answers to the questions 
for the record were equally vague and 
unacceptable. In one response to a 
question of mine, she refused to ac-
knowledge that the United States has 
higher environmental standards for oil 
and for gas production than Russia or 
Nigeria—would not acknowledge that. 
The 
American 
people 
deserve 
straight answers from a potential Sec-
retary about the law, about the rules, 
and about the regulations that are 
going to affect so many lives and liveli-
hoods. She gave very few of those at 
her nominating hearing and in her 
written responses. 
Representative HAALAND’s extreme 
views, cosponsorship of catastrophic

legislation, and lack of responsiveness 
disqualify her from this important po-
sition as Secretary of the Interior. If 
she is allowed to implement her Green 
New Deal-inspired policies at the De-
partment of the Interior, the results 
for America’s energy supply and econ-
omy will be catastrophic. 
So I cannot support and will not sup-
port her nomination, and I urge other 
Senators also to vote against the nomi-
nation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 
minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to speak today on the nomina-
tion of Representative DEBRA HAALAND 
to be the Secretary of the Interior. Her 
nomination was carefully considered 
by the Committee on Energy and Nat-
ural Resources, which I am privileged 
to chair. 
Her hearing went well, and it went 
for 2 days. Every member of the com-
mittee questioned her. Most asked her 
two rounds of questions, and some 
asked three. We then asked her 70 
pages of questions for the record—near-
ly 300 questions, many with multiple 
subparts. 
The committee questioned her close-
ly on her beliefs, her opinions, the 
President’s policies, and what she will 
do if confirmed. In the end, the com-
mittee voted to report her nomination 
favorably, 11 to 9. I am proud to have 
voted to report her nomination, and I 
am proud to speak in favor of her con-
firmation today. 
While I may not personally agree 
with 
some 
of 
Congresswoman 
HAALAND’s past statements and policy 
positions, as Secretary she will be car-
rying out President Biden’s agenda, the 
agenda that the voters elected Presi-
dent Biden to pursue. 
At her hearing, she confirmed that 
she and the administration recognize 
that our country will remain depend-
ent on fossil fuels for years to come, 
and a transition to a cleaner energy fu-
ture must come through innovation, 
not elimination. 
She also affirmed her strong commit-
ment to bipartisanship. She under-
stands the need to work across the 
aisle to find the bipartisan solutions 
needed to address the diverse needs of 
our country and has demonstrated that 
she can do so effectively. 
I was also deeply impressed by the 
strong endorsement she received by 
Congressman DON YOUNG, for whom I 
have the utmost respect. DON YOUNG 
has been in Congress long enough to be 
able to read people and know their 
heart and soul. He took the time and 
trouble to appear before the committee 
and testified to the productive working 
relationship he has had with Congress-
woman HAALAND and her willingness to 
work with him on important issues. 
That meant a lot to me, and I hope it 
will also resonate with my colleagues. 
President Biden is in perhaps the 
most difficult position a modern-day 
President has ever been in, bringing us 
back from the brink after January 6. 
That day changed me, and I feel 
strongly that with the deep divisions 
running through our country and the 
Halls of Congress today, we have to 
have people who have demonstrated 
they have the temperament and will-
ingness to reach across the aisle. Con-
gresswoman 
HAALAND
has 
dem-
onstrated she does and she will. 
As the President works to bind to-
gether a nation split by deep political, 
racial, social, and economic divisions, 
he is also trying to assemble a Cabinet 
that reflects the rich diversity of our 
Nation, one that looks like America. 
And 230 years after Washington called 
his first Cabinet meeting, it is long 
past time to give a Native American 
woman a seat at the Cabinet table. 
For these reasons, I support DEB 
HAALAND’s nomination and will vote to 
report her and to support her, and I 
look forward to working with her to 
protect our public lands and ensure the 
responsible use of our natural re-
sources in the most bipartisan manner. 
I strongly support her nomination. I 
urge all of my colleagues to vote to in-
voke cloture today and to confirm her 
nomination next week.

to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
are a year into the COVID epidemic—a 
year. If you think about it, this week a 
year ago, in Oklahoma City there was 
a basketball game going on between 
the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City 
Thunder. They were 2 minutes away 
from tip-off, and the announcer came 
on the speaker and said: Ladies and 
gentlemen, there has been a case of 
COVID–19 that has been discovered by 
one of the players. This game is post-
poned. 
And with that one announcement, a 
year ago this week, all professional 
sports stopped across the entire coun-
try, and the country, for a moment, 
woke up and realized: This is more seri-
ous than we thought. And everything 
shifted. Within a week, the United 
States had shut down for 8 weeks, and 
we went into lockdown. 
At the beginning point of that, this 
Congress came together in a bipartisan 
way and passed something called the 
CARES Act, $1.6 trillion, an enormous 
relief bill, because we were walking 
into uncharted territory. We created 
things like the Paycheck Protection

Program. We created ways to be able to 
assist behind the scenes. We even cre-
ated a way to be able to help not-for- 
profits, knowing that if the not-for- 
profit sector collapsed, there is no way 
government could possibly keep up. 
Lots of work went into that, in a bi-
partisan way, to be able to resolve 
that, and that CARES Act stabilized 
our economy—$1.6 trillion. It was one 
of five bills that we passed in this body 
last year, all bipartisan, all of them 
with us working together to try to find 
out what are the essential things we 
have to do, knowing that every single 
dollar that was spent on COVID was 
not budgeted. Every single dollar was 
borrowed, all of it from last year, a 
total of $4 trillion. 
Only $3 trillion of what was actually 
allocated last year has actually been 
spent. There is still $1 trillion allo-
cated in last year’s five bills that is 
still unallocated—$1 trillion. Over the 
weekend, 
this 
body 
passed 
on 
a 
straight partisan vote—and then the 
House did the same—to be able to add 
another $2 trillion to the spending for 
COVID–19. But this bill was different. 
There was no bipartisan conversation. 
In fact, 10 Members of the Republican 
conference went to the White House 
and tried to sit down with President 
Biden and say: Let’s do a bipartisan 
issue. There are issues that are unre-
solved. But, thankfully, we are on the 
back side of this pandemic. We are not 
at the same spot we were a year ago. 
We can now see the end. We know that 
we are going to have every adult have 
access to the vaccine by the end of 
May. The economy is turning around, 
and things are shifting dramatically, 
thankfully. So let’s do the things that 
we have to do now and keep the same 
commitment we had last year. 
Last year’s commitment was simple: 
Do the things we have to do, knowing 
every dollar was borrowed, but not 
more than we have to do because none 
of this is budgeted, and none of this has 
gone through committees. Let’s try to 
do what needs to be done and not more 
than what needs to be done—until now. 
Starting the next couple of days, the 
Treasury will begin to process bor-
rowing another $2 trillion. 
I had an Oklahoman whom I talked 
to this morning who said: How are you 
doing spending my money at this 
point? 
I laughed, and I said: Actually, this 
time, it is not even your money. It is 
not even tax dollars that are coming 
down; it is borrowed money—from the 
Chinese, from the open market, from 
everywhere that we can go get $2 tril-
lion of additional spending to be able 
to spend it. 
While many people will be eager to 
be able to receive a check for $1,400, be-
cause there are a lot of people having a 
hard time right now coming out of the 
back side of the pandemic, getting 
back to work, paying some bills—they 
may be a little surprised to be able to 
find out that they are getting a $1,400 
check, but so are prisoners. They are 
also getting a $1,400 check. They are 
also finding out that people who are 
not legally present in the country are 
getting a $1,400 check. 
There was an interesting interchange 
here on the floor on the night of that 
debate on whether people were getting 
checks or not getting checks who are 
not legally present, and so Newsweek 
magazine did a fact check on, are peo-
ple not legally present getting a $1,400 
check? Just yesterday, they published 
their fact check and came out—true, 
people not legally present in the 
United States are about to receive 
$1,400 checks in the mail based on the 
bill that was just passed on a partisan 
basis. 
There are billions of dollars in this 
bill that are allocated for vaccines. Re-
publicans were audacious enough to be 
able to raise their hands and say: What 
are those billions of dollars going to-
wards? It says vaccines, but the prob-
lem is that the Biden team has already 
announced they have done the pur-
chase for every single vaccine for every 
single adult in America. 
In other words, for every single per-
son who can actually get the vaccine, 
the vaccine purchases have already 
been done. Those are set and ready to 
go by the end of May because we still 
have $6 billion left in the vaccine fund 
from last year. But this bill that just 
passed this week, adding another $2 
trillion in debt, also includes tens of 
billions of dollars for vaccines. So the 
immediate question is, Is that for 
international vaccines? No; that is a 
different account. There is money for 
international vaccines to be sent out, 
but this is supposedly for the United 
States, for the purchase of vaccines. 
Where is that money going when we 
have already purchased ahead of time 
all of the vaccines for every single 
adult in America? We don’t know. Un-
fortunately, this bill was not taken 
through committee, so no one even had 
the conversation or time to even find 
out why. 
There is a lot of money for education 
in this bill, and there is a lot of need in 
education across the country. In fact, 
the bill that just passed, this $2 tril-
lion, actually spends almost three 
times—in this one bill, almost three 
times—for education what typically 
the U.S. Federal Government does for 
the entire year for education. I would 
say there is a great need, except when 
you actually look at the unspent 
money for education from the five bills 
that were passed last year, there is 
still $68 billion unspent from the edu-
cation funds from the five COVID bills 
last year. 
There is no requirement that the 
schools actually open or use that 
money to open the schools. In fact, 95 
percent of the money allocated for 
COVID relief for education CBO has 
said can’t even be spent this year at 
all. The earliest it could even be spent 
would be next year. And it is well in 
excess of $100 billion. 
There is a provision in this. The 
Small Business Administration, as I 
was reading through the 600-plus pages 
of this bill—that is a real picture of 
really what this bill is shaped like. One 
provision of the Small Business Admin-
istration allocates $390 million to ad-
minister the loan program, but the 
loan program itself disburses $70 mil-
lion. 
Let me run that number past us 
again. The program cost for the admin-
istrative Washington, DC, cost of run-
ning the program is $390 million; the 
actual amount that they anticipate 
that they will actually distribute is $70 
million, totaling a $460 million pro-
gram total. Just $70 million of it actu-
ally gets to people; $390 million of it 
stays in Washington, DC, for the bu-
reaucracy. 
All of those things could have been 
fixed if we actually went through com-
mittee. 
In this COVID bill, there are things 
like new customs duties for South 
Korea. I have yet to figure out what 
South Korea and customs duties have 
to do with COVID. 
There is also slipped in, for the first 
time ever, Federal funding for abor-
tion. I have yet to see what abortion 
has to do with COVID, but this bill, for 
the first time in 44 years, uses Federal 
tax dollars to start paying for abor-
tion. That has not been done before. In 
fact, when Joe Biden used to sit in that 
chair right over there, he often spoke 
about that we should not use Federal 
funds for abortion funding. Yet, in the 
COVID bill, somehow abortion funding 
has become relevant to fighting off 
COVID. 
I have had some people ask questions 
about whether this bill could have been 
better if we had actually done it in a 
bipartisan way. It could have been sig-
nificantly better. If you ask how I 
know that, it is because I saw the five 
bills we did last year, and they didn’t 
have problems like this in them last 
year because we worked it out to-
gether. This one is different. 
This bill could have been signifi-
cantly improved in a major way. One of 
them is the way we deal with charities. 
You see, in previous bills, we sat down 
and talked about our not-for-profits. 
I have a very strong belief personally 
that we have three safety nets in 
America. Families are the first safety 
net; nonprofits, churches, faith-based 
houses of worship are the second in so-
ciety; and the third safety net is gov-
ernment. 
Government can never keep up with 
all of the needs in America. If families 
collapse and if our not-for-profits col-
lapse, government will never be able to 
keep up. So in previous versions, we 
have actually addressed that with not- 
for-profits. We did that in the Pay-
check Protection Program to make 
sure that not-for-profits could get as-
sistance and get help to be able to sur-
vive through this. 
We also added in a way that we would 
encourage individuals to be able to do-
nate to not-for-profits. We gave them a 
write-off. In the very first bill, we

added in $300. If you gave to a not-for- 
profit, you get to write that off your 
taxes right away. In the December bill, 
we reupped that—$300 for an individual 
and $600 for a family that you could 
write off on your taxes immediately if 
you would donate to a not-for-profit. 
Why did we do that? Well, I brought 
that issue up, quite frankly, and we 
had wide bipartisan agreement to say 
that was a good idea because we should 
encourage not-for-profits because we 
need them for that safety net. Not-for- 
profits are the faces that take care of 
the hungry and the homeless and the 
hurting in our society, and we need 
them to be strong. But in this bill that 
came out, we didn’t address the not- 
for-profits. We didn’t have the option 
to be able to bring it up and debate it 
and say: What should we do? So it just 
got left out. 
Why should we continue to be able to 
push on this issue? Because we need 
them to be strong. They are a remark-
able part of our economy, our safety 
net, and our community. They are 
Americans doing what we do best— 
serving each other, serving our neigh-
bors, and helping in every possible way 
that we can. 
So a group of us have gathered to-
gether to be able to drop a bill dealing 
with these not-for-profits and encour-
aging us, again, to accelerate this issue 
of giving Americans the ability to be 
able to write off on their taxes, wheth-
er they itemize or not, a below-the-line 
deduction for their taxes to be able to 
make sure that we encourage people to 
be able to give to not-for-profits. And 
it matters. If you want to be able to 
help do something significant, help 
those close to you and the ongoing 
work that they are doing. 
Those folks have felt it a lot. Accord-
ing to a study by Johns Hopkins Center 
for Civil Society Studies, between 
March and May of 2020, our nonprofits 
have projected job losses around 1.6 
million workers. They leaned in and 
helped anyway, even though they were 
in real trouble. As of December 2020, 
the nonprofit workforce still remained 
down by about 930,000 jobs. 
We have a long way to go to have 
that sector actually fully recover. 
They are such a significant part of our 
economy. 
According 
to 
the 
latest 
data—again, available from Johns Hop-
kins—it was found that nonprofit orga-
nizations employed the third largest 
workforce in the U.S. economy; non-
profits, a group that people just drive 
past all the time, but many people 
drive to or walk to because they need 
real help. 
What happened when we actually 
passed the CARES Act and we added 
this 
deduction 
in 
and 
encouraged 
Americans to start donating to not-for- 
profits to help them survive this year? 
What happened with that? Well, I can 
tell you what happened because now we 
can look back and see the data. The 
most recent data we have for the fund-
raising effect for this project shows 
that there was an increase in the third 
quarter of 2020 of charitable giving—a 
6-percent increase in donors and an 11- 
percent increase in new donors when 
compared to 2019. 
We put that incentive out, and people 
saw the need across the country and 
the opportunity to do that, and people 
gave. We saw increases in all donor cat-
egories in the third quarter of last 
year, the largest increase in giving 
coming from donors giving $250 or less. 
That increased by 17 percent just in the 
third quarter of last year. 
I understand there are a lot of factors 
to that. There were a lot of needs, and 
people were doing what they do best 
and engaging. But we need to continue 
to encourage the strength of our not- 
for-profits because if there is a focus to 
say 
‘‘Well, 
government 
should 
do 
that,’’ government can send checks, 
but government has a hard time actu-
ally meeting human needs. That re-
quires a face and a person and a com-
mitment, and that is done differently 
when it is a not-for-profit. 
We have great Federal workers all 
across the country who work really 
hard, but they also work often from a 
distance. Local not-for-profits in small, 
rural communities will have a much 
greater connection to individuals to be 
able to help in their time of crisis than 
someone 1,000 miles away who means 
well but doesn’t see them on a daily 
basis. If we want to help human needs, 
we will find ways to be able to help 
not-for-profits. 
Tuesday of this week, Senator COONS, 
Senator LEE, Senator SHAHEEN, Sen-
ator SCOTT from South Carolina, Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, Senator COLLINS, Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO, and myself—we all 
introduced the Universal Giving Pan-
demic Response and Recovery Act. We 
are just asking a simple question: Can 
we continue to strengthen our not-for- 
profits and encourage Americans to 
give to those not-for-profits with their 
time, with their money, and with their 
passion and joy? When you actually en-
gage with a not-for-profit, you will find 
you are the one who really receives. 
There is not a moment that I talk to 
somebody who serves in a not-for-profit 
that they don’t tell me how hard the 
work is and how draining the work is, 
and then with a smile, they will say 
how rewarding it really is. There is not 
a time that I walk into a homeless 
shelter or a food bank and they don’t 
tell me about the people they meet on 
a daily basis and the joy for them 
going home, talking to their own fam-
ily, and remembering the blessings 
that they have, and the joy they have 
to get up the next day to be able to 
help those in greatest need. Let’s en-
courage that. 
If you want to have a Biblical exam-
ple, Biblically, the calling for govern-
ment is to encourage those who do 
good and punish those who do wrong. 
We have a lot of nonprofits around the 
country that are doing good. Let’s en-
courage them, and let’s encourage 
Americans to be able to be engaged in 
volunteering and in giving. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk about 
the unfolding, urgent situation on our 
southern border, and I do so as the 
ranking Republican on the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee. 
This unfortunate situation at the 
border includes a lot of kids coming 
over the border, UACs, as they call 
them, unaccompanied alien children. 
These children are making a long and 
dangerous 
journey 
north, 
putting 
themselves at risk and bringing our 
immigration system and our shelter 
system along the border to a breaking 
point. 
You may have heard that the Biden 
administration insists this is not a cri-
sis. Here are the facts. You decide. 
This chart shows the dire situation 
that we are in. On Tuesday, the most 
recent confirmed information we have 
is there were 3,400 of these children in 
Border Patrol custody. Ten days ago, 
that number was 1,700. So in 10 days, 
this number has doubled. To put this in 
perspective, at the very height of the 
border crisis in 2019 that we all remem-
ber being talked about a lot on the 
floor of this Senate and around the 
country, families and children were 
coming in, in big numbers. At the very 
height, it was 2,600 unaccompanied 
kids. Today, based on some informa-
tion we just received anecdotally from 
the Customs and Border Protection 
folks, it is over 3,500. It is a 35-percent 
increase even from where it was during 
the crisis, and it is growing. 
Under law, these children have to be 
transferred to the Federal Department 
of Health and Human Services, HHS, 
within 72 hours of their being appre-
hended, and why we had that law in 
place was to be able to help these kids. 
So instead of being in a Border Patrol 
detention facility, which, by the way, 
were all designed for single males— 
they don’t have any separation, don’t 
have any trained people to help provide 
care to children, and it is law enforce-
ment, Border Patrol agents—but with-
in 72 hours, we had said that you have 
to transfer these children to a Health 
and Human Services facility that is ap-
propriate for children. How is that 
working? 
Again, as of Tuesday, there were 3,400 
of these kids in Border Patrol custody 
in the wrong kind of detention facili-
ties for children. There were 2,800 chil-
dren who were ready to transfer to 
HHS. In other words, they had been 
screened, gone through a process. As of 
Tuesday, there were 500 beds available, 
meaning 2,300 children are remaining 
in Border Patrol custody in over-
crowded, adult facilities without prop-
er care because there is nowhere to 
take them. 
Look, it is a bad situation. HHS con-
tractors are supposed to be trained to 
care for the kids. The Border Patrol

agents are not trained for that. They 
are doing their best, but it is not a safe 
situation for the kids. By the way, no-
body in Border Patrol believes it is a 
good situation for the kids. These fa-
cilities, the Border Patrol facilities at 
the Border Patrol stations and HHS fa-
cilities are all at a breaking point. 
They are busting at the seams. Is that 
a crisis? I don’t know. You decide. 
This influx comes, by the way, during 
a season when you normally don’t have 
a lot of people coming over the border. 
This is in the winter. Normally, in the 
spring and then in the fall, you see the 
biggest influxes of families, kids, indi-
viduals. So we expect these numbers to 
get a lot worse. We expect it to get a 
lot worse into the spring. 
By the way, we spoke to Customs and 
Border Patrol folks today. They told us 
the numbers are up again today. In 
fact, we have some internal document 
from the Department of Homeland Se-
curity that a media organization re-
ported on. It is an official document 
that says DHS, themselves, predict 
there will be 117,000 children who will 
be placed in this situation this year. So 
they know it just is growing. 
Again, is it a crisis? You decide. It is 
certainly a dangerous situation. By all 
accounts, many of these migrants, in-
cluding children, face serious threats 
to their lives and well-being on the trip 
north. 
Just as happened in the past surges 
in 2014 and 2019, we know this includes 
many victims of human trafficking 
who are deceived and coerced by traf-
fickers and smugglers as they are 
taken from Central America up to the 
U.S. border. The trip is treacherous. 
We have evidence that exploitation and 
sexual abuse occurs along the way. 
In 2019, again, the last time this hap-
pened, estimates of migrants who were 
victims of sexual or physical abuse 
along the journey ranged from 30 to 75 
percent. Individual victims have de-
scribed incredibly disturbing accounts 
of being subjected to violence, sexual 
assault, rape by traffickers and other 
criminals. It is a bad situation. 
By the way, this situation is the di-
rect result of policy changes. The new 
administration came in determined to 
dismantle all of what the previous ad-
ministration 
had 
done 
to 
try 
to 
disincentivize people from coming to 
the border, and they have been effec-
tive in doing that. They have disman-
tled the immigration practices and 
proceedings that were working to re-
duce these incentives. It had resulted 
in very few kids coming to the border, 
as an example—almost none. 
Last week, the Secretary of Home-
land Security said in a press conference 
that the surge of unaccompanied kids 
is a ‘‘challenge’’ but not a ‘‘crisis.’’ He 
then deflected blame to the previous 
administration. That is fine. Look, I 
wish it were just a challenge that 
didn’t require an urgent response, but 
that is not the reality along the border 
today. I, frankly, don’t care what we 
call it. Call it a difficult situation, a 
challenge, whatever you want, but I 
care a lot about what we do in re-
sponse. 
There is an old saying that says 
Washington only responds to a crisis. I 
think, unfortunately, there is a lot of 
truth to that. We have to respond here. 
We have to do something. That is why 
I think we need to consider this dire 
situation a crisis before it gets much 
worse. 
The next chart shows the reality, 
which is this surge happened almost 
immediately after President Biden and 
his administration were sworn in and 
they made these announcements about 
changes in policy. Here we have the 
election. Here we have the swearing-in. 
Look at this huge surge in both family 
units and in these kids. As I said, we 
have twice as many kids today as we 
had 10 days ago. 
This is surging up. Nearly 10,000 un-
accompanied alien children and twice 
as many family members crossed our 
border in February, and that is the 
shortest month of the year. These 
surges stopped under the previous ad-
ministration because they put in place 
policies that reduce the incentives for 
individuals, families, and unaccom-
panied minors to try to unlawfully 
enter the United States. In less than 2 
months, the Biden administration has 
systemically taken away these tools 
that were being used to reduce these 
incentives. On day one, the new admin-
istration revoked the emergency dec-
laration for the border, stopped con-
struction of the border fence, and 
placed a 100-day halt to deportations. 
Not surprisingly, this gave traffickers 
the green light to exploit the situation, 
and more people and more drugs are 
now moving across the border. 
Next, the new administration re-
versed what is known as the Migrant 
Protection Protocols or the ‘‘Remain 
in Mexico’’ policy, which required asy-
lum seekers to wait in Mexico rather 
than being released in communities 
around the United States while waiting 
for their asylum claims to be adju-
dicated. About 20 percent of the asylum 
seekers who went through the entire 
application process, including all of the 
hearings, were granted asylum in 2018. 
So, if you go through all of the proc-
ess, about 20 percent of those individ-
uals actually got asylum. Now, that is 
a self-selected group because I know 
not everybody goes to the hearing. In 
fact, the best data show that most 
don’t show up for all of the hearings. 
The long-term data show that about 
half of all asylum applicants eventu-
ally get removal orders due to their 
not attending all of their asylum hear-
ings. We don’t have great data on this, 
to be honest, and some people say that 
very few go to these asylum hearings. 
Some say more do. The point is that 
about half of them are getting removal 
orders—we know that—for not attend-
ing all of their asylum hearings. 
Given that there is a 1.2 million-case 
backlog in America today for asylum 
applicants and that there were fewer 
than 5,000 noncriminals deported last 
year by ICE, that tells us that, under 
the current system, if you are a non-
criminal asylum seeker who is denied 
asylum and is subject to one of these 
removal orders, it is highly unlikely 
that you are going to actually end up 
being deported from the United States. 
Asylum seekers know that. So do the 
traffickers. It is no wonder there has 
been a surge of those who want to live 
in the United States who have come to 
the border and sought asylum in recent 
years. 
I went to the border in 2019, and 
many of my colleagues have been down 
to the border to see this situation. I 
will be going back again soon to see 
firsthand what is happening and to see 
how we can help. It should not be a 
partisan issue. It should be one in 
which 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
alike see what is happening—see the 
tragedy unfolding along the border— 
and do something to address it. This 
Migrant Protection Program put in 
place by the Trump administration had 
resulted in a sharp reduction in the 
surge of asylum claims as people real-
ized, pending their asylum hearings, 
they were not going to be released in 
U.S. communities. Now we are seeing 
the reverse happen. 
Second, the Biden administration ac-
tually suspended Safe Third Country 
agreements with the Governments of 
El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, 
which allowed migrants to apply for 
asylum in the first foreign country 
they crossed into. This, of course, re-
duced incentives for migrants from 
those countries to make the long, ardu-
ous, and dangerous journey to the 
southern border. 
These agreements were in the process 
of being fully implemented, but they 
were already helping and had the po-
tential of finding a much more expedi-
tious way to identify and process those 
who would qualify for legitimate asy-
lum-refugee status before they would 
come all the way to our border. All 
that work that has been accomplished 
has now been lost. I urge the adminis-
tration to reinstate those Safe Third 
Country agreements with Guatemala, 
Honduras, and El Salvador. 
Third, the new administration has 
also significantly changed the way we 
process migrants during the COVID–19 
crisis. Instead of establishing the prac-
tice of turning away most immigrant 
and nonimmigrant visa holders to pro-
tect the health and safety of the Amer-
ican people, we are now learning from 
media reports, including the Wash-
ington Post, that this new administra-
tion has made an unofficial exception 
to the COVID–19 rules for children and 
for families. 
Border Patrol agents and CBP offi-
cers who are on the frontlines are tell-
ing us that they are returning to the 
pre-COVID practice of bringing people 
into the country despite the health cri-
sis that all of us understand. The re-
ports are that either the CBP officers 
are not testing kids and families for

COVID at all or, if they are, they are 
still releasing some of those who test 
positive to shelters or into the United 
States with a request that they quar-
antine after they travel to their final 
destinations in the interior of the 
United States. In fact, we know of one 
instance in which more than 100 unlaw-
ful immigrants in Brownsville, TX, 
who tested positive for COVID–19, were 
simply told to quarantine when they 
reached their final destinations regard-
less 
of 
how 
many 
people 
they 
interacted with when taking a bus—in 
that case, most were taking a bus, ap-
parently—or when taking a plane to 
their 
destinations. 
Obviously, 
that 
doesn’t make any sense. 
The final policy changes that encour-
age illegal entry is the new administra-
tion’s advocating for amnesty for those 
here illegally without making it clear 
that such amnesty would not apply to 
anyone not already here. That is im-
portant. As the experience of the last 
amnesty in 1986 demonstrated, unless 
it is very clear that illegal entry won’t 
be rewarded, it will spawn more illegal 
entries. Now, let’s face it. The traf-
fickers and the smugglers are going to 
take advantage of this, and they are 
going to misrepresent the reality, but, 
still, it is important that all of us as 
policymakers make it very clear, as we 
talk about amnesty, that it is not as to 
the people who might come in the fu-
ture; it is as to the people who are al-
ready here. 
I will say that the State Department 
has announced that it will be rein-
stating the Central American Minors 
Program, which was a streamlined ref-
ugee process that existed under the 
Obama administration and was run by 
the U.S. Government and the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, but it was 
discontinued under the Trump adminis-
tration. I think it is a positive thing 
that they are reinstating that. 
We don’t have all of the details yet, 
but I will tell you that standing up this 
program without incentivizing people 
to use it is not going to be very effec-
tive. Even if it were to be as effective 
as it was at the height of the program, 
which was during the Obama adminis-
tration, it would not be nearly enough 
people. In 2 years, the program reset-
tled 3,300 individuals. So 3,300 children 
were resettled in 2 years. That is not 
going to make a real impact when we 
are receiving, right now, 3,300 children 
every couple of weeks at the border. 
Again, I hope they do reinstate that 
program, as I think that would be posi-
tive, but they have to do much more in 
order to avoid this tragic situation 
from continuing and getting much 
worse. 
The decision by the new administra-
tion to change all of these policies, 
which were working, without having 
viable alternatives is causing this 
chaos. It was done without thinking 
through the real safety and security 
concerns for both communities and 
citizens of the United States as well as 
for these unaccompanied kids and their 
families. As a result, we have a surge of 
people being incentivized to enter our 
country unlawfully, and our systems 
are being strained during a public 
health emergency. 
This influx is even worse than in 2019, 
not just because the numbers are 
greater but because we now have the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and children and 
families are being forced into tight 
quarters in detention facilities. Asy-
lum seekers with COVID–19 are being 
released into our communities, and 
Customs and Border Protection officers 
who haven’t been able to receive the 
vaccine yet, which is a problem, are 
being exposed to this influx of mi-
grants who haven’t been tested. So it is 
an even bigger problem—forgetting the 
numbers—given the situation we are 
in. 
That ties in another concern I have 
about the way this crisis has been han-
dled so far, which is the administra-
tion’s response to the overcrowding at 
the shelter facilities. It has been to 
rush and potentially cut corners to 
place these unaccompanied children 
with sponsors because their goal, after 
HHS detention in HHS facilities, is to 
get these children out to sponsor fami-
lies. The standards of due diligence 
that are required to ensure these chil-
dren are not being placed in danger are 
not being met, as far as we can tell, 
which continues a troubling trend that 
goes back years and administrations. 
It is an issue I have worked on since 
2015, when we had a terrible situation 
in my home State of Ohio wherein kids 
were given back to the traffickers by 
HHS—the traffickers who had brought 
them up from Central America by lying 
to their parents about what they were 
going to do: take them to school and so 
on. These kids ended up working on an 
egg farm, 6 to 7 days a week, below the 
minimum wage. I have seen this. I have 
seen what happens when HHS does not 
take its time and do it right, and it is 
very difficult for HHS to do that with 
the surge that it has. 
Over the course of three bipartisan 
reports and hearings as part of the Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions, which I chair, and across two dif-
ferent administrations, we found fail-
ures to ensure the safety of or to even 
keep track of these vulnerable children 
once they were handed off to sponsors 
as well as a fundamental refusal by 
Agencies to accept that they were re-
sponsible for the welfare of these kids. 
That is the reality. Our bipartisan in-
vestigations also found that the Office 
of Refugee Resettlement failed to exer-
cise appropriate oversight at its facili-
ties and wasted millions of taxpayer 
dollars on organizations and on con-
tractors that could not acquire State 
licenses to safely open the planned 
shelter facilities. 
As those in this administration at-
tempt to process this influx of unac-
companied kids and safely get them to 
longer term housing solutions, it is ur-
gent that they do the due diligence on 
who is going to be looking after these 
children and not cut corners as some 
reports are indicating. That means 
fingerprinting 
the 
sponsors. 
That 
means background checks. That means 
home visits. The Federal Government 
cannot allow these kids to fall victim 
to human trafficking, to abuse, or 
other harm. 
I, along with my bipartisan cospon-
sors, will be reintroducing the Respon-
sibility for Unaccompanied Minors Act 
again in the coming days to help en-
sure these requirements are met to 
protect our kids. 
Here is the reality: Once these chil-
dren arrive at the border, there are no 
good options. The answer is to stop 
providing the incentives, the pull fac-
tor. That is the short-term imperative. 
We should not be encouraging these 
young people to make that arduous 
journey to then have them end up in a 
detention facility. That is wrong for 
them. It is a place where single males 
are crowded together but where kids 
are not taken care of. Then, when they 
have to go to the HHS facility, there is 
not enough room—again, making the 
point of there being 3,400 kids in deten-
tion and 2,800 kids who are ready to be 
transferred to HHS, to more appro-
priate facilities, but there are only 500 
beds. So 2,300 are kept in these over-
crowded facilities that are meant for 
single males. It is not a good option. 
There is no good option. The option is 
to keep them from coming up to the 
border in the first place. 
Yes, we can do more on the push fac-
tors also. That means investing in Cen-
tral America and other places to try to 
make those countries places where peo-
ple would want to stay rather than 
come to the United States. Yet, my 
colleagues, that is what is called a 
long-term solution. Let’s be frank. I 
am for it, but we have to recognize 
that this is not a solution to the cur-
rent crisis that we face. 
In the last 5 years, we have spent $3.6 
billion of U.S. taxpayer funds in aid for 
these Northern Triangle countries of 
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. 
President Biden is proposing to spend 
another $4 billion in those countries. I 
support smart investments that don’t 
get wasted because of corruption or 
other challenges, but it won’t fix the 
crisis this month, this year, or next 
year. The development of the Northern 
Triangle is a decades-long effort—one 
we need to do but one that is not going 
to address, again, the crisis that we 
face now. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
also step up efforts to tie any aid to 
better collaboration with our inter-
national partners, including with the 
Governments of Mexico, Guatemala, 
Honduras, and El Salvador, to address 
this challenge, discourage migration, 
and provide alternatives to those seek-
ing to make the dangerous journey 
north. They need to help us, and they 
have in the past. 
In the Trump administration, we had 
a valuable partner in Mexico, as an ex-
ample. It used tens of thousands of its

own military to patrol its own south-
ern border to ensure migrants could be 
processed, if necessary, and turned 
away if they didn’t meet the require-
ments. That was very helpful. I am 
concerned that these troops have now 
been pulled back—that is the informa-
tion that we are receiving—partly be-
cause, as we are told, President Biden 
is not encouraging the current Mexican 
leadership to continue this practice. I 
hope that changes. The current surge 
in unaccompanied children at our bor-
der, in the midst of a global pandemic, 
is a situation in which no one wins and 
the children lose the most. 
I am disappointed that the Biden ad-
ministration chose to overturn the 
policies put in place by the Trump ad-
ministration, which were to help con-
trol the flow of migrants during this 
pandemic, without having any viable 
alternatives. I am concerned that lead-
ers at key Agencies involved in the re-
sponse to this crisis are somehow see-
ing it as in their interests to downplay 
the severity of the situation. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
change course. Put back in place smart 
policies that reduce the pull factors, 
and address the need for legal and or-
derly processes for migration. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before 
he leaves the floor, let me just con-
gratulate our colleague from Ohio. 
That was, perhaps, the most concise 
and informative speech I have heard on 
that topic, including speeches that I 
have given on that topic. In rep-
resenting a border State, as I do, and in 
my having served on the Judiciary 
Committee and on the Immigration 
Subcommittee for my entire time here, 
the way he described it, I thought, was 
entirely accurate. I think you can call 
it a crisis, a challenge—whatever you 
want to call it—but it is getting worse 
all the time, and I think it will get 
much, much worse if we don’t act and 
act together. So I thank him for his 
outstanding remarks. 
(Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the 
Chair.) 
REMEMBERING HOWARD BALDWIN 
Madam President, I have had the 
privilege of working alongside some 
truly 
incredible 
public 
servants 
throughout 
my 
career. 
Without 
a 
doubt, one of the finest was Howard 
Baldwin. 
Howard was brilliant, effective, hu-
morous, and exceedingly humble—a 
rare combination made even more 
striking because of his kindness. He 
was an extraordinary person. 
Over the weekend, I received the sad 
news that Howard had passed away, 
and I want to share just a few words 
about the incredible life and legacy of 
my late friend. 
Howard and I crossed paths as young 
lawyers in San Antonio, TX, where we 
used to play a little pickup basketball 
together. 
He graduated from St. Mary’s School 
of Law a few years before I did, and 
much to the benefit of families across 
our State, he quickly found his calling 
working on child support and family 
issues. 
Howard spent time as a private law-
yer, as a State-appointed judge, and as 
a regional director for child support en-
forcement. He bounced back and forth 
between the Texas Attorney General’s 
Office and the Texas Department of 
Protective and Regulatory Services, 
and his colleagues would joke: Howard, 
how can we miss you if you won’t stay 
gone? 
But a man as talented and devoted 
and as effective as Howard is always in 
high demand. And when I was elected 
as attorney general of Texas in 1998, he 
was one of the first people I called. 
At the time, the child support divi-
sion of the attorney general’s office 
was a disaster. Staff were completely 
overwhelmed by the sky-high number 
of cases. The office ran a computer sys-
tem that was so dysfunctional it actu-
ally managed to decrease productivity, 
and a lack of support from previous 
leadership made even minor improve-
ments impossible. 
I 
knew 
turning 
things 
around 
wouldn’t be easy, but it was absolutely 
essential that we do so, and I knew 
that Howard was the only man that I 
knew for that job. 
A news article at the time summed 
up the monumental task of fixing the 
broken child support enforcement sys-
tem by saying, ‘‘Howard Baldwin will 
look either like a fool or a hero; there 
won’t be much middle ground.’’ 
Today, with the benefit of hindsight, 
I can assure you that Howard came out 
looking like a hero. 
Unlike previous leaders of the child 
support division, Howard didn’t view it 
as purely an enforcement or collection 
agency. He truly cared about the chil-
dren and family welfare, and he wanted 
to help families get to a place where 
both parents could be involved in their 
children’s lives. 
To better serve these families, he 
shifted our focus to customer service. 
He hired more staff. He brought the di-
vision into the technology age, and he 
empowered the incredible attorneys 
and staff we worked with to implement 
changes at every level to affect not 
only the quality of service but also the 
quality of outcomes. And the results 
speak for themselves. 
During my time as attorney general, 
the child support division collected 
more than $3 billion in child support 
for more than 1 million Texas children. 
We broke records annually for the most 
child support ever collected in a year 
and the biggest year-to-year increases 
in collection. 
The Texas Child Support Division at 
the Attorney General’s Office went 
from an unproductive mess to the pre-
mier organization of its type in the 
country. We became a model for other 
States, and Howard was the guy with 
all the answers. 
I had so much trust in Howard and 
his ability to steer the ship that I later 
asked him to serve as my first assist-
ant attorney general. This is the per-
son who oversees the day-to-day oper-
ations of the AG’s office which, at the 
time, employed more than 3,800 Tex-
ans. 
Howard used his deep-seated knowl-
edge of Texas State government to im-
prove the attorney general’s office 
across the board. He built strong rela-
tionships with folks on both sides of 
the aisle, and when something needed 
to be done, all he had to do was to pick 
up the phone and call a friend and a 
colleague. He knew who to call, what 
to ask for, and how to convince the big-
gest skeptic in the room to see things 
his way without ever breaking the 
smile on his face. 
I say this in all candor with the 
greatest admiration: Howard was the 
most effective bureaucrat I have ever 
met. 
As big an impact as Howard had on 
my State—our State—his influence has 
reached beyond the borders of the Lone 
Star State. 
Howard was an active member of the 
National Child Support Enforcement 
Association, where he spent more than 
a decade as a board member and nearly 
2 years as president. He earned the re-
spect and admiration of folks across 
the country who shared his passion for 
helping children and helping families. 
When a friend and former colleague 
of Howard’s shared the news of his 
passing with his national network, the 
response was immediate and over-
whelming. Friends and colleagues from 
Washington State, Kentucky, and New 
York said that Howard, the Texas bu-
reaucrat, was their mentor. 
For those who had the privilege of 
knowing Howard, this wasn’t a sur-
prise. After all, Howard had a wonder-
ful way of advancing the careers of oth-
ers around him. He wanted them to 
succeed as well. When their joint ef-
forts were successful, he then made 
sure that they, not he, got the credit. 
He was generous with his time and 
his knowledge, whether helping some-
one with an entry-level job or a divi-
sion leader in another State. 
Howard was consistently driven by 
his passion for helping children. More 
than two decades ago, he said: ‘‘It gets 
into your blood because it makes such 
a difference in people’s lives.’’ 
And I can tell you that I have seen 
the difference firsthand time and time 
and time again. During my first term 
in the Senate, I was traveling to El 
Paso, TX, and I was about to get on my 
flight when a guy named Joe—I could 
see it on his uniform—who was part of 
the ground crew there, came up to me 
and said: Are you JOHN CORNYN? 
I said: Yes, I am. 
And he asked: I bet you don’t remem-
ber me. Do you? 
Well, as you can imagine, it caught 
me a little off guard, so I smiled and 
said: I am sorry. Can you remind me? 
He said: I am Joe. You sued me and 
threatened to put me in jail for not 
paying my child support.

S1494 
March 11, 2021 
Well, that is not the response I ex-
pected, but he said: You took me to 
court because I wasn’t paying my child 
support, but I didn’t want to pay it be-
cause my ex-wife wouldn’t allow me to 
see my children. 
He was holding up the chocks that go 
under the wheels of the airplane to 
keep it from rolling, and at this point 
I was thinking: This guy is going to 
take a swing at me, or worse. 
He then surprised me again. He said: 
But you know what? After I started 
paying it after you sued me, the judge 
ordered my ex-wife to let me spend 
time with our daughter, and I realized 
what kind of father I needed to be, 
what kind of man I needed to be, and I 
made things right. 
He raised his left hand and pointed at 
his wedding ring. He said: My wife and 
I got back together. 
Well, I was in awe, not only of Joe, 
but the power of people like Howard 
Baldwin and everyone at the child sup-
port division trying to protect children 
and trying to restore families. I don’t 
think any one of us could have ex-
pected to help reunite a divorced cou-
ple, but Howard did everything in his 
power to help parents support their 
children, both financially and emotion-
ally, to encourage positive outcomes. 
There is no way to quantify the 
amount of good Howard did throughout 
his career and throughout his life, but 
I can say without a doubt he changed 
lives—many, many lives. 
Howard’s advocacy for children was 
his calling, but there were no children 
he loved more than his two boys, 
James and Eric. Howard’s family was 
his entire world. His wife Rita was at 
its center. Throughout their 46-year 
marriage, Rita wholeheartedly sup-
ported and encouraged Howard. I know 
she was proud of him. 
So on behalf of the State of Texas, I 
want to thank the Baldwin family for 
sharing their beloved patriarch with us 
for so many decades. I personally am 
grateful, profoundly grateful, for How-
ard’s friendship and his impact on my 
life and the great example of service 
that he set. 
Sandy and I send our deepest condo-
lences to Rita, James, Eric, and the 
long list of friends across Texas and 
the country who are mourning the loss 
of this incredible public servant and 
friend. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
NOMINATION OF DEBRA ANNE HAALAND 
Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I rise 
today to speak in support of the his-
toric nomination of Congresswoman 
DEB HAALAND to serve as our Nation’s 
next Secretary of the Interior. 
This Cabinet position is of great im-
portance to our Nation and especially 
to Western States like mine—like ours, 
Madam President, and I can’t think of 
anyone more qualified to fill this posi-
tion 
than 
Congresswoman 
DEB 
HAALAND, one of the first Native Amer-
ican Members of Congress and a proven 
leader. 
Let me start by telling you why this 
Cabinet position means so much to Ne-
vada. In the Silver State, over 50 mil-
lion acres of land is managed by the In-
terior Department. That is over 70 per-
cent of our entire State. 
People come to Nevada from all over 
the world to experience our pristine 
and our majestic public lands and 
monuments. These lands, well, they are 
not just a source of beauty; they are 
also a source of economic opportunity 
for Nevada. 
In previous administrations, we have 
seen efforts to put those public lands 
on the chopping blocks. But that won’t 
happen under DEB HAALAND’s leader-
ship. 
I have had the chance to speak with 
Congresswoman HAALAND
one-on-one, 
hear directly from her, and get to know 
her. 
She has spent her entire career fight-
ing to protect public lands, waters, 
monuments, cultural sites and natural 
beauties around our Nation and, of 
course, in our great State of Nevada. 
And I know, if confirmed, she will 
work with me and Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO to strike the right balance be-
tween critical protections for our pub-
lic lands, environment, and wildlife, 
and the needed economic development 
across Nevada. 
DEB
HAALAND, well, she has been 
committed to conservation as a Mem-
ber of Congress, and she will be just as 
committed to conservation as our next 
Interior Secretary. 
Congresswoman HAALAND, she will 
take the bold steps needed to confront 
climate change. And if this historic 
confirmation succeeds, she will bring 
new and needed perspective to the 
Presidential 
Cabinet—one 
that 
has 
been missing since the President’s Cab-
inet was formed all the way back in 
1789. 
As Secretary of the Interior, DEB 
HAALAND will be the first—the first— 
Native American Cabinet member, and 
she will give a voice to Tribal commu-
nities in Nevada and across our coun-
try. 
She will take steps to restore and re-
spect Tribal sovereignty. She will con-
tinue to be an advocate and an ally to 
Native communities, and she will help 
to right the many historic wrongs and 
injustices that have been committed 
against Native Americans and Tribal 
communities. 
DEB HAALAND is exceptionally quali-
fied to lead this Agency. She brings a 
breadth of experience and diversity to 
the table. She will be a positive force 
for good. She will guide our Nation for-
ward. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
DEB HAALAND’s nomination. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING REX LEE 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I come 
to the Senate floor today in recogni-
tion of an anniversary of sorts. My late 
father, Rex Lee, died 25 years ago 
today after an extended and heroic bat-
tle with cancer. 
I prefer to remember my dad not as 
someone who was ill but someone who 
was full of life and healthy for most of 
his life—in fact, his entire life, even 
while battling with a significant ill-
ness. 
Rex grew up in the small town of St. 
Johns, AZ. It is a really, really small 
town. In fact, we used to joke that he 
may have been 21 years old before he 
realized that the true name of the town 
wasn’t ‘‘Resume Speed.’’ It was a little 
dot along the highway in eastern Ari-
zona. It was a place that he loved, and 
it was a place where he learned to love 
those dear to him and close to him, a 
place where he was taught in school 
and in church, where he learned to 
serve his fellow beings. 
He attended Brigham Young Univer-
sity as a freshman in the fall of 1953, 
somewhat under protest. He had want-
ed to attend the University of Arizona, 
like his cousins Mo and Stewart Udall 
before him. 
His parents told him: You can go 
wherever you want, but your first year 
needs to be spent at Brigham Young 
University in Provo, UT. 
He went there and was immediately 
smitten with the place and commenced 
a relationship that would extend for 
the rest of his life and would signifi-
cantly impact his life in many, many 
ways. 
Halfway through college, he left to 
serve a 21⁄2-year mission for The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 
Mexico. During that time, to say he be-
came fluent in the Spanish language 
and the Mexican culture would be an 
understatement. It was a fluency that 
never really left him. 
While I was a missionary many dec-
ades later, he used to write me letters 
in Spanish, and even after I had been 
speaking and studying the language for 
some time, I knew I had to keep my 
Spanish dictionary close to me when I 
read letters from my dad, written in 
his adopted native tongue, Spanish. 
While serving as a missionary there, 
he briefly met Janet Griffin, whom he 
would later marry and who was my 
mother. Janet was the daughter of an 
employee of the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. 
Treasury Attache in the Mexican Em-
bassy. 
While they didn’t interact much 
then, they reconnected when they were 
both back at Brigham Young Univer-
sity about 6 or 8 months later. It 
wasn’t exactly love at first sight for 
my mom, but it was for my dad. They 
went on to have seven children to-
gether, and I am grateful that they did. 
I am the fourth of those seven. 
My dad ended up going to law school 
at the University of Chicago. As it

March 11, 2021 
turned out, the law suited him well. He 
liked it, and it liked him back. He 
ended up finishing first in his class at 
the University of Chicago. He clerked 
at the U.S. Supreme Court for Justice 
White. Shortly after that, he joined the 
Phoenix law firm of Jennings, Strouss 
& Salmon and represented clients, both 
big and small, individual and cor-
porate, mostly civil but also some 
criminal cases. 
But he loved the law. He loved the 
opportunity that he had to represent 
clients. He loved the challenge that 
each case brought him. He loved the 
opportunity to digest large volumes of 
information and condense it down into 
a single legal brief and then into a sin-
gle 
oral 
argument 
that 
he 
could 
present in court. 
His enthusiasm was so intense that 
once in a while a judge would pull him 
aside afterward and ask him why he 
was so intense about the case, and he 
would respond by saying: OK, I will try 
to dial down the intensity next time. 
Little by little, he became more con-
versant in court, never to the point of 
being chatty or inappropriately famil-
iar, but at a point where he felt he was 
able to have a conversation with the 
judge and able to communicate to the 
judge the facts and the law of the case 
in a simple way. 
As they were raising their seven chil-
dren, there were a lot of things that 
were unexpected in life, including 
seven very loud, rambunctious chil-
dren; including the fact that one day, 
as he was practicing law in Phoenix, he 
got a phone call informing him that 
Brigham Young University would be 
opening a law school and they wanted 
him to be its founding dean. I was just 
1 year old at the time. 
That is how my family ended up in 
Utah. We ended up being connected to 
Brigham Young University basically 
for the rest of my life ever since then. 
My dad, in addition to serving as the 
dean of BYU’s law school, served as the 
Assistant Attorney General during the 
Ford administration, over the Civil Di-
vision of the Department of Justice. 
And during President Reagan’s first 
term, he served as Solicitor General. 
This is when I had my first real expo-
sure to the law. 
I found during that era of my dad’s 
service that I could miss school once in 
a while if I asked my parents if I could 
just go with my dad to court. He would 
go into court, and it felt a little bit 
like sitting in an extended session of 
church in a different language. It may 
not sound exciting, but I was impressed 
by the majesty of the whole event. As 
much as anything, I was impressed by 
how much my dad generally enjoyed 
being in court and making arguments. 
He had a way of making it fun. 
After serving as Solicitor General of 
the United States, he went back to 
BYU and resumed his teaching career 
while simultaneously continuing to 
argue cases in front of the Supreme 
Court as a private practice litigator. 
It was during that period of time, in 
June of 1987, that my father, while at 
the peak of physical condition, an avid 
runner and marathoner, got the news 
that he had stage IV non-Hodgkin’s T- 
cell lymphoma, a pretty deadly and ad-
vanced form of cancer. With a young 
family still at home, this hit us pretty 
hard. We were afraid that we were 
going to lose him. 
Through the able help of some excel-
lent doctors and as a result of a fortu-
itous set of circumstances culminating 
in him receiving some experimental 
treatment then going on at the Na-
tional Cancer Institute and the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, they were 
able to prolong his life, and he lived 
nearly another 9 years. They put him 
into remission within a few months, 
very nearly losing him in the process, 
but then he came back. 
He had some of the best years of his 
life after that bout with cancer. It was 
just a couple of years after that that he 
was asked to serve as president of 
Brigham Young University. I still re-
member this happened shortly after I 
had been accepted as a freshman at 
BYU, just as I was graduating from law 
school. 
Later that summer, as I was pre-
paring to enter as a freshman at BYU, 
I got a letter in the mail. The letter 
was signed by my dad. It was a letter 
that welcomed me to the university 
and then ended with the words: ‘‘I look 
forward to meeting you on campus this 
fall.’’ So I put it on the refrigerator 
with a Post-it note, saying: ‘‘Dad, 
thanks so much for the really personal 
note.’’ 
My dad had a great sense of humor, 
and notwithstanding his love of law 
and his professional accomplishments, 
at home, he was just our dad and our 
friend. In fact, calling him just our dad 
doesn’t really even do it justice. He 
was someone who had so much energy 
and enthusiasm for life. 
When we were little kids, he would 
come home from work, and we played a 
great game. We called it ‘‘run around 
dad,’’ and we didn’t know that that 
wasn’t 
necessarily 
an 
entertaining 
game. We didn’t know that it probably 
wasn’t that fun for him, but we would 
run around him, and he would figure 
out ways to trip us, and it was hilar-
ious every single time it would happen. 
My mom would watch patiently in the 
corner, realizing that after four or five 
trips, someone was going to cry, but it 
all worked out OK. 
Our dad taught us to work hard. He 
taught us to be kind to each other and 
to others, and he did that not just 
through the profession of his faith with 
words—and there was that. Of course, 
he was a devoutly faithful father and 
husband, and he taught us to pray and 
to read and love the Scriptures, but he 
also taught us those things through his 
very actions. 
I remember when I was a boy and de-
cided that I wanted to set up a small 
business enterprise shoveling drive-
ways, and after a couple of particularly 
heavy 
snowstorms, 
I 
wasn’t 
sure 
whether I could complete all of the jobs 
that I had. He offered to be my inden-
tured servant. I graciously offered to 
pay him, but he said: No, this one is on 
me. You are not going to pay me. You 
can get paid, in fact, for the fact that 
I am going to work for you. It was a 
fantastic deal. It was one of my favor-
ite memories of my life because he had 
a lot of other things to do, but he chose 
to help me, not just to teach me to 
work but also so he could spend time 
with me, and it was a lot of fun. 
He loved amusement parks. He loved 
roller coasters, and he loved being real-
ly, really exceptionally, unusually, em-
barrassingly loud while going down 
said roller coasters. He loved to ride, 
and he loved every aspect of it, even 
when he knew how it was going to end. 
As my brother Tom once remarked, 
recalling the circumstance in which 
my brother Tom had asked my dad for 
the name of a particular tool that my 
dad was using while assembling a swing 
set, he said: Dad, what is that? 
My dad looked at it and couldn’t tell 
whether it was a wrench or something 
else. It was a specialized tool used only 
for a swing set. My dad said to him: I 
don’t know what it is called, but when 
you need one of those, nothing else will 
do. 
Tom later remarked, that same de-
scription can be used of my dad. There 
is not really a single word that you can 
place to describe him, but when you 
need one of him, nothing else will do. 
During most of the last 61⁄2 years of 
his life, he was serving as president of 
BYU. He stayed exceptionally busy. He 
even managed to argue a case or two in 
front of the Supreme Court every sin-
gle year he was serving as president of 
BYU, even though during most of that 
time his cancer had come back. It had 
come back in a slightly different 
form—slower growing but less treat-
able. 
Notwithstanding the pain that he 
was 
enduring 
and 
the 
discomfort 
caused by the treatment, he never lost 
his optimism, the zeal for his work, or 
his love for his family. He was such a 
blessing to all of us to watch him go 
through that. We didn’t feel sorry for 
him as much as we should have, but 
part of the reason we didn’t feel as 
sorry for him is that unless you really 
paid attention, you couldn’t tell he was 
in pain. He didn’t complain about it. It 
certainly didn’t slow him down, not at 
least until the very end. 
I will always remember, as if it were 
yesterday, the moment when I took 
him to the hospital for what I feared 
would be the last time, and indeed it 
was. Just a couple of weeks before his 
death, I was in my second year of law 
school, and my mom and my wife let 
me know that things weren’t going 
well and I needed to go and help my 
dad get to the hospital. 
As we were wheeling him into the 
hospital that day, I could hear him. He 
was almost unconscious. Once we got 
him into the hospital, they put an oxy-
gen mask over him. His voice was muf-
fled, but he was muffling something. I

S1496 
March 11, 2021 
listened closely, and because I was, by 
then, a second-year law student, I rec-
ognized some of the legal vernacular 
that he was using, and I quickly dis-
cerned, based on some of his appellate 
briefs that I recently had read, he was 
preparing for what he hoped and ex-
pected and genuinely believed would be 
his next argument before the U.S. Su-
preme Court. And I thought: Way to go. 
There to the bitter end, he is ready for 
what is next. He is ready to stand for 
vindicating the interests of his client 
and for doing his job and doing it well. 
At no moment during any of this, 
notwithstanding his service in edu-
cation, in government, and the practice 
of law, and his extended church service 
as a lay minister in my faith, did I ever 
feel that we were neglected as a family. 
To be sure, he was gone a fair amount 
of time. He was a busy man, but when 
he was home, he was 100 percent home. 
He was all in. He loved—or at least if 
he didn’t love it, he at least had us con-
vinced that he loved being at home and 
loved working with his kids, studying 
with them, and helping them with 
their homework. 
When someone serves you that well, 
that faithfully, and that consistently 
over that many years, it has an effect 
and a very positive one. To this day, I 
still, from time to time, hear his words 
echoing in my head reminding me to do 
things as best as I possibly can do 
them; reminding me, as a lawyer, when 
you are in court, when you have won 
your case and you know you have won 
it, he said sit down and don’t say an-
other word; reminding me that when 
you have got a choice between a ten- 
cent word and a three-dollar word, 
choose the ten-cent word every time if 
it will do the job; reminding me to be 
kind to others and that you will never 
regret doing so. He reminded me to 
give others the benefit of the doubt. 
Those are things that stick with all of 
us. 
So I know I speak certainly for my-
self and for my siblings—Diana, Tom, 
Wendy, Stephanie, Melissa, Christie, 
and my mom Janet—that we miss him. 
The State of Utah and the Western 
United States and the United States of 
America is a better place because of 
the fact that he was here. I will never 
forget, on the morning of March 11, 
1996—again, 
exactly 
25 
years 
ago 
today—I saw the Sun rising over the 
Wasatch Mountains to our east in 
Provo, UT. It was at that moment 
when I realized that it would likely be 
the last time the Sun would rise with 
my father on the Earth. The Sun has 
risen and set on that same mountain 
range many, many thousands of times 
since then, but we remain better off for 
the fact that he was here. 
If he were here, I would tell him: I 
miss you, Dad. I love you, and I thank 
you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last 
week the Congress passed and tomor-
row the President will sign into law 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, 
which includes $10 billion to respond to 
COVID–19 internationally. While this is 
a tiny fraction of the $1.9 trillion in the 
Rescue Plan, it is critically necessary. 
As long as the virus continues to 
spread and mutate into more trans-
missible and deadlier variants in other 
countries, it will remain a threat to 
Americans. 
Within that amount, $580 million is 
included to support the U.N. Global 
Humanitarian 
Response 
Plan 
for 
COVID–19 through U.S. voluntary con-
tributions to international organiza-
tions, including the World Health Orga-
nization, the World Food Programme, 
UNICEF, the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees, and other international 
organizations. 
UNICEF offers critical operations 
and technical assistance to ministries 
of health and education around the 
world as countries continue to adapt 
their health and education activities to 
meet COVID–19 protocols. UNICEF also 
focuses on strengthening risk commu-
nication and community engagement 
to ensure that women, children, and 
their families know how to prevent 
COVID–19; providing supplies to com-
munities and educational and health 
facilities to support the prevention and 
treatment 
of 
COVID–19, 
including 
WASH supplies and personal protective 
equipment; and ensuring that children 
and women have continued access to 
basic healthcare, education, child pro-
tection, 
and 
gender-based 
violence 
services, including ensuring access to 
immunizations, prenatal and postnatal 
care, and HIV care in an environment 
safe from infection by the virus. 
It is obvious that UNICEF has a crit-
ical role to play in the international 
COVID–19 response. The same can be 
said of the World Food Programme, 
UNHCR, and WHO. I am pleased that 
Congress was able to provide additional 
funding for these and other inter-
national organizations to support their 
lifesaving work. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
to talk about the passage of the his-
toric American Rescue Plan. This mon-
umental legislation will help us get 
this pandemic under control and help 
families and small businesses weather 
the economic crisis. It includes critical 
funding for vaccine production, testing, 
and additional PPE. It includes the re-
sources we need to help kids get back 
to school safely, enhanced unemploy-
ment to help workers who are suffering 
during this pandemic, food assistance 
for low-income families, and stimulus 
checks to help make ends meet with 
hours cut and expenses rising. It also 
makes long-overdue enhancements to 
EITC and CTC that will help lift mil-
lions of children out of poverty. And it 
provides resources to keep families in 
their homes during this pandemic. 
First, it provides critical assistance 
for renters and people experiencing or 
at risk of homelessness. Before the 
pandemic, an estimated 568,000 people, 
many with underlying health condi-
tions, were already experiencing home-
lessness. One out of four renters was 
paying more than half of their income 
in rent, leaving too many making im-
possible choices between essential ex-
penses or even at risk of eviction. 
COVID–19 has both revealed and exac-
erbated these housing problems. One 
out of five renters reports being behind 
on rent, and renters were an estimated 
$57 billion dollars behind on rent as of 
January. 
I am pleased that the Senate-ap-
proved bill includes new resources to 
assist people experiencing or at risk of 
homelessness through emergency hous-
ing vouchers and homelessness assist-
ance and supportive services adminis-
tered by the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, as well as 
emergency assistance for rural housing 
for residents of properties financed by 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
Rural Housing Service. 
In addition, the American Rescue 
Plan provides $21.6 billion in emer-
gency 
rental 
assistance 
through 
States, localities, and territories, in-
cluding $2.5 billion reserved for high- 
need grantees. 
This funding supplements the $25 bil-
lion in emergency rental assistance 
funding provided by Congress in De-
cember, Section 501 of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2021, Public Law 
116–260, Section 501, but includes addi-
tional flexibilities to ensure grantees 
can better stabilize renters. The Biden 
administration should again extend the 
Federal eviction moratorium that ex-
pires on March 31, 2021, so that grant-
ees have time to distribute assistance 
to renters in need to prevent evictions 
and displacement. 
With the emergency rental assistance 
provided in this bill, renters will be 
able to receive up to 18 months of fi-
nancial assistance, including future 
rent and utility payments, including 
pad rents in manufactured housing 
communities, and unpaid rent or util-
ity bills that have accumulated. Rent-
ers can also receive assistance for

other housing-related expenses nec-
essary to promote housing stability, 
such as but not limited to security de-
posits; relocation and rental fees for 
displaced households; late fees related 
to a former or current rental unit; and 
internet service provided to the rental 
unit. Section 3201 does not preclude 
grantees 
from 
continuing 
payment 
processes provided in section 501. These 
processes are the provisions that gov-
ern payments of rent and utility assist-
ance either to property owners and 
utilities or directly to tenants and the 
application for assistance by landlords 
and owners under subsection (f). Addi-
tionally, funds can be used to provide 
housing stability services, such as but 
not limited to case management; ten-
ant-landlord mediation; legal services 
related to eviction and housing sta-
bility; housing counseling; fair housing 
counseling; and specialized services for 
people with disabilities, people with 
chronic health conditions, seniors, or 
survivors 
of 
domestic 
violence 
or 
human trafficking. Similar to section 
501, section 3201 permits grantees to 
use a certain percentage of their funds 
on administrative costs to support eli-
gible program activities, including the 
provision of financial assistance and 
housing stability services. After de-
ducting the amount grantees may use 
on program administration, grantees 
may also use up to 10 percent of their 
funds on providing housing stability 
services. As in section 501, funds are 
provided to States to assist renters 
throughout the State, including in 
rural communities, as well as cities 
and counties that receive a direct allo-
cation. 
Given how badly these resources are 
needed, the Department of Treasury 
and grantees must do all they can to 
implement this rental assistance pro-
gram quickly and successfully and not 
create any artificial barriers to assist-
ance. With some benefits provided by 
the CARES Act, documentation re-
quirements to prove eligibility have 
erected artificial barriers that have cut 
people off from the benefits Congress 
intended them to receive. Indeed, di-
verse stakeholders, including tenant 
advocates, landlords, and State and 
local government agencies, have raised 
concerns that such requirements that 
have been applied in existing emer-
gency rental assistance programs have 
prevented renters from completing ap-
plications and are overly burdensome 
for program staff. It is critical that 
any renters who are struggling to pay 
their rent during the pandemic are not 
barred from accessing this assistance 
due to cumbersome documentation re-
quirements or other barriers. An appli-
cant’s simple attestation should be the 
only documentation required to meet 
program eligibility requirements. Ad-
ditionally, grantees may continue the 
income assessment procedures pursu-
ant to section 501 to determine eligi-
bility. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has had 
broad impacts on individuals, families, 
businesses, availability of government 
services and supports, and throughout 
our economy. It has changed where and 
how many people work. It has made it 
more difficult not just to keep a job 
but also to find a new job, to get 
enough hours, and to find childcare or 
someone to care for a sick loved one. 
All of these challenges brought on by 
the pandemic have made it more dif-
ficult for families to make ends meet. 
These effects are likely to exist for 
months and years to come. Given these 
factors, Treasury and grantees should 
broadly read the requirement regarding 
the connection between a renter’s 
hardship and the coronavirus pandemic 
when determining the eligibility of the 
renter. As the language states, the 
hardship must have occurred ‘‘during 
or due, directly or indirectly, to the 
coronavirus pandemic.’’ The economic 
effects of the pandemic will be felt long 
after the virus is contained. Certain in-
dustries and communities have been 
particularly hard-hit from the pan-
demic and will likely take years to re-
cover. Treasury should issue guidance 
that makes this point clear to ensure 
renters are not cut off from needed as-
sistance as they try to recover from 
economic downturns caused by the 
pandemic. 
Section 3201 also provides that after 
October 1, 2022, certain grantees may 
expend funds on ‘‘other affordable rent-
al housing and eviction prevention ac-
tivities’’ that benefit any very low-in-
come renter household. Such activities 
can include but are not limited to af-
fordable housing development, preser-
vation, or acquisition, and other forms 
of rental assistance and eviction pre-
vention activities targeted to very low- 
income renters. 
To ensure continuity in monitoring 
funds provided by section 3201 and sec-
tion 501 and ease of grantee implemen-
tation, Treasury should maintain the 
same reporting requirements that were 
included in section 501. 
The committee encourages the ad-
ministration to create and maintain a 
central public repository of informa-
tion on State and local rental assist-
ance programs, which at a minimum 
identifies the program’s administering 
agency and contact information, so 
that renters and landlords can more 
easily identify available assistance. 
Finally, to the extent there is any 
confusion with regard to the taxability 
of assistance, Treasury, in consultation 
with the Internal Revenue Service, 
should provide guidance to clarify this 
for grantees and program participants. 
The American Rescue Plan also pro-
vides vital home ownership assistance 
to families across the country. This 
much-needed assistance would not have 
been possible without the dedication 
and diligence of our colleague, Senator 
JACK REED, who is the author of the 
Homeowner Assistance Fund we have 
enacted. For nearly a year, he has been 
leading the charge to keep families in 
their homes and avoid another fore-
closure crisis, and I am grateful to him 
for his leadership on this issue. 
There is no question that home-
owners are struggling as a result of 
this pandemic. In January, more than 
3.3 million homeowners were more than 
30 days behind on their payments or in 
foreclosure. More than 2 million house-
holds are more than 3 months behind, 
putting them at risk of foreclosure. 
Many of these households are in for-
bearance, but others are not. And the 
number 
of 
homeowners 
behind 
on 
mortgage payments doesn’t account for 
other costs, such as utility and insur-
ance bills, that are building up not just 
for homeowners with a mortgage but 
also for the more than one-third of 
homeowners who own their home out-
right. 
Black, Latino, and Asian households 
are more likely to report that they 
have fallen behind on their mortgages. 
As with so much else in this health and 
economic crisis, the burden is falling 
the heaviest on the communities of 
color and low-income communities. 
We cannot repeat the mistakes of the 
past. We cannot allow this pandemic to 
become a housing crisis that exacer-
bates economic inequality and widens 
the racial home ownership gap. This 
time, we must give communities the 
tools to help homeowners weather this 
crisis and remain in their homes. 
Many homeowners who are in for-
bearance have loans backed by a Fed-
eral agency or Fannie Mae or Freddie 
Mac. Throughout this pandemic, these 
agencies have extended forbearance 
and post-forbearance options to help 
borrowers resume making regular pay-
ments at some point or get an afford-
able loan modification. Many bor-
rowers in forbearance today will also 
be able to get back on track with these 
existing options. But these options 
won’t 
help 
all 
homeowners. 
Many 
homeowners do not have the benefit of 
the loan workout options that come 
with a federally backed or Fannie Mae- 
or Freddie Mac-backed loan, have accu-
mulated other utility or housing costs, 
or have a manufactured home loan that 
is not a mortgage. And still other 
homeowners have a federally backed 
loan but, given the severe disruption to 
our economy, just need more help than 
is available through their mortgage 
program. These homeowners will need 
direct assistance, and they will need it 
quickly. 
That is exactly what the Homeowner 
Assistance Fund will do. The American 
Rescue Plan Act’s Homeowner Assist-
ance Fund creates a nearly $10 billion 
fund at the Department of the Treas-
ury to provide resources to States, 
Tribal governments, and Tribally des-
ignated housing entities to help home-
owners staying in their homes. Treas-
ury will allocate funds among the 
States and other eligible recipients, 
taking into account the number of in-
dividuals in a State who have been un-
employed in recent months, as well as 
the number of homeowners who have 
fallen at least a month behind on their 
mortgage, regardless of whether they 
are in forbearance, or who are in fore-
closure. States and eligible recipients

March 11, 2021 
will use the funds Congress has pro-
vided in this bill for direct relief to eli-
gible homeowners and to set up, staff, 
and administer the programs providing 
that relief. 
As Congress has established in the 
bill, direct relief through the Home-
owner Assistance Fund can include 
help with missed mortgage payments, 
financial help to make a mortgage 
modification viable, assistance with 
broadband and utility costs; and other 
relief that homeowners need to get 
back on track financially. At least 60 
percent of a State or other eligible en-
tity’s funds must go to households at 
or below 100 percent of area median in-
come or households below 100 percent 
of the national median income, which-
ever is higher, to ensure that help 
reaches those homeowners who need it 
most. Including homeowners with in-
comes of up to 100 percent of the na-
tional median income when that is 
higher than the area median income 
will ensure that funds adequately reach 
homeowners in Tribal areas and rural 
areas, where localized incomes may be 
lower. Remaining assistance funds are 
targeted to socially disadvantaged in-
dividuals, including homeowners of 
color, who too often are left behind in 
our economy and who data indicate are 
at disproportionate risk of foreclosure. 
While Congress has authorized the 
program, the intent is for Treasury to 
play a vital role in making this pro-
gram a reality by administering the 
Homeowner Assistance Fund prudently 
and flexibly to keep the greatest num-
ber of families in their homes. In the 
days ahead, Treasury must provide 
States and other eligible entities with 
the certainty they need to accept and 
distribute 
these 
funds 
efficiently. 
Treasury must set clear expectations 
for the types of eligible programs 
States can administer and the guide-
lines States must follow to administer 
these programs equitably and in ac-
cordance with the law. That includes 
ensuring States and other eligible enti-
ties understand up front that they can 
use a portion of the funds provided 
through the Homeowner Assistance 
Fund to establish and administer their 
programs, so that States can imme-
diately get the systems and staffing in 
place to put funds into the hands of the 
people who need them. And if there is 
any uncertainty among States or indi-
viduals who might apply for assistance, 
Treasury should immediately clarify 
that any assistance received through 
the Homeowner Assistance Fund is not 
income for a homeowner. 
Treasury must also establish report-
ing to ensure that funds are reaching 
the households who need them most. 
Both to comply with the law and to en-
sure funds are being used equitably, 
Treasury must establish periodic pub-
lic reporting by State of key metrics, 
including the amount of funds dis-
bursed, the acceptance rate of appli-
cants, reasons applicants are denied, 
the number of individuals assisted, the 
number of households assisted by in-
come range, the types of assistance 
provided, the average amount of assist-
ance per household, and household out-
comes. These data should also be as-
sessed by race, ethnicity, gender, and 
other factors to determine compliance 
with all laws, including the Fair Hous-
ing Act. While Fair Housing Act en-
forcement remains the jurisdiction of 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development and the Department of 
Justice, this program and all housing 
programs must be developed and ad-
ministered 
to 
comply 
with 
this 
foundational civil rights law. 
States and other eligible recipients 
will also be vital partners in getting re-
lief out quickly. Too many home-
owners have been struggling for nearly 
a year. We need to get them relief now. 
Following the 2008 economic crisis, 
State housing finance agencies in se-
lect States were great partners in pro-
viding direct relief to homeowners 
through the Hardest Hit Fund. In my 
home State of Ohio, the Ohio Housing 
Finance Agency helped tens of thou-
sands of people with mortgage payment 
assistance, modifications with assist-
ance, and more. We need all States to 
be prepared to get these funds out 
quickly and without unnecessary bar-
riers. Treasury can help facilitate this 
with clear guidance and templates that 
allow States to put out funds without 
delay. 
I will continue to fight for the assist-
ance people experiencing homelessness, 
renters, and homeowners need to stay 
in their homes. I also look forward to 
working to successfully deploy the his-
toric resources provided in this bill.

CONFIRMATION OF MERRICK 
BRIAN GARLAND 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to voice my support 
for the President’s nominee for Attor-
ney General, Judge Merrick Garland, 
who is not only a fellow Marylander, 
but somebody I have known personally 
for many years. And I know that Presi-
dent Biden has picked a nominee with 
impeccable credentials and unimpeach-
able 
character. 
His 
experience 
stretches from the halls of the Justice 
Department to the chambers of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit, and he embodies 
the decency, the impartiality, and the 
commitment to justice that our Nation 
deserves as the Attorney General of the 
United States. I am confident that 
Judge Garland will serve admirably 
and faithfully as the next Attorney 
General. 
The Nation already knows Merrick 
Garland because of his Supreme Court 
nomination and as the former Judge of 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Dis-
trict of Columbia Circuit, where he 
earned a reputation as one of our Na-
tion’s finest and fairest jurists. But his 
tenure on the D.C. Circuit was just the 
most recent achievement in a life dedi-
cated to serving the rule of law. After 
excelling at law school, Judge Garland 
clerked for the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals and then for the Supreme 
Court. He then rose through the ranks 
of a prominent law firm before jumping 
back into public service feet-first as a 
Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office during the administration 
of President George Herbert Walker 
Bush and then later served as the Prin-
cipal Associate Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral at the Department of Justice. 
As a senior DOJ official, Judge Gar-
land was tasked with overseeing the 
case of the Oklahoma City bombing, 
one of the deadliest domestic terrorist 
attacks in American history. It left 168 
Americans dead and hundreds more in-
jured. 
Merrick 
Garland 
brought 
a 
steady hand to an operation that in-
volved massive amounts of evidence, 
pressure from the public, and a large 
team with diverse skills and back-
grounds. With fidelity to the law and 
meticulous attention to detail and un-
relenting 
focus, 
Merrick 
Garland 
helped bring the bomber, Timothy 
McVeigh, to justice. He has called this 
case the most important thing he has 
done in his life. 
Mr. Chairman, ranking member, and 
committee members, we are going to 
need his experience as we once again 
confront the rise of domestic ter-
rorism, particularly in the wake of the 
horrific events of January 6. And the 
next Attorney General must not only 
take on the rise of White supremacists 
and radical militia groups, but also en-
sure that justice is rendered equally 
and fairly by promoting and ensuring 
racial equity, rooting out discrimina-
tion in our criminal justice system, ad-
dressing police reform, and ensuring 
that we don’t see a concerted effort to 
limit people’s citizens’ right to vote in 
the United States of America. As Jus-
tice Garland has himself stated, ensur-
ing the rule of law and making real the 
promise of equal justice under the law 
are ‘‘the great principles upon which 
the Department of Justice was founded 
and for which it must always stand.’’ 
Judge Garland has spent his career 
doing both, and I have no doubt he will 
honor that tradition as Attorney Gen-
eral. 
During Judge Garland’s confirmation 
hearing his commitment to public 
service and ensuring equal justice were 
on display. He shared that he felt an 
obligation to payback our country for 
protecting and welcoming his grand-
parents who fled to the United States 
to escape anti-Semitism and persecu-
tion. He stated that serving as an At-
torney General that combats injustice 
and discrimination would be ‘‘the high-
est, best use of my own set of skills.’’ 
While his professional experiences 
have prepared him for this job, it is his 
character that makes him right for 
this moment. Should he be confirmed, 
Judge Garland will be charged with re-
storing credibility and independence to 
the Department of Justice, making it 
clear that the Department is not the 
political 
instrument 
of 
the 
White 
House. I know Merrick Garland is up to

the 
task. 
The 
lengthy 
list 
of 
testimonials speaking to his fairness 
and sound judgement span the political 
spectrum. He is respected by law-
makers, scholars, and lawyers of every 
legal persuasion and political philos-
ophy. And on a personal note, I can at-
test to the fact that his brilliance is 
matched by his kindness. His many 
achievements have never gone to his 
head. He has always stayed humble and 
treated everyone with respect. 
It is for these reasons and many more 
that I was honored to vote for the 
President’s nominee to serve as the 
next Attorney General of the United 
States, Judge Merrick Garland. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF MICHAEL 
STANLEY REGAN 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, now is the time to take sub-
stantive action to combat climate 
change, address environmental justice, 
and help clean up the Chesapeake Bay. 
To help address these critical issues, 
President Biden nominated Michael 
Regan to be Administrator of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency. 
Michael Regan most recently served 
as secretary of the North Carolina De-
partment of Environmental Quality. 
During that time, Mr. Regan led the 
implementation of North Carolina’s 
Executive Order 80, a landmark effort 
to address climate change’s impact and 
transition the State’s energy economy. 
Mr. Regan also created North Caro-
lina’s first Environmental Justice and 
Equity Advisory Board to address soci-
etal disparities exacerbated by envi-
ronmental issues during his tenure as 
secretary. 
Mr. Regan has a strong record of bi-
partisanship, having previously served 
at the EPA under both Democratic and 
Republican Presidents. He is com-
mitted to rebuilding EPA’s Federal 
workforce, which saw record depar-
tures during the Trump administra-
tion. During the Trump administra-
tion, we saw the EPA workforce shrink 
to levels not seen since the Reagan ad-
ministration, and those who resigned 
or retired include some of the Agency’s 
most experienced scientific veterans, 
as well as young environmental experts 
who traditionally would have replaced 
them, causing a brain drain at the 
EPA. Maryland is home to many of 
those Federal employees, and I look 
forward to working with Mr. Regan to 
rebuild the civil servant backbone of 
the EPA. 
One of EPA’s most critical roles for 
the State of Maryland is its role in the 
cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay. We are 
at a very critical junction in the imple-
mentation of the Chesapeake Bay 
Agreement and our mutual goal of 
clean water in the Chesapeake Bay by 
2025. On December 29, 2010, the U.S. En-
vironmental Protection Agency estab-
lished the Chesapeake Bay Total Max-
imum Daily Load—TMDL—a historic 
and comprehensive agreement that in-
cludes accountability features to re-
store clean water in the seven jurisdic-
tions within the Chesapeake Bay wa-
tershed. The agreement is a national 
and indeed international model for wa-
tershed restoration. It sets limits for 
pollution that equate to a 25-percent 
reduction in nitrogen, 24-percent reduc-
tion in phosphorous, and 20-percent re-
duction in sediment. As the Bay TMDL 
states, ‘‘The TMDL is designed to en-
sure that all pollution control meas-
ures needed to fully restore the Bay 
and its tidal rivers are in place by 
2025[.]’’ 
I look forward to working with Mr. 
Regan to make sure that EPA uses 
every tool available to them, including 
enforcement measures when necessary, 
to make sure that all jurisdictions are 
on track for our mutual goal of clean 
water in the Chesapeake Bay by 2025. 
Furthermore, I am pleased that Mr. 
Regan has indicated that he will recon-
stituting the position of Senior Advisor 
to the Administrator of the EPA for 
the Chesapeake Bay. 
I believe that Michael Regan is a 
strong choice to lead us into a new era 
at the EPA. For these reasons, I sup-
ported Michael Regan’s nomination as 
the Administrator of the EPA.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DENNIS DAVIES 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Madam President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Dennis Davies of Lewis and Clark 
County for his compassion and dedica-
tion to his community during the pan-
demic. While schools were closed to in- 
person instruction, Dennis saw that 
students needed a place to do their 
work at home. He rose to the occasion 
and began building desks for young 
Montanans enrolled in virtual school. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic hit, 
Dennis was inspired by a TV segment 
that profiled a teacher from Iowa who 
made desks for students and thought 
he could do the same for Montana’s 
students. 
At first, he paid desk supply expenses 
out of his own pocket. After the com-
munity recognized the service he was 
providing, donations began rolling in. 
Now, with the assistance of donated 
supplies and funds, he is able to expand 
his operation and build even more 
desks for kids. Dennis works alongside 
many Montanans who volunteer their 
time to help him build and deliver 
desks, and he hopes to provide 2,000 
desks to students across the State. 
Though that amount may be daunting, 
he is excited to help do his part to help 
Montana families get through the pan-
demic. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Dennis for his compassion and dedica-
tion to the people of Lewis and Clark 
County in this trying time. His kind-
ness and charitable approach to work 
serves as an inspiration to all Mon-
tanans.∑

S. 697. A bill to require the Secretary 
of the Treasury to mint commemora-
tive coins in recognition of the Bicen-
tennial of Harriet Tubman’s birth; to 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to 
celebrate Harriet Tubman, one of the 
most notable individuals in Maryland’s 
history. Congress began officially rec-
ognizing March 10th as Harriet Tub-
man Day in 1990 and I am always grate-
ful to speak to her accomplishments. 
Throughout her life she served as an 
abolitionist, soldier, spy and, most fa-
mously, as a conductor on the Under-
ground Railroad. I would like to reflect 
on her contributions to human rights, 
civil rights, and women’s rights in our 
Nation and to renew my commitment 
to addressing the shameful legacy of 
slavery in Maryland and across the 
U.S.—particularly as it pertains to en-
vironmental justice. 
Harriet Tubman was born Araminta 
Ross to enslaved parents in Bucktown, 
Maryland in 1822. After emancipating 
herself, she dedicated her life to the ad-
vancement of freedom and the fight 
against slavery. Araminta adopted the 
name ‘‘Harriet’’ at the time of her mar-
riage to John Tubman, a free Black 
man, around the year 1844. Tubman and 
her husband continued to live in Dor-
chester County until her escape from 
slavery in 1849, at the age of 27. She 
would courageously return to make 
over thirteen dangerous trips to lead 
nearly 70 enslaved people seeking free-
dom, repeatedly risking her life in pur-
suit of our Nation’s highest aspira-
tional ideal. 
Throughout the American Civil War, 
Tubman served the Union at various 
times as a cook, nurse, scout, and even 
spy. 
She 
helped 
orchestrate 
the 
Combahee River raid in South Carolina 
that freed over 700 enslaved men, 
women, and children. After the war’s 
end, Harriet focused her efforts on 
women’s suffrage. In 1908, Tubman es-
tablished the Harriet Tubman Home 
for the Aged in Auburn, New York. 
Five years later, she died of pneumonia 
on March 10, 1913. Although she spent 
her final decades in New York, the 
marshes and forests of Maryland’s 
Eastern Shore are where Harriet Tub-
man first grew spiritually and phys-
ically strong. 
Harriet Tubman made an indelible 
impact on my State and our Nation’s 
history and I am proud to have played 
a role in memorializing her story to fu-
ture generations. I worked to secure 
the authorities and funding for the 
Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad 
Byway, which tells the story of her life 
in Dorchester and Caroline counties, 
and for the Harriet Tubman Under-
ground National Historical Park. The 
National Park Service administers the 
national historical park Congress cre-
ated in December 2014 and the national 
monument authorized by President 
Obama in 2013 as a single unit. The 
Park Service works in partnership with 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
which manages the Blackwater Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge, and the State of 
Maryland, which owns and co-manages 
the Harriet Tubman Underground Rail-
road Visitor Center, to commemorate 
and interpret Tubman’s remarkable 
story. 
Visitors 
can 
access 
the 
marshlands, largely preserved since her 
time, at the Visitor Center and nearby 
Refuge. The Harriet Tubman Under-
ground Railroad National Historical 
Park centers her life’s work not in 
physical 
structures, 
but 
instead 
through the landscape in Tubman’s na-
tive Dorchester County, which we must 
defend against the social and ecologi-
cal hazards of climate change. 
While climate change is a global 
issue, it is felt on a local scale. Dor-
chester County’s low-lying landscape of

March 11, 2021 
tidal marshes, narrow peninsulas, and 
country roads linking isolated commu-
nities is threatened by sea level rise 
and land subsidence. Over one-half of 
the county lies in the 100–year flood-
plain, much of it in the tidal flood-
plain; even minor storms and routine 
high-tide events can flood vast portions 
of the county. In addition to flooding, 
saltwater intrusion threatens the fail-
ure of rural septic systems, and dam-
age to roads, bridges, and other critical 
infrastructure. Climate-driven changes 
to the coastal ecosystem are also mak-
ing it harder to earn a living through 
the primary local sources of income: 
agriculture, forestry, and the seafood 
industry. 
Local communities are at the front-
line of adaptation, and initial social in-
equality 
causes 
the 
disadvantaged 
groups in those communities to suffer 
disproportionately from the adverse ef-
fects of climate change, resulting in 
greater subsequent inequality. Dor-
chester County is no exception. After 
the Civil War, freedmen and women 
settled the land, which was often less 
arable and therefore more affordable. 
Today, the county has a population of 
32,000, 26 percent of whom are Black. 
Black individuals are almost twice as 
likely to be unemployed or live below 
the federal poverty level as their white 
neighbors, attributable to systemic 
racism that has roots in Harriet Tub-
man’s time of enslavement. The Union 
of Concerned Scientists developed a 
Climate Equity Tool to identify com-
munities that face conditions that 
heighten their vulnerability to harm 
and are therefore high-risk environ-
mental justice areas, including Dor-
chester County. UCS projects that the 
county will see a six-inch rise in sea 
level by 2030 and 13–inch rise by 2045. 
Absent national or international cli-
mate policy direction under the Trump 
administration, cities and towns on the 
Eastern Shore and around the world 
have been focusing on solving their 
own climate problems. They are work-
ing to build flood defenses, plan for 
heatwaves and higher temperatures, in-
stall water-permeable pavement to bet-
ter deal with floods and stormwater, 
and improve water storage and use. 
Dorchester County has a flood mitiga-
tion plan that identifies projects to 
protect resources at risk of being lost, 
including historic and cultural sites. 
However, implementation of such plans 
requires significant funding. It is es-
sential that Congress enhance the re-
silience of vulnerable communities in 
Dorchester County and across the 
Eastern Shore—and the Nation—whose 
residents have been forced to manage 
periodic flooding and other climate im-
pacts in relative social and political 
isolation. Frontline communities in 
Dorchester and neighboring Eastern 
Shore counties with strong historical 
and cultural ties require sufficient fed-
eral financial and technical assistance 
now to help plan for the future and 
make choices about how best to pro-
tect themselves from tidal flooding, 
saltwater intrusion, and coastal disas-
ters. 
Environmental justice is an essential 
component to carry on with respect to 
the anti-racist work that Harriet Tub-
man pioneered. The American Rescue 
Plan Act will provide debt relief and 
assistance to socially disadvantaged 
farmers and ranchers who have faced 
disproportionate impacts from the pan-
demic as a result of longstanding dis-
crimination, as well as $50 million in 
funding to reduce the air pollution that 
is linked with contributing to COVID– 
19 deaths, targeted to low income com-
munities and communities of color. 
These provisions present only a small 
down payment on the types invest-
ments needed to address inequality, 
and have yet to squarely address cli-
mate change. 
The local communities on the East-
ern Shore that served as Harriet Tub-
man’s training ground in resistance are 
rarely credited for their outsized influ-
ence on Maryland’s maritime industry, 
culture, and environment. We must do 
better to enshrine their place in our 
historical consciousness and provide 
them with the tools necessary to pre-
pare for climate change. I am grateful 
for the opportunity to showcase the ex-
ceptional efforts of one particular 
Marylander and honor her by pursuing 
climate 
and 
environmental 
justice 
policies. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
CARDIN, and Mrs. SHAHEEN): 
S. 723. A bill to amend the Small 
Business Act and the CARES Act to ex-
tend the covered period for the pay-
check protection program, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the PPP Extension Act of 
2021. I’m pleased to be joined in intro-
ducing this bill by my colleagues, Sen-
ators 
CARDIN
and 
SHAHEEN. 
Last 
March, the three of us, along with Sen-
ator RUBIO, formed a Small Business 
Task Force that crafted the Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP)—a forgiv-
able loan program designed to help 
keep small employers afloat and their 
employees paid during the pandemic. 
The bipartisan bill that we are intro-
ducing today would simply extend the 
current application deadline for new 
PPP loans from March 31st to May 31st 
of this year, and then provide an addi-
tional 30-day period during which time 
the Small Business Administration 
may continue processing applications 
received prior to the new May 31st 
deadline. Representatives VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
LUETKEMEYER, BOURDEAUX, and KIM 
(CA) have introduced a companion bill 
in the House. 
The PPP has been hugely successful 
in helping our Nation’s small busi-
nesses and nonprofits survive the pan-
demic and continue paying their em-
ployees. In 2020, more than five million 
small employers received forgivable 
PPP loans, helping to sustain upwards 
of 50 million American jobs. This in-
cludes more than 28,000 Maine small 
businesses, who received nearly $2.3 bil-
lion in forgivable PPP loans. 
Recognizing the importance of this 
program for our Nation’s small em-
ployers, the bipartisan December 2020 
COVID-relief law provided an addi-
tional $284.5 billion to reopen the Pay-
check Protection Program and allow 
the hardest hit small employers to re-
ceive a second forgivable loan. The De-
cember law also made other improve-
ments to the PPP, such as expanding 
forgivable overhead expenses to include 
supplier costs and investments in facil-
ity modifications and personal protec-
tive equipment needed to operate safe-
ly. 
Since reopening in January, more 
than two million additional forgivable 
loans—totaling nearly $165 billion— 
have been approved for small busi-
nesses across the Nation. In Maine, 
more than 10,000 small employers have 
been approved for more than $692 mil-
lion in forgivable loans since PPP’s re-
opening. In total, Maine small employ-
ers have been approved for nearly $3 
billion in forgivable loans since the 
program was created last year. 
I have heard from countless small 
employers about the impact this pro-
gram has had on them and their em-
ployees. The owner of Shipyard Brew-
ing Company in Portland told me that 
without the relief that PPP provided, 
his company would be bankrupt. The 
Ecology School, a non-profit environ-
mental education program in Saco, 
would have had to lay off the majority 
of its staff without the support of two 
forgivable PPP loans. I’ve heard from 
the owners of Jeff’s Catering in Brewer, 
the Poland Spring Resort, and the 
Hamilton Marine in Searsport that 
PPP helped keep their businesses alive 
and their employees paid. 
With the ongoing distribution of 
COVID–19 vaccines and the promise of 
warmer weather throughout the Na-
tion, there is a light at the end of the 
tunnel. We’re not there yet, which is 
why we need to extend the deadline to 
apply for new loans. Extending the 
deadline would also help address con-
cerns I continue to hear from Maine 
small employers about delays in the 
processing of new loan applications be-
cause of difficulty in resolving error 
messages generated by the Small Busi-
ness Administration computer system. 
By extending the PPP for another 
two months and then providing an ad-
ditional 30 days after that time for the 
SBA to process applications that are 
still pending, this bill would help our 
Nation’s small employers retain access 
to forgivable PPP loans. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KAINE, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. WARNER, 
Mr. REED, Ms. ROSEN, and Mrs. SHA-
HEEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 105 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the Govern-
ment of Burma was overthrown by the Bur-
mese army, or Tatmadaw, returning the 
same army responsible for the genocidal 
military campaign against the Rohingya 
people to a greater position of power and au-
thority, at least temporarily; 
Whereas the hundreds of thousands of Bur-
mese citizens who have taken peacefully to 
the streets to protest the coup have been 
met with increasingly brutal displays of 
force by the Tatmadaw and the Myanmar 
Police Force, and over 50 citizens have been 
killed to date; 
Whereas, since the February 2021 coup, the 
Tatmadaw-enforced media and communica-
tions blackouts and travel limits are lim-
iting the ability of journalists and humani-
tarian actors to provide services or monitor 
the safety and security of people across 
Burma, 
including 
approximately 
600,000 
Rohingya remaining in Rakhine State; 
Whereas media reports that the Burmese 
military have recently blocked shipments of 
humanitarian assistance intended for per-
sons displaced by the ongoing offensive and 
militarization in the ethnic states; 
Whereas recently announced United States 
sanctions target Tatmadaw actors specifi-
cally for their role in the coup, but ethnic 
minorities living within Burmese borders 
have suffered a wide range of systematic 
abuse and discrimination for many years; 
Whereas, since August 25, 2017, approxi-
mately 740,000 Rohingya have fled from 
Burma to escape the Burmese military and 
security force’s well-documented and sys-
tematic campaign of persecution and atroc-
ities; 
Whereas most of the Rohingya fled to 
neighboring Bangladesh, resulting in the cre-
ation of the world’s largest and most densely 
populated refugee camp, while others es-
caped to India, Thailand, Malaysia, and 
other parts of South and Southeast Asia; 
Whereas, on December 3, 2018, the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum con-
cluded that ‘‘there is compelling evidence 
that the Burmese military committed ethnic 
cleansing, crimes against humanity, and 
genocide against the Rohingya’’; 
Whereas the May 2019 Amnesty Inter-
national report on war crimes in Rakhine 
State outlines continued human rights viola-
tions, including ‘‘indiscriminate attacks’’ on 
civilians, and expresses alarm about the im-
pact of continued fighting on the food secu-
rity of Rakhine State; 
Whereas then-United Nations High Com-
missioner for Refugees Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein 
testified that the Tatmadaw’s brutal cam-
paign against the Rohingya was a ‘‘textbook 
example of ethnic cleansing’’ and ‘‘without 
regard for basic principles of international 
law’’; 
Whereas, in his nomination hearing, Sec-
retary of State Antony Blinken stated that 
he would oversee an interagency review to 
determine whether Burma’s crimes against 
the Rohingya amount to genocide; 
Whereas, after many years of hosting hun-
dreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees 
while bearing other internal challenges, 
media report that the Government of Ban-
gladesh is growing weary of hosting the 
Rohingya, building new barriers to restrict 
the ability for Rohingyas to work, access 
education, buy SIM cards, learn the local 
language, exercise their right to freedom of 
expression, including peaceful assembly, or 
move freely; 
Whereas, in a step toward reducing the ref-
ugee population on the mainland, the Gov-
ernment of Bangladesh has relocated over 
10,000 Rohingya from Cox’s Bazar to Bhasan 
Char, a flood-prone island in the Bay of Ben-
gal, but has denied the United Nations access 
to the island and the ability to undertake 
independent technical and protection assess-
ments to verify whether the island is safe 
and habitable to host this vulnerable popu-
lation; 
Whereas it has not been verified that 
Rohingya refugees’ ongoing relocation to 
Bhasan Char is fully informed and voluntary, 
as required under international law; 
Whereas the United Nations Refugee Agen-
cy reports that 2,400 Rohingya refugees chose 
dangerous boat journeys to escape their lim-
ited futures in Bangladesh over the last year, 
leading to at least 200 deaths and missing 
persons; 
Whereas efforts to force the return to 
Burma of more than 800,000 Rohingya refu-
gees now living in Bangladesh would con-
stitute a gross violation of international 
human rights law and would come at in-
creased risk during this time of political in-
stability and military rule; 
Whereas the fundamental operational prin-
ciples of voluntary repatriation must be 
based on informed consent, legal and phys-
ical safety, dignity, and the absence of any 
form of coercion, economic or otherwise, as 
well as the full protection of the returnees’ 
human rights, including the right to restore 
their citizenship status in Burma; 
Whereas approximately 236,000 Rohingya 
refugees returned to Burma from Bangladesh 
under the terms of a 1992 agreement after a 
previous 
bout 
of 
violence 
against 
the 
Rohingya forced them to flee, only to face 
continued denial of restoration of their citi-
zenship, prejudice, violence, and persecution, 
and in many instances forced to live in inter-
nally displaced persons camps with their 
freedom of movement restricted; 
Whereas 
Burma’s 
1982 
citizenship 
law 
stripped Rohingya of their Burmese citizen-
ship, rendering them stateless; 
Whereas the Government of Burma con-
tinues 
to 
systematically 
discriminate 
against the Rohingya people, including by 
restricting registration of Rohingya births 
and denying them freedom of movement as 
well as access to healthcare, land, education, 
marriage, voting rights, and political par-
ticipation; 
Whereas, on November 23, 2017, the Govern-
ment of Burma and the Government of Ban-
gladesh signed an agreement, known as the 
‘‘Arrangement’’, on the return of displaced 
persons from Rakhine State, which is mod-
eled after the 1992 repatriation agreement 
between Burma and Bangladesh; 
Whereas the Arrangement includes ref-
erences to restoring normalcy and human 
rights in Rakhine State, ensuring refugee re-
turns comply with international standards of 
safety, dignity, and voluntariness, and com-
mencing a process to address root causes in 
line with the Rakhine Advisory Commission 
recommendations; 
Whereas 
Rohingya 
refugees 
currently 
hosted in Bangladesh demonstrated in pro-
test against an initial November 2018 repatri-
ation plan between the Governments of Ban-
gladesh and Burma, citing concerns for their 
security and the lack of meaningful political 
reforms in Burma to include restoration of 
their full citizenship; and 
Whereas, following the 2021 coup, human 
rights groups, humanitarian actors, and ref-
ugees in Cox’s Bazar continue to express 
grave concerns about the heightened risk for 
a renewed campaign of genocide in Burma, 
calling for a halt to any efforts to move or 
adjust the status of any Rohingya persons: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the February 1, 2021, military 
coup that deposed an elected government 
and cast a pall over years of hope, invest-
ment, and progress toward a more demo-
cratic and free Burma; 
(2) expresses deep concern for the safety 
and security of the hundreds of thousands of 
Burmese people who have taken to the 
streets to protest the coup, and condemns 
the Tatmadaw and the Myanmar Police 
Force for their acts of terrorism against Bur-
ma’s civilian populations; 
(3) calls on Burmese authorities to allow 
journalists, 
human 
rights 
organizations, 
United Nations monitors, and humanitarian 
actors full and safe access to every part of 
the country, including Rakhine State, to en-
sure that humanitarian needs of all inter-
nally displaced persons are being met and 
that human rights of every population in 
Burma, including ethnic minorities, can be 
monitored and protected; 
(4) asks the governments of countries 
neighboring Burma, including Bangladesh 
and Thailand, to provide immediate, direct 
cross-border assistance to adequately ad-
dress humanitarian needs of all refugees suf-
fering from ongoing Burma Army militariza-
tion and offensives; 
(5) welcomes steps by the Government of 
Bangladesh and other neighboring states to 
receive Rohingya refugees, but raises sub-
stantial concern regarding reports of refu-
gees being turned away or moved into hold-
ing centers, as well as for the health and 
safety of all refugees, including those cur-
rently living in camps at Cox’s Bazar and 
Bhasan Char; 
(6) appeals to Bangladesh and other coun-
tries in the region to commit to providing 
safe harbor for Rohingya refugees, until 
their human rights, including their right to 
restoration of full citizenship, can be guaran-
teed; 
(7) calls on international organizations and 
all host governments, including the Govern-
ment of Bangladesh, to ensure improved ac-
cess for Rohingya refugees to basic services, 
education, and livelihood opportunities; 
(8) asks the Government of Bangladesh to 
allow the international community, includ-
ing the United Nations and other human 
rights and humanitarian actors, full and 
complete access to all Rohingya in Ban-
gladesh while refraining from any forced re-
location of Rohingya refugees into tem-
porary settlements or other ‘‘model vil-
lages’’; 
(9) urges the Government of Bangladesh to 
grant the United Nations access to conduct 
independent, comprehensive technical and 
protection assessments of Bhasan Char and 
to verify that any relocations of Rohingya 
refugees to Bhasan Char are voluntary and 
done with fully informed consent;

Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Ms. COLLINS, 
and Mr. HAGERTY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 106 
Whereas the Girl Scout Movement was 
founded on March 12, 1912, in Savannah, 
Georgia, by Juliette Gordon Low, whose life 
mission was to build girls of courage, con-
fidence, and character who make the world a 
better place; 
Whereas Girl Scouts of the United States 
of America (in this preamble, referred to as 
‘‘Girl Scouts’’) has emphasized public serv-
ice, civic engagement, and fostering a sense 
of community in girls across the country for 
over a century; 
Whereas Girl Scouts works to champion 
the ambitions, cultivate the talents, and de-
velop the skills of girls to be leaders in their 
communities and in the world; 
Whereas, in these challenging times, Girl 
Scouts provides community, consistency, 
and connection for girls and a safe haven 
through uncertainty; 
Whereas, in the time of COVID–19, Girl 
Scouts offers girls a place to safely connect 
and share experiences with ‘‘Girl Scouts at 
Home’’ and other skill-building digital pro-
gramming and adventures as they continue 
their Girl Scouts journeys; 
Whereas Girl Scouts has made many pro-
grams available to all girls, regardless of 
membership, as Girl Scouts embraces the 
role it plays in enhancing girls’ educational 
journeys, especially at a time when their 
lives are disrupted by the pandemic; 
Whereas Girl Scouts have continued to 
make a positive difference in their commu-
nities during the pandemic by creating 
masks, safely delivering Girl Scout Cookies 
to first responders and health care profes-
sionals, collecting goods for local food 
banks, and other active, creative ways that 
demonstrate concern and commitment to 
their fellow citizens; 
Whereas Girl Scouts believe in sisterhood, 
justice, and fairness by committing to make 
the world a more equitable place for all girls, 
no matter their race, ethnicity, or religion; 
Whereas, at a time when civics education 
is missing from many schools, Girl Scouts 
introduced new K–12 Civics badges to bring 
girls experiences that deepen their under-
standing of democracy and government, pre-
pare them for a lifetime of civic engagement, 
and motivate them to be catalysts for 
change; 
Whereas Girl Scouts offers girls 21st cen-
tury programming in science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM), as well as 
the outdoors, entrepreneurship, and beyond, 
helping girls develop invaluable life skills 
and take the lead early and often; 
Whereas Girl Scouts in grades 9 through 12 
can advance their civic engagement by earn-
ing the Gold Award, the most highly re-
garded award in the world for girls; 
Whereas Gold Award Girl Scouts take on 
projects that have a measurable and sustain-
able impact on a community by assessing a 
need, designing a solution, completing a 
project, and inspiring others to sustain it; 
Whereas, each year, Girl Scouts selects 10 
exceptionally inspiring Gold Award Girl 
Scouts, nominated by local councils, as Na-
tional Gold Award Girl Scouts; 
Whereas National Gold Award Girl Scouts 
have completed projects that demonstrate 
extraordinary leadership, have a measurable 
and sustainable effect, and address a local 
challenge relating to a national or global 
issue; and 
Whereas the 2020 National Gold Award Girl 
Scouts hail from regions throughout the 
country, including Los Alamos, New Mexico, 
Chesapeake, Virginia, Greensboro, North 
Carolina, Johns Creek, Georgia, Downers 
Grove, Illinois, Bakersfield, California, Ke-
nosha, 
Wisconsin, 
Houston, 
Texas, 
Trussville, Alabama, and Arvada, Colorado: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes Girl Scouts of the United 
States of America for 109 years of inspiring 
girl leadership, including civic and commu-
nity engagement; 
(2) congratulates all Girl Scouts who 
earned the Gold Award in 2020, including the 
National Gold Award Girl Scouts; and 
(3) encourages Girl Scouts of the United 
States of America to continue to nurture 
and support the leadership development of 
girls, including their ambitions, talents, and 
skills as future women leaders.

107—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE RELATING TO THE 10TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH 
11, 2011, EARTHQUAKE AND TSU-
NAMI IN JAPAN 
Mr. HAGERTY (for himself and Mr. 
COONS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 107 
Whereas, at 2:46 p.m. on March 11, 2011, an 
earthquake initially reported as measuring 
8.9 on the Richter scale, the strongest re-
corded in more than 100 years in Japan, oc-
curred near the Tohoku region of Northeast 
Japan, 81 miles off the coast from Sendai 
City; 
Whereas intense shaking could be felt from 
Tokyo to Kamaishi, an arc of roughly 360 
miles; 
Whereas the earthquake generated a mas-
sive tsunami that caused widespread damage 
to a swath of the northeast Japanese coast-
line and traveled across the Pacific Ocean, 
causing damage to coastal communities as 
far away as the States of Hawaii, Oregon, 
and California; 
Whereas authorities in Japan confirm at 
least 15,899 deaths from the earthquake and 
resulting tsunami; 
Whereas, within minutes of the earth-
quake, the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration alerted emergency 
workers in the States of Hawaii, California, 
Oregon, Washington, and Alaska that a po-
tentially catastrophic tsunami was heading 
toward those States and mobilized the Tsu-
nami Warning System in the Pacific; 
Whereas the earthquake forced the emer-
gency shutdown of 4 nuclear power facilities 
in Japan, representing a significant loss of 
electric generation capacity for Japan and 
necessitating rolling blackouts in portions of 
Tokyo; 
Whereas the earthquake and the resulting 
tsunami severely damaged the Fukushima 
Daiichi nuclear power station, precipitating 
a loss of power for cooling systems at that 
facility and necessitating emergency meas-
ures to prevent serious radiation leakages;

aster was swift, with search and rescue 
teams arriving from the United States, the 
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, 
France, and China, among other countries; 
Whereas the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft 
carrier and its support vessels were deployed 
to the earthquake region to participate in

Whereas elements of the III Marine Expedi-
tionary Force (MEF), a United States Agen-
cy for International Development Disaster 
Assistance Response Team (DART), and 
other United States military and civilian

efforts; 
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance 
is based upon shared values, democratic 
ideals, free markets, and a mutual respect 
for human rights, individual liberties, and 
the rule of law, and is central to the security 
and prosperity of the entire Indo-Pacific re-
gion; 
Whereas the Self-Defense Forces of Japan 
have contributed broadly to global security 
missions, including relief operations fol-
lowing the tsunami in Indonesia in 2005, re-
construction in Iraq from 2004 to 2006, and re-
lief assistance following the earthquake in 
Haiti in 2010; 
Whereas Japan is among the most gen-
erous donor nations, providing billions of 
dollars of foreign assistance, including dis-
aster relief, annually to developing coun-
tries; 
Whereas, since 2011, Japan has committed 
tremendous resources and effort to decom-
mission the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power station by taking measures on con-
taminated water and extracting fuel; 
Whereas, since 2011, Japan has committed 
tremendous resources and effort to restore 
the environment in Fukushima Prefecture, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency, to ensure that citi-
zens can live with peace of mind with safe 
water and food; and 
Whereas, 10 years after the earthquake and 
resulting tsunami, Japan is seeking to host a 
successful Olympics in Tokyo where the best 
athletes from across the world can showcase 
their talents amidst the ongoing global 
COVID–19 pandemic: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) mourns the loss of life resulting from

vivors who are still suffering in the after-
math of the natural disaster; 
(4) commends the Government of Japan for 
its courageous and professional response to 
the natural disaster; and

SCHOOL TESTING IN DISTRICT 
HON. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, the 
American Rescue Plan is going to help get 
kids back to full, in-person learning in the 
Massachusetts Fourth. Since even before tak-
ing office, opening the schools has been my 
top district priority. 
With the Rescue Plan, we are not only 
boosting the production of vaccines that pro-
tect teachers and staff, we are also providing 
money for HVAC upgrades and for ongoing 
COVID surveillance testing in the schools. 
This testing catches outbreaks early and 
breaks transmission chains. It provides con-
fidence and transparency as we reopen. I’m 
proud that scientists & operators in my district 
are developing these cutting-edge, low-cost 
school-testing technologies, including at Gink-
go Bioworks, CIC Health and Project Beacon. 
Classrooms must be open, and they must be 
safe for students and teachers alike. With vac-
cines and testing, they will be.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHELSEA 
KERR VENESKEY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Chelsea Kerr 
Veneskey on receiving the Blair County 
Chamber of Commerce’s Young Professional 
of the Year Award, which recognizes a leader 
who is making Blair County a better place for 
young people to live and do business. 
Chelsea consistently is involved in commu-
nity service projects and regularly mentors 
other young professionals as they develop 
professional strengths. She also promotes par-
ticipation in our region’s civic and business or-
ganizations, and she serves on numerous 
boards. Chelsea is immensely dedicated to 
our community’s growth. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate Chelsea on this 
accomplishment and thank her for her service 
to the Blair County community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
FREDERICK WALTON ALLEN 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Frederick Walton 
Allen of Peoria, Illinois, who passed away on 
January 24, 2021, at the age of 97. 
Fred Allen, born on June 10, 1923, in 
Ripon, Wisconsin, had a long and distin-
guished career as a plaintiff’s attorney. A self- 
made businessman, Fred built his law firm in 
Peoria around respect and integrity, virtues 
admired by both his clients and community. 
These priorities helped him become the first 
downstate Illinois lawyer to win a $1 million 
award for a client and become a member of 
the Inner Circle of Advocates, an elite national 
group limited to plaintiff’s attorneys who had 
won seven-figure awards. 
Fred lived a full life and his accomplish-
ments were not limited to his legal career. As 
a young man, his studies were halted early 
due to the start of WWII. Mr. Allen enlisted on 
December 7, 1942, exactly one year after the 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and became 
a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces. After his 
military service, he signed a contract as a 
pitcher with a minor league affiliate for the 
Cleveland Indians. In 1949 when Fred grad-
uated from Law School at Northwestern Uni-
versity, he immediately took the ‘‘rocket train’’ 
to Peoria where he applied for his first job at 
a firm. He continually served others through 
countless years of membership at the Elks 
Club, the American Legion, the Country Club 
of Peoria, and the First United Methodist 
Church of Peoria. He loved central Illinois and 
made many quiet contributions to better the 
lives of those in his community. 
Fred will also be remembered for his love 
and commitment to his wonderful family. He 
was preceded in death by his wife Tilley, who 
said Fred’s love and devotion to her through-
out their 66 years of marriage were beyond 
measure. He was blessed with three daugh-
ters, Diane, Rita, and Laura, 7 grandchildren, 
and 14 great-grandchildren. Fred’s fondest 
memories in life were ones spent with his fam-
ily and his love and pride for them were 
boundless. 
I want to offer my condolences to the Allen 
family and the people of Peoria on the loss of 
a great man. Fred left a lasting impact on 
those who had the pleasure of knowing him. 
May his memory be eternal.

RECOGNIZING 
MARGARITA 
‘‘MARGIE’’ NELSON IN HONOR OF 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of Women’s History Month, I rise today 
to recognize Margarita ‘‘Margie’’ Nelson, 
whose dedication towards bettering Southern 
Florida and giving back to her community has 
had a significant impact on Florida’s 25th Con-
gressional district. 
Born in East Chicago, Indiana in 1958, 
Margie moved to Naples, Florida in the 1970s. 
It is here where she met her husband, Kevin, 
and together they have three children, Teresa, 
Sheri, and Billy. Margie began her long career 
with the Collier County Sheriff’s office in 1970, 
where she worked for the Department of In-
vestigations. While working and raising her 
family, Margie received her bachelor’s degree 
in Business Administration from Hodges Uni-
versity. She continued her career with the Col-
lier Sheriff’s office until her retirement in 2014. 
Unable to stay away from serving her com-
munity, Margie returned to school and re-
ceived her teaching certificate. Then, in 2016, 
she rejoined the workforce as an Exceptional 
Student Education (ESE) teacher for the 
Hendry County public school system. Pres-
ently, Margie is the guidance counselor at 
LaBelle Middle School, where she uses her 
wisdom and experience to assist and support 
her students. Her commitment towards helping 
her students cannot be matched, and, if 
Margie wasn’t busy enough, she is currently in 
the process of receiving her master’s degree 
for school guidance counseling. 
Her passion for serving others is not limited 
to working with students, she is also an active 
volunteer in several organizations within her 
community. She is an integral member of a 
sewing group at the First Baptist Church of 
LaBelle, where she creates activity bags for 
her local children’s hospital and participates in 
projects to help an orphanage in Guatemala. 
Additionally, she volunteers to acquire and as-
semble boxes for Operation Christmas Child, 
which provides gifts to needy children world-
wide during Christmastime. 
Madam Speaker, as a lifelong public serv-
ant, Margie’s commitment to giving back 
knows no bounds, and it is truly a privilege to 
know and work with her. Her determination to 
help others has never wavered, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing this out-
standing individual.

COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, at a time 
when all families are struggling with the threat 
of COVID–19, various communities are also 
suffering from the rise in hate crimes. In the 
last year, nearly 3,000 firsthand accounts of 
physical, verbal, and online attacks against 
those of Asian descent were reported. Asian 
Americans are fighting not just the COVID–19 
pandemic, but an additional pandemic of hate 
and bigotry. 
One third of Americans have witnessed 
someone blaming Asian Americans for the 
coronavirus. Eight out of ten AAPI youth report 
being bullied or verbally harassed due to their 
race. Elderly Asian Americans are being as-
saulted—tragically resulting in even death. On-
line hate speech and cyberbullying against 
Asians has increased by 900 percent during 
the pandemic. This is horrific—and it goes 
against the moral fabric of our nation. We

must address these ongoing hate crimes and 
incidents with urgency. 
That is why I reintroduced the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act. My bill would designate a 
point person at the Department of Justice to 
expedite the review of hate crimes related to 
COVID–19, specifically crimes of violence mo-
tivated by the actual or perceived relationship 
to the spread of COVID–19. My bill also in-
cludes initiatives to establish online reporting 
of hate crimes or incidents in multiple lan-
guages and to expand public education cam-
paigns to encourage and empower ethnic 
communities to feel comfortable and report 
these incidents. 
My bill also directs the Attorney General to 
work with Health and Human Services, the 
COVID–19 Healthy Equity Task Force, and 
community-based organizations to issue best 
practices to mitigate racially discriminatory lan-
guage in describing the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, during this time of height-
ened anxiety and fear surrounding COVID–19, 
we cannot lose sight of protecting the health 
and safety of every single person—no matter 
their race, ethnicity, age, or background. The 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act is a necessary 
step to confront the second pandemic of rac-
ism and discrimination in this country. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in this effort to keep 
all Americans safe.

IN RECOGNITION OF DEBBIE 
ECKENRODE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Debbie Eckenrode on 
receiving the Blair County Chamber of Com-
merce’s Joseph P. Rosenhamer Chamber 
Spirit Award, which recognizes a longtime 
Chamber member who embodies the traits we 
hope to see in business leaders. 
Debbie has been an outstanding member of 
the Blair County Chamber of Commerce and 
frequently leads efforts to support the cham-
ber’s community events. Additionally, she 
mentors new chamber members and entre-
preneurs in the region. Debbie is a dedicated 
member and ensures that the organization 
maintains its robust presence in the commu-
nity. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate Debbie on this 
accomplishment and thank her for her service 
to the Blair County community.

HONORING GABRIELLA GONZALEZ 
AND MORGAN HARVEY UPON RE-
CEIVING THE NATIONAL MEDAL 
OF HONOR LIFESAVING AWARD 
FROM THE GIRLS SCOUTS OF 
THE USA 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize two young women from 
Virginia Beach, Gabriella Gonzalez and Mor-
gan Harvey, who were awarded the National 
Medal of Honor Lifesaving Award from the 
Girls Scouts of the USA. 
After practice on a hot summer day in Au-
gust 2019, Morgan and Gabriella’s rowing club 
team decided to take turns jumping from a 
rope swing into Virginia Beach’s Lake Joyce. 
The summer fun took a turn for the worse 
when their coach, Dr. Mark Winters, severely 
fractured his ankle on the bottom of the lake. 
Gabriella and Morgan both sprang into action 
to assist Dr. Winters. Gabriella swam along 
with other crew members to help her coach, 
holding his body above water and comforting 
him as he went into shock. Morgan rowed 
back to shore, helped guide rescue crews to 
the location, and organized team members to 
provide additional support. With their help, Dr. 
Winters was able to receive prompt medical 
attention, likely saving his life. 
Both Gabriella and Morgan credit their expe-
rience as girl scouts in preparing them for the 
intense situation. With the poise and bravery 
that they displayed in such a critical moment, 
Morgan and Gabriella are more than worthy of 
the National Medal of Honor Lifesaving Award. 
It is important that we recognize individuals 
in our communities who go above and beyond 
to make a difference. I am proud to represent 
these two young heroes in Congress, and I 
congratulate Gabriella and Morgan on receiv-
ing this well-deserved honor.

TO 
THE 
DEPART-

HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and thank Mr. Doug 
Bush for his years of service to the United 
States Congress and congratulate him on his 
appointment to serve as the Principal Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisi-
tion, Logistics, and Technology. 
A graduate of the United States Military 
Academy at West Point, former Army officer, 
and long-serving congressional staffer, Doug 
has served our country in uniform and as a ci-
vilian for nearly 30 years. Though he started 
his congressional career as a Senate staffer, 
something we try not to hold against him, 
Doug has spent the last 14 years as a valu-
able member of the House Armed Services 
Committee’s professional staff. 
From 2007 to 2019, Doug supported the 
Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee’s 
oversight of aviation and ground-based weap-
on systems, equipment, and programs. Doug’s 
work with committee members helped the 
committee accelerate the development and 
fielding of weapon systems and equipment 
that enhanced the capabilities of our Armed 
Forces and terminate under-performing pro-
grams. More recently, Doug served as the 
Deputy Staff Director of the Armed Services 
Committee from 2019 to 2021 where he man-
aged the day-to-day operations of the com-
mittee and the development of the annual Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As 
the Congress grappled with how to safely con-
tinue operations during the COVID–19 pan-
demic this past year, Doug played a critical 
role to ensure the Armed Services Committee 
continued to conduct effective oversight while 
also enacting the 60th consecutive NDAA. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the House 
Armed Services Committee, I extend our 
deepest appreciation to Doug for his dedicated 
service to the committee, the Congress, and 
the military and civilian personnel of the 
Armed Forces. We wish him well as he con-
tinues his public service at the Pentagon with 
the Department of the Army.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

Dairy Queen franchise owner, on receiving the 
Blair County Chamber of Commerce’s Small 
Business Person of the Year Award. This 
honor recognizes individuals who have re-
sponded well to adversity while serving the 
Blair County community. 
Though businesses in the hospitality and 
restaurant industry faced extraordinary chal-
lenges due to COVID–19, Matthew remained 
committed to growing his business and to pro-
tect his employees’ livelihoods. He persevered 
through challenges and adapted to serve Blair 
County residents efficiently and safely under 
the COVID restrictions, saving jobs in our 
community. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate Matthew on win-
ning this accomplishment and thank him for 
his service to the Blair County community.

child care and the urgent need to address the 
childcare cliff effect to create better oppor-
tunity for families. At the Wilkie House you can 
see his determination and dedication not only 
in tackling big projects like significant infra-
structure improvements to the building and 
playground, but also in little things like walking 
kids to their parent’s car at the end of the 
evening to say goodnight. 
Like many small non-profit leaders, John 
dedicates an immense amount of time and ef-
fort, wears many hats, and maximizes limited 
resources to make his programs successful. 
During workdays that regularly last nearly 12 
hours, John works on grants, community out-
reach and engagement, assisting families in 
overcoming barriers, and accessing resources 
and administration. He’s constantly working on 
growing funding to keep up with the increase 
in numbers so the Wilkie House can serve 
more children. With all that and more on his 
plate, he still spends time with the kids during 
afterschool activities and cites it a source of 
great joy. 
Established in September of 1917, the 
Wilkie House initially served as an extension 
of the War Recreation Board for Black Officers 
at Fort Des Moines, making it one of the old-
est African-American community-based organi-
zations in the state of Iowa. Today the organi-
zation’s rich history is carried forward through 
the mission of developing character and es-
teem in young people through promotion of 
academics, building social skills, health, and 
recreation. The nonprofit serves nearly 400 
youth ages 5–18 years and their families dur-
ing the fiscal year, with the majority of partici-
pants coming from low-income families and di-
verse ethnic backgrounds. 
The ongoing COVID–19 pandemic has pre-
sented significant challenges to John and his 
team. The Wilkie House was one of the first 
organizations 
to 
reopen and stay open 
throughout the summer and for virtual learning 
support in the school year. They adapted to 
facilitate safe, full-day school year program-
ming during virtual learning days so youth par-
ticipants could better understand and complete 
their academics, receive tutoring and daily 
meals, and fulfill critical social needs through 
recreational and social skill building activities. 
It would be impossible to measure the kind of 
positive impact this program has had on our 
community during such a difficult time. 
Despite the additional challenges, John and 
the Wilkie House team have continued to pro-
vide after school programming so kids can 
have snacks and dinner, engage in active and 
creative activities, and receive tutoring and 
homework assistance. They maintain summer 
programming with trips to the park and the 
zoo, volunteer opportunities, and work with 
youth on growth areas like problem solving, 
coping with change, independence, compas-
sion, and career readiness. John also helps 
the Wilkie House maintain its position as a 
community hub by hosting evening and week-
end events that bring people together for 
meals, fun activities, sporting events, and 
even musical performances from groups like 
the Isiserettes Drill and Drum Corp. 
Before stepping up to his current role, John 
worked as a coordinator of a federal grant at 
the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Fami-
lies. He spent time in higher education and 
worked internationally in non-profits to help 
families living in extreme poverty, including 
those in slums, orphanages, and children liv-
ing on the street. Giving back to those in 
need, particularly young children, has been 
the highlight of his career. 
Individuals like John Douglas who prioritize 
service over self in order to create a better life 
for individuals and better community for all 
their neighbors, especially those who are un-
derserved and underrepresented, are com-
mendable for so many reasons. Not only has 
he had an immediate and positive effect on 
the kids and families he serves through the 
Wilkie House, but the whole of Des Moines is 
better off because of his ongoing efforts. I’m 
proud to count John as a neighbor and thank 
him for his dedication. It is my honor to name 
him our Iowan of the Week.

erans, amidst her own personal tragedy, has 
had a significant impact on our country and 
South Florida. 
Born in Massachusetts on August 25, 1932, 
Georgie and her three children moved to Flor-
ida in the 1960s, and they quickly found them-
selves living in Hialeah. Georgie’s only son, 
Bruce Wayne Carter, enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps in 1968 to defend his na-
tion during the Vietnam War. Private First 
Class Carter served in Company H, 2nd Bat-
talion, 3rd Marines, and was killed in action on 
August 7, 1969 in the Quang Tri Province. At 
the young age of nineteen, PFC Carter put the 
lives of his fellow soldiers ahead of his own, 
and, when ambushed, used his own body to 
shield his men from an enemy grenade. He 
was buried with Military Funeral Honors on 
August 25, 1969 at the Vista Memorial Gar-
dens in Miami Lakes, Florida. 
PFC Carter’s heroic act quickly reached the 
White House, where, in 1971, Bruce was post-
humously awarded our nation’s highest rec-
ognition, the Medal of Honor. In the years that 
followed Bruce’s death, Georgie truly turned 
her grief into action and became an advocate 
for our veterans. Initially, she volunteered with 
her neighbor at the Miami VA hospital and as-
sisted those who had strokes or other injuries 
which prevented them from feeding them-
selves. They quickly became known as the 
Silver Spoons and traveled throughout the na-
tion to VA hospitals promoting this program. 
Georgie became an integral member of the 
American Gold Star Mothers, where she 
served as the National President twice, in 
2001 and 2008. With the help of former Con-
gresswoman, and my good friend, Ileana Ros- 
Lehtinen, the Miami VA Hospital was renamed 
the Bruce W. Carter VA Medical Center in 
2008. 
While Georgie became a steadfast voice for 
those who needed her most, she continued to 
regret that her son was buried in Florida and 
not at Arlington National Cemetery. As a re-
sult, Georgie worked with my team and me to 
have Bruce’s remains transferred to Arlington, 
and, on November 4, 2020, PFC Carter was 
laid to rest with Military Funeral Honors at Ar-
lington National Cemetery. This act served as 
an important reminder to all that a soldier’s life 
is always valued, no matter how much time 
has passed. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to know 
Mrs. Carter-Krell and I commend her for her 
dedication to preserving her son’s memory 
and her unwavering support for our veterans. 
Georgie is a true patriot and I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing this out-
standing individual.

ADVANCING 
AMERICA’S 
DIPLO-
MATIC 
RELATIONS 
WITH 
THE 
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to promote the strategic partnership between 
the United States and the Arab Republic of 
Egypt. I find it of the utmost importance to ad-
vance diplomatic relations with a nation that 
has proven many times to be a dedicated 
friend to the United States and our allies. 
It’s no secret that the Middle East is a com-
plicated region with divisions deeply rooted in 
ancient conflict dating back thousands of 
years. Egypt has been a proven partner to the 
U.S. foreign policy goals in the region, with the 
hopes to end these conflicts and bring peace 
to a region that so desperately craves it. With-
out Egypt’s partnership, the fight against ter-
rorism and the strive for curbing proliferation 
would not be possible. I’ve always said that 
trust is a series of promises kept. The Arab 
Republic of Egypt has proven time and time 
again that they can be a trusted ally and friend 
to the people of the United States. 
Egypt has been, and will continue to be, a 
beacon of hope for all nations across the Mid-
dle East and North Africa and a leader for 
prosperity, culture, and education for other na-
tions to follow. Using this foundation to ad-
vance interfaith tolerance and freedoms, I 
have long been inspired by the Egyptian peo-
ple, their freedoms, and their diligence to 
make the region and world a better place for 
their children. I am of the belief that the Egyp-
tian government and the Egyptian people have 
played a vital role in the success of American 
foreign policy in the region over the recent 
decades. 
Under the leadership of President Trump, 
the U.S. and Egypt became even closer allies 
in the fight against terrorism. I hope that the 
Biden administration will support the Egyptians 
as much as President Trump did during his 
time in office. 
Regional peace is a goal of not only myself, 
but the people of the United States, Egypt, 
and many other nations across the globe. 
Therefore, it’s critical that we recognize the 
sacrifices and efforts that Egypt has played in 
the regional peace agreements that have sur-
faced under recent years. Ever since the 1979 
peace treaty with Israel, Egypt, and the United 
States, both nations have proven to be effec-
tive regional partners. 
Madam Speaker, I’m thankful for the close 
friendship that the U.S. shares with Egypt. I 
hope that we can continue to advance this 
great relationship with our friends in the Mid-
dle East. I urge all my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the strategic partnership be-
tween our nations and to continue to advance 
our shared goals going forward.

IN RECOGNITION OF VIRGINIA 
HELSEL 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Virginia Helsel on re-
ceiving the Blair County Chamber of Com-
merce’s George Award, which recognizes an 
individual’s volunteer efforts that have im-
proved life in Blair County. A nurse by trade, 
Virginia started God’s Little Offerings in her 
garage to help Blair County families in need. 
Though the organization originally provided 
only holiday meals, it has expanded to assist 
with other necessities. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate Virginia on this 
accomplishment and thank her for her service 
to the Blair County community.

SECRETARY 
OF

HON. ADAM SMITH

Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and thank Ms. Leonor 
Tomero for her years of service to the United 
States Congress and congratulate her on her 
appointment to serve as the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile 
Defense Policy in the Office of the Secretary 
of Defense. 
Leonor has committed her professional ca-
reer to advancing dialogue on nuclear non- 
proliferation and arms control within the non- 
profit world, amongst our international allies 
and partners, and most notably, with the De-
partments of State and Defense. She has 
been a strong advocate for taking a common- 
sense approach to rethinking our reliance on 
nuclear weapons—one of the only true exis-
tential threats to humankind today. Though 
she started her congressional career as a 
Senate staffer, something we try not to hold 
against her, Leonor has spent the last 10 
years as a valuable member of the House 
Armed 
Services 
Committee’s 
professional 
staff. 
From 2010 to 2021, Leonor supported the 
Strategic Forces Subcommittee’s oversight of 
national security space, nuclear weapons, nu-
clear non-proliferation, nuclear clean-up, and 
missile defense issues. Leonor’s work with 
committee members helped the committee 
conduct proper oversight of both programmatic 
and policy aspects of strategic deterrence and 
increased understanding regarding the deli-
cate balance of strategic stability. Leonor’s 
commitment to advancing space from a na-
tional security standpoint culminated in the es-
tablishment of the Space Force, which despite 
the previous administration’s boasting, was 
truly a bi-partisan effort that emanated from 
the HASC Strategic Forces subcommittee. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the House 
Armed Services Committee, I extend our 
deepest appreciation to Leonor for her dedi-
cated service to the committee, the Congress, 
and the military and civilian personnel of the 
Armed Forces. We wish her well as she con-
tinues her public service at the Pentagon with 
the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy.

CELEBRATING ELISA DE LA VARA 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the faithful service and 
hard work of Elisa de la Vara, who will retire 
this month after nearly fifty years of service to 
the people of Arizona. Born and raised in the 
small border community of Somerton, Arizona, 
Elisa has dedicated her life to following her fa-
ther’s example by giving back to her commu-
nity. 
Elisa most recently served as Chief Com-
munity Officer for the Arizona Community 
Foundation. In this role, she oversaw the in-
vestment of nearly half a billion dollars in grant 
funding to community organizations across Ar-
izona and brought diverse voices and per-
spectives together through her work with the 
Latinos Unidos Initiative, the Black Philan-
thropy Initiative, the Asian Pacific American 
Women’s Giving Circle, and the Native Amer-
ican Initiative. She also led the Foundation’s 
affordable housing initiative and rural philan-
thropy work, where she developed innovative 
solutions to make sure more Arizona families 
had access to housing. 
Elisa has also served in many other roles 
including as District Director for my distin-
guished predecessor, Congressman Ed Pas-
tor, Special Assistant to Arizona Governor 
Bruce Babbitt, Executive Vice President for 
Chicanos Por La Causa, and Assistant to the 
President of the League of United Latin Amer-
ican Citizens. Elisa’s work often focused on 
housing. She opened and led Fannie Mae’s 
Arizona Office and she developed and hosted 
Arizona’s first Spanish language real estate 
television 
show 
on 
Univision 
entitled 
Bienvenido a Mi Casa, which was devoted to 
informing and educating viewers on the rights 
and responsibilities of home ownership, includ-
ing the mortgage process. 
Throughout her distinguished career, Elisa 
rightfully earned many awards and recogni-
tions. I would like to share my deep apprecia-
tion to Elisa for her years of service to our 
Congressional District, to our community, and 
to all of Arizona, and I wish her all the best in 
her retirement.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

on receiving the Blair County Chamber of 
Commerce’s Judith A. Rossi Educator of the 
Year Award, which recognizes educators who 
have influenced educational systems in a 
manner that benefits Blair County’s economy. 
As a 2nd grade teacher at Baker Elemen-
tary School in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Lindsay 
has overcome great educational challenges 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. In her career, 
Lindsay has taught students at several grade 
levels and has been recognized as a dedi-
cated and innovative teacher. In her spare 
time, Lindsay also volunteers as an ESL 
teacher for Blair County families that do not 
speak English.

THE 
WHITE 
HOUSE COUNSEL’S OFFICE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and thank Ms. Jamie 
Jackson for her service to the United States 
Congress and congratulate her on her ap-
pointment to serve as a Senior Deputy Asso-
ciate Counsel at the White House. 
A two-time graduate of the University of Vir-
ginia and with a law degree from the Univer-
sity of Maryland School of Law, Jamie’s career 
has spanned a decade of public service. After 
working in various positions in the Legislative 
and Executive Branches of government, Jamie 
joined the House Armed Services Committee’s 
professional staff in 2018, where she served 
as the minority staff lead for the Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigation. She also ad-
vised Members of the full committee and the 
Subcommittee on Military Personnel on policy 
matters related to information technology, cy-
bersecurity, and military justice. 
More recently, Jamie served as the commit-
tee’s Deputy General Counsel from 2019 to 
2021, where she played a critical role in the 
development and passage of two National De-
fense Authorization Acts (NDAA). Through her 
work with Members, outside committees, the 
Office of Legislative Counsel, and the Office of 
the Parliamentarian, Jamie played a central 
role in advising Members and staff of the com-
mittee on legal and procedural matters related 
to the bill. I can say with certainty that the 
committee would not have been able to get 
the 59th and 60th consecutive NDAAs done 
without the tireless work and support of Jamie 
Jackson. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the House 
Armed Services Committee, I extend our 
deepest appreciation to Jamie for her dedi-
cated service to the committee, the Congress, 
and the military and civilian personnel of the 
Armed Forces. We wish her well as she con-

ENERGIZING AMERICAN 
SHIPBUILDING ACT OF 2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘Energizing American Ship-
building Act’’, which I have sponsored since 
2016 as part of my ‘‘Make it in America’’ agen-
da. I thank my bipartisan original cosponsors 
for their support, as well as U.S. Senators 
ROGER F. WICKER (R–MS) and ROBERT P. 
CASEY, Jr. (D–PA) for sponsoring the com-
panion bill. 
Our bipartisan legislation seeks to recapi-
talize 
America’s 
strategic 
domestic 
ship-
building and maritime industries by requiring 
that increasing percentages of liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) and crude oil exports be trans-
ported on U.S.-built, flagged, and crewed ves-
sels. In total, our bill would require that 15 per-
cent of total seaborne LNG exports be ex-
ported on vessels built in the United States by 
2043 and 10 percent of total seaborne crude 
oil exports by 2035. 
In total, the ‘‘Energizing American Ship-
building Act’’ is projected to result in the con-
struction of more than 40 American ships: ap-
proximately 28 LNG carriers by 2043 and 12 
oil tankers by 2035. This work will support 
thousands of new well-paying jobs in Amer-
ican shipyards, as well as the domestic vessel 
component manufacturing and maritime indus-
tries. 
Unless Congress acts, all U.S. seaborne 
LNG and crude oil exports will be on foreign- 
flagged vessels, operated by foreign crews. 
American shipyards and mariners are ready 
for the job, and our bill ensures they are no 
longer expected to compete against heavily 
subsidized foreign shipyards in Korea, China, 
and elsewhere. 
There is strong precedent for this policy. In 
1995, Congress enacted the Alaska Power 
Administration Asset Sale and Termination Act 
(Public Law 104–58). This federal law allowed 
the export of crude oil from Alaska’s North 
Slope but required that those exports be trans-
ported on U.S.-flagged vessels to preserve the 
tanker fleet essential to our national defense. 
It was good policy then, and it is good policy 
now. 
The ‘‘Energizing American Shipbuilding Act’’ 
would implement a similar requirement that 
fixed percentages of seaborne U.S. LNG and 
crude oil exports be on U.S.-built, flagged, and 
crewed vessels. These same vessels, once 
built under our bill, would be available to meet 
the U.S. military’s sealift and supply needs 
around the globe. 
Like many members of Congress, I am 
deeply troubled that our military, namely the 
Defense Logistics Agency, relies on foreign- 
owned oil tankers, including state-owned en-
terprises closely linked to the Chinese govern-
ment. Our bipartisan bill also counters other 
export countries’ similar requirements, includ-
ing the Russian-flagged vessel requirement for 
arctic oil and natural gas exports announced 
by the Kremlin in December 2018. 
The United States projected to become a 
net crude oil exporter and the top LNG export-
ing nation in the coming years. Exports of 
these two strategic national assets—LNG and 
crude oil—should be on American vessels, 
which is exactly what our bill would require. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of the 
House to join us in cosponsoring the ‘‘Ener-
gizing American Shipbuilding Act.’’ Lastly, I 
want to thank my former Chief of Staff, Ms. 
Emily Burns, for her instrumental role in devel-
oping this legislation during the 114th and 
115th Congresses while on my staff.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BOB 
EGOLF 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Mr. Bob Egolf of 
Churubusco, Indiana. 
For 65 years, Egolf worked in the grocery 
business. He started his career at John 
Shelton’s IGA, located on North Main Street in 
Churubusco in 1956 when he was 14 years 
old. Seven years later, he purchased the gro-
cery from Shelton in 1967, and in 1982 built 
a new store south of Churubusco on US 33. 
Egolf’s IGA is known throughout the area for 
its freshly cut meats and daily baked bakery 
items. Egolf opened the store early and closed 
late, operating from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven 
days a week. He made it a point to talk with 
his customers and would take special orders 
of items that people wanted. 
Egolf was one of the longest continuous 
business owners in Churubusco’s history. In 
addition to running his business, he frequently 
gave his time and money to local causes. But 
for Egolf’s partnership with the Churubusco 
News, the newspaper would not exist today. 
He also contributed to the community through 
various organizations, such as with the 
Churubusco 
Area 
Jaycees, 
Churubusco 
Chamber of Commerce and as a longtime 
Smith Township trustee. 
The story of Mr. Egolf is one that is uniquely 
American: defined by hard work, sacrifice, and 
service to others. Though Bob is no longer 
with us, his spirit of good will and generosity 
to those in Churubusco and beyond endures.

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE 
GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR EDU-
CATION 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
express my support for the Global Partnership 
for Education, the largest global fund solely 
dedicated to transforming education in lower- 
income countries. 
Access to quality education reduces pov-
erty, advances economic prosperity, improves 
peace and security, and strengthens public 
health. As we now know too well, COVID–19 
has compounded the barriers that keep kids 
from being educated both here at home and 
around the world. 
International basic education programs, in-
cluding GPE, increase equitable access to 
education, providing children with foundational 
reading, math, social, and emotional skills. 
Access to education is severely impacted by 
emergencies. 1 in 3 children and young peo-
ple are out of school in countries affected by 
conflict or disaster, and half of school-age ref-
ugee children are out of school. And, of 
course, 1.6 billion children in more than 190 
countries were impacted by the closure of 
educational institutions at the peak of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. GPE works in the coun-
tries with the greatest need, targets the hard-
est to reach children, and can respond quickly 
to emergencies. 
I thank my colleagues, Representatives 
BRIAN FITZPATRICK and MIKE QUIGLEY, who 
have joined me to introduce this important res-
olution. I urge all of my colleagues to cospon-
sor this resolution, which affirms the leader-
ship and commitment of the U.S. to improving 
access to quality, inclusive public education; 
calls for multi-year pledges from the U.S. to 
allow GPE to maximize its impact in sup-
porting governments to provide this education; 
and calls on the State Department and USAID 
to promote children and youth attending 
schools around the world. 
Madam Speaker, we know the value and 
impact quality education can make on one’s 
dignity, wellbeing, and livelihood. This resolu-
tion affirms that every child deserves to reach 
their fullest potential.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROYANNE

HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a great Republican leader 
and public servant, Royanne Ortiz. As a resi-
dent of Bullhead City for 10 years, Royanne 
graciously and selflessly used her leadership 
skills to benefit Arizonans. Her bold leadership 
was reflected in her role as District Director for 
Mohave County Republican Central Com-
mittee since 2017 and through the many suc-
cessful Lincoln Day Dinners she oversaw in 
District 2. 
Royanne was also well known for her fear-
less 
approach 
towards 
education 
policy 
issues. Her tenacity and passion for education 
reform even led her to running for the 2020 
Mohave Community College Board. Her com-
mitment to civic duty and her community was 
regularly reflected through her participation in 
meetings hosted by the Bullhead City Council, 
Colorado River Republican Women Club, and 
Colorado River Union High School District. I 
believe Royanne Ortiz is a great example of a 
Republican woman and her impact and in-
volvement will not be forgotten by her commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, I express my deepest con-
dolences to the family of Royanne Ortiz on her 
passing, and I encourage my colleagues to 
join me in celebrating her life and legacy as a 
valuable civic servant to the people of Arizona.

RECOGNIZING DETECTIVE TONYA 
DAVIS IN HONOR OF WOMEN’S 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of Women’s History Month, I rise today 
to recognize Detective Tonya Davis, whose 
dedication towards protecting and serving her 
community has left an unforgettable mark on 
Southern Florida. 
Born in Kentucky, Tonya moved to the 
Naples area with her family at a young age, 
and still resides there today. Wanting to serve 
her community, in 1999 Tonya joined the Col-
lier County Sheriffs Office as a 9–1–1 dis-
patcher. For four years, she worked in the 
communications division and then became 
certified as a law enforcement officer, where, 
in 2003 she began serving as a road patrol 
deputy. In 2007, Tonya became a detective 
with the General Crimes Bureau and uses her 
expertise to support victims and investigate 
crimes such as arson, fraud, larceny, and bur-
glary. 
Detective Davis has a continued passion to 
learn and better herself. In 2009, she received 
her associate degree, magna cum laude, in 
criminal justice technology from Edison State 
College. In 2011, she remained at Edison 
State College and obtained her bachelor’s de-
gree, summa cum laude, in public safety ad-
ministration. Still eager to learn, Tonya grad-
uated summa cum laude from Barry University 
with her master’s in administration. 
Those that know her best describe Detec-
tive Davis as selfless, dedicated, and com-
mitted to serving her community. Throughout 
her career, Tonya has received numerous ac-
colades, and has proven to be an officer that 
her community can trust and depend on. She 
is determined to make schools in Collier 
County a safer place for students, an initiative 
which I have also fought for throughout my 
time 
in 
Congress. 
Detective 
Davis 
has 
touched the lives of thousands of students and 
continues to find ways to give back to Collier 
County. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot speak more high-
ly of Detective Davis’s service to Southern 
Florida. She has proven time and again to be 
a reliable and trustworthy individual, and I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing this 
outstanding individual.

RECOGNIZING 
JESSE 
TOLLESON 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND 
HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COM-
MITTEE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and thank Mr. Jesse 
Tolleson for his years of service to the United 
States Congress and congratulate him on his 
transition to commercial industry. A graduate 
of James Madison University, Jesse has 
served our country for over 22 years begin-
ning as a Staff Assistant on the Armed Serv-
ices Committee and became one of the few 
people in our committee’s history to promote 
directly into a Professional Staff Member posi-
tion. 
Since 1999, Jesse has been responsible for 
evaluating and making recommendations for 
legislation, policy, and the authorization of ap-
propriations across the entire spectrum of 
issues within the jurisdiction of the Tactical Air 
and Land Forces Subcommittee. This is a sig-
nificant responsibility as the complexity and 
volume of aviation, maritime and ground- 
based weapon systems, equipment, and pro-
grams in the subcommittee’s jurisdiction in-
cludes hundreds of items valued in the tens of 
billions of dollars. Committee members have 
always recognized and depended upon Jes-
se’s intelligence, command of programmatic 
and policy details, and uncompromising insist-
ence on the objective facts from the defense 
agencies and industry. 
Over these years, Jesse’s recommendations 
have contributed to the readiness and mod-
ernization of our Armed Forces. It is no over-
statement to say that Jesse’s determination 
and commitment in the early years of the wars 
in the Middle East, especially his work in sup-
port of congressional acceleration of the de-
velopment and procurement of improved body 
armor and Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected 
(MRAP) vehicles, saved the lives of many 
service members who served in Iraq, Afghani-
stan, and elsewhere. The bipartisan and bi-
cameral success that the Armed Services 
Committee has enjoyed for the last 22 years 
is due in no small part to Jesse Tolleson’s 
professionalism, integrity, devotion to the com-
mittee’s traditions, and collegiality. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the House 
Armed Services Committee, we extend our 
deepest appreciation to Jesse for his dedi-
cated and selfless service to the committee, 
the Congress, and the military and civilian per-
sonnel of the Armed Forces. We wish him and 
his family all the best as they start this next 
chapter.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
HON. MADELEINE DEAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, yesterday, I 
was delighted to join my colleagues in voting 
in favor of the American Rescue Plan. 
This transformative legislation will provide: 
shots in arms; kids safely in schools; needed 
cash in pockets; support to our small busi-
nesses, including restaurants and catering that 
have been hit the hardest; $13 billion to my 
home state of Pennsylvania; and $161 million 
to Montgomery County and $81 million to 
Berks County—where my district resides. 
It should not be lost on us that we passed 
this relief in women’s history month. 
With over 2.3 million women forced to leave 
the workforce—including 1 million mothers— 
the time to invest and reinvigorate our econ-
omy for everyone is now. 
As the first female Secretary of the Treas-
ury, Janet Yellen, recently said, To avoid the 
long-term scarring of the economy later, the 
smartest thing we can do is to act big and so 
we did. 
We acted big boldly. Sending resources to 
the poor and working poor, we passed $1.9 
trillion for the people. Help is on the way.

SUPPORT OF ARIZONA STATE 
HOUSE BILL 2111 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of Arizona State House Bill 
2111, the ‘‘Second Amendment Firearm Free-
dom Act’’. This bill takes an originalist and 
strong stance on Arizonans’ right to bear 
arms. I am grateful for the work by all mem-
bers of the state legislature who introduced 
this legislation. I would especially like to thank 
State Representative Leo Biasucci for his sup-
port of the Second Amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E244 
March 11, 2021 
This legislation purports to allow the State of 
Arizona to protect the Second Amendment 
rights of its citizens, barring them from compli-
ance with any restrictions or infringements that 
the federal government enacts as federal law. 
Arizonans value sovereign state authority to 
the highest regard. Any infringements on their 
constitutionally protected rights are dangerous 
and federal overreach. I applaud Arizona HB 
2111 and its clear purpose of refusing to allow 
any federal overreach into the state and its 
citizens. 
The people of Arizona are strong supporters 
of the Second Amendment and the Constitu-
tion’s clear permission of allowing American 
citizens to keep and bear arms. As such, this 
legislation is a great movement for the citizens 
of the great state of Arizona. I look forward to 
the day that Governor Ducey signs this legis-
lation into official Arizona law. 
Madam Speaker, Arizona’s state motto is 
‘‘Ditat Deus,’’ meaning ‘‘God Enriches’’. I hold 
this phrase dear to my heart, and I know the 
citizens of Arizona do also. Through God’s en-
richment, I’m confident the governments at the 
local, state, and federal level will see any in-
fringements on constitutionally-protected rights 
as dangerous and un-American. 
I pray for the future of this nation every day. 
I believe that Americans have the right to keep 
and bear arms. This legislation is a great step 
forward for the people of Arizona and their 
rights that are protected under the Arizona 
Constitution and the Constitution of the United 
States.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF BILLY ALEXANDER 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of Billy 
Alexander, a dedicated public servant who 
worked tirelessly on behalf of childhood edu-
cation in West Contra Costa County and 
throughout California. 
Billy and his wife, Barbara, advocated for 
issues that affected children across our state. 
After Billy served in the Korean War as a 
member of the U.S. Army, Billy and Barbara 
returned to California and settled in Richmond 
to raise their family. Parents of eight children, 
the Alexanders took a direct role in the edu-
cation process by first joining the Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA). This led to them 
participating in junior high and high school 
PTAs and School Advisory Councils, where 
they established themselves as a collective 
force for good in our community. Billy and Bar-
bara would eventually become co-Chairs of 
the District Advisory Committee and spent 27 
years in that role. 
Billy and Barbara also displayed their knowl-
edge of and passion for childhood education 
on the state and national levels. They partici-
pated in developing the California Strategic 
Plan for Parental Involvement in Education, 
and Billy served on the California Committee 
of Practitioners, which helped develop Title I 
plans for the state. He was appointed to the 
California Department of Education’s Council 
of Black Affairs and to the Committee to Re-
vise Title 5. Additionally, in 1977, the Alexan-
ders won a California court case requiring 
school districts to ensure federal and state 
funds designated for Title I were actually used 
for that purpose. On a national level, Billy and 
Barbara served on the Board of Directors for 
the National Coalition of Title I/Chapter I Par-
ents and on the National Council on Educating 
Black Children. 
The Alexanders dedicated their lives to 
serving the needs of children in an effort to 
promote equitable educational opportunities. 
They touched the lives of countless families 
and created numerous programs benefiting 
the children and families of Richmond, includ-
ing Vision of Hope—a weekend tutoring pro-
gram that expanded to Summer of Hope, 
which operated as an alternative to summer 
school. They also created the Mother Hen/ 
Chanticleer Awards to honor individuals who 
exceptionally served West Contra Costa Uni-
fied School District students. From helping 
parents become better advocates for their chil-
dren to gifting books to students, the Alexan-
ders worked diligently to create better and 
more equal opportunities for disadvantaged 
youth. 
Billy and Barbara were married for 44 years 
until Barbara passed in 2001. Sadly, Billy 
passed away in November of 2020. Billy was 
a beloved resident of Richmond and a tremen-
dous advocate for children and he will be 
missed. Please join me in honoring him for his 
many contributions to our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF DEREK 
MARTIN 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 11, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Derek Martin on re-
ceiving the Blair County Chamber of Com-
merce’s Donna D. Gority Servant Leadership 
Award, which recognizes individuals who 
serve the Blair County community through 
their workplace. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic changed life 
across America, Derek led Altoona Curve staff 
members in assisting businesses and individ-
uals who were hardest hit in Blair County. He 
mentored others and offered support and en-
couragement to those who needed it most. 
Despite growing challenges, Derek continued 
his work to help our community weather this 
storm. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate Derek on this ac-
complishment and thank him for his service to 
the Blair County community.
