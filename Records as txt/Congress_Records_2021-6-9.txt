PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Gracious God, without You, our mor-
tal flesh is but disappearing dust. Draw 
close to our lawmakers, for, in Your 
presence, they can discover their dig-
nity and destiny. Make Your face shine 
with favor upon them today as they 
strive to do Your will. Lord, give them 
the wisdom to seek Your guidance, de-
pending upon Your redemptive power 
to direct their steps. Lift them into the 
saving knowledge that they are Your 
children, 
made 
in 
Your 
likeness. 
Strengthen them to plant seeds that 
will bring a harvest of peace and pu-
rity. 
We pray in Your righteous Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
U.S. COMPETITION AND INNOVATION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
68 to 32, that was the final vote tally 
last night for the U.S. Competition and 
Innovation 
Act—USICA—an 
over-
whelming display of bipartisan sup-
port, a rarity on a major bill in this 
Senate. 
I believe the final vote reflects the 
importance of the bill—of rededicating 
the Federal Government to science and 
technology; to outcompeting our ad-
versaries, especially the Chinese Com-
munist Party; to strengthening critical 
supply chains as well as our partner-
ships and alliances abroad. 
I believe that future generations will 
look back on this competition bill as 
the turning point for American leader-
ship in the 21st century. 
I think the depth of the bipartisan 
support reflects the process we took as 
well. The kernel of the bill is legisla-
tion I wrote with Senator TODD YOUNG, 
the Endless Frontier Act. We ulti-
mately included legislation from six 
committees 
and 
input 
from 
every 
Member. Over 3 weeks, the Senate con-
sidered more than 20 amendments, the 
vast majority from Republicans. In 
fact, the Senate even accepted an 
amendment from Senator PAUL
by 
voice vote. That doesn’t happen too 
often around here. 
Excluding budget resolutions, nearly 
as many amendments have received

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4000 
June 9, 2021 
rollcall votes on this one bill as on all 
the bills in 2017, when the Republicans 
were in the majority—nearly as many 
amendment votes on this one bill as 
over that entire year. We are running 
the Senate in a different way. 
So I want to thank my colleagues on 
both sides for their efforts, Senators 
CANTWELL and WICKER for their excel-
lent management of the bill, Senator 
YOUNG for working with me from the 
beginning until the very end, Senators 
MENENDEZ and RISCH as well as MUR-
RAY, DURBIN, PETERS, BROWN, and 
WYDEN, whom I am committing to 
working with to put real teeth into the 
anti-censorship provisions of this bill 
before it becomes law. Senator WYDEN 
has been a hallmark on that. 
Of course, the job is not done until 
the legislation moves through the 
House and onto the President’s desk. 
Now that the bill has passed the Sen-
ate, we are going to work with Speaker 
PELOSI
and the relevant committee 
chairs in the House to move this bill 
forward as quickly as possible. 
Of course, the House can bring in ad-
ditional priorities, but I am intent on 
seeing the major thrust of this legisla-
tion become law. The bill is so impor-
tant to the future of America that the 
House and Senate must come together 
and send President Biden a bill he is 
very, very eager to sign. 
Yesterday, the Senate took a bold, 
strong step toward boosting American 
science, technology, and innovation for 
decades. We are going to keep at it, 
keep at it until we cross the finish line. 
PAYCHECK FAIRNESS 
Mr. President, on paycheck fairness, 
almost immediately, however, we saw 
the limits of bipartisanship in the Sen-
ate last evening, right after we voted 
on USICA, the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act. 
Minutes after coming together to 
pass that sweeping competition bill, 
Senate Republicans mounted a par-
tisan filibuster against a very straight-
forward piece of legislation to help pro-
vide equal pay to women. 
The vote was party line. Not a single 
Republican Senator voted in favor of 
even debating the bill. Sure, my col-
leagues might not like every aspect of 
Democratic legislation. I understand 
that. But if you want to change the 
bill, you have to let the Senate debate 
it and amend it. 
It is shocking that my Republican 
colleagues believe that the Senate has 
no role to play in defending the rights 
of women who are unfairly and ille-
gally discriminated against in the 
workplace. For a reason that I can’t 
understand, the issue of pay equity has 
become a partisan one, sadly. Demo-
crats in favor; Republicans opposed— 
despite the fact that the issue isn’t all 
that partisan out in the country. A 
solid majority of voters see pay equity 
as a problem and believe Congress has 
a role to play in solving it. 
It reminds me of gun safety. Ninety 
to ninety-five percent of America sup-
ports expanding background checks so 
that people who shouldn’t get a gun— 
felons and others—don’t. The vast ma-
jority of Republicans in the country, 
the vast majority of gun owners in the 
country, support that policy. Only in 
DC, among Republicans here in the 
Senate and in the House, is that issue 
remotely partisan, where Washington 
Republicans have traditionally opposed 
it. 
So before the press writes the latest 
Republican filibuster of equal pay leg-
islation as just another chapter in the 
typical partisan games, just remember 
that the only place this issue is par-
tisan is in Washington, with Repub-
licans way out of touch with what the 
American people want. 
Americans across the country expect 
their government to make progress on 
big issues, even if we don’t agree on ev-
erything. But yesterday, sadly, Senate 
Republicans once again chose the path 
of obstruction and gridlock. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, finally, on judges, yes-
terday, the Senate confirmed the first 
two judges of President Biden’s ten-
ure—now—Judges Neals of New Jersey 
and Rodriguez of Colorado. 
These judges are only the first of 
many to come. The Democratic major-
ity in the Senate is going to move 
quickly to confirm Biden’s judicial ap-
pointments. So after the two confirma-
tions yesterday, we wasted no time in 
preparing the next slate of nominees. 
Last night, I took the necessary step 
to set up votes on two more judges— 
Zahid Quraishi for the District Court of 
New Jersey and Kentanji Brown Jack-
son to serve on the powerful DC Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
Democrats believe in not only bring-
ing demographic diversity but profes-
sional diversity to the Federal bench. 
In fact, this morning I had the privi-
lege of introducing my recommenda-
tion to the Second Circuit Court of Ap-
peals in the Judiciary Committee, Ms. 
Eunice Lee. 
Once confirmed, Ms. Lee would be-
come 
the 
second 
African-American 
woman ever to sit on this powerful and 
important Second Circuit and would be 
the 
only 
former 
Federal 
defender 
among its active roster of judges. 
As I mentioned, we believe in demo-
graphic diversity but professional di-
versity as well. All too often, the bench 
has been filled with a very narrow sec-
tor—partners in big law firms, prosecu-
tors. What about the rest? What about 
public defenders like Ms. Lee? What 
about voting rights lawyers, like Mr. 
Ho 
and 
Ms. 
Perez, 
whom 
I 
rec-
ommended to the President this week? 
We must defend—we must expand not 
only demographic diversity but profes-
sional diversity. And I know that 
President Biden agrees with me on 
this, and this will be something that I 
will set out to do not only in New 
York, along with Senator GILLIBRAND, 
but across the country. 
And the two other nominees I men-
tioned are powerful examples as well. 
Mr. Quraishi will be the first American 
Muslim in U.S. history to serve as an 
article III Federal judge. The third 
largest religion in the United States, 
he will become the first to ever serve 
as an article III judge, and we will con-
firm his nomination this week. 
And next up is the nomination of 
Judge Jackson. After a sterling career 
as a district court judge, a Federal de-
fender, a Commissioner on the Sen-
tencing Commission, and a clerk to 
Justice Breyer, Ms. Brown Jackson is 
poised to take a seat on the DC Circuit 
Court of Appeals, the second highest 
court in the land. She will fill the seat 
of now-Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land. 
Oftentimes, nominees to the powerful 
DC Circuit Court are controversial, in 
spite of their qualifications, because 
the stakes are so high. But I am proud 
to say that Ms. Brown Jackson came 
out of the Judiciary Committee on a 
bipartisan—a 
bipartisan—vote, 
and 
soon the entire Senate will confirm 
this highly qualified jurist to one of 
the most important positions 
and 
courts in the country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
was disappointed to learn yesterday 
that President Biden had walked away 
from negotiations on infrastructure 
spending with Senator CAPITO. 
For several weeks, the ranking mem-
ber of the EPW Committee has been en-
gaged in good faith on finding common 
ground with the administration. She 
has led several of our colleagues in lit-
erally exhaustive efforts to put a bipar-
tisan deal within reach. 
Senate Republicans proposed historic 
investments in the kinds of things 
most Americans would call actual in-
frastructure. They met and exceeded 
the 
President’s 
own 
threshold 
de-
mands, and then they were left at the 
table. 
Our colleagues weren’t wrong to bet 
on bipartisanship. For one thing, it is 
what the American people actually de-
serve. For another, as I have noted be-
fore, infrastructure investments have 
historically featured overwhelming bi-
partisan consensus. But an agreement 
requires that actually each side is will-
ing to give up some of what it wants. 
And as we learned yesterday, President 
Biden is unwilling to let go of some of 
the most radical promises he made to 
the leftwing of his party. 
From the day the White House rolled 
out its first ‘‘infrastructure’’ plan in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4001 
June 9, 2021 
March, it has been clear that the left’s 
definition of the word is evolving faster 
than even some Democrats can actu-
ally keep up with. Medicaid expansion 
is now infrastructure, paid leave is now 
infrastructure, and job-killing tax in-
creases to hold the assortment all to-
gether. 
At every step of the way, Repub-
licans have focused on targeted invest-
ments in roads, bridges, airports, wa-
terways, and broadband infrastructure 
the American people actually need. 
But 
yesterday, 
President 
Biden 
showed that his patience for the smart, 
bipartisan approach was wearing thin. 
He directed Democratic leaders in Con-
gress to get ready to ram through more 
expansive, unrelated spending unilater-
ally. 
Meanwhile, Senator CAPITO and our 
colleagues on the EPW Committee con-
tinue to demonstrate that bipartisan 
infrastructure investment is actually 
still within reach. 
In April, the Senate passed their 
water infrastructure bill by a count of 
89 to 2. And just a couple weeks ago, 
the committee reported out a historic 
investment to surface transportation, 
and they did it unanimously. It is dis-
appointing that President Biden has 
been unwilling to follow the Senate’s 
productive example. 
And now some of our colleagues have 
signaled that they intend to use this 
month to depart from that example, 
themselves. The Democratic leader has 
laid out a partisan agenda he seems to 
hope will illustrate that the Senate is 
somehow broken. 
Remember, the Senate is 50–50—50–50. 
The American people did not hand the 
Democrats a mandate in the Senate. 
This series of radical proposals has no 
chance of becoming law, but every in-
tention of justifying reckless changes 
to the way the body actually oper-
ates—plans to jam hospitals, schools, 
and small businesses with new high- 
stakes tests of ‘‘wokeness,’’ to dra-
matically curtail Americans’ right to 
keep and bear arms, and, of course, to 
tip the scales of our electoral system 
permanently in their favor. 
Yesterday, the radical parade began 
with an attempt to use the cause of 
paycheck fairness as cover for placing 
unprecedented new legal burdens on 
American employers. Wage discrimina-
tion on the basis of sex has been illegal 
for 60 years. Wage discrimination on 
the basis of sex has been illegal for 60 
years. What Democrats proposed yes-
terday was to kick down carefully con-
structed protections to leave even the 
smallest American business at risk of 
unlimited 
liability 
in 
workplace 
cases—listen to this—even where mal-
ice plays no part. Their bill would force 
workers to opt out of, rather than into, 
class-action suits—in other words, a 
gift-wrapped bonanza for the trial bar. 
Unsurprisingly, that gambit not only 
failed to pass; it failed to even unite a 
majority of the Senate. 
So if our colleagues intended to actu-
ally earn support for consensus steps 
on paycheck fairness, they might have 
considered subjecting their proposal to 
scrutiny through the normal legisla-
tive process—perhaps a markup or even 
a committee hearing. 
Well, apparently when your agenda is 
designed to fail, regular order is just a 
waste of time. 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, I have been outspoken 
on the importance of sustaining Amer-
ica’s support for local partners who are 
leading counterterrorism efforts in Af-
ghanistan and elsewhere, even when 
doing so has put me at odds with the 
Presidents, actually, of both parties. 
When the previous administration 
considered 
precipitous 
withdrawals 
from Afghanistan and Syria, I spon-
sored a bipartisan amendment warning 
that doing so could ‘‘allow terrorists to 
regroup . . . to the detriment of United 
States interests and those of our al-
lies.’’ 
Dozens of Senate Democrats joined 
the measure at that point. 
Last year, the Congress overrode 
veto threats and put explicit restric-
tions and reporting requirements on 
force drawdowns in the annual Defense 
authorization act. I and others voted to 
override the veto of a Republican 
President. The goal wasn’t to tie the 
hands of the Commander in Chief. It 
was to force the administration to seri-
ously address the risks to U.S. inter-
ests posed by any potential with-
drawal. 
But 
this 
spring, 
when 
President 
Biden announced his intention to aban-
don the battlefield in Afghanistan com-
pletely—completely—without a plan, 
there was a bit less outrage, for some 
reason, on the Democratic side of the 
aisle. 
And yesterday, the President moved 
to waive the NDAA requirements that 
Senate Democrats themselves had sup-
ported in order to proceed with this 
misguided retreat. 
The White House has yet to address 
the obvious risks of our departure: that 
the Taliban will regain control, al- 
Qaida will return to strength, and the 
people 
of 
Afghanistan—particularly, 
women and girls—will suffer. 
We don’t have to wait long for these 
fears to prove prescient. The Taliban 
has wasted no time in ramping up its 
campaign to drag more of the country 
back under its oppressive medieval 
rule—more killing of soldiers, journal-
ists, and activists; more oppression of 
women; and more ambitious oper-
ational goals. 
As one Taliban commander put it, 
‘‘when we arrive in Kabul, we will ar-
rive as conquerors.’’ Well, they are 
inching closer every day while we with-
draw, and this is all happening, as I 
just indicated, before our retreat is 
even complete. 
Experts are still unsure just how 
quickly the Taliban’s resurgence will 
accelerate as we depart. That is bad 
news for our partners in Kabul. It is 
bad news for the Afghan military, 
which is losing its edge without coali-
tion support on the ground. And it is 
especially bad news for Afghanistan’s 
women and girls. I know many of my 
colleagues share my concern for our 
partners in Afghanistan and for the 
many Afghan women who have re-
claimed so much of their freedom since 
2001. So make no mistake, their future 
will be imperiled under Taliban rule. 
Rhetorical support for Senate resolu-
tions and hollow promises of assistance 
from afar might ease our consciences 
somewhat, but they cannot take the 
place of the coalition forces in sup-
porting our partners and vulnerable 
populations in Afghanistan. That won’t 
prevent the resurgence of al-Qaida, 
with whom a recent United Nations re-
port found Taliban militants ‘‘show no 
indication of breaking ties.’’ 
So where is the plan? Where is the 
plan to deal with these challenges as 
we abandon our partners and leave 
them to the Taliban? 
How does the administration intend 
to combat terror or support Afghan 
forces if we are hundreds of miles 
away? How does it intend to counter 
the 
negative 
influence 
of 
Russia, 
China, Pakistan, Iran, and others who 
might see our departure as massive op-
portunity? Have we learned nothing 
from Russia’s intervention in Syria? 
So later this week, President Biden 
will meet in person with leaders of our 
NATO allies, many of whom have ex-
pressed concerns about the risks of a 
precipitous withdrawal from Afghani-
stan. But, of course, as we withdraw, 
they will, as well, because without us 
there won’t be a NATO presence in Af-
ghanistan. 
So for the sake of American security 
and the strength of our partnerships, it 
is time for the President to finally 
offer some clear answers to advance 
our shared interest in combating ter-
rorists who still mean us harm and to 
restore faith in our resolve to finish 
things that we start. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-

CYBERSECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week, we learned that global meat 
processing company JBS, one of the 
four meatpacking companies respon-
sible for more than 80 percent of beef 
processing operations, had suffered a 
ransomeware attack. The attack tem-
porarily shuttered the company’s U.S. 
beef plants, threatening the beef supply 
and leaving ranchers wondering once 
again whether they would be able to 
sell their cattle. 
The JBS attack highlights two im-
portant issues. The first is cyber secu-
rity. The rise of ransomeware attacks

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4002 
June 9, 2021 
on critical industries and infrastruc-
ture represents a serious threat. 
Less 
than 
a 
month 
before 
the 
ransomeware attack on meatpacking, 
ransomeware criminals hacked the Co-
lonial Pipeline, which supplies gasoline 
and jet fuel to the east coast. The Colo-
nial attack caused fuel shortages and 
drove up gas prices, with many con-
sumers facing gas station lines that 
hearkened back to the oil crisis of the 
1970s. 
In today’s society, where almost ev-
erything we do has a cyber component, 
ransomeware 
and 
other 
malicious 
cyber attacks carry the potential to se-
riously disrupt our way of life. 
Cyber security needs to be one of our 
top priorities. Private companies need 
to invest in cyber security, to keep 
their systems and customer data se-
cure, and the Federal Government has 
to invest in it as a matter of national 
security. We can’t afford to let hostile 
individuals 
or 
hostile 
governments 
hack key government databases or 
functions. 
I was proud to be a lead sponsor of 
the HACKED Act, which became law as 
part of the 2021 National Defense Au-
thorization Act. This legislation fo-
cuses on enhancing both public and pri-
vate cyber security development. It 
bolsters science education and cyber 
security programs at multiple govern-
ment Agencies, and enhances partner-
ships between universities and employ-
ers on cyber security workforce needs. 
We need to continue to make cyber 
security training a priority. We also 
need to send a clear message to govern-
ments that harbor cyber attackers. It 
is obvious that Russia remains a haven 
for cyber criminals. Both the Colonial 
Pipeline and JBS attacks were the 
work of Russia-linked hackers, and we 
need to make it clear to Russia and 
other countries that we have no toler-
ance for the harboring of cyber crimi-
nals. 
MEATPACKING INDUSTRY 
The JBS attack also highlighted a 
second 
problem—the 
highly 
con-
centrated nature of the meatpacking 
industry. When one or more of a hand-
ful 
of 
companies 
controlling 
the 
meatpacking industry experiences a 
problem, whether that is a plant shut-
down due to COVID transmission or a 
cyber attack, that creates a poten-
tially serious problem for the entire 
U.S. meat supply. 
We all remember seeing bare meat 
department shelves at times during the 
pandemic. Had meatpacking capacity 
been less concentrated, it is likely that 
we would not have seen such signifi-
cant shortages. 
This high level of concentration in 
the industry also creates a problem for 
livestock 
producers, 
who 
rely 
on 
meatpackers to buy and harvest their 
animals and get them to consumers. 
If a meatpacker has to shut down a 
plant, that means that farmers or 
ranchers may lose out on getting their 
livestock to market. 
The highly concentrated nature of 
the meatpacking industry also creates 
the opportunity for market manipula-
tion. In fact, serious concerns have 
been raised about market manipulation 
in the beef industry, owing to the sub-
stantial and ongoing gulf between 
meatpacker profits and rancher profits. 
I recently sent a letter to the chair-
man of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee requesting that the committee 
hold an oversight hearing into poten-
tial anticompetitive behavior and anti-
trust violations of the meatpacking 
sector. This followed on my letter to 
the Attorney General, urging the Jus-
tice Department to disclose the results 
of 
its 
investigation 
into 
the 
meatpacking industry, and my request 
to the Senate Agriculture Committee 
to hold a hearing examining the chal-
lenges livestock producers have been 
facing. 
I will continue to work to make sure 
any anticompetitive behavior in the 
beef-packing industry is addressed. 
I will continue to support efforts to 
increase 
competition 
in 
the 
meatpacking industry, like my legisla-
tion to support small meatpackers, the 
Strengthening Local Processing Act. I 
introduced this legislation in Feb-
ruary, along with Senator MERKLEY, to 
help strengthen and diversify national 
meat processing capacity by providing 
new resources for smaller, more local 
meat processing operations. 
As I said, more than 80 percent of the 
beef-packing industry in this country 
is controlled by just four companies. 
Encouraging more companies to get 
into this marketplace and encouraging 
small meatpackers to expand will di-
lute the power of these four companies 
and create more competition for ranch-
ers’ cattle, which will lead to higher 
prices for ranchers—higher prices for 
ranchers—when they bring their cattle 
to the market. 
Plus, spreading out and expanding 
our Nation’s meat processing capacity 
will make our Nation’s meat supply 
less vulnerable to interruptions in situ-
ations like the pandemic or other nat-
ural disasters or the JBS ransomware

South Dakota cattle producers work 
hard every day to deliver top-quality 
beef to our Nation and to the world. I 
am proud to represent them here in the

enhance 
competition

the 
meatpacking industry so that ranchers 
and all livestock producers can receive 
a competitive price for their livestock.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

dered. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
right to vote is the most fundamental 
and essential feature of our democracy. 
As Abraham Lincoln said, a govern-
ment of the people, by the people, and 
for the people would not be possible if 
it weren’t for citizens who cast their 
ballot at every available election. 
From city councils, to school boards, 
to Presidents of the United States, the 
American people have a right and, I 
would argue, a duty to make their 
voices heard. In 2020, a record number 
of voters did just that. Nearly 160 mil-
lion Americans cast their ballot, ac-
counting for roughly two-thirds of all 
eligible voters. If you compare that to 
2016, just 4 years earlier, 17 million 
more people voted in the last election. 
This included higher turnout across all 
racial 
and 
ethnic 
groups—African 
Americans, 
Caucasians, 
Hispanics, 
Asians. Each had a higher turnout this 
election. 
When Congress originally passed the 
Voting Rights Act in 1965, the goal was 
to eliminate common discriminatory 
practices that were in place at that 
time. It was and it is a landmark piece 
of legislation. There is no question it 
has been an overwhelming success, and 
I think that is something we should 
celebrate as a nation. 
In 2012, for the first time on record, 
turnout among Black voters was high-
er than for White voters. In 2020, both 
Asian and Hispanic voters turned out 
at the highest rate on record. We cer-
tainly have come a long way, as the 
preamble to the Constitution says, in 
our effort to form a more perfect 
Union, but we should not tire, nor fal-
ter, nor fail in our progress to make 
sure that everyone who has the right to 
vote has an opportunity to cast their 
ballot. 
Before every election—and 2020 was 
no different—there is a widespread ef-
fort to register new voters and encour-
age more citizens to participate. In 
Texas, we set new records in reg-
istering and turning out voters. We 
turned out 11.3 million voters, 66 per-
cent of those registered. In the years to 
come, I hope we will set new records 
and get more voters to the polls. I 
think that goal should be shared by 
every American. 
But in addition to this work, we have 
a responsibility to protect the integ-
rity of the ballot. This became a focus 
in particular after the 2016 election 
when we actually saw Russia try to 
interfere with the Presidential election 
that year. 
In response, Congress provided hun-
dreds of millions of dollars to shore up 
State election security measures and 
to help local officials safeguard future 
elections. Our intelligence community 
and particularly the National Security 
Agency and Cyber Command made sure 
that there were no cyber attacks or 
minimized the impact of potential 
cyber attacks on election voting sys-
tems, including voter registries and the 
like. The postmortem reviews were 
that they were pretty successful in de-
terring those sorts of attacks that oc-
curred in 2016.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4003 
June 9, 2021 
But it is not just up to the Federal 
Government; 
across 
the 
country, 
States are also fighting to make sure 
that those who are legally entitled to 
vote can do so and ensure the integrity 
of their own elections. They are look-
ing at ways to make it easier to vote 
and harder to cheat, which I think 
should be our goal. But those election 
security 
efforts 
have 
been 
mischaracterized, 
unfortunately, 
by 
many of our Democratic colleagues and 
many in the news media who falsely 
claim that somehow there are efforts 
underway at the State level to suppress 
minority voters. 
We saw this play out in the case of 
the Georgia election law in particular. 
Our Democratic colleagues tried to 
frame this legislation as a way to sup-
press minority voters, but that was 
completely contrary to the facts, and 
it was completely contrary to the elec-
tion laws in their own States. 
The Georgia law, for example, set a 
deadline of 11 days before an election 
to request a mail-in ballot. In the home 
State of the Democratic leader, Sen-
ator SCHUMER from New York, voters 
only get a week—11 days in Georgia; a 
week in New York. And in New York, 
you have to give a reason for voting ab-
sentee. In Georgia, under the proposed 
changes to the State election law, you 
don’t even have to give a reason to 
vote absentee. 
Georgia also expanded early in-per-
son voting to 17 days. In Massachu-
setts, represented by two of our Demo-
cratic colleagues, early voting lasts 
only 11 days. 
The President’s home State of Dela-
ware won’t even offer early voting 
until 2022. In other words, you can’t 
even do it now, and it won’t be avail-
able until 2022, and even then, voters 
will have only 10 days. 
Well, I think this demonstrates the 
hypocrisy of some of the debate we are 
hearing and seeing. 
New 
Jersey, 
represented 
by 
two 
Democratic Senators and a Democratic 
Governor, recently passed a law that 
expanded in-person voting to 9 days. As 
a reminder, Georgia just expanded 
theirs to 17 days. But the New Jersey 
Governor had the temerity to criticize 
Georgia for ‘‘restricting the rights of 
Georgians to vote’’ when it is more ex-
pansive than the voting laws in his own 
State. 
We have heard similar lines of attack 
from many across the aisle who falsely 
try to brand this law as a form of voter 
suppression. Once you play the race 
card, it is hard for people to think 
clearly because it tugs at our emo-
tions. It tugs at our collective, frankly, 
guilt, emanating from the earliest days 
of our country that we have come a 
long way to try to rectify. 
But here is the bottom line: Each 
State has the authority to determine 
the ‘‘times, places, and manner of hold-
ing elections.’’ Where does that come 
from? Well, that is article I of the Con-
stitution of the United States of Amer-
ica. But our Democratic colleagues in-
sist on pushing for a one-size-fits-all 
mandate that turns federalism, includ-
ing the Constitution itself, on its head. 
Senator SCHUMER, the Senator from 
New York, has said that this month, 
the Senate will vote on a bill called S. 
1, which is the Democrats’ effort to 
commandeer control of elections from 
the States. The bill is so radical that 
Members of his own party have lined 
up against it, and it is easy, on super-
ficial inspection, to see why. 
In order to vote in person, 36 States 
require some form of voter identifica-
tion. That was the recommendation of 
the Commission that former President 
Carter participated in, along with 
James Baker III—a prominent Presi-
dent, a Democrat, and a prominent Re-
publican. They made a recommenda-
tion for voter ID, but this proposal, S. 
1, would eliminate it. 
In my State, Texas, there are several 
options to present voter identification. 
You can present a driver’s license, a 
passport, a military ID, a citizenship 
certificate. If you don’t have any of 
those, you can get another one issued 
by the State at zero cost. Those all 
work. 
This Democratic proposal would stop 
States, would actually block the States 
from requiring voter identification— 
something you have to do when you 
buy a six-pack of beer or cigarettes, for 
those who still smoke, or get on an air-
plane or even enter a Federal building. 
You have to produce an identification 
to do so. But S. 1 would prohibit the 
States from making that requirement 
when exercising your most sacred right 
as a citizen. What would they require? 
Well, you sign a piece of paper saying 
you are who you say you are, and no-
body can ask you any questions. 
The invitation for fraud doesn’t stop 
there because this proposed legislation 
also legalizes something called ballot 
harvesting. That means that mail-in 
ballots could be collected by political 
partisans, whether it is paid campaign 
staffers or anyone who has a stake in 
the outcome of the election—not an 
impartial third party but a partisan 
who has a stake in the outcome of the 
election. They could harvest those bal-
lots. 
It goes so far as to specify that the 
States ‘‘may not put any limit on how 
many voted and sealed absentee ballots 
any designated person can return.’’ So 
there are no limits on how many bal-
lots a political operative could harvest 
and turn in and count in the election. 
Well, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist 
to figure out how this can go wrong. 
Maybe the ballots get turned in with 
thousands of others. Maybe some of the 
ballots are altered. Maybe some are 
falsified. Maybe some end up in the 
trash. It is tough to know exactly what 
might happen. 
S. 1, this Federal commandeering of 
State-run elections, is rife with oppor-
tunities for fraud. It mandates things 
like automatic voter registration and 
ballot drop boxes, while making it 
more difficult for the States to main-
tain accurate voter lists. 
It would even go so far as to make it 
harder for the States to remove dead 
voters from their rolls. My State, like 
many States, has an unfortunate leg-
acy of having candidates and political 
parties cast a ballot on behalf of voters 
who are no longer alive—box 13, for ex-
ample. Arguably, that is the way Lyn-
don Johnson beat Coke Stevenson, by 
voting the cemetery vote. And that is 
not unique. 
Why would Senator SCHUMER
and 
Speaker PELOSI be pushing this take-
over of State-run elections? Well, it is 
pretty obvious. They think that our 
Democratic colleagues will reap the 
benefits of hijacking State election 
laws. That is really their goal here. 
They want to put a thumb on the scale 
of future elections. They want to take 
power away from the voters and the 
States and give themselves every par-
tisan advantage they can. 
Those are just some of the features of 
S. 1. There are others. It would make 
changes to the Federal Election Com-
mission, which currently has six mem-
bers, three from each political party. 
This is intentionally designed to pro-
tect the Commission from partisan pol-
itics. Regardless of which party con-
trols the Senate or the White House, 
the FEC will always be fair and bal-
anced. Well, that doesn’t serve the in-
terests of our Democratic friends, so 
they want to change it. The election 
takeover bill would remove one of the 
seats held by a Republican and turn 
the Federal Election Commission into 
a partisan body—no more equal rep-
resentation, no more consensus build-
ing. Why bother with that when you 
can steamroll an agenda with no oppo-
sition? 
Then there is the taxpayer funding of 
elections. Instead of political can-
didates going out and making the case 
to prospective voters, instead of sup-
porters voluntarily backing their pre-
ferred candidates with their hard- 
earned dollars, this bill would force 
taxpayers to bear the financial burden, 
even to the point of channeling dollars, 
your tax dollars, to candidates whom 
you disagree with who support policies 
that you do not support. And it is not 
even a dollar-for-dollar match. I don’t 
know who came up with the idea of $6 
from the taxpayer for every dollar that 
is raised from voluntary donations, but 
that is the proposal. What a deal. That 
means if somebody gives a candidate 
200 bucks, the Federal Government 
could match it up to $1,200. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
even 
managed to get on the wrong side of 
the American Civil Liberties Union. 
This bill would implement a new dis-
closure policy that the ACLU says 
‘‘could directly interfere with the abil-
ity of many to engage in political 
speech about causes that they care 
about.’’ 
But as bad as this proposal is, S. 1, if 
that doesn’t work—and it is looking 
like, from reading the news recently, it 
is not likely to work because of defec-
tions, 
even 
among 
Democrats—our 
Democratic colleagues have a plan B.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4004 
June 9, 2021 
I want to remind you of what I said 
at the outset, that the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 was one of the most impor-
tant laws passed in modern American 
history. It has been reauthorized a 
number of times over the years, most 
recently in 2006. I proudly cast my vote 
in support of reauthorizing the Voting 
Rights Act. But a new bill introduced 
by 
our 
friend 
the 
Senator 
from 
Vermont, the senior Senator, some-
times invoking the name of that civil 
rights icon, John Lewis, his proposal 
would radically change the law as well, 
this time putting the Federal Govern-
ment, not the State, in charge of new 
voting laws again. 
Just a reminder: Back in 1965, part of 
the Voting Rights Act required States 
and jurisdictions with a history of dis-
crimination 
to 
receive 
Federal 
preclearance before they could put new 
laws into effect. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court of the 
United States struck down the portion 
of the law that set the formula for 
which States were included in that re-
quirement. The Court ruled that it was 
unconstitutional because the coverage 
formula was outdated. The Court said 
history did not end in 1965. 
Indeed, what happened when the Vot-
ing Rights Act was reauthorized in 
2006, the proponents of that bill made 
no accounting for the tremendous 
progress in minority voting turnout 
that we have seen since that time. In 
other words, the Voting Rights Act 
worked. It worked miraculously, and 
thank goodness it did. 
But the Supreme Court, in striking 
down the 1965 formula as opposed to 
the current-day rate of minority vot-
ing, the Court said the Congress based 
the law on 40-year-old facts having no 
logical relation to the present day. 
Here is an example: The formula in 
1965 
required 
States 
to 
receive 
preclearance before they could put 
their own voting laws into effect if 
they had any test or device, as it was 
called, that restricts voting. That in-
cluded things like literacy tests or sub-
jective determinations of moral char-
acter. But thanks to the Voting Rights 
Act, those practices are nowhere to be 
found today. 
The 
bill 
introduced 
by 
Senator 
LEAHY, 
the 
senior 
Senator 
from 
Vermont, would change the formula 
with language so broad that virtually 
every State in the Union and every 
local jurisdiction would have to get 
their election laws precleared by the 
Biden Justice Department before they 
could put them into effect. The trigger 
for that is a vague number of voting 
rights violations that wouldn’t even re-
quire a finding of intentional discrimi-
nation. Nevertheless, these State and 
local governments would be required to 
get the sign-off of partisan bureaucrats 
at the Department of Justice to exer-
cise their own constitutional author-
ity. 
I think it is important to keep in 
mind that the Framers of the Constitu-
tion wanted the States to chart their 
own course in elections, not Wash-
ington bureaucrats. To quote the Su-
preme Court of the United States, ‘‘The 
Framers of the Constitution intended 
the States to keep for themselves, as 
provided [under] the Tenth Amendment 
[to the Constitution], the power to reg-
ulate elections.’’ Yet, in any instance 
where your local election official want-
ed to make a commonsense change in 
the way your elections were actually 
carried out, you would have to ask 
‘‘Mother May I’’ to the Department of 
Justice. 
Based on this proposal, you would 
think there have been countless unen-
forced instances of voter discrimina-
tion that cry out for this sort of rem-
edy, but you would be wrong. 
The Department of Justice already 
has authority under section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act to prohibit discrimi-
nation on the basis of race, color, or 
membership in a language minority 
group. During the entire 8 years of the 
Obama—the Obama—Justice Depart-
ment, they filed only four enforcement 
cases in the whole United States under 
section 2—four. 
So the narrative of widespread voter 
suppression is nothing but a propa-
ganda tactic designed to support a po-
litical outcome. The push for a Federal 
takeover of elections is not about voter 
suppression at all. It is about unconsti-
tutionally seizing power and never let-
ting go. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Wyoming. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. 
BARRASSO. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I come to the floor to talk about 
the crisis that is occurring at our 
southern border. 
Joe Biden has been President now for 
about 4 months. In this time, illegal 
immigration at the southern border 
has more than doubled. We are now on 
a pace this year—this year alone—for 
the most illegal immigration in two 
decades. The numbers that we see, 
based on last month, we are talking 
about 2 million people coming to 
America this year illegally. 
It seems to me that, on the first day 
in office, President Biden signed Exec-
utive orders that flipped on the green 
light that said: Come to America. He 
rolled out the welcome mat, and he 
sent a clear message that our borders 
are open. He shut down construction of 
the border wall, a wall that we have ac-
tually paid to have done, to be con-
structed. I have been there. The parts 
are lying on the ground and the work-
ers stopped, on inauguration day, from 
putting up portions of the wall to close 
down the gaps. 
He stopped all deportations for 100 
days. He brought back the program 
known as catch-and-release. And since 
he took these actions—and I have 
talked to the Border Patrol on the 
ground, and they say the border has 
been overwhelmed. 
Now, illegal immigrants are coming 
from all over the world. People say: 
Well, it is an issue between Mexico and 
the United States. The people coming 
here are coming from all over the 
world. At the time I was there, we 
heard that over 50 countries have been 
represented in the people who have 
been captured, including Romania, Ar-
menia, Bangladesh. People are flying 
to Mexico who can’t come to the 
United States because of paperwork, 
who they are, what their intentions 
may be. They aren’t allowed to get 
tickets to come to the United States so 
they fly to Mexico to come into the 
United States illegally. 
The entire world knows that the bor-
der is open because that is the message 
sent out by this administration. And 
that, of course, includes criminals. 
Border agents have already arrested 95 
convicted sex offenders. Border agents 
have arrested 95 convicted sex offend-
ers coming into the country illegally, 
and this includes the last number of 
months. 
And I will tell you, the sex offenders 
include a man from El Salvador who 
was convicted of raping a child in 
Washington State. We are talking 
about people who have been convicted 
in the United States, who are now out 
of the country, coming back in—con-
viction in Washington State. It also in-
cluded a man from El Salvador who 
was convicted of sexually abusing a 9- 
year-old girl. This abuse took place in 
New York City, which is a sanctuary 
city. 
This is what happens when our bor-
ders are open and the message is sent 
out around the world. And for the open 
borders crowd who like this sort of 
thing, some of whom are Members of 
the Congress of the United States, this 
is just collateral damage. It is all part 
of a political agenda. 
It has been more than 2 months since 
President Biden put Vice President 
HARRIS in charge of the border. She has 
found time to make it to the Canadian 
border but not time to make it to the 
border between the United States and 
Mexico. 
This week, and right now, the Vice 
President has been on her first over-
seas trip in the role as Vice President. 
She is going to Central America and to 
Mexico but not to the border. She has 
announced new gifts of American tax-
payer dollars given to people from 
other countries. 
When reporters asked her—and she 
did; I saw the sitdown interview and 
the video of it—if she was going to the 
border, 
she 
actually 
laughed. 
She 
thought it was a joke. It was very dis-
appointing to see the Vice President 
acting in that way. She said: ‘‘I haven’t 
been to Europe either,’’ like it didn’t 
matter. She hadn’t been to Europe; 
there are a lot of places she hadn’t 
been. The place the American people 
know she hasn’t been is to the border 
between Mexico and the United States. 
In reality, she knows. She knows 
that if she goes to the border—she 
knows that if she goes to the border be-
tween the United States and Mexico,

she knows that the news cameras will 
go with her. She knows that the media 
would broadcast the crisis that they 
see at the border to the whole world. 
She knows that, then, more and more 
Americans will see firsthand the truth 
for themselves. That is why the Vice 
President is not going to the border be-
tween Mexico and the United States. 
The White House refuses to say it is 
a crisis. They refuse to say those 
words. They just want to use the word 
‘‘challenge’’ instead of the reality of 
the crisis that I saw when I was there 
at the border with a group of Repub-
lican Senators. That is why they are 
doubling down on policies that caused 
the crisis. 
Two weeks ago, the President re-
leased his budget for the coming year. 
It is the biggest budget proposal by any 
President 
in 
American 
history. 
It 
would nearly double Federal spending 
over the next decade. Yet the Presi-
dent’s budget for the Department of 
Homeland Security, the Department 
that is supposed to keep our Nation 
safe, is flatlined. The President likes to 
say—and he has said it time and time 
again. He said it when he was in the 
Senate; he said it as Vice President of 
the United States; and now he says it 
as the President. He said: If you want 
to know somebody’s values, just look 
at their budget. 
Well, we have seen Joe Biden’s budg-
et, and we know his values. And his 
values are not those of supporting and 
promoting the security of our Nation 
through border security. The Presi-
dent’s budget includes $800 million in 
aid for Central America. I don’t know 
if Joe Biden thinks you can bribe peo-
ple with our own tax dollars to not 
cross the border. It is an absolute sur-
render, and it leaves our borders wide 
open. 
Our southern border is in crisis, but 
the crisis isn’t limited to the border 
itself. President Biden has also tied the 
hands of our immigration officials all 
across America. The Washington Post 
came out with a story, and they put it 
this way. I want to make sure I have it 
absolutely accurate so I am going to 
read it to you. 
It says: Under President Biden, ICE— 
Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment—‘‘is an agency on probation.’’ 
This is the Washington Post. It says: 
Biden has placed ICE deportation officers 
on a leash so tight that some say their work 
is being functionally abolished. 
That is the Washington Post on the 
President of the United States and 
what he has done with regard to our 
borders and our immigration authori-
ties with his very flatlined budget for 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
The article goes on, and it says: 
ICE carried out fewer than 3,000 deporta-
tions last month. The agency’s 6,000 officers 
currently average one arrest every two 
months. 
One arrest every 2 months. 
Hundreds of thousands of illegal 
aliens have court orders for deporta-
tion. Yet, despite these enormous num-
bers, deportations have never been 
lower, never been lower. No wonder the 
crisis is getting worse. 
I heard about it all last week over 
Memorial Day as I traveled around the 
State of Wyoming. People are very 
concerned about this disregard for our 
borders and for the support that our 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
officers need. So it is no wonder to me 
that the people of Wyoming are con-
cerned, and I imagine that people all 
around the country are concerned. My 
colleagues heard it as well, as they 
traveled their home States just in the 
last week. 
The border really is one of the top 
issues that I am asked about every 
weekend in Wyoming. I will be heading 
home again tomorrow night for the 
weekend, traveling the State, and I ex-
pect to hear more and more about it 
this coming weekend. The American 
people want to keep the borders secure, 
and they want to be safe at home. 
We know what to do. We know what 
works. The border agents told Presi-
dent Biden’s transition team before he 
was inaugurated what we needed to do 
to keep the border secure, what works, 
what wouldn’t work. They say enforce 
the law, close the loopholes, the loop-
holes that encourage illegal immigra-
tion. They say finish the wall, the wall 
that we have already paid for. And 
they say bring back the policy known 
as ‘‘Remain in Mexico.’’ 
Until we take these basic steps, the 
crisis is going to continue, the border 
is going to remain open, and the Amer-
ican people will continue to come to us 
to say there is more that can be done 
and should be done and must be done 
because the American people know 
that when the border is not secure, 
that people of America continue to be 
at heightened risk. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise for the sixth time to call for this 
entire body to have the opportunity to 
consider and cast their votes on the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. This com-
monsense reform would ensure that 
people in the military who are sub-
jected to sexual assault and other seri-
ous crimes have the opportunity to get 
the justice that they deserve. 
Under the current system, fewer than 
1 in 10 sexual assault cases that are 
considered for command action are 
sent to trial, and under the current 
culture, nearly 2 in 3 sexual assault 
survivors experience some form of re-
taliation for reporting that crime. 
That means a survivor of sexual as-
sault is far more likely to face con-
sequences than an assailant. 
When a 2016 Pentagon survey showed 
that 58 percent of survivors perceived 
retaliation for reporting their assaults, 
commanders said it was unacceptable, 
and Congress demanded action; but in-
stead of working to change the system 
or the culture, the response was to 
make retaliation a specific crime, de-
spite the fact that it already was a 
chargeable offense under title 10, sec-
tion 1034 of the United States Code. It 
was nothing more than window dress-
ing. We know that is true because, in 
2018, when the same survey came out 
again, the perceived retaliation rate 
went up to 64 percent. 
The DOD estimates that 20,500 serv-
icemembers 
are 
sexually 
assaulted 
each year. So you may wonder: How 
many documented prosecutions for re-
taliation did we see in the most recent 
year? The answer: One. Only one per-
son has been charged for retaliation in 
the last year, and there have been zero 
convictions reported. To me, that 
seems more of a joke. 
Under our bill, the ability to charge 
and prosecute retaliation would move 
outside the chain of command, giving 
survivors more confidence to come for-
ward in knowing the prosecutors would 
be free to protect them. Under the sta-
tus quo and under the chairman’s pro-
posal, the ability to prosecute remains 
in the wrong hands. 
It is time to remove retaliation and 
other serious crimes from the purview 
of the chain of command. It is time to 
professionalize the military justice 
system to remove bias, protect our 
servicemembers, and deliver justice. 
The numbers speak for themselves, 
and every single number represents a 
person—a survivor, a family member. 
We owe it to our survivors—those who 
have gone through the horrific experi-
ence of being assaulted only to experi-
ence 
retaliation 
from 
their 
fellow 
brothers and sisters in arms—to change 
this system. The Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act will make the changes that they 
need. 
Every day we delay a vote on this 
legislation is another day we deny jus-
tice to our servicemembers—the people 
who do so much for and give so much 
to our country. There is no reason to 
make them wait any longer. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that, at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Committee 
on Armed Services be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate, equal-
ly divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of that 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4006 
June 9, 2021 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, the chair-
man of our committee and I have both 
agreed that we need to be debating this 
during our markup, and we intend to 
do that. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise to 
support my colleague and friend from 
New York in the call for the consider-
ation of the Military Justice Improve-
ment and Increasing Prevention Act. 
This is an effort whose time is well 
past due. 
For too long, our servicemembers 
have faced the threat and traumas of 
sexual assault in their own ranks. We 
must act to prevent these attacks and 
hold perpetrators accountable. Sixty- 
five other Members of this Chamber 
recognize the urgency of our service-
members’ plight. It is time for debate 
and consideration. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor in advance of next 
week’s summit in Geneva during which 
President Biden will meet with Russian 
President Vladimir Putin for the first 
time as Commander in Chief, and I 
would like to share my views on the 
current state of U.S.-Russian relations 
and how we must respond to the Krem-
lin’s continued aggression. 
I have spent years deeply engaged in 
efforts to hold Russia accountable for 
its aggressive and destabilizing behav-
ior under Putin. 
During the Obama administration, I 
worked to hold Russia accountable for 
its invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, I was 
sanctioned by Putin himself for taking 
up the cause of Ukrainian sovereignty 
and freedom. 
During the 2016 election cycle, I 
sounded the alarm over Russian efforts 
to sow chaos in our elections long be-
fore we knew of the extent and sophis-
tication of the Russian cyber campaign 
to undermine American democracy. 
Throughout the previous administra-
tion, I called out President Trump for 
cowering to Putin at every turn. 
Trump’s refusal to hold Putin to ac-
count for attacking our elections was a 
key motivator behind the Senate’s pas-
sage of the Countering America’s Ad-
versaries Through Sanctions Act, oth-
erwise known as CAATSA. This com-
prehensive framework for oversight 
and accountability in U.S. policy to-
wards Russia remains the law of the 
land and the guiding mandate for how 
the United States must respond to 
Kremlin aggression. 
Now, I appreciate the Biden adminis-
tration’s desire for a stable and pre-
dictable relationship with Russia, but 
sometimes we don’t get to choose the 
circumstances 
of 
our 
engagement. 
When we take stock of Russia’s behav-
ior in recent years, we see that in 
every arena Putin has chosen esca-
lation over stability and predictability. 
Next week in Geneva, I have every 
expectation that President Biden will 
be more assertive with Putin than his 
predecessor. I urge him to seize this op-
portunity to call out the Kremlin for 
its litany of aggressive actions and an-
nounce appropriate measures in re-
sponse. 
The President can start with Russia’s 
growing aggression in cyber space, 
starting with last year’s SolarWinds 
cyber attack. We know that Putin’s 
foreign 
intelligence 
service 
orches-
trated this attack and that he must be 
held accountable for it as well as the 
more recent hack of USAID and its 
network of contractors and grantees. 
While I am unaware of any evidence 
that the most recent ransomware at-
tacks on U.S. infrastructure were or-
chestrated by the Russian state, we 
know, however, that criminal gangs op-
erate on Russian soil, and we believe 
that it is those criminal gangs that did 
such attacks. The United States has to 
make clear that harboring criminals 
who seek to attack American busi-
nesses, hospitals, pipelines, city gov-
ernments, and other institutions is 
wholly unacceptable. 
Let me move on to Ukraine. I urge 
President Biden to reiterate our policy 
of nonrecognition of Russia’s illegal 
annexation of Crimea and a call for a 
serious return to the negotiations to 
end the war in the Donbas. The United 
States must have a seat at the table in 
the Normandy Format and make a con-
certed effort to end the war on Ukrain-
ian soil that has gone on for far too 
long. An acceptable resolution to this 
conflict will not come without robust 
U.S. engagement the likes of which we 
have not seen for years. 
I am glad that President Zelensky 
will visit Washington in the next 
month or so, and we look forward to 
meeting him in the Senate. 
NATO, too, shares a responsibility to 
take concrete steps next week in sup-
port of Ukraine. The essential security 
assistance provided by the United 
States and others must be backed up 
by tangible progress towards NATO 
membership for Ukraine and Georgia. 
The door was opened 13 years ago at 
the Bucharest summit. We have seen 
little progress since then. As these 
countries continue to pursue the nec-
essary reforms necessary for ultimate 
entrance into NATO, NATO has an ob-
ligation to start the membership ac-
tion plan process. 
On Nord Stream, the administration 
should reconsider sanctions waivers on 
NS2 AG and Matthias Warnig. If the 
pipeline 
is 
completed, 
the 
United 
States should work to ensure that it 
does not become operational. This 
pipeline is a bad deal for Europe and its 
energy security and strongly opposed 
by citizens across the European con-
tinent. Despite what some have said, it 
is not too late for the United States to 
make a tangible difference here. We 
can stop this malign Kremlin influence 
project if we act with resolve and real 
diplomatic strategy. 
Last week, Putin said that Ukraine 
must show good will—Ukraine must 
show good will—if it wants gas to flow 
through to Europe. So what is Putin’s 
definition of ‘‘good will’’ exactly? For 
the people of Ukraine to cease defend-
ing their sovereignty? Such bellicose 
statements tell us that Putin is con-
fident; he is emboldened. Does anyone 
really believe that Putin would not cut 
off gas flow through Ukraine once Nord 
Stream is complete? The United States 
cannot accept this insidious behavior. 
We need a real strategy with respect to 
Nord Stream. 
In Syria, Russia continues to aid and 
abet the brutal and criminal Assad re-
gime only to secure its own interests; 
namely, military access to the Medi-
terranean through which it can threat-
en Europe’s southern flank. Indeed, 
last year the United Nations accused 
Russia itself of war crimes in Syria for 
multiple incidents of launching indis-
criminate attacks on civilian areas. In 
3 years alone, the Syrian Observatory 
for Human Rights estimated that Rus-
sian military activities in Syria caused 
nearly 18,000 casualties, including 8,000 
civilians. 
Let me be clear. These are war 
crimes, and there must be account-
ability. Even as President Biden looks 
for limited ways to cooperate with 
Russia in Syria to try to promote some 
stability and humanitarian access, he 
must not overlook this grim track 
record and seek to hold Putin to ac-
count. The world is watching whether 
the United States will stand up for the 
vulnerable and the voiceless. 
Let me now turn to the ongoing and 
tragic repression of the Russian people. 
Earlier this year, the world drew inspi-
ration from the courage of Russian pro-
testers who rallied in support of Alexei 
Navalny and a democratic future. We 
know that it will be the people of Rus-
sia, not the United States or anyone 
else, who will steer their struggle for 
democracy and ultimately determine 
their own destiny. Yet, as Americans, 
we must stand in solidarity with the 
Russian people. 
I applaud President Biden’s commit-
ment to make democracy and human 
rights the centerpiece of U.S. foreign 
policy, but what does that mean for 
our approach to Russia? First, we must 
respond to egregious chemical weapons 
attacks whenever and however they 
take place. The Chemical and Biologi-
cal Weapons Act required the adminis-
tration to announce a new round of

sanctions by June 2 in response to Rus-
sia’s chemical weapons attack and poi-
soning of Alexei Navalny. This deadline 
has passed. 
The Trump administration regularly 
missed congressionally mandated dead-
lines. I think back to the Skripal at-
tack and how President Trump delayed 
a decision for months. However, I ex-
pect better from this administration. 
President Biden and his team must an-
nounce these sanctions this week, for 
Putin has shown no remorse for these 
vile actions, and Russia has taken no 
steps to rectify them. 
A democracy- and human rights-cen-
tered foreign policy also means coun-
tering corruption, so I welcome the 
White House initiative announced last 
week. Since January, we have seen the 
President back up this commitment by 
imposing sanctions on corrupt actors 
from Bulgaria, to Albania, to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
But, moving forward, we must do more 
to focus this tool on Russia, the pri-
mary source of so much of the corrup-
tion we see around the world. 
The 
most 
effective 
sanction 
on 
Putin’s inner circle of oligarchs is to 
deny them and their families access to 
the West. We must cut off their ability 
to travel and use the Western financial 
system to funnel the assets they sys-
tematically have stolen from the Rus-
sian people over the course of several 
decades. 
Alexei Navalny and others, like the 
Organized Crime and Corruption Re-
porting Project, have done excellent 
work exposing Putin and his cronies. 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury 
and the European Union should evalu-
ate their research and chart a course 
for action. 
We must also directly engage with 
the Russian people and make clear that 
our problems are not with them but 
their government. I urge President 
Biden to make a direct appeal to the 
Russian people over YouTube, commu-
nicate our views and concerns to the 
Russian people, and provide his vision 
for what a positive U.S.-Russia rela-
tionship could look like. The United 
States should also increase exchange 
programs with Russia, assuming the 
Russian Government would allow its 
people to participate. 
Unfortunately, 
everyday Russians’ 
access to fact-based information and 
reporting is dwindling in the face of 
Kremlin crackdowns on journalism and 
pervasive propaganda. I am especially 
outraged by the Russian Government’s 
decision to label Radio Free Europe/ 
Radio Liberty in Russia as a foreign 
agent, subject to fines and to being 
kicked out of the country, all for sup-
porting Russian journalists who report 
on the truth—a commodity in short 
supply in Russia these days. These ac-
tions are disgraceful. And it is worth 
noting that, as legitimate news sources 
like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 
come under fire in Russia, Kremlin 
propaganda arms like RT and Sputnik 
continue to operate freely here in the 
United States. We allow them to freely 
operate, but they are Russia state- 
sponsored enterprises. Perhaps it is 
time we reconsider how easily the 
Kremlin 
can 
disseminate 
disinformation to the American people. 
Meanwhile, several Americans re-
main unjustly detained in Russia, in-
cluding Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. 
The Kremlin’s Kafka-esque treatment 
of American citizens must stop, and 
President Biden should make their re-
turn a priority of the visit. 
Finally, our Embassy presence in 
Moscow faces increasing, growing pres-
sure from the Russian authorities as 
they seek to restrict visas for Embassy 
staff. This has to stop. In my view, if 
Russian diplomats’ visas expire here in 
the United States, then they must 
leave. Extensions should only be grant-
ed when we see reciprocity on the Rus-
sian side. No more games. We have tol-
erated Kremlin abuse of this process 
for too long, and it has to stop. 
In the short time I have stood on this 
floor today, I have provided but a 
glimpse of some of the most chal-
lenging issues facing the U.S.-Russia 
relationship, most of which were ig-
nored by the previous administration. 
President Biden has to correct course 
and forcefully press these matters in 
Geneva. However, there is one area 
that demands real negotiation with 
Moscow: the issue of arms control. 
I supported the extension of the New 
START treaty. It advances U.S. inter-
ests, constrains Russia’s strategic nu-
clear forces, requires stringent verifi-
cation to ensure Russia meets its com-
mitments, and affords us the flexibility 
needed to maintain a safe, secure, mod-
ern, and effective nuclear deterrent. 
The question is, With New START 
extended, where do we go from here? I 
agree with President Biden that estab-
lishing a strategic stability dialogue 
with a country capable of destroying 
the United States is essential. 
Russia continues to pursue new de-
stabilizing nuclear systems and ac-
tively threaten our allies with shorter 
range nuclear weapons. However, we 
cannot 
view 
this 
challenge 
solely 
through a military lens. Diplomacy 
must lead our efforts to reduce nuclear 
tensions going forward, and this sum-
mit would be a good place to start. 
Last week, in the Washington Post, 
former Ambassador to Russia Mike 
McFaul wrote that the Biden adminis-
tration ‘‘cannot freeze U.S.-Russia re-
lations in place to focus on the greater 
challenge of China.’’ 
I believe he is right. Addressing one 
challenge cannot come at the expense 
of other critical U.S. interests. 
Whether we like it or not, the Krem-
lin clearly sees the United States as its 
primary adversary and remains intent 
on challenging us at every turn. Past 
administrations have tried to ignore or 
minimize the threat. It doesn’t work. 
We need an assertive and comprehen-
sive strategy, one that holds the Krem-
lin accountable and even puts them on 
their heels from time to time. 
The United States of America always 
aspires to have a stable, predictable re-
lationship with every country around 
the world. But stable and predictable 
partners do not use chemical weapons 
to wipe out their political opposition. 
Stable and political partners do not 
tear chunks of territory from their 
neighbors. Stable and political part-
ners don’t commit war crimes in places 
like Syria. Vladimir Putin has been 
President for 20 years now. After all 
this time, we know what we are dealing 
with; it is not a stable and predictable 
partner. We are dealing with a mafia 
state run by a vicious authoritarian 
and 
his 
inner 
circle 
of 
corrupt 
oligarchs, not a normal country. We 
are dealing with a criminal enterprise, 
not a democratic government. And as 
President Biden knows, and has said, 
when it comes to Putin, we are dealing 
with a ruthless killer. We should act 
accordingly. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, you 
might have missed it, but without 
much fanfare, the White House quietly 
released the President’s budget on the 
Friday 
before 
a 
holiday 
weekend. 
Maybe we weren’t supposed to notice 
the plan at all, but the contents make 
it impossible to ignore. 
President Biden is proposing higher 
taxes on working Americans and cuts 
to our national defense to pay for a 
massive expansion of the Federal Gov-
ernment, an enactment of the radical 
progressive demands, like parts of the 
Green New Deal. 
What can’t be paid for is simply put 
on the Nation’s ‘‘credit card,’’ adding 
trillions of dollars of red ink. President 
Biden’s budget can be summed up like 
this: higher taxes, higher spending, and 
higher debt. 
And don’t take my word for it. The 
New York Times wrote that Biden’s $6 
trillion budget would ‘‘push federal 
spending to its highest sustained levels 
since World War II.’’ 
Under the Biden budget, by 2028, 
Washington will collect more tax rev-
enue as a portion of our economy than 
at nearly any point over the last 100 
years. This tax-collecting scheme even 
includes a retroactive tax increase. 
That is right, folks, you may owe high-
er taxes on past earnings. 
Plus, the President would allow the 
tax cuts for lower income and middle- 
class Americans to expire in 2025, and 
the result will be higher taxes for most 
Americans. Higher tax bills will add 
additional burdens to Iowa families and 
small businesses already struggling 
with the rising prices and inflation 
being caused by Bidenomics. 
So what do you get in exchange for 
all of these new taxes? For the first 
time in nearly half a century, tax-
payers would be forced to pay for abor-
tions. The Biden budget contains $600 
million for electric vehicles. That is a 
lot of money to subsidize a product

June 9, 2021 
very few Americans, other than upper 
income individuals on the coasts, seem 
interested in purchasing. 
President Biden would also spend 
your taxes to double the size of the IRS 
over the next decade, adding almost 
87,000 new employees at a cost of near-
ly $80 billion. You heard it right, 
folks—87,000 new IRS agents. 
But while the Biden budget promises 
a bureaucratic buildup at the IRS, his 
proposal is far less generous to our 
Armed Forces. The Air Force would 
suffer a substantial cut in its number 
of aircraft. The small number of new 
ships added to the Navy will not keep 
pace with the growth of Communist 
China’s shipbuilding. This is especially 
concerning since the CCP now boasts 
the world’s largest Navy and is at-
tempting to expand its naval presence 
in the Atlantic. You heard that right— 
not the Pacific but into the Atlantic. 
The Army budget would be slashed 
by more than $3 billion. The resulting 
troop reductions would leave us with 
the same sized Army we had on 9/11. 
While 
essentially 
freezing 
defense 
spending overall, $617 million of the 
military’s budget would be diverted to 
fighting climate change. 
Folks, who does the President think 
he will be able to call on should we 
need to fight off foreign threats—his 
new Army of IRS agents? 
We face new threats around the 
globe, and lowering our defenses, as 
President Biden is proposing, will only 
embolden our adversaries. Americans 
may fear an IRS audit, but Red China 
won’t. 
When America last spent as much as 
President Biden is proposing, we built, 
essentially from scratch, the world’s 
greatest military force. And all Ameri-
cans were called on to play their part 
in the most noble of causes. 
The entire free world will forever owe 
a debt of gratitude to the ‘‘greatest 
generation.’’ There is no denying that 
the sacrifices made by these Americans 
and the resources committed to their 
mission forever altered human history 
for the better. The same cannot be said 
about what is now being proposed, 
which leaves America weaker in the 
world, and the debt will be paid by fu-
ture generations. 
The Biden budget is a bust for tax-
payers and a boon for DC bureaucrats 
and tax collectors. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as my colleague from Iowa just said, 
something mysterious happened just 
before the holiday weekend when the 
budget was released. So just before Me-
morial Day, the administration re-
leased its long-awaited fiscal year 2022 
budget proposal. 
Having reviewed the proposal, it is 
obvious why they chose this timing to 
do it—because they hoped most Ameri-
cans would be too distracted by their 
backyard barbecues and tributes to 
fallen heroes to even notice how out-
landish this budget proposal is. Thank 
God, Presidents only propose, Congress 
disposes because we have the power of 
the purse. 
I have bad news for my Democratic 
colleagues about the release of this; 
that the American public won’t have 
the wool pulled over their eyes as eas-
ily as this administration thinks so by 
putting this out late Friday before the 
holiday weekend. Americans will see 
this budget for what it is, a very 
unserious 
political 
document 
con-
taining a laundry list of liberal wish 
list policies unmoored from economic 
or fiscal reality. It would be funny if 
not for the very serious issues we cur-
rently face in our country, and this 
budget makes them worse. 
In response to the pandemic, Con-
gress understandably took bold actions 
to help individuals keep the roof over 
their head and to help small businesses 
keep their lights on. As a result, our 
national debt exploded because of the 
pandemic. It now exceeds the entire 
output of our economy, and this budget 
is going to make that situation even 
worse. 
As we enter the postpandemic world, 
we need to address the very real issues 
about rising debt and deficits posing 
for our country over the long term. 
Otherwise, to quote the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘a grow-
ing debt burden could increase the risk 
of a fiscal crisis and higher inflation as 
well as undermine confidence in the 
U.S. dollar.’’ 
The President’s budget completely 
ignores potential fiscal and economic 
challenges that we all know are on the 
horizon. Taking the concept of ‘‘never 
letting a crisis go to waste’’ to a whole 
new level, the Biden budget would put 
our country in a permanent crisis mode 
in terms of spending and debt levels. 
In 2009, at the height of the financial 
crisis, the government spending peaked 
at 24.4 percent of GDP. Now, spending 
proposed under President Biden’s budg-
et would average even higher at 24.5 
percent over the next decade. So what 
we had peaked in the 2009 year of the 
financial crisis is going to be just com-
mon for the whole next decade, and 
that is bad. 
Moreover, 
the 
President’s 
budget 
would set a new record for the debt as 
a share of the economy. According to 
the President’s own rosy assumptions, 
debt as a percentage of GDP would 
reach 112 percent next year, shattering 
the World War II record of 106 percent 
of GDP. And by 2031, debt as a share of 
our economy would hit 117 percent of 
GDP. So how extraordinary a step this 
budget takes. At a time when inflation 
has been rearing its head, proposing 
sustained spending and debt at these 
levels is playing with fire, like pouring 
gasoline on a fire. 
Even long-term Democrat economists 
and 
Obama 
administration 
alums, 
Larry Summer and Jason Furman, 
have begun to sound the inflation 
alarm. The President would be well-ad-
vised to start taking notice when lead-
ing economists like these two point to 
the dangers of inflation. 
As problematic as the spending side 
of the budget is—and so far that is the 
only part I have covered—we now go to 
the tax side, and the tax side is equally 
dangerous. The President proposes en-
acting the largest tax increase in his-
tory. 
Incredibly, even with the $3.6 trillion 
in new taxes he proposes, his budget 
still doesn’t come close to putting our 
national debt on a sustainable path 
given the new spending. This shows his 
tax cuts aren’t about fiscal responsi-
bility. Instead, they are about pun-
ishing 
success 
and 
redistributing 
wealth. 
Ultimately, this will prove disastrous 
for the economy and, of course, it is 
going to affect all Americans. Job-kill-
ing tax hikes will slow economic 
growth. These tax hikes will reduce 
business investment, and these tax 
hikes will result in lower wages and 
fewer jobs over the long run. As a re-
sult, then, the middle class is likely to 
suffer the most. 
Higher taxes, excessive spending, and 
escalating debt are not a recipe for our 
economy to ‘‘Build Back Better,’’ those 
famous words of this President’s eco-
nomic program—‘‘Build Back Better.’’ 
Instead, they are just a recipe for gov-
ernment to ‘‘Build Bureaucracy Bet-
ter’’ and at the expense of hard-work-
ing Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here to join my colleague from 
Iowa who just spoke and others to talk 
about the President’s budget. 
The budget is comprised of a couple 
of things. One is what the spending is 
going to be for the country. The spend-
ing, which is unbelievably high and at 
unprecedented levels of spending at a 
time of unprecedented deficits and a 
long-term debt that is at the highest 
level ever, is concerning. 
The second is that the budget is 
about revenue. So on the spending side, 
we all expected it to be a very high 
number—over $6 trillion in new spend-
ing—but on the tax side, we also have 
huge new tax increases. The Senator 
from Iowa just said it is the largest tax 
increase in the history of the country. 
He is the former chairman of the tax- 
writing committee, chairman of the 
Budget Committee here, and he has 
been through a lot of tax increases over 
the years. This is the largest one in the 
history of the country. It is coming at 
a time when you don’t want to raise 
taxes because we are coming out of this 
pandemic, trying to get the economy 
back on track. 
One reason that we were in good 
shape before COVID–19 is because we 
actually put in place some tax reforms 
and some tax cuts that really worked. 
Let’s be very specific about that. In the 
months just before COVID–19 hit, we 
had an economy that was hitting on all 
cylinders in every respect.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4009 
June 9, 2021 
In February of that year—so Feb-
ruary before the COVID–19 crisis hit— 
we had the 19th straight month of wage 
growth of over 3 percent. That was 
great news in my home State of Ohio, 
I will tell you, because we had years of 
flat-rate 
growth, 
even 
declining 
growth, when you take into account 
the effects of inflation. So we had real-
ly nice wage growth. 
And guess who was made the bene-
ficiary of that wage growth. It was 
lower 
and 
middle-income 
workers, 
which is also something you would all 
think people would hope for in this 
Chamber. That was partly because the 
tax cuts the government put in place in 
2018 from the 2017 Republican bill pro-
vided tax relief to middle-class fami-
lies, doubled the standard deduction, 
doubled the child tax credit, lowered 
the tax rates, and put more money into 
people’s pockets. And the 2017 reforms 
also spurred needed investment in our 
communities, growing economic oppor-
tunities, particularly in low-income 
neighborhoods. 
And the reforms on the corporate 
side—on the international side and on 
the corporate side—generally meant 
that more companies were investing in 
America, creating more jobs and in-
vestments here rather than overseas. 
At the time, the Congressional Budg-
et Office did an analysis of the lower 
corporate rate, as an example, and said 
that 70 percent of that benefit was 
going to go to workers in terms of 
their wages and salaries. That is ex-
actly what we saw. So, again, there 
were 19 straight months of wage 
growth of over 3 percent in February 
before COVID hit. 
By the way, also in that time pe-
riod—the year before COVID hit—we 
had the lowest poverty rate in the his-
tory of the country. Let me repeat that 
because I think it would be a surprise 
for a lot of people to hear this who are 
so critical of the tax reforms in 2017 on 
the other side of the aisle, saying this 
is not going to help ordinary people. Of 
course, it did. 
We talked about the wage growth, 
but also the lowest poverty rate in the 
history of our country. We also saw a 
50-year low in unemployment. We saw 
record low unemployment among cer-
tain groups of Americans, including 
Hispanics, Blacks, and Asian Ameri-
cans. 
We also saw a situation where there 
were a lot of jobs being created that 
were higher wage jobs because wages 
were going up, and we had the kind of 
opportunity economy that everybody 
in this Chamber should hope for. 
What is this budget saying? This is 
the budget, again, that President Biden 
has just put out. He has said: Let’s get 
rid of all that tax reform and those tax 
cuts. Virtually, every one of the 2017 
tax cuts expires under his budget or is 
ended now before it would normally ex-
pire. Let me repeat that: The budget 
that they put out wants to increase 
taxes, and that includes taxes on ev-
erybody, including the middle class. In 
only a few months in office, the Biden 
Administration is committed to spend-
ing about $6 trillion. 
Again, just put this in context. That 
is bigger than the annual budget of the 
United States. When you add up all the 
plans the President has put out there, 
it is $6 trillion in new spending. One of 
the problems with that has been that it 
has primed the pump. In other words, 
it put so much stimulus into the econ-
omy that it has created inflation. That 
was something that was warned by Re-
publicans, including me and others, but 
also Democrats, like Larry Summers, 
who is a Democrat, an economist, and 
former Secretary of the Treasury. 
Unfortunately, it looks like that pre-
diction was correct because inflation is 
up. If you ask folks back home about 
it, they will say: Yeah, I went to the 
gas pump, and it was $3.50 a gallon. 
That is what I heard last weekend. 
That is what I experienced myself. 
Also, it is the price of food. 
Certainly, it is the price of materials. 
If you are trying to build something 
today and you want to buy some ply-
wood, good luck. The costs have sky-
rocketed. 
This inflation is real and it is hap-
pening, and people are feeling it. In a 
way, that is a hidden tax, isn’t it? If ev-
erything costs more, it is sort of a re-
gressive tax that is built into the sys-
tem. That is what is happening when 
we have inflation. We are also seeing 
pressure on interest rates, of course, 
which is going to make it harder on 
people to buy a home, buy a car, to be 
able to get by. 
This $6 trillion has made a difference 
in the sense of sending a message out 
from the Democrats that we would like 
to spend much more, but they already 
did spend quite a bit that has primed 
the pump—$1.4 trillion in a COVID 
package, as an example. 
By the way, that $6 trillion, when 
you add it up, is about six times more 
than the government spent in response 
to the Great Depression. That is ad-
justed for inflation. I am talking about 
inflation-adjusted terms. It is about six 
times more than the government spent 
in the 1930s in the Great Depression. 
It is a very radical budget, really, 
both on the spending side and on the 
tax side. The philosophy of more and 
more spending at a time of record debt 
and record deficits isn’t going to help 
our economy recover. I think it is sim-
ply going to drive inflation, as we 
talked about, put pressure on interest 
rates, keep people out of jobs, and put 
more financial pressure on everyday 
Americans. 
Instead, what we ought to do is help 
people get back to work. COVID–19, 
thank God, is finally passing. In my 
own State of Ohio, we are finally open-
ing up again because our COVID–19 
rates are so low. The vaccines are 
working. 
I 
encourage 
people 
who 
haven’t been vaccinated to step for-
ward and do it because it helps you and 
your family and also our communities 
to be able to recover more quickly—get 
people back to work and back to 
school, get our children back to school 
and get back to our churches and our 
synagogues, and get back to our nor-
mal life. It is starting to happen, and it 
is exciting. 
One of the problems is, again, higher 
inflation, higher interest rates, and 
also that there just aren’t adequate 
workers out there, in part, because the 
government is paying more and more 
for unemployment insurance—$300 in 
Federal supplement on top of the nor-
mal unemployment in the States. 
There are still 25 States that have 
that, and this means that people often 
are making more on unemployment 
than they would be making at work. 
On average, about 42 percent of people, 
with the additional $300, are making 
more on unemployment than they were 
at work. That creates a little disincen-
tive. 
There are other disincentives, too, 
out there to go back to work. As a re-
sult, there are 9.3 million jobs open in 
America. That is the latest figure from 
the Department of Labor based on the 
April numbers. We don’t have the May 
numbers yet, but 9.3 million is a record 
number of job openings in America. We 
never had this many jobs open. 
This is a problem because if you 
don’t get people back to work and fill-
ing these jobs, some of these companies 
are going to downsize. Some will leave 
our shores for elsewhere, where they 
can find workers. Others, frankly, are 
automating. You could argue that may 
be a more efficient, economic decision, 
but I don’t like to see that. I don’t like 
to see that. I think the technology and 
the automation, where appropriate, are 
great, but I want to see people get jobs 
where they get the dignity and self-re-
spect that comes from working, and 
they get the opportunity to have a ful-
filling life with work. 
So 9.3 million jobs are open. Let’s fill 
those jobs. Let’s not do this incredibly 
high spending level talked about in 
this budget. Let’s not raise these taxes 
at a time when we are finally seeing 
economies 
start 
to 
rebound 
after 
COVID–19. Let’s get back on track. We 
had a great economy—an opportunity 
economy—before COVID–19. That is 
what we want to return to. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I 
come here, probably more than any 
other Senator, on this topic of budgets, 
and it ought to be called the ‘‘lack of 
budgets.’’ 
Thank goodness that, currently, we 
have the blueprint out there in black 
and white for what we intend to do—for 
what the President intends to do, and 
he is going to try to sell it to the 
American public. 
We have been on this pathway for 
decades. During the Reagan years, we 
talked about enlivening the economy, 
bringing taxes down, letting people 
keep more of their own resources. That 
worked. I think that still makes sense.

It works in most States. It was driving 
the economy with that dynamic pre- 
COVID. 
But what we did lose along the way is 
that—regardless of our revenues, which 
stubbornly average 17 to 18 percent of 
our GPD—when you raise rates, people 
don’t produce as much. There is not as 
much income to tax. When you lower 
them, you get more revenue to tax, and 
you actually are gaining more revenue 
for the government, to boot. So we 
were there pre-COVID. We only need to 
look to see what was working just 11⁄2 
or 2 years ago. It was the best the econ-
omy was doing. 
It was raising wages. We always 
should be interested in doing that but 
not through government—through the 
productive private economy. It was 
raising it in places that we had never 
been able to do it before. So rather 
than throw that blueprint out the door 
and go with something like this that 
has never worked in the past, whenever 
you get government becoming that 
large a part of your economy—and it 
used to be 20 percent. Even though we 
were only taking in 17 to 18 percent, re-
gardless of the tax rates in our own 
government revenue, we got used to 
running deficits. That is what hap-
pened decades ago, and we have all got-
ten used to it. If you want to see a 
budget that takes the theory that it 
doesn’t make any difference how much 
more you spend than you take in, this 
is it. If you like it, it is the best budget 
we have ever done. 
Again, we shouldn’t be calling it a 
budget because budgets mean that you 
live within your means from year to 
year like all other entities do. State 
governments do it and some that don’t 
generally have issues in their own 
States’ economies, but we cannot take 
all of these resources from the private 
sector, run them through government 
with the inefficiency that goes along 
with that, and expect to have a good 
outcome. 
Senator GRASSLEY was here earlier 
and Senator PORTMAN. They gave you a 
bunch of statistics. I am going to de-
scribe how this shipwreck ends up on 
the shore over time. It is just a ques-
tion of how much we buy into this as 
the way we need to run our govern-
ment, which has not worked over the 
last two decades—from the Gulf wars 
and from all of the stuff that we have 
tried to do through government for 
which we used to at least have pay- 
fors. 
The biggest drivers of our current 
deficits nobody wants to talk about. 
They are Medicare and Social Security. 
We knew decades ago that the Social 
Security trust fund was going to go 
bust and that it is going to happen here 
in a little over a decade. Will we do 
anything to try to change it? That 
takes political will. I have been here a 
little under 21⁄2
years and have not 
found a lot of that. 
The bigger driver of our structural 
deficits would be a broken healthcare 
system. I, more than any other Sen-
ator, have talked about that—not solv-
ing it through more government but 
reforming healthcare to make it be-
come a true industry that believes in 
transparency, competition, and getting 
the healthcare consumer involved. We 
can fix that part of it, but we can’t get 
any interest even in my own party for 
much of that because we defend a bro-
ken healthcare industry. We don’t ask 
it to be transparent, competitive, and 
engage the consumer like most other 
industries do and do well and that pro-
vide a good service to the American 
consumer. 
So government will end up doing 
what it always does. It is so easy to 
borrow from others and to spend the 
money. You are going to have a sugar 
high. You are going to feel good, but 
there is going to be indigestion down 
the road. The way it is going to end up 
is we are going to have calamities 
within our credit markets, and we are 
going to have people no longer willing 
to lend us money. 
We have now taken these trillion-dol-
lar deficits, which are going to be clos-
er to $1.5 trillion, and this new budg-
et—again, I hate even calling it a budg-
et—is going to add to that, not lessen 
it. When you talk about raising reve-
nues, there is even anxiety on the 
other side of the aisle because raising 
taxes never goes well. It is generally 
tough to get everybody to agree on it, 
and that means our deficits are going 
to be even larger. 
Is it going to take our completely de-
pleting the Social Security trust fund 
that we have been paying into since 
the thirties, and is it going to take de-
pleting the Medicare trust fund, which 
now happens in 51⁄2 years, and is the 
American public going to allow us here 
to keep spending more money than we 
take in year after year and end up 
where the Chinese won’t lend us any 
money down the road? Others won’t as 
well because our interest is going to be 
about as much as we pay for defense, 
and then you are going to have a ca-
lamity. 
You can blame it on everyone here 
who thinks this feels good now. When 
you want to feel good in the future, 
you 
make 
hard 
decisions 
in 
the 
present. Any well-run organization or 
any well-run State or local government 
makes those tough decisions in the 
short run so they don’t have to solve 
things through a calamity in the long 
run. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to talk about our 
economy and link that to the budget 
that the President has introduced for 
our Nation going forward. 
On Friday, the Department of Labor 
published its monthly jobs report. Just 
like the April jobs report, the May re-
port is a cause for concern. There real-
ly wasn’t any cause for celebration. 
Yet President Biden did exactly the 
same thing that he did in the previous 
month after that disappointing jobs re-
port—he declared victory. He gave a 
speech in Delaware, and he called it 
‘‘historic progress.’’ Even the President 
of the United States is stretching the 
language of our Nation right here. 
Let’s look at the facts. 
What is Joe Biden calling ‘‘historic 
progress’’? 
Over the last 2 months, about 850,000 
fewer people were hired than the econo-
mists had predicted. In the month of 
May alone, 160,000 people left the labor 
force. The percentage of Americans in 
the labor force actually went down. 
Another month, another weak jobs re-
port. It is disappointing but not sur-
prising. We know why it has slowed 
down. President Biden and the Demo-
crats have committed to paying mil-
lions of people more to stay home from 
work than to go to work. If you pay 
people more to not work than to work, 
that is what you are going to get. That 
is what they are being encouraged to 
do. In fact, I would say that these peo-
ple are not being lazy; they are being 
logical with the incentives that the 
Democrats have put in front of them, 
which is money in their pockets to 
stay home from work. 
There are 9.3 million jobs that are 
unfilled right now in the United States, 
a record high. As a result, small busi-
nesses—and I heard about it this week-
end in Wyoming—are struggling to find 
people to work there. They are having 
a hard time finding people to take jobs. 
They have signs up: ‘‘Help Wanted.’’ 
‘‘We Need You.’’ ‘‘Offering Incentives.’’ 
If people are getting paid more to not 
work than to work, that is what they 
are going to do. 
At the same time, prices continue to 
rise. That is what I heard about as I 
was sitting, waiting to have my oil 
changed. It was a longer line than 
usual in Casper, not because we didn’t 
have good workers but because we 
didn’t have enough of them in a place 
that changed oil that had two bays set 
up but was down to one. They have to 
do that several days a week because 
they don’t have the workforce. They 
can’t find the people to change the oil. 
So it was a good townhall meeting as 
we sat around there, waiting for our oil 
to be changed, talking to people about 
their concerns. That is what we heard 
about: trouble finding workers, infla-
tion. 
Last week, the White House Press 
Secretary was asked about high gas 
prices—and I had heard about that in 
Wyoming as we were sitting around, 
waiting to get the oil changed: You 
know, it costs about $15 or $20 more to 
fill a tank than it did a year ago. Peo-
ple not only pay attention to how 
many dollars and cents it costs for a 
gallon of gas but how much it costs to 
fill the tank and how much less they 
have to spend for other things. 
The White House Press Secretary 
said that gas prices aren’t very high if 
you account for inflation. 
If you account for inflation? It is in-
flation. Gas prices are high because it

is what happens when prices go up. 
That is inflation. 
This should be a news flash for Amer-
ica. Inflation is the problem. The White 
House Press Secretary didn’t seem to 
see the connection. It is caused by this 
administration. Gas prices have gone 
up about 70 cents a gallon in the last 4 
months—since Joe Biden took the oath 
of office. It is no surprise when the 
President, on the day he takes the oath 
of office, paints a target on the back of 
American energy and pulls the trigger, 
which makes us more dependent on for-
eign sources of energy. 
As the senior Senator from Alaska 
said in an Energy Committee hearing, 
we are, at this time in the United 
States, using more energy from Russia 
than we are from her home State of 
Alaska. That is a comment on the poli-
cies of this administration. 
Summer is almost here, and the pan-
demic is almost over. What is going to 
happen with regard to the demand for 
gasoline? It is going to continue to go 
up. 
There is a moratorium on the explo-
ration of oil and gas in the United 
States, and we are making ourselves 
more dependent on foreign sources. 
What is the President doing? Imposing 
more taxes on American energy. Last 
week, he put more restrictions on the 
production of energy from Alaska. Now 
what does he want to do? Well, we have 
seen it in the Finance Committee right 
here. He wants to impose the increase 
of taxes on oil and gas producers. That 
is going to hurt the people who work in 
that industry, and it is going to make 
all of us pay more at the tank. This is 
basic economics. If you restrict the 
production of American oil and gas and 
if you raise the taxes on oil and gas, 
the prices people have to pay at the 
pump—the prices they pay to fill up 
their vehicles—are going to go up. 
President Biden keeps declaring vic-
tory and keeps doubling down on poli-
cies that are slowing down the econ-
omy. Two weeks ago, he introduced his 
budget request for next year. To me, it 
is a blueprint for bankruptcy. He is 
proposing $6 trillion in Federal spend-
ing for next year. During the pandemic, 
the country hit about $4 trillion in an-
nual Federal spending for the first time 
ever. This was during a national emer-
gency, and we passed it in a bipartisan 
way with over 90 votes in the Senate. 
In five different coronavirus relief 
bills, we were able to deal with what 
needed to be done for our Nation at the 
time. The pandemic is behind us, and 
the President now wants to spend $2 
trillion more than that every year even 
after the pandemic is over. This is only 
the beginning. 
The Biden budget doesn’t even in-
clude some of the most expensive cam-
paign promises he made when he was 
running for President. According to 
one estimate, the Biden budget is miss-
ing about $1.5 trillion that he had 
promised to spend. It is not even in-
cluded in the budget. What happens 
with all of this additional spending? Of 
course, it is going to cause inflation be-
cause more money will be out there to 
chase the goods and services that are 
available. 
President Biden also wants to bring 
back the death tax. This would be dev-
astating for farmers and ranchers who 
want to keep their farms in their fami-
lies. I heard about it this past weekend 
in Sheridan, WY, with the Wyoming 
Stock Growers Association. As for the 
families who have had the ranches or 
the farms in their families for over 100 
years, we call them centennial families 
in Wyoming, and we celebrate them 
every year. They have all said, if this 
happens—if the Biden administration 
does this with what it wants to do with 
the 
death 
tax—when 
Grandma 
or 
Grandpa passes, every one of them is 
going to have to sell the farm just to 
pay the taxes. They have been able to 
keep them within the families for 100 
years. Joe Biden is going to take the ax 
to them. 
Get this. He wants to hire 87,000 more 
bureaucrats at the Internal Revenue 
Service. The Internal Revenue Service 
is the least accountable and most pow-
erful Agency in the Federal Govern-
ment. The Biden goal is to collect $700 
billion more from taxpayers. What does 
he want to do with the money? Use it 
for additional socialist spending. We 
have seen the list. Under the Biden 
agenda, working families are going to 
be paying more at the pump, more at 
the grocery store, and they are going 
to end up paying more as well through 
taxes. They are seeing it now. Our jobs 
reports, our inflation reports, our gas 
prices have all been disappointing to 
all Americans. 
This is a direct result of the policies 
that are coming out of this administra-
tion and out of this White House. It is 
time for the President to stop the at-
tacks on American energy, to stop pay-
ing people more to not work than to 
work, and to stop this irresponsible 
spending spree as outlined in the budg-
et. 
We know what works. Let’s return to 
the policies that work, to the policies 
that have been giving us the best econ-
omy in a half a century. Just 16 
months ago, we had low taxes, reason-
able regulations, and more American 
energy. The economy was booming 
until the coronavirus hit. We need to 
get back to that again.

249TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ‘‘GASPEE’’ RAID 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-

days of the year on the Senate floor be-
cause today is the 249th anniversary of 
the Gaspee raid. I can only imagine 
what I am going to do next year when 
it is the 250th anniversary of the 
Gaspee raid. I may bring pyrotechnics 
onto the Senate floor, in violation of 
every rule. 
The Gaspee raid is what Rhode Island 
abolitionist and writer Frances Whip-
ple McDougall called the ‘‘first blood’’ 
drawn in America’s struggle for inde-
pendence, and I come every year to 
mark this important but overlooked 
event in American history. 
Our typical history textbook tells us 
that the Boston Tea Party sparked the 
American Revolution in December of 
1773. Remember that date: 1773, Decem-
ber. Massachusetts folks in Boston pro-
tested English taxation by pushing tea 
into Boston Harbor. It was a memo-
rable protest. We ought to remember 
it. But we Rhode Islanders contend 
that a different spark 16 months earlier 
out on Narragansett Bay ignited the 
Revolution. The date was June 9, 1772, 
and the central players in this saga 
were two ships, one a little sloop, the 
Hannah, embarking from Newport for 
Providence, and the other a British 
customs schooner, the HMS Gaspee; 
hence the Gaspee raid. The Gaspee was 
under the command of Lieutenant Wil-
liam 
Dudingston 
of 
His 
Majesty’s 
Royal Navy, patrolling Narragansett 
Bay. 
The meeting of the Hannah and the 
Gaspee and the act of defiance that fol-
lowed would be explosive. 
Before I describe the encounter of the 
Hannah and the Gaspee, it is important 
to set the stage. 
England’s King George had over-
extended his empire during the Seven 
Years War, especially in the war’s 
American theater known as the French 
and Indian War. The conflict was ex-
pensive to win, and by its end, Britain 
had taken on vast new territory and 
the cost of governing that territory, 
and the British national debt soon dou-
bled. 
Meanwhile, over the course of the 
18th century, Rhode Island had become 
a prosperous, major distiller and dis-
tributor of rum and trader of goods. 
Now, the rum trade was a corrupt and 
immoral enterprise, a leg of which 
profited off the labor of enslaved Afri-
cans, but it was profitable, and the 
British were thirsty for customs du-
ties. So the Crown tried to crack down 
on Rhode Island’s trade, including its 
rum-running, to collect more customs 
revenue to pay down the King’s debts. 
King George’s zeal for tax collecting 
in Narragansett Bay got a little out of 
hand. British officers started seizing 
cargo without evidence, leaving the 
cargo’s owners with no recourse. They 
commandeered Rhode Islanders’ ships 
on flimsy grounds and then used those 
commandeered ships to collect more 
customs 
duties. 
British 
authorities 
even pressed Colonial sailors into serv-
ice, essentially kidnapping them and 
forcing them to work on the ships of 
the Crown.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4012 
June 9, 2021 
In one incident in July 1764, the cus-
toms ship HMS St. John seized cargo 
and a brig in Newport Harbor. Rhode 
Islanders deemed this outright theft. 
The Governor, Stephen Hopkins, later 
a signer of the Declaration of Independ-
ence, ordered the arming of a sloop to 
go out and take on the St. John in open 
battle on the bay. 
The British got wind of it, and they 
reinforced the St. John with the power-
fully armed, if meekly named, HMS 
Squirrel. 
So 
the 
Rhode 
Islanders 
scrapped their plans for a naval battle 
and settled for firing on the St. John 
from fortifications on Goat Island with 
13-pounder canons. 
When the HMS Maidstone impressed 
into servitude an entire crew of colo-
nists, Rhode Islanders carried one of 
Maidstone’s boats that they were able 
to seize from Newport Harbor to the 
city commons and burned it, with hun-
dreds of onlookers cheering. 
The Royal Navy impounded promi-
nent merchant John Hancock’s sloop, 
the Liberty, in 1768. Even after the 
charges of illegal wine importation 
that had justified the seizure sup-
posedly were dropped, the British Navy 
kept his ship and used it for themselves 
for more customs enforcement. The 
next year, colonists in Newport re-
claimed the Liberty by force. 
These 
simmering 
maritime 
hos-
tilities set the backdrop for the fateful 
meeting of the Hannah and the Gaspee 
in 1772. 
As the Hannah sailed north up the 
bay on June 9, the Gaspee intercepted 
her and ordered the crew to stop for a 
search. The Hannah’s captain, Ben-
jamin Lindsey, was having none of it, 
and he did not comply. He held his 
course and continued sailing north to-
ward Providence. 
Warning shots were fired from the 
Gaspee. Despite them, Lindsey contin-
ued on. His smaller and more maneu-
verable vessel led the bigger Gaspee up 
north toward Namquid Point. Well, the 
waters off Namquid Point shoal, and 
there are shallows off Namquid Point. 
Lindsey, as an experienced navigator 
and sailor in Narragansett Bay, knew 
this, and he sailed his Hannah over the 
shallows and kept on up to Providence. 
Behind them, the angry Gaspee came 
surging in chase and ground into the 
sand and stuck. 
Aground off Pawtuxet Cove, the 
Gaspee would need to wait for the next 
high tide before it could float free. 
Night closed in on the Gaspee. There 
was no Moon. Lieutenant Dudingston 
and his crew were left to wait in dark-
ness and exposed. 
Captain Lindsey sailed the Hannah 
on up to Providence, and up in Provi-
dence, he immediately arranged a 
meeting of local patriots in a tavern 
called Sabin’s Tavern, which still ex-
ists under another name today, in what 
is now the East Side of Providence, 
just below Brown University. Together, 
and no doubt after refreshments, the 
group decided to end the career of the 
Gaspee once and for all. 
Several boatloads of Rhode Islanders, 
led by John Brown—later to have 
Brown University named for him—and 
Abraham Whipple—an ancestor, I be-
lieve, of Ms. Whipple McDougall—dis-
guised 
themselves 
and 
boarded 
longboats in the night and rowed the 6 
miles from Providence down the bay to 
the Gaspee. There, they surrounded the 
boat, and Brown called on Lieutenant 
Dudingston to surrender his ship. 
The lieutenant refused and ordered 
his men to fire on anyone who tried to 
board and warned the Rhode Islanders 
of that threat. Well, the Rhode Island-
ers were having none of that. They 
stormed the Gaspee in the dark, and a 
melee ensued. Shots were fired. Swords 
clashed. In the struggle, Dudingston 
was shot and wounded by a musket 
ball—the first blood there of conflict 
between the Colonies and the Crown; 
the first blood, one could say, of the 
American 
Revolution 
drawn 
right 
there off Pawtuxet Cove. 
The struggle ended with the Rhode 
Islanders in control of the vessel. 
Brown and Whipple’s men ferried the 
British crew safely to shore, sought 
medical 
treatment 
for 
Lieutenant 
Dudingston, and then returned to the 
abandoned Gaspee to make sure it 
never carried a Rhode Islander again. 
To get rid of it for good, they set it on 
fire and retreated from the boat to 
watch it burn and burn until the fire 
reached the powder magazines and, 
when the fire reached the powder mag-
azines, explode into the Narragansett 
Bay night, blowing the remainder of 
the Gaspee to smithereens and leaving 
it all to burn to the waterline. 
Today, we Rhode Islanders call the 
site of these events Gaspee Point. 
Every year in early June, we celebrate 
the spirit of Rhode Island defiance that 
blossomed that day in Narragansett 
Bay 249 years ago. We will walk a pa-
rade in honor of Gaspee Day this week-
end, and we will always remember the 
Gaspee raid, how it preceded by over a 
year the Boston Tea Party, and how, 
while those noble Bostonians pushed 
tea bags off of British ships into Bos-
ton Harbor, we blew the boat up. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB 
SHOOTING 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, nearly 5 years ago, our State, Na-
tion, the city of Orlando, and Hispanic 
and LGBTQ communities were at-
tacked, and 49 innocent and beautiful 
lives were lost. It was an evil act—an 
act of terrorism—designed to divide us 
as a nation and strike fear in our 
hearts and minds but instead we came 
together; we supported each other; and 
we persevered. We proved to the world 
what we in Florida already knew: Flo-
ridians are resilient. 
The days I spent in Orlando following 
the shooting will always be with me. I 
talked to many parents who lost their 
children. I went to funerals and wakes. 
And I sat in hospital rooms. As a father 
and grandfather, it was one of the 
hardest things I have ever had to do. It 
was heartbreaking. 
But in this horribly dark time, the 
selfless courage of so many, from com-
munity members to law enforcement, 
to healthcare workers, provided a sense 
of hope. This incredible strength, love, 
and bravery lifted up Orlando and the 
State of Florida and helped us begin to 
rebuild. 
This week, on the fifth anniversary 
of this unthinkable tragedy, the State 
of Florida comes together to honor the 
lives lost too soon. And we vow to al-
ways stand up and fight against evil 
and hatred in this world. 
Now I yield the floor to my colleague 
from Florida, Senator RUBIO. 
Mr. RUBIO. Most Americans remem-
ber that horrifying day 5 years ago. I 
certainly do. I remember it was a 
morning, and I started getting text 
messages that something horrifying 
had happened in our home State. As we 
turned on the news, we could see that 
it already had been the deadliest at-
tack on American soil since September 
11 of 2001. 
And the full horror of that day, of 
that night, came into focus, as I re-
member jumping in my truck and driv-
ing 3 hours to be on the scene. And it 
would be a few more days, or a few 
more hours, before we learned that it 
was an attack that was inspired by an 
ideology of hatred by an individual in-
spired by—who had pledged allegiance 
to a foreign terrorist organization, and 
in that context appeared there on that 
evening. It was an evening of tragedy. 
It was, as Senator SCOTT mentioned, 
Latin night at the Pulse nightclub. 
This was a well-known nightclub in the 
LGBTQ community in Central Florida. 
And one would think no one should 
ever be—the last thing someone is wor-
ried about when they go out for a night 
with their friends is that they are 
going to be attacked by a radical 
jihadist terrorist in the United States. 
We had seen similar attacks in Lon-
don and France. And the realization 
that that could happen in Florida, just 
down the street from a small business 
furniture store whose owners I had got-
ten to know shook everyone, shook me. 
Like 
most 
terrorist 
attacks, 
it 
sought not only to bring death but di-
vision and fear, to terrorize; and, clear-
ly, there is a tremendous amount of 
pain that 5 years later is still there. 
But from it, what also occurred was 
that it brought Floridians together, 
particularly those in Central Florida— 
first, hand in hand to grieve and then 
to preserve the memory of those whose 
lives were lost. The outpouring of love 
and support came not only from Flor-
ida but from Americans from all across 
the United States who shared in our 
grief and drew inspiration from the 
State’s resilience. 
Five years later, the process of 
mourning continues. The process of re-
membrance continues, but so, too, is 
Orlando as united as it was 5 years ago. 
It is a reminder to us that even with

all the challenges and threats we face, 
the threat of a radical, hateful ideology 
that can inspire people living here to 
take such horrifying actions, is some-
thing we should remain vigilant about. 
And I want to thank my colleague 
Senator SCOTT for allowing me to part-
ner with him on this resolution to re-
member not just that tragic day and to 
support the national Pulse Memorial 
but also to extend our continued con-
dolences to those who suffered so 
greatly on that evening and to remind 
a nation of how we must remain vigi-
lant against those who seek to ter-
rorize. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Florida for participating in this with 
me. It was a devastating day 5 years 
ago for all of us in Florida and around 
the Nation. 
Today, I am requesting all my col-
leagues join us to honor the memory of 
the 49 lives lost and come together to 
say their nation will always stand 
against hate and evil in this world. 
I will be asking consent for the Sen-
ate to pass a resolution honoring the 
memory of the victims of the heinous 
attack of the Pulse nightclub, cospon-
sored by my colleague from Florida, 
Senator RUBIO, and legislation desig-
nating the location of the Pulse night-
club in Orlando as the National Pulse 
Memorial to serve as a tribute to the 
victims and a reminder for us to al-
ways stand for love and kindness over 
hate and evil in this world. It is also 
cosponsored by my colleague from 
Florida, Senator RUBIO, and my col-
league 
from 
California, 
Senator 
PADILLA. I hope my colleagues join us 
in the effort today.

EXECUTIVE SESSION—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, we 
have a tendency in this Chamber to 
talk about hindsight being 20/20, and I 
think that this is what we will be doing 
in 10 or 20 years when we look back on 
the Biden administration. I really ex-
pect that we will highlight all of the 
big talk here in DC that has led to 
some really bad ideas the White House 
has tried to legitimize through legisla-
tion and budget requests. 
If you remember, even before the 2020 
election, Biden’s big talk on amnesty 
welcomed the hundreds of thousands of 
migrants who are currently flooding 
the southern border. He said: We expect 
to see these migrants at the border. 
So, yes, they heard him say, ‘‘Y’all 
come,’’ and they are coming. 
His big talk on Green New Deal pro-
grams got us the boondoggle of an in-
frastructure package that all but ig-
nores roads, bridges, and broadband. 
The people in Memphis, TN, have not 
appreciated some of this talk of other 
items as infrastructure. They want 
bridge repairs immediately. Then, just 
before Memorial Day, we got some 
more big talk in the form of his $6 tril-
lion budget request that reads like an 
instruction manual on how to make 
our country less secure, less free, and 
less competitive. 
Back home in Tennessee, people 
looked at this thing, and they didn’t 
believe what they were seeing. At 
church last Sunday, I had some friends 
ask me if the budget proposal was sup-
posed to be a joke or if this were seri-
ous because, when they look around, 
they see real need. They see commu-
nities without broadband, small busi-
nesses that are struggling to get back 
on their feet, and crumbling roads and 
bridges. 
Yet what did the administration 
choose to do with their first budget? 
They turned away from those needs. 
They decided to throw billions of dol-
lars at the environmental lobby to 
make it happy. They put in money to

abortionists and to an already bloated 
Federal bureaucracy. 
Tennesseans are looking at their own 
budgets and thinking about all of the 
ways they have had to make tough 
choices over the past year, and they 
are wondering why the Biden adminis-
tration cannot seem to bring itself to 
show some fiscal restraint. Why is it 
that they just say: Crank up the print-
ing press. Let’s print more dollars. 
Let’s put more money in the system. 
Let’s give everybody a check—and no 
worries about who is going to pay the 
bill? 
They are used to seeing the Demo-
crats act in a very cavalier manner 
about spending, and they are very 
much concerned about what they see 
happening in Washington, DC. They 
know, without a doubt, that this is 
really going to cost them and that it is 
going to cost their children and their 
grandchildren, and as someone said 
this weekend, it is the great-grand-
children who will bear the brunt of the 
Biden extravaganza. They know better 
than to nod along with the administra-
tion’s promises that only the rich and 
the megacorporations will be respon-
sible for offsetting this massive spend-
ing program. 
I will tell you that they know how 
this works. They have seen it before. 
They know that there are higher taxes 
at the top and that higher taxes at the 
top of this wish list and on the top 
earners will mean less investment in 
their communities, which will lead to 
stagnant economic development, which 
will land them in the exact same place 
that they were during the Obama- 
Biden years, except there will be the 
added expenses of having to comply 
with future mandates the administra-
tion is going to pile on them. 
They know, when you take from the 
people who create the jobs and make 
the investments and provide the goods 
that drive our economy, that you are 
taking from the middle class, that you 
are taking from small businesses on 
every Main Street in this country. You 
are making opening that business too 
expensive to afford because you have 
taken those tax dollars and you are 
using those dollars to grow union mem-
bership, to show favoritism, and to 
pick winners and losers Washington, 
DC, style. 
That is exactly how you destroy that 
competitiveness that makes companies 
want to do business here and to emi-
grate here, and that makes other coun-
tries a little nervous to stand toe to 
toe with us on the international stage. 
This international element is impor-
tant, and I fear the Biden administra-
tion has lost that perspective. 
If you look at the budget items re-
lated to immigration, it is clear that 
the White House still thinks they can 
make it out of this border crisis with-
out having to admit that their policies 
have, indeed, caused this crisis at our 
Nation’s southern border. Yes, indeed, 
this is the Biden border crisis. Instead 
of securing the border by investing in 
the technology, infrastructure, and 
manpower our Border Patrol agents 
have repeatedly asked for, the adminis-
tration wants to focus on sending for-
eign aid to the Northern Triangle, for-
eign aid without accountability. This 
is a noble effort, but it will do nothing 
to mitigate the disaster on the border 
that has since bled into the commu-
nities that are now playing host to bus-
loads of unaccompanied migrant chil-
dren, like we see in Chattanooga. 
At least they decided to invest in a 
few more immigration judges. Yet 
what we see them doing through this is 
making every town a border town and 
every State a border State. They are 
transferring the costs to our States and 
to our local communities—the costs for 
education, for healthcare, for chil-
dren’s services, for social services, for 
housing. 
The 
Federal 
Government 
doesn’t want to admit they are incur-
ring that cost. 
So what are they doing? At taxpayer 
expense, they are putting these over a 
half-a-million illegal entrants onto air-
planes, onto buses, and they are send-
ing them to communities around this 
country. That is what they are doing, 
and that is what millions of Ameri-
cans, 
including 
thousands 
of 
Ten-
nesseans, are pushing back on. 
I have to tell you, I had a telephone 
townhall last night. It was with some 
of the counties that are around Chat-
tanooga, TN, in that area, and COVID– 
19 and the immigration policies of the 
Biden administration were the top 
questions that came up. 
I will tell you that things don’t look 
any better on the national security 
front. If you account for inflation, you 
find out that the topline request for 
the Department of Defense represents a 
$7 billion decrease compared to fiscal 
year 2021 funding levels. That is right, 
a $7 billion decrease for defense. Maybe 
they forgot that what we are respon-
sible for, first and foremost, is pro-
viding for the common defense. 
Talk about misplaced priorities. The 
Biden administration picked the abso-
lute worst time to undercut the mili-
tary and employ President Obama’s de-
mand to do more with less. We know 
from experience that it takes between 3 
and 5 percent in annual growth to keep 
our military and national security pro-
grams competitive, and this budget 
doesn’t even come close to hitting that 
mark. For reference, China increased 
their defense budget by 6.8 percent this 
year—oh, and who is our main compet-
itor when it comes to great power com-
petition? You are right. The answer is 
China, absolutely. 
Biden’s budget, on the other hand, 
asks for $112 billion in R&D spending, 
but it cuts procurement spending. 
Imagine that. This means, as of right 
now, the administration has no plan to 
put that R&D to good use. Keep doing 
the research and development, but by 
the way, we are not planning to pur-
chase. Think about that. Think about 
the message that sends to our allies 
and the message it is sending to our ad-
versaries. 
They paid lip service to supporting 
our nuclear programs, but earlier this 
month, the Secretary of the Navy sent 
a strategic memo ordering the service 
to defund the development of the nu-
clear sea-launched cruise missiles that 
are essential for deterring China in re-
gional waters. That is right. The Sec-
retary of the Navy sent a strategic 
memo ordering the Navy to defund the 
development of the missiles that are 
essential for deterring China in re-
gional waters. 
The kicker? All of this is to be done 
before the Nuclear Posture Review is 
even completed. So don’t wait for the 
report. We need an outcome, and the 
outcome is, Let’s make ourselves less 
competitive. 
This is astounding. Instead of fol-
lowing the directives that have clearly 
been laid out by last year’s NDAA and 
investing in a combat-credible force, 
the budget guts and confuses the mis-
sion driving the Pacific Deterrence Ini-
tiative, and this has had bipartisan 
support. Keep in mind that this is the 
best set of tools we have against Chi-
nese aggression in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion, and the Biden administration has 
decided to use it like some sort of slush 
account for projects that, in a normal 
year, would be funded under other cat-
egories. 
They are going for an outcome. The 
outcome is not ‘‘America first’’ or an 
America able to defend. Their budget is 
cutting defense. Their budget is cut-
ting these cruise missiles. It makes no 
sense. 
And I can assure you, as we begin the 
NDAA negotiations, that this is some-
thing that will deserve and will get a 
full review. 
I have said it before and I will say it 
again: The American people understand 
that elections do have consequences. 
They knew that some priorities would 
change with President Biden. Even my 
friends back home who voted for Presi-
dent Biden will tell me they liked what 
they heard on the campaign trail from 
him. But they will also tell you they 
did not vote for this. 
They did not vote for what is hap-
pening, for the Executive orders that 
are coming out of this administration, 
for the ridiculousness that they see in 
this budget. They did not vote for tax 
plans that will stand in the way of 
local investment with small businesses. 
They did not vote to make things more 
expensive and scarce at the grocery 
store. They did not vote to fund a 
bloated and power-hungry Federal bu-
reaucracy. They didn’t vote to leave 
our border in shambles, to wreck our 
Nation’s sovereignty. 
They certainly didn’t vote for a de-
fense strategy that will allow the Chi-
nese Communist Party to expand their 
influence into underdeveloped coun-
tries and threaten our allies in the 
Indo-Pacific. No, they did not vote for 
that.

bless them. And we worry about the 
lack of attention to defense. 
I would remind my Democratic col-
leagues that any action they take on 
this budget proposal won’t exist in a 
vacuum, and I ask them to reconsider 
their justification for asking the Amer-
ican people, who just survived a global 
pandemic and a near total economic 
collapse—I think they should recon-
sider their justification for asking 
them to bankroll an activist-driven, 
radical, fantasy budget that nobody 
really asked for. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNITED STATES INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the U.S. 
Innovation & Competition Act the Sen-
ate passed yesterday sends a loud, clear 
signal to the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and to the Chi-
nese Communist Party: American for-
eign policy is grounded in our values, 
and we will work with our allies to de-
fend our interests and to protect our 
friends. Enactment of this bill will 
place the United States in a much 
stronger position to thwart Chinese ag-
gression, uphold human rights, in-
crease U.S. competitiveness, and en-
hance our national security. 
I am proud to have worked on a bi-
partisan basis with Chairman MENEN-
DEZ and Ranking Member RISCH and 
other colleagues in both parties to put 
forward legislation ensuring that de-
fense of human rights and good govern-
ance and upgrading our armory in the 
battle against corruption remains at 
the forefront of our national security 
policy. 
This measure will complement the 
action President Biden took just last 
week to define the fight against cor-
ruption as a ‘‘core U.S. national secu-
rity interest.’’ In the National Security 
Study Memorandum the President re-
leased on June 3, he ordered a high- 
level review of how our government, 
our partners, and others can work to-
gether to combat illicit, corrosive cor-
rupt activity. 
The interagency review that he di-
rected the National Security Advisor 
to lead should yield a robust strategy 
that brings all the tools at the disposal 
of the United States to bear on one of 
the most consequential problems we 
face. I look forward to seeing the re-
sults of this high-level report and 
working with the Biden-Harris admin-
istration to target corruption wherever 
we find it. In the meantime, the legis-
lation the Senate has passed will pro-
vide the Executive with more tools. 
While corruption is a global issue—no 
country is immune from the disease 
that is corruption—it is important that 
we bring this fight directly to the Chi-
nese Government. S. 1260 calls for a re-
port to Congress on the corruption and 
corrupt activities of the senior officials 
of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China so that the United 
States can expose these individuals and 
hold them accountable. 
Congress cannot—and must not—turn 
a blind eye to the People’s Republic of 
China’s shocking, systematic abuse of 
its Uighur population, as well as of eth-
nic Kazakhs, Kyrgz, and other Muslim 
minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur 
autonomous region. This ongoing geno-
cide demands a forceful U.S. response. 
The U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act protects the innocent victims of 
these atrocities by authorizing appro-
priations for protecting human rights 
to include programs that prioritize the 
protection and advancement of the 
freedoms of association, assembly, reli-
gion, and expression for women, human 
rights activists, and ethnic and reli-
gious minorities in China. The bill also 
authorizes and encourages the imposi-
tion of sanctions relating to forced 
labor and with respect to systematic 
rape, coercive abortion, forced steri-
lization, and involuntary contraceptive 
implantation in the Xinjiang Uighur 
autonomous region. 
Beijing’s plan to circumvent Hong 
Kong’s independent legal system with a 
far-reaching, oppressive national secu-
rity law is dangerous and in complete 
disregard of the principles of the ‘‘one 
country, two systems.’’ S. 1260 ensures 
that we stand with Hong Kong’s citi-
zens for their freedoms, democracy, 
and basic human rights by authorizing 
funding for the promotion of democ-
racy in China and specifically in Hong 
Kong. 
Until the Chinese Communist Party 
changes its behavior, we and our allies 
and partners must hold it accountable. 
This bill reiterates our strong, bipar-
tisan commitment to working together 
to call out brutal regimes and use tools 
like the Global Magnitsky Act to hold 
individuals accountable for their viola-
tions of human rights and corrupt 
practices. 
The bill permanently reauthorizes 
the Global Magnitsky Act, allowing 
the U.S. Government to continue to 
utilize this valuable tool. While this is 
a crucial step, I also hope we signifi-
cantly expand the Global Magnitsky 
sanctions authority by adopting pa-
rameters used to implement Executive 
Order 13818. 
The United States can counter Chi-
nese threats to our national security 
by upholding our values, emphasizing 
transparency, and exposing corruption, 
but other nations must see that we 
live, as well as preach, our values. 
I am gratified that S. 1260 includes 
my proposal to expand a ban on 
postemployment by senior State De-
partment officials on lobbying the U.S. 
Government on behalf of any foreign 
governments and state-owned entities. 
Doing so ensures that the U.S. Govern-
ment practices what we preach, remov-
ing the appearance that our diplomats 
might be doing less than their best on 
behalf of the American people in order 
to position themselves for immediate 
postemployment jobs advocating for 
foreign interests. 
I was pleased to join many of my col-
leagues in supporting several specific 
initiatives to hold the Chinese Com-
munist Party and other regimes ac-
countable. 
The Transnational Repression Ac-
countability & Prevention, TRAP, Act, 
which I am proud to co-lead with my 
colleague Senator WICKER, who is also 
ranking member of the U.S. Helsinki 
Commission, takes aim at the perva-
sive and pernicious problem of authori-
tarian abuse of INTERPOL. Dictators 
regularly submit to INTERPOL abu-
sive red notices and diffusions based on 
false or trumped-up charges in an ef-
fort to coerce law enforcement agen-
cies in democratic countries to harass 
and even extradite those who have spo-
ken out against oppression and corrup-
tion. 
Bill 
Browder, 
who 
ensured 
that 
Sergei Magnitsky’s courage and integ-
rity became known to the world and 
who worked closely with me on the 
Magnitsky Act, has been subject to no 
fewer than eight abusive INTERPOL 
red notices submitted by the Russian 
Government. While Bill Browder’s case 
is emblematic of the wider problem, he 
is by no means alone. Countries such as 
Russia, China, and Turkey regularly 
file abusive red notices to go after 
those individuals who have fallen afoul 
of these regimes, despite this being a 
clear violation of INTERPOL’s con-
stitution. 
Adding the TRAP Act to S. 1260 
would do three things. First, it sets 
priorities for the United States in re-
sponding to INTERPOL abuse and pro-
moting reform within INTERPOL. It is 
critical that the United States use its 
voice, vote, and influence within the 
organization to reestablish its rule of 
law foundation. Second, it identifies 
areas for improvement in the U.S. Gov-
ernment’s 
response 
to 
INTERPOL 
abuse and mandates that the Agencies 
tasked with managing U.S. engage-
ment at INTERPOL examine and deter-
mine who the abusers are, their tac-
tics, and how the United States can 
best respond. Finally, it protects the

U.S. judicial system from the influence 
of abusive INTERPOL notices by clear-
ly mandating that no person may be 
extradited solely because of a red no-
tice or diffusion. 
Thanks to the TRAP Act, autocrats 
will be much less able to abuse 
INTERPOL’s information-sharing pro-
tocols, and dissidents can sleep better 
at night knowing that the long arm of 
dictatorship will be held at bay. 
I am also pleased to have worked 
with Senator RUBIO to include in S. 
1260 the South China Sea & East China 
Sea Sanctions Act. This measure au-
thorizes the President to impose block-
ing sanctions and prohibit visas for 
Chinese individuals who contribute to 
construction or development projects 
and those who threaten the peace, se-
curity, or stability of the South China 
Sea, SCS, or East China Sea, ECS. Chi-
na’s military has been creating artifi-
cial islands in the South China Sea and 
thereby asserting that its sovereignty 
extends into the long-recognized terri-
torial waters of other nations and they 
are using these creations as military 
outposts to threaten their neighbors 
further. The SCS & ECS Sanctions Act 
also imposes sanctions on foreign fi-
nancial institutions that knowingly 
conduct or facilitate a significant fi-
nancial transaction for sanctioned per-
sons if China takes several actions in 
the SCS or ECS. 
Finally, the measure gives the Exec-
utive authorization to curtail foreign 
assistance to countries that recognize 
China’s sovereignty in the SCS or the 
ECS, 
with 
exceptions 
for 
Taiwan, 
counterterrorism, democracy support, 
counter-narcotics, global health, and 
humanitarian assistance. 
Collectively, all of the provisions I 
have just discussed reinforce the values 
that drive our foreign policy. The U.S. 
Innovation & Competition Act will 
prove to be an important tool in coun-
tering the People’s Republic of China 
and 
other 
authoritarian 
regimes 
around the world. I want to commend 
Senator SCHUMER for his persistence 
with respect to bringing this bipartisan 
bill to the floor, and for allowing its 
consideration under regular order.

REMEMBERING EARL MICHAEL 
WILLIS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life of a young 
man who was not only an intern in my 
congressional office but also a friend. 
Earl Michael Willis was born on May 
29, 1993, in Baton Rouge and was the be-
loved son of Earl and Cristal Willis. He 
grew up in Brusly, LA, and attended 
Holy Family School and Catholic High 
School in Baton Rouge. Michael devel-
oped a strong connection to God during 
his formative years, especially through 
close friendship with Father Michael 
Allelo, and his Christian faith and val-
ues were an important aspect of his 
daily life. When Michael was in middle 
school, his sister Rachael Lynn passed 
away from cancer. From that point on, 
Michael’s life was dedicated to his sis-
ter’s memory, and he and his family 
participated in many Light the Night 
events. More recently, Michael and his 
wife Megan established a nonprofit 
foundation 
named 
‘‘Running 
for 
Rachael’’ in honor of his sister. 
Ever since working at River Road 
Day Care in Port Allen in high school, 
Michael was passionate about advo-
cacy. At age 20, he became a legislative 
assistant to Cindy Bishop of Check-
mate Strategies and went on to become 
the director of business development 
for the firm after finishing college. Mi-
chael graduated from Louisiana State 
University in May 2015 in political 
science. While at LSU, he was an active 
member of the Phi Kappa Psi frater-
nity and vice president of policy for 
The 
Center 
for 
Development 
and 
Learning, where he led the center’s 
‘‘Literacy and Economic Development’’ 
summit and led a highly successful 
‘‘Literacy Day at the Capitol.’’ Michael 
married the love of his life, Megan 
Voda, on April 17, 2020. He possessed an 
incomparable measure of love and de-
votion for his wife, his parents, and all 
of his family. Sharing quality time 
with them was always atop his list of 
priorities. 
Michael is survived by his wife 
Megan, parents Earl and Cristal Willis, 
brother Nicholas Boudreaux, nephews 
Noah and Nicholas Boudreaux, mother- 
and father-in-law Cris and Tim Voda, 
sister-in-law Katie Voda, his honorary 
nephews Beau Seymour and Harrison 
Danna, his honorary nieces Lilly Sey-
mour and Caroline Danna, and a host 
of aunts, uncles, extended family, and 
friends. Michael Willis was a truly lov-
ing and inspiring individual who al-
ways ensured that those around him 
felt loved, valued, and appreciated. He 
will be deeply missed, but his memory 
will live on forever in the hearts of 
those who knew and loved him.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JACK BUELL 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, along 
with my colleague Senator JIM RISCH, I 
congratulate Jack Buell, of St. Maries, 
ID, on his extraordinary 46 years of 
public service as Benewah County com-
missioner. We thank him for contrib-
uting his time, talent, and resources to 
the people of St. Maries, Benewah 
County, and to Idaho. 
Throughout his time in leadership, 
Jack has earned deep respect and admi-
ration for his unwavering commitment 
to the community and county he loves. 
Jack Buell was first elected Benewah 
County commissioner nearly five dec-
ades ago in 1974, and he served steadily 
as commissioner until December 2020. 
Jack is known as someone who can be 
counted on to help meet the needs of 
the community. For example, Jack 
made his own property available to the 
U.S. Forest Service to use as a fire 
base. There are many other examples 
of his generosity and outstanding serv-
ice, as he seems to never tire of doing 
what needs to be done. 
Jack is truly a stalwart of our great 
State. He and his wife Eleanor own 
Jack Buell Trucking based in St. 
Maries. This business has long been a 
pillar in the community, providing jobs 
that support families and contributing 
to Benewah County’s economic base. In 
addition to his business and service as 
Benewah County commissioner, Jack 
has supported and served on boards for 
many local and State organizations. He 
has been formally recognized for his 
contributions to the community and 
State, including his 2012 induction into 
the Idaho Hall of Fame and receiving 
the Idaho Distinguished Service Medal 
in 2021. 
Jack is someone with great integrity, 
dedication, experience, wisdom, and in-
stitutional knowledge. He adds humor, 
curiosity, know-how, humility, and 
hard work to the countless challenges 
he has faced throughout his remark-
able career. Jack has led by example 
for decades, and despite all he has 
done, he is not resting from service. We 
understand his ongoing efforts include 
increasing safety on the roads of St. 
Maries. 
Thank you, Jack, for all you have 
done and continue to do for Idahoans. 
We are honored to join many others in 
expressing our gratitude to you for a 
lifetime of exceptional service.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for 
himself, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. BRAUN, 
Mr. BARRASSO, Ms. ERNST, Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Mr. 
TUBERVILLE, 
Mr. JOHNSON, and Ms. LUMMIS): 
S. 1990. A bill to establish processes 
to control inflationary pressures and 
the Federal debt, during Federal debt 
emergencies; to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
America is in a debt crisis. It appears, 
for Joe Biden and my colleagues across 
the aisle, reckless spending has only 
just begun. If left unchecked, this 
spending will be devastating for fami-
lies in my State of Florida and all 
across our great Nation. 
Washington’s insane spending has 
our Federal debt rocketing toward $30 
trillion. That is equal to $233,000 of 
debt for every American family. Think 
about 
that. 
America’s 
debt 
crisis, 
caused by decades of wasteful and reck-
less spending by Washington politi-
cians, has now grown to the equivalent 
of every American family owing a 
quarter of a million dollars in debt. Yet 
Biden and my colleagues across the 
aisle want more. 
President Biden is pushing for tril-
lions in wasteful spending, raising the 
U.S. Federal debt by 60 percent, to $39 
trillion, and the debt-to-GDP ratio to 
117 percent in 2030, the highest level 
ever recorded in American history. 
Enough is enough. It is time to end 
the madness. 
Today I am introducing the Federal 
Debt Emergency Control Act to help 
bring some accountability back to 
Washington. 
On July 31, the current suspension of 
the Federal debt ceiling is set to ex-
pire, giving Congress a choice: Act re-
sponsibly 
to 
reduce 
Federal 
debt 
through structural reform to how we 
approach spending or suspend the debt 
ceiling again, allowing more reckless 
spending that will cripple our Nation 
with insurmountable debt. 
Reckless spending has consequences. 
We are already seeing rising inflation. 
Let’s remember, inflation doesn’t hurt 
the rich, but it devastates our poorest 
families. It hurts families like mine 
growing up. It hurts poor families. It 
hurts people on fixed incomes. Just 
look around us. Milk prices are up. 
Bread prices are up. Gas prices are up. 
Meat prices are up. It seems like every-
thing is up right now. 
When inflation happened in the sev-
enties, I watched. I watched what my 
parents went through. At that point, 
my mom was taking in ironing from 
other families to make ends meet. At 
the end of the day, whatever she had 
made that day, either my older brother 
or I would go to the grocery store, and 
we would watch—and she was worried 
about milk and food, all of the prices 
going up. She said, ‘‘You only have this 
amount of money,’’ and we had to 
know what everything cost before we 
went to the checkout counter. 
It is not fair. No family should have 
to go through worrying about the price 
of bread and milk and things going up 
week after week. 
We can get control of inflation. We 
can put our Nation on a fiscally re-
sponsible path, but we have to have 
real solutions that hold Congress ac-
countable. 
My Federal Debt Emergency Control 
Act aims to rein in Washington’s out- 
of-control 
spending 
with 
concrete 
checks and balances, including the dec-
laration of a Federal debt emergency 
anytime the debt exceeds 100 percent of 
GDP. 
By the way, once debt equals 100 per-
cent of GDP, it is very difficult to start 
paying down debt. You have to dra-
matically either reduce spending or 
dramatically grow your economy. 
Declaring a Federal debt emergency 
would initiate commonsense debt re-
duction measures, including a require-
ment that two-thirds of Congress vote

to increase the debt before approving 
any bill with deficit spending. 
It would also terminate any unobli-
gated funding for the American Rescue 
Plan Act and any previous stimulus 
bills, sending it back to the Treasury 
General Fund for deficit reduction to 
reduce our debt. 
Finally, it would ensure that any bill 
reducing the Federal debt by at least 5 
percent over 10 years is fast-tracked 
through the legislative process. 
Everyone can get behind these com-
monsense measures. That is why my 
bill is already endorsed by the National 
Taxpayers Union, the Council for Citi-
zens 
Against 
Government 
Waste, 
Americans for Tax Reform, Americans 
for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, and 
Club for Growth. 
I am also proud to have the support 
of Senators CRUZ, BRAUN, BLACKBURN, 
JOHNSON, 
BARRASSO, 
ERNST, 
and 
TUBERVILLE as cosponsors of this im-
portant legislation. 
With President Biden’s budget pro-
posal—and just to put that in perspec-
tive, his budget proposal is $6 trillion. 
This year, our Federal receipts are 
only going to be $3.5 trillion. How can 
we expect to run trillions and trillions 
and trillions of dollars of deficit year 
after year? With his budget proposal, 
we see how important the need is to 
get Washington’s awful spending habits 
under control and start paying down 
our debt. 
I did it before. I did it as Governor of 
Florida. I walked in with a $4 billion 
deficit. I started reducing taxes my 
first year. We reduced it every year in 
8 years, and we cut over a third of the 
State debt. We did it by being respon-
sible, by holding government account-
able for watching how we spent every 
dollar. It can be done. 
So getting back on track is possible, 
but it takes discipline. It takes ac-
countability. It starts with taking con-
crete 
steps, 
like 
rejecting 
bloated 
budgets and passing commonsense leg-
islation like the Federal Debt Emer-
gency Control Act. We have the chance 
to do this. We know the vote over the 
debt ceiling increase is a tough vote for 
everybody. Let’s take this opportunity 
to have real structural reform so we 
can start paying down our debt and not 
leave this debt to future generations.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 264—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
PROTECTING 
FREEDOM 
OF 
SPEECH, 
THOUGHT, 
AND 
EX-
PRESSION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN (for herself, Ms. 
LUMMIS, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. CRAMER, Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH, and Mr. TILLIS) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 264 
Whereas freedom of speech is one of the 
most basic values of the United States; 
Whereas the ability of all people of the 
United States to speak, protest, and express 
their opinions publicly is central to the 
democratic process and to a free society; 
Whereas the principles of the freedom of 
speech and the freedom of expression are 
under attack by people with the desire and 
means to suppress opinions that those people 
regard as offensive or contrary to prevailing 
dogmas; 
Whereas efforts to stifle debate and silence 
dissenters are compounded by cancel culture, 
a movement to impose severe social and eco-
nomic sanctions on those who express un-
popular opinions; 
Whereas the freedom of speech should not 
be dictated by the majority, nor should it be 
restricted 
to 
the 
freedom 
to 
discuss 
uncontroversial topics; 
Whereas the freedom of speech includes the 
freedom to express views that are unpopular, 
controversial, and even offensive; 
Whereas these attacks on the freedom of 
speech have resulted in a chilling effect on 
free expression and created fear of social, 
economic, and deadly retaliation; 
Whereas the stifling of free expression and 
the resulting fear has exacerbated social ten-
sions and divided the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas, in January 2018, a student at Lib-
erty High School in Oregon was suspended 
for wearing a shirt that supported President 
Donald Trump; 
Whereas, in January 2018, authorities from 
the People’s Republic of China pressured 
Marriot International to fire an employee 
for using the company’s social media ac-
count to like a Twitter post from a Tibetan 
separatist group; 
Whereas, in July 2018, the People’s Repub-
lic of China pressured airline companies 
from the United States to alter their 
websites to recognize the country’s claim to 
the island of Taiwan; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Blizzard Enter-
tainment temporarily banned Ng Wai Chung 
from their esports tournament for wearing a 
mask supporting protests in Hong Kong; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Blizzard Enter-
tainment temporarily banned an American 
University esports team from their competi-
tion for displaying a sign critical of the com-
pany and supporting protests in Hong Kong;

People’s Republic of China pressured Daryl 
Morey, the general manager of the Houston 
Rockets basketball team, to apologize for ex-
pressing support on Twitter for protests in 
Hong Kong; 
Whereas, in September 2020, the University 
of Southern California placed Professor Greg 
Patton on leave after explaining a word in 
the Mandarin language that is pronounced 
similarly to an offensive word in English 
during his lecture; 
Whereas, in December 2020, opinion editor 
Adam Rubenstein resigned from the New

Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself 
and Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 265 
Whereas, on June 12, 2016, a gunman in-
spired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
targeted the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, 
Florida, where he killed 49 innocent victims 
and wounded dozens more in a despicable at-
tack; 
Whereas the attack at the Pulse nightclub 
was an attack on the LGBTQ community, 
the Hispanic community, the City of Or-
lando, the State of Florida, and the United 
States; 
Whereas the Orlando community continues 
to mourn the tragic loss of life, but has dem-
onstrated remarkable strength, unity, and 
resilience in the aftermath of the horrendous 
event; 
Whereas June 12 is designated as ‘‘Pulse 
Remembrance Day’’ in the State of Florida 
to honor the victims and survivors of the 
senseless attack; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
continue to pray for those affected by the 
tragedy; and 
Whereas June 12, 2021, marks 5 years since 
the lives of the 49 innocent victims were 
tragically cut short by the senseless act of 
terrorism: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the 49 victims killed in 
the attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, 
Florida, on June 12, 2016, and offers heartfelt 
condolences to the families, loved ones, and 
friends of the victims; 
(2) honors the dozens of survivors of the at-
tack and pledges continued resolve to stand 
against terrorism and hate; and 
(3) expresses gratitude to the brave law en-
forcement and emergency medical personnel 
who responded to the attack.

brain tumor in the United States in 2021, and 
an estimated 87,240 individuals in the United 
States were diagnosed with a primary brain 
tumor in 2020;

children who are under 14 years of age and 
teens who are under 19 years of age; and 
(2) third leading cause of death from cancer 
in young adults who are between 20 and 39

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4021 
June 9, 2021 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, approximately 700,000 indi-
viduals in the United States are living with 
a brain tumor; 
Whereas treatment of brain tumors is com-
plicated by the fact that more than 130 types 
of brain tumors exist; 
Whereas the treatment and removal of 
brain tumors present significant challenges 
due to the uniquely complex and fragile na-
ture of the brain; 
Whereas brain tumors affect the primary 
organ in the human body that controls not 
only cognitive ability, but the actions of 
every other organ and limb in the body, lead-
ing to brain tumors being described as a dis-
ease that affects the whole individual; 
Whereas brain tumor research is supported 
by a number of private, nonprofit research 
foundations and by Federal medical research 
institutions; 
Whereas basic research may fuel advance-
ments and development of new treatments 
for brain tumors; 
Whereas obstacles to the development of 
new treatments for brain tumors remain, 
and there are limited strategies for the 
screening or early detection of brain tumors; 
Whereas, despite the high number of indi-
viduals diagnosed with a brain tumor every 
year and the devastating prognoses for those 
individuals, only 5 drugs and 1 medical de-
vice are approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to treat brain tumors; 
Whereas the mortality rates associated 
with brain tumors have changed little during 
the 30-year period preceding the date of in-
troduction of this resolution; 
Whereas there is a need for greater public 
awareness of brain tumors, including the dif-
ficulties associated with research on brain 
tumors and the opportunities for advances in 
brain tumor research and treatment; and 
Whereas May 2021, during which brain 
tumor advocates nationwide unite in aware-
ness, outreach, and advocacy activities, is an 
appropriate month to recognize as ‘‘National 
Brain 
Tumor 
Awareness 
Month’’: 
Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 2021 as 
‘‘National Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’; 
(2) encourages increased public awareness 
of brain tumors to honor the individuals who 
have lost their lives to a brain tumor or cur-
rently live with a brain tumor diagnosis; 
(3) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for brain tumors that will improve the 
quality of life and the long-term prognoses of 
individuals diagnosed with a brain tumor; 
(4) expresses its support for individuals 
who are battling brain tumors, as well as the 
families, friends, and caregivers of those in-
dividuals; and 
(5) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
tumor research, which is a promising means 
of advancing understanding of, and treat-
ment for, brain tumors.
