PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious and Almighty God, in re-
cent days, so many voices across our 
Nation and within this House have 
prayed for peace and unity. In answer 
to our pleas, speak Your love into the 
hearts of each Member, that the delib-
erations of this 117th Congress would 
bring amity with our compatriots and 
hope to America. 
As we look across the aisle, may we 
pause to look for and see You in the 
face of each one who, in seeking to 
serve in such a time as this, brings 
their God-given passion, their heart- 
felt dedication, their very selves, to 
these Chambers. 
May that simple yet profound aware-
ness serve to diffuse animosity and dis-
pel any inclination for disparagement 
or ridicule. And may it compel each of 
us to approach the tasks of this day 
with humility and graciousness of spir-
it. 
Thus, may we then honor our respon-
sibility to reflect You to those with 
whom You have called us to serve and 
to serve with. That we, as instruments 
of Your love for us and for this Nation, 
would attend to the good work of 
bringing Your justice, Your truth, and 
Your peace to our country. 
We pray these things in the strength 
of Your holy name. 
Amen.

clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her des-
ignee shall consult with the Minority Leader 
or his designee on the designation of any 
matter for consideration pursuant to this 
subsection. 
(c) The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule 
XIII for a two-thirds vote to consider a re-
port from the Committee on Rules on the 
same day it is presented to the House is 
waived with respect to any resolution re-
ported through the legislative day of Janu-
ary 28, 2021. 
Mr. HOYER (during the reading). 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
MOTION TO POSTPONE CONSIDERATION 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I really 
think that my good friends in the ma-
jority need more time to present a fair 
rules package. So I move to postpone 
consideration of H. Res. 8 until Janu-
ary 5, 2021. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I move 
that the motion to postpone consider-
ation be tabled. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to table. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 214, nays 
204, not voting 11, as follows:

Mr. GREEN of Texas changed his 
vote from ‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ 
So the motion to table was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
Stated against: 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I missed 
votes due to circumstances beyond my con-
trol. Had I been present, I would have voted 
‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 5. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER) is 
recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the time allo-
cated to me be controlled by the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN), the chairman of the Rules 
Committee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), my good friend, pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H. Res. 8. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, a 
rules package is one of the most con-
sequential things we will consider in 
this entire Congress. 
As we stand here in the opening days 
of this Congress, I am proud that the 
reforms before us represent a collabo-
rative process that began many months 
ago. We asked Members on both sides 
of the aisle for ideas; we listened to our 
many caucuses and coalitions; we spent 
hours in the Rules Committee listening 
to input during our Member Day hear-
ing; and we spoke with the outside 
groups that study these issues. 
Weeks and weeks of thoughtful dis-
cussion got us to this point. That proc-
ess made the final product an even 
stronger one—not for one party or the 
other, but for this institution and for 
all those Americans counting on us to 
represent them; not the special inter-
ests or the monied interests, but our 
workers and those struggling to get 
ahead. 
This is a rules package that encour-
ages us to tackle the most pressing 
issues facing our Nation today, like cli-
mate change, through the continued 
work of the Select Committee on the 
Climate Crisis. 
I want to thank Chairwoman CASTOR 
for her leadership, along with Chair-
man 
PALLONE
and 
Congresswoman 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, who have encouraged 
us to think big when confronting the 
threat of climate change. 
We are confronting the pandemic 
without any waste or fraud. That is 
through the ongoing work of the Select 
Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Cri-
sis, under the stewardship of Chairman 
CLYBURN. 
It makes reforms to our budget rules 
so we can deal with these dual chal-
lenges through an all-hands-on-deck 
approach, while maintaining fiscal re-
sponsibility. 
I want to recognize the many Mem-
bers, especially the Blue Dogs, the Pro-
gressives, and the New Democrats, who 
worked together to make this com-
promise happen. 
We are also focusing on those who 
have traditionally been left behind 
through the creation of a new Select 
Committee on Economic Disparity and 
Fairness in Growth. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI for 
her commitment to making sure that 
our policies lift up every single Amer-
ican. 
This 
new 
select 
committee 
will 
sharpen our focus on the income and 
wealth disparity crisis that plagues our 
Nation today. 
This package honors all gender iden-
tities by changing pronouns in the 
House rules so they are gender neutral. 
Look, we made this change for the 
sake of inclusion, not exclusion. But I 
have got to be honest with you. I heard 
the distinguished minority leader say 
that this rules package was canceling 
Mother’s Day. I mean, are you kidding 
me? 
He also claimed that these rules 
make it so Members can no longer say 
‘‘father,’’ ‘‘mother,’’ ‘‘son,’’ or ‘‘daugh-
ter.’’ Madam Speaker, has he even read 
these rules? That is just not accurate. 
That is not how this works. 
And, by the way, our Founding Fa-
thers are still our Founding Fathers. 
Madam Speaker, maybe this is meant 
as a distraction. Maybe if we can cre-
ate a controversy, then we are not 
talking about the ongoing pandemic, 
from which over 350,000 people have al-
ready died due to mismanagement and 
incompetence, or maybe we are not 
talking about the attempted coup 
being planned down at 1600 Pennsyl-
vania Avenue. But the bottom line is 
what has been said is just not accurate. 
I love this. Someone just handed me 
this. A Member on the other side from, 
I think, Arizona, for instance, tweeted: 
If I stand up and I say that I am a proud 
husband of my wife of almost 40 years now, 
then they would say that I violated the rules 
because you can no longer use any version of 
husband or father or gender reference be-
tween man and woman. 
I don’t know what the hell he is talk-
ing about, Madam Speaker. Oh, my 
God; that is my response to this. 
I mean, Madam Speaker, this is why 
people really are frustrated with Con-
gress and with Washington. I think we, 
in this Chamber, need to hold ourselves 
to a higher standard when it comes to 
facts and reality. Unlike the White 
House, this should not be a fact-free 
zone; we ought to focus on facts. 
If my Republican friends want to dis-
agree on policy, we can disagree on pol-
icy. There are lots of issues that sepa-
rate us, and we should debate those 
issues. That shouldn’t be a radical idea. 
But people shouldn’t make things up 
just to create a controversy. Accuracy 
matters, and it should come before say-
ing whatever helps you get another hit 
on FOX News. 
Anyway, Madam Speaker, for those 
who insist on trying to disparage what 
we have done in the written rules, I 
want you to bring the bill to the floor 
and show me where it says, in writing, 
that we are canceling Mother’s Day or 
that you can’t refer to yourself as a 
husband or father or mother or grand-
mother. 
Give me a break. Enough is enough. 
We have to stop this. We have to focus 
in on solving the problems that face 
the American people. 
This rules package also requires that 
oversight plans from committees in-
clude how they intend to combat race, 
gender, and other inequities. It makes 
the Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
permanent. This will commit our insti-
tution to creating a diverse workforce 
for many years to come. 
As we tackle these issues, Madam 
Speaker, this rules package creates a 
more transparent process for ideas to 
be considered. It makes permanent the 
requirement that all bills that come 
before the Rules Committee get a hear-
ing and a markup first. It preserves the 
motion to recommit, while making re-
forms so that it can no longer be used 
to hijack the legislative process for po-
litical gamesmanship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H21 
January 4, 2021 
We are also continuing temporary 
rules changes that have ensured we 
completed the people’s work as safely 
as possible during this coronavirus 
pandemic. I am impressed with how 
this Congress was able to adapt and 
find a way to function in the midst of 
this worldwide health emergency. Dur-
ing the pandemic in 1918, Congress was 
not able to adapt, but we did. 
I would just say to my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle that we need to 
listen to the Speaker’s recommenda-
tion that we all continue to follow the 
best and most current health and med-
ical guidance. 
Madam Speaker, we acted. While we 
can and we should do much more for 
Americans struggling today, I am 
proud of what we were able to accom-
plish in the last year. It is no small 
part due to the implementation of re-
mote voting by proxy and the develop-
ment 
of 
virtual 
committee 
pro-
ceedings. 
Admittedly, Congress isn’t always 
known for being on the cutting edge of 
the digital world. This rules package, 
however, seeks to change that even fur-
ther. It contains many reforms de-
signed to help us better embrace tech-
nology so that we can get our work 
done 
as 
efficiently 
and 
as 
trans-
parently as possible. 
Congresswoman ESHOO and the Select 
Committee on the Modernization of 
Congress, 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
Chairman KILMER, were instrumental 
in these new changes. 
Madam Speaker, now, I just want to 
speak candidly for a moment. 
As important as these reforms are 
and as proud of them as I am, I know 
there is something even more impor-
tant, and that is the foundation that 
they are built upon. 
Ethical leadership must be the bed-
rock principle of this and every Con-
gress. If the American people do not 
begin to trust their fundamental insti-
tutions again, then division, conspir-
acies, and mistruths will continue to 
fester. 
b 1230 
This body, each of us, must do our 
part. No matter what side of the aisle 
you are on or who you vote for, we 
must hold ourselves to the highest 
standard of leadership. People can and 
should question our positions on the 
issues, but we should never act in a 
way that invites anyone to question 
our motivation. That is why this rules 
package doesn’t just tinker at the 
edges, it breaks new ground through 
transformative reforms. 
It 
removes 
floor 
privileges 
for 
formers Members convicted of crimes 
related to their House service or elec-
tion. This will ensure that we can do 
our work here without the undue influ-
ence of law breakers. We task the Eth-
ics Committee to come up with a bipar-
tisan plan to handle ‘‘deepfakes,’’ be-
cause we need to stop the spread, in-
tentional or unintentional, of manipu-
lated media that is created to mislead 
the public. 
I will note that we initially plan to 
go even further, amending our Code of 
Conduct with this rules package, but 
we heard some of our colleagues’ con-
cerns. We agreed to take a little bit 
more time to get the language just 
right, and we will do that through our 
bipartisan Ethics Committee. 
Thanks to the leadership of Congress-
woman 
PORTER
of 
California, 
we 
strengthen Truth in Testimony disclo-
sures for witnesses that testify before 
Congress. Now the public and all Mem-
bers will have more information about 
those who appear before congressional 
committees. 
Our rules will further protect whis-
tleblowers. This package prevents re-
taliation. It also makes permanent an 
office dedicated to ensuring congres-
sional offices know how to handle whis-
tleblower complaints in a responsible 
and secure way. 
I want to recognize the tremendous 
work of many people, from Majority 
Leader 
HOYER
and 
Congresswoman 
SPEIER to members of the Progressive 
Caucus that made these reforms a re-
ality. In short, we are holding our-
selves to a higher standard, Madam 
Speaker, not by changes developed in a 
vacuum just among ourselves. We also 
spoke with outside groups and experts 
and included their feedback. This is 
how 
the 
package 
was 
developed, 
through conversation, collaboration, 
and consultation. 
My Rules Committee colleagues, in-
cluding Ranking Member COLE, offered 
input that was invaluable. Our com-
mittee chairs and their excellent staffs 
worked with us early in the morning 
and late at night as this package took 
shape. I am deeply grateful for the 
work of all of our caucuses, including 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the 
Congressional Black Caucus, the New 
Democrat 
Coalition, 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
Equality Caucus, the Congressional 
Asia Pacific American Caucus, and the 
Blue Dog Coalition. 
The Problem Solvers Caucus was, 
once again, involved with crafting this 
package. 
I 
always 
appreciate 
the 
chance to work with Congressman 
GOTTHEIMER
and Congressman REED. 
We even got to work with a new mem-
ber of the Problem Solvers this Con-
gress, Representative VAN TAYLOR. And 
I could go on and on. 
Input from the nonpartisan staffs 
across this institution made this pack-
age stronger. That includes those with 
the offices of the Parliamentarian, the 
Congressional Budget Office, the Clerk, 
the General Counsel, the Congressional 
Research Service, the Sergeant at 
Arms, and the Chief Administrative Of-
ficer, just to name a few. Many staffers 
worked through the holidays on this, 
and I am deeply grateful for their ef-
forts, especially the incredible staff on 
the Rules Committee. 
Democrats have been entrusted by 
the American people to lead this insti-
tution, but the rules package is about 
more than party. It is about making 
this Chamber work at its best for the 
people we represent. These reforms will 
do that. They will hold us to a higher 
standard so we can get it done for them 
and in a way that makes the public 
proud. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support in passing this package, and 
let’s implement real reforms so we can 
quickly get to work on behalf of the 
American people. 
Before I reserve the balance of my 
time, I just want to take one second, 
Madam Speaker, to thank my Repub-
lican colleagues on the Rules Com-
mittee. We don’t always agree on ev-
erything, but they are up in the Rules 
Committee diligently at every meeting 
making the case for their side of the 
aisle. 
I especially want to thank my rank-
ing member, Mr. COLE, who cares deep-
ly about this institution. And while we 
probably will not agree on this rules 
package, we agree that we need to 
make this a better place, and we need 
to hold it to the highest standards in 
terms of integrity, and to make sure 
the American people have trust in 
what we do here. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Massachusetts, my 
very good friend, Chairman MCGOVERN, 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes; and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
address 
the 
majority’s 
proposed 
changes in the Rules of the House of 
Representatives for the 117th Congress. 
These changes are some of the 
harshest and most cynical that I have 
experienced during my time in Con-
gress. Democratic leadership is sup-
pressing minority rights and paving 
the way for the Green New Deal by in-
tentionally removing budgetary checks 
that have been in place for over a dec-
ade. 
The most egregious of these changes 
is the complete gutting of the motion 
to recommit. The motion to recommit, 
or the MTR, is the minority’s right to 
propose a final amendment before mov-
ing passage. This is a right that has 
been guaranteed to the minority for 
well over a century. 
With today’s changes, the majority is 
seeking to silence views they are afraid 
of with no regard for this institution or 
the American people’s trust in our con-
stitutional responsibility to govern and 
govern well. They are taking away the 
ability to debate a motion to recommit 
and the ability to offer a motion to re-
commit with instructions. This com-
pletely guts the minority’s ability to 
offer a last amendment on the floor 
prior to passage of legislation. 
I would remind my colleagues that 
during the many years Republicans 
were in the majority, we never even 
thought to deny the minority this mo-
tion. And the only reason Democrats 
are doing so today is out of embarrass-
ment. They are embarrassed that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H22 
January 4, 2021 
Republicans were able to pass eight 
motions to recommit in the 116th Con-
gress. But rather than acknowledging 
that Republicans sometimes have good 
policy ideas that should be incor-
porated into legislation, the majority 
is instead seeking to completely cut off 
this key right, and that, Madam 
Speaker, is simply reprehensible. 
Madam Speaker, the motion to re-
commit has been around since the be-
ginning of the House as an institution, 
and it has been in its present form 
since 1909. In fact, in 1919, Representa-
tive Abraham Garrett of Tennessee, 
noted that ‘‘the motion to recommit is 
regarded as so sacred it is one of the 
few rules protected against the Com-
mittee on Rules by the general rules of 
the House.’’ 
And when Speaker PELOSI was herself 
in the minority, she equated the mo-
tion to recommit with the right of free 
speech enshrined in our Constitution. 
How this majority can now decide that 
a procedure that is so important it is 
on par with the guarantee of free 
speech must be eliminated is beyond 
my understanding. 
Madam Speaker, it is simply shock-
ing that Democrats are so afraid of Re-
publican ideas that they feel the need 
to rig the system against us. They 
don’t want the House to work its will. 
They only want the Speaker’s will. And 
we all know why that is. It is because 
the majority cannot effectively defend 
its policies against competing ideas. 
Eight times in the last Congress a 
majority of the House agreed that the 
Republican policy idea had merit and 
should be included in the final bill. But 
that state of affairs is evidently so em-
barrassing to Democrats that they 
can’t stand it, and now they have to 
completely shut down minority rights 
lest they be embarrassed further, espe-
cially after the November election 
dealt them a harsh blow and they lost 
seats in their own ranks. 
Madam Speaker, I want to offer my 
friends on the other side of the aisle a 
word of warning: Majorities do not last 
forever. If there is one certainty we can 
take away from the history of Amer-
ican politics, it is that the party in 
power in the House of Representatives 
today will not hold that position for-
ever. I can also guarantee you that 
your efforts to shut us down will not 
shut us up. 
So instead of having bills that pass 
with 
slight 
improvements 
made 
through an MTR, bills will fail here on 
the House floor. And for that reason, 
among others, I am sure Democrats 
will 
regret 
making 
this 
egregious 
change in the very near future. Repub-
licans are proud to debate our policies 
and proposals, unlike the majority 
today, whose record of promised open-
ness and fulsome debate is an abject 
failure. 
Now, Madam Speaker, while gutting 
the MTR may be the worst piece of this 
rules package to many, I want to ap-
plaud my friends for removing an al-
most equally egregious piece of this 
rules package. When the majority re-
leased this package over the weekend, 
there was a particularly noxious provi-
sion that would have empowered the 
Speaker of the House to censor the free 
speech of Members and employees of 
the House. What is worse, it would 
have empowered the Speaker to act as 
the sole judge, jury, and executioner, 
and included no clear guidelines for 
how this would be enforced. This pro-
posed rule was downright un-American. 
Fortunately, my friends on the other 
side of the aisle have listened to reason 
and removed that provision from this 
package. I wish they had further lis-
tened to reason and removed the provi-
sion taking away the minority’s right 
to an MTR, which is why I offered a 
very reasonable motion to postpone for 
one day. 
Madam Speaker, I could go on all day 
about the MTR, but there are other 
changes in this rules package that need 
to be highlighted. Slipped into the 
package is another change that will ef-
fectively eliminate the paygo rule. 
Paygo is a useful budgetary control 
measure that essentially says that we 
can’t spend money that we don’t have. 
But if the majority gets their way, 
paygo will be eliminated for a broad 
category of topics, including for meas-
ures relating to climate change. This is 
doing nothing more than removing a 
key barrier to the Green New Deal and 
other liberal tax-and-spend policies. 
But never before has the majority 
tried to lift budgetary rules on some-
thing as absurdly expensive as the 
Green New Deal, which is estimated to 
cost as much as $100 trillion over the 
next decade, should it be enacted. 
It is clear that the majority doesn’t 
even want to have a conversation 
about the cost of the Green New Deal, 
and instead wants to ensure that the 
American people never find out about 
the cost of their extreme plans. 
There are other measures in this 
rules package that are just as absurd. 
Not content with having investigated 
President Trump throughout his Presi-
dency and subjected him to pointless 
impeachment, now Democrats are in-
cluding provisions allowing them to 
send subpoenas to former Presidents, 
former Vice Presidents, and former 
White House staff, long after their ad-
ministration has ended. 
This provision is a continuation of 
the Democratic majority’s obsession 
with investigating President Trump 
and his administration, and ensures 
they will be able to keep their inves-
tigation gravy train rolling along long 
after the President leaves office. 
There is a similar provision which 
will allow certain committee chairs to 
reissue subpoenas prior to the com-
mittee organizing for the 117th Con-
gress, thus ensuring that existing in-
vestigations into President Trump, no 
matter how silly or pointless, will not 
have to slow down or even let the new 
Congress consider their current merits 
or legislative justification. 
Allowing a chair to issue subpoenas 
without any consultation with mem-
bership or with the minority is nothing 
less than an abuse of power. But I sup-
pose I should not expect any less given 
the other provisions in this package. 
Madam Speaker, despite my affection 
for my friend on the other side of the 
aisle, I have to tell him that this pack-
age stinks. It is deeply cynical and 
deeply short-sighted. It tramples on 
minority rights and it ensures a power 
grab by Democratic leadership. It will 
change the nature of this institution, 
and not for the better. 
Madam Speaker, today, I call on all 
Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rules 
package. I ask all of my colleagues, re-
gardless of party, to reject these rad-
ical and, at times, ridiculous changes. I 
call on all my colleagues to protect mi-
nority rights. The future of this insti-
tution depends on it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for his comments, I will put 
him down as undecided on this pack-
age. 
I am sure we will hear more about 
the motion to recommit throughout 
this debate, but I do just want to point 
out for the record, to be historically 
accurate, that the motion to recommit 
has had many different forms since its 
first inception. In fact, it was very, 
very different when I first ran for Con-
gress. 
But having said all that, I would tell 
the gentleman that if those who initi-
ated the motion to recommit way back 
when saw how it was being used today, 
I think they would object very strongly 
to it. They didn’t see it as a tool to 
play political gotcha games to under-
mine legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I would also remind 
the gentleman that, you know, quite 
frankly, most of the motions to recom-
mit that passed, all the Republicans 
voted against final passage of whatever 
bill it was. So the issue is not one of 
being a constructive legislator. It has 
turned into a political gotcha game. 
I think that we all talk about read-
ing the bill. The problem with the mo-
tion to recommit is you don’t get to 
see what it is you are proposing until a 
few minutes beforehand. I just want 
the RECORD to reflect that. 
On the issue of paygo, I would just 
remind the gentleman that when the 
Republicans were in charge, they had 
this thing called CutGo, and they ex-
empted all kinds of things from CutGo. 
They exempted efforts to gut the Af-
fordable Care Act. They exempted tax 
cuts for billionaires and corporations. 
So I think what we are talking about 
is a modest exemption for two inter-
national emergencies, the COVID pan-
demic and the climate crisis. Most peo-
ple, except for a few in Washington, ac-
tually believe that it is not only a na-
tional emergency, but an international 
emergency. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
CRIST).

Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise to address an amendment that 
I have placed in the bill, and I want to 
thank the chairman for his grace in al-
lowing that. It talks about addressing 
racial and ethnic impacts of legislation 
that we pass here. 
America is known for the words at 
the United States Supreme Court: 
‘‘Equal justice under the law.’’ Equal 
justice. 
We struggle in our country with 
equality. Why? The color of somebody’s 
skin? Their ethnic background? Who 
they might love? 
I think it is important to recognize 
that above me are the words: ‘‘E 
pluribus unum,’’ ‘‘Out of many, one.’’ 
We are all children of God. If we so 
choose, we can bring people together. 
We can start right here, and we can 
begin right now. We need to remember 
the words kindness, respect, decency, 
compassion, empathy. In other words, 
embrace the golden rule. 
I wear these yellow wrist bands on 
my hands every day, and they say: 
Practice the golden rule every day. Do 
unto others as you would have done 
unto you. 
That is what I am attempting in this 
amendment. God bless. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 30 seconds to respond to my 
friend. 
I remind my friend that you accepted 
eight MTRs, or eight were approved, 
because Democrats decided the Repub-
lican proposals were good proposals 
and made the bill better. We couldn’t 
have done it on our own. So, you are 
actually limiting the choices in front 
of your own Members. 
We might not feel so strongly about 
the MTR if we got more amendments 
approved anyway. We only get about 18 
percent of the amendments. When we 
were in the majority, we gave you 45. 
We got 38. You now get 68. So, you are 
taking a tool away that is important 
to us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS), my very good friend and 
the distinguished ranking member on 
the House Administration Committee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my good 
friend, Mr. COLE, yielding. 
It is disappointing that House Demo-
crats have completely dismissed the 
first opportunity to work together in 
this new Congress to instill voter con-
fidence and protect the integrity of our 
election process. 
The purpose of H. Res. 5 is to address 
many of the election administration 
problems that occurred in 2020, some-
thing I have encouraged the Committee 
on House Administration and this 
House to address long before the 2020 
general election. 
The resolution would have required 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion to report out a bill that contains 
five main provisions: 
First, a provision to ensure this 
House’s commitment to upholding the 
U.S. Constitution by maintaining that 
it is States that have the primary au-
thority to conduct elections, not the 
Federal Government. 
Second, it ensures ballot integrity 
for votes cast by mail. 
Third, this provides a Federal base-
line for signature verification. 
Fourth, it includes measures to im-
prove voter confidence and certainty in 
our election results by counting ballots 
in a timely manner. 
And lastly, a provision to ensure 
proper oversight of Federal dollars pro-
vided to States to help them admin-
ister elections through the Help Amer-
ica Vote Act. 
These issues are nonpartisan. They 
are problems both sides struggled with 
in the 2020 election. As the committee 
with jurisdiction over Federal elec-
tions, it is our responsibility to address 
them. 
Arguably, the time to address these 
issues was before the 2020 election, but 
it is never too late to do the right 
thing. 
In 2020, more than 65 million people 
voted by mail, more than ever before. 
Just as we have baseline standards for 
administering in-person elections, we 
should have them for mail-in voting. 
Baseline standards for these ballots 
would help ensure every legal vote is 
counted. 
There 
were 
many 
last-minute 
changes made during the 2020 cycle, in 
the name of COVID–19, that chipped 
away at the integrity of our election 
system, and it is important that we do 
not maintain this pandemic-style vot-
ing in the long term. 
The worst thing that can happen to 
our government is for the American 
people to lose all confidence in our 
elections. There are bipartisan steps we 
can take to help restore public con-
fidence in our elections and protect our 
Republic. 
While it is disappointing that House 
Democrats have dismissed the first op-
portunity in this new Congress to work 
together to protect the integrity of our 
elections, I am hopeful that, working 
with Chairman MCGOVERN, Ranking 
Member COLE, and Chairperson LOF-
GREN and others in this arena, we can 
set politics aside to achieve this goal. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a section by sec-
tion of the changes H. Res. 8 will make 
to the standing rules of the 116th Con-
gress and the separate orders taking ef-
fect for the 117th Congress. 
H. RES. 8 
ADOPTING THE RULES FOR THE 117TH 
CONGRESS 
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS 
Section 1. Adoption of the Rules of the One 
Hundred Sixteenth Congress. 
This section provides that the Rules of the 
116th Congress are the Rules of the 117th 
Congress, except for the amendments con-
tained in section 2 of the resolution and or-
ders contained in the resolution. 
Section 2. Changes to the Standing Rules. 
Conforming Change. Subsection (a) strikes 
outdated language that no longer exists in 
statute authorizing the Clerk to maintain on 
the House payroll the staff of a former 
Speaker. This authority, established through 
2 U.S.C. § 5128, was repealed by Public Law 
115–244 in the 115th Congress. 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion and Office 
of the Whistleblower Ombuds. Subsection (b) 
codifies the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, 
established in the 116th Congress in House 
Resolution 6, into the standing rules of the 
House. The subsection instructs the Speaker, 
in consultation with the Minority Leader, to 
appoint a Director of the Office from rec-
ommendations provided by the chair of the 
Committee on House Administration in con-
sultation with the ranking minority mem-
ber. The Office is subject to the policy direc-
tion and oversight of the Committee on 
House Administration and will direct and 
guide House employing offices to recruit, 
hire, train, develop, advance, promote, and 
retain a diverse workforce; survey and evalu-
ate diversity in House employing offices; 
submit a House of Representatives diversity 
report each session; and provide consultation 
and guidance in furtherance of increasing di-
versity and inclusion in the House. 
Subsection (b) also codifies the Office of 
the Whistleblower Ombudsman, established 
in the 116th Congress in House Resolution 6, 
and changes its name to the gender-neutral 
Office of the Whistleblower Ombuds. The 
subsection instructs the Speaker, in con-
sultation with the chairs and ranking minor-
ity members of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration and the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, to appoint a Director of 
the Office. The subsection instructs the Of-
fice, under the direction of the Committee 
on House Administration, and in consulta-
tion with other committees at the request of 
their chairs or ranking members, to develop 
best practices for whistleblower intake for 
House offices and provide training to House 
offices on how to safely receive information 
from whistleblowers. 
Continuing Authority to Act in Litigation 
Matters. Subsection (c) clarifies existing 
practice that the continuing authority to act 
in litigation matters provided by clause 8(c) 
of rule II includes, but is not limited to, the 
authority for committee chairs to imme-
diately reissue subpoenas, prior to the orga-
nization of their committees, to ensure liti-
gation can continue uninterrupted. 
Admittance to the Hall of the House. Sub-
section (d) adds the Mayor of the District of 
Columbia to the list of persons who are per-
mitted in the Hall of the House. The sub-
section also adds a new restriction on who 
may access the Hall of the House, barring 
former Members, Delegates, Resident Com-
missioners, Parliamentarians, elected offi-
cers of the House, or minority employees 
nominated as an elected officer of the House 
if they have been convicted of a crime re-
lated to their election, or service to, the 
House. 
Gender-Inclusive Language. Subsection (e) 
modernizes the use of pronouns, familial re-
lationship terminology, and other references 
to gender in order to be inclusive of all Mem-
bers, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, 
employees of the House, and their families. 
This also obviates the need for the former 
clause 2 of rule XXIX, which provided that 
‘‘words importing one gender include the 
other as well.’’ 
Committee on Armed Services. Subsection (f) 
adds the Marine Corps and the Space Force 
to the list of U.S. military service branches 
covered under the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services. Neither addition 
substantively alters the committee’s current

jurisdiction, and both are clarifying and 
technical in nature. 
Committee Oversight Plans. Subsection (g) 
requires committees to include in their over-
sight plan a discussion of how the commit-
tee’s work will address issues of inequities 
on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, reli-
gion, sex, sexual orientation, gender iden-
tity, disability, age, or national origin. 
Printing and Availability Requirements. Sub-
section (h) modifies two requirements re-
lated to the method by which specific types 
of legislative texts must be made available. 
First, instead of requiring that primary ex-
pense resolutions reported by the Committee 
on 
House 
Administration 
be 
physically 
printed and available on the calendar day 
prior to their consideration, this subsection 
now allows this availability period to begin 
when the text is made available electroni-
cally or in printed form. Second, this sub-
section modifies the requirement that re-
ports on Senate amendments in disagree-
ment by a conference committee, and any 
accompanying statements, be available for 
72 hours in the Congressional Record. This 
72-hour period now begins when the relevant 
text is either made available in the Congres-
sional Record or made publicly available at 
an electronic document repository operated 
by the Clerk. 
Committee Vote Availability. Subsection (i) 
modernizes the requirement for committees 
to make the results of record votes publicly 
available by removing the requirement that 
they be made available to the public for in- 
person inspection in committee offices. Com-
mittees will still be required to make the re-
sults of record votes publicly available elec-
tronically within 48 hours of the vote. 
Amendment 
Availability. 
Subsection 
(j) 
builds on the requirement for committee 
chairs to make amendments adopted by their 
committees publicly available within 24 
hours by requiring all other amendments— 
which includes failed or withdrawn amend-
ments—to be posted within 48 hours of their 
disposition or withdrawal. This requirement 
does not apply to amendments not offered. 
Truth-In-Testimony Reform. Subsection (k) 
amends the disclosure requirements for wit-
nesses appearing in nongovernmental capac-
ities by: (1) adding grants to the reporting 
requirement for foreign payments; (2) ex-
panding the lookback period for reporting to 
36 months; (3) requiring witnesses to disclose 
whether they are the fiduciary of any organi-
zation or entity with an interest in the sub-
ject matter of the hearing; and (4) requiring, 
to the extent practicable, the disclosures be 
made publicly available 24-hours prior to the 
witness’s appearance at a hearing. The sub-
section also updates the text of clause 2(g)(5) 
of rule XI for clarity. 
Electronic Filing of Reports and Electronic 
Signatures. Subsection (l) authorizes elec-
tronic filing of committee reports, which 
was temporarily allowed by House Resolu-
tion 965 of the 116th Congress, and allows 
electronic signatures to be used for signed 
views in committee reports and for select 
forms received by the Committee on Ethics. 
Reports received electronically will be proc-
essed as otherwise provided in rule XIII, and 
committees filing electronic reports should 
continue to consult with the Clerk regarding 
proper format and other administrative re-
quirements. 
Subpoena Authority. Subsection (m) affirms 
that committees and subcommittees, pursu-
ant to the longstanding subpoena authority 
granted by clause 2(m) of rule XI, may au-
thorize and issue subpoenas for documents or 
testimony to any person or entity, whether 
governmental, public, or private, within the 
United States. The language makes clear 
that 
the 
rule 
expressly 
authorizes 
the 
issuance of subpoenas to any current or 
former President and Vice President, either 
in their personal or official capacity, as well 
as the White House, the Office of the Presi-
dent, the Executive Office of the President, 
and any individual currently or formerly em-
ployed by those entities. This is not a change 
to, but rather a clearer affirmation of, exist-
ing authorities. 
Committee on Ethics. Subsection (n) pro-
vides that a Member may serve on the Com-
mittee on Ethics during a fifth Congress in a 
period of five successive Congresses if they 
are the chair or ranking member of the com-
mittee. It also clarifies that various provi-
sions within clause 3 of rule XI apply to Del-
egates and Resident Commissioners. 
Audio and Video Recordings. Subsection (o) 
modifies the description of committee pro-
ceedings that may not be used or made avail-
able for any partisan political campaign pur-
pose to clarify the provision’s application to 
all such audio and video coverage regardless 
of the specific technological device recording 
medium used. 
Cosponsorship Withdrawal. Subsection (p) 
eliminates the requirement that a Member, 
Delegate, or Resident Commissioner obtain 
unanimous consent to remove their name as 
a cosponsor of a bill or resolution, instead al-
lowing the Member, Delegate, or Resident 
Commissioner to remove their own name by 
making a demand from the floor. The spon-
sor of a bill, however, must still make a 
unanimous-consent request in order to re-
move a cosponsor, and cosponsors may still 
only be removed until the last committee of 
referral reports the bill to the House or is 
discharged from its consideration. 
Comparative Prints. Subsection (q) removes 
the requirement, added in the 115th Con-
gress, that prior to the consideration of bills, 
joint resolutions, and amendments in the na-
ture of a substitute, comparative prints 
must be made available. However, section 
3(j) of this resolution directs the relevant 
committees and offices of the House to con-
tinue efforts to further the institutional pri-
ority of enabling all House staff to produce 
such comparative prints. 
Requiring Committee Hearing and Markup on 
Bills and Joint Resolutions. Subsection (r) 
codifies in the standing rules of the House a 
separate order from the 116th Congress re-
quiring a committee hearing and markup in 
order for most bills and joint resolutions to 
be considered pursuant to a special order of 
business reported by the Committee on 
Rules. The subsection provides a point of 
order against consideration if such a meas-
ure has not been reported by at least one 
committee, effective March 1st of an odd- 
numbered year. A point of order also lies 
against any bill or joint resolution reported 
by a committee if the report does not con-
tain a list of relevant committee and sub-
committee hearings which includes the des-
ignation of at least one such hearing that 
was used to develop or consider the under-
lying measure. Finally, the provision pro-
vides exceptions to the points of order for 
resolutions continuing appropriations for a 
fiscal year, measures that contain specified 
emergency designations pursuant to the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act, measures considered pursuant to the 
Consensus Calendar, and measures not re-
ferred to committee. Pursuant to section 
3(u), because of the challenges facing com-
mittees operating during a pandemic, this 
rule will not take effect in the 117th Con-
gress until April 1, 2021. 
Motion to Recommit. Subsection (s) provides 
that a motion to recommit (or commit) a 
bill or joint resolution to a standing or se-
lect committee may only be made without 
instructions and is not debatable. It also pro-
vides that the previous question is consid-
ered as ordered on any such motion. The sub-
section makes a conforming change to the 
prohibition on the Committee on Rules from 
reporting a rule preventing a motion to re-
commit in order to remove the specification 
that instructions must be permitted. The 
subsection also removes the now extraneous 
mandates that motions to recommit with in-
structions must be in the form of a direction 
to be reported back to the House forthwith 
and that instructions in a motion to recom-
mit to conference may not include argu-
ment. The rule continues to prioritize rec-
ognition of an opponent of the underlying 
measure, but the Chair will address con-
tested opposition when challenged on the 
floor rather than continuing the practice of 
querying for opposition at the time the mo-
tion is made. 
District of Columbia Business. Subsection (t) 
removes a no-longer-used provision setting 
aside the second and fourth Mondays of a 
month for District of Columbia business 
called up by the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform. 
Title Amendments. Subsection (u) limits the 
offering of amendments to the titles of bills 
and resolutions to the Majority Leader or a 
designee. 
Reconciliation 
Directives. 
Subsection 
(v) 
strikes the contents of clause 7 of rule XXI, 
which created a point of order against a con-
current resolution on the budget, amend-
ments to a budget resolution, or a conference 
report on a budget resolution, containing 
reconciliation directives that would have the 
effect of increasing net direct spending. 
Clause 10 of rule XXI, the PAYGO rule, con-
tinues to apply to any reconciliation meas-
ure reported pursuant to such directives. 
Availability of Measures. Subsection (w) 
modifies the text availability requirement 
for unreported bills and joint resolutions by 
specifying that the 72-hour availability pe-
riod may begin when the text of the measure 
is made electronically available prior to its 
introduction. Although the introduced meas-
ure must consist of the exact text of the lan-
guage made electronically available prior to 
introduction in order to qualify under this 
updated rule, changes to a measure’s text 
made after its introduction by a self-exe-
cuting special rule do not impact this avail-
ability period. 
Prohibited Service. Subsection (x) modifies a 
provision in the Code of Official Conduct 
added in the 116th Congress prohibiting 
Members, Delegates, the Resident Commis-
sioner, officers, and employees of the House 
from serving as an officer or director of any 
public company by replacing a direction to 
the Committee on Ethics to develop regula-
tions with a requirement for compliance 
with such regulations as the Committee has 
since promulgated these regulations. 
Code of Official Conduct. Subsection (y) 
adds two new clauses to the Code of Official 
Conduct. First, the new clause 20 of rule 
XXIII protects Congressional whistleblowers 
by preventing a Member, Delegate, Resident 
Commissioner, officer, or employee of the 
House from taking any actions to prevent an 
individual from, or to retaliate against an 
individual for, providing truthful informa-
tion to the Committee on Ethics, the Office 
of Congressional Ethics, the Office of Con-
gressional Workplace Rights, or any law en-
forcement official, provided that the disclo-
sure of such information is not otherwise 
prohibited by law or House rules. 
Second, the new clause 21 of rule XXIII fur-
ther protects the identities of whistleblowers 
by prohibiting a Member, Delegate, Resident 
Commissioner, officer, or employee of the 
House from knowingly and willfully publicly 
disclosing the identity or personally identifi-
able information of an individual who is 
granted protections under federal whistle 
blower laws. Exempted from this prohibition

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H25

are cases in which: (1) the individual has pro-
vided express written consent prior to such 
disclosure; (2) the individual has already vol-
untarily and publicly disclosed their iden-
tity; or (3) the disclosure is by the chair of a 
committee after an affirmative vote by two- 
thirds of the committee members that such 
disclosure is in the public interest. Addition-
ally, nothing in this new whistleblower pro-
tection will inhibit the investigation of any 
allegation of wrongdoing disclosed by any in-
dividual or prevent the public disclosure of 
substantive information shared that is not 
personally identifiable. Disclosures by the 
chair of a committee are subject to appro-
priate safeguards, including advance notice 
to the individual including a written expla-
nation of the reasons for the disclosure. 
Communications Standards Commission. Sub-
section (z) renames the House Commission 
on Congressional Mailing Standards to the 
House Communications Standards Commis-
sion, conforming to a change made in H.R. 
133 of the 116th Congress. The new name re-
flects the Commission’s jurisdiction over all 
mass communications. 
Section 3. Separate Orders. 
Member Day Hearing Requirement. Sub-
section (a) requires each standing committee 
(except for the Committee on Ethics) to hold 
a Member Day Hearing during the first ses-
sion of the 117th Congress to hear testimony 
from Members, Delegates, and the Resident 
Commissioner—whether or not they are a 
member of the committee—on proposed leg-
islation within its jurisdiction. The sub-
section permits the Committee on Rules to 
hold its Member Day Hearing during the sec-
ond session, in order to receive testimony on 
proposed changes to the standing rules for 
the next Congress. 
Deposition Authority. Subsection (b) pro-
vides the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence and each standing committee of 
the 117th Congress (except for the Committee 
on Rules) the authority to order the taking 
of a deposition by a member or counsel of 
such committee. Members, Delegates, and 
the Resident Commissioner may participate 
in all such depositions, but their presence is 
not required. Depositions taken under this 
authority are subject to regulations issued 
by the chair of the Committee on Rules and 
printed in the Congressional Record, and 
such authority continues to include poten-
tial supplemental regulations. 
War Powers Resolution. Subsection (c) ex-
pressly provides that any motion to dis-
charge a measure introduced pursuant to 
section 6 or section 7 of the War Powers Res-
olution would not be subject to a motion to 
table. 
Exercise Facilities for Former Members. Sub-
section (d) continues the prohibition on ac-
cess to any exercise facility that is made 
available exclusively to Members, Delegates, 
the Resident Commissioner, former Mem-
bers, former Delegates, former Resident 
Commissioners, officers, and former officers 
of the House and their spouses to any former 
Member, former Delegate, former Resident 
Commissioner, former officer, or spouse who 
is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying 
Disclosure Act of 1995 or any successor stat-
ute, or who is an agent of a foreign principal 
as defined in clause 5 of rule XXV. 
Empaneling Investigative Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Ethics. Subsection (e) carries 
forward House Resolution 451 from the 110th 
Congress, directing the Committee on Ethics 
to empanel an investigative subcommittee 
or issue a report within 30 days of the date a 
Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commis-
sioner is indicted or criminal charges are 
filed. The subsection updates any references 
in House Resolution 451 to the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct to be ref-
erences tot e Committee on Ethics. 
Non-Disclosure Agreements. Subsection (f) 
continues a provision from the 116th Con-
gress which provides that Non-Disclosure 
Agreements required by offices as a condi-
tion of employment for paid or unpaid staff 
or contractors cannot require notice or ap-
proval for employees to communicate with 
the Committee on Ethics, the Office of Con-
gressional Workplace Rights, or any other 
office or entity designated by the Committee 
on House Administration; and that Non-Dis-
closure Agreements must also provide clear 
guidance to that effect. 
Requiring Members to Pay for Discrimination 
Settlements. Subsection (g) continues from 
the 116th Congress a requirement for a Mem-
ber, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner 
to reimburse the Treasury for any settle-
ment of a complaint related to a claim alleg-
ing a violation by the Member of sections 
201(a), 206(a), or 207 of the Congressional Ac-
countability Act of 1995, which cover dis-
crimination based on race, color, religion, 
sex (which the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission recognizes as including 
sexual orientation and gender identity), na-
tional origin, age, disability, or an employ-
ee’s service in the uniformed services, and 
retaliation for claims alleging such discrimi-
nation. 
Mandatory Anti-Harassment and Anti-Dis-
crimination Policies for House Offices. Sub-
section (h) continues from the 116th Congress 
a requirement that each House office adopt 
an anti-harassment and anti-discrimination 
policy and requires the Committee on House 
Administration to issue regulations to carry 
out the subsection by April 1, 2021. 
Displaying Statement of Rights and Protec-
tions Provided to House Employees. Subsection 
(i) continues from the 116th Congress a re-
quirement that the Committee on House Ad-
ministration 
issue 
regulations 
requiring 
each House office to prominently display a 
statement of the rights and protections pro-
vided to House employees under the Congres-
sional Accountability Act of 1995, including 
procedures available to employees for re-
sponding to and adjudicating allegations of 
workplace rights violations. 
Broadening Availability and Utility of Legis-
lative Documents in Machine-Readable For-
mats. Subsection (j) instructs the Committee 
on House Administration, the Clerk, and 
other officers and officials to continue to ad-
vance government transparency by taking 
further steps to publish documents of the 
House in machine-readable formats and 
broaden their utility by enabling all House 
staff to create comparative prints. 
Improving the Committee Electronic Document 
Repository. Subsection (k) directs the Clerk, 
the Committee on House Administration, 
and other officers and officials to improve 
the existing electronic document repository 
operated by the Clerk for use by committees. 
Such improvements are intended to increase 
public availability and identification of leg-
islative information produced by House com-
mittees, including votes, amendments, and 
witness disclosure forms. 
Inclusion of Citations for Proposed Repeals 
and Amendment. Subsection (I) continues a 
requirement for parallel citations, to the 
maximum extent practicable, for amend-
atory instructions to Public Laws and Stat-
utes at Large that are not classified in the 
U.S. Code. 
Providing for Transparency with Respect to 
Memorials Submitted Pursuant to Article V of 
the Constitution of the United States. Sub-
section (m) carries forward provisions that 
clarify the procedures of the House regarding 
the receipt of Article V memorials from the 
States by directing the Clerk to make each 
memorial, designated by the chair of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, electronically 
available, organized by State of origin and 
year of receipt, and indicate whether the me-
morial was designated as an application or 
rescission. 
In carrying out this subsection, it is ex-
pected that the chair of the Committee on 
the Judiciary will be solely charged with de-
termining whether a memorial purports to 
be an application of the legislature of a state 
calling for a constitutional convention or re-
scission of prior applications. The Clerk’s 
role will be entirely administrative. The 
chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will 
only designate memorials from state legisla-
tures (and not petitions from individuals or 
other parties), as it is only state legislatures 
that are contemplated under Article V of the 
Constitution. 
In submitting each memorial to the Clerk, 
the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary 
will include a transmission letter that indi-
cates it has been designated under this sub-
section of House Resolution 5. The Clerk will 
make publicly available the memorial and 
the transmission letter from the chair. An-
cillary documentation from the state or 
other parties is not expected to be pub-
licized. 
Subcommittees. Subsection (n) waives clause 
5(d) of rule X to allow the Committee on Ag-
riculture up to six subcommittees, which is 
consistent with authorities in the 114th, 
115th, and 116th Congresses. 
Congressional Member Organization Trans-
parency Reform. Subsection (o) continues to 
allow participating Members to enter into 
agreements 
with 
eligible 
Congressional 
Member Organizations for the purpose of 
payment of salaries and expenses. The sub-
section requires that for the organization to 
be eligible during the 117th Congress, the or-
ganization must register with the Com-
mittee on House Administration, designate a 
single Member to be responsible for the ad-
ministration of the organization, have at 
least 3 employees assigned to perform some 
work for the organization, and had at least 
15 Members during the 116th Congress using 
a portion of their Members’ Representational 
Allowance (MRA) to pay for the salaries and 
expenses of the organization. 
Budget Matters. Subsection (p) reestab-
lishes that the allocations, aggregates, and 
other appropriate levels as contained in the 
statement of the chair of the Committee on 
the Budget of May 1, 2020, as adjusted in the 
116th Congress, are effective pending the 
adoption of a fiscal year 2021 budget resolu-
tion. 
Reissuance of Subpoenas Prior to Committee 
Organization. Subsection (q) authorizes the 
chair of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form to issue subpoenas related to the Com-
mittee’s investigation, initiated during the 
116th Congress, into the accuracy and timing 
of the 2020 decennial census. The subsection 
also authorizes the chair of the Select Sub-
committee on the Coronavirus Crisis to issue 
subpoenas related to the Select Subcommit-
tee’s investigation, likewise initiated during 
the 116th Congress, into political inter-
ference in the response to the coronavirus 
pandemic at the Department of Health and 
Human Services and Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention. 
Numbering of Bills. Subsection (r) reserves 
the first 10 numbers for bills (H.R. 1 through 
H.R. 10) for assignment by the Speaker and 
the second 10 numbers (H.R. 11 through H.R. 
20) for assignment by the Minority Leader. 
Remote Voting by Proxy and Remote Com-
mittee Activity. Subsection (s) carries forward 
House Resolution 965 from the 116th Congress 
with the following changes: 1) notification 
and availability requirements do not apply 
to proxy revocation letters submitted to the 
Clerk after a Member has automatically re-
voked their proxy by voting in person; 2) 
committees may hold official business meet-
ings without submitting a letter regarding

requirements formerly contained in the re-
mote committee regulations; and 3) the chair 
of the Committee on House Administration 
is required, in consultation with the ranking 
member, to identify and submit to the 
Speaker and to the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Rules specific oper-
able and secure technology that may be used 
to conduct remote voting in the House—cer-
tification of that submission replaces a pre-
vious requirement in section 5(a) of H. Res. 
965. 
Witness Diversity. Subsection (t) requires 
the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to pro-
vide a report to the Committee on House Ad-
ministration and the Committee on Rules 
recommending a method to survey the diver-
sity of witness panels at committee hearings 
by July 1, 2021. It requires the Committees 
on House Administration and Rules to take 
any necessary steps to ensure its implemen-
tation by July 31, 2021. 
Requirements for Committee Hearing and 
Markup. Subsection (u) provides that during 
the 117th Congress, the requirement that 
committees hold a hearing and a markup for 
most bills and joint resolutions considered 
pursuant to a rule (added to the standing 
rules by section 2(r) of this resolution) shall 
not apply before April 1, 2021. This delay in 
implementation is due to the increased dif-
ficulty of organizing committees and holding 
committee proceedings during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Exemptions. Subsection (v) provides that 
the Chair of the Committee on Budget may 
adjust an estimate to exempt the budgetary 
effects of measures to prevent, prepare for, 
or respond to economic or public health con-
sequences resulting from the COVID–19 pan-
demic; and measures to prevent, prepare for, 
or respond to economic, environmental, or 
public health consequences resulting from 
climate change. 
Further Expenses for Resolving Contested 
Election. Subsection (w) authorizes such 
sums as may be necessary for the Committee 
on House Administration to resolve con-
tested elections. Funds shall be available for 
expenses incurred between January 3, 2021, 
and January 3, 2022. Amounts made available 
under this subsection shall be expended in 
accordance with regulations prescribed by 
the Committee on House Administration. 
Support for Senate Measures. Subsection (x) 
requires the Clerk to submit to the chair of 
the Committee on Rules by February 1, 2021, 
regulations establishing a process for House 
Members to indicate their support for Sen-
ate-passed measures that have been received 
by the House, including maintaining a pub-
licly available list of Members supporting 
each measure. The chair of the Committee 
on Rules is directed to print the regulations 
in the Congressional Record, at which point 
Members will be permitted to use the process 
to indicate their support for Senate meas-
ures. 
Dissemination of Manipulated Media. Sub-
section (y) directs the Committee on Ethics 
to report by December 31, 2021, any rec-
ommended amendments to the Code of Offi-
cial Conduct and any accompanying regula-
tions addressing the dissemination by elec-
tronic means of any image, video, or audio 
file that has been distorted or manipulated 
with the intent to mislead the public. 
Section 4. Committees, Commissions, and House 
Offices 
House Democracy Partnership. Subsection 
(a) reauthorizes the House Democracy As-
sistance Commission, now known as the 
House Democracy Partnership. 
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Sub-
section (b) reauthorizes the Tom Lantos 
Human Rights Commission. The subsection 
carries forward and makes minor modifica-
tions to provisions from the 116th Congress 
to reaffirm that the commission’s budget is 
in 
addition 
to 
and 
separate 
from 
the 
amounts authorized for salaries and expenses 
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and to 
ensure equal distribution of funding between 
the commission’s co-chairs to reflect the bi-
partisan structure of the commission.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
(Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, as 
we begin the 117th Congress, I am truly 
grateful to the Democratic Caucus for 
bringing the six representatives of the 
territories of the United States and the 
District of Columbia—duly elected by 4 
million 
Americans, 
collectively—to 
where we are today. 
That was done in the 116th Congress 
when the rules package strengthened 
our democratic representation by re-
turning floor voting rights to Dele-
gates and the Resident Commissioners 
in the Committee of the Whole. The 
principle that every American deserves 
to be represented by a vote on the floor 
of this House is important, and we have 
somewhat of a voice now. 
Moving forward, I think it is high 
time that we continue to expand that. 
The Constitution gives the fate, the 
rights, of all the territories solely to 
this body, to the Congress. That being 
said, it is important that we respect 
those votes, and I believe that our sys-
tem for remote voting should apply 
with respect to votes cast in the Com-
mittee of the Whole in the same man-
ner as it applies with respect to votes 
cast on the floor. 
That being said, I commend the fur-
ther strides we are making in this rules 
package. As a former prosecutor and 
counsel on the House Ethics Com-
mittee, I applaud the tightening of the 
whistleblower laws. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H27 
January 4, 2021 
Ms. PLASKETT. As a former counsel 
on the House Ethics Committee, I am 
pleased with the tightening of the 
whistleblower laws, and I commend the 
creation of the Select Committee on 
Economic Disparity and Fairness in 
Growth to recommend policies to ad-
dress economic disparities and make 
the economy work for everyone. I ex-
pect this to be a positive development, 
and I urge my colleagues to adopt this 
package. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), my very good 
friend and the distinguished Repub-
lican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
strongly object to this Soviet-style 
rules package. If you look at some of 
the things that are being laid out here, 
it is all designed to take away the 
voice of 48 percent of this House Cham-
ber. 
This is the people’s House. It is one 
of the great things that we celebrate 
about serving in the United States 
House of Representatives, a privilege 
for each of us who took that oath yes-
terday to represent roughly 750,000 peo-
ple, to bring their ideas, their hopes for 
America, to this House floor, to debate 
the things that they believe in, that we 
believe in, that we want to fight for. 
We don’t always agree. We don’t al-
ways see eye to eye on what that is, 
but the beauty is we get to bring those 
ideas here, have that debate here. Yet, 
the rules package is attempting to 
strip that away, to yank away more 
rights for hundreds of millions of 
Americans to be represented on this 
House floor. 
That is not who we are. That is not 
what the House of Representatives is 
all about. Yet, that is what will be 
voted on in this rules package. 
Just look at the motion to recommit. 
Now, if the majority were allowing us, 
Madam Speaker, to bring amendments 
to the floor on a regular basis, you 
might not need a motion to recommit. 
But less than 20 percent of all amend-
ments allowed on the House floor in 
the last 2 years were Republican 
amendments, less than 20 percent when 
we represent almost 49 percent of the 
Members of this body. That is not what 
an open, democratic institution is 
about. That is unbecoming of the 
House of Representatives. Yet, taking 
away that ability shows that the ma-
jority wants to shut down the debate of 
the other side, wants to shut down the 
voices not just of us but of the millions 
of people all across this country we 
represent. 
Think about the move to get rid of 
paygo, pay as you go, which had been a 
hallmark of Speaker PELOSI’s major-
ity. She gets rid of that on things like 
debating the Green New Deal. What 
does that tell you? That tells you that, 
number one, they plan on bringing the 
Green New Deal to the House floor, but 
they also know that it would have dev-
astating consequences on American 
families. The hardworking people—in 
fact, the ones who would be hit the 
hardest by it—are low-income families 
who would end up paying thousands of 
dollars more in household electricity 
costs. They want to hide that so they 
get rid of paygo so you don’t have to 
show what the cost to hardworking 
families would be for radical ideas like 
that. 
This is not who we are. I am a proud 
husband, a proud father of a son and a 
daughter. They don’t even want you to 
be able to say that anymore. 
Let’s open up the people’s House to 
real, honest discourse and debate. Let’s 
debate our differences and settle them 
here on the House floor, not try to hide 
the views of 48 percent of this country. 
I oppose this Soviet-style rules pack-
age. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, if 
the gentleman is interested in honest 
debate, I hope he will inform us where 
in the rules package it says that you 
can’t refer to yourself as a father, a 
son, a grandfather, a wife, I mean, 
whatever. There is nothing in the rules 
package that says that. This is not re-
ality. 
I would also remind the gentleman 
that when he was in charge, this was 
the most closed Congress in the history 
of the United States Congress. 
And if we are worried about pro-
tecting our democracy, I hope the gen-
tleman and others will join with us in 
protecting the will of the American 
people, the millions and millions of 
voters who cast their votes for Presi-
dent-elect Joe Biden and Vice-Presi-
dent-elect KAMALA HARRIS, and vote to 
make sure we have a smooth transition 
to the next administration. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a 
distinguished member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
In the 2 years that I have been here, 
every motion to recommit has been a 
poison pill, a gimmick designed to 
tank a bill or sow division between 
Members of Congress and their con-
stituents. 
Despite 
high-flung 
rhetoric 
here 
today, not once have I seen the MTR 
used to make legislation better. In 
fact, on those occasions when it pre-
vailed, our colleagues voted against the 
underlying bill. 
Since this legislative tool has not 
been used in good faith, it needs to be 
reformed. 
But I also wish to speak in favor of 
the efforts that have been made to use 
gender-neutral language in the rules. 
As a female Member of Congress and a 
member of last term’s Select Com-
mittee to Modernize Congress, I ap-
plaud the efforts to drag the rules 
package into the 21st century and 
make it more inclusive, as well as to 
make it streamlined. The text changes 
have allowed us to make the rules 
package more concise, and that is a 
good thing. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
quickly respond to my friend. 
Ms. SCANLON said the eight MTRs 
that passed this House were poison 
pills. By definition, they weren’t. They 
passed the House. Democrats voted for 
them. Things like fighting against 
anti-Semitism is hardly a poison pill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. 
LESKO), my very good friend. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Democrats’ power has literally gone 
to their heads. They aren’t satisfied 
enough to have the majority and the 
speakership, so now they want to si-
lence opposing viewpoints altogether. 
They are undoing minority rights 
that have been a part of Congress for 
over 100 years by taking away debate 
on the motion to recommit, something 
that, while in the minority, now- 
Speaker PELOSI
actually equated to 
free speech. Obviously, now that she is 
in power, she wants to take away that 
freedom of speech from us. 
And when you think things can’t get 
more radical around here, they do. Now 
the Democrats’ rules package takes 
out words like ‘‘mother’’ and ‘‘father’’ 
and ‘‘brother’’ and ‘‘sister.’’ In their 
quest to not offend anyone, they are of-
fending almost all of America. 
If we are going to go down this path, 
I have some suggestions to be added to 
this rules package. How about we add: 
Members who have a relationship with 
a Chinese spy should be removed from 
the 
Intelligence 
Committee. 
How 
about: Members should be punished if 
they leak classified information and 
private information after they leave 
the SCIF. How about: Members should 
be disciplined if they spread around 
false Russian collusion information. 
Of course, my Democrat colleagues 
would never dream of adding that. 
Madam Speaker, I adamantly oppose 
this rules package. 
b 1300 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, as we enter a new year, Amer-
icans are urging us to come together 
and tackle our toughest challenges, 
and that includes the costly climate 
crisis. 
In the previous Congress, the House 
directed that a Select Committee on 
the Climate Crisis develop a roadmap 
for America’s clean energy future. 
With a broad cross section of ideas and 
input, the committee developed a ma-
jority staff report that was a detailed 
roadmap for action. It was called the 
Solving the Climate Crisis plan. It has 
been described as the most well- 
thought-out plan for addressing cli-
mate change that has ever been part of 
U.S. politics, an extraordinary syn-
thesis of expertise from social and sci-
entific fields.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H28 
January 4, 2021 
Some of our recommendations have 
already been adopted into law through 
bipartisan legislation, but we have 
much more work to do. This excellent 
rules package will allow us to continue 
our work in the 117th Congress. 
Our bipartisan committee intends to 
advance clean energy solutions that 
unleash American innovation, promote 
environmental justice, and create good 
family-sustaining jobs in all commu-
nities across the country. 
I urge Members to support the rules 
package, and I thank Speaker PELOSI, 
Chairman MCGOVERN, and the Com-
mittee on Rules for their work and for 
their vision. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), my very good 
friend and a former member of the 
Committee on Rules. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
the Democrats’ proposed changes to 
the House rules will disenfranchise 
rural America, plain and simple. 
In addition to throwing out budget 
rules to make way for socialist pack-
ages like the Green New Deal, Demo-
crats are gutting the motion to recom-
mit, which is an important tool for the 
minority to make substantive amend-
ments to legislation. 
Past Republican motions to recom-
mit have included things such as re-
storing 
funding 
for 
critical 
rural 
broadband programs or allowing for ef-
fective wildfire mitigation and in-
creased funding for hazardous fuel re-
duction in our Nation’s forests, also, an 
MTR to protect our farmers and agri-
cultural employers from being sued out 
of businesses. 
Eliminating 
this 
opportunity 
to 
amend legislation further diminishes 
the voices of rural communities, and, 
frankly, Madam Speaker, it is a slap in 
the face to rural Americans. It is clear 
Speaker PELOSI’s Democratic majority, 
albeit a heck of a lot slimmer than it 
once was, is threatened by our reinvig-
orated Republican Conference. 
Rural Americans deserve better. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished chair and all 
of those who opened up their thoughts 
to this very important process. I par-
ticipated through the Progressive Cau-
cus, and I am very grateful for the 
work that included all Members. 
I believe in democracy; I believe in 
the rights of the minority; but I want 
to applaud this rules package in par-
ticular because, as a member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, I think 
extremely important is the language to 
protect whistleblowers. 
The responsibility of Congress is 
oversight, and even though this was 
not in the congressional wheelhouse, it 
was shameful what happened to Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman, a United 
States Army leader, if you will, who 
thought it was his patriotic duty sim-
ply to tell the truth. 
What happened to him as a whistle-
blower in the executive? He was fired. 
What happened to his brother, twin 
brother? No longer there. No one pro-
tected them. 
I want to applaud a Committee on 
Rules package that protects but, as 
well, a Committee on Rules package 
that also deals with diversity, gender, 
and puts America’s business first. 
Vote for this package. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), my 
very good friend and ranking Repub-
lican member of the Committee on the 
Budget. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, on only day two of 
the 117th Congress, House Democrats 
are already attempting to strip Ameri-
cans of the transparency that they de-
serve in order to push through an ex-
pensive progressive wish list. 
The House rules package includes 
three main provisions that will allow 
Democrats to hide their plans to irre-
sponsibly spend taxpayer dollars in an 
effort to satisfy their liberal base: a 
deeming resolution, signaling they do 
not plan on doing a budget; two, new, 
broad exemptions to budget rules, such 
as paygo, to allow passage of socialist 
policies with large price tags; and, 
three, they want the repeal of a House 
rule prohibiting reconciliation from in-
creasing net direct spending, making it 
easier to advance a costly radical agen-
da. 
It has been 733 days since Democrats 
took control of the House of Represent-
atives, and they have yet to produce 
one single budget. These rules will con-
tinue to let Democrats shirk their duty 
to write and pass a budget. 
Don’t forget, Speaker PELOSI is the 
one who stated the budget is a state-
ment of values. I couldn’t agree more. 
I must ask: Have Democrats not done a 
budget because they know revealing 
their true plans, their true colors, will 
let the American people know how un-
popular their ideas are? 
The people deserve to know, and they 
deserve a transparent budget to know 
how House Democrats plan to spend 
their hard-earned tax dollars and how 
Democrats 
want 
to 
increase 
their 
taxes. 
Furthermore, by weakening fiscal re-
straint rules, Democrats clearly intend 
to drastically increase the size of the 
Federal Government. This will only 
continue to drive up the unsustainable 
Federal debt while decreasing Ameri-
cans’ liberties and freedoms. 
Specifically, it includes a budgetary 
exemption for measures to prevent, 
prepare, or respond to economic, envi-
ronmental, 
or 
public 
health 
con-
sequences 
resulting 
from 
climate 
change. This exemption is irrespon-
sible, since, arguably, it could apply to 
any radical, progressive, out-of-touch 
legislation dreamed up next by House 
Democrats. Clearly, this exemption 
was designed as a mechanism to ram 
through socialist policies like the 
Green New Deal and other ideas aimed 
at hurting American workers, families, 
and farmers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, this past November, the vot-
ers rejected a socialist agenda. If this 
rules package is any indication for how 
Democrats plan to run the 117th Con-
gress, I cannot wait for the midterm 
elections. These rules allow Democrats 
to continue deceiving the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this So-
viet-style rules package. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t even know where to begin. 
Look, let me repeat, what we are 
doing is building in an exemption to 
deal with two worldwide emergencies: 
one 
is 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 
which, unfortunately, this White House 
mismanaged terribly; the second is to 
deal with the issue of the climate cri-
sis, which everybody but a few Mem-
bers in this Chamber believe is a crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I will remind the 
gentleman that he has voted for ex-
emptions when it comes to tax cuts for 
billionaires and corporations; he has 
voted for exemptions when it comes to 
taking people’s healthcare away from 
them. So, obviously, we don’t share the 
same values here, but I am very proud 
of what is in this package. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄4 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I find the protesta-
tions of our friends on the other side of 
the aisle rich, when 2 days from now 
they plan to actually vote in favor of 
overturning the results of an election 
that their party’s nominee lost. So, 
please, 
spare 
us 
the 
protestations 
about the undemocratic process that 
you are opposing here. 
Further, I rise to urge adoption of 
the rules package for the 117th Con-
gress. This package includes innovative 
proposals to modernize the House and 
facilitate good policymaking. 
It will establish the Select Com-
mittee on Economic Disparity and 
Fairness in Growth, which will work to 
combat income inequality and, criti-
cally, require committees to address 
inequities 
in 
marginalized 
commu-
nities. 
I recently proposed the creation of an 
advisory panel on equity and justice in 
Federal spending, so I am pleased that 
this package recognizes the need to dis-
mantle the effects of systemic racism 
and creates a process to address intrac-
table inequities. 
As a longtime proponent of diversity 
in hiring, I am glad we are making the 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion per-
manent. 
I am also pleased that the rules ex-
empt climate legislation from budg-
etary restrictions, clearing the way for

ambitious Federal investments to com-
bat climate change. As an appropri-
ator, I am eager to deploy the power of 
the Appropriations Committee to fight 
climate change and work toward envi-
ronmental justice. 
Finally, I applaud the inclusion of 
gender-neutral language. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Florida. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, finally, I applaud the 
inclusion of gender-neutral language 
that embraces all gender identities and 
reflects that this Chamber is not just a 
man’s world anymore. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished new Mem-
ber from the great State of Texas (Ms. 
Van Duyne), who will be making her 
first address on the House floor. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H. Res. 8. 
I came to Congress expecting to en-
gage in vigorous debate with my col-
leagues 
to 
ensure 
legislation 
was 
passed in its best form. I am ready to 
legislate with Members on both sides of 
the aisle, but the majority is not inter-
ested in bipartisan legislating or even 
permitting the free expression of ideas. 
Instead, because Republicans made his-
toric gains in the House, Democrats 
are changing the rules to limit their 
own Members from defecting. 
Since the very first Congress, the 
motion to recommit has protected the 
rights of the minority, both Republican 
and Democrat alike. 
The majority would overturn a cen-
tury’s worth of precedent by elimi-
nating the motion to recommit and 
also pave the way for reckless spending 
by forgoing critical pay-as-you-go re-
quirements to fund costly socialist 
policies. 
Finally, and most ridiculous of all, 
Democrats are banning terms like 
‘‘mother,’’ ‘‘father,’’ ‘‘daughter,’’ and 
‘‘son’’ from the House rules. 
With so many tasks and obligations 
the American people expect us to un-
dertake, this proposal demonstrates 
Democrats’ true intentions, which is to 
advance radical liberal policies that 
have no meaningful impact on the 
American public. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, 
Madam Speaker, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately 
amend the rules package to strike the 
complete gutting of the MTR. My 
amendment will restore this sacred 
right to the minority to offer a final 
amendment to the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the distin-
guished Republican leader, to discuss 
this critical amendment in more de-
tail. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, if 
we defeat the previous question, we can 
amend the rule to save the right of 
every American to be heard on the 
floor of Congress. 
Madam Speaker, a tenet of socialism 
is to silence all opposition. The right 
to speak your mind and question your 
leaders are often the first casualties of 
socialist governments throughout his-
tory; not far behind are other impor-
tant freedoms, including the right to 
defend yourself and the right to earn a 
living, which are impossible to protect 
without the freedom of speech. 
Our Constitution lists the freedom of 
speech as its very first freedom, and for 
our Founding Fathers, the reason was 
self-evident, 
as 
Benjamin 
Franklin 
once 
said: 
‘‘Without 
freedom 
of 
thought, there can be no such thing as 
wisdom; and no such thing as public 
liberty, without freedom of speech.’’ 
The very first action of this majority 
is to take it away. 
From the very beginning of this in-
stitution, we had the motion to recom-
mit to protect the minority. If you lis-
ten to Benjamin Franklin, tell me how 
the 117th Congress can have any wis-
dom or any public liberty or any free-
dom, because you deny us speech. 
b 1315 
Benjamin Franklin was right then, 
and he is right now. But I have noticed 
the dangerous trend against free speech 
in recent years, a trend that betrays 
everything our Founding Fathers lived, 
fought, and died for. 
It began in our schools on college 
campuses 
where 
our 
students 
are 
taught the absurd notion that free 
speech is about privilege and power, 
not open debate and rational delibera-
tion. 
Then it jumped to the mainstream 
media and social media giants who 
used their power to protect their lib-
eral friends and censor conservatives, 
including during the last election and 
throughout the pandemic. 
Now, with today’s vote, the same so-
cialist ideas have found their way onto 
the floor and into the rules of the U.S. 
House of Representatives, which will 
shape every law this Chamber tries to 
make in the next 2 years, taking the 
same idea that the socialist govern-
ments have taken before, the fear that 
you might lose based on an idea, so 
take their voice away. 
Whose voices are those? The con-
stituents of millions of Americans. 
These changes will stop American 
voices from being heard, primarily by 
revoking the motion to recommit, the 
minority’s longtime right to offer the 
last amendment to legislation. 
I see my good friend, the majority 
leader, across the aisle. He and I have 
switched jobs before. I was the major-
ity leader. For 8 years, never once was 
it ever debated that we would deny the 
minority the right to an amendment 
on a bill. Never once. I know the ma-
jority leader will stand up later and 
say: Well, this has been changed time 
and time again. Only by Democrats. 
I know my friend is an institution-
alist. I know he believes in this body, 
but he cannot believe about taking this 
away. 
Why would you want to? You cannot 
pass a motion to recommit on the floor 
unless you have a majority of the peo-
ple in the body to vote for it. Are you 
so afraid that you can’t hold people 
that you want to take it away? Are 
your constituents better than some-
body else’s? 
To again quote Ben Franklin, free 
speech is a necessary tool for exposing 
and keeping in check narrow thoughts 
and narrow men. That is what the MTR 
is all about. For our constituents, tak-
ing it away means freedom of speech is 
silenced and good ideas are stifled. 
While House Democrats have slowly 
chipped away at this right in the past, 
today’s vote truly represents the nu-
clear option. It will prove once and for 
all who is truly an institutionalist in 
this body. 
Is it no wonder that your majority is 
so thin that you try to take away the 
MTR? Was the Speaker vote too close? 
I can’t imagine casting that vote as 
your very first action. Additionally, 
these rules mirror the misplaced prior-
ities of the last Congress. Democrats’ 
45-page resolution strips all mention of 
the words father, mother, son, daugh-
ter, brother, mother-in-law, daughter- 
in-law. I am a proud father. I am an ex-
tremely proud son. But we are going to 
strike them from the rules. First, we 
take your speech away. Then, we take 
away what you can say. 
Already, in their race to wokeness— 
I listened to your opening prayer yes-
terday. 
They 
changed 
the 
word 
‘‘amen,’’ which has nothing to do with 
gender. 
Today’s vote is about more than or-
ganizing Congress. It is about the 
American people’s right to be heard by 
their government. This vote is impor-
tant. It might be the most important 
vote we take after the vote for Speak-
er. It signals our priorities, our vision 
for the entire 2 years. 
The fact that this is the Democrats’ 
first course of action as a majority in 
the new Congress speaks volumes to 
the lengths they will go to silence the 
people’s voice. 
I almost thought it would be the op-
posite. I know what you thought the 
day, the weeks, the months before the 
election. You wondered if you would 
have enough seats in here for how big 
your majority would be. I listened to 
the Speaker say she wasn’t going to

only win the majority; she was winning 
it for the next two or three elections 
because they were going to gain so 
many seats. My dear friend predicted a 
15-seat gain by the Democrats. But 
that is not what the American people 
told you. 
I probably would have reversed and 
said: Oh, my gosh, if we are doing ev-
erything that the American people do 
not want, maybe we should change 
course. But you actually took the op-
posite approach. 
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
Let’s deny people to even say more be-
cause they don’t like what we are 
doing. 
I have watched this happen in other 
parts of the world, but I never thought, 
in the fundamental belief of the very 
first amendment of America, of the 
very belief of this body where we de-
bate, where the voices of America are 
supposed to be heard, where an MTR 
has been around from the very begin-
ning of this Nation, of this body—but 
you will be the individuals, you will be 
the slim majority, that took it away. 
You will cast that vote. You will have 
the history written about you. 
The fact that this is your very first 
course of action, you are setting the 
tone for the next 2 years. The political 
and moral stakes are high, and the 
American people know it. 
If censorship replaces open debate on 
this floor, serious deliberation of the 
most important issues confronting our 
country will become impossible. More 
importantly, Congress will continue to 
waste time on unnecessary distractions 
that have nothing to do with the needs 
of the American people. This damage 
will be immediate and long-lasting. 
But Republicans will never give up 
our right to fully represent our con-
stituents’ voices here in Washington. 
Democrats’ small thinking may limit 
how we can do what is right for our 
constituents, but it won’t stop us from 
doing what is needed. Maybe we need a 
little history in modern history. 
You had the ability to control this 
body for 40 years before Republicans 
ever won in 1994. You had tried to shut 
it off now and then based upon certain 
bills. The very first thing that Repub-
licans did when they had the chance to 
write the rules and be in the majority, 
they guaranteed it for the minority— 
for you, when you were in the minor-
ity. They were not afraid. 
When we narrowed the majority, 
much to the same numbers we have 
today, was it removed then because Re-
publicans were in power? It was not. It 
was guaranteed. My good friend was 
here during that time. The Speaker 
served during that time. 
When we, the Republicans, took the 
majority again and had it for 8 years, 
not only did we never touch it, we 
guaranteed it again. You have been in 
power for 2 years. You lost seats based 
upon what you did on this floor. In-
stead of changing course, you now deny 
people their voice. 
That is the history that will be writ-
ten today. That is the legacy you will 
live with. I will promise you this: Two 
years from today, when you are no 
longer in the majority, we will correct 
the course of history because we are 
not afraid of ideas. We believe it makes 
us stronger. We know it makes this 
country stronger. 
This choice will shape everything we 
do in the next 2 years and beyond. We 
have big challenges. We are going to 
have to work together. But if you deny 
us, you are going to have a hard time 
working with us. 
Madam Speaker, you and I travel a 
lot back to our districts. We often fly 
on the same planes. We see our con-
stituents, and I see you listen to them. 
I see you talk to them about issues. I 
have watched you work across the aisle 
on some of the biggest issues, even 
when you were not in the majority. 
I want you to think one moment, 
Madam Speaker: What if those con-
stituents you talk to—and you say you 
will bring their voice to the floor— 
what if you were going to be denied 
that? You never were denied that when 
you were in the minority. 
But I just ask every Member of this 
body, before you cast this vote, you 
may think a tough vote goes away. Oh, 
no, it won’t. I will make you this prom-
ise: You have given me the passion to 
fight harder for my constituents. You 
have given me the passion to find a 
better opportunity for more of their 
voices to be heard. And you have given 
me the passion to win back the major-
ity so I can win back the voices on this 
floor that they won’t be denied. And 
they might not be my constituents. 
They may be the voices of your con-
stituents because it is the right thing 
to do that has been here the entire 
time this body has been here. 
Madam Speaker, there are times we 
will disagree, but there are very few 
times I have ever been this embar-
rassed of this body, the hypocrisy of 
what I am about to see, the hypocrisy 
of what you think you will defend, ev-
erybody in this body knows it is wrong. 
But you feel you can grip power a little 
harder. You feel you can hold onto it a 
little stronger. 
I will tell you this: The power of free 
speech is so much stronger than the 
power of somebody trying to grip and 
hold onto the majority. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge de-
feat of the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind all Members, includ-
ing the minority leader, of the rules of 
decorum, which say that a Member, 
Delegate, or Resident Commissioner 
who desires to speak or deliver a mat-
ter to the House shall respectfully ad-
dress the Speaker. 
This Chair intends to enforce this 
rule. It is an important rule of deco-
rum. We are entering into some dif-
ficult days, and I will tell all Members 
on both sides of the aisle: We will en-
force the rules of decorum of the 
House. 
Remarks will be made to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate the admonition here, and 
I wish the distinguished minority lead-
er would have remained because he 
talked a lot about debate, and then he 
gave a speech and ran off the floor. 
But I would be careful, I would say to 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle, about using words like ‘‘hypoc-
risy’’ because I was here when you were 
in the majority. You presided over the 
most closed Congress in the history of 
our country, more closed rules than 
any other Congress. 
The motion to recommit, arguably, is 
a procedural motion, but when you 
closed rule after rule after rule after 
rule, any substantive amendment, you 
blocked. But my friends had no prob-
lem with that at the time, and now, all 
of a sudden, they do. 
Again, I would just say to the distin-
guished minority leader, who keeps 
talking about mind control and people 
banning him from being able to say 
that he is a father or a son, I don’t 
know what he is talking about. Please 
show me in the rules package where he 
can’t say all of those things. There is 
nothing—nothing—in the rules pack-
age. 
I would just urge my colleagues—as I 
said at the beginning, I get it. The 
White House is a fact-free zone, but we 
have to aspire to be different. We can 
have our policy disagreements, but we 
shouldn’t be making things up. I mean, 
I would like to think we are better 
than that, no matter how much we dis-
agree on substantive issues. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will once again remind Members, 
if you are referring to the person you 
are debating as ‘‘you,’’ chances are you 
are violating the rule. All Members are 
asked to address all of their remarks to 
the Chair. 
b 1330 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), who is the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I will 
continue to address my remarks to you 
notwithstanding the fact that you 
ruled against me just a little while ago 
on a vote, which excited some. 
I am an institutionalist. I believe in 
this body, I believe in democracy, and 
for your information, I believe in the 
free enterprise system. 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the re-
marks of the minority leader. I lis-
tened to the outrage that he expresses. 
I share the view of the Rules Com-
mittee chairman that he was a prin-
cipal leader in the most closed Con-
gress in which I have served, which 
was, of course, presided over by my Re-
publican colleagues. He talked about 
free speech. Nothing in this rule under-
mines the free speech of any Member in 
this House—nothing. 
When they had closed rules, I didn’t 
get up and say: You are muzzling my 
speech. 
You muzzled my ability to make leg-
islation, but you did not muzzle my

speech. The First Amendment is sac-
rosanct, hopefully for everybody in this 
body. But I will tell you I have been in 
this body when Republican Members, 
Madam Speaker, rose to their feet de-
manding that people do something in 
the galleries. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to show 
hypocrisy—not from me. The gen-
tleman, the chairman of the Rules 
Committee, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
men-
tioned that the minority leader men-
tioned hypocrisy. I presume his asser-
tion was that somehow we were being 
hypocritical. I intend to speak a little 
bit of time and I intend to show hypoc-
risy. 
First of all, the gentleman is wrong 
in his facts. The motion to recommit 
was taken from the British Parliament 
and was present at the first Congress in 
1789. Interestingly enough, the motion 
to recommit was used to correct some-
thing that had not been included in the 
bill and was considered a friendly 
amendment and remained that way for 
a very, very long time. 
In 1934, it was ruled that instructions 
in a motion which were present from 
time to time was not necessary, and 
that is the way the rule maintained es-
sentially for the next 20 years—actu-
ally, excuse me, 60 years, until 1995. 
The gentleman is correct. When the 
Republicans took office for the first 
time in a very long time under the 
leadership of Newt Gingrich, Madam 
Speaker, they changed the rule. They 
said that you have to have a motion to 
instruct, as if they were giving us 
something, as if they were giving us 
something. Remember that phrase be-
cause I am going to show it meant 
nothing. It was an illusion. It was a 
pretense. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to first 
go through, of 34 examples, about 10 of 
the examples of what our Republican 
friends, Madam Speaker, said about the 
motion to recommit. 
First of all, the minority leader—I 
read from the Wichita Eagle of May 12, 
2013: ‘‘The political book on MCCARTHY 
is that he does a good job at counting 
votes, of knowing where the 233 House 
of Representatives Republicans are at 
any given time. He points out that Re-
publicans, unlike Democrats in a pre-
vious Congress, haven’t lost certain 
procedural 
votes’’—procedural 
vote. 
Let me underline procedural vote. Not 
substance of the First Amendment and 
not substance of free speech. Proce-
dural vote—‘‘called a motion to recom-
mit, that are a test of floor control.’’ 
That is what the minority leader was 
bragging about: floor control. He was 
not in the minority at that point in 
time. He was in the majority. I believe 
he was the whip. 
A subsequent—or previous to the 
present minority leader, Eric Cantor 
went on to amplify the Republican per-
spective on the motion to recommit. 
Majority Leader Eric Cantor publicly 
went on the defensive about an MTR, 
stating that the MTR was simply a 
gimmick. Eric Cantor, the majority 
leader of the Republican Party in 2012. 
Mr. Bishop, one of the ranking mem-
bers, he is no longer here. He left. He 
retired last year. Referring to an MTR, 
he said: ‘‘Mr. Speaker, this is a proce-
dural motion.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Bishop went on 
to say that it is just ‘‘another delay 
tactic.’’ Just a delay tactic. He didn’t 
say anything about the First Amend-
ment. He didn’t say anything about 
substantive consequences of the MTR. 
He said that it was a delaying tactic. 
Referring to the MTR, Representa-
tive CONAWAY said: ‘‘To come in here 
now and pull this procedural trick. . . . 
When we are in the minority, we do 
it.’’ 
He is correct. When we are in the mi-
nority, we do it. 
Madam Speaker, very frankly, I will 
tell you—and you can take my words 
down for the future—if this never came 
back, ever, it wouldn’t bother me be-
cause it is a charade of substance. It is 
a pretense of legislating. 
Representative Goodlatte, who was 
then-chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I believe, or at some subse-
quent point chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, said: ‘‘This is simply a dil-
atory tactic. . . . ‘’ 
That is what the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee—I am not sure if he 
was at that point in time in 2015. I 
think he was. 
Madam Speaker, a dilatory tactic is 
what the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee on the Republican side of 
the aisle called the MTR. It ‘‘seeks to 
distract from the urgent needs. . . . ‘’ 
Representative LAMBORN said: ‘‘Mr. 
Speaker, this motion to recommit is a 
procedural motion. . . . ‘’ 
Madam Speaker, I am sorry the 
Chamber is not full. It can’t be full. I 
would have liked to speak to all the 
Members of the Congress, and they can 
judge on the hypocrisy of the argu-
ments that are being made. 
This motion to recommit is a proce-
dural motion designed to slow down 
consideration of this important bill. It 
is purely, purely procedural. Not a lit-
tle bit procedural and a little bit sub-
stantive; it is purely procedural. 
Representative OLSON, in 2019, refer-
ring to it, said: ‘‘It fits a pattern of 
delay and obstruction that we simply 
can’t afford.’’ 
Hypocrisy. He didn’t say anything 
about its having to do with free speech. 
A motion that we were offering as an 
MTR that we thought, like you think— 
excuse me, Madam Speaker, as the Re-
publicans think, is a gotcha amend-
ment. It is politics on both sides. It is 
not substantive and it is not about free 
speech. It is about politics and gotcha. 
Yes, I am an institutionalist and, yes, 
I think we ought to not be doing 
gotcha in a nonsubstantive way. 
Madam Speaker, obviously, we dis-
agree on issues. And when we offer an 
issue and they don’t vote for it, we 
think that is politically helpful to us 
because we think it is for the people. 
They do the same thing and they think 
it is for the people. So no party is free 
of its gotcha actions. Mine is not, nor 
is theirs. 
Representative UPTON, one of the in-
stitutionalists in this body, former 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Republican from the State 
of Michigan, being kind, as FRED 
UPTON is kind, said: ‘‘I appreciate the 
motion to recommit, and I would just 
say to all my colleagues: Our side cer-
tainly views that as a procedural issue, 
not a real amendment.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I would say to the 
ladies and gentlemen of the Congress: 
Who is hypocritical? Who is hypo-
critical when their Member, a valued 
senior chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, says that this is 
a procedural issue, not a real amend-
ment? 
My goodness gracious, the Rules 
Committee is taking away not a real 
amendment. 
Isn’t that horrific? 
How could they do that, Madam 
Speaker, when the Republicans say 
that it is not a real issue, it is not sub-
stantive, it is a gimmick, and it is a de-
laying and obstruction tactic? 
Now, let me say that the Republicans 
uniformly vote against the MTR. 
Mr. Woodall was a member of the 
Rules Committee. He is no longer here. 
He is from the State of Georgia. Mr. 
Woodall said, after being here for about 
10 years of the motion to recommit, 
that he was told by the leadership 
when he started in this body that it is 
a procedural motion aimed to obstruct 
and delay, we always vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Now, let me tell you, Madam Speak-
er, what they always vote ‘‘no’’ on. On 
April 7, 2011, an MTR was offered, a 
motion to recommit that would ensure 
that our troops would get paid. The Re-
publicans defeated that motion over-
whelmingly. Only one person on the 
Republican side voted for it, Walter 
Jones. He is no longer in the Congress. 
He was pretty iconoclastic when he was 
here, and he did what he darn well 
pleased irrespective of the directions of 
the leadership who said: Always vote 
‘‘no’’ on the MTR. 
So what they are complaining about, 
Madam Speaker, is the preclusion of 
doing something they always opposed. 
And, very frankly, when they won 
those MTRs from time to time—very 
few—they then voted against the bill. 
There was no substance. 
A little while later, about a month 
later, the motion to recommit that we 
offered ensured that our top priority in 
funding our intelligence services is the 
campaign to disrupt, dismantle, and 
defeat al-Qaida and affiliated organiza-
tions. 
Raise your hand if you are opposed to 
that. Madam Speaker, not your hand. 
But our colleagues ought to reflect on 
whether they are opposed to that 
premise. Not a single Republican voted 
for that MTR—this substantive asser-
tion that our campaign and intel-
ligence services ought to be not dis-
rupted in their fight against al-Qaida 
and affiliated organizations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H32 
January 4, 2021 
A short time later we offered another 
MTR. The motion to recommit pro-
vides our troops with a $100 per month 
increase in combat pay. 
As you sit in your chairs in this 
House, or you are watching these pro-
ceedings on television, I want you to 
say to yourself: Am I against $100 for 
our troops who are at risk? 
b 1345 
Because if you are, voting against 
the MTR was justified. Every Repub-
lican save—except—one more time— 
Walter 
Jones, 
voted 
against 
that 
amendment, that substantive amend-
ment that we are stealing away from 
them, which they say we never vote 
for. 
Madam Speaker, if Mr. MCCARTHY 
were here, I would ask him: Have you 
ever voted for an MTR? 
I ask him rhetorically. Perhaps, at 
some point in time, he will tell us. 
Maybe he was against the substance of 
all of these amendments that I am 
speaking about. 
In 2012, the following year, the mo-
tion to recommit would prohibit the 
issuance of leases to any entity that is 
in violation of the Iran Sanctions Act 
or the Syrian Accountability and Leba-
nese Sovereignty Restoration Act. 
Madam Speaker, not a single Repub-
lican voted for that amendment. The 
substantive amendment that they are 
so aggrieved—and by the way, ener-
gizing their party to be more partisan 
than they ought to be doing. We ought 
to all praise DON YOUNG, the dean of 
the House. He served here longer than 
anybody else. He said yesterday that 
we ought to come together and reach 
out our hands to one another and make 
this place work for the people. 
Another motion to recommit would 
prohibit export of helium from the 
Federal Helium Reserve to Iran, North 
Korea, and Syria. 
Madam Speaker, not a single Repub-
lican voted for that MTR. Why? Be-
cause it is procedural. It is a gimmick. 
It is obstructing. That is what we are 
taking away that you are so aggrieved 
at. 
Now, I have about 35 or 40 of these. 
The good news is, I am not going to 
read them all. But in 2014, the motion 
to recommit would ensure that the in-
telligence 
community 
continues 
to 
protect the United States—hear me— 
from Chinese and other state-sponsored 
computer theft. I am sure all of you 
will say, ‘‘Well, I am against that. That 
is an awful thing to do.’’ But everyone 
on that side of the aisle in the Congress 
today voted against that amendment. 
Our new Members didn’t vote against 
it, obviously, but people who were here, 
every Republican that was here, voted 
‘‘no’’ on protecting ourselves from the 
Chinese, the theft of our computer 
technology. 
Madam Speaker, the next year, 2015— 
and I am just taking a couple from 
each year—the motion to recommit 
would deter terrorist cyberattacks, 
homegrown 
terrorist 
attacks, 
and 
strengthen America’s cybersecurity by 
increasing prevention efforts to stop 
the recruitment and travel of home-
grown terrorists by ISIL, al-Qaida, and 
other terrorist organizations. 
Now, I know you are going to be 
shocked because you are probably 
thinking, ‘‘Oh, of course we voted for 
that.’’ Not one. Not a single Repub-
lican voted for that MTR. 
So, this aggrieved rhetoric that we 
hear about taking something away, the 
only thing being taken away is their 
gotcha opportunities and ours. 
Now, in the majority, you don’t have 
the motion to recommit. I get that. 
But we may be in the minority at some 
point in time. Don’t give it back to us 
because it is a political game that un-
dermines the integrity of this institu-
tion, and it is covered as a gotcha 
game, for the most part, by the press 
and media that knows what that is—a 
game. 
Madam Speaker, in 2015, the motion 
to recommit would require the Depart-
ment 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
to 
prioritize protection and technical as-
sistance to stop cyberattacks on crit-
ical infrastructure, such as the electric 
power grid and nuclear power plants. 
By now, you know what I am going 
to say. Only one Republican voted for 
that. It won’t surprise you that it was 
Walter Jones because Walter Jones 
really did treat it as a substantive 
piece of legislation. 
But the party that is so aggrieved 
today instructs their Republican fresh-
men and all of their Members: Vote 
‘‘no’’ on the MTR. 
Madam Speaker, I am available to 
yield to anybody who is going to tell 
me that is not the truth. Nobody has 
propounded that question to me. 
In 2015, again, a month later, the mo-
tion to recommit would protect troop 
pay, guaranteeing a pay increase of 2.3 
percent for our servicemembers and en-
suring no lapse in troop pay in the 
event of a government shutdown. And 
there was my friend, standing tall— 
Walter Jones, alone but standing tall. 
Not a single other Republican voted for 
that. 
Just three left. 
Madam Speaker, in 2017, I am bring-
ing you up to date because this has 
been a consistent pattern. This is not 
some ‘‘one person said this; one person 
said that.’’ It is a consistent pattern of 
Republicans dismissing the motion to 
recommit as not of substance, only a 
delay tactic, a gimmick, if you will, ac-
cording to Mr. Cantor. 
The motion to recommit, in Novem-
ber 2017, to ensure rural communities 
have adequate funding for educational 
services, conservation projects, and 
fire prevention programs. 
Madam Speaker, now, Walter Jones 
got a friend on this one, Rod Blum, who 
is no longer here. And, tragically, Mr. 
Jones died too early. They are not 
here, but they thought that was a good 
idea. No other Republican thought that 
was a good idea. 
In 2018, just 2 years ago, the motion 
to recommit would amend the under-
lying bill to prohibit the Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy from chartering a private plane or 
flying any class above coach. That was 
because a couple of Secretaries clearly 
did not meet their responsibilities to 
the American taxpayer in the expendi-
tures of moneys in their Departments. 
Again, Mr. Blum and Mr. Jones 
thought that was a good idea, but the 
Republican leadership had instructed 
them, you will recall, according to Mr. 
Woodall, to vote ‘‘no’’ because this is 
just a delaying tactic. This is just a 
game. Vote ‘‘no.’’ It is procedural. It is 
not substance. 
Lastly—and people are now saying 
amen—the motion to recommit would 
ensure, in this case, that we would: 
protect students and children from a 
person who has been convicted of a sex 
offense against a minor; secondly, pre-
vent domestic violence; thirdly, pre-
vent rape or sexual assault; or four, re-
quire criminal background checks for 
schools or other employment. 
Rod Blum and Walter Jones stayed 
true to themselves and did not follow 
the instruction: This is a game. This is 
an obstruction. This is a gimmick. This 
is a way to delay and defeat. 
Madam Speaker, I have taken some 
time to discuss this because I don’t 
like hypocrisy. I don’t like wasting 
time. I don’t like not respecting one 
another and playing a gotcha game to 
see if you guys are afraid of this 
amendment. And then when we adopt 
the amendment, if we adopt, a very 
few—vote against the bill because, 
after all, it was just a political game. 
We don’t like the bill, no matter what 
you have in it. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this rule. Madam Speaker, the 
people who are watching this debate 
may not have the knowledge that all of 
us have. Almost invariably—almost in-
variably—this is a partisan vote. The 
Republicans will vote against our rule, 
and we will vote against their rule. 
And, invariably, we will find some 
problem with it that we can rationalize 
our vote on. 
Madam Speaker, I regret that we are 
starting this Congress—and I am going 
to look at Mr. Ryan’s speech. I am 
going to look at Mr. Hastert’s speech 
on the opening day. I am going to look 
at all the Speakers with whom I have 
served and see what their comments 
were on the opening day. 
I regretted the minority leader’s 
opening statement. I regretted it be-
cause, as DON YOUNG said, we need to 
come together. We are at a time of pan-
demic. We are at a time of economic 
distress. We ought to be acting not for 
ourselves, not for our politics, but for 
our people. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge every 
Member to vote for this rule. And as 
they do so, be assured they are not 
denigrating or denying anybody’s free 
speech any more than the Republicans 
denied free speech in the most closed 
Congress in our history just a few years 
ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H33 
January 4, 2021 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. OBERNOLTE), one 
of our new Members. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 
although I share the concerns that 
have been raised about the MTR, I 
would like to speak on an aspect of this 
rules package that I find equally trou-
bling, and that is the provision that 
would upend nearly 30 years of House 
tradition in exempting any legislation 
that can be tied in any way to either 
response to climate change or response 
to the coronavirus crisis from the re-
quirements of paygo—in other words, 
the requirement that we consider how 
to pay for solutions to these problems 
in addition to how we solve these prob-
lems. 
Now, admittedly, climate change and 
coronavirus are serious issues, but it 
would be irresponsible to, when debat-
ing these issues, not consider their ef-
fects on the national debt and the 
budget deficit, which are also very seri-
ous issues. In fact, the CBO says that 
for the first time, last year, since 
World War II, our national debt exceed-
ed 100 percent of our gross domestic 
product. 
To fail to consider solutions that we 
debate in this Chamber, the effects of 
those solutions on those also serious 
problems, would be an abdication of 
our responsibility to our constituents. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY), my very good 
friend. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to say that we 
had this great speech by the leader of 
the Democrat Party about debates and 
about what we should do in debating on 
this floor. When will we debate? That is 
the question. When will we actually de-
bate? 
The leader made good points about 
previous rules, about closed debate. We 
haven’t had an open debate on an 
amendment on this floor since May 
2016, where I can come down as a Re-
publican Member or as a Democratic 
Member and offer an amendment. 
We have no debates on amendments 
anymore, Mr. Leader. You know this is 
true. You have been here. You have 
seen the change in this body. And I 
would just suggest—that I address my 
remarks to the Chair—I would just sug-
gest that we should have debate. That 
is what we are here to do. 
Madam Speaker, I reject this rules 
package. I have problems with it for 
the reasons my colleagues already ar-
ticulated, but I think we should engage 
in colloquy. Let’s actually have a de-
bate about setting up rules so this body 
is filled with Members offering amend-
ments and doing what the people want 
us to do. This rules package, respect-
fully, does not do that. 
b 1400 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN), my very good 
friend and the distinguished ranking 
member of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
let me be very clear: This rules pack-
age is horrible. It is a progressive af-
front to America. 
The rules package continues proxy 
voting and remote hearing measures, 
even though Members of Congress and 
staff now have access to the COVID–19 
vaccine. If Congress can be first in line 
for the vaccine, then we must be first 
to go back to work. 
Exactly how far Democrats intend to 
take their attack on free speech is un-
clear, but look no further than the ex-
tremism in the opening prayer yester-
day that concluded with ‘‘amen, and a 
woman,’’ which, quite simply, is illit-
erate and has nothing to do with gen-
der. 
This package paves the way for 
Democrats to spend unlimited dollars 
to promote a climate agenda that will 
harm rural America and our economy 
while doing nothing to create a clean-
er, safer, and healthier environment. 
Republicans want a better environment 
and economy, and this rules package 
will facilitate harm to both. 
I urge all of my colleagues, Repub-
lican and Democrat, to vote against 
this resolution. We can do better than 
neglecting our responsibility to show 
up in person. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we can do better than wasting taxpayer 
money 
on 
idealistic, 
political 
environmentalism. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me just refer the gentleman to the Of-
fice of the Attending Physician to get 
the most up-to-date medical guidance. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. POSEY). 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, in addi-
tion to all of the evils of the new rules 
package, as you have already heard, 
eliminating the comparative print re-
quirement is the single biggest damage 
you can do to transparency and ac-
countability in this House. 
The comparative print requirement 
was a top priority of the bipartisan Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization 
of Congress, a number one, top priority 
of the bipartisan committee. Every 
State in the country that I know of 
uses comparative print. It shows you 
clearly what language in the bill actu-
ally changes the law. States can do it, 
but this great U.S. House of Represent-
atives just can’t seem to do it. 
It is an absolutely shameful thing, 
and I urge Members of the House to op-
pose this horrible rules package that 
destroys transparency and account-
ability. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I want to urge all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rules 
package. 
The 
majority’s 
proposed 
package will only continue the ongoing 
assault on minority voices. 
The changes in this package com-
pletely gut the MTR. With all due re-
spect to my friends, we disagree on 
that. I am sorry you have a hard time 
handling it or getting your Members to 
where you want them to go, but the 
fact is, eight times in the last Con-
gress, Democrats joined with Repub-
licans in deciding that the Republican 
proposal improved the bill. It is that 
simple. 
We shouldn’t be taking that away, 
particularly when the record, I think, 
is so bad in the last Democratic Con-
gress in granting amendment opportu-
nities to the minority. 
I remind my friends, when we were in 
the majority, you got 45 percent of all 
of the amendments made in order in 
the Rules Committee; the Republicans 
got 38 percent; the remainder were bi-
partisan. Last time, you got two-thirds 
of the amendments, we got 18 percent, 
and the remainder were bipartisan. 
When you are removing the MTR, on 
top of not giving us very many amend-
ments to begin with, we look on that 
as an effort to limit our ability to par-
ticipate openly and effectively in de-
bate. This rules package moves us in 
another direction. 
I am sorry that the traditional rules 
of the House that have been here over 
100 years are inconvenient to the 
Democratic majority. Sometimes it is 
good to be inconvenienced when you 
are in the majority. 
You are limiting our ability to par-
ticipate. Frankly, it will find other 
outlets; it always does. I think that is 
a tragic mistake I think that you will 
live to regret. 
In addition to that, obviously, we dis-
agree in the proposed rules package 
with eliminating paygo in some crit-
ical areas. We think you could drive a 
truck through those. It is a critical 
budgetary tool, and we do think it will 
be missed, and its absence will be used 
to pave the way for the Green New 
Deal. 
In addition, the desire to continue to 
subpoena Presidents, Vice Presidents, 
and White House staff that are no 
longer in office strikes us as clearly an 
effort to just continue to harass the de-
parting administration. I regret that. I 
think you will, too. I think people 
want us to look forward, not backward. 
So we don’t see much use in that, nor 
do we see the automatic ability to re-
submit subpoenas from the last Con-
gress as a good thing. Again, it is look-
ing in the rearview mirror.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H34 
January 4, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge rejection of 
the package, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I think this is a good rules package. 
As I said at the beginning, it reflects 
consultation with Democrats and Re-
publicans; almost every caucus that 
you can think of was consulted on this. 
I think the end product is a quality 
product. 
I am particularly proud of the ethics 
reforms banning Members who have 
been convicted of corruption, pro-
tecting 
whistleblowers and making 
sure that their identities can’t be re-
vealed. 
I am proud of the creation of the Se-
lect Committee on Economic Disparity 
and Fairness in Growth. One of the 
things this pandemic has demonstrated 
is that there are great disparities in 
this country, and those disparities ex-
isted even before the pandemic. We 
need to address that issue. 
In terms of the exemptions for paygo, 
I mean, we are talking about two inter-
national, worldwide emergencies: the 
coronavirus pandemic and the climate 
crisis. I think every country in the 
world has recognized that they are 
emergencies, that we need to think big 
and boldly in how we deal with these 
issues. 
The unfortunate thing is we have had 
an administration that has not handled 
the pandemic appropriately, and as we 
gather today, well over 350,000 people, 
fellow citizens, have perished. 
Let me just say, also, Madam Speak-
er, that I was also inspired by the re-
marks of our Republican colleague DON 
YOUNG, yesterday, when he talked 
about the need to work together. I was 
dismayed by the tone of the minority 
leader’s comments on the opening day. 
In all of my years here, I have never 
heard anything quite so negative and 
combative. 
But here is the deal: We need to fig-
ure out a way to work together to get 
things done. You don’t have to agree 
on everything to agree on something. 
The something we agree on, we ought 
to move forward. We can fight about 
the other stuff. 
If we are going to get things done, 
facts have to matter. 
I have got to be honest with you: In 
listening to the critiques of this rules 
package, one of the things that I found 
particularly disheartening was the dis-
tortions and, quite frankly, the false-
hoods with regard to getting our rules 
language to be more inclusive. I don’t 
understand why it was necessary for 
some to try to make things up. It does 
not entice the kind of collaboration 
and the kind of cooperation to get that 
something done. 
I am a great fan of my ranking mem-
ber, Mr. COLE. This will probably get 
him in trouble, but I think he is one of 
the finest Members of this institution. 
We work together very well in the 
Rules 
Committee, 
notwithstanding 
some very, very difficult debates. But 
at the end of the day, I know he cares 
deeply about this institution. I know 
people like DON YOUNG care about this 
institution, and there are good Mem-
bers on the other side who care about 
this institution. 
We have a slim majority here. If we 
are going to get anything done, if you 
are going to get anything done, we are 
going to have to find a way to work 
things out. But we have to all agree 
that we want to get things done. 
So it is in that spirit that I hope that 
this rules package will cultivate the 
kind of atmosphere in which we can get 
some important things done. Whether 
it is on the climate crisis, whether it is 
on economic disparity, whether it is 
fighting to end hunger in this country, 
whether it is to make sure we can ex-
pand healthcare protections for people, 
whether it is about justice and fairness 
in this country, we have a lot of work 
to do. 
I hope, with the new administration 
coming in, that maybe there will be a 
different tone. Maybe it will be less 
combative. Maybe the discussions will 
be based more on fact. I hope and I 
pray that that is the case. But we have 
to come together, and we have to get 
things done for the American people. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H. Res. 8, which establishes House 
rules for the 117th Congress. This package 
contains many strong reforms I support, in-
cluding ones that prioritize ethics and account-
ability, promote diversity and inclusion, and 
embrace technology, including a provision I re-
quested that expands machine-readability of 
House documents. 
On October 1, 2020, I testified at the Rules 
Committee about the need for the House to 
continue the progress we’ve made in expand-
ing what legislative materials and House docu-
ments are available in machine-readable for-
mats. Today, bills and resolutions are posted 
to congress.gov in a machine-readable format, 
however, materials for markups are posted on-
line as PDFs, and sometimes they are not 
even searchable PDFs. 
Why does this matter? If we receive amend-
ments in the nature of a substitute 24 hours 
before marking up lengthy bills, we cannot 
compare amendments to original bills without 
manually reading documents line-by-line or in-
vesting in expensive software. This is also 
prohibitive to public interest groups, stake-
holders, and members of the public that wish 
to follow the legislative process. With ma-
chine-readable formats, Members, staff, and 
any interested party can easily analyze 
amendments and any other House document. 
I’m pleased to see that Section 3(j) directs 
the Committee on House Administration, the 
Clerk, and relevant House offices to take fur-
ther steps to publish House documents in ma-
chine-readable formats and enabling staff to 
create comparative prints. 
This is critical for Members wishing to ana-
lyze legislation before us, but the move is just 
as important for the sake of public trans-
parency. Public interest groups that advocate 
for government transparency have long called 
for all government documents to be available 
in machine readable formats because it en-
ables informed analysis and engagement. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN for including 
my suggestion in the proposed House rules 
package for the 117th Congress that we are 
considering today, and I urge my colleagues 
to support the legislation. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
my opposition to the Democrats’ Rules Pack-
age for the 117th Congress. 
In the November 2020 House elections, 
many of the moderate voices in the Demo-
cratic Caucus were ousted in favor of Con-
servative values. 
Now free of moderate or reasonable voices, 
the shrill progressives seized the opportunity 
to make their party even more radical—this 
Rules package is proof. 
They’re attacking the First Amendment by 
changing our use of gender specific pro-
nouns—even ending prayers with ‘‘Amen and 
Awomen’’. 
They’re eliminating the minority’s ability to 
amend legislation—something Congress has 
allowed for more than 100 years—because 
they’re embarrassed when their own members 
publicly join Republicans to rein in their laugh-
able, tone-deaf policies. 
These changes are not about fairness or 
good governance. They’re about saving their 
own members from tough votes and account-
ability. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 8 OFFERED 
BY MR. COLE OF OKLAHOMA 
Strike Section 2(s). 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 217, nays 
204, not voting 8, as follows:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair announces the Speaker’s designa-
tion on January 4, 2021, of a ‘‘covered 
period’’ pursuant to section 3(s) of 
H. Res. 8. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair customarily takes this occasion 
at the outset of a Congress to announce 
policies with respect to particular as-
pects of the legislative process. The 
Chair will insert in the RECORD an-
nouncements concerning: 
First, privileges of the floor; 
Second, introduction of bills and res-
olutions; 
Third, unanimous-consent requests 
for the consideration of legislation; 
Fourth, 
recognition 
for 
1-minute 
speeches; 
Fifth, recognition for Special Order 
speeches; 
Sixth, decorum in debate; 
Seventh, conduct of votes by elec-
tronic device; 
Eighth, use of handouts on the House 
floor; 
Ninth, use of electronic equipment on 
the House floor; and 
Tenth, use of the Chamber. 
These announcements, where appro-
priate, will reiterate the origins of the 
stated policies. The Chair intends to 
continue in the 117th Congress the poli-
cies reflected in these statements. 
The policy announced in the 102nd 
Congress with respect to jurisdictional 
concepts related to clauses 5(a) of rule 
XXI—tax 
and 
tariff 
measures—will 
continue to govern but need not be re-
iterated, as it is adequately docu-
mented as precedent in the House 
Rules and Manual. 
Without objection, the announce-
ments will be printed in the RECORD. 
There was no objection. 
Privileges of the Floor 
The Chair will make the following an-
nouncements 
regarding 
floor 
privileges, 
which will apply during the 117th Congress. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO STAFF 
Rule IV strictly limits those persons to 
whom the privileges of the floor during ses-
sions of the House are extended, and that 
rule prohibits the Chair from entertaining 
requests for suspension or waiver of that 
rule. As reiterated by the Chair on January 
21, 1986, January 3, 1985, January 25, 1983, and 
August 22, 1974, and as stated in Chapter 10, 
section 2, of House Practice, the rule strictly 
limits the number of committee staff on the 
floor at one time during the consideration of 
measures reported from their committees. 
This permission does not extend to Members’ 
personal staff except when a Member’s 
amendment is actually pending during the 
five-minute rule. It also does not extend to 
personal staff of Members who are sponsors 
of pending bills. The Chair requests the co-
operation of all Members and committee 
staff to assure that only the proper number 
of staff are on the floor, and then only dur-
ing the consideration of measures within the 
jurisdiction of their committees. The Chair 
is making this statement and reiterating 
this policy because of Members’ past insist-
ence upon strict enforcement of the rule. The 
Chair requests each committee chair, and 
each ranking minority member, to submit to 
the Speaker a list of those staff who are al-
lowed on the floor during the consideration 
of a measure in the jurisdiction of their com-
mittee. The Sergeant-at-Arms, who has been 
directed to assure proper enforcement of rule 
IV, will keep the list. Each staff person 
should exchange their ID for a ‘‘committee 
staff’’ badge, which is to be worn while on 
the floor. The Chair has consulted, and will 
continue to consult with, the Minority Lead-
er. Furthermore, as the Chair announced on 
January 7, 2003, in accordance with the 
change in the 108th Congress of clause 2(a) of 
rule IV regarding leadership staff floor ac-
cess, only designated staff approved by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H39 
January 4, 2021 
Speaker shall be granted the privilege of the 
floor. The Speaker intends that this approval 
be narrowly granted on a bipartisan basis to 
staff from the majority and minority side 
and only to those staff essential to floor ac-
tivities. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO FORMER MEMBERS 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Feb-
ruary 1, 2006, will continue to apply in the 
117th Congress. The House has adopted a re-
vision to the rule regarding the admission to 
the floor and the rooms leading thereto. 
Clause 4 of rule IV provides that a former 
Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner 
or a former Parliamentarian of the House, or 
a former elected officer of the House or a 
former minority employee nominated as an 
elected officer of the House shall not be enti-
tled to the privilege of admission to the Hall 
of the House and the rooms extending there-
to if they are a registered lobbyist or an 
agent of a foreign principal; have any direct 
personal pecuniary interest in any legisla-
tive measure pending before the House, or re-
ported by a committee; are in the employ of 
or represents any party or organization for 
the purpose of influencing, directly or indi-
rectly, the passage, defeat, or amendment of 
any legislative proposal; or have been con-
victed by a court of record for the commis-
sion of a crime in relation to that individ-
ual’s election to, or service in, the House. 
This restriction extends not only to the 
House floor but adjacent rooms, the cloak-
rooms and the Speaker’s lobby. Clause 4 of 
rule IV also allows the Speaker to exempt 
ceremonial and educational functions from 
the restrictions of this clause. These restric-
tions shall not apply to attendance at joint 
meetings or joint sessions, Former Members’ 
Day proceedings, educational tours, and 
other occasions as the Speaker may des-
ignate. Members who have reason to know 
that a person is on the floor inconsistent 
with clause 4 of rule IV should notify the 
Sergeant-at-Arms promptly. 
2. Introduction of Bills and Resolutions 
The policy that the Chair announced on 
April 6, 2020, with respect to the introduction 
of bills and resolutions will apply perma-
nently in the 117th Congress. All floor docu-
ments—including bills, resolutions, co-spon-
sor forms, constitutional authority state-
ments, general leave statements, and exten-
sions of remarks—may be submitted elec-
tronically to a dedicated and secure email 
system, or delivered by hand to staff in the 
Speaker’s Lobby or Cloakrooms. Electronic 
and hand-delivered submissions will be ac-
cepted when the House is in session, as well 
as 15 minutes immediately before and after. 
Members and staff should reference addi-
tional detailed guidance from the Clerk’s Of-
fice regarding where and how to submit ma-
terials electronically. 
The policy that the Chair announced on 
January 3, 1983, with respect to the introduc-
tion and reference of bills and resolutions 
will continue to apply in the 117th Congress. 
The Chair has advised all officers and em-
ployees of the House who are involved in the 
processing of bills that every bill, resolution, 
memorial, petition or other material that is 
placed in the hopper must bear the signature 
of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is 
jointly sponsored, the signature must be 
that of the Member first named thereon. The 
bill clerk is instructed to return to the Mem-
ber any bill which appears in the hopper 
without an original signature. This proce-
dure was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It 
has worked well, and the Chair thinks that it 
is essential to continue this practice to en-
sure the integrity of the process by which 
legislation is introduced in the House. The 
Chair has noted a need for increased atten-
tion to detail regarding the addition of co-
sponsors to measures to ensure accuracy. To 
that end, Members are encouraged to use the 
template provided by the Office of the Clerk, 
which requests Members seeking to be added 
as cosponsors to include their printed name, 
original signature, and state. Members rou-
tinely include their original signatures, 
states, and districts when voting by card in 
the well, so the Chair is hopeful that the in-
clusion of such information on a cosponsor 
form will be a familiar task. Under this pol-
icy, original signatures may include those in 
electronic form. 
3. Unanimous-Consent Requests for the Consid-
eration of Legislation 
The policy the Chair announced on Janu-
ary 6, 1999, with respect to recognition for 
unanimous consent requests for the consider-
ation of certain legislative measures will 
continue to apply in the 117th Congress. The 
Speaker will continue to follow the guide-
lines recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual conferring recognition for 
unanimous-consent requests for the consid-
eration of bills, resolutions, and other meas-
ures only when assured that the majority 
and minority floor leadership and the rel-
evant committee chairs and ranking minor-
ity members have no objection. Consistent 
with those guidelines and with the Chair’s 
inherent power of recognition under clause 2 
of rule XVII, the Chair, and any occupant of 
the chair appointed as Speaker pro tempore 
pursuant to clause 8 of rule I, will decline 
recognition for the unanimous-consent re-
quests chronicled in section 956 without as-
surances that the request has been so 
cleared. This denial of recognition by the 
Chair will not reflect necessarily any per-
sonal opposition on the part of the Chair to 
orderly consideration of the matter in ques-
tion, but will reflect the determination upon 
the part of the Chair that orderly procedures 
will be followed; that is, procedures involv-
ing consultation and agreement between 
floor and committee leadership on both sides 
of the aisle. 
4. Recognition for One-Minute Speeches 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO ONE-MINUTE SPEECHES 
The Speaker’s policy announced on August 
8, 1984, with respect to recognition for one- 
minute speeches will apply during the 117th 
Congress. The Chair will alternate recogni-
tion for one minute speeches between major-
ity and minority Members, in the order in 
which they seek recognition in the well 
under present practice from the Chair’s right 
to the Chair’s left, with possible exceptions 
for Members of the leadership and Members 
having business requests. The Chair, of 
course, reserves the right to limit one- 
minute speeches to a certain period of time 
or to a special place in the program on any 
given day, with notice to the leadership. In 
addition, during the 117th Congress, the 
Chair will continue the practice of not recog-
nizing Members for a one minute speech 
more than one time per legislative day. 
5. Recognition for Special-Order Speeches 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO SPECIAL-ORDER SPEECHES 
The Speaker’s policy with regard to spe-
cial-order speeches announced on February 
11, 1994, as clarified and reiterated by subse-
quent Speakers, will continue to apply in the 
117th Congress. The Chair may recognize 
Members for special-order speeches for up to 
4 hours. Such speeches may not extend be-
yond the 4-hour limit without the permission 
of the Chair, which may be granted only 
with advance consultation between the lead-
erships and notification to the House. How-
ever, the Chair will not recognize for any 
special-order speeches beyond 10 o’clock in 
the evening. The 4-hour limitation will be di-
vided between the majority and minority 
parties. Each party is entitled to reserve its 
first hour for respective leaderships or their 
designees. The second hour reserved to each 
party will be divided into two 30-minute peri-
ods. Recognition for one-hour periods and for 
30-minute periods will alternate initially and 
subsequently between the parties each day. 
The Chair wishes to clarify for Members that 
any 60- or 30-minute period that is not 
claimed at the appropriate time will be con-
sidered to have expired; this includes the 
first 60-minute period of the day. The alloca-
tion of time within each party’s 2-hour pe-
riod (or shorter period if prorated to end by 
10 p.m.) will be determined by a list sub-
mitted to the Chair by the respective leader-
ships. Members may not sign up with their 
leadership for any special-order speeches ear-
lier than one week prior to the special order. 
Additionally, Members must sign up with 
their leadership for any special-order speech 
at least one day prior to the special order. 
The Chair will not recognize a Member for 
more than one special-order speech per week, 
nor may a Member sign up for a second spe-
cial-order speech in the same week. Addi-
tional guidelines may be established for such 
sign-ups by the respective leaderships. Pur-
suant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the television 
cameras will not pan the Chamber, but a 
‘‘crawl’’ indicating the conduct of morning- 
hour debate or that the House has completed 
its legislative business and is proceeding 
with special-order speeches will appear on 
the screen. The Chair may announce other 
adaptations during this period. The continu-
ation of this format for recognition by the 
Speaker is without prejudice to the Speak-
er’s ultimate power of recognition under 
clause 2 of rule XVII and includes the ability 
to withdraw recognition for longer special- 
order speeches should circumstances war-
rant. 
6. Decorum in Debate 
Although clause 5 of rule XVII prohibits 
Members from wearing hats on the floor of 
the House, the Speaker intends to continue 
to apply discretion in enforcing this prohibi-
tion in the case of hats or other head cov-
erings worn for reasons of medical necessity. 
In addition, the Chair’s announced policies of 
January 7, 2003, January 4, 1995, and January 
3, 1991, will apply in the 117th Congress. It is 
essential that the dignity of the proceedings 
of the House be preserved, not only to assure 
that the House conducts its business in an 
orderly fashion but also to permit Members 
to properly comprehend and participate in 
the business of the House. To this end, and in 
order to permit the Chair to understand and 
to correctly put the question on the numer-
ous requests that are made by Members, the 
Chair requests that Members and others who 
have the privileges of the floor desist from 
audible conversation in the Chamber while 
the business of the House is being conducted. 
The Chair would encourage all Members to 
review rule XVII to gain a better under-
standing of the proper rules of decorum ex-
pected of them, and especially: to avoid 
‘‘personalities’’ in debate with respect to ref-
erences to other Members, the Senate, and 
the President; to address the Chair only dur-
ing, and not beyond, the time recognized, 
and not to address the television or other 
imagined audience; to refrain from passing 
between the Chair and a Member speaking, 
or directly in front of a Member speaking 
from the well; to refrain from smoking in the 
Chamber; to wear appropriate business attire 
in the Chamber; and to generally display the 
same degree of respect to the Chair and 
other Members that every Member is due. 
The Chair would like all Members to be on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H40 
January 4, 2021 
notice that the Chair intends to strictly en-
force time limitations on debate. Further-
more, the Chair has the authority to imme-
diately interrupt Members in debate who 
transgress rule XVII by failing to avoid ‘‘per-
sonalities’’ in debate with respect to ref-
erences to the Senate, the President, and 
other Members, rather than wait for Mem-
bers to complete their remarks. Finally, it is 
not in order to speak disrespectfully of the 
Speaker; and under the precedents the sanc-
tions for such violations transcend the ordi-
nary requirements for timeliness of chal-
lenges. This separate treatment is recorded 
in volume 2 of Hinds’ Precedents, at section 
1248 and was reiterated on January 19, 1995. 
7. Conduct of Votes by Electronic Device 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 4, 1995, with respect to the conduct of 
electronic votes will continue in the 117th 
Congress with modifications as follows. As 
Members are aware, clause 2(a) of rule XX 
provides that Members shall have not less 
than 15 minutes in which to answer an ordi-
nary record vote or quorum call. The rule ob-
viously establishes 15 minutes as a min-
imum. Still, with the cooperation of the 
Members, a vote can easily be completed in 
that time. The events of October 30, 1991, 
stand out as proof of this point. On that oc-
casion, the House was considering a bill in 
the Committee of the Whole under a special 
rule that placed an overall time limit on the 
amendment process, including the time con-
sumed by record votes. The Chair announced, 
and then strictly enforced, a policy of clos-
ing electronic votes as soon as possible after 
the guaranteed period of 15 minutes. Mem-
bers appreciated and cooperated with the 
Chair’s enforcement of the policy on that oc-
casion. The Chair desires that the example of 
October 30, 1991, be made the regular practice 
of the House. To that end, the Chair enlists 
the assistance of all Members in avoiding the 
unnecessary loss of time in conducting the 
business of the House. The Chair encourages 
all Members to depart for the Chamber 
promptly upon the appropriate bell and light 
signal. As in recent Congresses, the cloak-
rooms should not forward to the Chair re-
quests to hold a vote by electronic device, 
but should simply apprise inquiring Members 
of the time remaining on the voting clock. 
Members should not rely on signals relayed 
from outside the Chamber to assume that 
votes will be held open until they arrive in 
the Chamber. Members will be given a rea-
sonable amount of time in which to accu-
rately record their votes, and the Chair will 
endeavor to assess the presence of the mem-
bership and the expectation of further votes 
prior to exercising the authority under 
clause 9 of rule XX or clause 6(g) of rule 
XVIII. The Speaker believes the best prac-
tice for presiding officers is to await the 
Clerk’s certification that a vote tally is com-
plete and accurate. Members are further re-
minded, in accordance with the Speaker’s 
statement of January 7, 2016, that the stand-
ard policy is to not terminate the vote when 
a Member is in the well attempting to cast a 
vote. Other efforts to hold the vote open are 
not similarly protected. The Chair also rec-
ognizes that the enforcement of this policy 
will be modified during the pendency of a 
covered period pursuant to section 3(s) of 
House Resolution 8. 
8. Use of Handouts on House Floor 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Sep-
tember 27, 1995, which was prompted by a 
misuse of handouts on the House floor and 
made at the bipartisan request of the Com-
mittee on Standards of Official Conduct, will 
continue in the 117th Congress. All handouts 
distributed on or adjacent to the House floor 
by Members during House proceedings must 
bear the name of the Member authorizing 
their distribution. In addition, the content of 
those materials must comport with stand-
ards of propriety applicable to words spoken 
in debate or inserted in the Record. Failure 
to comply with this admonition may con-
stitute a breach of decorum and may give 
rise to a question of privilege. The Chair 
would also remind Members that, pursuant 
to clause 5 of rule IV, staff is prohibited from 
engaging in efforts in the Hall of the House 
or rooms leading thereto to influence Mem-
bers with regard to the legislation being 
amended. Staff cannot distribute handouts. 
In order to enhance the quality of debate in 
the House, the Chair would ask Members to 
minimize the use of handouts. 
9. Use of Electronic Equipment on House Floor 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 27, 2000, as clarified on January 6, 2009, 
and as modified by the change in clause 5 of 
rule XVII in the 112th Congress, will con-
tinue in the 117th Congress with modifica-
tions as follows. All Members and staff are 
reminded of the absolute prohibition con-
tained in clause 5 of rule XVII against the 
use of mobile electronic devices that impair 
decorum. Those devices include wireless tele-
phones and personal computers. The Chair 
wishes to note that electronic tablet devices 
do not constitute personal computers within 
the meaning of this policy and thus may be 
unobtrusively used in the Chamber. No de-
vice may be used for still photography or for 
audio or video recording or for live broad-
casting. The Chair requests all Members and 
staff wishing to receive or make wireless 
telephone calls to do so outside of the Cham-
ber. The Chair further requests that all 
Members and staff refrain from wearing tele-
phone headsets in the Chamber and to de-
activate any audible ring of wireless phones 
before entering the Chamber. To this end, 
the Chair insists upon the cooperation of all 
Members and staff and instructs the Ser-
geant-at-Arms, pursuant to clause 3(a) of 
rule II and clause 5 of rule XVII, to enforce 
this prohibition. In light of the changes to 
rule II and rule XVII in the 115th Congress, 
the Chair would like to take this oppor-
tunity to educate all Members and staff on 
how these changes will be implemented. The 
Sergeant-at-Arms is charged with enforce-
ment of clause 3(g) rule II, which prohibits 
the use of electronic devices for still photog-
raphy or for audio or visual recording or 
broadcasting in contravention of clause 5 of 
rule XVII and the policies just articulated. 
The Chair would advise Members of the fol-
lowing policies of the Sergeant-at-Arms sur-
rounding the rules change. The Sergeant-at- 
Arms will enforce the prohibition with re-
spect to violations observed first-hand on the 
House floor as well as violations that become 
apparent at a later time, such as through 
publication online or broadcast on tele-
vision. In the case of violations observed on 
the floor, the Sergeant-at-Arms will hand 
the offending Member a card noting the vio-
lation, and will follow up by sending the 
Member a written letter. In the case of other 
violations, Members will receive a written 
letter detailing the offending conduct. The 
fine for a first offense is $500. The fine for 
each subsequent offense is $2500. The Ser-
geant-at-Arms will endeavor to provide 
Members a written warning prior to assess-
ing a fine for a first offense. Because of the 
inherent difficulty of enforcing this prohibi-
tion during ceremonial events, the Sergeant- 
at-Arms may choose not to cite minor viola-
tions occurring during such an event. Pursu-
ant to clause 3(g)(3) of rule II, in addition to 
notifying the Member, Delegate, or Resident 
Commissioner concerned, the Sergeant-at- 
Arms will also notify the Speaker, the Chief 
Administrative Officer, and the Committee 
on Ethics of any fine imposed. Upon receiv-
ing notification of a fine, a Member, Dele-
gate, or Resident Commissioner may appeal 
the fine to the Committee on Ethics within 
30 calendar days or 5 legislative days, which-
ever is later. The Sergeant-at-Arms and the 
Committee on Ethics are each authorized to 
establish policies and procedures for the im-
plementation of these rules. The Chief Ad-
ministrative Officer is authorized to estab-
lish policies and procedures for deducting 
any such fine from a Member’s net salary. It 
is the desire of the Chair that any such poli-
cies and procedures be submitted for printing 
in the Congressional Record. Nothing in the 
House rules or this policy deprives the House 
of its ability to address breaches of decorum 
or other violations of House rules that may 
give rise to questions of the privileges of the 
House under rule IX. The Chair appreciates 
the attention of all Members to these efforts. 
10. Use of Chamber 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 6, 2009, with respect to use of the Cham-
ber will continue in the 117th Congress. The 
Chair will announce to the House the policy 
of the Speaker concerning appropriate com-
portment in the chamber when the House is 
not in session. Under clause 3 of rule I, the 
Speaker is responsible to control the Hall of 
the House. Under clause 1 of rule IV, the Hall 
of the House is to be used only for the legis-
lative business of the House, for caucus and 
conference meetings of its Members, and for 
such ceremonies as the House might agree to 
conduct there. When the House stands ad-
journed, its chamber remains on static dis-
play. It may accommodate visitors in the 
gallery or on the floor, subject to the needs 
of those who operate, maintain, and secure 
the chamber to go about their ordinary busi-
ness. Because outside ‘‘coverage’’ of the 
chamber is limited to floor proceedings and 
is allowed only by accredited journalists, 
when the chamber is on static display no 
audio or video recording or transmitting de-
vices are allowed. The long custom of dis-
allowing even still photography in the cham-
ber is based at least in part on the notion 
that an image having this setting as its 
backdrop might be taken to carry the impri-
matur of the House. The imprimatur of the 
House adheres to the Journal of its pro-
ceedings, which is kept pursuant to the Con-
stitution. The imprimatur of the House ad-
heres to the Congressional Record, which is 
kept as a substantially verbatim transcript 
pursuant to clause 8 of rule XVII. The impri-
matur of the House adheres to the audio and 
visual transmissions and recordings that are 
made and kept by the television system ad-
ministered by the Speaker pursuant to rule 
V. But the imprimatur of the House may not 
be appropriated to other, ad hoc accounts or 
compositions of events in its chamber. 
11. Conduct during a Covered Period 
The Chair’s announced policies of Decem-
ber 15, 2020, November 18, 2020, and July 29, 
2020, will apply during the pendency of a cov-
ered period pursuant to section 3(s) of House 
Resolution 8. Under clause 2 of rule I, the 
Chair is required to preserve order and deco-
rum in the Chamber. This includes the re-
sponsibility to ensure the protection of 
Member and staff safety and health during 
proceedings. This responsibility is of para-
mount importance, particularly in the midst 
of a pandemic. As such, the Chair wishes to 
stress the importance of safe practices. 
Members and staff will be required to wear 
masks at all times in the Hall of the House 
without exception, including while Members 
are under recognition. Members will not be 
recognized unless they are wearing a mask, 
and recognition will be withdrawn if they re-
move their mask while speaking. The Chair 
expects all Members and staff to adhere to 
this requirement as a sign of respect for the

health, safety, and well-being of others 
present in the Chamber and surrounding 
areas. Members and staff will not be per-
mitted to enter the Hall of the House with-
out wearing a mask. Masks will be available 
at the entry points for any Member who for-
gets to bring one. The Chair views the failure 
to wear a mask as a serious breach of deco-
rum. The Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to en-
force this policy. Based upon the health and 
safety guidance from the attending physi-
cian and the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chair 
would further advise that all Members 
should leave the Chamber promptly after 
casting their votes. Furthermore, Members 
should avoid congregating in the rooms lead-
ing to the Chamber, including the Speaker’s 
lobby. The Chair will continue the practice 
of providing small groups of Members with a 
minimum of 5 minutes within which to cast 
their votes. Members are encouraged to vote 
with their previously assigned group. After 
voting, Members must clear the Chamber to 
allow the next group a safe and sufficient op-
portunity to vote. It is essential for the 
health and safety of Members, staff, and the 
U.S. Capitol Police to consistently practice 
social distancing and to ensure that a safe 
capacity be maintained in the Chamber at 
all times. To that end, the Chair appreciates 
the cooperation of Members and staff in pre-
serving order and decorum in the Chamber 
and in displaying respect and safety for one 
another by wearing a mask and practicing 
social distancing. All announced policies, in-
cluding those addressing decorum in debate 
and the conduct of votes by electronic de-
vice, shall be carried out in harmony with 
this policy during the pendency of a covered 
period.

REGULATIONS 
FOR USE OF DEPOSITION AU-
THORITY 
COMMITTEE ON RULES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 4, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to section 3(b) 
of House Resolution 8, 117th Congress, I here-
by submit the following regulations regard-
ing the conduct of depositions by committee 
and select committee counsel for printing in 
the Congressional Record. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules. 
REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF DEPOSITION 
AUTHORITY 
1. Notices for the taking of depositions 
shall specify the date, time, and place of ex-
amination. Depositions shall be taken under 
oath administered by a member or a person 
otherwise authorized to administer oaths. 
Depositions may continue from day to day. 
2. Consultation with the ranking minority 
member shall include three days’ notice be-
fore any deposition is taken. All members of 
the committee shall also receive three days 
written notice that a deposition will be 
taken, except in exigent circumstances. For 
purposes of these procedures, a day shall not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holi-
days except when the House is in session on 
such a day. 
3. Witnesses may be accompanied at a dep-
osition by personal, nongovernmental coun-
sel to advise them of their rights. Only mem-
bers, committee staff designated by the 
chair or ranking minority member, an offi-
cial reporter, the witness, and the witness’s 
counsel are permitted to attend. Observers 
or counsel for other persons, including coun-
sel for government agencies, may not attend. 
4. The chair of the committee noticing the 
deposition may designate that deposition as 
part of a joint investigation between com-
mittees, and in that case, provide notice to 
the members of the committees. If such a 
designation is made, the chair and ranking 
minority member of the additional com-
mittee(s) may designate committee staff to 
attend pursuant to regulation 3. Members 
and designated staff of the committees may 
attend and ask questions as set forth below. 
5. A deposition shall be conducted by any 
member or committee counsel designated by 
the chair or ranking minority member of the 
Committee that noticed the deposition. 
When depositions are conducted by com-
mittee counsel, there shall be no more than 
two committee counsel permitted to ques-
tion a witness per round. One of the com-
mittee counsel shall be designated by the 
chair and the other by the ranking minority 
member per round. 
6. Deposition questions shall be pro-
pounded in rounds. The length of each round 
shall not exceed 60 minutes per side, and 
shall provide equal time to the majority and 
the minority. In each round, the member(s) 
or committee counsel designated by the 
chair shall ask questions first, and the mem-
ber(s) or committee counsel designated by 
the ranking minority member shall ask 
questions second. 
7. Objections must be stated concisely and 
in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive 
manner. A witness’s counsel may not in-
struct a witness to refuse to answer a ques-
tion, except to preserve a privilege. In the 
event of professional, ethical, or other mis-
conduct by the witness’s counsel during the 
deposition, the Committee may take any ap-
propriate disciplinary action. The witness 
may refuse to answer a question only to pre-
serve a privilege. When the witness has re-
fused to answer a question to preserve a 
privilege, members or staff may (i) proceed 
with the deposition, or (ii) either at that 
time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling 
from the Chair either by telephone or other-
wise. If the Chair overrules any such objec-
tion and thereby orders a witness to answer 
any question to which an objection was 
lodged, the witness shall be ordered to an-
swer. If a member of the committee chooses 
to appeal the ruling of the chair, such appeal 
must be made within three days, in writing, 
and shall be preserved for committee consid-
eration. The Committee’s ruling on appeal 
shall be filed with the clerk of the Com-
mittee and shall be provided to the members 
and witness no less than three days before 
the reconvened deposition. A deponent who 
refuses to answer a question after being di-
rected to answer by the chair may be subject 
to sanction, except that no sanctions may be 
imposed if the ruling of the chair is reversed 
by the committee on appeal. 
8. The Committee chair shall ensure that 
the testimony is either transcribed or elec-
tronically recorded or both. If a witness’s 
testimony is transcribed, the witness or the 
witness’s counsel shall be afforded an oppor-
tunity to review a copy. No later than five 
days after the witness has been notified of 
the opportunity to review the transcript, the 
witness may submit suggested changes to 
the chair. Committee staff may make any 
typographical and technical changes. Sub-
stantive changes, modifications, clarifica-
tions, or amendments to the deposition tran-
script submitted by the witness must be ac-
companied by a letter signed by the witness 
requesting the changes and a statement of 
the witness’s reasons for each proposed 
change. Any substantive changes, modifica-
tions, clarifications, or amendments shall be 
included as an appendix to the transcript 
conditioned upon the witness signing the 
transcript. 
9. The individual administering the oath, if 
other than a member, shall certify on the 
transcript that the witness was duly sworn. 
The transcriber shall certify that the tran-
script is a true record of the testimony, and 
the transcript shall be filed, together with 
any electronic recording, with the clerk of 
the committee in Washington, DC. Deposi-
tions shall be considered to have been taken 
in Washington, DC, as well as the location 
actually taken once filed there with the 
clerk of the committee for the committee’s 
use. The chair and the ranking minority 
member shall be provided with a copy of the 
transcripts of the deposition at the same 
time. 
10. The chair and ranking minority mem-
ber shall consult regarding the release of 
deposition testimony, transcripts, or record-
ings, and portions thereof. If either objects 
in writing to a proposed release of a deposi-
tion testimony, transcript, or recording, or a 
portion thereof, the matter shall be prompt-
ly referred to the committee for resolution. 
11. A witness shall not be required to tes-
tify unless the witness has been provided 
with a copy of section 3(b) of H. Res. 8, 117th 
Congress, and these regulations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H42 
January 4, 2021 
6. Members may not participate in more 
than one committee proceeding simulta-
neously. To facilitate secure remote partici-
pation, members may maintain a connection 
to a software platform while not in attend-
ance (but may not transmit video or audio 
on the software platform at such times). 
B. TECHNOLOGY 
1. When a proceeding is conducted at a re-
mote ‘‘place’’ pursuant to section 4(a)(6) of 
House Resolution 965 of the 116th Congress, 
streaming the proceeding on the commit-
tee’s website constitutes sufficient public, 
Member, and press access for the purposes of 
section 4(e) of such resolution. Proceedings 
may be streamed on a reasonably short delay 
if necessary for technical reasons. 
2. Any text based or private messaging 
function in the software platform used for 
virtual proceedings must be disabled unless 
it is used to provide technical or logistical 
support to members, witnesses, or staff, 
which may be excluded from the public video 
stream and will not be considered a com-
mittee record. 
3. When providing notice of a remote pro-
ceeding, chairs must also provide notice of 
the software platform to be used for partici-
pation. Notice of such software platform con-
stitutes proper notice of a ‘‘place’’ for pur-
poses of section 4(a)(6) of House Resolution 
965 of the 116th Congress. 
4. Members participating remotely must be 
provided access to technical support via tele-
phone throughout any proceeding. 
5. Only members, witnesses, temporarily 
designated participating staff, and necessary 
support staff may have participatory access 
on the software platform, meaning access 
which enables an individual to speak and be 
seen, as opposed to simply viewing the pro-
ceeding. 
6. The committee majority staff, in con-
sultation with the committee minority staff, 
must prepare a list of names or titles of indi-
viduals with participatory access on the soft-
ware platform and share the list with mem-
bers at least 24 hours prior to any pro-
ceeding, to the greatest extent practicable. 
7. Official reporters should be given direct 
access to the platform itself rather than the 
livestream. 
8. Members of the press and the public may 
view remote proceedings via the committee 
website, as outlined in regulation B.1. 
9. Committees must conduct remote pro-
ceedings using software platforms certified 
by the Chief Administrative Officer. The 
Chief Administrative Officer should inform 
committees, including the ranking minority 
members, each time a software platform is 
certified. 
10. To the greatest extent practicable, the 
software platform used for remote pro-
ceedings must enable participants to view 
proceedings in a ‘‘grid view’’ format. 
11. Committee chairs should inform the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on House Administration of any 
impactful technical issues arising from con-
ducting proceedings remotely. 
C. DELIBERATIONS 
1. Committee chairs must allow members 
participating remotely reasonable latitude 
when they are seeking recognition for mo-
tions, points of order, or any other proce-
dures where timeliness is a factor in the 
event that there are problems with tech-
nology such as lag or having the microphone 
muted. 
2. Members seeking recognition while par-
ticipating remotely must do so verbally and 
identify themselves to the chair. It is the re-
sponsibility of the member seeking recogni-
tion to unmute their microphone prior to 
speaking. 
3. No one may unmute a member’s micro-
phone absent an explicit request from the 
member, which may be via another channel. 
4. The chair or an individual designated by 
the chair may mute participants’ micro-
phones when they are not under recognition 
for the purposes of eliminating inadvertent 
background noise. This policy must be car-
ried out uniformly and should be announced 
at the outset of the proceeding. Members 
should have a clear understanding of the 
need to unmute their microphone each time 
they wish to speak. 
D. DECORUM 
1. Member microphones may not be muted 
for the purposes of enforcing decorum. 
2. Members participating remotely must 
conform to the same standards for proper at-
tire as are required to participate in a com-
mittee proceeding in person. 
3. Members and witnesses participating re-
motely should appear before a nonpolitical, 
professionally appropriate background that 
is minimally distracting to other members 
and witnesses, to the greatest extent pos-
sible. 
4. Members are expected to follow proper 
decorum with respect to the display of exhib-
its when participating remotely and should 
refrain from displaying an exhibit when not 
under recognition. 
E. COMMITTEE PROCESS 
l. Committee chairs shall respect members’ 
disparate time zones when scheduling com-
mittee proceedings. 
2. Committees shall provide an electronic 
repository, which may be an email inbox, for 
the submission of motions, amendments, and 
other documents pursuant to section 4(c)(3) 
of House Resolution 965 of the 116th Congress 
and shall notify members regarding how to 
properly submit documents electronically 
before and during a committee proceeding. 
3. Pursuant to section 4(c)(5) of House Res-
olution 965 of the 116th Congress, in deter-
mining the order in which amendments to a 
measure or matter pending before a com-
mittee will be considered in a proceeding 
with remote participants, the chair may give 
priority to amendments, otherwise in order, 
that have been filed with the committee 
through the electronic repository at least 4 
hours prior to the business meeting on said 
measure or matter. 
4. Within 24 hours of declaring a recess pur-
suant to section 4(c)(2) of House Resolution 
965 of the 116th Congress the chair shall no-
tify members of the circumstances which re-
quired the recess to be declared. 
5. Committees shall facilitate the mainte-
nance of electronically-submitted documents 
as part of any committee record maintained 
pursuant to clause 2(e)(1) of rule XI. 
F. COMMITTEE REPORTS 
1. Committee reports shall be filed in a sin-
gle comprehensive submission including: (1) 
the report as a single electronic document; 
(2) the electronic files comprising such docu-
ment; and (3) an electronic file containing 
the reported measure. Such committee re-
ports shall not be officially processed unless 
all requirements are met, and properly filed 
reports shall be processed in the form sub-
mitted. 
2. Committee reports filed electronically 
remain subject to all House rules regarding 
such reports to the extent consistent with 
House Resolution 965 of the 116th Congress. 
3. Except for reports submitted after the 
receipt of separate views pursuant to clause 
2(c) of rule XIII, committee reports filed 
electronically will be officially processed 
only when the House is in session. Commit-
tees must provide reasonable notice to the 
Clerk when the House is out of session prior 
to filing a report electronically upon receiv-
ing all separate views pursuant to clause 2(c) 
of rule XIII. 
4. Committees shall consult with the Clerk 
regarding the appropriate manner in which 
to submit reports electronically pursuant to 
House Resolution 965 of the 116th Congress. 
5. Any committee report of activities sub-
mitted pursuant to clause 1(d)(I) of rule XI 
should include a list of proceedings con-
ducted with remote participation. 
G. WITNESSES 
1. Witnesses participating remotely in a 
committee 
proceeding 
shall 
be 
visible 
onscreen within the software platform unless 
they 
are 
experiencing 
technical 
or 
connectivity issues. 
2. Pursuant to section 4(c)(6) of House Res-
olution 965 of the 116th Congress, witness 
counsel should be allowed access on the re-
mote proceeding software platform if they 
are not in the physical presence of the wit-
ness. It is recommended that counsel facili-
tate a separate secure line of communication 
with the witness. A witness may not be 
unmuted by any other individual and should 
be allowed to use such secure line of commu-
nication while testifying to confer with 
counsel. 
3. A witness may not allow an individual 
not invited to testify to speak on the plat-
form when the witness is testifying re-
motely. A committee chair may provide ex-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

REMOTE VOTING BY PROXY REGULATIONS 
PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 8 
A. PROXY DESIGNATION LETTER 
1. A Member seeking to vote remotely by 
proxy must submit to the Clerk a dated and 
signed letter authorizing another Member to 
serve as their proxy. The letter must be sub-
mitted before the beginning of the first vote 
in which the Member wishes to vote by 
proxy, and must include: 
i. An affirmative statement that because of 
the public health emergency the Member is 
unable to physically attend proceedings in 
the House Chamber and is granting author-
ity to have their vote cast by proxy. 
ii. The name and state of the Member who 
is being designated as a proxy. 
iii. The original signature of the Member 
granting the proxy. Auto-pen or stamped sig-
natures will not satisfy this signature re-
quirement. 
2. A letter missing any of the items in 
paragraph 1 shall not be verified by the Clerk 
pursuant to regulation B.3, which will result 
in the proxy being unable to vote on the 
Member’s behalf. 
B. SUBMISSION OF PROXY DESIGNATION LETTER 
TO CLERK 
1. Before submitting a letter designating a 
proxy, Members must confirm with their des-
ignated proxy that he or she agrees to and is 
able to vote for them. 
2. To ensure the Clerk receives the letter 
in a timely manner, a Member seeking to 
vote by proxy should scan and email the let-
ter to the Clerk from a House-maintained 
email account. Such electronic copy shall be 
actionable by the Clerk, including if, despite 
best efforts, the physical original is lost or 
damaged. 
3. Upon electronic receipt of any letter de-
scribed in these regulations, the Clerk must 
verify the letter and send a confirmation of 
receipt via email. A Member seeking to vote 
by proxy must then send the dated and 
signed hard copy of the letter to the Clerk so 
that it may be kept as a record. The Clerk, 
in concurrence with the Chair of the Com-
mittee on House Administration, may im-
pose additional security requirements with 
respect to the electronic submission of proxy 
letters. 
4. The Clerk must make any letter received 
pursuant to these regulations available on a 
publicly accessible website as quickly as 
practicable upon verification of the letter. 
The Clerk is not required to process, dis-
tribute, or post online any letter received 
that is not required by House Resolution 8 or 
these regulations. 
5. The letter will be used by the Clerk to 
certify that a Member serving as a proxy has 
the authority to cast votes on behalf of the 
Member voting remotely by proxy. 
C. DUTY OF THE PROXY 
1. A Member serving as a proxy must agree 
to and be able to appear in the Capitol for 
roll call votes at any time for the duration of 
the covered period. If they are unwilling or 
unable to perform this duty at any point, 
they must inform the Member for whom they 
are voting by proxy as quickly as possible. 
2. Before a Member’s presence may be re-
corded by proxy during a quorum call, the 
Member serving as a proxy must have exact 
instruction pursuant to regulation C.6 from 
the Member voting by proxy on whether they 
intend to be recorded as present, and must 
follow such instruction in responding to the 
quorum call. 
3. Before a vote may be cast by proxy, the 
Member serving as a proxy must have exact 
instruction pursuant to regulation C.6 from 
the Member voting by proxy on whether they 
intend to vote yea, nay, or present on the 
specific text or matter at hand, and must fol-
low such instruction exactly in casting the 
proxy vote. 
4. If the text of a measure changes after 
such instruction is received, the Member 
serving as a proxy may not cast a vote for 
the Member voting by proxy until new in-
struction is received. 
5. If an identical motion is made to a mo-
tion on which a Member voting by proxy has 
previously given instruction, the Member 
serving as a proxy must still receive voting 
instructions pursuant to regulation C.6 on 
the new motion in order to cast the proxy 
vote. 
6. The Member voting by proxy must pro-
vide written voting instruction (which may 
be in electronic form) to the Member serving 
as proxy. Members shall use official devices 
and accounts to transmit such instruction to 
the maximum extent practicable. If they are 
unable to transmit written instruction in a 
timely manner, a member of their staff may 
transmit the instruction at the direction of 
the Member, and that Member must confirm 
the instruction by telephone to the Member 
serving as proxy before the vote may be cast 
on their behalf. 
D. ALTERATION OR REVOCATION OF PROXY 
1. At any time during the public health 
emergency, a Member is permitted to change 
their designated proxy. 
i. In addition to including all the informa-
tion required by regulation A, a letter 
changing a Member’s proxy must clearly 
state that the signing Member seeks to 
change their proxy from the Member cur-
rently holding their proxy to a different 
Member who will hold their proxy starting 
on the date specified in the letter. 
ii. Any such letter must be submitted fol-
lowing the directions provided for the Proxy 
Designation Letter in regulation B. 
2. A Member may revoke their proxy at 
any time for any reason. Revocation of proxy 
does not prohibit a Member from designating 
a proxy at a later time. 
i. A Member seeking to revoke their proxy 
must send to the Clerk a signed letter revok-
ing their proxy which includes the date upon 
which their proxy is revoked. This letter 
must be submitted following the directions 
provided for the Proxy Designation Letter in 
regulation B. 
ii. Pursuant to section 2(a)(2)(B) of House 
Resolution 965 of the 116th Congress, a Mem-
ber will be considered to have revoked their 
proxy if they vote or record their own pres-
ence in the House Chamber. A revocation let-
ter is not necessary in this instance. 
E. TIMING OF VOTES 
1. The Majority Leader must provide Mem-
bers with 24-hours’ notice before any vote on 
the final disposition of bills or joint resolu-
tions conducted during the period designated 
by the Speaker pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 8.

INTRODUCTION OF THE 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the Washington, D.C. Admission 
Act with 202 cosponsors, a record number of 
original cosponsors of the District of Columbia 
statehood bill. This is the most important bill I 
introduce each Congress, and it made historic 
strides in the last Congress. District residents 
have always been citizens of the United 
States and pay more federal taxes per capita 
than the residents of any state, but are the 
only federal income taxpaying Americans who 
do not have full and equal citizenship rights. 
The denial of local control on local matters 
and of equal representation in Congress can 
be remedied only by statehood. My introduc-
tion of this bill this Congress comes after this 
Chamber’s historic and decisive passage of 
the Washington, D.C. Admission Act in the 
116th Congress. I look forward to building on 
our historic momentum. 
The Washington, D.C. Admission Act cre-
ates a state from the eight hometown wards of 
the District. This 51st state, of course, would 
have no jurisdiction over the federal district 
that now consists of the Washington that 
Members of Congress and visitors associate 
with the capital of our country. The U.S. Cap-
itol, the White House, the U.S. Supreme 
Court, the principal federal monuments, fed-
eral buildings and grounds and the National 
Mall would remain in the federal district, which 
would be called the Capital. Our bill provides 
that the State of Washington, Douglass Com-
monwealth would be equal to the other 50 
states in all respects, as is always required, 
and that the residents of the State of Wash-
ington, D.C. would have all the rights of citi-
zenship, including two senators and, initially, 
one House member. 
A substantially similar version of the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act was the first bill I 
introduced after I was first sworn in as a Mem-
ber of Congress in the 102nd Congress in 
1991. Our first try for statehood received sig-
nificant support in the House. In 1993, the 
House voted on the D.C. statehood bill, which 
was the first time either Chamber had done 
so, with nearly 60 percent of Democrats and 
one Republican voting for the bill. The Senate 
held a hearing on various approaches to rep-
resentation for D.C., but the committee of ju-
risdiction did not proceed further. In the 113th 
Congress, our statehood bill got unprece-
dented momentum with the Senate’s first-ever 
hearing on D.C. statehood. That was the first 
congressional hearing on D.C. statehood in 
more than 20 years, since the House held a 
hearing on statehood in 1993. In the 113th 
Congress, we obtained a record number of co-
sponsors in the House and Senate, including 
then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, as 
well as the other top three Democratic leaders 
in the Senate. In addition, then-President 
Barack Obama endorsed D.C. statehood in a 
public forum before the statehood hearing was 
held. In the 115th Congress, not only was 
there a record number of original cosponsors 
of the bill, with 116 in the House and 18 in the 
Senate, but also a record number of cospon-
sors in the House (181) and Senate (30). 
The 116th Congress, however, represented 
a turning point in the march to D.C. statehood. 
For the first time in American history, a Cham-
ber of Congress voted to make Washington, 
Douglass Commonwealth the 51st state. We 
introduced the bill with a record number of 
original cosponsors in the House (155) and 
Senate (28), and had, by far, a record number 
of cosponsors in the House (227), which was 
more than enough to pass the bill with co-
sponsors alone, and in the Senate (42). More 
than 100 national organizations endorsed the 
bill. 
The United States is the only democratic 
country that denies the residents of the na-
tion’s capital both voting rights in the national 
legislature and local autonomy. We have both 
the moral obligation and legal authority to end 
this injustice. 
Statehood is the only solution for full and 
equal citizenship rights for residents of the 
District. To be content with less than state-
hood is to concede the equality of citizenship 
that is the birthright of our residents as citi-
zens of the United States. That is a conces-
sion no American citizen has ever made, and 
one that D.C. residents will not tolerate in their 
220th year of fighting for equal treatment in 
their country. This bill reaffirms our determina-
tion to obtain each and every right enjoyed by 
citizens of the United States, by becoming the 
51st state in the Union. 
Since the nation’s founding, District resi-
dents have always carried all of the obliga-
tions of citizenship, including serving in all of 
the nation’s wars and payment of federal 
taxes, all without equal voting representation 
on the floor in either House of Congress or 
freedom from congressional interference in 
purely local matters. 
D.C. statehood has both the facts and the 
Constitution on its side. The Constitution does 
not establish any prerequisites for new states, 
but Congress has generally considered three 
factors in admission decisions: resources and 
population, support for statehood and commit-
ment to democracy. 
D.C. pays more federal taxes per capita 
than any state and pays more federal taxes 
than 22 states. D.C.’s population of 712,000 is 
larger than those of two states, and the new 
state would be one of seven states with a 
population under one million. D.C.’s budget is 
larger than those of 12 states, and D.C.’s 
bond rating is higher than those of 35 states. 
D.C. has a higher per capita personal income 
and gross domestic product than any state. 
Eighty-six percent of D.C. residents voted for 
statehood in 2016. In fact, D.C. residents have 
been fighting for voting rights in Congress and 
local autonomy for 219 years. 
The Constitution’s Admissions Clause gives 
Congress the authority to admit new states, 
and all 37 new states have been admitted by 
an act of Congress. The Constitution’s District 
Clause sets a maximum size of the federal 
district (100 square miles). It does not set a 
minimum 
size. 
Congress 
previously 
has 
changed the size of the federal district, includ-
ing reducing it by 30 percent in 1846. 
I seek statehood for the Americans I am 
honored to represent. At the same time, D.C. 
statehood is deeply personal for me. My great- 
grandfather Richard Holmes, who escaped as 
a slave from a Virginia plantation, made it as 
far as D.C., a walk to freedom but not to equal 
citizenship. For three generations my family 
has been denied the rights other Americans 
take for granted. There are many other D.C. 
residents like me. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

HONORING JOSEPH A. PROVONCHA, 
THE 
MOST 
SENIOR 
COUNTY 
CLERK 
IN 
NEW 
YORK 
STATE, 
FOR HIS LONG-TIME SERVICE TO 
NEW YORKERS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Joseph A. Provoncha for his 
service and dedication to his community as 
the most senior County Clerk in New York 
State. 
Joseph first took office on January 1, 1992 
as an Essex County Clerk and was elected to 
his eighth term in 2019. Joseph is now the 
most senior County Clerk in New York State. 
Throughout his career, he has held a variety 
of different positions in addition to his roles as 
County Clerk and Agent for the DMV Commis-
sioner; these include Records Management 
Officer, Commissioner of Jurors, and Commis-
sioner of Youth Services. He has been recog-
nized many times throughout his prominent 
career being presented with the Liberty Bell 
Award by the Essex County BAR Association 
in 1997 and in 2014, the Lifetime Achievement 
Award by the New York State Association of 
County Clerks in 2001, and the William H. 
Kelley Annual Archives Award by the New 
York State Archives and the Archives Partner-
ship Trust in 2018. He was named Clerk of 
Year in 1996. Additionally, he served as the 
Association President of the New York State 
Association of County Clerks in 2000 and has 
been serving as the Recording Secretary 
since 2006. 
Joseph’s exemplary service is a testament 
to the character of our North Country neigh-
bors. In his role, he has ensured anyone who 
walks into the Essex County Clerk’s Office 
leaves with their questions answered and 
problems solved. His longtime dedication to 
his role as County Clerk has served the com-
munity very well as he has spent his career 
assisting others navigate the complexities of 
bureaucracy.

100 original cosponsors. 
This legislation was first introduced in 1989 
by the late and beloved Congressman John 
Conyers of Michigan, the former chairman of 
the Committee on the Judiciary, and is in-
tended to examine the institution of slavery in 
the colonies and the United States from 1619 
to the present, and, further, to recommend ap-
propriate remedies. 
Since the initial introduction of this legisla-
tion, 
proponents 
have 
made 
substantial 
progress 
in 
elevating 
the 
discussion 
of 
reparatory justice at the national level and 
joining the mainstream international debate on 
the issues. 
Though some have tried to deflect the im-
portance of these conversations by focusing 
on individual monetary compensation, the real 
issue is whether and how this nation can 
come to grips with the legacy of slavery that 
still infects current society. 
Through legislation, resolutions, news, and 
litigation, we are moving closer to making 
more 
strides 
in 
the 
movement 
toward 
reparatory relief. 
Today, there are more people at the table— 
more activists, more scholars, more CEOs, 
more state and local officials, and more Mem-
bers of Congress. 
However, despite this progress and the 
election of the first American President of Afri-
can descent, the legacy of slavery lingers 
heavily in this nation. 
While we have focused on the social effects 
of slavery and segregation, its continuing eco-
nomic inequalities and disparities remain 
largely ignored by mainstream analysis. 
These economic issues are the root cause 
of many critical issues in the African American 
community 
today, 
such 
as 
education, 
healthcare and criminal justice policy, includ-
ing policing practices. 
The call for reparatory justice represents a 
commitment to entering a constructive dia-
logue on the role of slavery and racism in 
shaping present-day conditions in our commu-
nity and American society. 
H.R. 40 is important and needed legislation 
because it goes beyond exploring the eco-
nomic implications of slavery and segregation. 
It is a holistic bill in the sense that estab-
lishes a commission to examine the moral and 
social implications of slavery. 
Madam Speaker, the United States is the 
world’s only superpower and boasts the larg-
est economy in the history of the world and for 
many years was the world’s indispensable na-
tion and the example that all aspiring democ-
racies wished to emulate. 
At the same time, this nation has also been 
home to many searing instances of social un-
rest resulting from racial injustices, as we are 
now witnessing on the streets of big cities and 
small towns in urban and rural communities. 
We are seeing Americans, by the millions, 
across the country, coming from all races and 
ages, engaging in what the late John Lewis 
called ‘‘good trouble’’ by protesting and de-
manding an end to the systemic racial inequal-
ity in our criminal justice system that too often 
victimizes and disproportionately treats black 
Americans worse, ceteris paribus, when it 
comes to suspicion, apprehension, arrest, de-
tention, trial, sentencing, and incarceration. 
While the brutal deaths of George Floyd in 
Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville 
shocked the conscience of the nation, most 
black Americans will tell you what they experi-
enced is not new, but has been occurring for 
generations, if not centuries. 
What is critically important to understand is 
that the instances of brutal and unfair treat-
ment the nation has witnessed this year can-
not be attributed to the proverbial few ‘‘bad 
apples in the bushel’’ but is instead the fore-
seeable consequence of systemic racism and 
racial inequality in the system. 
Not just the criminal justice system, but the 
health care system, the economic system, and 
the educational system to name the most glar-
ing examples. 
To find our way out of this dark time, we 
need to understand how it came to be. 
That is the purpose of H.R. 40, which estab-
lishes a commission to examine slavery and 
discrimination in the colonies and the United 
States from 1619 to the present and rec-
ommend appropriate remedies. 
Among other requirements, the commission 
shall identify (1) the role of federal and state 
governments in supporting the institution of 
slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the pub-
lic and private sectors against freed slaves 
and their descendants; and (3) lingering nega-
tive effects of slavery on living African-Ameri-
cans and society. 
Truth and reconciliation about the Original 
Sin of American Slavery is necessary to light 
the way to the beloved community we all 
seek. 
The uncomfortable truth is that the United 
States owes its position as the most powerful 
nation in the world to its slave-owning past. 
Initially, slavery in America was not insti-
tuted for black people. 
The colonists in the southern states simply 
wanted persons to cultivate and hue the soil of 
the New World’s wild untamed lands. 
And they wanted to exploit these boundless 
natural resources as cheaply as possible. 
At first, they tried to enslave the indigenous 
persons they found when they arrived from 
Old World but that did not work because the 
native persons they encountered were no-
madic rather than agrarian. 
So next, landowners turned to poor persons 
from Europe arriving to work as indentured 
servants, but this did not work either for sev-
eral reasons. 
First, such persons were not as hardy in 
working under the difficult conditions that ex-
isted. 
Also, because as subjects of the British 
Crown, indentured workers enjoyed legal 
rights and protections. 
Finally, being white themselves, European 
indentured servants could escape and blend 
into the general colonial population. 
That is why the landowners set their sights 
on the western coast of Africa and its people. 
That experiment in trafficking in persons 
failed as well and culminated in a bloody Civil 
War, but not before America profited hand-
somely from what President Lincoln rightly 
characterized in his Second Inaugural as ‘‘the 
bondsmen’s two-hundred and fifty years of un-
requited toil.’’ 
Slavery helped make America an industrial 
nation but at the cost of inflicting physical, 
economic, social, psychological, and political 
damage on Black Americans that despite the 
progress that has been made continues to this 
day with stark racial disparities in health care, 
employment, housing, food, education, and in-
deed nearly every aspect of American life and 
death. 
Madam Speaker, official slavery ended with 
the Civil War and ratification of the Thirteenth 
Amendment. 
But unofficial slavery was continued with the 
new institution of sharecrop farming, a criminal 
justice system that would press convicts into 
work once done by slaves, and labor policies 
that dictated income for work done based 
upon skin color. 
And, of course, all of this was reinforced by 
the systematic disenfranchisement of Black 
Americans, the ‘‘discrete and insular minority’’ 
excluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, to 
quote Chief Justice Hughes’ famous Carolene 
Products Footnote 4. 
For these reasons, the history of the United 
States is intertwined with the history of 
enslaved Africans in the Americas. 
Madam Speaker, there is blood and there 
are tears, but there is also redemption and 
reconciliation. 
But to get there, we must know the com-
plete truth and lay our history bare. 
The Commission created and empowered 
by H.R. 40 is a necessary first step in that ef-
fort. 
I encourage all Members to join me in co-
sponsoring H.R. 40, the ‘‘Commission to Study 
and Develop Reparation proposals for African 
Americans Act.’’

Edwards, and his many contributions as a 
health care provider, as a father and grand-
father, and as a beloved member of his com-
munity. 
Ameer was born in Camden, New Jersey on 
May 4, 1970, where he was the youngest of 
4 children born to Cheryl and Malik Chaka. 
Shortly after graduating from the University 
of Pennsylvania School of Law, Ameer’s moth-
er Cheryl Amana Burris moved to San Fran-
cisco, where she took a job as senior assist-
ant to Willie L. Brown, who was then a Cali-
fornia State Legislator and later became 
Speaker of the California State Assembly dur-
ing her tenure. 
While in San Francisco Ammeter attended 
various 
local 
elementary 
and 
secondary 
schools including Grattan Elementary School 
and Ecole Notre Dame des Yictoires. 
Ameer moved back to the east coast with 
his mother who needed to assist with her fa-
ther who was diagnosed with cancer. He at-
tended schools in New Jersey, Philadelphia 
and North Carolina, where he graduated from 
Charles E. Jordan High School. 
Ameer attended college at Hampton Univer-
sity, North Carolina A&T State University and 
later graduated with honors from North Caro-
lina Central University. He continued his edu-
cation by getting a master’s degree from North 
Carolina State University. 
Ameer worked for over 20 years at Univer-
sity of No11h Carolina Memorial Hospital as a 
Health Care Unit Coordinator. He was a hard 
worker who rarely took time off, and who was 
highly respected by his coworkers. Ameer re-
ceived numerous awards for his work. As re-
cently as May 2020, he was chosen as the top 
employee in his position throughout the entire 
university. 
Ameer was the father of three adult children 
and two grandchildren, all of whom he loved 
and with whom he spent as much time as 
possible. He was devoted to his mother and 
siblings, and there was nothing he would not 
do for them to make their lives more enjoy-
able. 
Ameer departed this life on early Monday 
morning of December 28, 2020, after an ex-
tended struggle with cancer. His mother was 
holding his hand when he quietly passed 
away. 
On behalf of California’s 13th Congressional 
District, I recognize Ameer K. Edwards for his 
contributions to his family and his community, 
and I extend my sincere condolences to his 
loved ones.

WELCOMING CONGRESSWOMAN 
NANCY MACE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, an article today by Caitlyn Byrd ti-
tled, ‘‘Republican Nancy Mace to be sworn in 
as South Carolina’s newest member of Con-
gress’’ in The State newspaper of Columbia 
reports that: 
‘‘[Nancy Mace will be] South Carolina’s 
newest member of Congress and the state’s 
only female representative in Washington.’’ 
(She is one of the 15 Congressional seats 
flipped in 2020 from Democrat to Repub-
lican). 
‘‘Mace, 43, joins a record-breaking number 
of Republican women elected to the U.S. 
House of Representatives. Mace, a Daniel Is-
land Republican, will be one of 18 freshman 
GOP women in the 117th Congress. 
‘‘Mace’s two children, Elli and Miles, were 
expected to watch their mom become a con-
gresswoman . . .’’ 
As a native of Charleston myself, I am 
grateful for the success of Congresswoman 
MACE. I also appreciate my mother, Wray Wil-
son, who campaigned in Charleston for Presi-
dent Eisenhower in 1952 before there were 
any elected Republicans in South Carolina, at 
any level. With the Trump landslide, now there 
are the largest Republican majorities in the 
state with more elected Republicans in 140 
years. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops and we 
will never forget September 11th in the Global 
War on Terrorism.

SUPPORTING EARLY-CAREER 
RESEARCHERS ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am joined by Ranking Member LUCAS 
in introducing the Supporting Early-Career Re-
searchers Act. 
As access to COVID–19 vaccines continues 
to grow, so too does our optimism for emerg-
ing from this long national crisis. I look forward 
to the day when this virus is under control and 
we can begin the process of recovery. While 
the full scope of the damage is not yet known, 
there can be no doubt that this virus has 
touched every segment of our society. As 
Chair of the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, I am deeply concerned about 
the severe and long-lasting impacts of this 
pandemic on our nation’s research enterprise. 
In order to slow the spread of the virus, uni-
versities across the country were forced to 
cancel in person classes and shut down cam-
pus operations as they slowly transitioned to 
remote learning and hybrid approaches. I 
commend universities for their dedication to 
doing their part to slow the spread of the virus 
and for their commitment to ensuring the safe-
ty of their students, faculty, and staff. Univer-
sities also stepped up to donate personal pro-
tective 
equipment, 
reconfigure 
laboratory 
space and equipment for COVID–19 research 
and provide for testing and contact tracing. 
These actions, while likely life-saving, came 
at a cost. The full extent of the financial loss 
incurred by universities is unknowable at this 
point. In order to stave off catastrophe, many 
universities instituted hiring freezes and can-
celled new faculty hires. 
I am deeply worried about the disappear-
ance of STEM job opportunities and the po-
tential long-term consequences for our STEM 
pipeline and consequently our innovation eco-
system. For established researchers, the 
COVID–19 crisis has severely limited their ac-
cess to their laboratory space. But for early 
career researchers, these disruptions came at 
a critical juncture in their research career, 
threatening to derail their career path. 
Even in normal times, postdoctoral research 
positions provide little job security, with most 
postdocs employed on two-year contracts. 
With the academic job market severely con-
tracted, postdocs find themselves in a truly 
precarious position. Many of them may be 
forced to abandon their career path altogether 
in order to support themselves and their fami-
lies. 
I am thrilled that, after months of delibera-
tions, a bipartisan COVID–19 relief package 
has been enacted. While this package in-
cludes funding for universities, it falls far short 
of meeting the need. We must act now to 
avoid losing an entire generation of talented 
scientists and engineers from our research 
pipeline. These are they very people whom we 
will need to overcome the next health crisis, to 
protect our population against the con-
sequences of catastrophic climate change, 
and to ensure we remain a global leader in 
science and technology—leadership that is es-
sential to our economic and national security. 
The Supporting Early-Career Researchers 
Act establishes a $250 million postdoctoral fel-
lowship pilot program at the National Science 
Foundation. This program would provide au-
thorization for a much-needed bridge to help 
early career researchers weather this storm 
and prevent a permanent loss of STEM talent 
our nation can ill afford. I look forward to mov-
ing this bill quickly.

DECEMBER VETERAN OF THE 
MONTH—MITCH REED 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the First District of Oklahoma’s December Vet-
eran of the Month, Mitch Reed. 
He served in an armored personnel carrier 
in the United States Army, Mitch Reed honor-
ably served our nation. Mitch continues to 
serve his fellow veterans through his volunteer 
work with the Military Order of the Purple 
Heart and the Military History Center in Bro-
ken Arrow. 
Mitch Reed served in the Vietnam War. He 
is the recipient of two Purple Hearts among 
other awards. He continues to serve veterans 
in our community and advocate for programs 
to honor them through the Military Order of the 
Purple Heart. His efforts led to the designation 
of Broken Arrow as a Purple Heart City and 
Tulsa County as a Purple Heart County. A 
designation that shows our community’s grati-
tude to our veterans and those currently serv-
ing in our military. 
He answered the call to defend freedom 
across the globe and sacrificed whatever was 
necessary in the name of that noble cause. It 
is my honor to recognize Mitch Reed as the 
1st Congressional District of Oklahoma’s De-
cember Veteran of the Month.

Hall on his well-earned retirement after 33 
years of service to the Congress at the Con-
gressional Budget Office. Ray began his Con-
gressional career in CBO’s Budget Analysis 
Division in 1987 where he worked as a prin-
cipal analyst in the Defense, International Af-
fairs and Veterans’ Affairs, Cost Estimates 
Unit. 
During his time at CBO, Ray was recog-
nized as a knowledgeable and experienced 
analyst. As one of the longest tenured mem-
bers of CBO’s Budget Analysis Division, he 
has accrued extensive knowledge of the pro-
grams and accounts in his portfolio. 
Ray earned the gratitude of his colleagues 
at CBO and of his counterparts on the staff of 
the Committee on Armed Services. He estab-
lished a solid working relationship with the 
Armed Services Committees, and for more 
than three decades was a valued contributor 
to CBO’s work on the proposals for the annual 
National Defense Authorization Act. His tech-
nical feedback on legislative proposals made 
important contribution to the Armed Services 
Committees’ success in achieving the timely 
enactment of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act each year. 
With his departure, Congressional Budget 
Office lost a great asset. Over the past 33 
years, the Congressional Budget Office—and 
by extension, the Congress itself—has been 
fortunate to enjoy the effort Ray brought to his 
work. I know my colleagues join me in extend-
ing our thanks and appreciation to Ray for his 
service to our nation and our very best wishes 
for a happy and productive retirement.
