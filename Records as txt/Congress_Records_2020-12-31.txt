House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord, Father of us all, we give You 
thanks for giving us another day—an-
other year. 
Today, the last day of 2020, a most 
difficult year in so many ways, we ask 
Your blessing on this House and upon 
our Nation this penultimate pro forma 
session of the 116th Congress. 
As we ‘‘gather,’’ virtually like the 
rest of our world in this time, we 
mourn the death of the first Member of 
Congress, Luke Letlow, newly elected 
and not yet sworn in, of COVID. Only 
41, his death brings the brutal nature of 
this coronavirus plague to the doorstep 
of Congress. May all here find, with 
Your grace O Lord, the renewed energy 
and resolve to put our Nation’s assets 
to the suppression of this disease. Lord, 
have mercy. 
Bless as well those who have labored 
in these Halls and offices during this 
extraordinary 
year. 
Without 
their 
steady and faithful service, the work of 
Congress would not have been possible. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

be associated with several aspects of 
suicide including intrinsic and extrin-
sic factors related to areas such as 
wellbeing, resilience, and vulnerabil-
ity, with the Senate amendment there-
to, and concur in the Senate amend-
ment. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

research that is improving our basic under-
standing of factors with potential relevance to 
suicide, including potential relevance to preven-
tion and treatment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9171 
December 31, 2020 
the Speaker’s table the bill (S. 1310) to 
strengthen the participation of elected 
national legislators in the activities of 
the Organization of American States 
and reaffirm United States support for 
Organization 
of 
American 
States 
human rights and anti-corruption ini-
tiatives, and for other purposes, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentlewoman from 
Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1310 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Organiza-
tion of American States Legislative Engage-
ment Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Charter of the Organization of 
American States establishes that ‘‘represent-
ative democracy is an indispensable condi-
tion for the stability, peace and development 
of the region’’. 
(2) Article 2 of the Inter-American Demo-
cratic Charter of the Organization of Amer-
ican States affirms that ‘‘the effective exer-
cise of representative democracy is the basis 
for the rule of law and of the constitutional 
regimes of the member states of the Organi-
zation of American States’’. 
(3) Article 26 of the Inter-American Demo-
cratic Charter states that ‘‘the OAS will con-
tinue to carry out programs and activities 
designed to promote democratic principles 
and practices and strengthen a democratic 
culture in the Hemisphere’’. 
(4) In accordance with the OAS Charter 
and the Inter-American Democratic Charter, 
the OAS General Assembly, OAS Permanent 
Council, and OAS Secretariat have estab-
lished a wide range of cooperative agree-
ments with domestic and international orga-
nizations, including national legislative in-
stitutions. 
(5) In 2004, OAS General Assembly Resolu-
tion 2044 (XXXIV–O/04) appealed for the 
‘‘strengthening of legislatures, as well as 
inter-parliamentary 
cooperation 
on 
key 
items of the inter-American agenda, with a 
view, in particular, to generating initiatives 
to fight corruption, poverty, inequality, and 
social exclusion’’. 
(6) In 2005, OAS General Assembly Resolu-
tion 2095 (XXXV–O/05) called on the OAS Sec-
retariat to ‘‘invite [. . .] the presidents or 
speakers of the national legislative institu-
tions of the Americas, i.e., congresses, par-
liaments, or national assemblies, [. . .] to at-
tend a special meeting of the Permanent 
Council [. . .] for the initiation of a dialogue 
on topics on the hemispheric agenda’’. 
(7) In 2014 and 2015, the OAS Secretariat ex-
panded its engagement with elected national 
legislators from OAS member states by con-
vening two meetings of presidents of na-
tional legislatures, first in Lima, Peru and 
subsequently in Santiago, Chile. 
(8) However, no permanent procedures 
exist to facilitate the participation of elect-
ed national legislators from OAS member 
states in OAS activities. 
(9) The Organization for Security and Co- 
operation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary 
Assembly has proven successful at strength-
ening 
inter-parliamentary 
cooperation 
among its member states. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is that sense of Congress that— 
(1) elected national legislators play an es-
sential role in the exercise of representative 
democracy in the Americas, including by— 
(A) promoting economic freedom and re-
spect for property rights; 
(B) promoting the rule of law and com-
bating corruption; 
(C) defending human rights and funda-
mental freedoms; and 
(D) advancing the principles and practices 
expressed in the Charter of the Organization 
of American States, the American Declara-
tion on the Rights and Duties of Man, and 
the Inter-American Democratic Charter; 
(2) establishing procedures and mecha-
nisms to facilitate the participation of elect-
ed national legislators from OAS member 
states in OAS activities could contribute to 
the promotion of democratic principles and 
practices and strengthen a democratic cul-
ture in the Western Hemisphere; 
(3) increasing and strengthening the par-
ticipation of elected national legislators 
from OAS member states in OAS activities 
could advance the principles and proposals 
expressed in section 4 of the Organization of 
American States Revitalization and Reform 
Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–41; 127 Stat. 549); 
(4) the OAS General Assembly, OAS Per-
manent Council, and OAS Secretariat should 
take steps to facilitate greater participation 
of elected national legislators from OAS 
member states in OAS activities; 
(5) the OAS Permanent Council resolutions 
titled ‘‘Guidelines for the Participation of 
Civil Society in OAS Activities’’ and ‘‘Strat-
egies for Increasing and Strengthening Par-
ticipation by Civil Society Organizations in 
OAS Activities’’ should serve as important 
references for efforts to bolster the partici-
pation of elected national legislators from 
OAS member states in OAS activities; and 
(6) the successful experience of the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope Parliamentary Assembly should serve 
as a model to the OAS in creating a similar 
mechanism. 
SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING PARTICIPATION OF 
ELECTED NATIONAL LEGISLATORS 
AT THE OAS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State, 
acting through the United States Mission to 
the Organization of American States, should 
use the voice and vote of the United States 
to support the creation of procedures for the 
Organization of American States that— 
(1) enhance the participation of democrat-
ically elected national legislators from OAS 
member state countries in OAS activities 
that advance the principles of the Inter- 
American Democratic Charter and the core 
values of the OAS consistent with the prin-
ciples and proposals expressed in section 4 of 
the Organization of American States Revi-
talization and Reform Act of 2013 (Public 
Law 113–41; 127 Stat. 549); 
(2) create an annual forum for democrat-
ically elected national legislatures from OAS 
member states to discuss issues of hemi-
spheric importance, including regional ef-
forts to defend human rights and combat 
transnational criminal activities, corrup-
tion, and impunity; 
(3) permit elected national legislators from 
OAS member states to make presentations, 
contribute information, and provide expert 
advice, as appropriate, to the OAS Secre-
tariat, OAS Permanent Council, and OAS 
General Assembly about OAS activities on 
issues of hemispheric importance; 
(4) lead to the creation of a mechanism to 
regularly facilitate the participation of 
elected national legislators in OAS activi-
ties; and 
(5) reinforce OAS Secretariat programs 
that provide technical assistance for the 
modernization and institutional strength-
ening of national legislatures from OAS 
member states. 
(b) EXPENSES.—The Secretary of State, 
acting through the United States Mission to 
the Organization of American States, as ap-
propriate, shall seek to ensure that expenses 
related to the procedures set forth in this 
Act do not increase member quotas, assessed 
fees, or voluntary contributions and that the 
Secretariat of the OAS shall seek to ensure 
shared financial responsibilities among the 
member states in facilitating the financial 
support necessary to carry out this initia-
tive. 
SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR OAS HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVES. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the efforts of the OAS Secretary Gen-
eral and Secretariat to combat corruption 
and impunity in the Americas represent im-
portant contributions to strengthening the 
rule of law and democratic governance in the 
Americas; and 
(2) the United States should support efforts 
to ensure the effectiveness and independence 
of OAS initiatives to combat corruption and 
impunity in the Americas. 
(b) ANTI-CORRUPTION
AND
HUMAN
RIGHTS 
PROMOTION STRATEGY.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of the 
Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
Senate and the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs of the House of Representatives a strat-
egy for supporting OAS anti-corruption and 
human rights promotion efforts. The strat-
egy should include— 
(1) an assessment of United States pro-
grams, activities, and initiatives with the 
OAS to support anti-corruption and human 
rights promotion in the Americas; 
(2) a summary of the steps taken by the 
United States Mission to the OAS to 
strengthen anti-corruption and anti-impu-
nity efforts in the Americas; 
(3) an assessment of necessary reforms and 
initiatives to prioritize and reinforce the 
OAS Secretary General and Secretariat’s ef-
forts to advance human rights and combat 
corruption and impunity in the Americas; 
(4) a detailed plan to facilitate increased 
OAS collaboration, as appropriate, with rel-
evant stakeholders, including elected na-
tional legislators and civil society, in sup-
port of an approach to promote human rights 
and combat transnational criminal activi-
ties, corruption, and impunity in the Amer-
icas; and 
(5) a detailed plan for implementing the 
strategy set forth in this section of the Act. 
SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State shall submit to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Sen-
ate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives a report on 
OAS processes, initiatives, and reforms un-
dertaken to implement section 4, actions 
taken to implement the strategy required 
under section 5(b), and steps taken to imple-
ment the Organization of American States 
Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Pub-
lic Law 113–41). The report should include—

OAS to adopt and effectively implement re-
forms and initiatives to advance human 
rights and combat corruption and impunity 
in the Americas; and 
(2) a detailed assessment of OAS efforts to

Congress finds that, since the Global Anti- 
Semitism Review Act of 2004 (Public Law 108– 
332) was enacted, in many foreign countries acts 
of anti-Semitism have been frequent and wide in 
scope, the perpetrators and variety of threats to 
Jewish communities and their institutions have 
proliferated, and in some countries anti-Semitic 
attacks have increased in frequency, scope, vio-
lence, and deadliness.

ITISM.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord God, as the new year 
beckons, our souls rise to meet You, 
for You are the source of our strength 
and the hope of our lives. We put our 
lives in Your hands, trusting You with 
all our tomorrows. 
Lord, You bless us with Your peace, 
even in the midst of life’s storms. 
Uphold our Senators. Give them 
hours that sustain rather than stress. 
Permit the rhythm of Your truth to 
free them from the bondage that debili-
tates. May they find strength in You as 
they give You their restlessness and 
doubts. 
We pray in Your wonderful Name. 
Amen.

f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, the Senate was finally able 
to proceed to this year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act. A few of our 
Democratic colleagues have pulled out 
all the stops to hold back this crucial 
bill, but last night, a big bipartisan 
majority of 80 Senators voted to pro-
ceed. 
There should be nothing controver-
sial about giving our brave men and 
women in uniform the tools and train-
ing they need to stay safe. There 
should be nothing controversial about 
continuing the work of rebuilding and 
modernizing our capabilities. It should 
be 
a 
nonpartisan 
proposition 
that 
America should keep pace with Russia 
and China rather than slip behind. 
We have enacted an annual NDAA for 
59 straight years and counting. In the 
next few days, the easy way or the hard 
way, we are going to do our job once 
again. This body will fulfill our respon-
sibility to the men and women who 
protect our country. The Senate will be 
here until we finish this bipartisan leg-
islation. 
Now, for several days, we heard some 
Senators say Congress must send more 
cash to high-earning households that 
haven’t seen any income disruption 
during COVID–19. Our colleagues who 
purport to be the champions of vulner-
able Americans now say that what 
struggling people really need is for 
Congress to stop focusing on targeted 
relief for them specifically and, in-
stead, to send thousands of dollars to 
people who don’t need the help. 
Experts from across the political 
spectrum agree that our colleague from 
Vermont is dead wrong on this. Social-
ism for rich people is a terrible way to 
help the American families who are ac-
tually struggling. Let me say that 
again. Borrowing from our grandkids 
to do socialism for rich people is a ter-
rible way to get help for families who 
actually need it. 
Washington Democrats took Presi-
dent Trump’s suggestion and skewed it 
so the checks would benefit even more 
high-earning households. 
Imagine a family of five where the 
parents earn $250,000 per year and have 
not seen any income loss this past 
year. Speaker PELOSI
and Senator 
SANDERS want to send them $5,000 from 
Uncle Sam. They make a quarter of a 
million dollars, nobody is out of work, 
but our so-called progressive friends 
say the household needs ‘‘survival

December 31, 2020 
checks.’’ In fact, they believe a family 
of five should have to earn $350,000 be-
fore the spigot of government money 
would stop entirely. 
Socialism for rich people. That is 
what Speaker PELOSI
and Senator 
SANDERS have sketched out. A terrible 
way to help those who need it, and ex-
perts across the political spectrum 
agree. 
The liberal editors of the Washington 
Post have blasted so-called progres-
sives demanding a nontargeted give-
away that would give ‘‘huge amounts’’ 
to ‘‘perfectly comfortable families.’’ 
Larry Summers, who ran the Treas-
ury Department for President Clinton 
and the National Economic Council for 
President Obama, says there is ‘‘no 
good economic argument’’ for more 
nontargeted checks with no linkage to 
need. 
The liberal New York Times reported 
this morning that a majority of the 
households 
that 
get 
nontargeted 
checks do not end up spending them on 
urgent needs but rather just add it to 
their savings. ‘‘We know where the 
pockets of need are,’’ said one econo-
mist, 
and 
‘‘putting 
[money] 
there 
would be a much more efficient use.’’ 
Fortunately, though some of our col-
leagues seem to have forgotten, that is 
exactly what we did only a week ago. It 
has been less than 5 days since Presi-
dent Trump signed into law another 
historic bipartisan rescue package tar-
geted to Americans who actually need 
the help. 
We passed an entire second round of 
PPP loans to save small business jobs, 
targeted to the hardest hit. We re-
newed multiple kinds of additional 
benefits for unemployed workers, in-
cluding an extra $300 supplement every 
week. There are billions for targeted 
food assistance, billions for targeted 
rental assistance, and many billions of 
dollars for vaccine distribution so we 
can finally beat this virus and reopen 
the economy in full. 
These are the kinds of targeted emer-
gency programs that directly help the 
most vulnerable, and we just poured al-
most 
another 
trillion 
dollars 
into 
them, less than 5 days ago, along with 
more direct checks that are already ar-
riving in households’ accounts. That is 
what we did just 5 days ago. 
This crisis has not affected everyone 
equally. The data show that many 
upper middle-class Americans have 
kept their jobs, worked remotely, and 
remained 
totally 
financially 
com-
fortable. On the other hand, some of 
our fellow citizens had their entire ex-
istence turned upside down and con-
tinue to suffer terribly. 
We do not need to let the Speaker of 
the House do socialism for rich people 
in order to help those who need help. 
Our duty, both to struggling Ameri-
cans and to taxpayers, is to focus on 
targeted relief that will have the max-
imum impact and help the people who 
need it the most. That is what the ex-
perts say we should do. That is where 
there is broad bipartisan support, and 
that is exactly what we did less than 1 
week ago, when nearly $900 billion in 
more targeted relief was signed into 
law for our people. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The minority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 9051 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate today meets for a rare New 
Year’s Eve session for one reason and 
one reason only: The Republican leader 
has refused to allow us to vote on legis-
lation to provide the American people 
$2,000 checks. He has twice objected to 
my requests to set a time for a vote on 
the measure, claiming yesterday that 
direct stimulus checks were ‘‘poorly 
targeted,’’ bemoaning the idea that 
some of these checks might go into 
‘‘the hands of Democrats’ rich friends 
who don’t need the help.’’ Senator 
TOOMEY said much the same thing. 
Well, funny, I don’t remember the 
Republican leader and Senator TOOMEY 
complaining about how a $2 trillion 
across-the-board corporate tax cut was 
‘‘poorly targeted’’ because some large 
companies didn’t need the help. No, 
when corporations get a blanket tax 
break, that is fine by the Republican 
majority. When the average American 
gets a little help from their govern-
ment, it is ‘‘poorly targeted.’’ 
I hope that every American heard the 
objections by these Republican Sen-
ators. I hope every American who has 
their water or heat or electricity shut 
off or had eviction notices stapled on 
top of one another to their door or had 
to choose which meal to skip on a 
given day—I hope they all heard the 
reason they will not receive $2,000 
checks is because Leader MCCONNELL 
thinks it could wind up in the hands of 
‘‘Democrats’ rich friends.’’ 
Let’s be very clear. There is one way 
and only one way to pass $2,000 checks 
before the end of the year, and that is 
to pass the House bill. It is the only 
way to get the American people the 
$2,000 checks they need and deserve. 
The House is gone for the session. 
Any modification or addition to the 
House bill can’t become law. Either the 
Senate takes up and passes the House 
bill or struggling Americans will not 
get $2,000 checks during the worst eco-
nomic crisis since the Great Depres-
sion. 
Leader MCCONNELL knows this. So he 
has said that the Senate can only vote 
on a bill that combines the checks with 
other unrelated partisan policies: a re-
peal of section 230 and an investigation 
into the President’s dishonest and 
bogus claims of election fraud. 
The Republican leader claims that 
President Trump insists that all three 
issues must be addressed in one bill, 
but, of course, the President has made 
no such demand. President Trump 
couldn’t care less about how the bills 
are packaged in Congress. 
So the Republican leader has in-
vented an excuse to prevent a clean, 
up-or-down, yes-or-no vote on $2,000 
checks from coming to the floor. This 
maneuver to combine all three issues is 
intended to kill the possibility of $2,000 
checks ever becoming law. 
Just to prove it, let me make this 
offer to the Republican majority. We 
are willing to vote on the other issues 
that President Trump mentioned—all 
the issues the Republican leader says 
must be addressed—so long as we vote 
on them separately. That way, $2,000 
checks could become law, and we could 
debate all the President’s supposed 
concerns. 
We can vote on setting up a commis-
sion to look at the President’s roundly 
rejected claims of voter fraud. We 
would also have the commission look 
at 
voter 
suppression 
and 
gerry-
mandering. That is completely unre-
lated to helping Americans pay their 
bills, but we are willing to take a look 
at the whole picture. Just give us a 
vote on the House-passed bill so we can 
get help now for people who des-
perately need it. 
Heck, we can also have a vote on re-
pealing 230. We can do it today. We will 
use Leader MCCONNELL’s exact lan-
guage. He wouldn’t agree to that be-
cause he knows his caucus wouldn’t ac-
tually support such an act. Unlike the 
President, some Members of this body 
understand what 230 means. They un-
derstand that section 230, which cer-
tainly needs change, actually enables 
the President to spew his lies. 
We all know the 117th Congress will 
have to take a close look at the rela-
tionship between liability and reckless 
speech on the internet. But if Leader 
MCCONNELL
wants a vote on these 
issues, we are here for it. Just give us 
a vote on the House-passed bill, and we 
can vote on whatever rightwing con-
spiracy theory you would like. 
We can even vote to set up a special 
blue-ribbon commission to determine 
whether Georgia’s secretary of State 
has a brother named Ron, if that would 
make our Republican friends happy. 
Just don’t let these conspiracy theo-
ries and Presidential fantasies get in 
the way of helping actual people—peo-
ple whose livelihoods have been torn 
apart by this pandemic, people whose 
lives have been torn apart by the ad-
ministration’s mismanagement of this 
pandemic, people who need just a little 
direct assistance. 
The President’s term, thankfully, 
will end in 20 days. It is a term that 
has been marked by hate and division 
and turmoil. He has so far used his 
term 
to 
enrich 
himself 
and 
the 
wealthy. 
Let’s close out the term on a good 
note. For once, he wants to help reg-
ular people, to give Americans a leg up. 
Let’s allow him to do that. 
We have a chance at the end of this 
painful year to give Americans a rea-
son to have some hope in 2021. The only

thing standing in the way is the Repub-
lican Senate majority. In a moment, I 
will, once again, ask consent that the 
Senate set a time for a vote on the 
House bill to provide $2,000 checks to 
the American people. Remember, the 
Democrats are willing to vote on all of 
the other issues that the Republicans 
say the President supposedly cares 
about. Just let us vote on a clean bill 
with the $2,000 checks. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 645, H.R. 9051, a bill to increase the 
recovery rebate amounts to $2,000 for 
individuals; that the bill be read a 
third time and the Senate vote on pas-
sage; and that if passed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.

FOR

YEAR 
2021—VETO—MOTION 
TO 
PRO-
CEED—Resumed 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will resume consideration of 
the veto message on H.R. 6395, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Veto message, a bill (H.R. 6395) to author-
ize appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for 
military activities of the Department of De-
fense, for military construction, and for de-
fense activities of the Department of Energy, 
to prescribe military personnel strengths for 
such fiscal year, and for other purposes. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 9051 AND 
H.R. 6395 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let 
me briefly respond to some of the 
points that Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL has made, to his inaccurate state-
ments. 
Now, I am delighted that, after years 
of talking on the floor of the Senate 
about socialism for the rich, appar-
ently, that has gotten across to my Re-
publican friends. Of course, that is 
what we do every single day. That is 
why we have the incredible level of in-
come and wealth inequality that exists 
in this country, because, decade after 
decade, we have used this body to pro-
vide massive tax breaks to the rich and 
provide corporate welfare to corpora-
tions that don’t need it. That is social-
ism for the rich. The majority leader is 
right, but let’s talk about, in fact, 
what is in this bill. 
According to the Tax Policy Center, 
fewer than 1 percent of the benefits of 
the direct payments—that is the $2,000 
per working-class adult that Senator 
SCHUMER
and I are talking about— 
would go to the top 5 percent of Ameri-
cans. Virtually nothing would go to the 
very, very rich. The overwhelming ma-
jority of those funds would go to the 
middle class, the working class, low-in-
come people, who in the midst of this 
pandemic are in desperate economic 
condition. 
Again, I am delighted to hear the ma-
jority leader talking about socialism 
for the rich, and I hope we will con-
tinue that discussion in the next ses-
sion. Let me talk about the socialism 
for the rich that the majority leader is 
enthusiastically supportive of as the 
majority leader helped to lead this 
body to pass Trump’s tax bill. 
Now, do you want to talk about so-
cialism for the rich, Mr. Majority 
Leader? 
Under that bill, Charles Koch—one of 
the very richest people in America, 
who has a net worth of $113 billion—re-
ceived a $1.4 billion tax break. 
Mr. Majority Leader, that sounds, to 
me, like socialism for the rich. Ah, but 
that is not all. 
In Nevada, you have a gentleman 
named Sheldon Adelson, who is a major 
contributor to the Republican Party 
and a big funder for Donald Trump. 
Under that same tax bill led by the ma-
jority leader, Sheldon Adelson received 
a $560 million tax break. A guy who is 
worth $34 billion desperately needed 
that tax break of $560 million. 
Do you want more tax breaks for the 
rich? Do you want to talk about social-
ism for the rich? 
Senator MCCONNELL had no problem 
giving a $104 million tax refund to 
Amazon over the past 3 years despite 
the fact that the company made $30 bil-
lion in profits. So the argument that 
this bill, in any significant way, bene-
fits the rich is just not accurate, but 
let us talk about whom this bill does 
benefit. 
This bill benefits tens of millions of 
Americans who, as a result of this pan-
demic, have lost their jobs and have 
lost their incomes. Some, in fact, have 
lost their lives. These are people who 
are going hungry today. We are seeing 
today a recordbreaking level of hunger 
in America—the richest country in the 
history of the world. All over this 
country—and I receive emails from 
people all over this country—people are 
frightened to death that they are going 
to be evicted from their homes. Think 
about what a $4,000 check or a $5,000 
check would mean to those struggling 
families—husband, wife, kids. In fact, 
let me give you an example. 
This is a problem taking place all 
over this country. It is taking place in 
Vermont. It is taking place in Senator 
SCHUMER’s State. It is taking place in 
Kentucky. In fact, the State of Ken-
tucky—a very beautiful State; I have 
had the pleasure of being there a num-
ber of times—a beautiful State—is the 
State in which 10 out of the 25 poorest 
counties in America exist. I am sure 
Senator MCCONNELL
is aware that, 
throughout his State, you have thou-
sands and tens of thousands of people 
living in economic desperation. I am 
talking about counties where 30 to 40 
percent of people are living in poverty 
and where many thousands of residents 
are trying to survive on less than 
$20,000 a year. 
I am just using Kentucky as an ex-
ample because that is the State Sen-
ator MCCONNELL represents, but it is 
true all over this country. 
In Kentucky, over 22 percent of the 
children are living in poverty. Do you 
think they might need a little bit of 
help? 
In the State of Kentucky, more than 
190,000 workers are making extremely 
low wages, and over a half a million 
people earn less than $15 an hour. 
Somebody might want to ask those 
people what a $2,000 check per adult 
would mean. I am talking about Ken-
tucky, and I will never forget this be-
cause I visited Kentucky and talked to 
some of the people there. Kentucky has 
suffered from a particular opioid crisis. 
I will never forget talking to a football 
coach who told me that a bunch of the 
kids on his football team were living 
with their grandparents or on couches 
because of the opioid epidemic. 
In other words, the people in Ken-
tucky, the people in New York, and the 
people in Vermont are hurting. They 
need help. 
So I say today to Senator MCCON-
NELL, the leader here, let us address 
the horrendous economic crisis facing 
tens of millions of Americans. 
The pandemic today is worse than it 
has ever been. Hopefully, hopefully, the 
vaccine will make a profound dif-
ference, but, right now, people are 
hurting, and they are looking to this 
institution. They are looking to Con-
gress. The House did the right thing. 
They are now looking to the Senate. 
They are looking to Senator MCCON-
NELL. 
After all is said and done and after 
all of the legalese—and I am going to 
be introducing some legalese in a mo-
ment—it comes down to one thing: 
Senator MCCONNELL disagrees with the 
proposal that Senator SCHUMER and I 
are making. I got it. That is fine. This 
is a democracy. He has the right to his 
point of view. I would love to have the 
debate on the floor with Senator 
MCCONNELL about this legislation. All 
that we are asking is to give us the op-
portunity to vote up or down on wheth-
er or not working families in this coun-
try should be able to receive a $2,000 
check. Senator MCCONNELL disagrees. 
Come to the floor. Tell us why you 
disagree. Then we will do what this in-
stitution is supposed to do. We will 
have a vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7988 
December 31, 2020 
The truth is, in the House, Senator 
MCCONNELL knows that 44 Republicans 
voted for the House bill, which won, by 
the way, by a 2-to-1 majority. Two- 
thirds of the House voted to make sure 
that working Americans would get a 
$2,000 check. Right here in the Senate, 
there are a number of Republicans—it 
is not clear how many—who have al-
ready gone public in saying they think 
it is a good idea that we go forward 
with the House bill. 
So all that I am asking Senator 
MCCONNELL is to give us a vote. What 
is the problem? You can vote no. By 
the way, we need 60 votes—a majority. 
There is no question in my mind that a 
majority of the Senators will vote yes, 
but because of house rules, we need 60 
votes. So we are going to have to get 48 
Democrats—that is what we have—plus 
12 Republicans. Can we get 12 Repub-
licans? I don’t know—maybe we can; 
maybe we can’t—but give us a vote. 
What is the problem? What is the prob-
lem with having the American people 
see how their Senators vote on this 
issue of such enormous importance? 
As Senator SCHUMER indicated, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL has some other con-
cerns. 
He is concerned about section 230 of 
the 1996 Federal Telecommunications 
Act. I am sure that this is absolutely 
on the minds of everybody in Vermont, 
in New York, and in Kentucky. It is 
probably all that they are talking 
about, the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act. Fine. If he wants a vote on that, 
bring it to the floor. Let’s vote on it as 
a separate bill. 
Do you want to talk about election 
security? Senator SCHUMER
is right. 
There are a lot of issues out there. I am 
concerned about voter suppression. I 
am concerned about people waiting on-
line for 5 hours to cast a vote. I am 
concerned about voter intimidation. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
has 
different 
points of view. Let’s have that discus-
sion. Put together a commission. No 
problem. Bring that bill to the floor. 
Yet everybody understands that, when 
you combine all three elements, this is 
a poison pill designed to kill that legis-
lation. 
After everything is said and done, all 
of this comes down to one simple fact: 
Will Senator MCCONNELL, the Repub-
lican leader of the U.S. Senate, allow 
this body to vote on a bill which will 
provide $2,000 per person to working- 
class families all across this country? 
That is what this whole debate is 
about. It is not whether you like the 
bill or you don’t like it. We can have 
that debate. We have 3 days left in this 
Congress. The House did the right 
thing. It is now time for the Senate to 
have that vote. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that at 3 p.m. today, Thursday, 
December 31, the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of Calendar No. 645, H.R. 
9051, to provide a $2,000 direct payment 
to the working class; that the bill be 
considered read a third time and the 
Senate vote on the passage of the bill; 
and that if passed, the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; further, that following the 
vote on H.R. 9051, the Senate resume 
consideration of the veto message on 
H.R. 6395, the National Defense Author-
ization Act, and the Senate vote on the 
passage of the bill, the objections of 
the President to the contrary notwith-
standing, all with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would like to for a moment just reflect 
on where we are at this session of the 
U.S. Senate and the choices that have 
been made. 
I want to thank Senator SANDERS 
and Senator SCHUMER for bringing this, 
with clarity, to the floor of the Senate. 
We support $2,000 as a helping hand 
to people across the United States. 
There is a limitation on the amount 
that individuals receive if they make 
more than $75,000 or if their family 
makes more than $150,000, but we are 
following the template that has been 
employed both with the CARES Act 
and with our own COVID relief act of 
just a few days ago. 
We have been told by the Department 
of the Treasury that if you want to put 
money into the hands of Americans 
who desperately need it, this is the 
best way to do it, the quickest way to 
do it. There are better ways, I am sure, 
but in a time of crisis, we need to re-
spond and respond in a timely way. 
So Senator SANDERS
and Senator 
SCHUMER have brought to the floor for 
consideration, we hope, a bill that has 
already passed the House of Represent-
atives. The significance of this is that 
the House is now in recess and not 
scheduled to return in this congres-
sional session. So whatever happens 
over here cannot be a new bill—there is 
no House to send it to and no time to 
pass it—but, rather, has to be an up-or- 
down vote on a bill that has passed the 
House as is. That is what they have 
come to the floor now for 3 straight 
days asking. 
Senator SCHUMER has asked repeat-
edly of Senator MCCONNELL, the Repub-
lican leader, a simple request: Whether 
you are for the House bill or against 
the House bill, allow the Senate to be 
the Senate. Allow us to vote on the 
bill—for those of us who support it, to 
vote on it. 
It isn’t a lock; it isn’t guaranteed 
that we are going to win and prevail 
with that vote. There are 48 Demo-
cratic Senators, and you need 60 votes. 
We need help from the other side. Four 
or five Republican Senators say they 
support it as well, but we don’t know if 
we have the 12, if all of our Members 
can be here. In this era of COVID–19, 
sadly, even some of our Senators have 
illnesses in the family, which may 
make it impossible for them to be here. 
So there is no guarantee we win, but 
there will be a guarantee that we are 
recorded and our positions are known 
to the voters across America. That is a 
simple request. Yet, time and again, 
the Republican leader, Senator MCCON-
NELL, has said no. 
I am worried about what is hap-
pening to this institution, not just in 
this instance but with what we have 
seen over the past several years. 
We will conclude this calendar year 
having voted on the floor of this U.S. 
Senate 29 times on amendments—29 in 
the course of a year in what is sup-
posedly the world’s greatest delibera-
tive body. I guess I shouldn’t com-
plain—it is a 30-percent increase over 
last year, when we voted on 22 amend-
ments in the entire calendar year. The 
Senate is out of business and out to 
lunch when it comes to legislating, and 
that is a fact. 
All we are asking for is the chance to 
legislate a $2,000 helping hand to fami-
lies across America. I have heard over 
and over again that we are just trying 
to featherbed the rich, that we are try-
ing to give big checks to rich people. 
Well, Senator SANDERS made a point on 
that earlier. Less than 1 percent of the 
money we are asking for is going to go 
to the top 5 percent. 
When it came time for tax policy and 
tax breaks, many of the people com-
plaining the loudest about $2,000 were 
giving away millions of dollars to the 
richest people in America without any 
hesitation. Well, today is another day, 
and today is a different America. 
Today, we are facing a country that is 
in the depths of the crisis created by 
COVID–19. The numbers coming back 
to us every night on the news are 
heartbreaking numbers. 
I understand—and most of us do— 
that those wonderful women and men 
who are in the healthcare business usu-
ally are very stoic and calm in report-
ing the reality of their lives. Not so 
anymore. More and more doctors and 
nurses are breaking down on television 
as they describe the scenes in emer-
gency rooms across this country. They 
describe the reality of telling families 
that they cannot be by the bedside of 
one of their loved ones who is about to 
die, and they break down in tears and 
tell us they don’t know how much 
more of this they can take. 
That is the reality of America. It is 
not an America of vastly rich people 
sitting by the swimming pool hoping 
Congress sends them more money; it is 
an America of those patients and their 
families and the people who are out of

work and the business men and women 
who have lost everything, who need a 
hand from this government. 
If there is one thing about America, 
I hope it is clear, no matter what your 
political persuasion, we are a caring 
people. If a hurricane hits Florida, I 
care about it. If a tornado hits the 
State of Nebraska, I care about it. And 
we come together on a bipartisan basis 
to help those families. Now more than 
ever, those families need us to do some-
thing significant in their lives. How 
can you see the scenes on television 
every night of the parade of cars lined 
up in Texas, in Kentucky, in Illinois, 
hoping they can get some food to give 
to their families? Are those grifters 
and chiselers who are just trying to get 
a free meal? I don’t think so. Would 
you sit in your car for an hour or two 
for food unless you really needed it? I 
think those people really need it. Many 
of them are heartbroken that they are 
in this situation. Some are even embar-
rassed—and they shouldn’t be—that 
they have been the victims of this 
economy. 
So all we are asking, Senator MCCON-
NELL, is, give us a chance to vote. You 
can vote no if you wish. Give us a 
chance to vote for the $2,000 that can 
make a difference in a person’s life; 
$4,000 for a husband and wife who are 
struggling to get by—rent checks, 
mortgage payments, car payments, 
utility bills, things that really are 
basic to families’ survival. We are try-
ing to help, and I think we should be 
given that chance. 
We have tried time and again. We 
have the support of President Trump in 
this effort, and I am glad to have it. I 
think we have enough support in this 
Chamber to come up with 60 votes. I 
pray that we will, if we are given that 
chance, and I hope the Senate Repub-
lican leader is not afraid of that out-
come. He shouldn’t be. 
He has two of his incumbent Repub-
lican Senators in a runoff election who 
have both publicly said they want to 
vote for this, and yet he stops them. He 
is the one who has put an end to their 
opportunity. Why? Shouldn’t he give 
them the opportunity to vote yes? He 
even refuses, in this situation, with 
this looming election, to bring this 
matter to the floor for an honest up-or- 
down, bipartisan vote. 
I listened to the stories that were 
told by Senator SANDERS and others 
about the plight of people in this coun-
try and how much they count on us 
and, frankly, how many of them have 
given up on us. They just don’t believe 
the Congress of the United States is in 
touch with the reality of America. 
If we are in touch with the reality in 
our home States, in our home towns, 
we should do something—something 
significant—to end this year on the 
right note. 
I plead with the Republican leader, 
who has the power. The sole Member of 
Congress of 100 Members—he has the 
power to bring this matter to a vote 
and to do it immediately, within the 
hour. We could call the Members who 
returned to Washington yesterday to-
gether, take a vote soon, in a matter of 
minutes, and know once and for all 
whether we have the 60 votes that are 
necessary to pass this measure. Then 
we can pass the override of the Presi-
dent’s veto of the Defense authoriza-
tion bill—a critical piece of legislation. 
That would be the right way to end 
this year. Let us not end it in suspense 
as to whether or not we are going to 
come to the aid and assistance of 
American families who rely on us time 
and again to be there when America 
needs a helping hand. Let’s do our job. 
Let’s fill this Chamber with Senators 
who will actually vote on an issue that 
makes a difference in the lives of 
Americans. That is what we were elect-
ed to do. We have no excuse if we fail. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
we are here in the waning hours of 2020, 
expectant and hopeful about the com-
ing year, and I want to wish all of my 
colleagues a very healthy and happy 
new year in the hope that we will ful-
fill the promise of our constituents, 
our country, our Constitution in mov-
ing forward to meet and conquer the 
pandemic that still ravages our Nation 
and to renew our economy that still is 
failing. 
We are the greatest Nation in the 
history of the world, and Americans 
are hurting. This body has taken posi-
tive and important steps toward meet-
ing this public health and economic 
crisis, as well as the hurt and harm 
that continue to plague Americans. 
In a number of important relief pack-
ages, we have helped to meet those 
needs and enabled the Nation to bridge 
the gap created by this pandemic—an 
economic gap that has become a 
chasm, a cliff that seems without end 
and, for many of our fellow citizens, a 
time of unparalleled and unanticipated 
pain. 
The relief package that we passed 
most recently—I think we can be proud 
to say—is the second largest in our Na-
tion’s history, and it will provide a sec-
ond round of paycheck protection 
loans, forgivable, becoming grants, so 
that small businesses can keep their 
doors open; more aid for our transpor-
tation and education systems; money 
to distribute the vaccine that will be a 
lifesaver for so many Americans; and 
other important aid, including a $600 
stimulus payment for every American 
who is making less than $75,000. That is 
real assistance for a family of four— 
$2,400—because every child, as well as 
adult, will receive that money. 
But all of that $906 billion is only a 
downpayment. It is a life raft, and it 
has to be followed by an even more ro-
bust, bigger, bolder package to provide 
real relief and sustenance for the sur-
vival of our economy and, literally, the 
survival of Americans who are strug-
gling to put food on the table and to 
buy medicine, pay rent and mortgages, 
clothe their children. 
We have all told our stories on the 
floor of the Senate during 2020 about 
constituents waiting in food lines, 
hurting for the funds needed to stay in 
their home or apartment and to pay for 
the medicine that is literally a matter 
of life and death. 
We have told those stories. We have 
talked about Americans who are strug-
gling. We have the opportunity now to 
do something about it, so I appeal to 
my Republican colleague very bluntly 
and simply: Give us a vote on the 
CASH Act. Let us vote on a stand- 
alone $2,000 stimulus payment bill. 
Allow every one of us to go on record 
on that $2,000 stimulus payment bill 
that would add $1,400 to that $600 al-
ready provided—not to minimize the 
importance of $600, but it is inad-
equate. It is insufficient. It is unac-
ceptable because it fails to provide the 
basic needs to meet the desperate and 
dire straits of so many Americans. 
We are talking about families who 
need that money to buy bread and 
milk, paper towels and toilet paper, 
goods and services that are necessary 
to the survival of their families. Six 
hundred dollars is simply not enough, 
and that is why I call on my fellow col-
leagues to persuade their leaders that 
we should be permitted this vote, be-
cause I believe that if there is a vote, 
it will pass. Having spoken to Repub-
lican colleagues here, I have no doubt— 
none—that the stand-alone $2,000 stim-
ulus payment measure would pass over-
whelmingly, just as did the $600 pay-
ment as part of the larger bill. 
The simple fact is, that measure is 
the only viable vehicle. Any other 
measure loaded with other provisions, 
whether it is the section 230 reform or 
a commission to investigate the last 
election on fictitious fraud, is doomed. 
It is doomed logistically. It is doomed 
legally and physically. There is no way 
for the House to pass it. 
Only the House bill, if passed, can 
provide Americans with the $2,000 stim-
ulus payment that they so desperately 
need. Only the House bill provides that 
relief. Any other measure will be 
doomed because the House cannot 
come back to pass it in the time we 
have left in this session. So the major-
ity leader is essentially blocking a step 
that will literally save lives, supported 
by the vast majority of the American 
people, a significant part of his own 
conference, and every Democrat. 
Have no doubt—every Democrat will 
vote for it. We clamored for a higher 
stimulus payment for months when the 
majority leader refused to come to the 
table and then when the President of 
the United States failed to lift a fin-
ger—he was on the golf course—when it

December 31, 2020 
might have made a difference in rais-
ing that $600 amount higher during the 
negotiating. 
Looking forward, there is a way to 
provide this relief to Americans with-
out leaving here in a contest of blame 
but in a new year of mutual congratu-
lation. Pass the $2,000 stimulus pay-
ment plan as a stand-alone, clean bill. 
I just want to say that I am probably 
the only Senator who has supported 
two measures—one of them actually 
passed by the Congress and signed by 
the President to reform section 230 and 
the other unanimously voted out of the 
Judiciary Committee. They reformed 
section 230, and I support reforming 
section 230. I have hardly been uncriti-
cal of section 230. There should be 
major reform of section 230, but it has 
to be done in a careful, deliberate, and 
considered way as a separate measure, 
not as a meat ax in a totally unrelated 
bill, the $2,000 payment bill that pro-
vides real relief for the country. 
Loading the CASH Act with poison 
pills is obstruction. It is not construc-
tive legislating, and it fails to meet the 
test of this moment. It is vital that we 
move forward to provide struggling 
Americans with this relief, and scut-
tling the $2,000 stimulus payment bill 
with a half-baked, meat-ax eviscera-
tion of section 230 is cruel and down-
right stupid. It betrays the mission and 
obligation that we have in these wan-
ing days of 2020. 
Americans need more help, and they 
need hope. Help and hope are embodied 
in the vaccine. Unfortunately, the roll-
out of this vaccine, despite the $8 bil-
lion contained in the latest pandemic 
relief bill, has been hopelessly behind 
schedule. The number of doses distrib-
uted is roughly one-tenth of what it 
should be even under the scaled-back 
schedule that this administration has 
adopted. Twenty million vaccinations 
were promised by the end of the year. 
That number was way below the initial 
promise, and only about one-tenth of 
them—probably 2 million—will actu-
ally be provided. 
Instead of taking responsibility or 
taking control, President Trump is 
still tweeting; instead of action, more 
talk. Only action will save lives, and 
either he doesn’t care enough, or he 
doesn’t really see what is necessary to 
do in order to save these lives, because 
the distribution of this vaccine is a 
matter of life and death. 
Using the Defense Production Act, 
mobilizing 
America, 
making 
sure 
States have the resources they need, 
providing money to hospitals, and 
making sure there are the vials, sy-
ringes, training for workers, as well as 
the facilities to transport, store, and 
distribute this vaccine, are essential 
now. They are missing at this moment, 
and the President is where the buck 
stops. 
Now I look forward to a 2021 when a 
new President will expand the stimulus 
payments to individuals and when 
many of the other gaps left unfin-
ished—action that still is necessary— 
will be fulfilled by another, more ro-
bust, bigger, bolder pandemic relief 
program. I hope we will have the same 
bipartisan support that we saw at the 
end of this year for the latest. I hope 
we will overcome the divisions that 
prevented us from doing what is really 
necessary and adding $1,400 to the $600 
already provided. 
We need to do more for small busi-
nesses. Yes, there will be another 
round of PPP payments, but this 
chasm faced by restaurants, retailers, 
and small businesses struggling to keep 
their doors open, keep their people on 
payroll during the holidays—we have 
seen them all and talked to them. 
Their stories are riveting and heart-
breaking. Businesspeople have poured 
their hearts and souls and lives into 
these businesses, only to see them 
threatened with extinction. 
This crisis has a racial justice aspect 
that cannot be ignored because dis-
proportionately, the businesses that 
have failed are Black- and Brown- 
owned. Disproportionately, the lives 
lost have been in Black and Brown 
communities. Disproportionately, the 
jobs lost have been in those same com-
munities—Black and Brown commu-
nities that have suffered more than 
any other as a result of this pandemic. 
So we need to make sure that they re-
ceive the vaccine as well as the thera-
peutics and testing that are necessary 
to save lives. 
We are in the midst of a racial justice 
moment 
that 
affects 
policing 
and 
criminal justice, but it also affects our 
schools, where the ZIP Code of a child’s 
residence can mean the difference be-
tween a quality education or not; 
where Black and Brown communities 
suffer twice or three times the death 
rate of others as a result of this pan-
demic; where job discrimination still 
exists and where, in housing, redlining 
still afflicts these communities; and 
where environmental quality—rivers, 
lakes, air can still be disproportion-
ately contaminated and polluted in 
communities inhabited by Black and 
Brown people. 
We are here in the last day of an un-
precedented 
and 
catastrophic 
year. 
More than 342,000 of our fellow Ameri-
cans are dead as a result of this insid-
ious 
virus—over 
342,000 
gifts 
un-
wrapped, places at the table left open, 
and many of them without a final 
goodbye. This past year will go down as 
one of the hardest in our history. 
I think we all hope for a better year, 
but it will come only if we take the 
kind of action that apparently my Re-
publican colleagues are failing to pro-
vide today, which is to meet the need 
to match the moment of the desperate 
and dire straits of so many Americans. 
The failure to approve an additional 
$1,400 and pass the CASH Act is a 
haunting omission. My hope is that the 
hopes of a hurting nation will be met 
in this new year, that the calls for jus-
tice and relief will be heard, and that 
the ailing and sick—not just physically 
but emotionally—will be met. This cri-
sis has been one of physical health care 
but also mental health care, and the 
emotional strains can be seen in the 
rising rates of domestic violence, sub-
stance abuse disorder and addiction, 
and so many other areas where mental 
and emotional stress and anxiety have 
taken a toll. The hopes of a fearful and 
grieving nation rests on our shoulders, 
and we cannot let them down. 
I yield the floor.

f 
TRIBUTE TO GARY HERBERT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand 
today to honor my friend Gary Herbert, 
Governor of the State of Utah for the 
last 12 years, who, after a long career 
in public service, is now embarking on 
a really well-deserved, hard-earned re-
tirement. 
He served the State of Utah and has 
done so with great enthusiasm and 
dedication and spirit, and I am grateful 
to have worked alongside him through-
out his tenure serving our great State. 
Gary Herbert was born in American 
Fork, UT, and grew up in Orem. He 
served a 2-year mission for the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 
the east coast and later attended 
Brigham Young University, my alma 
mater. 
He first began his public service in 
college, serving in the Utah Army Na-
tional Guard for 6 years and eventually 
becoming a staff sergeant. After his 
time in the National Guard, he set up a 
real estate firm and was very success-
ful, eventually becoming the president 
of the Utah Association of Realtors. He 
also served as president of the Utah As-
sociation of Counties, by the way. 
Starting in 1990, he served as a com-
missioner on the Utah County Commis-
sion. He served there for 14 years, and 
it was at that point that he began his 
statewide service within Utah. You see, 
in 2004, when Jon Huntsman ran for the 
Governor’s seat, Gary became his run-
ning mate, running alongside Hunts-
man as his Lieutenant Governor, with 
the pair going on to win the race in No-
vember. 
It was then that I first got to know 
Gary Herbert personally, when I was 
hired to be Governor Huntsman’s gen-
eral counsel. One of my first memories 
of Gary Herbert—which, to me, seems 
like it was just the day before yester-
day—occurred when we all began mov-
ing into the Governor’s office suite, 
just the day before Herbert and Hunts-
man were sworn into office. 
Gary came in and provided us all 
with a warm welcome, but he didn’t 
stop at the welcome. He offered really 
sound and heartfelt advice about the 
importance of staying grounded as we 
were entering the political fray. He ex-
plained that long after our service and 
the Huntsman-Herbert administration 
expired, we want to be able to look 
back and be pleased about the relation-
ships that we had formed with each 
other, but especially the relationships

December 31, 2020 
that we had maintained with our fami-
lies, our children, and God. 
I soon learned that Governor Her-
bert, in addition to being wise and in 
addition to being a skilled and valuable 
statesman, was also a formidable ath-
lete. Right after he and Governor 
Huntsman were sworn in, the staff got 
together as a team several times in the 
Governor’s mansion, where we soon 
discovered there was a ping-pong table 
in the basement. I then learned the 
hard way that Governor Herbert’s ath-
letic skills, including his ping-pong 
skills, are off the charts. 
While severing Governor Huntsman, I 
always found Gary to be friendly, ap-
proachable, and always willing to tack-
le every single assignment with eager-
ness and poise. Whenever Governor 
Huntsman’s schedule became chaotic 
or changed unexpectedly, which hap-
pens in any Governor’s office or any 
Senator’s office, for that matter, par-
ticularly at certain times of the year, 
Lieutenant Governor Herbert would 
routinely be dispatched to speak on 
Huntsman’s behalf, often sending him 
to remote corners of the State and 
often at really inconvenient times. 
He never once complained. And he 
was not only willing, but he was always 
eager and happy. He felt fortunate for 
the opportunity to help. That is the 
kind of enthusiasm that the people of 
the State of Utah have benefitted from 
for so long as a result of Gary Herbert’s 
service. You see, he has never lost 
that—not during his entire time as 
Lieutenant Governor and not during 
his entire time as Governor. You can 
tell that he is exactly where he wants 
to be and that he feels privileged and 
he has been blessed to be able to serve 
the people of Utah. 
Likewise, whenever there was an 
issue that needed to be addressed by 
the Governor, even within the office or 
around the capitol compound, but 
where the Governor was unable to meet 
with the particular group in question, 
Gary was always assigned to the case. 
He would meet with, as he described it, 
all the different stakeholders. He would 
get together the legislators, county 
commissioners, citizens from this or 
that part of the State, lobbyists, law-
yers who may have been involved, in 
addition to other members of Governor 
Huntsman’s administration. He would 
bring them all in together, and he 
would wade through all the intricate 
and often pedestrian details of the mat-
ter. You see, he wanted to get to the 
bottom of the issue. He wanted to un-
derstand it. What is more, he had the 
skill of figuring out the best path for-
ward for all parties involved and for 
making everyone feel heard and under-
stood. If ever, whenever, there was a 
way to achieve a win-win, Gary found 
it, and he brought people to it, and 
they were always grateful as a result. 
The same traits that I saw in him as 
Lieutenant Governor would go on to 
make him an effective and beloved 
Governor himself. In office now as Gov-
ernor since 2009, Gary Herbert is cur-
rently the Nation’s longest serving 
Governor, and our State has seen excit-
ing achievement and tremendous pros-
perity with Governor Herbert at the 
helm. 
In the last 8 years, Utah has seen 
continued, steady growth in our econ-
omy, with improvements in our GDP, 
number of jobs, and unemployment 
rate. We have seen the boom of Silicon 
Slopes. 
We 
celebrated 
the 
sesqui-
centennial of the driving of the Golden 
Spike, when it was an honor to stand 
alongside Governor and Mrs. Herbert at 
that celebratory reenactment. 
On that particular occasion, Gov-
ernor Herbert and his wife Jeanette 
showed their characteristic enthusiasm 
by arriving in their finest 1869 apparel 
just to commemorate the moment, and 
it made all the difference. It made it 
all feel much more authentic. 
So, too, was it an honor to join Gary 
when President Trump came to Utah to 
announce his decision to shrink the 
Bears Ears National Monument, when 
we could all stand together and cele-
brate the fact that someone in Wash-
ington had heard our concerns within 
the State and saw fit to redraw the 
boundaries in a manner more compat-
ible with local interests and concerns. 
Through his enthusiasm and his zeal, 
Gary Herbert has championed our 
State and the things that we stand for. 
He has done so very consistently and 
very enthusiastically. He can rattle off 
figures and metrics about Utah at the 
drop of a hat. I am convinced this man 
can do it in his sleep and do so infec-
tiously and persuasively. And he is a 
compelling spokesman for our State’s 
values. 
His spirit has helped Utah to attract 
talent and investment not only from 
throughout the United States but from 
throughout the world and to make it 
the good place that it is to live. 
Not only that, but Gary has been an 
instrumental partner in supporting ini-
tiatives that reflect and strengthen the 
values of our State. To champion the 
reclamation of our lands, he signed 
into law the Utah Transfer of Public 
Lands Act. He also signed into law in-
novative criminal justice reforms in 
Utah. He was at the cutting edge of 
that movement, making a far-reaching 
impact across our State and that ended 
up having impacts elsewhere. 
In fact, his work in Utah in criminal 
justice reform helped pave the way for 
the work that Congress and President 
Trump were able to achieve at the Fed-
eral level through the passage of the 
First Step Act. 
He has been a strong supporter of 
Utah’s family culture and was helpful 
in the Senate’s work promoting the 
child tax credit during our tax reform 
discussions just 3 years ago. 
On a more personal note, Gary Her-
bert also had the wisdom to put my 
brother Tom on the Utah Supreme 
Court. In so doing, he has been a cham-
pion for textualism, the notion that 
judges are there to interpret the law 
based on what the law says, rather 
than on the basis of what it might have 
said. 
For all of his public achievements, 
Gary is perhaps most proud and always 
most conscious of and most aware of 
and most concerned about his own role 
as a husband, as a father, and as a 
grandfather. Gary and his wife Jea-
nette have 6 children together, as well 
as 16 grandchildren, and he is known to 
encourage them to ‘‘follow in his foot-
steps and marry up.’’ 
In a myriad of ways, Governor Her-
bert has been a champion and a spokes-
man for all that is good about our 
State. It has been an honor to serve the 
people of Utah with him, and I wish 
Governor Herbert and his wife Jeanette 
all the best as they embark on the next 
chapter of their lives together. 
I yield the floor.

UGANDA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise with grave concern to speak about 
the troubling political situation in 
Uganda in the runup to that country’s 
elections on January 14 and to call on 
President Museveni to take immediate 
action to stop the country’s downward 
political spiral. 
Uganda has been an important if not 
critical security and counterterrorism 
partner to the United States for well 
over a decade, playing a prominent role 
in the African Union’s Mission to So-
malia and hosting over 1.4 million refu-
gees. Its leadership and influence in 
East Africa and the African continent 
writ large is difficult to overstate. 
However, these are troubling times in 
Uganda, and longstanding efforts to ad-
vance its democracy are now in peril. 
National elections in Uganda have 
not 
met 
internationally 
accepted 
standards for free and fair polls since 
1996, when they were held for the first 
time after a long-running conflict that 
brought President Museveni to power. 
For decades, Museveni’s ruling Na-
tional Resistance Party, NRM, has le-
veraged access to and influence over

state resources and institutions to tilt 
the electoral balance in its favor. 
These efforts are not new. Under Presi-
dent Museveni’s leadership, the NRM 
successfully 
moved 
to 
change 
the 
Ugandan Constitution in 2005 to re-
move Presidential term limits and 
again in and 2017 to lift age limits. 
These 
changes 
allow 
President 
Museveni, who has been in power since 
1986, to remain in office indefinitely. 
Not only have Museveni and the NRM 
engineered a constitutional coup, they 
have undertaken a campaign of polit-
ical repression that has only become 
worse since the last general elections. 
Ugandan authorities have increasingly 
used coercive measures, including arbi-
trary arrests and detentions, torture, 
extrajudicial killings, and intrusive 
surveillance technology to intimidate 
and silence critics, place a strangle 
hold on media, and stifle political op-
position in the country. 
Leading opposition figures have been 
targeted in brazen and shocking ways. 
Members of Parliament have been ar-
rested and detained on numerous occa-
sions, and there is strong evidence to 
support their claims of being tortured 
by President Museveni’s security forces 
while in custody. Last week, prominent 
human rights attorney Nicholas Opiyo, 
along with several other attorneys, was 
arrested in what appears to be a bla-
tant act of intimidation for their inves-
tigation into killings that occurred as 
a result of the arrest of rival Presi-
dential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi 
Ssentamu in November. Just this past 
weekend, one of Kyagulanyi’s body-
guards was killed by security forces in 
a violent confrontation that also saw 
two journalists injured. Imagine that 
happening to any political candidate 
here in the United States to one of our 
colleagues as they were out on the 
campaign trail this fall. We should all 
be outraged by such acts. 
To date there have been no meaning-
ful investigations into these incidents 
and no accountability for these abuses. 
The question we must ask ourselves is, 
Why? Why has President Museveni 
failed to take swift and decisive action 
to ensure the safety and security of 
members of the Ugandan Parliament 
and other opposition figures, and bring 
those responsible to justice? Is Presi-
dent Museveni protecting particular in-
dividuals? Or perhaps direct responsi-
bility for the violence against the 
Uganda opposition lies even further up 
the chain of command? 
Journalists and nongovernmental or-
ganizations have been under pressure 
as well. Ugandan authorities continue 
to use a range of restrictive and oner-
ous administrative measures against 
NGOs, including deregistration of more 
than 12,000 mostly local NGOs in No-
vember 2019. Earlier this month, Ugan-
dan authorities froze the bank ac-
counts of some NGOs, and in the past, 
the Museveni administration has de-
nied entry and deported some leaders 
of international NGOs in what were 
clear acts of intimidation. Journalists 
working for foreign media outlets are 
now required to reregister with Ugan-
dan authorities or risk criminal pen-
alties, and some foreign journalists 
have also been deported from the coun-
try. 
Government has also attacked digital 
rights and academic freedoms. Individ-
uals with large social media followings 
are subject to onerous administrative 
regulation. Burdensome taxes have 
been imposed on social media users, 
and some individuals who have criti-
cized the Museveni administration on 
social media platforms have even been 
prosecuted. Ugandan authorities have 
taken repeated action to suppress aca-
demic freedom and intimidate students 
and faculty who have been critical of 
the Museveni administration, includ-
ing by firing and jailing professors who 
criticize the regime. 
In short, the longstanding effort to 
build democracy in Uganda is under 
grave threat, and we must take action 
in support of those defending political 
freedoms in the country. That is why I 
introduced S. Res 807. It not only con-
demns the actions of the Museveni ad-
ministration, it calls on the Secretary 
of State and the heads of relevant de-
partments and agencies of the U.S. 
Government to undertake three essen-
tial actions: first, to consider the impo-
sition of targeted sanctions and visa 
restrictions on actors involved in un-
dermining credible, transparent elec-
tions, and those who have perpetrated 
or abetted human rights abuses; sec-
ond, to work with African partners, 
like-minded 
countries, 
and 
inter-
national institutions and organizations 
to develop and implement strategies 
and actions to promote and defend 
human, civil, and political rights and 
multiparty democracy in Uganda; and 
third, to immediately conduct a review 
of U.S. assistance and cooperation with 
Uganda 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
reprioritizing such assistance should 
neutral observers determine that the 
January 2021 polls do not meet inter-
nationally accepted standards for cred-
ible elections. 
If the outcome of the elections in 
Uganda does not reflect the will of the 
people, I will be calling for the Biden 
administration to reevaluate our rela-
tionship with the Museveni administra-
tion, and I plan to pursue binding legis-
lation in the 117th Congress that builds 
on S Res 807. Uganda’s stature and im-
portance as a security partner should 
not prevent the United States from 
speaking out in support of democracy 
and taking action in support of those 
Ugandans fighting for democratic free-
doms.

CONGRATULATING DOUG 
CRANDALL ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 31, 2020 
Mr. PETERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Doug Crandall, 
who will retire at the end of this year after 13 
years with the U.S. Forest Service. The Mem-
bers and staff of the House Agriculture Com-
mittee wish to express our thanks and best 
wishes to Doug for his service. We had the 
opportunity to work closely with Doug and his 
staff as Director of Legislative Affairs for the 
Forest Service, and we’ll miss his dedication 
and professionalism. Together we’ve worked 
on several important efforts, including the 
landmark Wildfire Funding Fix in 2018, and 
most recently the Great American Outdoors 
Act. During his time with the Forest Service, 
Doug has answered the Secretary’s call sev-
eral times, serving as Acting Assistant Sec-
retary of Congressional Relations for one year, 
as well as Acting Deputy Under Secretary of 
Natural Resources and Environment. Doug 
came to the Forest Service from right here in 
the House, where he served for eight years as 
Staff Director for the Natural Resources Sub-
committee on Forests and Forest Health. Prior 
to that, Doug represented the Society of 
American Foresters, the National Forest Foun-
dation, and the American Forest and Paper 
Association. We will miss Doug’s hard work 
and we send our sincere gratitude and wish 
him all the best in retirement.

CONGRATULATING BILL DAWSON 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 31, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Bill Dawson on his 
retirement from the Georgia Ports Authority 
after more than forty years of dedicated work. 
Bill was born and raised in Brunswick, Geor-
gia, and he has been a pillar in his community 
for many years. The Georgia Ports Authority, 
which was founded in 1945, operates port fa-
cilities in the state of Georgia. Bill has been 
with them as long as they have been in Bruns-
wick. 
He was previously employed as Assistant 
Manager for the Brunswick Port Authority and 
then joined the GPA as Terminal Manager for 
Brunswick Operations. 
Throughout his career, Bill has been a pro-
fessional and a mentor to many. He has been 
known as the go-to person for the GPA cus-
tomers and community, and he set the tone 
for GPA’s business at the Port of Brunswick 
for decades. 
Bill’s contributions to GPA expanded beyond 
his job responsibilities in operations, as he al-
ways went above and beyond to oversee the 
success of GPA in many other areas such as 
sales and public relations. Although he is very 
passionate about the Georgia Ports Authority, 
he is most passionate about his grandchildren. 
I hope that Bill is able to cherish many more 
special times with them as he begins his re-
tirement. 
I wish Bill the best, and I want to thank him 
for his lasting impact on Brunswick.

CARING FOR AMERICANS WITH 
SUPPLEMENTAL HELP ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 28, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in strong support of H.R. 9051, 
the ‘‘Caring For Americans With Supplemental 
Help Act of 2020, or CASH Act, which pro-
vides an additional $1,400 in recovery pay-
ments directly to Americans, who are des-
perately struggling to get by during the twin 
disasters of COVID–19 and a faltering econ-
omy. 
Because I had seen first-hand the pain and 
devastation caused by the pandemic, in March 
of this year, during the debate on the CARES 
Act, I advocated that the amount of direct pay-
ment should be $3,000. 
Madam Speaker, I see the disparities in the 
lives of so many of my constituents who suffer 
disproportionately from medical conditions that 
make COVID–19 deadly. 
They work low wage or no wage jobs to 
make ends meet, and they have no health in-
surance and rely on community health centers 
or pubic health services for routine care. 
I call them friends and neighbors because 
they are that to me. 
I am pleased to have this opportunity to 
vote in favor of this legislation that will provide 
them with the help they need to survive and 
recover from COVID–19. 
No one is benefiting from the COVID–19 
economy. 
The U.S. poverty rate has grown at a his-
toric rate over the past five months, with 7.8 
million Americans falling into poverty after the 
expanded $600 a week in unemployment as-
sistance expired at the end of July. 
This represents the greatest increase since 
the government began tracking poverty sixty 
years ago. 
In the city of Houston, nine key service sec-
tors, accounting for 70 percent of all jobs, 
hemorrhaged more 1,343,600 jobs, which to 
average folks is another way of saying that 
more than 1.34 million persons lost their liveli-
hoods. 
Houston workers lost jobs in the following 
areas: Healthcare: 391,000; Retail: 303,600; 
Food services: 267,000; Finance: 166,000; 
Private Education: 63,400; Arts and Entertain-
ment: 37,400; Accommodations: 28,700; Air 
Transportation: 
20,200; 
Other 
Services: 
115,800. 
In addition to these positions, jobs were also 
lost in other areas, the largest of which was 
the construction industry, which shut down 
30,700 jobs. 
Professional and business services fol-
lowed, with 25,300 jobs lost, although 13,900 
were in temporary and provisional jobs in em-
ployment services; upstream oil lost 12,300 in 
March/April; and non-oil manufacturing lost 
7,700 jobs. 
Americans out of work due to COVID–19 
have generated 86 million jobless claims, with 
new claims being filed in recent weeks topping 
800,000. 
Millions of Americans who lost their jobs 
during the pandemic have fallen thousands of 
dollars behind on rent and utility bills, a clear 
warning sign that people are running out of 
money for basic needs. 
If this is not enough evidence of what is 
happening just look at the miles of vehicles 
lined up outside of food distribution centers for 
assistance, we see nightly on our television 
screens and in our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1218 
December 31, 2020 
Moody’s Analytics warned in November 
2020 that 9 million renters said they were be-
hind on rent, according to a Census Bureau 
survey. 
The Bureau of the Census reports that 
twenty-one percent of all renters are behind 
on their rent, of which twenty-nine percent are 
African American families and seventeen per-
cent are Hispanic households. 
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia’s analysis of persons who were 
employed prior to the pandemic, 1.3 million of 
these households are now, on average of 
$5,400 in debt on rent and utilities, after the 
family breadwinners lost their jobs. 
The new COVID–19 relief legislation passed 
last week by Congress and reluctantly but fi-
nally signed by the President Trump restores 
unemployment assistance, but cuts that assist-
ance from $600 a week to $300 a week with-
out consideration of the facts on the ground, 
which are that millions of Americans remain 
out of work due to COVID–19 public health 
policy, and have been without sufficient in-
come since August 1, 2020. 
Today, we have twenty million Americans 
who are receiving some kind of unemployment 
aid, and about 12 million of the unemployed 
stopped receiving their benefits. 
The nation is on the cusp of a recession 
that is in danger of becoming a double dip 
event that would plummet the economy into a 
precarious economic state that will take much 
more than a $2000 payment to each individual 
to overcome. 
These are the reasons why I will vote for 
the CASH Act—it increases direct payments to 
individuals from $600 to $2000, which will be 
of help to families struggling with the eco-
nomic impacts of COVID–19. 
COVID–19 is not waning or wearying as it 
continues its deadly work, and there are new 
reports indicating there is a new strain that is 
seventy percent more contagious. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) reported that as of December 
23, 2020, 18.17 million cases of COVID–19, 
resulting in 321,734 deaths, had been re-
ported in the United States. 
The new year will mark a terrible milestone 
for the United States—the last time we wit-
nessed death on this scale in our nation was 
during the 1918 Flu Pandemic, which recorded 
a total of 675,000 deaths in the United States. 
What the costs will be to our nation for the 
over 320,000 deaths have yet to be fully cal-
culated. 
It is a tragedy that too many households 
who have lost a member to COVID–19 are 
struggling to accept these deaths, but it is also 
the friends, co-workers, business owners, pro-
fessionals, students, teachers, wives, hus-
bands, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, and 
grandparents who also are feeling these 
losses because someone that mattered to 
them is no longer here. 
Each of these lives impacted dozens of 
other lives, too many of whom were not al-
lowed to be present with them during their 
final moments on this earth, but whose suf-
fering is too often overlooked because we un-
duly preoccupy ourselves with only the imme-
diate family. 
My deepest concerns are for the medical 
professionals who are seeing more death day 
after day than our soldiers saw on distant bat-
tlefields in foreign lands defending our nation 
going back to World War II. 
Our medical professionals and health care 
deliverers pride themselves on robbing death 
by keeping the very ill or critically injured alive 
but they are themselves wounded by each 
loss in ways that we cannot understand. 
Too many of our medical professionals are 
losing the battle with death as they attempt to 
treat extremely ill COVID–19 patients because 
they do not have access to sufficient amounts 
of essential therapies or the special trained 
staff to administer interventions that could 
save lives . 
Medical people also have not had the uni-
versal support of political leaders who are will-
ing to promote wearing of face coverings, so-
cial distancing and handwashing to limit the 
spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2) the infection 
that causes COVID–19. 
There is a hidden cost to this foolhardy dis-
regard for the seriousness of this moment in 
American history. 
My concerns are for the economic impact 
and the long-term damage to our nation’s 
health care delivery system . 
Today we will focus on the economic inju-
ries caused by COVID–19, and I look forward 
to working with my colleagues on addressing 
the systemic long-term damage caused by un-
equal access to the health care. 
Small businesses and working men and 
women of this great nation, who are the life 
blood of the economy and who pay the lion’s 
share of federal taxes now find themselves, 
through no fault of their own, in need of assist-
ance in the form of direct payments that will 
provide a bridge to them and to the economy 
for the next few weeks so that the next Admin-
istration will have time to assess and craft the 
relief package needed to get the nation over 
the last hurdles of the pandemic’s economic 
impact. 
Since the 1980s, corporate income tax reve-
nues have become a smaller share of overall 
tax revenues paid to the federal government. 
In 2017, President Trump signed into law 
P.L. 115–97, the tax scam which substantially 
and permanently changed the U.S. federal tax 
system for the wealthy and large corporations. 
Most of the changes to the individual in-
come tax system in P.L. 115–97 for those less 
well-off are temporary and scheduled to expire 
at the end of 2025, after which the rates for 
these individuals will return to what it was for 
2017. 
In contrast, many of the tax cuts made in 
P.L. 
115–97 
affecting 
corporations 
and 
wealthy individuals are permanent, in other 
words they will keep the drastic cut in cor-
porate taxes. 
The facts are that working individuals and 
small businesses support the U.S. govern-
ment’s federal tax system. 
The largest source of revenue to the federal 
government is the individual income tax, which 
in 2019, generated $1.7 trillion. 
The second-largest source of federal rev-
enue is payroll taxes, which is collected by 
employers and is often paid quarterly. 
In FY2019, payroll taxes generated $1.2 tril-
lion in federal revenue or thirty-six percent of 
the total revenue for the federal government. 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 
projects that federal income tax revenues in 
FY2020 will be $1.5 trillion, and payroll tax 
revenue will be $1.3 trillion. 
In FY2020, it is projected that about 47 per-
cent of federal revenue will be generated 
through the individual income tax. 
In FY2019, corporate tax receipts were only 
$230 billion, or nearly 7 percent of federal rev-
enue, and in FY2020, corporate tax receipts 
are expected to be $151 billion, less than 5 
percent of federal revenue. 
Receipts from other sources are also pro-
jected to increase in FY2020 to $298 billion, 
from $271 billion in FY2019, which will result 
in 9 percent of total revenue up by from the 
8 percent the previous year. 
Obligated social insurance federal program 
payments for Social Security and Medicare 
are paid through payroll taxes and are ex-
pected to generate an additional estimated 
$1.3 trillion, or 35 percent of revenue in 
FY2020. 
The $2,000 in payments to individuals will 
be used to pay bills, rent, utilities, car notes, 
or purchase needed items like food and winter 
coats, and other essentials, which will trans-
late into income for small businesses. 
All of this spending will generate local, state 
and federal tax revenue as it fuels consump-
tion and the provision of services that are still 
available through the economy. 
Overtime basic Keynesian economics has 
proven itself to be the most durable and reli-
able economic model and has repeatedly 
proven that money turning over in the econ-
omy makes more money. 
There is a reason why it is important to 
stimulate the economy during a deadly un-
checked pandemic, chief of which is to stem 
the depressing of the national and global 
economies which exacerbate negative eco-
nomic conditions. 
We know the end of the COVID–19 
pandemic’s grip on the economy is in sight 
with the development and distribution of a vac-
cine, but we are not there yet; we must help 
the American people, and our small busi-
nesses, endure until we reach seventy percent 
inoculation in the general population. 
The use of direct payments is the Keynes-
ian solution that is winning the day across the 
globe for countries able to support their 
economies in this way. 
Payments to individuals allows them and not 
the government to make spending decisions 
on their household’s essential life sustaining 
needs such as paying for housing, utility bills, 
food, and clothing which allows money they 
spend to circulate through the economy like 
blood throughout the body. 
The American people can and should be 
trusted to make decisions regarding how they 
spend the funds provided by the stimulus be-
cause they best know the needs of their own 
families. 
Consumers will spend money with small 
businesses who should have the freedom to 
pay their workers and suppliers, workers and 
suppliers will be free to buy goods from other 
businesses, and those businesses will pay 
their workers and suppliers, and so on. 
In this way, the $2,000 in spending by each 
individual is actually spent more than once as 
the effect of each dollar spent creates more 
spending. 
This is called the ‘‘money multiplier’’ effect: 
an initial increase in spending, cycles repeat-
edly through the economy and has a larger 
impact than the initial $2,000 amount spent. 
The economy needs to be inoculated 
against recession, which is what the $2,000 in 
individual payments will do, and it will need a 
booster in about thirty to sixty days. 
This is why the decision to provide a $600 
a week addition to unemployment benefits is a

good idea for those in labor markets with high 
costs of living like New York and Washington, 
D.C., but may have far out stripped the going 
rate for labor where the cost of living is much 
lower and $600 a week exceeded the going 
rate for labor. 
The Congress may need to revisit models 
for future programs of this type and provide a 
formula that is based on the actual spending 
power of funds provided so the ability of meet-
ing the cost-of-living needs can be more in 
line with the intent of the funds provided, while 
ensuring that the spending power is equal. 
This may mean that depending on where 
someone lived at the time a disaster of this 
nature was declared the amount, they would 
qualify for receiving may be different depend-
ing on the spending power of a dollar where 
they live. 
If the overwhelming majority of those who 
will receive the $2,000 payment were planning 
to deposit the funds in a bank account rather 
than spend it, then this bill would not be need-
ed, but we know this is not the case. 
For all these reasons, I urge all Members to 
join me in voting for H.R. 9051, the CASH Act, 
to increase individual payments from $600 to 
$2,000. 
FAREWELL REMARKS FOR 
CONGRESSMAN KENNY MARCHANT 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 31, 2020 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, public service 
calls us at different times and in different 
ways. Some lead with loud voices, but often 
the most significant leaders are humble folk 
who quietly and tirelessly work to serve their 
constituents. My friend KENNY MARCHANT is 
one of those great leaders, and I am proud to 
have served with him. 
Service comes natural for the Bonham, TX 
native, something he learned from his father 
Hobart, who was a barber and World War II 
Veteran. Throughout his thirty-five years of 
public service, from zoning committee and city 
council to state representative to the U.S. 
House of Representatives, KENNY has cease-
lessly worked to make both Texas and Amer-
ica great. 
Everyone that knows KENNY knows of his 
love and adornment for his family, his wife 
Donna, sons Matthew, Luke, and Kenny, Jr., 
and his daughter Dallas. But if you really want 
to see him smile, ask him about his grand-
children, Kendall, Hayden, Carolina, Sadie, 
Walker, Neyland, Conway, and Carter Bailey. 
Congressman MARCHANT served this House, 
the state of Texas, and the people of District 
24 with honor, respect, and dignity. I will 
greatly miss him on the Ways and Means 
Committee where we served together for 
many years. His impact in helping pass the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the U.S.- 
Mexico-Canada trade agreement cannot be 
understated. And, during this Congress, Con-
gressman MARCHANT was selected as Ranking 
Member of the House Ethics Committee, a po-
sition in which he continued his devotion to 
humble public service. 
I very much wish KENNY wasn’t retiring at 
the end of this Congress, but he has earned 
a well-deserved retirement. I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in congratulating our friend 
and colleague on his many years of service. 
We wish him, and the Marchant family, all the 
best on his retirement.
