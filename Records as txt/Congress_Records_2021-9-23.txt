No. 165 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-

IOWAN GOOD SAMARITANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a group of 
Good Samaritans who recently brought 
Iowa nice to Louisiana. 
Earlier this month, the New Sharon 
Fire Department of Mahaska County 
joined dozens of recovery teams from 
across the Nation to perform disaster 
relief efforts and assist in search and 
rescue operations in Louisiana after 
Hurricane Ida. 
Thanks to the generosity of the New 
Sharon and Mahaska County commu-
nity, the New Sharon Fire Department 
has aided in recovery efforts both in 
the Hawkeye State and elsewhere 
across the country for 16 years. 
In 2018 the New Sharon Fire Depart-
ment assisted local Texas recovery 
teams in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Harvey, and last year they traveled to 
help local communities that were dev-
astated by Hurricanes Laura and Sally. 
I thank the New Sharon Fire Depart-
ment and the citizens of Mahaska 
County for answering the call to serve 
and being incredible examples of the 
generosity and selflessness of Iowans. 
THE GENEROSITY OF THE QUAD CITIES BICYCLE 
CLUB 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to share an Iowa nice story 
about looking out for one of our own. 
Joseph 
Stewart, 
a 
resident 
of 
Bettendorf in Scott County, relied on 
his bicycle for years to make his 3-mile 
roundtrip commute to work every sin-
gle day, but after his bicycle broke, the 
time of his daily commute doubled. For 
over a month after losing his only 
means of transportation, Joe would 
walk in between the highway and the 
railroad tracks to make it to work, not 
missing a single day of work. This is 
when Quad Cities Bicycle Club member 
Kathy Storm noticed Joe walking with 
a big smile on his face despite his cir-
cumstances. 
The Quad City Bicycle Club is known 
for their generosity, with members do-
nating bikes to share their love of cy-
cling with other members of the com-
munity. 
After 
getting 
to 
talking, 
Kathy 
learned 
Joe’s 
situation 
and 
later 
showed up to his place of employment 
with a big surprise—a new bike that 
was donated by the club. 
It is stories like these that make us 
smile and inspire others to help their 
own neighbors. And this is just one 
small example of why Iowa is the best 
place to live, work, play, and raise a 
family. 
IRON DOME FUNDING 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak on the importance 
of the United States continuing to sup-
port our allies, specifically Israel. 
Israel has long been a key strategic 
ally for the United States. Our rela-
tionship is mutually beneficial, and it 
is important that we work to support 
them whenever we can. That means 
fully funding the Iron Dome missile de-
fense system must be a top priority of 
this Chamber. 
The Iron Dome is a mobile all-weath-
er air defense system designed to inter-
cept and destroy short-range rockets 
and artillery shells whose trajectory 
would take them to an Israeli popu-
lated area. This system is purely defen-
sive and designed to protect civilians. 
Innocent bystanders of all ethnicities, 
nationalities, and faiths rely on the 
Iron Dome for safety and protection. 
When terrorist groups like Hamas 
and Hezbollah fire thousands of rockets 
into Israel, as they did earlier this 
year, the Iron Dome system quickly de-
stroyed them and saved countless lives. 
Unfortunately, the majority wants to 
play games with this vital program. 
Earlier this week, the funding for the 
Iron Dome was stripped from the ma-
jority’s continuing resolution amid 
protests from progressive Members. 
For years, the United States has con-
sistently funded the Iron Dome on a 
strong bipartisan basis to help Israel 
defend itself from rocket attacks from 
terrorist 
organizations. 
There 
has 
never been a situation where military 
aid for Israel was held up because of ob-
jections from Members of Congress. It 
is disgraceful that the majority would 
remove the $1 billion in funding for the 
Iron Dome to appease the far left that 
seems to have taken over their agenda. 
Not funding the Iron Dome puts lives 
at risk for absolutely no reason. While 
I appreciate the majority introducing

standalone legislation to fully fund the 
system, it should not have come to this 
to ensure the safety of our allies. 
After a summer that saw 2 weeks of 
fighting between Israel and Palestine, 
it is beyond clear to me that we must 
support Israel. Israel has long been a 
U.S. ally in a region marked by decades 
of conflict and turmoil. They are a 
strong democracy and share our views 
on many issues. 
I am proud to say what many in the 
majority will not, that I firmly stand 
in support of Israel and continuing to 
build our partnership for years to 
come. 
f 
AND STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, a proud, liberated Dem-
ocrat unbought and unbossed in the 
spirit of Shirley Chisholm. 
And I rise today with a very simple 
message: Black lives still matter. It 
doesn’t matter who is in power, Black 
lives 
matter. 
The 
circumstances 
haven’t changed. Black lives matter 
wherever they happen to be. They mat-
ter in Haiti, and they matter at the 
southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, what you see here is 
despicable and reprehensible. This is 
what is happening at the southern bor-
der, persons on horses lashing out ap-
parently at persons who are from Haiti. 
Black lives still matter, and it is im-
portant to note that these persons, 
when they are rounded up apparently 
and sent back to Haiti, are given $50, a 
phone card and some food. Many of 
these persons haven’t been to Haiti in 
over a decade—over 10 years—and they 
are given $50, a phone card, and some 
food. 
Black lives matter. This has got to 
change. This is why I have introduced 
H. Res. 670. It condemns the actions 
that we have seen at the border; it con-
demns the actions. It doesn’t condemn 
the people; it condemns the actions. I 
have some personal thoughts about the 
behavior of the people and the people 
themselves, but this resolution con-
demns these actions. I believe all peo-
ple of goodwill should find these ac-
tions abhorrent and deplorable. 
I also believe that those who tolerate 
injustice—this is an injustice—those 
who tolerate injustice perpetuate in-
justice. 
I am asking that H. Res. 670 be 
brought to the floor of this House so 
that this House can go on record as op-
posing what we have seen at the border 
that is inhumane. We ought to go on 
record opposing this. 
We have gone on record opposing 
things that have been said by people 
who are within the House and without 
the House. This House has gone on 
record when we have had these seminal 
moments in time. This is another sem-
inal moment in time that requires 
some time on the floor of this House to 
show the world that we stand for jus-
tice and that this injustice should not 
stand. 
Finally, I indicated that when they 
are deported to Haiti they receive $50, 
some food, and a phone card. But here 
is something that I find appalling as 
well: Haitians have been given tem-
porary protected status in this coun-
try. Mr. Speaker, if you were here at a 
certain time prior to a certain time, 
you were given temporary protected 
status. Well, we are sending people who 
are Haitians back to Haiti who haven’t 
been there in 10 years, but there are 
others who will stay because we are 
saying that the conditions are not ac-
ceptable to send people back to Haiti. 
That contradiction has to be rec-
onciled. We shouldn’t be sending people 
to Haiti when we said that Haiti is not 
safe for us to send Haitians to. 
Mr. Speaker, Black lives still matter. 
It doesn’t matter who is in power, Mr. 
Speaker. Circumstances don’t change, 
and until they change, a liberated 
Democrat is going to continue to say 
that we must be a part of that change. 
I pray that we will have H. Res. 670 
brought to the floor so that we can 
show the world that we believe Black 
lives matter.

HONORING 
AND 
CELEBRATING 
RABBI 
MICAH 
GREENSTEIN’S 
30TH ANNIVERSARY AT TEMPLE 
ISRAEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor and congratulate a great 
Memphian and friend, Rabbi Micah 
Greenstein, who is celebrating 30 years 
of service and commitment to Temple 
Israel in Memphis and the entire Jew-
ish community. 
Rabbi Greenstein is the eighth senior 
rabbi at Temple Israel, a synagogue 
founded in the 1850s. He has served as 
senior rabbi for over 20 years and is 
now celebrating his 30th anniversary at 
Temple Israel. 
In 1991, after completing his under-
graduate and graduate degrees at Cor-
nell University, Harvard, and the He-
brew Union College-Jewish Institute of 
Religion, Rabbi Greenstein came to 
Memphis, a place he and his family 
have called home for more than 30 
years. 
Over the years, Rabbi Greenstein has 
served as two-time president of the 
Memphis Ministers Association, was 
the first rabbi to speak at the Wash-
ington National Cathedral on a major 
state day and has been named by News-
week magazine as one of the top Amer-
ican rabbis in 2012 and 2013. 
Rabbi Greenstein has been honored 
with the Memphis City Council Hu-
manitarian Award and the Memphis 
Theological 
Seminary’s 
President’s 
Humanitarian Award. As clearly dem-
onstrated, 
Rabbi 
Greenstein 
has 
worked throughout his career to make 
his community, his home in Memphis, 
and his country a better place. 
Mr. Speaker, when you speak with 
members of Temple Israel, they will 
tell you how extraordinary the con-
gregation is, and that is due to the rab-
bi’s dedication, his charisma, and his 
passion. I talked to Laurie Meskin, the 
current president of Temple Israel. She 
stated: ‘‘Rabbi Greenstein has made 
our synagogue, Temple Israel, what it 
is today. He is truly gifted at mobi-
lizing people from near and afar, is a 
great communicator and orator, and 
believes in a vibrant Jewish future for 
all of us in Memphis.’’ 
From my good friend and former 
Temple Israel president, Billy Orgel: 
‘‘Many families at Temple Israel are 
very intertwined with the Greenstein 
family, as everyone knows each other 
in Memphis. Our kids know each other 
very well and are all the same age. 
Rabbi Micah is a good friend who is 
there in sickness and in health.’’ 
He continues: ‘‘He is not just our 
rabbi, but to many in the Memphis 
community, no matter their religious 
background, he is a close friend as well. 
He is their rabbi too.’’ 
Rabbi Greenstein has forged bonds 
with numerous other religious leaders 
in Memphis and throughout the coun-
try. For example, he led Memphis’ first 
interfaith religious leaders mission to 
Israel years ago. 
Another 
friend 
of 
mine, 
Mark 
Halperin, also another former Temple 
Israel president, said: ‘‘Ultimately, the 
unique thing about Rabbi Micah is that 
he is the whole community’s rabbi. 
Temple Israel is a special place, but it 
makes it more special to have someone 
like Rabbi Micah there with us.’’ 
In a 1999 profile of the rabbi in Mem-
phis Magazine, the article cited a then 
young college-age Micah Greenstein 
finishing at Harvard’s JFK School of 
Government and deciding to switch 
studies from what he said was public 
service to Jewish service. The rabbi 
went on to say: ‘‘I’m doing exactly 
what I think God intended for me to 
do, to touch people’s lives in a Jewish 
way, to make the world more human, 
and to bring people together to share 
their differences.’’ 
Roberta and I congratulate Rabbi 
Micah, his loving wife, Sheril; and 
their three children, Cara, Jake, and 
Julia, on this incredible 30-year mile-
stone. 
We say mazel tov.

REDUCING PENTAGON BUDGET 
INCREASES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
today, we will vote on my amendment, 
Lee 41, to the FY22 National Defense 
Authorization Act to reduce from this 
year’s bill egregious Pentagon budget 
increases that were added during the 
committee markup. Our amendment 
will reduce no less than $25.5 billion

September 23, 2021 
from the bill, trimming back the total 
level of FY22 NDAA to no more than 
the amount requested by the President. 
I want to thank my cosponsors, 
starting with Congresswoman JACOBS, 
who was so kind to manage this 
amendment on the floor yesterday, for 
her 
tremendous 
leadership. 
I 
also 
thank my co-chair of the Defense 
Spending 
Reduction 
Caucus, 
Mr. 
POCAN, as well as Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ 
for working together to bring this 
amendment to the floor. I also thank 
Chairman SMITH and Mr. MCGOVERN for 
their support in helping to make this 
very important amendment in order. 
The President’s budget request is one 
of the largest in American history. For 
years now, the United States has been 
peerless in its military spending, ex-
ceeding the total spending of the next 
11 countries combined. We have numer-
ous glaring examples of waste, fraud, 
and abuse within our defense establish-
ment. Our 20-year experience in Af-
ghanistan is a stark example where the 
Special Inspector General for Afghan 
Reconstruction identified billions of 
dollars—mind you, billions of dollars— 
wasted or outright stolen over our time 
there. The taxpayers deserve better. 
Yet, Congress insists on piling more 
money into the Pentagon than our 
military leaders even ask for, despite 
DOD routinely returning unspent bal-
ances to the Treasury. 
Enough is enough. Americans are de-
manding that Congress rebalance our 
priorities and invest in the biggest 
challenges America faces. We face im-
minent threats from the COVID pan-
demic, climate change, domestic ter-
rorism, growing economic inequality, 
and systemic racial and ethnic inequi-
ties. 
While I personally support a much 
larger reduction in Pentagon spending, 
we need to draw the line somewhere. 
This amendment is a good place to 
start. I urge my colleagues to support 
this amendment, to send the message 
that Congress won’t endorse constant 
inflation of the Pentagon budget. 
Also, let me just cite amendment No. 
40, offered again this year by Mr. 
POCAN and myself, for a 10 percent cut. 
I thank our colleague, Ms. OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, for her bold leadership and for 
managing this amendment during the 
floor debate. 
Mr. Speaker, the House stands again 
poised to pour three-quarters of a tril-
lion dollars into a defense establish-
ment that is unauditable, unaccount-
able, and does little to answer the big-
gest threats to the safety and welfare 
of our people. 
The Pentagon is the only Federal de-
partment that has never passed an 
audit. I worked to get a requirement 
that DOD passes an audit written into 
permanent law a couple of years ago, 
with the help of Chairman SMITH and 
my colleague, Dr. BURGESS. Yet, still, 
the Pentagon says it won’t be able to 
pass an audit for almost another dec-
ade. 
It is not hard to find places to cut at 
the Pentagon. Earlier this year, a bi-
partisan group of organizations identi-
fied $80 billion in savings that could be 
achieved just by implementing some 
efficiencies and eliminating obsolete 
weapons, weapons like Cold War-era 
bombs and missiles designed and built 
in the last century that are totally un-
suited for the challenges of this cen-
tury. 
We see tremendous costs of this run-
away spending, not only in the missing 
priorities, like public health, that are 
left unfunded, but in a way of thinking 
that militarizes every single problem 
in our society and turns peaceful pro-
testers into targets for weapons of war. 
Let me just say, this modest reduc-
tion that we are proposing, it won’t 
compromise our national security, and 
it won’t take a dollar from our troops. 
In fact, it will put more resources into 
enhancing the quality of life for our 
troops. It will also allow us to reinvest 
in healthcare, schools, and infrastruc-
ture. 
This amendment will be a first step 
in rebalancing our priorities to build a 
safe, peaceful, prosperous world at 
home and abroad. I urge my colleagues 
to join me and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
amendment. Let’s start shifting our 
budget back to things that matter for 
most of our people. 
f 
AMERICANS FEEL BETRAYED BY 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the Amer-
ican people are outraged, and they 
have every right to be. I am outraged 
with them. 
All they have seen thus far in this 
administration 
is 
the 
buck 
being 
passed and both a President and his ad-
ministration that refuse to uphold the 
basic tenets of leadership. This admin-
istration has ruined, mishandled, and 
dissembled every issue it has touched. 
Americans are fearful that the coun-
try that they love and respect is being 
run into the ground at an alarming 
speed. Americans deserve answers, and 
our allies across the world deserve 
them as well. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans feel be-
trayed. They feel that they have been 
betrayed by their own government. 
That feeling of betrayal was extremely 
palpable when Americans were strand-
ed in Afghanistan because of an arbi-
trary deadline from the Taliban that 
this administration caved to. 
In the following days, there were no 
answers, only speculation as to how 
many Americans were still left in Af-
ghanistan who wanted to leave. Even 
now, as this administration grapples 
with how to respond to the Taliban’s 
takeover, you would be hard-pressed to 
find real answers. 
In a so-called classified briefing yes-
terday, Members got no concrete an-
swers. It was a pitiful—I am saying 
‘‘pitiful’’—display of willful ignorance 
and incompetence. 
Mr. Speaker, if you look at the past 
8 months of the Biden administration, 
that incompetence is everywhere: the 
fall of Afghanistan, our open borders, 
skyrocketing inflation, reckless spend-
ing, record levels of unemployment and 
unfilled jobs, growing national security 
threats. 
Refusing to respect the rule of law 
may be the worst, Mr. Speaker. These 
are just a few of the crises that have 
grown exponentially as the days go by. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a common 
thread that you find in each of these 
circumstances, and it is that accept-
ance of the situation and account-
ability are virtually nonexistent. 
Mr. Speaker, it is downright shame-
ful that America has been taken down 
this rocky and unsettling path, and I 
fear we may never be able to fully re-
cover. President Biden and his adminis-
tration cannot simply sweep every new 
crisis under the rug and move on, but 
based on what has happened thus far, I 
suspect we will see more of the same. 
The American people deserve better 
than abdicated leadership and a con-
sistent failure to uphold our values. 
f 
DO BETTER FOR HAITI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, as the 
Member of Congress who represents the 
Virgin Islands, the only congressional 
office within the English-speaking Car-
ibbean, the plight of my Haitian broth-
ers and sisters is very close—not just 
the ones presently enduring egregious 
and unfair treatment at the U.S.-Mex-
ico border, but our brothers and sisters 
in the nation of Haiti itself. 
The crisis unfolding before our eyes 
at the border is woefully symbolic of 
our Nation’s inconsistent and super-
ficial response to the reoccurring ca-
lamities in Haiti specifically and the 
Caribbean generally. 
The nation of Haiti faces a tremen-
dous, ongoing crisis: the recent natural 
disasters, including a major earth-
quake, tropical storms, and hurricanes; 
the effects of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
health insecurity; the assassination of 
a Prime Minister and the accom-
panying political instability; gang vio-
lence; along with large-scale deteriora-
tion of infrastructure; and poverty. 
As we watch our fellow human beings 
seeking a better life, we need to ask 
ourselves: Do they deserve the dignity 
of listening to their story, under-
standing their desperation, and work-
ing to find sustainable, long-term solu-
tions to the problems that cause tens 
of thousands of people to leave their 
country, live in abject and hostile pov-
erty in South America, and make the 
dangerous trek to try to come to 
America? 
I believe, and I think some of you do 
as well, that our Haitian neighbors de-
serve that, and that, in some ways, we 
owe them that, and that it is even in 
our own self-interests.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5098 
September 23, 2021 
We must remember that Haitians 
fought with us in the American Revo-
lution. They sent troops to be at our 
side. Then, in 1825, 20 years after they 
received their own independence, the 
United States agreed with France that 
they, as a new independent nation, 
should be forced to pay back the slave 
owners of France, who, they believed, 
needed reparations for lost income 
from slave labor. Until almost 1940- 
something, the people of Haiti have 
been paying that money back. In to-
day’s dollars, that would be over $20 
billion that this small island nation 
has paid to the people of France for 
their freedom. 
Imagine if we had been forced to pay 
England for our own independence. 
America has significant trade agree-
ments and economic support with our 
neighbors to the north and the south, 
Canada and Mexico. However, when it 
comes to our third border, the Carib-
bean, that becomes an absolute after-
thought, if they are thought of at all. 
America wants these nations to be 
stable and support them at multi-
national forums but lacks the fore-
thought to engage them as partners in 
the first instance. We intervene in po-
litical instability without meaningful 
engagement in civil society. 
Hurricane relief and support for resil-
ience, vaccination support, support for 
trade and educational alternative en-
ergy partnerships, infrastructure in-
vestments, those are the things that 
Americans should be engaged in at the 
first instance so we do not have what 
we have at the border happening now. 
China, of course, is all through the 
Caribbean, giving lasting and meaning-
ful investments there and demanding 
support from the Caribbean nations at 
the U.N., the Organization of American 
States, et cetera. 
It is well-researched fact that rural 
infrastructure investments can lead to 
higher productivity, employment, and 
economic opportunities. Solid infra-
structure powers business, encourages 
trade, provides much-needed protection 
for countries from the unpredictability 
of a natural environment, all things 
that Haiti is missing to date. 
Substantively, the U.S. has neglected 
to 
develop 
meaningful, 
substantive 
trade relationships in Haiti and the 
larger Caribbean that could help them 
and help us. We need to do better. 
f 
WORSENING BORDER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
collapse of our southern border now 
poses a mortal danger to our country. 
No civilization has ever survived the 
magnitude of mass migration that this 
administration is not only accommo-
dating but is encouraging. 
When Donald Trump left office, we 
had operational control of our borders. 
The border wall was nearing comple-
tion. Court-ordered deportations were 
finally being enforced. The Migrant 
Protection Protocols negotiated with 
Mexico reduced the number of fraudu-
lent asylum claims to a trickle. 
All that Biden needed to do was to 
continue these policies. Instead, he re-
versed them on his first day in office. 
He ordered the border wall to be aban-
doned, leaving construction gaps that 
make it useless. He ordered ICE to 
cease enforcing the law. He reversed 
the remain in Mexico policy. And he 
sent a clear and unmistakable message 
heard around the world: America is 
now a nation without borders. And na-
tions without borders aren’t around 
very long. 
The numbers are staggering. In July, 
Customs and Border Patrol encoun-
tered 212,000 foreign nationals illegally 
entering our country. That is the en-
tire population of Birmingham, Ala-
bama, in a month. In August, another 
209,000, which is Des Moines, Iowa. 
There have been, already, 11⁄2 million 
such encounters this year, and the Gal-
lup organization warns us there are 42 
million people living in poverty in 
Latin America and the Caribbean who 
intend to come here if they can. And 
they are. 
Almost overnight last week, 15,000 
Haitian nationals illegally crossed the 
border and set up camp in Del Rio, 
Texas. It is reported that DHS is track-
ing an additional 40,000 to 60,000 Hai-
tian migrants between Colombia and 
the U.S. border. Contrary to claims by 
the administration, only a fraction of 
them have been returned to Haiti. It 
appears the vast majority are being 
rapidly and furtively processed into 
our communities. 
b 1030 
There is no denying the fact that this 
is a deliberate policy by this adminis-
tration to fundamentally change the 
economy, politics, culture, customs, 
and institutions of the American Re-
public. 
Democrats on the Judiciary Com-
mittee just voted to grant amnesty, 
permanent legal residence, and a fast 
track to citizenship for between 8 and 
10 million foreign nationals who have 
already illegally entered our country, 
defied our laws, thumbed their noses at 
our sovereignty, and are demanding to 
stay and are expecting American tax-
payers to continue to support them. 
Eight to 10 million, we need to under-
stand what that means. Eight million 
is the entire population—every man, 
woman, and child—living in the States 
of Alaska, Maine, Delaware, Wyoming, 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Rhode 
Island, Montana, and Vermont com-
bined. 
This is at a time when real family 
earnings are declining, crime is in-
creasing, homelessness is rampant, and 
mounting debt is killing the American 
Dream of a better future for our chil-
dren. 
Is it any wonder our borders are over-
whelmed? Ask the migrants why they 
are coming. Every one of them will tell 
you it is because of Joe Biden’s prom-
ise of admission, amnesty, and citizen-
ship. 
That is why we are seeing this tragic 
and shocking trafficking of young chil-
dren, and it is going to continue until 
we secure our border and start enforc-
ing our immigration laws, which are 
already among the most liberal in the 
world. 
We are told we need to legalize those 
who illegally took Americans’ jobs as 
essential workers during the pandemic. 
The fact is, 45 percent of the entire 
workforce is considered essential by 
the government. That is hardly an ex-
clusive group. What the Democrats are 
really saying is that if you are part of 
the 55 percent of Americans they don’t 
consider essential and you lost your 
job during their leftist lockdowns, you 
will be pushed aside for those who vio-
lated our laws, broke the rules, and 
now compete in the job market that 
you are trying to get back into, while 
using your money to do it. 
Please, someone, explain to me: How 
are American workers helped by flood-
ing the labor market with another 
wave of illegal immigration? How are 
our children, who have been robbed of 
an entire year of their educations, 
helped by filling their classrooms with 
non-English-speaking classmates? How 
are our communities made safer by 
making it harder to deport criminal il-
legal aliens and gang members? How 
are our hospitals made more accessible 
by overwhelming emergency rooms 
with illegal immigrants demanding 
care? 
Mr. Speaker, people are asking me 
every day: How could this have hap-
pened to our country? And the answer 
is simple. If you voted for the Demo-
crats, this is what you voted for. And if 
you are surprised, you weren’t paying 
attention.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EMILY 
DEROCCO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of my dear 
friend, Emily Stover DeRocco, a gen-
erous spirit and dedicated public serv-
ant who inspired others to discover 
their purpose and to follow their 
dreams. 
Known 
for 
getting 
things 
done, 
Emily headed to Washington after 
graduating from Penn State Univer-
sity, determined to find a role working 
in the Federal Government, hoping to 
make a difference in the lives of every-
day Americans. 
As the Assistant Secretary of Labor 
for Employment and Training in the 
George W. Bush administration, Emily 
was instrumental in redesigning our 
country’s workforce development pro-
grams, particularly in strategically re-
aligning education and economic devel-
opment initiatives with the needs of

September 23, 2021 
the business community, workforce de-
velopment coming together with our 
manufacturing sector and, in par-
ticular, for emerging technologies. 
After leaving the Bush administra-
tion, Emily became a leader in the 
manufacturing sector when she joined 
the Manufacturing Institute as their 
president. Under her innovative leader-
ship, the institute researched and con-
firmed the changing workforce needs 
and, in response, implemented national 
strategy on education and workforce 
reform. 
Emily founded E3, an aptly named 
consulting firm—educate, engage, em-
ploy—focused on helping others by 
linking education, workforce, and eco-
nomic development, yet again har-
nessing her creativity and her special, 
keen ability to connect people and 
bring them together. 
In addition to her incredible career, 
Emily was a loving mother and wife. 
She met the love of her life while 
working full-time at the Department of 
the Interior and taking classes at 
Georgetown Law School, tenaciously 
walking across the stage while 8 
months pregnant with her incredible 
daughter, Lauren. 
Emily spent her life coaching and 
mentoring others and impacted my life 
and work tremendously. She was, in 
fact, on everyone’s speed dial. 
Her work led her to Detroit, Michi-
gan, where she collaborated and led the 
workforce development efforts for the 
Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow 
Institute, a public-private partnership 
intent on harnessing new technologies 
for our automotive sector and other in-
dustries of scale. She was the work-
force leader. 
I had the privilege of speaking on nu-
merous panels with her all over the 
country, with our friends at the NATC, 
ASME, in the defense sector, at NIMS, 
at NAM, and of course, yet again, the 
Manufacturing Institute. 
The need for workforce talent is the 
conversation of today. I met Emily in 
the middle of the Great Recession, 
when unemployment was through the 
roof, yet there were open jobs in our 
manufacturing firms all across the 
country. It is not a simple formula. 
What Emily sought to change and ad-
dress in this country by training not 
only the next generation of workers 
but an existing workforce in the 21st 
century begat many new challenges: 
the advent of the digital age and the 
combination of computer technologies 
with our old-school manufacturing de-
vices and pieces of equipment. She led 
the way. 
While she left us suddenly, she also 
left a legacy of work. We thank her so 
much for her service and her inspira-
tion and the mark that she made on 
this country. 
RECOGNIZING UNITED STATES MA-
RINE 
CORPORAL 
KELSEE 
LAINHART 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the United States Marine 
Corporal Kelsee Lainhart on her road 
to recovery from being wounded in Af-
ghanistan. 
Simply put, Corporal Lainhart is a 
hero. A native of Dearborn County, In-
diana, Kelsee was assigned to secure 
the airport in Kabul. 
Sadly, tragedy struck when she and 
her brothers and sisters in uniform 
were targeted by an ISIS-K suicide 
bomber. 
We 
will 
never 
forget 
Corporal 
Lainhart’s acts of bravery that day in 
Afghanistan or her courageous fellow 
servicemembers we lost. 
REMEMBERING KAYE WHITEHEAD 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
with a heavy heart to honor a pillar of 
Indiana’s Sixth Congressional District, 
a leader in our community, and a true 
friend of the Pence family. 
Kaye Whitehead, who sadly passed 
away on September 9, 2021, served as 
president of the Delaware County Farm 
Bureau for two decades. 
Kaye also served as chair of the Dela-
ware County Republican Party and in 
various advisory capacities to Dan 
Quayle, Richard Lugar, David Mac-
Intosh, Mike Pence, and myself. 
I am grateful to Kaye for her counsel, 
guidance, 
and 
friendship 
over 
the 
years. She will be dearly missed. 
My thoughts are with her husband, 
Bill; her children, Eugene and Lucy; 
her siblings, Marie, Anne, and Chris; as 
well as her three grandchildren. 
INFLATION IS TAXATION 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in ob-
jection to the Democrats’ monster tax- 
and-spending spree that will be a det-
riment to Hoosiers back at home in In-
diana. 
I have heard from hundreds and hun-
dreds of constituents, literally, who 
have worried that this next set of 
spending bills will hurt their families 
more than they will help. 
From paying more for groceries and 
gas to being unable to find workers to 
keep the doors of their small busi-
nesses 
open, 
wasteful 
government 
spending is moving our country toward 
stagflation. 
Plain and simple, inflation is tax-
ation on my constituents, on all Amer-
icans, and I urge my colleagues to re-
ject this round of reckless Federal 
spending. 
REJECTING SOCIALIST DRUG PRICING SCHEME 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the work of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce in re-
jecting H.R. 3 by a bipartisan vote. 
Had it passed out of committee, this 
legislation would have resulted in 
fewer cures and treatments in America, 
eliminating hope for millions of people 
battling all diseases. 
It is estimated that under this social-
ist drug pricing scheme, there could be 
as many as 100 fewer cures over the 
next decade. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
reject any alternative version of this 
legislation that may come to the floor 
in the future. 
CRISIS UNFOLDING AT SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the crisis unfolding at the 
southern border. 
This is not hyperbole. Look no fur-
ther than the southern border com-
pletely overrun in chaos today. Over 1.2 
million illegal immigrants have been 
apprehended at the border since Feb-
ruary 1 of this year. 
Our communities are less safe be-
cause 
this 
administration 
stopped 
building the wall, brought back catch 
and release, and got rid of the remain 
in Mexico policy. 
This border crisis will result in per-
petuating our COVID crisis because 
this President turns a blind eye to the 
vaccine and testing status of illegal 
immigrants. 
Denying the crisis proves President 
Biden does not care or is being misled 
by his advisers. 
MOUNTING NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the mounting national cri-
sis we are seeing unfold under this 
President’s leadership. 
This week, the President desperately 
attempted to portray an image of 
strength at the United Nations, but 
nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
We have seen the failure of the Af-
ghanistan withdrawal that led to los-
ing our men and women in uniform and 
has the potential to create yet another 
refugee crisis. 
We have seen the failure to hold 
China accountable for its lack of trans-
parency and mishandling of the COVID 
pandemic. 
We have seen the failure to hold Rus-
sia accountable for its cyberattacks. 
President Biden appears weak and 
failing, and the cost is our leadership 
and national security across the world.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

Illinois (Ms. KELLY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Build Back 
Better Act, which includes significant 
investments in the fight for health eq-
uity. 
As chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus Health Braintrust, I know all 
too well that, for centuries, Black 
Americans and people of color have 
been systematically denied affordable 
healthcare access and left behind when 
it comes to our healthcare policies. No 
more. 
Healthcare access is an essential 
right, and we must do more to ensure

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5100 
September 23, 2021 
that all Americans, regardless of race, 
ethnicity, income, or ZIP Code, have 
access 
to 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare. 
I am proud that our draft of the 
Build Back Better Act takes a step to-
ward that goal. We have included sev-
eral key investments that are going to 
make a real difference in healthcare 
available to folks. These investments 
will prevent chronic illnesses like 
heart disease and diabetes, ensure ear-
lier detection and treatment of certain 
cancers, and tackle the Black maternal 
health crisis. 
There is so much good included in 
the Build Back Better Act, but today I 
want to highlight just three of the 
most urgent health equity issues this 
bill will address. 
The first of those priorities is saving 
the lives of mothers. The Build Back 
Better Act provides for a mandatory 
extension of postpartum care for new 
mothers utilizing Medicaid. In the 
American Rescue Plan, we included an 
option for States to extend postpartum 
care for 12 months after delivery. While 
some States have taken up that option, 
it will expire in 5 years. 
The Build Back Better Act goes a 
step further in making that expanded 
postpartum coverage mandatory and 
permanent. Research shows that one- 
third of all pregnancy-related maternal 
deaths occur between 1 week and 1 year 
of delivery, and Black women are at an 
increased risk of experiencing severe 
complications or death. No more. 
New mothers should have access to 
postpartum care, regardless of which 
State 
they 
live 
in. 
Extending 
postpartum care under Medicaid will 
save lives and ensure that mothers are 
able to see their babies grow up. 
Additionally, the Build Back Better 
Act includes a solution to permanently 
close the Medicaid coverage gap. There 
are still 12 States that have refused to 
expand Medicaid, and as many as 4 mil-
lion people currently lack access to 
healthcare because of the coverage gap. 
No more. 
b 1045 
Ensuring that Medicaid is available 
to everyone who needs it will reduce 
emergency room visits, allow for an in-
creased focus on preventive care and 
save us money in the long run. Closing 
the coverage gap will also help address 
the Black maternal health crisis. 
Because of the Medicaid coverage 
gap, many women are not eligible for 
care until they become pregnant, and 
by the time they get approved, they 
have missed out on weeks or even 
months of prenatal and early preg-
nancy care during these critical early 
days of pregnancy. 
Access to healthcare in the early 
days of pregnancy is crucial in detect-
ing 
and 
treating 
pregnancy-related 
complications with both mother and 
baby. Closing the coverage gap will en-
sure that new mothers have access to 
care when they need it most. 
With Build Back Better, we are tack-
ling health equity issues from babies to 
older adults. Once we pass the Build 
Back Better Act, we will begin includ-
ing dental, vision, and hearing cov-
erage for seniors through Medicare 
Part B. 
Dental coverage will include cleaning 
and x-rays, extractions, oral disease 
management services, and dentures— 
all vital dental procedures and care 
that seniors both need and deserve. 
Many people may not realize it, but 
oral health has significant impacts on 
your overall health, and poor oral 
health has been linked to heart disease, 
kidney disease, and dementia. 
Including dental coverage will help 
so many people, but it will be espe-
cially important for people of color. 
According to a Kaiser Family Founda-
tion study, 71 percent of Black Medi-
care beneficiaries and 65 percent of His-
panic beneficiaries went without a den-
tal visit in the past year, compared to 
43 percent of White beneficiaries. No 
more. 
Ultimately, these policies are not 
just about saving lives, but improving 
lives. We are investing in the health 
and safety of our constituents and 
their ability to live long, happy, and 
healthy lives with their families. 
Our healthcare system has been 
pushed to its limits throughout the 
past 18 months, and we have been 
shown, under a bright light, the cracks 
in its foundation. But it is not beyond 
repair. Through meaningful invest-
ment, we can rebuild our healthcare 
system in a way that works for every-
one and addresses centuries-long chal-
lenges to achieving health equity. 
The Build Back Better Act presents a 
once-in-a-generation opportunity for us 
to advance health equity. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
f 
CHARLESTON AIR WING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, it has been 
3 weeks since the U.S. withdrew troops 
from Afghanistan. Today, I rise to pay 
tribute to the heroes who paid the ulti-
mate sacrifice in carrying out Oper-
ation Allies Refuge, and I would like to 
especially recognize the members of 
Joint Base Charleston Airlift Wing and 
their spouses who supported the overall 
mission. 
I begin with a moment of silence for 
the 13 soldiers who selflessly gave their 
lives Hamid Karzai Airport on August 
26. 
I also am recognizing this morning 
the courageous effort of our service-
members stationed in Charleston as 
they evacuated U.S. citizens, Special 
Immigrant Visa holders, and vulner-
able populations from Afghanistan. 
With one of the largest C–17 fleets in 
the country, the Lowcountry of South 
Carolina is proud of our soldiers at 
Joint Base Charleston that were tapped 
to support our airlift efforts. Reserv-
ists in the 315th Airlift Wing even 
helped deliver a baby on board one of 
their flights. 
Back at home, Joint Base Charleston 
spouses put together pallets of sup-
plies, sending over 10,000 pounds of 
food, baby wipes, drinks, and clothing 
overseas. 
The Taliban now have control over 
Afghanistan. It has led many to ques-
tion what we have accomplished there 
over the last 20 years. 
But there is no question of the unbe-
lievable effort put forth by our airmen 
and airwomen, our veterans who served 
in Afghanistan, and those that loved 
and supported them and their families 
during the war. 
Today, I think about the 124,000 peo-
ple who now have freedom and the 
thousands of Americans and allies who 
have been safely returned home, and I 
am 
proud 
of 
the 
difference 
the 
Lowcountry has made in those efforts. 
God bless our troops, God bless the 
Lowcountry, and God bless America. 
PARRIS ISLAND 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, as the 
House continues to consider the 2022 
National Defense Authorization Act, I 
wanted to take this opportunity to 
highlight the Parris Island Protection 
Act. This critical bill will preserve 
Parris Island Marine Corps Recruiting 
Depot for decades to come. Parris Is-
land is responsible for training over a 
million brave marines, including every 
enlisted female marine that has ever 
served in our Marine Corps. 
Not only is Parris Island critical to 
our national defense, but it is also an 
integral part of the Lowcountry com-
munity. It is responsible for the cre-
ation of over 6,000 jobs and generates 
almost $800 million in economic activ-
ity every year. 
Sadly, 
this 
Congress’ 
version 
of 
NDAA is one of the first authorizations 
not to include any protections against 
base realignment and closures. I was 
disappointed to see that absent these 
usual protections, my amendment to 
protect Parris Island was not made in 
order this week as we went through 
amendments for the NDAA. 
I look forward to working with the 
House Committee on Armed Services 
to ensure Parris Island remains open, 
functional, and continues to contribute 
to the best and brightest in our na-
tional defense. 
CLEAN ENERGY WEEK 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, as National 
Clean Energy Week comes to a close, I 
rise today to bring attention to a spec-
tacular environmental protection ef-
fort in my district and the efforts of 
the 32nd annual South Carolina beach 
and river sweep, which brought volun-
teers down to clean up Old Town 
Bluffton and the May River. 
This was the single largest statewide 
volunteer cleanup of beaches, marshes, 
and waterways. We know how to take 
care of our environment in South Caro-
lina’s First Congressional District. In 
fact, across the State we have thou-
sands of volunteers participating every 
single year. South Carolina’s residents

This year we had an untold number

for the community cleanup. This im-
pact was immeasurable. Seeing our 
youngsters, our students, and our chil-
dren

RECOGNIZING THE THREAT OF 
EXTREME HEAT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN) for 
5 minutes. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
threat of extreme heat in the United 
States and applaud the action of Presi-
dent Biden in mobilizing an all-of-gov-
ernment effort to protect our vulner-
able populations from this increasingly 
common disaster. 
Climate change threatens everyone 
on this planet, and it will continue to 
do so for generations. While some re-
gions 
will 
experience 
scorching 
droughts and wildfires, others will ex-
perience catastrophic hurricanes and 
flooding. 
Environmental 
activist 
Wendell 
Berry said, ‘‘The world is not given by 
our fathers, but borrowed from our 
children.’’ The consequences of our 
past and present decisions are creating 
a dismal and desolate future for our 
children and for our children’s chil-
dren. 
Unfortunately, even if we rapidly re-
duce our carbon emissions today, our 
planet will continue to warm for some 
time. 
Heat threatens the lives of children, 
the 
elderly, 
outdoor 
workers, 
and 
more, as prolonged exposure leads to 
health risks, such as heat cramps, heat 
stroke, and of course death. 
This summer we experienced this 
new, hotter than normal heat across 
this country. In late June, the Pacific 
Northwest region experienced an ab-
normal heat wave that led to unprece-
dented numbers of deaths and hos-
pitalization. 
July was the Earth’s hottest month 
on record. 
In early August, over 80 million peo-
ple across 20 States, from Washington 
to Florida, were under excessive heat 
warnings 
and 
advisories. 
Simulta-
neously, States along the East Coast 
experienced triple-digit heat indexes as 
a combination of heat and humidity 
created hazardous and deadly situa-
tions. 
Most recently, following Hurricane 
Ida, 10 people died from heat in New 
Orleans after vulnerable residents lost 
power, and temperatures climbed to 
over 90 degrees. 
Disadvantaged 
communities 
suffer 
the most from these frequent heat oc-
currences. Communities of color and 
low-income 
communities 
dispropor-
tionately experience higher tempera-
tures than their White and wealthier 
counterparts. 
Decades of discriminate urban plan-
ning, like reducing tree cover or in-
creasing hard surfaces, have led to 
temperature disparities in our most 
vulnerable communities. 
Moreover, in many of these commu-
nities residents struggle with signifi-
cant preexisting and chronic illnesses, 
like heart disease, diabetes, and high 
blood pressure, which become fatal in 
extreme heat. 
For some Americans, higher tem-
peratures are not merely a nuisance, 
they can be deadly. I applaud President 
Biden’s recent decision to address ex-
treme heat. 
From protecting outdoor workers by 
establishing OSHA standards to ex-
panding cooling centers and cooling as-
sistance amidst heat waves, President 
Biden’s commitment to the health and 
safety of the American population is 
vital to ensure that fewer lives will be 
lost to increasing temperatures. 
Earlier this year I was proud to in-
troduce the SHADE Act, which aligns 
with the ambitious goals of President 
Biden’s extreme heat initiatives and 
addresses the heat disparity experi-
enced in disadvantaged communities. 
The SHADE Act would create a grant 
program to plant trees in formerly red-
lined districts and overburdened com-
munities. 
Thanks to the research of Dr. Jeremy 
Hoffman, Dr. Vivek Shandas, and Nich-
olas Pendleton, we now know that his-
torical discriminatory housing policies 
have long-lasting consequences, mak-
ing formerly redlined neighborhoods 
hotter 
than 
non-redlined 
neighbor-
hoods. 
Climate change is not a distant or 
slow moving threat. It is here now, and 
many Americans are battling the con-
sequences of it alone. Too many are 
losing that battle. 
While efforts to combat climate 
change must be a priority, we must 
also mitigate the impacts we are al-
ready facing. We must ensure that all 
Americans can adapt and can survive 
in this new normal.

RECOGNIZING AGNES MAY MEYER 
DRISCOLL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize one of the greatest code 
breakers in American history, Agnes 
May Meyer Driscoll. 
At the age of 29 Driscoll enlisted in 
the United States Navy in 1918 and was 
assigned to the code and signals sec-
tion. While in this unit, she helped de-
velop the machine called CM, later a 
standard enciphering device for the 
Navy in the 1920s. 
She continued her work into World 
War II, where she was a vital part in 
breaking the Japanese Navy’s JN–25b 
code, which gave Admiral Nimitz a cru-
cial advantage at the Battle of Mid-
way, a turning point in the war in the

Nicknamed Miss Aggie and Madame 
X, Driscoll retired in 1959 at the age of 
70. When she passed away in 1971, she 
was buried amongst fellow American 
heroes in Arlington National Ceme-
tery. 
Driscoll forever changed the field of 
cryptology and was rightfully inducted 
into the National Security Agency Hall 
of Honor in 2000. 
It is a pleasure to recognize her serv-
ice on behalf of the Colonel Thomas 
Hughart Chapter of the Daughters of 
the American Revolution and her great 
nephew, retired U.S. Navy Captain Vic-

Our country is immensely grateful 
for Miss Aggie’s service.

WAKE UP, AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address the most imme-
diate, but still underpublicized, crisis 
facing America today. 
No country can afford unlimited im-
migration. 
In 2018, 830,000 people were sworn in 
as new citizens, as they spent years in 
America proving they were the moral 
citizens John Adams said were nec-
essary to keep our Republic. 
Now record numbers of unvetted im-
migrants, including, we believe, over 
10,000 Haitians at the border, are flood-
ing in our country. We have been proc-
essing over 200,000 immigrants at the 
border each of the last 2 months, many 
of which are turned around; but in July 
over 100,000 immigrants were let in. 
That is in comparison to 8,000 immi-
grants being let in a year earlier. It ap-
pears in August we will be at another 
90,000 people coming in. 
Because of the flood of refugees, the 
Border Patrol must do paperwork so 
that 224 miles of the Texan border is 
largely unguarded. People I talk to in 
Border Patrol believe that the official 
number of 31,000 got-aways is probably 
understated. 
b 1100 
It is hard not to conclude that this is 
happening by design. Recently, the 
Biden administration extended tem-
porary protective status, causing drug 
cartels to inform people all around the 
world that the border is open. 
I should point out, by the way, when 
people talk about the Haitians, these 
are not people who are coming here 
from Haiti. These are Spanish-speaking 
people who already were in places like 
Chile, for example. They are not com-
ing here because they have nowhere

else to go; they have somewhere else to 
go. They are coming here because they 
received a message from the Biden ad-
ministration that we are not guarding 
our borders. 
It is apparent they feel the over 
800,000 legally vetted immigrants are 
not enough. It is kind of amazing. 
I don’t know where the press is in 
this. The press ought to wake up. Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS, other than 
her 1-day photo op, have largely ig-
nored the border. Wouldn’t you think 
they would be getting nothing but 
questions as far as what is going on, on 
the border? Why aren’t you down 
there? Why aren’t you seeing what is 
going on? This will destroy America. 
America must wake up. 
Two weeks ago in the Education and 
Labor Committee, apparently in an ef-
fort to further increase illegal immi-
gration, all 28 Democrats voted specifi-
cally to give Pell grants, which is free 
college, to illegal immigrants—it is un-
believable—while the middle-class fam-
ilies in America are forced to go tens of 
thousands of dollars in debt to get 
their college. 
We are specifically saying that if you 
come here illegally, we will give you 
free college—unbelievable—in addition 
to promises of free healthcare. It is no 
wonder that so many people are flood-
ing across our border. 
By the way, I want to give our Presi-
dent something to think of. When we 
appear so weak at the border, I think it 
tells other countries around the world 
that we are weak, as well. I don’t know 
what President wants to be known as 
the weak President, but you don’t 
think that other countries like Iran, 
groups like the Taliban, Russia, are ob-
serving this and taking the measure of 
what Joe Biden is as he lets people 
flood across the border? 
By the way, we are also finally at a 
point at which 90,000 Americans are 
dying 
every 
year 
of 
illegal 
drug 
overdoses. My local law enforcement, 
who have to deal with the families of 
the people who die largely because of 
fentanyl coming across the southern 
border, wonder why more isn’t being 
done down there. But again, it seems to 
be, well, middle-class Americans dying 
of drug overdoses, that is not the pri-
ority. So we continue to allow floods 
coming across the border. 
It has been well-publicized that ille-
gal immigrants are coming into Amer-
ica with COVID and other diseases, fur-
ther causing me to wonder about the 
sincerity of some of the things that 
President Biden has said. 
I do wonder whether or not the vac-
cine mandates at the very time that 
tens of thousands of people are flooding 
across the border every month, and I 
do have to wonder about this bizarre 
bill on Friday, which is certainly going 
to get headlines as the majority of the 
House of Representatives votes to le-
galize abortion until birth, is it an ef-
fort to cause the press and even our 
supposedly conservative news outlets 
to avert their eyes from the border, as 
they have to focus on vaccine man-
dates and 81⁄2-month abortions? 
In any event, I am calling on Amer-
ica to wake up. I realize there is not an 
election now, but you better make 
your voice heard, or we are going to 
lose the border.

RECOGNIZING JOYCE ‘‘CLARK’’ 
SCHRAM ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize one of our great 
constituents and a great friend of 
mine, Joyce ‘‘Clark’’ Schram, who 
celebrated her 90th birthday on June 
24. Joyce grew up on a farm, raising 
cows for milk and butter and chickens 
for eggs. 
To this day, Joyce remembers the 
winter day in 1936 that her father told 
them they had to give up their family 
farm. Joyce compares that day to a fu-
neral. They loaded up and moved to a 
new farm near Council Bluffs owned by 
a wealthy man who knew nothing 
about farming. The Clark family lived 
on that farm for about 3 years until 
they moved to another farm east of 
Crescent, Iowa. 
On December 7, 1941, Joyce remem-
bers celebrating her Uncle Leonard’s 
birthday when his father-in-law, who 
was listening to the radio, shouted 
from across the big dining room table: 
‘‘We are at war.’’ The room became si-
lent. A few hours later, the family 
learned of the bombing of Pearl Har-
bor. Months after this, Joyce recalls 
occasionally hearing the air raid sirens 
from Omaha and how they had to turn 
off their lights in their houses until an 
all-clear signal was given. 
Because her family had recently 
moved, Joyce had a 2-mile trek to her 
new school. She recalls her father mak-
ing a path through the timber so she 
could complete the journey on her 
pony. Joyce’s family moved once again 
to Council Bluffs, where she attended 
Thomas Jefferson High School and 
graduated in 1949. Although she grad-
uated with a scholarship, she sacrificed 
going to college so that her family 
would not struggle financially. 
Joyce then went to work at Omaha 
Standard Truck Body for a short time 
before working at an insurance com-
pany. In 1952, she quit and moved back 
to help out at her family’s farm, which 
was devastated by a flood. After help-
ing her parents for a month, Joyce was 
offered a job at Mutual of Omaha as a 
claims auditor. During this time, men 
were hired more than women, but 
many men were serving in the Korean 
war, and Joyce had the skills needed to 
fill this job role. 
That fall, Joyce met her future hus-
band, Conrad ‘‘Connie’’ Schram, short-
ly before he was deployed to Korea. 
When he returned a year later, he and 
Joyce began their courtship, married 
in 1955, and moved to a farm south of 
Valley, Nebraska. 
In 1956, their son John was born, and 
in 1957, their daughter Kathleen was 
born but tragically passed a month 
later. In 1960, they had a son, but he 
also, sadly, died at birth. Despite their 
losses, Joyce and her husband had 
more children, twin boys, Tim and 
Tom, who are both friends, and daugh-
ter Mary. 
Staying in the family business of 
farming, Joyce and her husband moved 
from a hill farm in Papillion, Ne-
braska, to the Hickey farm, which is on 
ground west of Joyce’s house in the 
Platte River, Iowa, area. They lived 
there until 1976 when they built their 
house that Joyce lives in today. 
Joyce’s husband unexpectedly passed 
in 1980, leaving Joyce to raise four chil-
dren. While her twin boys were away at 
college, her older son John took over 
the family farm. Joyce said that it was 
a miracle that the family was able to 
survive through these tough times 
after her husband’s passing. Joyce 
credits her children, her sister, Evelyn, 
and brother-in-law, Norman, for keep-
ing her strong through those tough 
months. 
Joyce went back to school briefly be-
fore working for the Sarpy County 
Election Commission, where she has 
worked for 12 years to include as the 
Sarpy County Election Commissioner. 
In 1996, she was honored and selected as 
an electoral college member and has 
been active in the Republican Party for 
35 years. 
Joyce Schram has lived an eventful, 
blessed, and full life surrounded by her 
family and many friends who love and 
adore her. It should be noted that to 
this day, Sunday dinner prepared by 
Joyce has been a staple in her home as 
long as anyone can remember, and of 
course, everyone is welcome for dinner. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, we wish Joyce all the best 
and congratulate her as she celebrates 
90 years of life.

BETTER EQUIPPING 
FIREFIGHTERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. VALADAO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, last 
year, California set a record for the 
most acres burned in a single year, 4.1 
million acres. 
Already in 2021, devastating fires 
have burned through 1.6 million acres 
of our State. Hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of residents are currently under 
evacuation orders, uncertain if they 
will have a home to return to once the 
orders are lifted. 
With another heat wave on its way, 
fighting the flames will be even more 
challenging, and the risks are even 
greater. 
Each year, California wildfires de-
stroy our communities and put first re-
sponders and our firefighters in danger. 
As these men and women sacrifice 
their safety, it is imperative we pro-
vide firefighters with the latest and

most 
advanced 
firefighting 
tech-
nologies. 
Containerized aerial firefighting sys-
tems provide ground crews with de-
pendable cover from the air by pro-
viding a rapid surge of retardant to at-
tack these fires from multiple points of 
contact. 
These fires can spread and expand at 
alarming rates, making rapid and ag-
gressive containment strategies abso-
lutely critical. 
We must provide firefighters with the 
tools and resources to do their coura-
geous work effectively and safely. 
Billions of dollars are spent each 
year on recovering and restoring the 
environment and helping to rebuild 
communities after wildfires. 
By investing in technology to in-
crease our capacity to fight fires, we 
can reduce the recovery spending and 
preserve California’s renowned park-
land and countless families’ homes and 
irreplaceable belongings. 
As 
California 
faces 
several 
dev-
astating wildfires burning through our 
communities and beloved forestland, I 
ask my colleagues and the U.S. Forest 
Service to consider investment in con-
tainerized aerial firefighting systems 
and other technologies and resources. 
We have a responsibility to protect 
our communities, our environment, 
and the firefighters who run toward 
danger and sacrifice their safety for 
the safety of others. 
To do so, we must equip these brave 
men and women with the tools they 
need. 
Again, I ask the Forest Service and 
my colleagues to examine the latest 
aerial firefighting capabilities as well 
as additional resources to protect our 
state and communities. 
f 
THOUGHTS AND TAKEAWAYS ON 
SPENDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, this 
body just spent several weeks consid-
ering a massive spending bill proposed 
by the Democrats. In my case, as a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, we went through a 4-day mark-
up considering the bill and debating 
the bill, and I want to just share some 
of my thoughts and takeaways. 
The number one takeaway is that I 
just cannot comprehend how my Demo-
crat colleagues on this bill are think-
ing. In fact, I hope the American people 
are paying attention because I have 
never seen such divergent views about 
how to create prosperity for all Ameri-
cans. I have never seen such differing 
opinions about how to do it. 
Now, I will give this to the Demo-
crats: I believe they do want to see the 
American people prosper. They want to 
help people. I know we as Republicans 
want to do that, and I hope they grant 
us that same courtesy of believing 
that. But this administration has al-
ready spent trillions of dollars in the 
past 6 months, trillions of dollars, and 
now, with this bill, they want to spend 
another $31⁄2 trillion. 
Democrats literally believe that Big 
Government is the answer. They be-
lieve Big Government will solve these 
problems and will help Americans pros-
per. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
they 
are 
disincentivizing work and advancing 
policies that increase dependence on 
the Federal Government as if they 
don’t even understand that those who 
are working and businesses creating 
jobs and prospering are the ones who 
are paying the taxes that will pay for 
these programs. I just don’t get it. 
Republicans have a far different an-
swer. We believe in the American peo-
ple. We believe in their creativity, 
their hard work, their ingenuity. We 
believe in achieving the American 
Dream. I have lived that American 
Dream. 
I was born in an Old Order Amish 
family, number 10 of 12 children. My fa-
ther was first a farmer and then a roof-
er, raising 12 children on that income. 
I was the first in my family to grad-
uate from high school. I paid for my 
own education. My parents required me 
to attend a private Christian school. 
I bought a small business when I was 
17 years old, operating out of a spare 
bedroom in my parents’ home, and 
lived the American Dream. Over 25 
years, I grew, with other family mem-
bers, that company to be a leader in 
the type of construction we were doing, 
creating jobs for hundreds of Ameri-
cans, family-sustaining jobs. 
There are stories like that all across 
this body, all across the district that I 
represent, all across the country. It is 
what we call the American Dream, the 
idea that every generation can do bet-
ter than their parents’ generation and 
their grandparents’ generation before 
them. 
I think we have a choice in this body, 
and I think the choice is clear. Will we 
allow the government to dictate every 
facet of American life, or will we renew 
our trust in the American people and 
in their freedom? That is a question 
that will determine how our kids and 
our grandkids will be able to live and 
whether they have the same opportuni-
ties that we had. 
I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, whose 
side I am on. I am on the side of the 
American people. We have already seen 
the damage done as a result of these 
policies that the Democrats have im-
plemented. 
We are seeing inflation where the 
American people are paying more for 
goods, and their paycheck is buying 
less than it did before. It is only going 
to get worse if we continue going down 
this path. These programs can only be 
paid for with more debt, printing 
money, or raising taxes on hard-
working Americans. It doesn’t work. 
b 1115 
Tell me a time in history when it has 
worked, when a country has overdeliv-
ered, overspent, and overpromised. 
Mr. Speaker, we have a choice in this 
body. 
Every 
American’s 
desire 
to 
achieve greatness is what has made our 
country the envy of the world. 
Let’s reject these policies and let’s 
put us on a path to allowing every 
American the chance to achieve their 
own American Dream.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to section 513, 529, 
and 529A of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. 
Section 513 would require our daugh-
ters to register for Selective Service, 
which is the database behind the mili-
tary draft. 
I thank Congressman GREEN and Con-
gressman DAVIDSON
for allowing me 
the opportunity to cosponsor their 
amendments to strip this provision 
from the bill. 
Unfortunately, the Rules Committee 
refused to make either amendment in 
order, meaning that Members are now 
not afforded the opportunity to vote 
their consciences on the issue of draft-
ing our Nation’s daughters. 
Since our country’s founding, women 
have played a vital role in many of the 
critical support functions in military 
forces. The choices these women made 
in raising their hands to volunteer, to 
wear the uniform, and to swear an oath 
to uphold the Constitution are com-
mendable and should be honored. How-
ever, it is unconscionable to me that 
this body would enact a provision to 
force women into registering for Selec-
tive Service. 
This would put women in a position 
where they could be called at random 
to report for duty before all registered 
males have been called in the extreme 
scenario of authorizing a draft during a 
national emergency. 
First of all, adding women to Selec-
tive Service is unnecessary. Our Nation 
has been fortunate enough through vol-
unteer enlistment to have a force that 
is battle-ready and capable of with-
standing any threat posed by our ad-
versaries. If that was not the case, we 
would not have had a completely vol-
untary military for the last 40 years. A 
draft has not been needed since the 
1970s, and I am confident that if it ever 
did get to that point, we would have 
more than enough men to satisfy the 
need for increased combatants. And 
that is the purpose of the draft, to in-
crease available combatants to replace 
combatants after casualty losses. Thus, 
this provision is nothing more than an 
attempt to search for a solution to a 
problem that would not exist. 
In 2015, combat positions were open 
to women who could meet the physical 
requirements, but only a small number 
of women were able to meet those re-
quirements because men and women 
are distinctly different and not the 
same physically.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5104 
September 23, 2021 
A 2015 study in the Journal of Ap-
plied Physiology, found that, on aver-
age, men had about 26 pounds more 
skeletal muscle mass than women. For 
example, in the Marine Corps, the 
Ground Combat Element Integrated 
Task Force found that the musculo-
skeletal rate of injury for a woman was 
nearly twice the rate of injury for a 
man. And research at the Infantry 
Training Battalion found that the rate 
of injury for an enlisted woman was six 
times the rate of injury for a man. 
More muscle means more strength and 
less injury. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has already 
upheld the constitutionality of an all- 
male draft. So why are we doing this? 
Why are we trying to draft our daugh-
ters? It is just not right. 
Secondly, I have serious concerns 
about the lack of explicit accommoda-
tion provided in the text that would be 
needed to ensure we don’t haphazardly 
draft two parents with dependents. 
While I realize the bill modernizes 
language regarding to whom the Presi-
dent is authorized to grant deferments 
from training and service, which does 
take into consideration dependents, 
there is no explicit language to prevent 
both a mom and a dad from being 
drafted. That is greatly concerning to 
me. And it should be greatly con-
cerning to all Americans. 
I believe it is an issue that should be 
addressed by this body and not one de-
termined by unelected officials at the 
Department of Defense. 
The family unit has always and al-
ways will continue to play a critical 
role in forming the posterity of our Na-
tion. And it is imperative that we 
strive to retain it to the extent within 
our power to do so and not to erode it. 
Ensuring women are never forced to 
sign up for Selective Service and, 
therefore, never drafted, would be the 
correct solution. 
I also stand in opposition to section 
529 of the NDAA, which would shred 
the due process rights of servicemem-
bers 
while 
taking 
away 
their 
unalienable Second Amendment rights. 
Just think, this section of the NDAA 
would create the equivalent of a red 
flag law in the military to eliminate 
the due process rights of servicemem-
bers who have fought to preserve those 
very rights for the rest of the country. 
That is the ultimate in hypocrisy. 
I also stand in opposition to section 
529A. It includes a prohibition that 
says an individual who engages in ex-
tremist activities or is a member of an 
extremist organization may not serve 
as a member of the Armed Forces. 
The real issue is the definition of ex-
tremism: ‘‘The terms extremist activi-
ties and extremist organization have 
the meanings prescribed by the Sec-
retary of Defense.’’ 
So it is up to the Secretary of De-
fense and, thus, under considerable in-
fluence of the administration and party 
in control to decide the meaning of the 
term. 
Mr. Speaker, this area is ripe for 
First Amendment abuse.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
O Lord our shepherd, in You we lack 
nothing. In You we are refreshed by the 
stillness of Your spirit, restored as 
with life-giving water. In You we are 
given respite in fields of tranquility, 
peaceful pastures far away from the 
troubles which pursue us. 
Yet, even when our paths are fraught 
with danger, precarious and unpopular 
crossroads, and challenging no-win sit-
uations, You strengthen our resolve 
with the hope of Your blessing. 
When we are threatened by those who 
do not know us or who do not even 
wish to understand us, we need not be 
afraid for the promise of Your protec-
tion comforts us. A table of Your gra-
cious welcome is set before us. 
Anoint us, O Lord, and allow us to 
see how abundant are Your blessings. 
You lay before us a bounty, a feast of 
Your faithfulness. 
Surely Your goodness and mercy are 
extended to us. Pursue us when we 
stray from them. Sweep us up in Your 
loving embrace when we, like sheep, 
are lost or afraid. 
Then, may the length of our days be 
spent in the delight of Your presence. 
In Your most merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

CHILDCARE IS A CRITICAL 
ECONOMIC ISSUE 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because, for too long, women in 
our workforce have struggled with al-
most insurmountable childcare issues. 
Due to our lack of investment, our 
economy has lost too many talented 
women as they try to juggle the de-
mands of work and childcare. 
After gaining significant ground in 
the seventies, eighties, and nineties, 
and expanding our workforce, and in-
creasing our GDP in the process, 
women have not made significant gains 
in the workforce in the last two dec-
ades. Two decades where women faced 
economic penalties when they were 
forced to leave the workforce due to 
lack of quality and affordable child 
care. Two decades where, if we had just 
kept pace with some of our allies, we 
would have grown our GDP by another 
$600 billion. 
I rise today because women falling 
behind is the American middle class 
falling behind. Penalizing women in 
the workforce penalizes families and 
imperils opportunities for our children. 
And this crisis has been made exponen-
tially worse by COVID. 
That is why I am calling on all my 
colleagues to support legislation to en-
sure all families have access to quality 
and 
affordable 
childcare. 
Congress 
needs to realize this is not simply a 
women’s issue or a children’s issue. 
This is a critical economic issue.

NATIONAL ESTUARIES WEEK 
(Mr. POSEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, this week 
is National Estuaries Week, a special 
time to raise awareness about the vital 
role estuaries play in our communities 
and our economies, and to encourage 
local involvement in caring for our di-
verse ecosystems. 
My home in Florida is part of an es-
tuary called the Indian River Lagoon. 
Supporting the health of our lagoon 
also supports vast economic, environ-
mental, and recreational needs of our 
communities. 
When our Nation’s estuaries are 
thriving, we know our environment, 
our fishermen, our businesses and, 
most importantly, our families are 
thriving. I encourage my colleagues to 
join us in recognizing National Estu-
aries Week and the important role es-
tuaries play in our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5105 
September 23, 2021 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the people on this floor and the 
people watching on television a very 
simple question. Do you know if I am 
carrying the COVID virus? 
In fact, do you know if the next per-
son you meet is going to be carrying 
the COVID virus? 
And the answer is, you don’t know, 
because we cannot see this virus with 
our naked eyes. And you don’t know 
how this virus is going to interact with 
your body if it comes in contact with 
you. Don’t act like you do know. 
Over 680,000 Americans have died. 
Millions more have been hospitalized, 
and many more are still suffering the 
effects of long COVID. 
In Matthew 4:7, Jesus said: Do not 
put the Lord your God to the test. 
God created the laws of chemistry 
and biology. God is not going to make 
an exception just for you for this bio-
logical virus. 
So please be humble, not arrogant, 
and talk to your doctor about the best 
way to protect yourself against this 
virus.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CORPORAL HUMBERTO SAN-
CHEZ 
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of 
my fellow Hoosier, Corporal Humberto 
Sanchez. Alongside 12 of his brothers 
and sisters in arms, Corporal Sanchez 
died in the line of duty while helping to 
evacuate Americans and allies from Af-
ghanistan. 
This young Hoosier knew the risks of 
the mission and yet, he stood in the 
face of danger to help vulnerable chil-
dren evacuate Abbey Gate at the Kabul 
airport. Instead of running from dan-
ger, he stayed at his post and finished 
the job before him. 
Corporal Sanchez exemplified the 
greatest of the American spirit, a self-
less willingness to lay down one’s life 
to serve and protect. His service is the 
starkest reminder today that freedom 
is not free. 
The American people are indebted to 
Corporal Sanchez, to each of the fallen, 
and to their families. We will never for-
get these heroes. 
f 
RAISE THE DEBT CEILING 
(Mr. WELCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, the ques-
tion before this Congress will be wheth-
er we do our duty and raise the debt 
ceiling. The question of the debt ceil-
ing is not about authorizing new spend-
ing. It is about paying our bills, and it 
is no different than if a family decided 
it was sick of paying the mortgage and 
stiffed the bank. Enormous collateral 
damage occurs to our economy and to 
our reputation. 
What is so dangerous about what is 
starting to happen in this Congress is 
that one side is embracing tactics, 
shutting down government, defaulting 
on our debt, that have the likelihood of 
collateral damage to our reputation, 
our economy, to our jobs and our pros-
perity. These tactics, shutting down 
government, defaulting on paying our 
bills, much of which have been run up 
by the Trump administration, must be 
renounced. 
Raise the debt ceiling. Pay our bills. 
Do our duty. 
f 
SAY NO TO ABORTION ON DEMAND 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, in what is, 
no doubt, a knee-jerk reaction to the 
recent legislative victory to protect 
unborn life in the State of Texas, 
Democrats have introduced the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act. However, 
we know what this piece of legislation 
really should be called, the abortion on 
demand act. 
H.R. 3755 completely strips State leg-
islatures of their autonomy to write 
the laws of their own State and will, in 
effect, make all 50 States late-term 
abortion States. 
Not only is this a gross overreach of 
the Federal authority, a direct viola-
tion of States’ rights to decide their 
own laws, it is just plain wrong. 
Provisions in H.R. 3755 include the 
elimination of laws requiring parental 
involvement in a minor’s decision to 
abort a baby, laws preventing abor-
tions based on a baby’s sex or diagnosis 
with a mental disability, as well as 
laws preventing dismemberment abor-
tions. 
It is clear that this bill has nothing 
to do with protecting women’s health; 
rather, it is the result of Democrats 
bending the knee to the unethical abor-
tion industry. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the abortion on demand act. 
f 
REBUILD OUR NATION’S 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, next week 
we can make bold investments in our 
Nation, helping families, workers, and 
communities across the country, by 
passing the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. 
Everyone, no matter where you live, 
deserves access to modern, dependable 
infrastructure 
and 
transportation, 
water, and so many other efforts that 
improve our quality of life. 
We are living off the investments our 
parents and grandparents made a gen-
eration ago. As an example, in my dis-
trict, in California’s San Joaquin Val-
ley, residents in the rural community 
of Dos Palos were living with an aging 
water infrastructure system. Last sum-
mer, in the midst of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, problems with this decades-old 
water treatment plant left them with-
out clean drinking water for 3 days. 
Residents and businesses suffered. That 
is simply unacceptable wherever you 
live in America. 
I 
was 
able 
to 
work 
with 
Assemblymember Adam Gray, and we 
were able to help secure State and Fed-
eral funding to construct a new treat-
ment plant, but this piecemeal way of 
fixing our infrastructure is not the way 
to go. 
We must pass transformative pieces 
of legislation to rebuild our Nation’s 
infrastructure, for water, for transpor-
tation, broadband, and so many an-
other investments that are deeply and 
sorely needed. Making life better for 
all Americans should be the priority of 
everyone who serves in Congress. 
The health and development of our 
communities and the economy depends 
upon this vote. I urge your support. 
f 
CALIFORNIA’S DROUGHT 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, for the 
last six weeks, I was working in my 
district, meeting with constituents and 
local officials. The top issue of concern 
was overwhelmingly centered around 
California’s drought. But this is not a 
concern to my community alone. 
Our farmers cannot continue to grow 
food for the American families without 
water. 
The 
consequences 
of 
this 
drought and for our entire Nation can-
not be understated. Even leaders out-
side of California are taking notice. 
House Natural Resources Committee 
Ranking Member BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
as 
well 
as 
USDA 
Secretary 
Tom 
Vilsack, visited the Valley in August 
to witness the absolute disaster at 
hand. It is critical that the House ma-
jority follow the lead of those who have 
seen the suffering firsthand and act im-
mediately by supporting legislation 
such as my bills, the RENEW WIIN Act 
and the NEED Water Now Act.

JUSTICE IN POLICING THE 
LOUISIANA STATE POLICE 
(Mr. CARTER of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, there were over a dozen in-
stances in the past 10 years in which 
members of the Louisiana State Police 
ignored or concealed evidence of beat-
ings and interfered with efforts to root 
out misconduct. The videos show ex-
tremely distressing scenes where pri-
marily Black Louisianans were subject 
to horrifying violence by troopers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5106 
September 23, 2021 
For years, Louisiana State Police has 
displayed blatant disregard for the ac-
countability practices regarding exces-
sive use of force. It is clear that the de-
partment will not clean up its own act. 
That is why I am calling on the De-
partment of Justice to conduct a full 
and expedited pattern-or-practices in-
vestigation on Louisiana State Police. 
Only with an in-depth investigation 
can we ensure transparency and ac-
countability. 
While the majority of officers work 
hard to protect and serve, we need Fed-
eral action to root out misconduct and 
to get those who are violators. Con-
gress can and must help by passing the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

WELCOMING PRIME MINISTER 
NARENDRA MODI 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the U.S.-India partnership is 
strong 
and 
mutually 
vital. 
It 
is 
strengthened with a vibrant Indian- 
American community assimilated with 
fantastic economic success. 
We 
are 
grateful 
Prime 
Minister 
Narendra Modi is in America to attend 
the gathering of global world leaders. 
Here are a few great examples of our 
partnership: bilateral trade reached 
$150 billion; over 2,000 American com-
panies have a presence in India; every 
U.S. State exports to India, creating 
over 260,000 jobs; Indian students en-
rolled in U.S. colleges contributed over 
$8 billion to our economy. 
An 
effective 
organization 
is 
AMCHAM India, with President Salil 
Gupte of Boeing, and William Blair, 
Ranjana Khanna, and Valerie Swope, 
who work with President KV Kumar of 
the 
Indian 
American 
International 
Chamber of Commerce, coordinating 
with Governor Henry McMaster of 
South Carolina and Consul General 
Swati Kulkarni in Atlanta. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues, moving from abroad to our 
neighborhoods. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR WOMEN’S HEALTH 
PROTECTION ACT 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I bet 
every single person on this floor 
today—every 
single 
person—knows 
someone who has had an abortion or 
exercised their constitutional right to 
reproductive healthcare. 
But that lawful right is under attack 
in the State of Texas because Repub-
licans in my home State have passed 
what is probably the most dangerous 
and draconian law that we have seen 
since Roe v. Wade. 
It literally creates a vigilante bounty 
system that allows a private citizen to 
sue anyone who knowingly aids or 
abets a procedure. 
In a State like Texas, where people 
are always professing about freedoms 
and different things like that, it is 
amazing to see conservative politicians 
wage this war against women’s rights 
and against women’s healthcare. 
I think it is deplorable. This law is 
dangerous, and it is un-Texan. 
Who it is really going to hurt is, dis-
proportionately, low-income women, 
who are going to find it harder to be 
able to leave the State to seek these 
services. 
The doctor who wrote the op-ed who 
said that he performed an abortion, I 
think that that doctor is a hero, and 
we ought to applaud him on this House 
floor today. That is why I am going to 
vote for the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act. 
f 
HONORING ROBERTO ESTRADA 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor Mr. Roberto Estrada. 
Mr. Estrada was a beloved icon in the 
Las Cruces community and recently 
lost his life to pancreatic cancer at the 
age of 84. 
Estrada learned how to press tor-
tillas at the age of 15, and for decades, 
he shared his cooking talents with en-
thusiasm and made Whole Enchilada 
Fiesta a profound success. His famous 
tortillas and food products are popular 
across a wide variety of businesses in 
New Mexico. 
From 2000 to 2010, Mr. Estrada held 
the Guinness World Record for the 
world’s largest enchilada, which was 
the centerpiece at the annual Whole 
Enchilada Fiesta. 
Apart 
from 
his 
cooking 
talents, 
Estrada was known for his humility, 
kindness, strong work ethic, and giving 
back to his community. 
He donated much of his food and 
money to those who needed it the 
most. The Las Cruces community be-
came a better place because of him. 
As a testament to the impact Mr. 
Estrada made on his community, the 
Dona Ana County Commission declared 
Wednesday, September 1, as Roberto 
Estrada Day. 
Estrada was a man of faith and fam-
ily, a proud member of the Las Cruces 
Chamber of Commerce and the Las 
Cruces Hispanic Chamber of Com-
merce. 
The Las Cruces Police Department 
honored Estrada’s legacy, saying: ‘‘The 
people who give you their food give you 
their heart.’’ 
Estrada lived his life selflessly and 
improved the lives and livelihoods of 
countless others. 
We mourn the loss of Mr. Roberto 
Estrada, honor his commitment serv-
ing others, and know that his legacy 
will be preserved forever. 
RECOGNIZING JONATHON CLARK 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Jonathon Clark, an 
outstanding resident and community 
advocate of Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District. 
Jonathon Clark was known for his 
unwavering commitment to helping 
others in need and ministering to the 
spiritual needs of his neighbors. 
Whether tending to his beautiful 
family he shared with his wife, Dawn 
Wilson-Clark; leading worship at City 
Covenant Church in Detroit; or lending 
his 
talents 
to 
several 
community 
works, he was an unbelievably beau-
tiful human being. 
In his work, he served as a mentor to 
so many of our young people, and he 
never shied away from offering them 
help and guiding them in the right di-
rection. 
He also founded an early children’s 
literacy program, called Talking is 
Teaching, as a coordinator for City 
Covenant’s summer camp. 
In honor of his memory, please join 
me in recognizing his outstanding con-
tributions to Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
ALLEN LAMB 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor retired 
Lieutenant Colonel Allen Lamb of 
Lumberton, North Carolina, and to ex-
tend him best wishes for a very happy 
90th birthday. 
Lieutenant Colonel Lamb, a deco-
rated fighter pilot, led the legendary 
Wild Weasels tasked with destroying 
North Vietnam’s air defenses, which in-
cluded Soviet-made surface-to-air mis-
sile installations. The Wild Weasels 
baited the enemy into targeting them 
with their radar, allowing their team-
mates to detect and destroy the anti- 
aircraft system. 
On December 22, 1965, Lamb was the 
first Wild Weasel to destroy one of 
these missile sites, marking a key 
event in the war and saving countless 
American lives. 
For his heroic service, Lieutenant 
Colonel Lamb received two Silver 
Stars 
and 
a 
Distinguished 
Flying 
Cross. I am honored to call him a con-
stituent. 
Happy birthday to Lieutenant Colo-
nel Lamb.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5107 
September 23, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
career of Vern Squier as he celebrates 
his retirement as president and CEO of 
the Centre County Chamber of Busi-
ness and Industry and the Centre Coun-
ty Industrial Development Corpora-
tion. 
Vern’s experience with chamber and 
economic development spans over two 
decades. He brought his knowledge and 
passion for small business to CBICC 
and CCIDC in 2011, where he served for 
a decade. 
In his time with one of the largest 
countywide chambers of commerce in 
Pennsylvania, he worked diligently to 
move the organization forward. 
Vern worked closely with Penn State 
University’s leadership and utilized the 
output of graduates and staff to build 
job and wealth creation in the commu-
nity and in our region. 
While in his role as president and 
CEO, Vern guided CBICC and CCIDC to 
become the go-to organization for busi-
nesses in our community and the 
greater Centre County region. 
I thank Vern for his service and dedi-
cation to Centre County. We wish him 
a fulfilling retirement. He has earned 
it.

TREATING COVID–19 WITH 
FENOFIBRATE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to bring an underreported 
story up for the attention of the major-
ity party, the Biden administration, 
and our press corps. 
People are debating masks and man-
datory vaccines. I talked to a local cor-
oner, and they have recently found 
most of their COVID deaths are already 
vaccinated people. 
What if we found a cure? Israeli re-
searchers 
recently 
found 
that 
fenofibrate, also called TriCor, a long- 
used anticholesterol drug, cured 14 of 
15 elderly patients with comorbidities 
who were already on oxygen with pneu-
monia in less than a week. The other 
one was cured within 14 days. It also 
dramatically 
reduced 
the 
damage 
many COVID patients suffer after the 
cure. 
Wouldn’t it be great if COVID could 
be cured for less than $20 a day? 
Fenofibrate. That is two F’s in 
fenofibrate. 
Google 
The 
Jerusalem 
Post. 
I beg the CDC or NIH to take action. 
The press should publicize this and ask 
why the politicians aren’t doing more 
to bring this to market and curing 
COVID. 
f 
BIDEN 
ADMINISTRATION 
PLANS 
TO 
INFRINGE 
ON 
AMERICANS’ 
PRIVACY 
(Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the Biden ad-
ministration’s latest plan to infringe 
on the privacy of millions of Ameri-
cans. 
Amid raging inflation and a multi-
trillion-dollar spending spree, Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats now 
want to spy on American citizens’ fi-
nancial transactions. 
This proposal would require financial 
institutions 
to 
report 
information 
about the outflows and inflows on all 
accounts with over $600 to the IRS 
every year. 
Not only would such a massive data 
collection cause large compliance costs 
for our local banks, credit unions, and 
financial institutions in Wisconsin and 
across the country, it would further 
deepen mistrust in our financial insti-
tutions and community banks. 
The 
IRS 
experiences 
1.4 
billion 
cyberattacks annually and has experi-
enced multiple data breaches. This 
leaves Americans’ most private of in-
formation vulnerable to attack and 
fraud. 
Privacy is one of the main reasons 
individuals do not open bank accounts. 
Having the government monitor and 
collect data on personal financial ac-
count transactions will further this 
distrust with financial institutions. 
Law-abiding Americans deserve the 
right to privacy over their personal fi-
nancial data. Allowing the government 
to sift through our financial records is 
a violation of our basic right to pri-
vacy. 
f 
PREVENTING VETERAN SUICIDE 
(Mr. GARBARINO asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, 
during 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Month, in honor of the American he-
roes who have lost their battles with 
PTSD, depression, and other mental 
illness. 
While suicide affects Americans from 
all walks of life, veterans commit sui-
cide at a rate that is 1.5 times higher 
than those who have not served in the 
military. According to the VA, nearly 
18 veterans take their own life each 
day, and at least 60,000 veterans died by 
suicide between 2008 and 2017. 
This is unimaginable. After surviving 
the horrors of war, veterans deserve 
our unwavering commitment to safe-
guarding their physical and mental 
health. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 1123, 
the Veteran Suicide Prevention Act, 
which directs the VA to complete a re-
view of suicides by veterans in the last 
5 years and provide recommendations 
to improve the well-being of veterans. 
Issues of mental illness can be 
nuanced and complex, but we owe it to 
our veterans to put every resource be-
hind understanding what factors lead 
to veteran suicide so that we can put a 
stop to it and save veteran lives. 
MASSIVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
past week, I was appalled to see the 
massive illegal immigration camp in 
Del Rio, Texas. 
This single camp, which has garnered 
so much attention, has been shut off 
from even being monitored by the 
media, yet it does not represent even 10 
percent of the total border violations 
this month. 
The United States is currently re-
cording the highest number of border 
arrests in over 20 years. We hit 1 mil-
lion arrests by June of this year, and at 
least 420,000 more have arrived since 
then. 
The problem is not exclusively about 
immigrants being forced from their 
homes. Illegal immigration fuels the 
drug trade and human trafficking. To 
stop this, we need to hire more immi-
gration officers, build better infra-
structure along the border, and create 
a more secure immigration process. 
Unfortunately, in this Chamber, we 
are more willing to throw billions at 
high-speed rail projects and environ-
mental mandates, even build better 
fences around the Capitol than we have 
on some portions of the border. We 
can’t muster the courage to roll even a 
single dime toward the southern border 
and its improved security. 
If the priorities of this House and the 
rhetoric of the Biden administration 
officials continue down this path, then 
the wave of illegal immigration will 
only get worse.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

(Ms. 
GRANGER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5323 
currently under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Iron Dome Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act, which provides $1 billion in 
funding for Iron Dome, Israel’s short- 
range missile defense system. 
In May, during the latest period of 
increased violence between Israel and 
Hamas, more than 4,000 rockets were 
launched from Gaza. Using radar tech-
nology and missiles to track and de-
stroy incoming rockets, the Iron Dome 
intercepted over 90 percent of the rock-
ets that would have landed in civilian- 
populated areas. This system, with 
help from Congress’ funding, saved 
thousands of lives in that month alone. 
Under the 2016 memorandum of un-
derstanding between the United States 
and Israel, the United States is com-
mitted to replenishing the Iron Dome 
so Israel can continue to defend itself 
from attack and protect its citizens. 
With the funding in this bill, the Iron 
Dome would continue to protect mil-
lions of civilians. Let me repeat, this 
funding, as the bill language clearly 
states, is limited to a system that is 
entirely defensive. And there is no 
greater demonstration of the defensive 
nature of this system than the videos 
showing the Iron Dome’s interception 
capacity. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States has 
long been committed to the objective 
of a two-state solution, Israelis and 
Palestinians living side by side in a 
lasting peace. The legislation before us 
ensures that Israel can fully defend all 
its citizens, a necessary condition for 
lasting peace. 
In the State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs funding bill passed 
by the House over the summer, we pro-
vided funding to help meet the humani-
tarian and development needs of the 
Palestinian people, another require-
ment for lasting peace. 
Peace must always be our mission. It 
will allow Israelis and Palestinians to 
reconcile their differences and heal 
their many wounds. But only through 
peace can this reconciliation and heal-
ing even begin to be achieved. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill demonstrates 
that Congress’ commitment to our 
friend and ally Israel is bipartisan and 
ironclad. It fulfills our moral impera-
tive to protect the lives of innocent ci-
vilians and helps build the foundations 
for peace. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5323, which provides 
funding for Israel’s Iron Dome system. 
I have a long record of supporting 
Israel and am proud to support this bill 
today. 
We originally secured funding for 
Iron Dome in the continuing resolution 
that was filed Tuesday morning. Unfor-
tunately, 
that 
funding 
was 
then 
stripped out to address concerns on the 
Democrat side, and a new CR was in-
troduced. 
In addition, Republicans voted for 
my motion to recommit, which could 
have addressed this issue, but the ma-
jority party was united in voting 
against it. 
Let me explain why this bill is im-
portant to pass as quickly as possible. 
Four months ago, Israel was under at-
tack from terrorists. The rocket fire 
into Israel was unprecedented. Count-
less civilian lives were saved because of 
the Iron Dome system that the United 
States has supported year after year. 
Due to the attacks this last spring, 
Iron Dome rocket interceptors need to 
be replenished. This funding is critical 
and time-sensitive. We must ensure 
Israel has what it needs to defend itself 
in the face of real and growing threats. 
Providing this funding sends an im-
portant message to Israel and those 
who wish them harm, that the United 
States stands with Israel and against 
terrorists. We must reassure our ally 
that America will never turn its back 
on the great State of Israel. 
I urge passage and reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the chair of 
the 
Defense 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I am a 
strong supporter of human rights, Pal-
estinian and Israeli rights. 
As chair of the Defense Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, Iron Dome was 
fully funded in the FY22 Defense appro-
priations bill that passed out of com-
mittee with unanimous Democratic 
support and no Republican votes. 
The CR earlier this week added lan-
guage for a billion dollars for Iron 
Dome, despite no requests received by 
me from the Biden administration. 
Madam Chair, you and I agree, this 
was a matter that could have been 
worked out in conference committee, 
but today we have this emergency bill 
in front of us. I would like to engage in 
a colloquy with the chair of the full 
committee to clarify this important 
point. 
Can any funds in this bill be used for 
the procurement of offensive weapons 
by the Government of Israel? I yield to 
my friend for an answer. 
Ms. DELAURO. I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. The answer is no, 
they cannot be used for offensive weap-
ons by the Government of Israel. On 
page 2, line 7, the bill clearly states the 
purpose, ‘‘for the procurement of the 
Iron Dome defense system to counter 
short-range rocket threats.’’ 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Thank you. This 
bill clearly states that this funding is 
purely for defensive purposes. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WOMACK), the ranking 
member of the Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this afternoon in steadfast support of 
this supplemental and of Israel. 
In the same week President Biden 
pledged to stand with our allies, his 
Democrat counterparts removed crit-
ical defense resources for our long-
standing ally and friend. We shouldn’t 
be surprised, given the openly anti-Se-
mitic sentiments and comparisons of 
Israel and America to terrorist organi-
zations expressed by some on the other 
side. 
The State of Israel has the right to 
exist free of terror. This point should 
not be controversial. The bill is simple. 
As evidenced by the colloquy just a 
minute ago, it replenishes the defen-
sive Iron Dome system. I will say it 
again. It replenishes a defensive sys-
tem. 
The Iron Dome has no offensive capa-
bility, and yet there are still members 
on the Democrat side of the aisle who 
oppose it. It was that opposition, Mr.

September 23, 2021 
Speaker, that delayed proceedings in 
this very Chamber on Tuesday, forcing 
leadership to pull Iron Dome from the 
continuing resolution, so they could 
have the votes to pass. 
Interestingly, we didn’t see the same 
visceral reaction to leaving more than 
a billion dollars’ worth of artillery in 
the hands of terrorists in Afghanistan, 
as we are seeing with this defensive 
system. 
They are openly opposing a capa-
bility that protects women and chil-
dren from terrorist rocket attacks. 
In the words of our own Speaker, it is 
about the children. 
Earlier this year, Hamas and other 
terrorist organizations launched more 
than 4,000 rockets at Israeli civilians. 
We are talking about children and fam-
ilies simply trying to live their lives. 
I hope this bill passes without opposi-
tion. That, Mr. Speaker, should be the 
standard. I urge each and every one of 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the 
chair of the Military Construction and 
Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Iron Dome Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act of 2022, which I was proud to 
help bring to the floor today. 
The United States has long supported 
critical funding to help our democratic 
ally, Israel, protect herself by herself. 
During my trips to Israel, I have been 
privileged to spend hours meeting with 
families living near the border with 
Gaza who huddle in bomb shelters de-
signed to dually function as schools. 
There you can see Israel’s geographic 
vulnerability firsthand and clearly un-
derstand the urgency of securing this 
replenishment 
funding 
for 
Israel’s 
highly effective Iron Dome missile de-
fense program. 
Israel relies on the Iron Dome to de-
fend her citizens against incoming 
rocket fire from terrorist groups like 
Hamas, Islamic jihad, and Hezbollah. 
Earlier this year when terrorist groups 
fired 4,500 rockets at Israel’s popu-
lation centers in just 11 days, the Iron 
Dome effectively intercepted 90 percent 
of 
those 
rockets, 
saving 
innocent 
Israeli and Palestinian lives. 
The system also maintains regional 
stability by preventing dangerous esca-
lation. For these reasons, I know I will 
continue to use my vote and my voice 
to maintain our Nation’s ironclad com-
mitment to Israel’s security, including 
maintaining her qualitative military 
edge, especially against emerging ter-
rorist threats. 
This is a defense system. Its whole 
purpose is to stop violence and save 
lives. By supporting this program, you 
are promoting peace. 
I am proud to have worked on a 
strategy with other pro-Israel Demo-
crats and our House leadership to en-
sure there is no question about our 
commitment to the safety and security 
of our closest ally in the Middle East, 
Israel. 
I urge the United States Senate to 
take up this urgent funding bill imme-
diately to defend our ally Israel and in-
crease prospects for peace and avoid 
the CR debt-limit debate. I thank the 
chair for bringing this important legis-
lation to the floor. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member 
of the Appropriations Committee, and 
the chair for bringing this measure to 
the floor. But to paraphrase President 
Reagan, Well, there you go again. 
Why are we here? This should have 
been in the CR, approved, or we should 
have had support for the ranking mem-
ber’s motion to recommit, but we are 
here for a supplemental appropriation 
for the Iron Dome. 
I support it, but it is disgraceful that 
we have had to come back to the House 
floor to carry on this mission. 
The Iron Dome is one of the most 
successful 
military 
and 
technology 
partnerships in world history. Earlier 
this year, the missile defense system, 
Iron Dome, saved countless lives, Mr. 
Speaker, of Israeli and Palestinian citi-
zens from relentless attack. 
In July I traveled to Israel with For-
eign Affairs Committee Chair MEEKS 
on the first U.S. congressional codel 
since the pandemic. Where was it? Our 
first visit, Jerusalem, to meet the new 
Israeli coalition government. 
Despite a change in power and a new 
governing coalition between left and 
right, there is no space, Mr. Speaker, 
between the parties in Israel that the 
number one national security threat 
continues to be Iran. 
And who funds that roaring rocket 
reign of terror flying into Israel from 
Hamas? Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, we have historically in 
this body had strong bipartisan support 
for our friend, Israel. On our trip, our 
delegation, led by Chair MEEKS, as-
sured the Israeli Government that we 
have their back and that we would con-
tinue to fund Iron Dome. I thank him 
for his critical voice. 
While this makeup vote restores the 
funding stripped by Democratic col-
leagues earlier this week, the concern I 
have is like the gentlewoman from 
Florida, 
those 
strong 
Democratic 
friends of Israel are continuing to be 
thrown under the bus on this House 
floor by the far left. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge approval. I thank 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port Israel’s right to defend herself. I 
have always voted for defensive tech-
nology, which we should invest in. 
The Congress first supported Iron 
Dome funding a decade ago after a re-
quest made by President Obama. 
In 2014 I visited Israel. I saw with my 
own eyes how the Iron Dome stopped 
rockets and saved lives. 
This year we saw the horrific launch-
ing of rockets from Gaza toward Israeli 
streets. It is never okay to target civil-
ians. 
While 
the 
deescalation 
prevailed, 
there was a tragic loss of life in Israel 
and Gaza. Extremism and vicious rhet-
oric breed instability. 
This year the U.S. rightly provided 
millions in humanitarian assistance to 
the Palestinian people. Thanks to the 
bill before us, Congress is reaffirming 
our commitment to Israel’s right to de-
fend itself. 
Iron Dome technology keeps people 
safe, and it saves lives. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
FLEISCHMANN), and I ask unanimous 
consent that he control the remainder 
of the time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today on this very important 
issue that is near and dear to my heart 
and ought to be near and dear to the 
heart of this body and the United 
States of America. 
I think the Democratic majority 
made a horrific mistake this week in 
stripping out Iron Dome funding from 
the NDAA bill. I was shocked. 
I was shocked because I grew up in a 
country that, despite being a Repub-
lican—and I am a strong Republican; 
my mother was a strong Democrat, my 
father was a strong Republican—sup-
port for Israel, our beloved ally, our 
democratic ally, our only really, really 
reliable ally in the Middle East was 
stripped out of that bill. 
b 1245 
This was a defensive mechanism. 
This is a system, Mr. Speaker, that 
keeps missiles from coming in and kill-
ing innocent men, women, and children 
who live in fear. Never let an Israeli 
live in fear from terrorism again; a de-
fensive mechanism, a defensive system. 
So today I do applaud the Democrats 
for finally standing up and admitting 
their mistake with this bill that is un-
necessary in this format but has be-
come necessary because it was stripped 
out of the major NDAA bill. 
So I will be strongly supporting this 
bill, this billion dollars for a defensive 
system, but more importantly today 
before I reserve the balance of my 
time, let me say that as an American, 
as a Republican, as a servant in this 
House, the United States of America 
must state its unequivocal support for 
the State of Israel. 
Israel has gone through a tumultuous 
history since its founding. The United 
States has stood with Israel. We will 
stand with Israel today on this impor-
tant bill. We will fund the Iron Dome, 
and we will always protect the Israeli 
people from terrorism wherever it 
comes from.

September 23, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support 
funding for the Iron Dome. 
The Iron Dome is a purely defensive 
system, one that has saved countless 
innocent lives. Its whole purpose is to 
save lives and pursue peace. 
I strongly support Israel’s right to 
defend herself. Since its formation, 
Israel, our closest ally in the Middle 
East, has been under attack by ter-
rorist organizations like Hamas and 
Hezbollah that deny its right to exist. 
The Iron Dome is crucial to protecting 
lives against these terrorist attacks 
who continue to fire thousands of rock-
ets into Israel. 
I am proud of the work that Israel 
and the United States did together to 
develop this successful defensive sys-
tem, and I urge all my colleagues to 
support the Iron Dome Supplemental 
Appropriations Act. This should be a 
totally bipartisan effort. 
I particularly thank the members of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
and 
Chair DELAURO, DEBBIE
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, and many others for their 
work for bringing it swiftly to the 
floor. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chairwoman of the 
Appropriations Committee for yield-
ing, but more importantly, for her un-
wavering support for this important 
priority. Thank you, Ms. DELAURO, for 
your leadership in bringing this legisla-
tion to the floor to further express the 
will of Congress in a bipartisan way for 
the security of Israel. 
Iron Dome is a purely defensive sys-
tem designed to safeguard all civilians 
living in Israel. The system was co-
developed by the United States and 
Israel and has saved thousands of lives. 
Additional financial support for Iron 
Dome was part of the memorandum of 
understanding negotiated by President 
Obama in 2016. The funding being ap-
propriated today simply continues and 
strengthens this support. 
Passage of this bill reflects a great 
unity in Congress on a bipartisan and 
bicameral basis for Israel’s security. 
Assistance to Israel is vital, because 
Israel’s security is an imperative for 
America’s security. 
Today 
and 
every 
day, 
Congress 
stands in support of a comprehensive, 
durable peace in the region, and we 
pray for every life lost on all sides of 
this conflict. 
I urge a strong bipartisan vote for 
the security of the people of Israel and 
for this legislation. 
Again, I commend all who have been 
a part of putting this together, Con-
gresswoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, Con-
gressman DEUTCH, and so many others 
that I see here. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. 
NORCROSS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding, 
and I appreciate her bringing this im-
portant bill to the floor in such a time-
ly manner. 
I rise today in speaking of the impor-
tance of defending innocent lives from 
indiscriminate attacks, because that is 
exactly what Iron Dome does. It is a 
purely defensive system that safe-
guards lives and thousands of civilians 
living in Israel, many of whom have 
friends and family right in my south 
Jersey district. 
This shouldn’t be a partisan issue, 
and I hear that right before they start 
blaming the other side. My God, the 
reason why it didn’t come up before is 
because they wouldn’t vote for it. We 
couldn’t count on them. Just like we 
can’t count on them on so many issues. 
This saves lives. 300,000 of them are 
American citizens living in Israel. You 
heard the number, 4,000 shots. Very few 
people lost their lives. Still too many. 
Imagine how many would have died if 
this system were not in place. 
This is just so important for our rela-
tionship with Israel. If we fail to stand 
by our closest allies what message are 
we sending to others? 
So protecting civilian lives through 
this defensive system is a nonpartisan 
issue, and we must support it. I urge all 
my colleagues to support this measure. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Iron 
Dome 
Supplemental 
Appropriations 
Act. 
Israel has the right to defend itself 
against any assault on its sovereignty 
and its people. This funding will help 
replenish Israel’s Iron Dome to safe-
guard the Israeli people from Hamas 
rocket fire and other terrorist threats. 
It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle have decided to politicize such an 
important and serious issue even after 
the recent deadly hostilities between 
Israel and Hamas. They tried to play 
political games with something as 
deadly serious as Iron Dome by claim-
ing we should have included this in a 
different vehicle, which every single 
Republican voted against. 
Too much of a risk. 
Today’s vote is a reminder that the 
United States will always stand with 
our ally Israel, and we have always 
supported funding for Iron Dome, we 
will continue to do so. 
Enough with the politics. Israel 
wants bipartisan support. This polit-
ical gamesmanship must end. Today’s 
vote will help do that. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 5323, 
the Iron Dome Supplemental Appro-
priations Act. 
Israel is our most important, most 
reliable, and only democratic ally in 
the Middle East. The United States has 
a longstanding bipartisan commitment 
to Israel’s security, and that commit-
ment must remain ironclad. 
In May, innocent civilians in Israel, 
Jews, Christians, and Muslims were 
targeted by terrorist groups from Gaza 
who fired more than 4,500 rockets at 
schools, hospitals, and population cen-
ters. It was the Iron Dome missile de-
fense system that intercepted those 
rockets, saving thousands of lives. 
Now we must stand with our ally on 
a bipartisan basis and make sure Israel 
has the resources to defend her people 
from future terrorist attacks. We do 
that by passing this bill. 
I am grateful to Majority Leader 
HOYER and Chairwoman DELAURO for 
their leadership in bringing this sup-
plemental to the floor today. We can-
not play politics with Israel’s security 
especially when lives are at risk. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Mrs. HAYES). 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill. There are serious votes, and then 
there are messaging votes. A mes-
saging vote is designed for attack ads. 
That is exactly what we saw on the 
floor yesterday. The motion to recom-
mit, a parliamentary action, has been 
turned into a dishonest attack and 
framed as a vote against the security 
of Israel. 
I am a Democrat, and I remain firm 
in my commitment and appreciation 
for Israel’s legitimate right to self-de-
fense, and I remind everyone again 
that the motion to recommit just sends 
the bill back to committee. 
According to the memorandum of un-
derstanding between Israel and the 
United States reached in 2016, for fiscal 
years 2019 through 2028, the United 
States is expected to provide $500 mil-
lion every year for missile defense. 
That has not changed. 
Funding for the Iron Dome was never 
in jeopardy. In fact, President Biden 
has pledged to replenish the Iron Dome 
funding system, and Congress will ap-
prove it following the correct legisla-
tive action. 
A motion to recommit is a proce-
dural vote that sends a bill back to 
committee. That is all it does. My Re-
publican colleagues have shown time 
and time again that when we have to 
take actual votes, they vote against 
Israel.

September 23, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, on July 1 
the Appropriations Committee voted 
on H.R. 4373, which contains the bulk 
of Israel aid, $3.3 billion in security as-
sistance. Every Republican voted ‘‘no.’’ 
On July 13, the Appropriations Com-
mittee voted on H.R. 4432, which in-
cludes $500 million in missile defense. 
Every Republican voted ‘‘no.’’ 
So let’s be honest about what is hap-
pening here. We have consistently 
voted to support our allies in Israel. 
I end by saying, being pro-Israel and 
expressing 
concern 
for 
Palestinian 
rights are not mutually exclusive. I 
will continue to challenge myself and 
my colleagues and ask the difficult 
questions in an effort to work toward a 
solution. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, 30 
years ago in the Gulf war, Israel en-
dured 31 scud missile strikes from Iraq; 
its population effectively defenseless. 
Fifteen years ago in the second Leb-
anon war, Hezbollah fired 4,000 rockets 
at Israel in 34 days. Again, Israel had 
no active defense. 
Five months ago over the course of 
just 11 days, Hamas and other terrorist 
groups in Gaza launched more than 
4,500 rockets at Israel, but because of 
Iron Dome, Israel is no longer defense-
less. Iron Dome has saved lives both 
Israeli and Palestinian. 
America’s commitment to Iron Dome 
is rock solid. Today’s vote will make 
that clear in spite that some on both 
sides of the aisle will seek to make 
Israel and our unyielding support for 
the U.S.-Israel relationship a wedge 
issue. 
There are so many reasons for hope 
in the region. Israel has a new govern-
ment with the broadest imaginable 
governing coalition, including Arab 
parties. Israelis and Palestinians are 
talking to each other again. The Abra-
ham Accords are changing the dynamic 
between Israel and her Arab neighbors. 
Progress in all these areas starts with 
and depends on security. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 10 sec-
onds. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Progress in all 
these areas starts with and depends on 
security, and security starts with and 
relies on Iron Dome funding. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this critical funding and 
hope the Senate will take it up imme-
diately. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of critical legisla-
tion to support our key ally Israel on 
the Iron Dome technology we worked 
with them to develop. 
For 73 years, the United States and 
Israel have fostered and strengthened a 
remarkable relationship rooted in our 
shared values of freedom and democ-
racy. 
We continue to see those values at-
tacked today. 
Israel’s national security is key to 
America’s national security and to our 
fight against terror. 
Earlier this year, terrorists in Gaza 
including Hamas and the Palestinian 
Islamic jihad fired more than 4,500 
rockets at innocent civilians in Israel 
in just 11 days. 
We thank God each day for the Iron 
Dome, which intercepted 90 percent of 
the incoming rockets, saving countless 
lives. 
b 1300 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
my 
col-
leagues recently used support for this 
defense system as a political football. 
They threatened to shut down the Fed-
eral Government, putting at risk hurri-
cane disaster relief and help for Afghan 
refugees, all over support for Iron 
Dome. It was outrageous, but now we 
have a chance to act. 
Let’s pass this bill, support Iron 
Dome, and continue our historic, bipar-
tisan support for the U.S.-Israel rela-
tionship. The Senate should then im-
mediately take up this standalone 
measure and not let it get bogged down 
in the ongoing debt ceiling and con-
tinuing resolution debate. 
Mr. Speaker, we must protect our 
ally, the only democracy in the Middle 
East. Our national security is on the 
line. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to this supplemental. 
I will not support an effort to enable 
and support war crimes, human rights 
abuses, and violence. 
We cannot continue talking only 
about Israeli’s need for safety at a time 
when Palestinians are living under a 
violent apartheid system and are dying 
from what Human Rights Watch has 
said are war crimes. 
We should also be talking about the 
Palestinian need for security from 
Israeli attacks. We must be consistent 
in our commitment to human life, pe-
riod. Everyone deserves to be safe 
there. 
The bill claims to be ‘‘a replenish-
ment’’ for weapons apartheid Israel 
used in a crisis it manufactured when 
it attacked worshippers at one of the 
most holiest Islamic locations, al-Aqsa 
Mosque, committing, again, numerous 
war crimes. 
Yet, $1 billion in American taxpayer 
dollars that my colleagues want to give 
represents, to me, an absurd and un-
justifiable 140 times increase to U.S. 
funding for the Iron Dome. 
I firmly believe our country must op-
pose selling weapons to anyone any-
where without human rights law com-
pliance. 
The Israeli Government is an apart-
heid regime—not my words, the words 
of Human Rights Watch and Israel’s 
own 
human 
rights 
organization 
B’Tselem. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: 
Please stand with me in supporting 
human rights for all. 
I include in the RECORD this Human 
Rights Watch article. 
[From BBC News, Aug. 23, 2021] 
ISRAELI STRIKES ON GAZA HIGH-RISES MAY BE 
WAR CRIMES—HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH 
No-one was hurt in the attacks, but a re-
port by the campaign group says dozens of 
families were left homeless. 
The Israeli military said Palestinian mili-
tant groups were using the towers for mili-
tary purposes and turning civilians inside 
into human shields. 
But HRW said it had not provided evidence 
to support those allegations. 
At least 256 people were killed in Gaza, ac-
cording to the United Nations, and 13 people 
were killed in Israel during 11 days of fierce 
fighting. 
It began after weeks of spiralling Israeli- 
Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which 
culminated in clashes at a holy site revered 
by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas—the mili-
tant Islamist group which rules Gaza—began 
firing rockets after warning Israel to with-
draw from the site, triggering retaliatory air 
strikes. 
Between 11 and 15 May, Israeli strikes de-
stroyed the Hanadi, Jawhara, Shorouk, and 
Jala towers in Gaza City. 
In each case, the Israeli military warned 
tenants of impending attacks, allowing for 
their evacuation, according to HRW’s report. 
Israeli 
authorities 
said 
the 
buildings 
housed offices of Hamas and other Pales-
tinian militant groups, including the head-
quarters of certain units and military intel-
ligence. One tower included offices for ‘‘the 
most valuable Hamas technological equip-
ment’’ for use against Israel, it says. 
HRW’s investigation was based on inter-
views with 18 Palestinians who witnessed the 
strikes or were affected by them, along with 
analysis of videos and photographs. 
It found no evidence that members of mili-
tant groups involved in military operations 
had a current or long-term presence in any 
of the towers at the time they were at-
tacked. 
Even if there were such a presence, the re-
port says, the attacks appeared to cause 
foreseeably disproportionate harm to civil-
ian property. 
The strike on the 12-storey Jala Tower, 
which housed the offices of the Associated 
Press (AP) news agency and the Al Jazeera 
broadcasting network, provoked widespread 
outrage. 
In June, Israel’s ambassador to the US told 
AP executives that the building was being 
used by Hamas to develop an electronic jam-
ming system against the Israeli military’s 
Iron Dome missile defence system. 
But the AP’s executive editor said it had 
never had any indication that Hamas mili-
tants might be in the tower.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5112 
September 23, 2021 
‘‘The apparently unlawful Israeli strikes 
on four high-rise towers in Gaza City caused 
serious, lasting harm for countless Palestin-
ians who lived, worked, shopped, or bene-
fitted from businesses based there,’’ said 
Richard Weir, HRW’s crisis and conflict re-
searcher. ‘‘The Israeli military should pub-
licly produce the evidence that it says it re-
lied on to carry out these attacks.’’ 
In response to HRW’s report, the Israeli 
military told the BBC: ‘‘Hamas and the other 
terror organisations deliberately and unlaw-
fully embed their military assets in densely 
populated civilian areas, in order to make it 
more difficult for the Israel Defense Forces 
(IDF) to attack their military assets.’’ 
‘‘The assets Hamas tried to hide inside 
these multi-storey buildings . . . were often 
of particularly high military value, and suc-
cessfully striking them was of strategic im-
portance to the IDF,’’ it added. 
The military stressed that it provided ‘‘sig-
nificant advance warnings and took efforts 
to ensure civilians had evacuated’’ in all four 
cases. 
HRW has published two other reports on 
the conflict that accused both sides of car-
rying out attacks that apparently amount to 
war crimes. 
The first said an investigation into three 
Israeli strikes that killed 62 civilians found 
no evidence of military targets nearby, while 
the second said the firing of 4,000 unguided 
rockets and mortars towards Israeli cities 
and towns by Palestinian militants con-
stituted indiscriminate attacks on civilians. 
Both the Israeli military and Hamas denied 
the accusations. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as necessary 
to respond to this comment. 
Mr. Speaker, the truth has finally 
come out on the floor of the House of 
the United States of America. I heard 
some of my Democratic colleagues: 
Stand with me, with Israel, with our 
ally, to fight terrorism with a defen-
sive weapon system. 
And what did we just hear? We heard 
the Democratic Party speak out. We 
heard, right now, from my colleague 
across the aisle with a shocking state-
ment. She opposes this because they 
have a vocal minority in the majority 
party that is anti-Israel, that is anti- 
Semitic. And as Americans, we can 
never stand for that. 
I grew up with Holocaust survivors. I 
grew up with children of Holocaust sur-
vivors. Israel has been attacked and at-
tacked and attacked since its incep-
tion. 
As Americans, I beseech you, I reach 
out to the majority, and I say condemn 
what we just heard on the floor. Con-
demn terrorism. This is a defensive 
weapon system. Stop playing your pro-
cedural games. 
I hear recommit. It was a motion to 
recommit. You just saw something on 
this floor I thought I would never see, 
not only as a Member of this House, 
but as an American. 
Let us stand with Israel. Let’s com-
bat anti-Semitism wherever it is in the 
world, whether it is in the United 
States, whether it is from terrorism. 
I am shocked with what I just heard. 
I ask the majority to condemn the 
comments that were just made by their 
Member. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH), the chairman of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Chair DELAURO, and I thank 
the Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a speech about 
how important it is for us to stand up 
against terror and the terror strikes 
against Israel launched by the terrorist 
group Hamas from Gaza—4,500 rockets 
that Iron Dome helped to stop. And I 
have a speech that is all about how im-
portant it is for us to replenish that. 
But, Mr. Speaker, I cannot—I can-
not—allow one of my colleagues to 
stand on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives 
and 
label 
the 
Jewish 
democratic State of Israel an apartheid 
state. I reject it. 
Today, this Caucus, this body, the 
House of Representatives will over-
whelmingly stand with our ally, the 
State of Israel, in replenishing this de-
fensive system. 
If you believe in human rights, if you 
believe in saving lives, Israeli lives and 
Palestinian lives, I say to my colleague 
who just besmirched our ally, then you 
will support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, we can 
have an opportunity to debate lots of 
issues on the House floor, but to falsely 
characterize the State of Israel is con-
sistent with those—let’s be clear—it is 
consistent with those who advocate for 
the dismantling of the one Jewish state 
in the world. When there is no place on 
the map for one Jewish state, that is 
anti-Semitism, and I reject that. 
I stand in support of this important 
legislation. I thank the Speaker, the 
majority leader, and the chairwoman 
for bringing this forward, and I urge 
every one of my colleagues to stand in 
support of this. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Repub-
lican minority whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Tennessee for yielding 
and especially for his passion, the 
statements that he just made, and the 
importance of not only standing up for 
Israel, which we all need to do, but 
standing up against anti-Semitism, 
against the kind of attacks on Israel 
that the very Iron Dome are necessary 
for. 
The Iron Dome represents one of 
those great partnerships between our 
two great nations, this great bond be-
tween the United States and Israel, al-
lowing Israel to defend themselves, de-
fend themselves against attacks from 
Gaza, against attacks from terrorists 
who want to destroy Israel as a Jewish 
state. That is what this has always 
been about. 
It had been heartening for decades 
that this was always a bipartisan issue. 
We shouldn’t have to be here today to 
pass this bill because it should have 
been passed on Tuesday. There was a 
vote on the House floor to ensure Israel 
had the money to defend themselves, to 
put that billion dollars back in. On a 
straight party-line vote, every Demo-
crat voted it down. I don’t know why 
on Tuesday they were against Israel’s 
Iron Dome’s defense. Today, maybe 
things will change. Hopefully, things 
will change. But we ought to always 
stand with Israel, and especially with 
what their Iron Dome represents. 
I have been to Israel. I have been to 
areas where the Iron Dome is actually 
utilized effectively to save Jewish 
lives, to save everybody’s life who lives 
in Israel, whether it is Jews, Palestin-
ians. Anyone who lives in Israel under 
threat of terrorist attack can at least 
have some solace at knowing that the 
Iron Dome is there to protect them. 
Thousands of rockets were fired into 
Israel by terrorists, and that is why we 
need to put this billion dollars in place 
to allow them to replenish the Iron 
Dome missiles that saved lives in 
Israel. Save lives in Israel, that is what 
this is about. 
We should be with Israel, not just on 
Thursday. We should also be with them 
on Tuesday, on Monday. Every single 
day, we need to stand with our ally 
Israel against attacks that we see from 
anti-Semites around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage 
of this bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), my good friend and 
the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan 
issue. Very frankly, the CR that was 
brought to the floor the other day 
would have said we are going to pay 
the debts of the United States because 
we don’t welch, and we are going to 
fund Iron Dome. 
Unfortunately, because, to a person, 
our Republican colleagues would have 
refused and said they would not vote 
for that resolution, and because, yes, 
there were a very, very few who said 
they wouldn’t vote for it on our side, 
because all of you would not vote for 
it, and we had just a handful who would 
not vote, we could not pass it. So, the 
debt limit was at risk, and Iron Dome 
was at risk. 
The chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations, ROSA DELAURO, said that 
won’t stand. And I stood on this floor 
and said we are going to bring an indi-
vidual bill that I hope all of us will 
support. Now, obviously, all of us are 
not supporting it. There are some few 
who will not support this. But the over-
whelming majority of this Congress, 
not in a partisan way, but in an Amer-
ican way, will support defending the 
democratic State of Israel created by 
the United Nations of the world to be 
an independent, sovereign, secure na-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5113 
September 23, 2021 
Very frankly, in a bipartisan way, no 
nation on Earth has been more impor-
tant for the survival and security and 
sovereignty of that nation than the 
United States of America. Today con-
tinues that commitment. 
Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, I said we 
will deal with Iron Dome without delay 
to help defend Israel against Hamas’ 
rocket attacks. Today, I am proud to 
bring this legislation to the floor and 
thank not only Chair DELAURO but I 
also thank many who have spoken, cer-
tainly, my friend DEBBIE WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ and Mr. DEUTCH, Mr. SCHNEI-
DER, and others who have talked to me 
about this issue. 
We bring this bill to the floor with 
the expectation that it will be over-
whelmingly passed because we will put 
behind us partisanship. 
Support for Israel has traditionally 
and must always be a bipartisan issue. 
That is because we overwhelmingly 
recognize the fundamental right of the 
Jewish people to live independently in 
their ancestral homeland and to do so 
in peace and security. 
Since its founding—a millennia ago, 
in some respects—more particularly, 
politically, 1948 to today, Israel has 
been under constant threat and attack 
from those who would deny its right to 
exist—not about offensive actions that 
they took, not about this action that 
they took, to deny their very right to 
exist. 
As we continue to stand up for a two- 
state solution that achieves peace, se-
curity, hope, and opportunity for both 
Israelis and Palestinians, we vigor-
ously, strongly, unshakably, stand for 
Israel’s right to defend itself against 
terrorism. 
Make 
no 
mistake: 
Hamas 
and 
Hezbollah are terrorist organizations 
bent on murder and genocide and elimi-
nating Israel from that map of which 
Mr. DEUTCH talked. Supported by Iran, 
one of the most prolific supporters of 
terrorism in the world, and avowing 
not only the destruction of Israel but 
also harm to America, Hamas and 
Hezbollah continue to rain terror down 
on innocent Israelis. 
b 1315 
In May, Hamas showed the world, yet 
again, why these terror organizations 
remain a threat to peace to the future 
of both Israelis and Palestinians. The 
rocket attacks that launched from 
Gaza, a territory it rules with a draco-
nian iron fist, sought to kill innocent 
Israeli citizens indiscriminately. 
Sadly, Hamas’s attacks compelled a 
defensive response that led to the 
deaths 
of 
innocent 
Palestinians 
trapped in harm’s way or used as 
human shields by the terror organiza-
tion’s brutal rule. 
Mr. Speaker, much of the reason why 
so many innocent Israeli lives were 
saved was because of something we 
have done here in Congress since 2010, 
which is to fund and support and joint-
ly develop the deployment of the defen-
sive anti-rocket system called Iron 
Dome. 
Iron Dome has saved countless lives 
since 2010, including during the conflict 
in May, protecting schools, hospitals, 
synagogues, and family homes. The 
system continues to do its job, with a 
rocket from Gaza being intercepted 
less than 2 weeks ago. 
During a period of 10 days in May, 
Hamas fired more than 4,400 rockets; 10 
days, 4,400. Over 400 rockets a day fired 
into Israel, and Iron Dome extraor-
dinarily intercepted 90 percent of those 
rockets. That number, in just 10 days, 
was a dramatic escalation over the 
number of rockets fired at Israel by 
Hamas and Hezbollah over the previous 
10 years, which was around 10,000, or 
1,000 a year. 4,400 rockets in 10 days. 
Hezbollah, by the way, and we all 
recognize this, is estimated, by pub-
lished reports—I don’t have the classi-
fied reports—to have 130,000 rockets 
aimed at Israel from southern Leb-
anon. 
The number of interceptors Israel 
needs to deal with these escalating at-
tacks is going up dramatically as well. 
I talked to Mr. Lapid just 2 days ago, 
and he said to me: Congressman, I real-
ly don’t know. We know how many 
rockets they have, we just don’t know 
how many they will send at one time. 
So that we need to make sure that 
there is sufficient supply, and the re-
supply after the rockets, confronting 
the 4,400 rockets, were used. Israel 
needed 2,400 interceptors for 10,000 
rockets. In May, it needed 2,000 inter-
ceptors to take down the 4,400. 
As a result of May’s unprecedented 
barrage and the use of Iron Dome to de-
fend against it, the system needs to be 
replenished and strengthened. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to work 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support the development and 
deployment of Iron Dome as part of the 
broad, bipartisan support for Israel in 
Congress, as well as to support the 
joint American-Israeli development of 
the David’s Sling long-range missile 
system. 
Why do we do that? Why do we ask 
the taxpayers of the United States of 
America to do that? We do it because 
we believe it is in their best interest. 
Yes, it is in Israel’s interest. And, yes, 
it is in the interest of Israelis. But it is 
in the security interest of the United 
States of America. And that is why we 
proudly stand up and support this fund-
ing, and other funding that we give to 
Israel, so that it can remain the de-
mocracy that honors human rights. 
Does everybody honor human rights 
every day? America? We can look in 
the mirror. Every country can do that. 
But Israel, unlike any other country in 
the Middle East, has a supreme court 
that says to the government: You can-
not do that. 
This is the right thing to do. And 
then Israelis do it. A nation of laws. A 
nation of morals. A nation that is com-
mitted to the democratic process. 
This House will today reflect over-
whelming support in a bipartisan basis. 
Today, I believe that we will again evi-
dence our broad and bipartisan com-
mitment to Israel’s security, the safety 
of its people, and its right to self-de-
fense. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
woman Rosa DeLaura for introducing 
this legislation and our appropriators 
who worked on it, as I said, including 
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. 
Mr. Speaker, I trust that we will pass 
this today in just a few minutes. I trust 
the Senate will take it up imme-
diately, and that we will send it to the 
President of the United States. He sup-
ports this. He urges that we pass it. He 
will do the same in the Senate. This is 
the right thing to do. It is what Amer-
ica does. It stands up for countries who 
stand up for freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House on 
both sides of the aisle to overwhelm-
ingly support the passage of this legis-
lation. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to commend Chairman 
TED DEUTCH. I am grateful to be the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Middle East, North Africa, and 
Global Counterterrorism. I appreciate 
his heartfelt comments. 
I also have been to Sderot, and I have 
seen the example of the terrorist rock-
et attacks by Hamas from Gaza with 
Iranian rockets. I have seen the effect 
on mothers and families. And so this is 
something that should be addressed, 
and I appreciate Mr. HOYER bringing it 
up. That, indeed, 4,400 rockets, 400 a 
day. A reason for that is the weakness 
of the Biden-Harris government. They 
are putting the people of Israel at risk. 
And then I also believe that what we 
see with Mr. HOYER, he is being under-
cut. And I sympathize with him that 
his political party, the Democratic 
Party, has become under the influence, 
extraordinary, bizarre influence of a 
group of anti-Semites, who also hate 
the State of Israel. It is very clear, as 
we saw a few minutes ago, right here, 
how horrible this is. 
In fact, this vote is to cover the mis-
take of the Democratic Party. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I will vote in favor of the bill. 
But this is really a cover by the Demo-
cratic Party of the far left movement 
of their party abandoning the people of 
Israel. 
And so I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. But this 
is clearly just to cover a horrible mis-
take. It is worse than a mistake, a 
bowing down of extremists within the 
Democratic Party. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA).

arguably our most reliable ally in the

world; indeed, a beacon of light and a 
beacon of democracy in the Middle 
East. So I don’t understand how we 
could not work earlier this week to 
help them, to support them. 
Well, I am glad today we could come 
together on both sides of the aisle and 
come to an agreement on this with 
strong support via this resolution. I 
visited Israel several times. And when 
you visit with the people there and 
talk with them, there are people that 
live their lives under a 15-second warn-
ing for when rockets may come in at 
random from anywhere in the zones 
that are near where the rockets are 
launched from, whether it is Gaza, or 
whether it is up north in Lebanon. 
What a way to live a life. 
For us to not be able to come to an 
agreement because of politics earlier 
this week, is really sad. So I am glad 
for our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to come to an agreement today 
and get strong votes for this to support 
Iron Dome, which is a defensive mecha-
nism, technology that both us in the 
United States and Israel benefit from 
in making all of our interests stronger. 
I am glad we can have the support 
today and get it right. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers and would 
be ready to close when appropriate. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, 
today we have had yet another heated 
debate in the people’s House in the 
greatest, freest Nation in the world. 
The United States of America is a 
beacon of freedom. In my 10-year ten-
ure in Congress, I have spoken with 
world leaders in Israel, in the Middle 
East, in Europe, across the globe. The 
world looks to the United States for 
leadership and for freedom. 
Our great ally in the Middle East, 
Israel, has been threatened. Its citizens 
have been threatened since its incep-
tion, and that is wrong. 
I associate myself partially with the 
remarks of the majority leader when 
he said we need to pass this bill today; 
and we do. We need to give Israel and 
the Israeli people the capability to con-
tinue to defend themselves against 
what are terrorist attacks on its peo-
ple. 
Over 4,000 rockets directed by terror-
ists, supported by countries such as 
Iran and others, who wish to seek de-
struction of Israel. As Americans, we 
can never allow that to happen. As 
human beings, we can never allow that 
to happen. And we need to be heard, 
that beacon of freedom in the United 
States of America, all over the world in 
our defense of Israel because other 
countries have let them down. 
Today, we will not let Israel down. 
We will pass this bill. And to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who once had a great Democratic 
Party, like the great Republican Party 
in our great two-party system, stand 
up, stand up and fight anti-Semitism 
wherever its ugly head is raised. It is 
the right thing to do. 
We will do it with our vote today. 
But we heard from someone from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB); we heard from 
their radical left wing that does not 
support Israel, that does not support 
the Jewish people. It does not support 
their right, their inherent right to 
exist. 
Let us, as Americans, make our re-
solve now, today, and forever in our 
great Republic to protect the people of 
Israel. Let’s pass this bill, and let’s as-
sociate our comments, as Americans, 
with those who will always stand up 
and 
fight 
anti-Semitism, 
racism, 
sexism, and every wrong-ism that ex-
ists. That is our great America. That is 
our great Republic. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. My Re-
publican colleague’s words ring hollow. 
What are the facts? With or without 
the Iron Dome funding, every single 
House Republican refused to support 
the continuing resolution. And, I might 
add, were proud of their opposition to 
the continuing resolution. 
But this, my friends, is not the first 
time. My Republican colleagues have 
voted against USAID to Israel three 
times thus far in the 2022 appropria-
tions bills. Over and over again they 
say ‘‘no’’ to Israel. I say to them, stop 
politicizing the U.S. support of Israel. 
Stop your empty, political gimmicks, 
such as your motion to recommit yes-
terday. The democratic record is clear 
on our support for the U.S.-Israel de-
fense relationship. 
b 1330 
We are standing up for it today, we 
have stood up for it in the past, and we 
will continue to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill provides the 
necessary funds for Iron Dome to con-
tinue to protect Israeli citizens which 
furthers the goal of a lasting peace in 
the Middle East. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5323. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 420, nays 9, 
answered ‘‘present’’ 2, not voting 1, as

NEW MEXICO WELCOMES TEXAS 
WOMEN 
(Mrs. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I stand today in support of 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
New Mexico is a border State with 
Texas. Because of the draconian Texas 
abortion ban, Texas women are driving 
hours 
to 
receive 
reproductive 
healthcare in New Mexico. 
We are receiving women’s rights refu-
gees, our Texas sisters, with open 
arms, open hearts, and open clinics. 
New Mexico knows that a woman’s 
freedom to make difficult health deci-
sions belongs to her alone. In contrast,

Texas politicians deputized complete 
strangers to interfere with her health 
choices. 
Texas’ abortion ban falls most heav-
ily on minority, LGBTQ, and low-in-
come communities who can’t afford to 
travel or access quality healthcare. 
I trust in the wisdom of my House 
colleagues, who, in passing the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act, are stand-
ing with the women of this country in 
every State.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANNE 
MUELLER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Anne 
Mueller of Savannah, Georgia, who, 
sadly, passed away on September 15 at 
the age of 91. 
Anne devoted her life to serving her 
community and the State of Georgia. 
After graduating from the University 
of Georgia in 1951, Anne began an 
impactful career as a State representa-
tive, where she served for 20 years. 
Beyond her service as a State rep-
resentative, Anne was actively in-
volved in improving the Savannah 
community. 
As a board member of the Savannah- 
Chatham Humane Society and member 
of the Savannah Cultural Affairs Com-
mission, Anne touched countless lives. 
Anne’s passion for others is remark-
able, and I know her impact will never 
be forgotten. Her irreplaceable pres-
ence will be missed by all. 
I am honored to rise today to remem-
ber Anne and her lifetime of service to 
her community. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her during this most difficult time.

CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY) is recognized until 10 p.m. as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, while the 
Members of the United States Congress 
exit the Chamber, as they often do 
after whatever the majority deems ap-
propriate to have on the floor of the 
House—which there was obviously the 
important National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act—nevertheless, in my home 
State of Texas, the people of Texas are 
under siege with wide open borders. 
And so right now, as we have Mem-
bers of Congress, all 400 and something 
of my colleagues, who just left the 
Chamber, they are going off now to go 
have a steak dinner, go have a glass of 
wine, go hang out with some of their 
colleagues, meet up with some folks 
here in the District of Columbia. 
But some 1,500 or maybe more miles 
away in Texas, we have a State and a 
people who are dealing with the con-
sequences of an administration that 
fails to faithfully execute the laws of 
the United States and leaves Texas 
wide open to be harmed, endangered, 
and nobody in this body on the other 
side of the aisle seems to care in the 
slightest bit. 
I went down to south Texas a couple 
weeks ago with my friend, Senator TED 
CRUZ. We met with ranchers in Roma, 
Texas. We met with leaders and ranch-
ers and law enforcement in Uvalde, 
Texas. We met with the leaders of 
Webb County in Laredo, Texas. We 
went down to McAllen, Texas. All 
places that President Joe Biden has 
seemingly never been to in his 50 years 
of public service. Certainly hasn’t been 
there since he has been President. 
The Vice President of the United 
States, who is allegedly in charge of 
the border, hasn’t found her way to any 
of these places that I visited a mere 2 
weeks ago. 
The vast majority of my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle haven’t 
found their way. Of course, one of my 
colleagues, the gentlewoman from New 
York, a couple years ago somewhat fa-
mously found her way down to the bor-
der to decry, quote, kids in cages. 
Where is that colleague today? Wear-
ing perhaps an all-white outfit with red 
letters on it. 
Where is the concern for the little 
girls whose legs have been branded, 
burned by cartels? 
Where is the concern for the 89 dead 
migrants, bodies found in Brooks Coun-
ty, Texas? 89. Where is the concern? 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle like to go around talking 
about how compassionate they are for 
those seeking to come to the United 
States. They suggest that those of us 
who believe that the border should be 
secure don’t want Brown people in the 
United States. That is what they not 
only imply, that is basically what they 
say. 
Meanwhile, there are a hell of a lot of 
Brown people in south Texas who are 
getting pretty ticked off at an adminis-
tration that refuses to actually secure 
the border while their families are in 
danger. 
There are a whole lot of Brown peo-
ple who work for the Border Patrol 
who 
are 
feeling 
pretty 
darn 
unappreciated right now, when the 
White House press secretary lies to the 
American people. The White House 
press secretary lies on a daily basis to 
the American people. 
Lie number one, perpetuating the lie 
that Border Patrol was whipping mi-
grants. It is a lie, and it is being re-
peated by my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle. It is a lie. The Presi-
dent of the United States and those in 
charge of the press secretary are coun-
tenancing this lie about Border Patrol. 
This picture I am standing next to is 
a picture of Border Patrol with one of 
their horses, interacting with a young 
boy, who is one of the migrants from 
Haiti who is down in Del Rio. 
The young fellow is having a good 
time with this Border Patrol agent 
down on his knees. The Border Patrol 
agent is a man, probably with a family. 
I don’t know how old he is. 
But I know a lot of Border Patrol 
agents because I actually go there. I 
don’t just dismiss Border Patrol agents 
as some sort of callous individuals who 
don’t care about human beings. But 
that is what my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle do every single 
day, led by the President of the United 
States with a voice from a press sec-
retary who lies every single day about 
the state of our border, who lies every 
single day about the actions of Border 
Patrol. 
And then today, they had the audac-
ity to take away horses, at least in the 
Del Rio sector—I haven’t been able to 
look at the entire order—take away 
horses and the ability of Border Patrol 
to actually try to patrol the border. 
This coming from people who have 
never been to the dadgum border. 
There are no navigable roads along 
the river. My Democrat colleagues 
don’t care. My Democrat colleagues 
don’t care that Border Patrol can’t run 
along the river. You would think—at 
least in their politically correct non-
sense they espouse every day—that 
they wouldn’t want them to have to 
use automobiles, that maybe they 
could use horses to go down to the 
river. 
Not one of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle goes down and 
meets with the ranchers, the Border 
Patrol agents who are dealing with the 
actual outcome, the actual result of an 
administrative policy to leave our bor-
ders wide open. 
In the State of Texas, the Depart-
ment of Public Safety has caught over 
400 pounds of fentanyl this year, com-
pared to 10 pounds last year. Dead Tex-
ans. Dead Texans as a direct result of 
this administration’s refusal, flat-out 
refusal to faithfully execute the laws of 
the United States. 
A Sweet’N Low packet of fentanyl in 
pure form would kill every member of 
this body in this room. Certainly a few 
packets 
would. 
10,000 
pounds 
of 
fentanyl has been intercepted this 
year. More than the last 3 years com-
bined. 
Where 
are 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues? I asked this question when I 
was in Laredo 2 weeks ago when I was 
standing next to the Hispanic county 
judge of Webb County. A county judge 
in Texas is the chief administrator of 
the county. I asked, Where is Joe 
Biden? When he got up to the podium, 
he said, That is a great question, 
Where is Joe Biden? 
Well, if Joe Biden knows where he is, 
it would be helpful. He sure as heck is 
not down at the border. He is sure as 
heck not down in Laredo, and his poli-
cies are abandoning the people of La-
redo and abandoning the people of 
Texas.

September 23, 2021 
The policies of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle leave Texas deal-
ing with the brunt of a wide open bor-
der, and they laugh it off. They ignore 
it. 
The stash houses in Houston, Texas, 
the stash houses in Del Rio, the stash 
houses in Laredo, the stash houses in 
McAllen, the stash houses up and down 
the border where little girls and little 
boys are being put into the sex traf-
ficking trade, my Democratic col-
leagues, who love to pat themselves on 
the back for being compassionate, are 
nowhere to be found. MIA. 
Joe Biden, nowhere to be found while 
people die, while people die from opioid 
overdoses, almost 100,000 this year in 
the United States. When the cocaine 
problem was a big deal in the 1980s, we 
were talking about 10,000. Now we are 
talking about 100,000. 
Just where in the world are my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle? 
I will tell you where they are, they 
are running around preaching about 
masks and telling the people of Texas 
that small businesses in Texas must 
force-vaccinate Texans if they have got 
more than 100 employees. 
That is literally not in the Constitu-
tion, and it is fully unconstitutional, 
unlawful, and I very strongly encour-
age the people of Texas to look at the 
President of the United States and tell 
him to pound sand. Do not follow that 
order. Do not accept it as legitimate. It 
is not. 
And this is a theme that the people 
of Texas are going to have to come to 
grips with more and more, that when 
the President of the United States 
impeachably refuses to faithfully exe-
cute the laws of the United States, it is 
incumbent upon a free people in a sov-
ereign State to come up with the ways 
that they believe are important to de-
fend their borders, secure their citi-
zenry, and take action, irrespective of 
the orders of a President who fails to 
faithfully execute the laws of the 
United States. 
b 2120 
I do not make those statements 
lightly, because those statements mean 
something. But we are under assault in 
Texas, and this administration does 
not care. And worse yet, this adminis-
tration is taking specific action and 
specific inaction to purposely create 
the situation that we are having to 
deal with on the frontlines in Texas. 
Purposely reducing the enforcement 
of Title 42, which enables us to turn 
people away at the border during a 
public health emergency, pandemic en-
vironment where you can have commu-
nicable diseases like we are dealing 
with right now. Purposely not using 
the return to Mexico program, the mi-
grant protection protocols to enables 
us to work with Mexico to stem the 
tide. Where last year we had a few hun-
dred thousand people that we were ap-
prehending at the border, today this 
year we have 1.4 million; and the year 
is not over yet. We will be well over 1.5 
to 1.6 million people this fiscal year. 
Think about that. 208,000 in August. 
212,000 in July before the Haitians ar-
rived in Del Rio. 
And, by the way, if we are talking 
about the Haitians, none of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
seem to care that along the Rio Grande 
are drivers licenses from Chile, pass-
ports from Brazil, because the people 
from Haiti who came to Del Rio 
weren’t coming directly from Haiti. We 
know this. They were in South Amer-
ica. And then they got word because 
word is spreading around the globe, la-
dies and gentlemen, world is spreading 
around the globe that this administra-
tion says come to the United States, 
claim asylum, and walk right in. 
Now the problem with that is it is 
the least compassionate thing you can 
do. You endanger them on the journey. 
You endanger them through the proc-
ess so the cartels can abuse them. You 
harm the countries that they are leav-
ing from through the drain of their re-
sources, labor, brain drain, and you en-
danger the American people when you 
have a flood of migrants coming in to 
a state that then has to deal with it. 
Would any of my Democratic col-
leagues know what to do for the most 
part if I airdropped them in to south 
Texas on a 5,000-acre ranch and they 
had to walk through the scrub brush of 
south Texas running across a rattle-
snake and they go find a migrant dying 
out there from dehydration? The vast 
majority of my latte-sipping, New 
York living, condo-living colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle wouldn’t 
have a dadgum clue what to do when 
you run across that situation. But I 
can tell you my Texan constituents 
and friends in south Texas are figuring 
out what to do with human beings on 
their ranches. 
Would any of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle like to deal with 
the 89 dead bodies in Brooks county? 
Would they? Do they know what to do 
when they walk up to a body that has 
been picked apart by vultures and ani-
mals because that individual, that 
human being died on their ranch? Is 
this an uncomfortable conversation for 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle when hundreds of human beings 
are dying in the hot Texas Sun and 
county judges have to spend $3,000 per 
autopsy, $5,000 for each to then bury 
them? They are trying to figure out 
how to handle their budget when they 
have got COVID cases exploding. 
But oh, no, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, they go around 
talking about, oh, horses. Race baiting 
defines the party of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle. It is the en-
tire existence of the party of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that they would take a situation that a 
Democratic President has created pur-
posefully and then dare to turn it into 
a race-focused situation. 
I would like any of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to stand and 
look in the eyes of the 70 percent of 
Border Patrol who are Hispanic and 
tell them that they are racist. Because 
that is what they do. My colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, they go on 
TV and they say they are racist. Al 
Sharpton flies down to go have a press 
conference in Del Rio, Texas, trum-
peting out and bringing out the race 
card. MAXINE WATERS wants to com-
pare Border Patrol agents using horses 
to deal with a wide-open border and a 
chaos created by this administration to 
slavery. It is absolutely abhorrent. It is 
embarrassing. And the people of Texas 
are up to here with a Union that is not 
all that united around the principles 
upon which we were founded and that 
are showing precious little deference to 
the people of my State. They are fed 
up. There is a tinder box, and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
ignore it at the peril of the future of 
this republic. 
This is a big deal what is happening. 
The nine migrants that were in an 
automobile in Boerne, Texas, two in 
the trunk, an American citizen driving 
that car who was employed by the Car-
tel del Noreste heading to a stash 
house in Houston, a young man had 
paid $4,000 to go pick grapes in Cali-
fornia had a rude wake-up call that he 
was heading to a stash house; fortu-
nately, law enforcement intercepted 
them. 
This is happening every single day in 
our State. We know this because we go 
down and we look. Senator CRUZ and I 
go down to Laredo. We sit at a check-
point. I didn’t see any of my Demo-
cratic colleagues there. With the nota-
ble 
exception 
my 
friend, 
HENRY 
CUELLAR, who is probably the lone 
Democrat who actually acknowledges 
the crisis that we have along our 
southern border. And we watch these 
trucks go through with scanners. One 
out of 10 trucks. And then we go down 
to the river, and there are 33 migrants 
trying to come across the river. And we 
are watching them cross the river. And 
they come out, and they swim, and 
they are playing cat and mouse, know-
ing when we leave they are going to 
come across. Then we get a scan on our 
phone from one of the scans that came 
through right after we left the check-
point with a truck full of 29 migrants 
in the back. 
Every day this is happening. And 
these people are endangered. But my 
Democratic colleagues don’t care be-
cause of the crass cynicism of electoral 
politics. That is what this is about. 
The good news is the great Hispanic 
Texans 
of 
south 
Texas 
have 
had 
enough. Zapata County went Repub-
lican for the first time since 1920. When 
I drove through Zapata County just 2 
weeks ago, I stopped because I noticed 
a flag flying that had a certain colorful 
metaphor associated with the Presi-
dent that I will not, of course, repeat 
here on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. It may or may not be in 
line with a chant that has been often 
used in a number of settings around 
our country lately. In Zapata County.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5131 
September 23, 2021 
In McAllen, a Republican mayor was 
recently elected. The fact is, when peo-
ple are ignored, when people are endan-
gered, when people are taken for grant-
ed, as Hispanic Americans every single 
day, and Hispanic Texans in particular 
are experiencing every single day, they 
tend to take that seriously. 
b 2130 
They tend to recognize that an ad-
ministration that gives lip service to 
caring for them but lets them die and 
lets their businesses implode and lets 
their ranches get run over and lets nar-
cotics flow into their community at 
will, all in the false name of compas-
sion and pretending that one cares 
about somebody because of the color of 
their skin, they tend to take offense to 
that and believe that maybe there 
should be a better way. 
When I talk to people in Texas, they 
ask, quite frequently: What precisely 
are we getting out of this deal? What 
does union even mean anymore? What 
precisely is united about the United 
States? 
How can one say that we have 
‘‘united’’ States when the President of 
the United States dictates unlawfully 
to a people that they must forcefully 
vaccinate their employees. 
Then thousands of their employees 
say: Hey, I don’t want to do that be-
cause I have natural immunity, and 
science seems to show that natural im-
munity may be stronger than that that 
comes from a vaccine. 
They tend to take offense. They tend 
to want to tell the authoritarian to 
pound sand. 
When the President of the United 
States, through his HHS Secretary, 
walks in and says: Oh, I am sorry, 
Texas. I am sorry, Florida. We are 
going to cut your monoclonal antibody 
treatments in half. We are going to 
limit your ability to get care. We are 
going to try to run a campaign against 
certain medicines that might actually 
provide care for your loved ones, and 
we are going to do so out of some sort 
of fealty to bureaucrats at CDC and 
NIH and, namely, Dr. Fauci. 
The people are then relegated to the 
corner, trying to figure out how to care 
for 
themselves 
when 
a 
cronyistic 
healthcare system run by bureaucrats 
in government and bureaucrats in an 
insurance industry that is, frankly, 
corrupt, a healthcare system run by 
corporations in bed with government 
bureaucrats, getting taxpayer funds to 
enrich them and leaving small busi-
nesses and individuals in this coun-
try—Texans I represent—holding the 
bag, while the President of the United 
States limits their ability to get 
healthcare and then mandates they get 
a vaccine and then goes off to parties, 
like my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle tend to do, maskless, while 
preaching wearing masks. Because it is 
all theater. It is all a show, except that 
it is very real, and it is very focused on 
accruing power in Washington, D.C. 
My warning to my colleagues is this: 
Americans tend to take that sort of 
thing seriously. While we watch people 
in Australia, and we watch people in 
Paris, and we watch people in Canada 
even, and we watch people around the 
globe resisting the tyranny of govern-
ment, the United States is filled with 
people who similarly are predisposed to 
want to resist the power of the Federal 
Government. And they tend to take it 
very seriously. 
My warning to my colleagues is that 
if this body, the people’s House, ex-
pects for this country to be united, 
then it needs to darn well act like it 
and stop trying to force the will of a 
Federal Government against the con-
stitutional framework that we agreed 
to over the people of the State that I 
represent because the people of the 
State that I represent are not going to 
sit back and let that happen. 
This is where we are. This is the 
question of our day. Are we going to 
agree to disagree and live peaceably to-
gether? Or are we going to force ten-
sions and force conflict, which this 
Democrat-led government in the execu-
tive branch and the legislative branch 
is hellbent on doing and forcing the 
people that I represent to have to start 
asking questions about what we are 
going to do to preserve freedom for our 
children and our grandchildren to go to 
the doctor of our choice, to go to the 
school of our choice, to not have our 
children being indoctrinated with crit-
ical race theory, with dangerous prin-
ciples of race-baiting, teaching our 
kids that America is evil, restricting 
the ability of our people to be able to 
go to a doctor because they have to go 
to a bureaucrat to get permission be-
fore getting healthcare, trying to re-
strict the ability of the American peo-
ple to arm themselves while leaving 
our border wide open and defunding our 
police, and then daring to question why 
we want to be armed? 
That is how the people of Texas are 
viewing the assault on their constitu-
tional rights and the structure of gov-
ernment that was designed to protect 
liberty and to allow us to agree to dis-
agree. 
But my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle refuse, on a daily basis, to 
allow us to agree to disagree. That is a 
dangerous position by my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle. It is a 
dangerous position by this President. 
It is a dangerous position by the ad-
ministration because there is going to 
be a lot of people in at least the State 
that I represent, and I speculate a lot 
more, who are not going to sit by and 
allow a Federal Government to run 
amuck over their liberties and to tell 
them how to live their lives. 
We are not going to sit back and 
allow cartels to run over our border; to 
have drugs pour into our communities; 
to have crimes committed on our 
streets; to have migrants dying on our 
ranches, fences cut, livestock loose; 
children in the sex trafficking trade, 
while my Democrat colleagues march 
down to Del Rio and cry racism be-
cause it is the only card they can ever 
pull out of an empty deck, a deck not 
committed to the principles of power 
on which this Nation was founded or 
the flag which sits above the dais, but 
rather a dedication to a leftist, social-
ist, Marxist way of thinking and a be-
lief in the all-power of the all-knowing 
of the authority of those in govern-
ment to tell the people what to do. 
But that is not the way the American 
people view their position in a govern-
ment whose Constitution starts with 
three words: ‘‘We the people.’’ 
We have abandoned those first three 
words, ‘‘we the people,’’ and that the 
power of this government is built upon 
a foundation of the power coming from 
‘‘we the people’’ and those Bill of 
Rights that are in there to protect the 
people from the power of government. 
We are abandoning those on a daily 
basis. 
I am amazed at the extent to which 
my colleagues on this side of the aisle, 
quite frankly, are just all too often 
able to just go give a speech, go get on 
a news show, put out a press statement 
about how bad the border is, and then: 
Oh, let’s move on to the next issue. 
Let’s move on to the next topic. 
When all of these headlines about the 
Haitians in Del Rio subside, where will 
everybody be? Will my colleagues, even 
on my side of the aisle, wake up every 
day like we do dealing with this in 
Texas and understand what is hap-
pening, understand how bad a fentanyl 
epidemic is in this country? 
Do the people in this body have the 
first clue that it is our policies that are 
enabling China to use cartels to exploit 
an open border to kill Americans? And 
do they care? Not in the slightest bit. 
Then, I watch my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, frankly—today, we 
spent all day, almost 12 hours now—I 
guess 
probably 
8 
hours—offering 
amendments to the NDAA. 
b 2140 
Not one of those amendments that 
we voted on today, not one, allowed us 
to address and debate here on the floor 
of the House of Representatives the 
drafting of our daughters, the drafting 
of our mothers, the drafting of our sis-
ters, the drafting of our wives. Not one 
amendment today was allowed by Dem-
ocrat tyranny in the Rules Committee 
to allow us to have a substantive de-
bate on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives about an issue as impor-
tant as having the United States Gov-
ernment conscript women. 
Can you image that? Can you imag-
ine a body that is called the people’s 
House, having an environment in which 
we pass legislation as part of an $800 
billion defense authorization bill that 
had some 400 amendments we didn’t 
even debate on the floor of this House? 
We didn’t even debate the drafting of 
women. 
And more than half of my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle said, Oh, sure, 
why not? Why? Because they sit there 
and they say, Well, the draft will never 
occur. Well, don’t worry, if the draft

does occur, it will be because we have 
some real bad conflict with somebody 
like China. Well, which is it? You got 
to have the draft in order to deal with 
a bad conflict with China or there will 
never be a draft? 
Oh, well, okay. There will never be a 
draft, but if there is, it will be a bad 
conflict with China. But trust us. Don’t 
worry, your daughter won’t be drafted 
into combat. 
Really? Trust us? In what universe 
should I trust the Government of the 
United States? Why would I do that? 
The same government that just aban-
doned allies, abandoned Americans, 
abandoned SIVs in Afghanistan, left $85 
billion worth of equipment for the 
Taliban to exploit, allowed China to be 
able to get access to Bagram Air Base, 
and walked away from rare earth min-
erals. 
The same government that is com-
pletely ignoring their duty to enforce 
the borders, knowingly, when they 
have a mechanism to secure and en-
force our borders. The same govern-
ment, when the President’s own press 
secretary is lying on a daily basis 
through her teeth about supposedly 
horses whipping human beings. Thor-
oughly debunked. 
Is that the same government I am 
supposed to trust not to draft my 10- 
year-old daughter when she becomes 18 
and is forced by the power of govern-
ment to register for Selective Service? 
Who are we as a people? What happened 
to us? Are we such a cold, robotic peo-
ple that we can’t have an actual debate 
and discussion about the reality of life? 
Is that who we are? 
The same doctor, with a cold stare, 
who looked at my dear friend and told 
her she should abort her little boy be-
cause of a brain scan that went a little 
amok. She was coming up on the term 
in which you can do that in the Com-
monwealth of Virginia, and she chose 
life. And now her son is my godson, and 
he is a healthy little boy. The same 
coldness with which that doctor looked 
at my friend, and said, you should 
abort, in front of her two other boys 
with her husband not there. 
Is that what we have become, such a 
cold country, such a callous country, 
that we just blindly say that in the 
false name of equality or equity or 
whatever the word of choice is of the 
day, that we must draft our daughters? 
Let me be clear. Over my dead body 
will you draft my daughter. I mean 
that literally. Over my dead body will 
you draft my daughter. 
And yet that is precisely what hap-
pened 
today 
with 
no 
debates, 
no 
amendment 
allowed. 
And 
my 
col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, and 
I am particularly ashamed of my col-
leagues on this side of the aisle, for 
whispering in closed doors about, well, 
I would have voted against that if we 
would have had it on the floor. I tried 
to oppose it in committee, but, you 
know, it is the NDAA and so, you 
know, we have got to support the 
NDAA, we have got pay raises for 
troops, and never mind all the other 
garbage that is in the bill. We have got 
to support it. For 60 straight years, we 
have got to support it. 
You know why the Department of De-
fense is a complete mess? You want to 
know why the brass is completely inept 
and unable to actually run a war, un-
able to actually exit a country when a 
President gives a ridiculous order to 
exit on September 11 for optics? You 
want to know why the Department of 
Defense is completely inept? Because 
we have been authorizing it and fund-
ing it for decades. And my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle are just as 
guilty, if not more. 
And now my colleagues on this side 
of the aisle say, Sure, draft my daugh-
ters. And I say, as I have said to them, 
that a vote for this NDAA today was a 
vote to conscript our daughters. Let 
me tell each and every one of you 
across this country, that is precisely 
what it was. And do not let any Mem-
ber of this body get away with hiding 
or running from the simple fact that 
today this body voted to conscript our 
daughters. 
Imagine that one day when you are 
sitting in your house and the lottery 
number comes up for your wife and not 
for you. What are you going to do? Or 
for your daughter and not you. What 
are you going to do? 
The President of the United States 
has in multiple regards engaged in 
what I believe to be impeachable con-
duct. The President of the United 
States has failed to faithfully execute 
the laws of the United States, left our 
borders wide open, endangered our peo-
ple, endangered the people of my State. 
The President of the United States 
has failed to carry out his duty to de-
fend the United States abroad, has in 
fact aided and abetted the enemy by 
leaving billions of dollars of equipment 
for our enemies to use against us, leav-
ing Americans behind, leaving allies 
behind. 
The President of the United States 
has abused the power of his office to 
step over the bounds of the Constitu-
tion to order people—order people—to 
force their employees to get vaccinated 
when he has no such authority. He has 
no such authority, and he knows it. He 
knows it. 
For the exact same reason that the 
President of the United States admit-
ted that he didn’t have the power to ex-
tend the eviction moratorium. He flat 
out admitted it and said he was only 
going to do it until such time as the 
courts could hear the case and make a 
decision. That same President knows 
full well that his orders are unconstitu-
tional, but he does not care. And that 
is an abuse of power. 
That same President knows that the 
borders are being exploited and wide 
open and the cartels are endangering 
the American people and the migrants 
who seek to come here, but he does not 
care. And that is faithless execution of 
the laws. The President of the United 
States knows full well. 
Heck, my 12-year-old son knows full 
well, as he said as we were driving 
around, he said: Dad, why would you 
leave the equipment there for the bad 
guys to get? Well, son, maybe you 
should be an advisor to the President 
of the United States because he doesn’t 
seem to understand that concept, and 
neither does the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and neither does the 
Secretary of Defense. 
b 2150 
Because they are so focused on chief 
diversity officers, woke policies, and 
critical race theory, they don’t give a 
rat’s rear end about defending the 
United States of America. It is for that 
same reason my Democrat colleagues 
have gone down to the river and gone 
down to south Texas playing the race 
card and chanting racism and com-
paring 
Border 
Patrol 
agents 
to 
slaveholders. 
Where is the Secretary of Homeland 
Security defending the people who 
work for him and Border Patrol while 
they are outmanned, exhausted, and re-
signing because they are not being 
given what they need in support from 
the top leaders of Homeland Security? 
Secretary Mayorkas has the experi-
ence to know full well that abandoning 
title 42 and abandoning MPP, the mi-
grant protection protocols, he knows 
full well that that endangers the people 
of this country, and he does not care. 
He is leaving the people of south Texas 
exposed. He is leaving the ranchers who 
work there endangered with fences cut 
down and ranchers having to figure out 
how to protect their families and 
ranchers sending their children out 
across the ranches armed to defend 
themselves. Ranchers are finding the 
dead bodies of migrants on ranches, 
hundreds of them. 
That is faithless execution of the 
laws. That is why the Secretary of 
Homeland Security is acting with im-
peachable conduct. 
The American people are getting sick 
of this. The people of Texas are getting 
sick of this. 
My admonition to my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle is: Be very 
careful of walking this perilous journey 
of authoritarian actions by a Presi-
dent, authoritarian actions by an ad-
ministration, and authoritarian legis-
lating by a Congress that is ignoring 
our constitutional framework, ignoring 
federalism, ignoring separation of pow-
ers, ignoring their duties under the 
Constitution, and endangering the peo-
ple I represent on a daily basis because 
this will not turn out well. 
The people of Texas are not going to 
simply sit back and take it. The Gov-
ernor of Texas has been deploying De-
partment of Public Safety personnel to 
Del Rio. We have more DPS people in 
Del Rio than Border Patrol. We have 
more assets and more aerial activity; 
and but for the actions of the Governor 
of the State of Texas moving DPS 
down to Del Rio, the crisis would have 
truly exploded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

September 23, 2021 
But that is only a step. The Governor 
of the State of Texas and the $3 billion 
that the Texas legislature appropriated 
and deployed, and the DPS is down 
there working and arresting bad actors 
and arresting people for trespass, the 
State of Texas is going to have to go 
further because the Federal Govern-
ment is refusing to do its job. 
At some point the State of Texas is 
going to force a constitutional show-
down because it will be incumbent 
upon the people of Texas to do so. It 
will be incumbent upon the people of 
Texas to tell the rest of the country to 
get out of our doggone way so that we 
can defend the people of our State. 
This is where we are. 
While my colleagues decry the fact 
that Texans believe that we should pro-
tect life once it has a heartbeat, while 
my colleagues decry the fact that we 
believe we should protect life, and 
while my colleagues allow migrants to 
die, Texans want to simply keep their 
communities safe, and Texans are 
going to do so. 
The people’s House is supposed to 
mean something, Madam Speaker. The 
people’s House is supposed to be a place 
where we are able to come together and 
agree under the Constitution on how to 
have a more perfect Union. 
But Union doesn’t mean anything 
when the people of my State are being 
trampled. Union doesn’t mean any-
thing when the rights of the people I 
represent are not being respected, when 
the safety of the people that I rep-
resent is not being protected or se-
cured. And when the blessings of lib-
erty that are supposed to be secured 
under the Constitution are not being 
secured but being trampled upon, then 
it will beg questions about the efficacy 
of Union. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want 
to begin today talking about the debt 
limit by returning to three very fright-
ening statistics. 
The first is $15 trillion. That is the 
amount of household wealth that a 
leading 
economist 
recently 
warned 
could be wiped out of the economy 
should the government default on its 
debt. 
The second is 6 million. That is the 
number of jobs that the same analysis 
said could be lost should a default be-
come a reality. 
The third statistic is 9 percent. That 
is the unemployment rate our country 
potentially faces if we don’t do our jobs 
to raise the debt ceiling. 
Now, none of these statistics, none of 
these numbers need become a reality if 
both parties unite in the coming days 
to pass the continuing resolution sent 
to us by the House. It would keep the 
government open for 3 months. It 
would provide funding for disaster re-
lief and Afghan refugees. And, of 
course, it would suspend the debt ceil-
ing until the end of 2022 so we can pay 
for the debt incurred at the end of the 
previous administration. 
Every single Member of this Chamber 
is going to go on record as to whether 
they support keeping the government 
open and averting a default or support 
shutting us down and careening our 
country toward a first-ever default. 
Democrats will be united in sup-
porting the passage of the CR. It is the 
right thing to do for the American peo-
ple, and it would immediately stop 
these 
unnecessary 
crises 
that 
are 
knocking at our doorstep. 
At the end of the day, the only thing 
that matters in a legislative body is 
how you vote. That is the most impor-
tant thing we do. There are many other 
important things, but that is the one 
that matters the most. It is what our 
constituents sent us here to do. 
Now, Senate Democrats have said re-
peatedly that they are all for avoiding 
a government shutdown. They have 
said repeatedly that the debt ceiling 
must be raised. 
So I want to offer a novel suggestion: 
If Republicans want to avoid default, 
then they should vote yes. If the Re-
publicans want to keep the government 
open, they should vote yes. 
But, incredibly, Leader MCCONNELL, 
spinning a tail—a web of subterfuge, 
deception, 
and 
outright 
contradic-
tions—has said that he is going to vote 
no, and he urges Republicans to vote 
no. 
This is ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ logic. 
Republicans claim to oppose a default, 
but they are saying they are going to 
vote for one anyway. They say they op-
pose a government shutdown, but they 
are going to vote for one anyway. They 
say they want disaster relief, but they 
say they are going to oppose it when 
the time comes. 
So they can resort to all the soph-
istry they want, but if they vote no, 
the Republican Party will be solidi-
fying itself as the party of default, and 
the American people, unfortunately, 
will be the ones footing the bill—a high 
cost to pay for Republican games, po-
litical games. 
By voting to default, the Republicans 
would be telling the American people 
they are fine if people don’t get their 
Social Security checks. They are say-
ing they don’t care if our veterans are 
denied benefits. They are saying they 
don’t care if the markets come crash-
ing down, hurting people’s pensions 
and IRAs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6632 
September 23, 2021 
Now, none of this is an exaggeration. 
Economist Mark Zandi, a former ad-
viser to the late Senator McCain, wrote 
recently that a default would be ‘‘a 
catastrophic blow to the nascent eco-
nomic recovery from the COVID–19 
pandemic.’’ 
He also warned that ‘‘Americans 
would pay for this default for genera-
tions.’’ I hope my Republican col-
leagues heard the last part, as they are 
thinking of indulging in the political 
game put forward by Leader MCCON-
NELL. ‘‘Americans would pay for this 
default for generations.’’ 
Of course, we all know by now that 
the Republican justifications for oppos-
ing raising the debt ceiling are entirely 
bunk. They say they are opposed to 
new spending, but the Wall Street 
Journal has said: ‘‘Raising the debt 
limit wouldn’t facilitate future spend-
ing, and Congress would still need to 
raise the debt limit this fall even if no 
new major spending programs are en-
acted.’’ 
Do you hear that, Republicans? This 
is the Wall Street Journal. Even if not 
a single new spending program were en-
acted, we would still have to raise the 
debt that was incurred by President 
Trump and by all of your votes. 
How crass can you be? How heartless 
can you be? You voted to spend these 
moneys because of COVID—it was a 
valid reason—and now you don’t want 
to pay for it, and you come up with 
some lame political sophistry, trying 
to justify it. But everyone sees through 
that—everyone. 
The truth is, we will be voting to pay 
for the debt accrued under Presidents 
of both parties, including the $8 trillion 
added to the debt under President 
Trump. Both sides incurred the debt; 
both sides should pay. 
It wasn’t long ago that threatening a 
default on national debt was something 
you only heard in the fringes of the Re-
publican Party. About 10 years ago, the 
Republican Speaker at the time called 
the idea ‘‘insanity.’’ 
But today, it is literally the party 
line—a sad commentary on just how 
far down the rabbit hole the Repub-
lican Party has gone. 
If my Republican colleagues disagree, 
they have a simple option: They can 
vote yes to keep the government open. 
They can vote yes on suspending the 
debt limit. It is in their hands. 
But if Republican votes favor a shut-
down and default, the American people 
will see exactly who is responsible for 
throwing our country into crisis. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on nominations. Now, 
on the activity happening on the floor 
today, thanks to the political stunts 
and a handful of obstructionist Repub-
licans, the Senate is going to spend a 
lot of extra time today on something 
that is generally a routine process: 
confirming uncontroversial but critical 
nominees to the Department of State 
and other important Agencies. 
Of all the mandates of the govern-
ment, there is one that holds impor-
tance above all others: keeping the 
American people safe from all threats, 
foreign and domestic. 
To fulfill this responsibility, the 
President relies on a vast army of dedi-
cated public servants across the gov-
ernment. They are the expert dip-
lomats, Under Secretaries, and Assist-
ant Secretaries whom we rarely hear of 
in the news, but they play an indispen-
sable role in keeping America safe. Of-
tentimes they are quiet heroes. 
But, today, an alarming number of 
posts essential for our national secu-
rity remain vacant because a handful 
of Republicans have decided to hijack 
the confirmation process and put a 
hold on not just a few but on many 
critical nominees. 
As a result, today, we are going to 
have to take the long way to move for-
ward with seven of the nominees cur-
rently on hold. We need to get these 
confirmed as soon as possible. And if 
the irrational stonewalling by Repub-
licans of these noncontroversial nomi-
nees continues, we may need to take 
this tedious exercise again in a greater 
magnitude. 
The Republicans responsible for hold-
ing up these confirmations are delib-
erately making the American people 
less safe in a vain and futile effort to 
enhance their own political fortunes. 
Every single one of these nominees was 
reported out of committee with bipar-
tisan support. There is no rational 
basis for their delay. The fleeting gain 
these Republicans receive will pale in 
comparison to the damage they are 
causing to our country. 
It is not just an issue of a few nomi-
nees here and there. This is scores of 
diplomats and other public servants 
who are unable to get to work because 
a few Members of this body are holding 
everything up. It is intentional sabo-
tage of this Chamber’s operation, and 
it is going to hurt our government’s 
ability to respond to crises around the 
world. 
Imagine if you dial 911, but nobody 
has been hired to pick up the phone on 
the other side. That is more or less 
what these Republicans are doing to 
many of our diplomats, who are often 
the first line of defense when an inter-
national crisis breaks out. 
Of course, this Chamber, under this 
leadership, is not going to tolerate a 
few Members who want to muck up the 
confirmation process to make a scene. 
It will just take a little longer to get 
them 
done—maybe 
nights, 
maybe 
weekends. 
We will focus today on pushing these 
nominees through for the sake of our 
national security. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PETERS). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, Re-
publicans are shining a spotlight on 
the reckless taxing-and-spending spree 
that Washington Democrats are writ-
ing behind closed doors. The radical 
left is pushing in all their chips. They 
want to use this terrible but temporary 
pandemic as a Trojan horse for perma-
nent socialism. And President Biden, 
who ran as a unifying moderate, is ei-
ther powerless to stop them or does not 
wish to. 
An 
avalanche—an 
avalanche—of 
crushing tax hikes that would hurt 
families and would help China; a gov-
ernment power grab over more of 
Americans’ 
healthcare 
decisions, 
childcare choices, family finances, and 
daily lives; trillions upon trillions 
more in government spending when 
families are already facing inflation— 
none of this, of course, will get a single 
Republican vote in either Chamber. 
Democrats have not even consulted 
us. They haven’t tried to earn our 
votes. From the start, they have 
planned to use a party-line, fast-track 
process to ram through the Senate this 
version of their vision of America. 
That is why Republicans will not 
help this unified Democratic govern-
ment with its basic duty to raise the 
debt ceiling. This could not be simpler. 
If they want to tax, borrow, and spend 
historic sums of money without our 
input, they will have to raise the debt 
limit without our help. 
This is the reality. I have been say-
ing this very clearly since July, and I 
think our Democratic colleagues are fi-
nally getting it because now they are 
fumbling for bogus excuses. They re-
main confident they can spend trillions 
of dollars to remake the entire econ-
omy in a couple of weeks, but, sup-
posedly, they just cannot clear this 
much smaller procedural hurdle with-
out Republican help. Really? Give me a 
break. 
Earlier this year, Senate Democrats 
specifically 
requested 
and 
received 
extra flexibility around the reconcili-
ation process. They have every proce-
dural tool they need to promptly ad-
vance a separate stand-alone piece of 
legislation addressing the debt limit 
without a single Republican vote. Our 
colleagues have plenty of time to get 
this done. It is laughable—laughable— 
to hear some Democrats claiming they 
simply don’t have enough time. 
Last month, Democrats introduced a 
sweeping budget resolution on August 9 
and passed it before sunrise on August 
11—3 days. Our Democratic colleagues 
have about a month—a month—plenty 
of time to do their job as a unified gov-
ernment and protect the full faith and 
credit of the United States. 
The Democratic chairman of the 
House Budget Committee admitted last 
weekend 
that 
Democrats 
could— 
could—tackle the debt limit alone, but 
they just don’t want to. Some Senate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6633 
September 23, 2021 
Democrats have said similar things. 
This may be inconvenient for them, 
but it is totally possible. And this 
Democratic government must not man-
ufacture an avoidable crisis for the 
sake of their own convenience. 
Senate Democrats know what they 
need to do. Let me lay it out. They will 
need to write a short resolution amend-
ing their previous budget resolution 
with new debt limit instructions. You 
have to take that to the Budget Com-
mittee, which will probably deadlock, 
so they will vote to discharge it like 
they have done for other bills and 
nominations. 
Then a vote to proceed on the floor, 
a limited vote-a-rama, and a vote on 
final passage. And then, once the budg-
et has been amended, House and Senate 
Democrats will use the same fast-track 
process on a short and simple bill to 
actually raise the debt limit. 
This won’t be a multiweek process. It 
is probably about a week of the Sen-
ate’s time or a little more. And they 
won’t have to wait on their reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree either. They 
can move a stand-alone debt limit bill 
all on its own. 
I understand our Democratic col-
leagues may feel inconvenienced by 
this. I understand this may slightly 
delay their partisan bill, but that is a 
complaint. That is a complaint, not an 
excuse. 
We have a unified Democratic gov-
ernment that has decided to govern 
alone. They cannot put partisan ambi-
tions ahead of basic duties. The party- 
line authors of this reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree will be the party- 
line owners of raising the debt limit. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. President, now, on a completely 
different matter, the free world faces 
many serious threats from rising au-
thoritarians to resurgent terrorists. 
Even declining authoritarian powers 
like Russia pose significant challenges. 
These threats demand clear-eyed lead-
ership of the world’s greatest power. 
But earlier this week, at the United 
Nations, President Biden didn’t offer a 
rallying cry for the world to confront 
those threats. Instead, he tried to turn 
the page, literally. He bragged that ‘‘I 
stand here today for the first time in 20 
years with the United States not at 
war. We have turned the page.’’ He fur-
ther claimed that ‘‘we have ended 20 
years of conflict in Afghanistan.’’ 
Well, that is actually news to the Af-
ghans. For them, the conflict continues 
and, for the terrorists as well, con-
tinues for them too. We may be turning 
the page, but they are not turning a 
new leaf. The Taliban-Haqqani govern-
ment in Kabul is just getting started. 
Al-Qaida and ISIS-K are not standing 
down in their fight against the West; 
neither are Iran’s murdering proxy 
forces all across the Middle East. 
Theocratic killers will not simply 
disarm themselves because our Presi-
dent offered scripted platitudes to 
United Nations diplomats. To the ex-
tent they care about international 
norms, it is because they seek to de-
stroy them. They will not be deterred 
by what our President calls ‘‘relentless 
diplomacy.’’ 
Strangely, but fortunately, President 
Biden’s rhetoric does not even match 
the actions his own administration is 
taking. Indeed, the day before his 
speech, the United States targeted an 
al-Qaida operative in a drone strike in 
Syria. 
The 
President 
pretends 
we 
aren’t at war with terrorism, but nei-
ther his own team nor the terrorists 
believe that. Our unilateral retreat 
from Afghanistan did not magically 
usher in a truce with terrorists; it just 
left us much less able to monitor and 
combat them. 
The consequence of President Biden’s 
slogan-driven policy is not that Amer-
ica’s war is over; it is that America 
now has to fight with one hand tied be-
hind our back. 
Back in April, the President’s own 
CIA Director warned this body—us— 
that, after retreating, our ‘‘ability to 
collect and act on threats will dimin-
ish. . . . That is simply a fact,’’ he said. 
In June, the Secretary of Defense 
told us that al-Qaida could reestablish 
a safe haven and directly threaten our 
homeland within 2 years. This is back 
when the administration still assumed 
we would have responsible partners in 
charge in Afghanistan. 
Even then, the Secretary said that 
al-Qaida would reestablish a safe haven 
and threaten our homeland within 2 
years. Certainly that timeline has now 
moved significantly up. So the ques-
tion is, Where do we go from here? 
What is next? 
The first step is to get some answers 
and create some accountability. As I 
have said before, the administration 
must answer some tough questions 
about both past failures and future 
plans. 
Secretary Austin needs to explain 
why he supported a policy that by his 
own admission would allow al-Qaida to 
reestablish a safe haven. And we need 
an updated assessment of the threat we 
face now that terrorists, rather than 
our partners, control Afghanistan. 
Oh, but that is just a start. America 
must reestablish the credible, relent-
less threat we once posed to terrorists 
in 
Afghanistan 
and 
beyond. 
The 
Taliban’s 
shameful 
reclamation 
of 
Kabul has emboldened America’s en-
emies all around the world. We cannot 
let them bank a propaganda victory. 
We must recapture the initiative. We 
can’t retake the initiative with empty 
talk. This will take arrests, and it will 
take strikes—visible demonstrations of 
our resolve. 
We must also repair our credibility 
with our allies and partners. America’s 
resolve to lead the War on Terror fight 
must be undoubted. This is a collective 
effort that will take support and con-
tributions from partners all around the 
world, 
deeper 
intelligence 
sharing, 
joint efforts to prevent extremists from 
traveling to safe havens in the first 
place, and a willingness to repatriate 
and prosecute their citizens when they 
go abroad to conduct terrorism. 
We have to get past the radical left’s 
passion for cutting our defense budget 
down to the bone. President Biden al-
ready proposed to cut defense spending 
after inflation. I understand some 
House Democrats want to impose even 
further cuts from that number. 
Just this week, to appease a vocal 
fringe on the far left, House Demo-
cratic leadership left defensive assist-
ance for our ally Israel and their Iron 
Dome on the cutting room floor. A few 
far-left radicals get veto power over 
purely defensive assistance for Israel? 
This is madness. So are the left’s ef-
forts to cut back the authorities that 
our military and intelligence profes-
sionals use to protect our homeland. So 
is the continued talk about emptying 
Guantanamo Bay, talk about that. For 
goodness’ sake, we just saw four of the 
five terrorists whom President Obama 
sprung from Gitmo take up senior posi-
tions in the Taliban government—for-
mally in Gitmo; now helping to run the 
government in Afghanistan. What a 
combined legacy. The Obama-Biden ad-
ministration let those terrorists out of 
prison, and the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration let them retake an entire coun-
try. 
No, global wars do not simply end be-
cause a President’s speechwriter says 
so. Wars end when America’s enemies 
no longer threaten us. Unfortunately, 
the Biden administration’s decisions to 
date have not brought that victory any 
closer.

CANADIAN BORDER 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, early 
this week, the administration extended 
its border closure with Canada for an-
other month. Another month that vac-
cinated Americans can travel into Can-
ada, but vaccinated Canadians cannot 
cross 
our 
border; 
dealing 
another 
monthlong blow to American busi-
nesses all across our northern border. 
Now, I am glad to see the Biden ad-
ministration taking the pandemic seri-
ously and delivering much-needed re-
lief in a lot of different ways, but I am 
not going to stay quiet about this seri-
ous, completely unnecessary harm this 
border-crossing closure is causing to 
small businesses and workers in Point 
Roberts, WA. 
Now, as I have said to everybody who 
will listen, and some who, I am sure, 
are tired of hearing me, Point Roberts 
must at least have an exemption as we 
work to safely reopen the U.S.-Cana-
dian border. 
And here is why. For those of you not 
familiar with this particular part of 
Washington State, Point Roberts is 
right here. It is called an exclave com-
munity. People who live in Point Rob-
erts, in order to get to the rest of our 
State, have to travel through Canada 
and back down to Washington State. If 
Canadians cannot come across the bor-
der, Point Roberts is really isolated. 
That is what is happening right now. 
Now, let’s paint a picture. You can 
take a boat right now from Canada to 
Point Roberts. You can fly across the 
border from Vancouver down to Se-
attle. But right now, because this bor-
der is closed, a Canadian family who 
lives within here can’t go to Point Rob-
erts for lunch, and they are sitting 
right here. This is this Canadian bor-
der, and this is Point Roberts. 
Now, Point Roberts has some small 
businesses, and its entire economy can-
not survive without that easy border 
cross for folks who live within this re-
gion. They can’t count on people from 
down here to come up to their res-
taurants or to their businesses. 
Their local economy depends on Ca-
nadian tourists, especially since, by 
the way, the only ferry between Point 
Roberts and the rest of Washington 
State is closed because of the pan-
demic. So people can’t get up there 
right now. The only people who can 
help that community survive have to 
come across this border, and they can’t 
because it is closed. 
Now, this has been going on for 17 
months and counting, and I have heard 
from so many small business owners 
there, including the owner of the only 
grocery store in town who is now on 
the brink of shutting down his doors 
for good—the only grocery store here 
for the people who live there and for 
the people close by. 
Now, I really appreciate the adminis-
tration’s science-based approach to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. We have to follow 
science, and we need to follow the evi-
dence, and I am proud we have taken 
COVID–19 extremely serious from the 
very start in my home State of Wash-
ington. But I firmly believe the evi-
dence supports at least a narrow and 
tailored exception to the Canadian bor-
der closure to allow for a reopening 
right here for this community, Point 
Roberts. It is their port of entry for Ca-
nadian travel, and it needs to be open 
if we want those people to survive. 
I have yet to be presented with a 
compelling reason why a border exemp-
tion for this small little community 
has not yet been provided. 
I have spoken directly with DHS Sec-
retary Mayorkas about this. I have 
talked with Jeff Zients, the White

House Coronavirus Response Coordi-
nator, and a lot of other top officials at 
the State Department and White House 
as well. No one—not a person—can ex-
plain to me what evidence is being used 
to support that border restriction right 
there for Point Roberts. 
So I am here on the Senate floor 
today to make sure that President 
Biden and his administration under-
stand me. At the very least, we just 
need an emergency exemption from 
these restrictions for this small little 
Point Roberts community right here so 
that they can get their economy back 
up and running and that people there 
have the services that they need. 
I am going to continue to press the 
administration on this and do whatever 
I can to help this community. But I 
want this on the record: Maintaining 
this ban on cross-border travel for 
Point Roberts is absolutely unaccept-
able. It should have been addressed 
months ago, and I will not stop until 
this is resolved. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here to talk today about a subject of 
urgency for our Nation but a subject 
that many Democrats in this body 
don’t want to talk about. I mean Af-
ghanistan. 
Thirteen American soldiers, dead; 169 
civilians, dead; hundreds more Amer-
ican civilians left behind to the enemy; 
billions of dollars in military equip-
ment abandoned to the enemy, like you 
see in the images right over my shoul-
der. Yet, nearly a month after this dis-
astrous evacuation, the worst foreign 
policy disaster in this Nation’s history 
since Vietnam, there has been no ac-
countability. No one has been fired. No 
one has resigned. No one has been re-
lieved of command. 
Instead, what we have heard is the 
most incredible and, frankly, insulting 
parade of excuses and evasions from 
the President of the United States and 
the rest of his leadership team. They 
have said the evacuation debacle was 
an ‘‘extraordinary success.’’ That is a 
quote. That is from the mouth of the 
President himself. Let that just sink in 
for a second. 
Thirteen American soldiers, includ-
ing from my State of Missouri, lost— 
13—169 civilians dead; hundreds of 
Americans left behind enemy lines to 
fend 
for 
themselves, 
left 
to 
the 
Taliban, left to ISIS. Has an American 
President 
ever—ever—left 
behind 
American civilians on the field of bat-
tle—hundreds of them—and then called 
it an extraordinary success? I can’t 
think of a time in American history. 
It was a disgrace, what the President 
said. It was untrue, what the President 
said. Yet he goes on and on and on. And 
now President Biden and his team say 
they didn’t leave any Americans be-
hind. They said, in fact, Americans 
weren’t abandoned to the enemy. 
I mean, this is simply insultingly 
false. By their own estimates, hundreds 
of American civilians were left behind 
and are still there. Americans are still 
trapped in Afghanistan, trying to get 
out, trying to be rescued, left to their 
own devices. Yet the President of the 
United States insists that it never hap-
pened; it was all a success; all is well. 
The President said it had to be this 
way. Those soldiers—what?—had to 
die? I mean, what does that even 
mean—that the military had to aban-
don billions of dollars of equipment to 
the enemy; that civilians, hundreds of 
them, had to die; all those Americans 
had to be left behind? I mean, is he se-
rious about that? Does anyone honestly 
believe that? Does anyone honestly be-
lieve that this was the only possible 
outcome, that the death of American 
soldiers and the loss of civilians was 
the only possible outcome, the only 
way to withdraw? 
It is absurd, and an honest leader 
would acknowledge it. In fact, an hon-
est leader would never have said it. Yet 
President Biden and his team continue 
to say it day after day. 
Joe Biden has blamed other people. 
He has pointed the finger at the people 
of Afghanistan. That is remarkable. 
These people now suffering under the 
rule of the Taliban—they are at fault, 
apparently. He has blamed and his ad-
ministration has blamed the intel-
ligence Agencies. They cast aspersions 
at the commanders on the ground. And 
remarkably—remarkably—many 
Democrats in Congress seem to be fine 
to go along with all of this, with these 
excuses and these evasions, this at-
tempt to whitewash what has happened 
in Afghanistan and is happening as we 
speak, as Americans remain behind 
enemy lines. 
The Democrat leader has stood on 
this floor and praised Joe Biden’s han-
dling of this crisis, applauded it. Just 
yesterday, he said right here on the 
floor that my efforts to get account-
ability for this crisis in Afghanistan 
were a waste of the Senate’s time. 
Those were his words: waste of the Sen-
ate’s time. He also said it is something 
that only the far right is interested in. 
His words: ‘‘the far right.’’ What an in-
sult to the American people. 
All I can say to that is: Why don’t 
you come to Missouri? Why don’t you 
talk to the families of soldiers who are 
serving? Why don’t you talk to the 
families of those who have served in 
this 20-year war? Why don’t you talk to 
veterans? Why don’t you look the peo-
ple in the face who are grieving and 
who are demoralized and who are 
shocked at what happened over the last 
few months in Afghanistan, shocked at 
the abandonment of American civil-
ians? For that matter, why don’t you 
just talk to this administration’s own 
officials who rushed to tell reporters, 
off the record, that they were horrified 
that the President had left behind 
American civilians—horrified. 
To brush all of that aside, to pretend 
that none of that really matters—that 
is all a distraction; there is nothing to 
see here—that is insulting, and it is 
wrong. 
Until there is accountability, I will 
force the Senate to actually vote on 
Joe Biden’s nominees for leadership po-
sitions in the State Department and 
the Department of Defense. In the face 
of this crisis, in the face of this deba-
cle, the least the Senate can do is vote. 
But the Senate ought to be doing a 
lot more than that. While grieving 
families are still waiting for answers, 
while Americans are still left behind 
enemy lines, we should be getting the 
truth. That ought to be our focus. We 
should be demanding accountability, 
not sweeping it under the rug. 
So let me just pose a few—a few—of 
the questions that I think need answer-
ing: Why was the administration so un-
prepared for what transpired during its 
evacuation? Why didn’t it plan for the 
potential fall of Kabul, for the poten-
tial surge of the Taliban, for the poten-
tial collapse of the Afghan Security 
Forces? Why weren’t they prepared to 
withdraw while keeping Americans 
safe? 
Joe Biden and his team didn’t coordi-
nate the drawdown so American citi-
zens could leave the country; they ig-
nored them. They told us the Afghan 
Security Forces were 300,000 strong; 
they were never that large. They prom-
ised the security forces were well 
trained; they weren’t. 
Has no one bothered to read the re-
ports of the inspector general for Af-
ghanistan? I commend them to you. 
They are harrowing. It is harrowing 
reading. The inspector general has been 
warning for literally years that the Af-
ghan Security Forces were unprepared 
and unreliable. He has warned that our 
own 
Defense 
Department 
has, 
for 
years, concealed the true state of the 
Afghan Security Forces and their in-
ability to carry out their mission. 
These aren’t secrets. These are reports, 
many of them published in the Nation’s 
leading newspapers. 
Yet the administration didn’t factor 
them into their planning, didn’t seem 
aware of the facts on the ground, didn’t 
seem able to prepare to deal with the 
realities, even as Americans were put 
into harm’s way. It really does make 
you wonder: What was the Biden ad-
ministration actually focused on? I 
mean, what was it doing with its time? 
What was the President doing with his

time for all of those months—or Sec-
retary Blinken or Secretary Austin or 
the National Security Advisor? What 
were they doing while Afghanistan col-
lapsed into chaos? 
I think the facts suggest an answer. 
Rather than focusing on protecting 
Americans from the enemy, rather 
than focusing on getting Americans 
safely out of Afghanistan, they were fo-
cused on fighting a phony culture war 
that they invented and that appears to 
be their top priority. 
Just consider: On June 11, when Sec-
retary Austin was asked if he thought 
that the U.S. military was a fundamen-
tally racist organization—this was at a 
hearing in the Armed Services Com-
mittee here in the Senate: Is the U.S. 
military a fundamentally racist orga-
nization?—he said: I can’t give you an 
answer. And, instead, he talked about 
the military’s urgent support for ‘‘eq-
uity’’—his words. One week later, 21 
districts in 9 Provinces had fallen 
under Taliban control in Afghanistan, 
and the Afghan Security Forces began 
to abandon their posts. 
On June 21, Secretary Blinken an-
nounced the ‘‘Progress flag’’ would fly 
at the State Department, a special flag 
that celebrates, in Blinken’s words, 
‘‘diversity and intersectionality’’—that 
famous catchphrase of critical race 
theory. The very next day, the Taliban 
seized the main Afghan trade gateway 
as the enemy’s advance began to pick 
up pace. 
On June 23, General Milley said in his 
testimony to the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee: ‘‘I want to understand 
white rage.’’ That is his quote. And he 
defended the administration’s recent 
focus on White extremism in the mili-
tary. The very next day, U.S. intel-
ligence assessed that the Afghan Gov-
ernment 
would 
collapse 
within 
6 
months of our withdrawal. 
On July 1, Secretary Blinken was 
busy changing U.S. passports to create 
new selections for nonbinary, intersex, 
and gender-nonconforming categories. 
The very next day, American troops 
withdrew from Bagram Air Base, what 
had been the hub of American power in 
Afghanistan, leaving it for the final 
time. 
On July 14, Secretary Blinken invited 
the United Nations to formally inves-
tigate ‘‘the scourge of racism, racial 
discrimination, and xenophobia’’ in the 
United States. He invited the United 
Nations, that frequently corrupt body, 
to investigate his own country for rac-
ism, xenophobia, and racial discrimina-
tion. Meanwhile, at the very same 
time, even as Blinken spoke, the 
Taliban offensive was surging across 
Afghanistan. 
On August 9, Secretary Austin was 
busy crafting a new, controversial 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate for all of 
our servicemembers. The very next 
day, U.S. intelligence officials warned 
that the Afghan Government would 
collapse within 90 days or sooner. 
On August 17, Jake Sullivan—that is 
the National Security Advisor—said 
that the Taliban were helping to pro-
vide ‘‘safe passage’’ for Americans flee-
ing Afghanistan. Well, one week later, 
the terrorist attack at Kabul left 13 
American soldiers dead, at least 169 ci-
vilians wounded, and, shortly there-
after, hundreds of Americans left be-
hind as our last transport lifted off. 
Facts are facts. These are the facts, 
and they tell the story. Joe Biden and 
his team were more focused on their 
culture war than they were on pro-
tecting Americans. That is the long 
and the short of it. They were more in-
terested in imposing a radical left so-
cial agenda than in getting Americans 
out of Afghanistan. 
They were interested in using the 
military as a social experiment rather 
than respecting it as the warfighting 
institution it was built to be. Rather 
than making decisions that were sound 
in tactics and sound in strategy, Joe 
Biden and his team were aiming to 
please their radical, woke, progressive 
base. And the American people paid the 
price. 
Now the American people deserve ac-
countability for what has happened. 
They deserve accountability for the 
lives lost. They deserve accountability 
for the civilians killed, accountability 
for the Americans left behind. 
And that is what this body is for. 
That is this body’s responsibility. It 
may be an inconvenience to the Demo-
crat leader; it may be an unwanted re-
sponsibility for supporters of the Presi-
dent; but it is our job nonetheless. 
Americans 
have 
died. 
Americans 
have been abandoned. The Nation de-
serves an accounting, and it is not too 
much to ask the Senate to do its job. It 
is not too much to ask the Senate to 
get the truth, and it is not too much to 
ask the Senate to force accountability 
for this terrible crisis that this Presi-
dent has disgracefully led us into. 
I can say, for my part, I will do ev-
erything I can to get that account-
ability, to get that truth, and to give 
the American people the answers that 
they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
NORTH KOREA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with 
North Korea test firing ballistic mis-
siles last week, you might ask: Where 
is the United Nations? 
There are a series of international 
sanctions aimed at North Korea’s nu-
clear program. These sanctions are in 
accordance with the U.N. Security 
Council’s regulations passed in the 
wake of previous North Korea nuclear 
tests and ballistic missile tests. There 
is a U.N. Security Council Sanctions 
Committee on North Korea that is 
charged with monitoring these sanc-
tions on North Korea. 
The Wall Street Journal has reported 
that an expert panel working on a re-
port for this U.N. committee has faced 
roadblocks from Chinese representa-
tives, supported by Russia in some cir-
cumstances. 
China and Russia supported these 
sanctions, but now they appear to be 
running interference for North Korea 
so North Korea can continue to violate 
the reason these sanctions were put on. 
The expert panel is supposed to re-
port the facts. And then by reporting 
the facts, they aren’t representing na-
tional governments and shouldn’t be 
representing national governments. 
It is blatantly clear that the Chinese 
representative is doing the bidding for 
the Chinese Communist Party. The 
footnotes with dissenting comments 
are anonymous, but there is no doubt 
where they came from. In other words, 
China. 
In one case, it is as petty as insisting 
that a reference to a company with 
‘‘Taiwan’’ in its name should include 
an assertion that Taiwan is a province 
of China. That is something you hear 
from China all the time. Everyone 
knows China is obsessed with making 
others pretend that Taiwan is not an 
independent country. 
That leaves no doubt where these ob-
jections are coming from. You can 
draw a very straight line back to Gen-
eral Secretary Xi. The bigger problem 
is that other objections seem designed 
to minimize and paper over the viola-
tions of these sanctions by North 
Korea. That is as good as confirmed by 
suspicions that China has been helping 
North Korea evade the sanctions that 
China supported in the first place and 
still claims to support. 
General Secretary Xi probably thinks 
that letting North Korea run wild with 
its nuclear weapons program would 
cause problems for the West. And we 
all know that the West is very con-
cerned about North Korea’s developing 
of nuclear weapons and the ability to 
deliver. 
General Secretary Xi is very short-
sighted when he takes that view that 
he wants to cause problems for the 
West by helping North Korea, because 
it can’t be in China’s interest to have a 
nuclear-armed and unstable regime as 
a next-door neighbor, which North 
Korea is a nuclear-armed and a non-
stable regime. 
General Secretary Xi’s strategy of 
sowing chaos is playing with fire. That 
is why all of this activity going on in 
the U.N. and China trying to cover up 
the violations of the sanctions is dan-
gerous not just for the U.S. interests, 
but it is very dangerous for China and 
the world. 
I yield the floor.

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I spent 
those several weeks that we were away 
from Washington, DC, around Labor 
Day in Kansas, and, unfortunately, it is 
clearly evident that inflation has re-
turned. Gas prices are up, prices at the 
grocery store are up, and further price 
hikes are on the horizon. 
Unfortunately, price increases at the 
grocery store and at the gas pump and, 
really, everyplace else put the greatest

burden on low- and middle-income fam-
ilies who are already feeling the strains 
caused by COVID–19 in their pocket-
book. 
It is apparent, I think, that our 
spending here in the Nation’s Capital 
over a long period of time is part of the 
cause for that inflation and, in fact, a 
significant part of the cause for that 
inflation. But it doesn’t seem to me 
that my Democratic colleagues are 
aware of the consequences of pouring a 
massive amount of more money, more 
government spending on already this 
inflationary 
circumstance 
that 
our 
citizens are now encountering. 
The Democratic tax-and-spend spree 
will exacerbate our inflationary cir-
cumstances, meaning that the prices 
will continue to rise as we borrow more 
money to pay for these things. It 
means that interest rates will rise and, 
at some point in time, those who lend 
us money will no longer be willing to 
do so. 
While I am sure that many of my 
Democratic colleagues would tell me 
the good things that would happen 
from the spending that is included in 
this bill, we cannot discount the people 
who they indicate they are trying to 
help would be the ones who suffer the 
greatest burden from increasing costs 
of everything that they buy. 
Given the historic levels of spending 
that has occurred over the last year 
and a half, now is not the time to spend 
even greater amounts of taxpayer dol-
lars. 
My view is that we were too slow in 
turning the spigot in regard to spend-
ing that preceded the election of Presi-
dent Biden and a Democratic majority 
in the U.S. Senate and House. And 
that, then, resulted in—even though we 
had already spent so much money—an 
additional nearly $2 trillion being 
spent back in January, and now a $3.5 
trillion, which I think ultimately ends 
up costing a lot more than $3.5 trillion. 
In order for the $3.5 trillion package 
to be paid for—if it ultimately is paid 
for—the Democratic majority is pur-
suing tax hikes that will have signifi-
cant consequence on small businesses 
and farm families, both of which are so 
essential to the economic well-being of 
Kansas and many other States across 
the 
country, 
especially 
in 
middle 
America. 
Tax increases on working Americans 
should be, if at all, a last resort, not a 
funding opportunity for sweeping— 
sweeping—massive government expan-
sion. This government expansion in-
cludes funding of a radical climate 
agenda, like the Green New Deal, in-
stalling new entitlement programs, and 
increasing government intrusion into 
the lives of Americans to levels we 
have never seen before. 
While businesses are struggling to re-
coup lost revenue from the COVID–19 
pandemic—the consequences of that 
pandemic—the Democrats’ plan would 
slap more taxes on businesses and drive 
up the costs for everyone. 
We should not jeopardize our Na-
tion’s economic well-being so that 
Democrats can make good on their 
campaign promises. Voters certainly 
did not have that in mind when they 
elected such a slim majority here in 
the Senate: 50 Democrats, 50 Repub-
licans. That wasn’t a mandate for the 
kind of spending and taxing that is now 
being considered here on the Senate 
floor. 
This proposed massive influx of gov-
ernment 
spending 
is 
irresponsible. 
Americans generally know how to live 
within their means, and it is time that 
government show some fiscal restraint 
as well. 
For a long time, as I did the townhall 
meetings across Kansas, it was often 
the topic of conversation. One of the 
first things Kansans would raise with 
me is all this spending—all this deficit 
spending. And for a while that con-
versation kind of went away. Today, it 
is back. It is the topic of conversation 
at every townhall meeting I had for 
those several weeks in Kansas. It is 
what I heard at Rotary and Kiwanis 
and Lions Clubs. Americans, Kansans 
in particular, are asking for us to show 
some responsibility here, and this leg-
islation now pending shows no respon-
sibility. 
To make matters worse, as the 
Democrats have spent valuable time 
testing the limits of their power to 
pursue this tax-and-spend spree, they 
have shirked their basic duties of gov-
erning. 
The debt limit and government fund-
ing, the appropriations process, are 
clearly the province of the party in 
power. I am anxiously awaiting for our 
Appropriations Committee to be able 
to do its work. The appropriations 
work is to be completed by September 
30, which, once again, will not be the 
case. We await an agreement on topline 
spending numbers and a balance of 
prioritization between domestic and 
defense spending. While the air—the 
oxygen—is being sucked out of the Sen-
ate for purposes of a reconciliation bill 
and a $3.5 trillion-plus spending bill, we 
need to be focused on the basics of 
making sure that government doesn’t 
shut down and that we do our work in 
appropriating the necessary amounts 
for government to function. 
We have known that the suspension 
of the debt limit would expire this 
summer—that has never been in ques-
tion—but Democrats, with control of 
the White House and both bodies of 
Congress, have neglected to address ei-
ther the debt limit or the regular ap-
propriations process, the funding. They 
are now combining the issue of debt 
limit with the annual funding for gov-
ernment operations. This is what we 
call a CR, a continuing resolution, in 
which we fund the government at its 
current level into the future because 
we haven’t gotten our work done. Now 
that CR and the debt limit increase are 
tied together. This is another example 
of not owning their governing obliga-
tions, not acting as honest brokers, and 
not, certainly, seeking bipartisanship. 
They only seek bipartisanship when it 
suits their political interests. 
What you won’t hear from the major-
ity leader and my Democratic col-
leagues is that there is a clean, short- 
term continuing resolution that has 
been 
proposed 
by 
Vice 
Chairman 
SHELBY
of the Appropriations Com-
mittee and the minority leader, Leader 
MCCONNELL. In addition to avoiding an 
unnecessary lapse in government fund-
ing, the Shelby-McConnell CR includes 
funding for our ally Israel, relief for 
hurricane-stricken States, and support 
for Afghan refugees. This is an act of 
good faith, and it deserves bipartisan 
support. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
the United States of America has al-
ways paid its bills on time—always. It 
is an unbroken record that dates back 
to our founding—a 232-year streak— 
and that unbroken record has helped 
the United States become the anchor of 
the global financial system and the 
many benefits that it brings to every 
American in our country. But now, as 
we have heard on this floor over the 
last 2 days and more, Senate Repub-
licans are threatening to end that un-
broken record. 
Senate Republican Leader MCCON-
NELL has not only said that he and Sen-
ate Republicans will vote against in-
creasing the debt ceiling to allow us to 
pay bills that are already due and 
owing but that they will block a vote 
on the measure altogether. That would 
destroy our economy; it would throw 
our country into a recession; it could 
cause the loss of millions of jobs all 
over the Nation, and trillions of dollars 
of wealth would collapse. 
What makes this threat by Senate 
Republicans so especially outrageous is 
that they know exactly what devasta-
tion will be caused by their actions. In 
fact, in 2019, Senator MCCONNELL him-
self stressed the importance of raising 
the debt limit so we could avoid an un-
necessary economic meltdown. 
Here is what he said then: 
We need to address the debt limit. It se-
cures our Nation’s full faith and credit and 
ensures that Congress will not throw this 
kind of unnecessary wrench into the gears of 
our job growth and thriving economy. 
He knew, plain and simple, that re-
fusing to increase our debt limit would 
throw a wrench into the gears of our 
job growth. 
In fact, after voting to raise the debt 
limit that year, he said: 
We raised the debt ceiling because America 
can’t default . . . That would be a disaster. 
‘‘That would be a disaster.’’ That is 
what the Senate Republican said about 
what happens if you don’t raise the 
debt ceiling—the exact thing that he 
and Senate Republicans are threat-
ening to do right now. 
The 
Republican 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, was not alone in express-
ing those sentiments. When President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6638 
September 23, 2021 
Trump was in charge, Senate Repub-
licans voted to raise the debt limit 
three times, and the Democrats joined 
them in doing that when President 
Trump was in office because we, too, 
understood the consequences of failing 
to pay our bills on time. And let’s not 
kid ourselves. There are lots of things 
that President Trump and Senate Re-
publicans did over those 4 years that 
we disagreed with—policies that we 
thought were irresponsible, not good 
for the country—including the 2017 
Trump tax plan that provided huge tax 
breaks to the biggest corporations in 
the country, tax breaks to the wealthi-
est Americans, with over $2 trillion 
added to our national debt. They didn’t 
pay for a dime. Not a penny of that was 
paid for—it was all on the credit card— 
but when it came time to pay the bills 
that were due and owing for our coun-
try, the Democrats joined the Repub-
licans in lifting the debt ceiling be-
cause we knew the devastating con-
sequences of the alternative. 
Let’s also be very clear that the mon-
eys that we currently owe, that are 
currently due and owing, are largely 
made up of the debt incurred when 
President Trump was in office. The na-
tional debt increased by a total of $7.8 
trillion during that 4-year period. In 
fact, over one-quarter of our entire na-
tional debt comes from those 4 years of 
the Trump administration, and our Re-
publican Senate colleagues spent those 
4 years voting here in the U.S. Senate 
for policies that they now say they 
don’t want to pay for. They voted to 
put expenses on the credit card, and 
now, when it is time to pay the bill on 
that credit card, they are like: Sorry. 
We are out of here. The country is on 
your own. 
So this is, obviously, rank hypocrisy, 
plain and simple. If that were all, it 
would be unsurprising—in fact, sadly, 
expected—but while the hypocrisy is 
shameful, what is downright dangerous 
are the consequences of that hypocrisy. 
A recent study was done by Mark 
Zandi—he is the chief economist at 
Moody’s 
Analytics—who 
estimates 
that a prolonged default would cost the 
U.S. economy up to 6 million jobs, wipe 
out as much as $15 trillion in household 
wealth, and send the unemployment 
rate surging to, roughly, 9 percent, just 
as we are working to again stabilize 
our economy and pull out of the down-
turn that we have been in. 
Now, those predictions are fright-
ening, but they shouldn’t be surprising 
to anybody. You know, our constitu-
ents—none of us—can just decide one 
morning, as they get up, to say, ‘‘Do 
you know what? We are not going to 
make a mortgage payment. We are not 
going to make a rental payment. We 
are not going to make a payment for 
our cars,’’ without expecting to suffer 
some financial consequences ourselves. 
So imagine, one morning, that the 
Senators here—in this case, Republican 
Senators—get up and say: The United 
States of America is not going to pay 
its bills today. That sends shock waves 
throughout the entire country and sys-
tem, and that is why you get the cata-
clysmic results that Mark Zandi at 
Moody’s Analytics is predicting, and 
that is why we are hearing from every 
responsible adult that we can’t allow 
this to happen. 
Six former Secretaries of the Treas-
ury, having served under Presidents of 
both parties, have urged the congres-
sional leadership to make sure we raise 
the debt ceiling and pay our bills that 
are currently due and owing. They 
made clear ‘‘postponing action to raise 
the debt limit until too close to the 
deadline undermines confidence in our 
political system at home and abroad.’’ 
In other words, what they are saying 
is, when you go over the waterfall, you 
are in deep trouble, but even if you get 
close to it and can begin to hear the 
rumbling waters of that waterfall, so 
can the rest of the world and the finan-
cial system, and that, in itself, ends up 
causing economic damage. 
As Secretary Yellen said, it would be 
‘‘unthinkable’’ for the United States to 
do what Senate Republicans are pro-
posing to do, and the chief policy offi-
cer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
said that the United States of America 
defaulting on its obligations is not an 
option. 
They are all right. We should be lis-
tening to them and to the American 
people because, if Republicans continue 
on the path they are, it is going to 
cause job loss, and that loss in house-
hold wealth, as well, will be hitting 
families throughout this country. 
So, if the necessity of raising the 
debt ceiling is so clear, why are we 
here? 
Well, I have been listening to our Re-
publican colleagues over the last cou-
ple days, and they say, well, they don’t 
want to raise the debt ceiling because 
they don’t like the Democratic plans to 
beat COVID–19, and they don’t like the 
Build Back Better agenda. There are 
two 
fundamental 
misunderstandings 
with this argument. 
The first, as I mentioned, is that 
these are bills that are already due and 
owing, and Republicans voted for a lot 
of these policies. In fact, I have seen 
them back home in their States telling 
their constituents how they helped de-
liver relief for small businesses and 
how they helped expand broadband. 
Well, that is part of the bill that is 
coming due right now that we have to 
lift the debt ceiling to pay for. 
But they also fundamentally mis-
understand what President Biden is 
talking about in his Build Back Better 
agenda. I know, these days, it is an 
alien idea to many of our Republican 
colleagues, but President Biden and 
Democrats are planning to pay for the 
Build Back Better agenda. We are put-
ting out proposals to do that, to reform 
our Tax Code, to reform our Tax Code 
in a way that we should do anyway, re-
gardless of the important investments 
that we need to make, and to reform 
our Tax Code so that major multi-
national corporations cannot continue 
to park millions and billions of dollars 
of profits in overseas tax havens, like 
the Cayman Islands and other places, 
and shirk their obligations to this 
country and to the American people. 
We should shut down those loopholes. 
Some of those loopholes also encourage 
those companies to move their plants 
and workers overseas. We should shut 
down those loopholes. We should make 
sure that the IRS has the capability to 
enforce the current law and taxes that 
are already due and owing under cur-
rent law. The current IRS Commis-
sioner, appointed by the former Presi-
dent, has said that we lose hundreds of 
billions of dollars to people who are 
cheating on their taxes. That hurts all 
the rest of us in this country, and most 
of those people are higher income peo-
ple. We need to make sure that the 
very wealthiest people in the country— 
the billionaires—pay some taxes. We 
have seen some years when they pay 
zero in taxes, some of them. 
I keep hearing from our Republican 
colleagues that they don’t want to vote 
for this because of some future plan, 
even though what we are talking about 
now is to pay for other things that 
have been previously incurred which 
Senate Republicans voted for, and they 
are criticizing a plan which we intend 
to pay for. 
And, yes, we have planned to make 
some important investments with that 
revenue. We intend to extend the tax 
cuts for middle- and lower-income fam-
ilies with kids. They are going to ex-
pire at the end of this year, December 
31. The up to $300 a month tax cut for 
families for each child, that goes away 
if we don’t enact the Build Back Better 
agenda. 
We intend to reduce the cost of pre-
scription drugs—something that is hit-
ting every American really hard in 
their pocketbook. 
We intend to increase the avail-
ability and affordability of high-qual-
ity childcare. A lot of parents aren’t 
reentering the workforce because, like 
every parent, they want to make sure 
their child is in a safe and secure place 
during the day, and it doesn’t make 
economic sense if they have to pay as 
much for that childcare as they make 
on the job. So we need to address that 
issue. 
We want to expand Medicare to cover 
vision, dental, and hearing services. 
That is a big gap in the program. 
So I hear Republicans down here rail-
ing against the Build Back Better 
agenda 
even 
though 
every 
survey 
shows that the American people of all 
parties support that agenda. And then I 
hear them say they are not going to 
vote to lift this debt ceiling because of 
that proposal even though we are plan-
ning to pay for that proposal. 
I just heard one of our colleagues 
talking about inflation. The reality is, 
if you pay as you go, then that is not 
a problem. The problem is when people 
put everything on the credit card and 
then decide not to pay for it. That is 
what the Republicans did during the 
2017 Trump tax plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6639 
September 23, 2021 
So I would just say to my colleagues: 
You yourself are on record here in the 
U.S. Senate talking about what kind of 
economic devastation would be caused 
if the United States defaults on its 
debts if we don’t lift the debt ceiling. 
You know what that action would 
mean for American families because 
you have said it here on the Senate 
floor and around the country. So don’t 
threaten the American people and our 
entire economy with something that 
you know to be so irresponsible. 
I will end with this: You should do 
the right thing and join with Demo-
crats in lifting the debt ceiling to pay 
for bills that are already due and owing 
and that you voted for. But, for good-
ness’ sake, if you don’t want to do the 
right thing, at least get out of the way. 
At least don’t use the filibuster to pre-
vent Democrats from doing the right 
thing for the country. That is a cynical 
ploy. I don’t know what the political 
calculus is. 
I have heard the Republican leader 
say that he didn’t want the Biden agen-
da to succeed, but, for God’s sake, let’s 
put country first, and let’s make sure 
that we do the right thing for the 
American people. Let’s lift the debt 
ceiling. Let’s pay our bills on time, as 
we have done every year throughout 
our history. 
I urge my colleagues to either do the 
right thing on the vote or get out of 
the way and help the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF SARAH BIANCHI 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, yester-
day, the Senate confirmed the nomina-
tion of Jayme White to serve as a Dep-
uty U.S. Trade Representative. Today, 
the Senate has an opportunity to fill 
another important position following a 
debate on President Biden’s nomina-
tion, Sarah Bianchi, for that role. 
I am just going to speak briefly and 
outline a few key reasons why Ms. 
Bianchi is the right person for this im-
portant job and why the Senate should 
confirm her nomination today. 
She is a longtime, accomplished 
member of the Biden economic team. 
She has worked in a host of settings 
during her time in public service: the 
Office of the Vice President, the Do-
mestic Policy Council, the Office of 
Management and Budget, and as a staff 
member here in the Senate. She brings 
valuable experience in the private sec-
tor to her nomination as well. She has 
helped build a strong Biden economic 
agenda that is focused on making sure 
that all Americans have the oppor-
tunity to get ahead. 
With respect to the key issue of 
trade, which is under the jurisdiction 
of the Senate Finance Committee, that 
means fighting for American workers 
and American businesses and cracking 
down on the trade cheats that will fla-
grantly try to rip off jobs and economic 
growth. 
The variety and the depth of Ms. 
Bianchi’s experience in public service 
will be a big asset to Ambassador Tai 
and the team at USTR. 
When the Finance Committee voted 
on Ms. Bianchi’s nomination, she was 
approved by a vote of 27 to 1. I often 
say that it is a struggle to get a bipar-
tisan group of 27 Senators to even 
agree on buying a 7UP, but supporting 
the Bianchi nomination is clearly a bi-
partisan proposition on a vital eco-
nomic position. 
In fact, all of President Biden’s 
USTR nominees that have come before 
the Finance Committee, I am pleased 
to say, have gotten strong support 
from both sides of the aisle; for exam-
ple, a longtime staffer of mine, Jayme 
White—80 votes yesterday, 80 votes, 
with strong support, I might add, from 
business and labor. It is because these 
individuals are focused on getting be-
yond some of the old theories about 
trade—free trade, fair trade, and the 
like. What really brings Democrats and 
Republicans together is trade done 
right. 
That is what Ms. Bianchi is all about. 
When she is confirmed, she will take on 
a challenging portfolio at USTR, which 
includes Asia, Africa, investment, serv-
ices, textiles, and industrial competi-
tiveness. 
The headline in that list, of course, is 
taking on China. The Finance Com-
mittee has worked hard on policies de-
signed to take on China’s many trade 
rip-offs. There is China’s use of forced 
labor, for example, massive unfair sub-
sidies that destroy any semblance of a 
level playing field, theft of intellectual 
property, and the Great Firewall and 
censorship of the internet extending 
beyond China’s borders. These abuses, 
these rip-offs, directly threaten Amer-
ican jobs, innovations, and values from 
sea to shining sea. 
For the U.S. Senate, part of how 
Members must address these issues is 
confirming highly qualified and experi-
enced nominees like Sarah Bianchi, 
whose job will include confronting 
China directly. The Senate simply 
can’t afford to leave this important 
Deputy USTR role open any longer. 
Now the Senate has a top-notch nomi-
nee before us. 
I support Sarah Bianchi fully. Twen-
ty-seven members of the Finance Com-
mittee supported her earlier this year 
during our committee’s markup. I urge 
Senators to vote yes on the Bianchi 
nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SPECIAL COUNSEL DURHAM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
week, Special Counsel Durham indicted 
Michael Sussman, an attorney for the 
Hillary Clinton Presidential campaign. 
He was indicted for lying to the FBI. 
The indictment gives example after 
example of the Democratic Party’s bag 
of dirty tricks. 
In September 2016, Sussman met with 
the 
FBI’s 
general 
counsel, 
James 
Baker. At that meeting he provided in-
formation and data files that allegedly 
contained evidence of a secret commu-
nication between the Trump organiza-
tion and the Russian bank Alfa Bank. 
The evidence, however, was fab-
ricated. The allegations about the 
Trump organization being linked with 
a Russian bank—these were false. The 
email server at issue was neither 
owned nor operated by the Trump orga-
nization. 
But the lie in the indictment oc-
curred when Sussmann allegedly told 
the FBI general counsel that he wasn’t 
providing the information on any cli-
ent’s behalf. He repeated the same to 
another government agency. Those as-
sertions were apparently false. He was 
working for the Hillary Clinton Presi-
dential campaign. 
Now, interestingly, the indictment 
states that although Baker was alleg-
edly unaware of the political affiliation 
of the information starting in April 
2016, Sussmann represented the Demo-
cratic National Committee and regu-
larly met with the FBI. According to 
the indictment, the FBI failed to con-
nect the dots. What Special Counsel 
Durham’s indictment shows in signifi-
cant detail, by the way, are the steps 
that the Clinton campaign and her 
Democratic allies took to dirty up 
Trump—and did so—with known false 
information. 
Time and again, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have cast 
false information against Trump to tie 
him to a foolish conspiracy that he is 
an agent of the Russian Government. 
Time and again, when the evidence is 
made public, the Democratic Party is 
shown 
to 
be 
the 
master 
of 
the 
disinformation universe, and much of 
the so-called mainstream press fell for 
and peddled the falsehoods. 
What’s wrong with our journalists 
being journalists and investigating ev-
erything to the bottom rather than 
trying to not do their work and letting 
people get away with this sort of ac-
tion? 
Now I am going to take a few exam-
ples from the indictment. Notably, 
Sussmann 
was 
working 
with 
an 
unnamed executive at a technology 
firm that had been offered a position in 
the Clinton administration, should she 
have won that election in 2016. 
The information compiled and ana-
lyzed the false Alfa Bank information 
and, according to the indictment, ‘‘ex-
ploited access to non-public data at 
multiple internet companies to con-
duct opposition research concerning 
Trump.’’ 
To accomplish those ends, the execu-
tive enlisted ‘‘the assistance of re-
searchers at a U.S.-based university 
who were receiving and analyzing 
Internet data in connection with a 
pending federal government cybersecu-
rity research contract.’’

September 23, 2021 
Now, amazingly, the indictment later 
says that the university accessed data 
of an unnamed executive branch agen-
cy through an unnamed internet com-
pany. That unnamed internet company 
possessed that data because it was a 
subcontract ‘‘in a sensitive relation-
ship between the U.S. government and 
another company.’’ 
Apparently, taxpayers unwittingly 
assisted the false-information cam-
paign used against Trump by the 
Democrats. 
I’d like to say that you can’t make 
this stuff up, but that is exactly what 
they did. A researcher that worked to 
falsely connect Trump to Alfa Bank 
said, ‘‘We cannot technically make any 
claims that would fly public scrutiny.’’ 
They also discussed faking email ad-
dresses to try and beef up some bogus 
false connection between Trump and 
Alfa Bank. Even the unnamed tech ex-
ecutive essentially said the Alfa Bank 
data was a ‘‘red herring.’’ 
One email in the indictment even 
says in part: 
The only thing that drives us at this point 
is that we just do not like [Trump]. This will 
not fly in the eyes of public scrutiny. Folks, 
I am afraid that we have tunnel vision. 
They recognized that what they were 
doing lacked any factual support, yet 
Sussmann, the Democrats, and the 
Clinton 
campaign 
proceeded 
ahead 
anyway. 
Even more than that, Christopher 
Steele reportedly got his information 
about Alfa Bank from Sussmann and 
included it in the Steele dossier. The 
indictment clearly shows the depth to 
which the Clinton campaign went to 
smear Trump—smear—with false evi-
dence and plant it with the liberal 
media, who then willingly ran with it— 
and probably smiled as they ran with 
it. And here we are, years later, with a 
country that has been almost torn 
apart because of the Democratic Par-
ty’s fake evidence against Trump. 
Special Counsel Durham stated on 
December 9, 2019, in part, relating to 
the Justice Department inspector gen-
eral’s report on Crossfire Hurricane, 
‘‘last month we advised the Inspector 
General that we do not agree with 
some of the report’s conclusions as to 
the predication and how the FBI case 
was opened.’’ 
Special Counsel Durham has had sev-
eral years to investigate and bring a 
case forward. We have seen two in-
stances where folks have been charged 
with a crime, one already pleading 
guilty. 
One must not forget the Obama- 
Biden Justice Department’s and the 
FBI’s blatant misrepresentations to 
the FISA court during the Crossfire 
Hurricane and other serious wrong-
doing, much of which was uncovered by 
Congress and the inspector general. 
On June 29 of this year, Senator 
JOHNSON and I asked Attorney General 
Garland if he agrees with then-Attor-
ney General Barr’s statement that any 
Durham report be submitted in the 
form that will permit public dissemina-
tion. On July 13 of this year, Attorney 
General Garland said that he agrees. 
Special Counsel Durham, let’s see 
what you have got, and we will be able 
to see it when the report comes out. 
PRIVATE DEBT COLLECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. President, on one other matter, 
shorter than I just had, news accounts 
continue to mention plans to increase 
IRS enforcement funding and to impose 
onerous reporting requirements on sen-
sitive banking information to the IRS. 
These proposals raise many concerns, 
particularly in light of questions re-
garding the ability of the IRS to pro-
tect taxpayers’ information. Even this 
year, we had a whole bunch of stuff go 
public of private taxpayer information 
that, by so doing, violated the code to 
protect the privacy of taxpayers. 
However, I want to now discuss an 
existing IRS program that’s already 
collecting hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in unpaid taxes and doing it annu-
ally. I am referring to the program 
called the Private Debt Collection Pro-
gram that uses private contractors 
pursuing tax debts that the IRS would 
otherwise not pursue. This program 
was enacted as part of the infrastruc-
ture legislation signed into law 2015. 
Each year since then, annual updates 
on the program’s finances document 
very well the growing success of this 
program that is done by private debt 
collectors. As of the end of the fiscal 
year 2020, the program had collected 
nearly $1 billion in unpaid taxes. After 
accounting for the program’s cost, it 
has returned more than $678 million in 
net revenue to the Treasury. Of that 
$678 million, more than $458 million 
was from the fiscal year 2020 alone. 
Every year the program is allowed to 
function, it brings more and more 
money into the Treasury. At the same 
time, it generates resources the IRS 
uses to hire additional tax collection 
personnel. To date, the program has 
enabled IRS to hire many new employ-
ees. 
The recent IRS update for the cur-
rent fiscal year 2021 continues this 
trend. Through June, the Private Debt 
Collection Program has provided more 
than $700 million in net revenue to the 
Treasury. In other words, in the first 9 
months of fiscal year 2021, the program 
has more than doubled the revenue it 
has returned to the Treasury. The 
longer this program is allowed to work, 
the more successful it becomes. 
The proposals being put forward by 
my colleagues across the aisle are 
based on the premise that by spending 
more money, the IRS will collect more 
money. The Private Debt Collection 
Program brings in money without 
spending taxpayers’ money. 
Despite the obvious benefits of this 
program, I am very concerned that the 
IRS has suspended providing additional 
cases to the program until the end of 
September. Commissioner Rettig as-
sured me in responses to written ques-
tions that the additional cases would 
be provided on September 27. 
I am going to hold Commissioner 
Rettig to that statement and, in the 
upcoming days, expect to see him keep 
his word to me. 
All the handwringing over spending 
more money to increase IRS enforce-
ment and information reporting shows 
the serious issues involved in those 
proposals. 
The IRS Private Debt Collection Pro-
gram is proven to collect taxes already 
owed, allows the IRS to hire more per-
sonnel, and costs nothing up front. 
Anyone serious about closing the tax 
gap should support and encourage the 
full use of this program, the Private 
Debt Collection Program. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. I would ask unani-
mous consent that, at the end of my re-
marks, the scheduled vote take place. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as 
chairman of the Senate Budget Com-
mittee, I want to say a few words about 
some of the important budgetary issues 
that Congress is now facing. I want to 
focus on the $3.5 trillion reconciliation 
bill, but before I do that, I want to 
comment on the looming debt crisis 
that we face. 
The 
Republican 
leader, 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL, this morning once again 
reiterated that the Republican Party 
will not vote to lift the debt ceiling; 
and in an extraordinarily irresponsible 
manner, Republicans have indicated 
that they will not pay the debts in-
curred under the Trump administra-
tion. 
In his statement, as he has done time 
and time again, Senator MCCONNELL 
implies that this debt ceiling has some-
thing to do with future spending. It 
does not. 
In his statement, as he has done time 
and time again, Senator MCCONNELL 
implies that this debt ceiling has some-
thing to do with future spending. It 
does not. Like anyone who owns a cred-
it card, the payments that are made 
are for past spending—in this case, 
spending incurred under the Trump ad-
ministration. 
Let us be clear. If the United States, 
the largest economy in the world, de-
faults on its debt, it will plunge not 
only our country but the entire global 
economy into what could become a se-
vere economic depression. That means 
massive unemployment, higher inter-
est rates, severe reduction in govern-
ment services, and possible cuts in 
such programs as Social Security and 
Medicare. 
The irresponsibility of the Repub-
lican leadership is not just something 
that I worry about. According to press 
reports, former Republican Secretaries 
of Treasury Hank Paulson, who worked 
under George W. Bush, and Steven 
Mnuchin, who worked under Donald 
Trump—Republican Secretaries of the 
Treasury—both of them visited with 
Senator MCCONNELL to make the case 
about the need to extend the debt ceil-
ing. They understand, as I think all of

September 23, 2021 
us do, how important it is that the 
United States of America does not de-
fault on its debt, and it is about time 
that my Republican colleagues listen 
to them. 
Now, let me say a word about the $31⁄2 
trillion reconciliation bill. There has 
been a lot of talk lately about the need 
to compromise. Well, let me be clear. 
To a very significant degree, that has 
already taken place. Of the 11 Demo-
cratic members of the Senate Budget 
Committee, 9 understood the need for a 
$6 trillion bill, which would finally ad-
dress the unmet needs—the long-ig-
nored needs—of the working families of 
our country, as well as begin the proc-
ess of tackling the existential threat of 
climate change. My guess is that at 
least 40 out of the 50 Members of the 
Democratic caucus supported the $6 
trillion proposal. We compromised big 
time. We cut that proposal—agreed to 
cut that proposal—almost in half, down 
to $31⁄2 trillion. That, to my mind, is a 
major, major compromise. 
As we go forward in this debate, let 
me be as clear as I can be as to why 
every penny of that $31⁄2 trillion is ab-
solutely needed, and let me also make 
clear that this bill, despite some of the 
rhetoric coming from my Republican 
colleagues, will not add—should not 
add and will not add one nickel to the 
deficit. 
It will be paid for. It will be paid for 
by finally demanding that some of the 
wealthiest people in this country, who 
in any given year—we are talking 
about multibillionaires who in a given 
year do not pay a nickel in Federal in-
come tax or dozens of large, profitable 
corporations that in a given year do 
not pay a nickel in Federal income tax. 
Well, we are going to demand that 
these people start paying their fair 
share of taxes, and that is more than 
enough money to cover the $31⁄2 trillion 
that is in this proposal. So anyone who 
suggests to you that this bill is not 
going to be paid for and that it is going 
to add to the deficit is simply not tell-
ing the truth. It should and will be 
fully paid for. 
Now, the media is very worried about 
process. When are we going to do this? 
What about that person? What about 
that Senator? But they have forgotten 
to a large degree to talk about what is 
in the bill. I am not quite sure that the 
average American is staying up nights, 
worrying about whether it is completed 
on a Wednesday or a Friday or what 
this Senator thinks or what that Sen-
ator thinks; they would like to know 
what is in the bill. 
The reality is that for many, many 
decades, while Congress has paid rapt 
attention to the needs of the wealthy 
and large campaign contributors, it has 
significantly 
ignored 
the 
needs 
of 
working families, the middle-class, and 
low-income people. I think the reason 
that many of my Republican colleagues 
are so upset about this legislation is 
that we are changing the dynamic. We 
are now beginning to pay attention to 
the needs of working families and not 
just the wealthy and the powerful. 
So what is in this bill? First, as a re-
sult of the extraordinarily successful 
American Rescue Plan, which went a 
long way to pull this country out of the 
severe economic decline that we expe-
rienced as a result of the COVID pan-
demic, as a result of the American Res-
cue Plan, we cut childhood poverty in 
the United States of America by over 
50 percent, and for Black and Brown 
families, that cut was even higher. 
Year after year, the United States 
has the highest rate of childhood pov-
erty of any major country on Earth. 
We took a major step forward in cut-
ting childhood poverty. Now it is clear 
to me and I think to people all across 
this country that we must extend the 
$300-a-month-per-child direct payment 
that working-class and middle-class 
families now receive. 
Let me be very clear. If we do not 
pass the reconciliation bill and not 
continue those payments, we would 
once again plunge the children of this 
country, millions of them, back into 
poverty, and that is morally unaccept-
able. 
Furthermore, in the United States of 
America, every person should be out-
raged by the dysfunctionality of our 
childcare system. I don’t think there is 
anybody who disagrees with that. We 
have millions of people who cannot 
find childcare. We have families in 
Vermont and Maine paying 20, 30, 40 
percent of their limited incomes for 
childcare, which is pretty crazy. We 
have childcare workers who are em-
ployed at starvation wages. The system 
is not working. It is broken. It is dys-
functional. 
It is not a radical idea to say that 
every family in America, when mom 
goes to work and dad goes to work, 
should be entitled to high-quality and 
affordable childcare. There are a lot of 
studies out there that say that the best 
investment we can make of Federal 
dollars is to our children, and that is 
why we have got to expand what we are 
doing in childcare. Under this legisla-
tion, no working family in this country 
will be paying more than 7 percent of 
their income for childcare. So if you 
are paying 20 percent now or you are 
paying 30 percent, we will reduce that 
to no more than 7 percent. 
On top of that and of extraordinary 
significance, we are going to make pre- 
K education for 3- and 4-year-olds uni-
versal and free, and we are going to do, 
bottom line, what almost every other 
industrialized country on Earth does 
and understand that the most impor-
tant investment we can make is in our 
children. 
By the way, importantly, when we do 
that, we are going to allow well over a 
million women to go back into the 
workforce because they no longer will 
have to stay home because of a lack of 
affordable childcare. So if you are wor-
ried about labor shortages all over this 
country, you must support signifi-
cantly expanding our childcare capa-
bilities. 
Further, what is in this legislation 
is, at a time when the pharmaceutical 
industry charges us the highest prices 
in the world for prescription drugs, we 
are going to demand that Medicare 
start negotiating prescription drugs 
with the pharmaceutical industry. 
I know that Americans now have 
seen a lot of the ads—the completely 
dishonest ads from the pharmaceutical 
industry, and let’s be clear. Over the 
last 20 years, the pharmaceutical in-
dustry has spent well over $4 billion on 
lobbying and hundreds and hundreds of 
millions more on campaign contribu-
tions. Guess what. They own the U.S. 
Congress. And that is why—when you 
walk into a pharmacy and you find 
that the price of your medicine has 
doubled, it is because they can do any-
thing they want to do. They write the 
laws. They, right now, have 1,400 lobby-
ists running all over Capitol Hill, try-
ing to make sure that we do not lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. And that 
is what this struggle is about. 
These guys, year after year, make 
outrageous profits. Their CEOs get ex-
traordinary compensation benefits, and 
they do that by charging us by far the 
highest prices in the world for prescrip-
tion drugs. Well, those days are coming 
to an end if Members of the Congress 
finally have the guts to stand up to 
them. 
Now, I understand that the pharma-
ceutical industry owns the Republican 
Party. I got that. And I understand 
that there will not be one Republican 
in the Senate who has the guts to stand 
up for his or her constituents and lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. Well, 
there should not be any Democrat who 
is in that position. There should be no 
Democrats who are not prepared to 
stand up to the pharmaceutical indus-
try. 
When we have Medicare negotiate 
prescription drug prices, we can save 
over $500 billion. One of the things we 
are going to do with that $500 billion is 
do what the American people des-
perately want us to do, and that is to 
expand Medicare to cover dental, vi-
sion, and hearing aids. This is the 
United States. Elderly people should 
not walk around without any teeth in 
their mouths. They should be able to 
afford to go to a dentist. It is not a 
very radical idea. Grandparents should 
be able to communicate with their 
grandchildren because they have a 
hearing aid that they need in their ears 
that today they cannot afford. Older 
people should be able to read their 
daily newspaper because they can get a 
pair of glasses that works for them. 
The need to expand Medicare to cover 
dental, hearing aids, and eyeglasses is 
absolutely critical. Nobody in the year 
2021 denies that oral health, hearing, 
and 
vision 
are 
essential 
parts 
of 
healthcare. Medicare is supposed to 
cover the healthcare needs of seniors. 
Well, oral health, hearing, and vision 
are parts of healthcare. 
Not surprisingly, out of all of the 
provisions in President Biden’s Build 
Back Better plan, expanding Medicare 
to provide dental, vision, and hearing

aids is by far the most popular. Accord-
ing to a June 30 Morning Consult poll, 
adding dental, vision, and hearing ben-
efits to Medicare is supported by 84 
percent of the American people. It is 
not often you get 84 percent of the 
American people supporting anything. 
And yet that includes 89 percent of 
Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans. 
This is what the American people 
want, and this is what we must deliver 
for them. 
Given that, it is just hard for me to 
imagine that any Member of the House 
or Senate would oppose this very pop-
ular and important provision. 
It is a bit embarrassing that our Na-
tion, the richest on Earth, is the only 
major country not to guarantee paid 
family and medical leave. I have been 
all over this country, and I have met 
with women—low-income women—who 
are forced to go back to work 1 week 
after having their baby because they 
need the income. We are the only 
major country on Earth not to guar-
antee paid family and medical leave, 
not to make sure that a mom can stay 
home with her sick kid or a dad can 
spend time with his dying father or 
mother. 
This legislation finally does what 
should have been done a long, long 
time ago and guarantees paid family 
and medical leave. 
And what this legislation does is ad-
dress the reality that many of our 
younger people are unable to obtain 
the good-paying jobs that are out there 
because they lack the ability to get a 
higher education. 
Now, my own view is we should make 
public colleges and universities tuition 
free. My own view is we should cancel 
all student debt in this country. That 
is not in this bill. But what is in this 
bill is the reality that every American 
will have the right to get at least 2 
years of community college tuition 
free. And they can use that to get the 
training they need for jobs. They can 
use that to accumulate credits that 
can be transferred to a 4-year college, 
if that is what they desire. 
A few blocks away from here and in 
every major city in America, there are 
Americans sleeping out on the streets. 
They are veterans. They are people 
with all kinds of issues. They are work-
ing people who simply cannot afford 
the housing in their community. Two 
blocks away from the U.S. Capitol 
there is an encampment of homeless 
people. Six hundred thousand Ameri-
cans are homeless today, and on top of 
that, we have some 18 million house-
holds that spend 50 percent of their 
limited incomes on housing. 
In other words, we have a major 
housing crisis. This legislation address-
es that, and, in an unprecedented man-
ner, invests in low-income and afford-
able housing. And when we do that, by 
the way, we create a whole lot of good- 
paying jobs. 
We are an aging society. And whether 
people 
have 
severe 
disabilities 
or 
whether they are just getting old, peo-
ple would rather stay at home in many 
cases rather than be forced into nurs-
ing homes. What our legislation will do 
is 
to 
significantly 
improve 
home 
healthcare in this country and make 
sure that those people who provide 
that important service, that difficult 
service, are adequately compensated, 
because today they are not. We need 
more of those workers, and we need to 
pay them decent wages. 
I am sadly aware that many of my 
Republican colleagues do not believe 
that climate change is real or, at the 
very least, don’t believe that we should 
do anything about it. But they are dead 
wrong. In my view, we cannot go home 
and look our children and grand-
children in the eye knowing what we 
know and knowing that the scientists 
are telling us that we have a very, very 
few years to address the climate crisis 
or else there will be irreparable harm 
done in our country and around the 
world. 
We have turned on the TV this past 
summer, and we saw the unbelievable 
fires in Oregon and California and 
learned that in Siberia their fires were 
larger than all the other fires com-
bined; smoke went thousands of miles. 
We learned that July was the hottest 
month ever and that climate is exacer-
bating extreme weather disturbances 
like Hurricane Ida, which brought 
havoc to Louisiana. 
This legislation that we are pro-
posing does not go as far as I think it 
should on climate. But make no mis-
take about it. It is a major, major step 
forward in transforming our energy 
system away from fossil fuel to energy 
efficiency and sustainable energy. 
So that is where we are right now. 
We are at a moment where millions 
and millions of Americans have lost 
faith in their government. They think 
that we are incapable of addressing 
their needs, that all we do is listen to 
wealthy campaign contributors and the 
lobbyists and the billionaire class. 
The question we face right now is, At 
this moment, do we have the courage 
to keep faith with the American people 
and show them that their democracy in 
fact can work for them and not just 
powerful special interests? 
So let us go forward. Let us do the 
right thing. Let us pass this $31⁄2 tril-
lion reconciliation package. 
With that, I yield the floor.

NORD STREAM 2 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I want to 
talk today about Russia. I want to talk 
about Vladimir Putin. I want to de-
scribe to this Chamber a bipartisan vic-
tory that together we won, and then I 
want to describe, tragically, how Presi-
dent Joe Biden is giving that victory 
away to Putin and Russia. 
To understand this issue, we need to 
go back to the summer of 2019. In the 
summer of 2019, Russia was in the proc-
ess of constructing a pipeline called 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
Behind me is a map demonstrating 
where the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline runs. 
It is a pipeline that was to run from 
Russia to Germany, going underneath 
the Baltic Sea. 
In the summer of 2019, the pipeline 
was nearly complete. At various peri-
ods in time, it was 70 percent complete, 
80 percent complete. There was wide-
spread consensus that if this pipeline 
were completed, it would have dev-
astating consequences. In a few min-
utes, I will discuss those consequences 
in greater detail. But in an effort to 
stop the devastating consequences, I 
worked on bipartisan legislation, along 
with Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, Demo-
crat from New Hampshire, and we in-
troduced bipartisan sanctions legisla-
tion designed to stop the Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline. 
That legislation, when we introduced 
it, was almost immediately subject to 
a Russian disinformation campaign. In 
Europe, the Russians were saying to 
anyone who would listen that the Cruz- 
Shaheen 
sanction 
legislation 
could 
never pass; that there was no way Con-
gress would come together in a bipar-
tisan manner to stop the Nord Stream 
2; that it was hopeless; that no one 
needed to be concerned that this legis-
lation could pass. They also made the 
argument 
as 
part 
of 
their 
disinformation campaign that the pipe-
line was nearly complete so that U.S. 
sanctions could not stop it. There was 
nothing that could be done to stop it. 
Well, to the surprise of nobody who 
follows 
these 
issues, 
that 
Russian 
disinformation was precisely that—it 
was disinformation. It was lies. 
In the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, Senator SHAHEEN
and I 
worked with our colleagues, and our 
legislation was initially voted out of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee by an overwhelming bipartisan 
vote of 20 to 2—overwhelming bipar-
tisan support. 
At that point, Senator SHAHEEN and I 
began working to get it passed on the 
floor of the Senate. While we were 
doing so, the Russian disinformation 
continued: This cannot pass. 
We endeavored to have our sanctions 
legislation attached to the National 
Defense Authorization Act, which was 
moving in the fall and winter of 2019. 
To do so was not easy. To do so, we 
needed to get the explicit signoff of the 
chairman and the ranking member of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. We needed the explicit signoff 
of the chairman and the ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee. We needed the explicit signoff 
of the chairman and the ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Banking Committee. 
Then we needed the explicit signoff of 
Senator MCCONNELL and Senator SCHU-
MER, the Republican and Democratic 
leader respectively. All eight of those 
Senators needed to agree with our legisla-
tion for this to proceed on the NDAA. 
And then we had to do the exact 
same thing in the House of Representa-
tives and get the chairman and ranking 
member 
on 
Foreign 
Relations, 
on 
Armed Services and on Banking, and 
we had to get the signoff of NANCY 
PELOSI and KEVIN MCCARTHY. 
To get the explicit support of all 16 of 
those congressional leaders—8 Repub-
licans and 8 Democrats—in any world 
is not easy. 
And I will say on my part and Sen-
ator SHAHEEN’s part, we invested doz-
ens, if not hundreds, of hours in terms 
of talking to our colleagues to build 
that bipartisan consensus, and we 
ended up getting that overwhelming 
support. In many ways, that support 
was miraculous. 
Why is that? 
Well, one of the reasons why Nord 
Stream 2 is particularly problematic is 
that Russia is building Nord Stream 2 
in order to cut off Ukraine. There is 
currently a pipeline running through 
Ukraine and, through Nord Stream 2, 
Russia 
has 
the 
power 
to 
starve 
Ukraine. 
Why is it miraculous in December of 
2019 that we were able to pass this leg-
islation? 
Well, if you will recall what was hap-
pening in the House of Representatives 
in December of 2019, the House of Rep-
resentatives was in the middle of im-
peaching President Donald Trump for 
alleged high crimes and misdemeanors 
concerning Ukraine. 
If you will recall, from the trial we 
held on this Senate floor, central to 
the allegations that were raised by 
Democrats against President Trump 
was conduct concerning Ukraine. 
It remains astonishing that right in 
the middle of a partisan gladiatorial 
battle concerning Ukraine, simulta-
neously we were able to get Repub-
licans and Democrats to work hand-in- 
hand to agree with complete consensus 
that we were going to come together 
and stop the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
We were going to stop what Vladimir 
Putin was doing. 
In December of 2019, our legislation 
passed. The Cruz-Shaheen sanctions 
legislation passed. Now, I will remind 
you what the Russian disinformation 
did when we first introduced it. They 
said it will never pass; and they said, 
even if it does pass, it is too late for it 
to have any effect. 
Well, if my memory serves me cor-
rectly, President Trump signed the 
Cruz-Shaheen sanctions legislation at 7 
p.m. on a Thursday. At 6:45 p.m. on a 
Thursday, 15 minutes before our sanc-
tions legislation was signed into law, 
the company that was laying the pipe-
line in the Baltic Sea announced it had 
immediately halted laying the pipeline

September 23, 2021 
and it was lifting anchor and sailing 
away. It was an incredible bipartisan 
victory. The pipeline was stopped in its 
tracks. 
What happened next was absolutely 
nothing. For a year, the pipeline lay 
dormant. The talking points from 
Vladimir Putin—and now, sadly, adopt-
ed by Joe Biden and his administra-
tion—is the pipeline is 90 percent com-
plete or the pipeline is 95 percent com-
plete. But it is not rocket science that 
a 90-percent complete pipeline is zero- 
percent complete. Until you build both 
ends of the pipeline, it ain’t nothing 
but a hunk of metal at the bottom of 
the 
ocean. 
Nothing 
is 
traveling 
through it until the pipeline is com-
plete and online. 
For a year, the pipeline lay dormant. 
Then in the year 2020, Senator SHAHEEN 
and I joined together again in a second 
round of bipartisan legislation, a sec-
ond round of sanctions. We had stopped 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline in its 
tracks. For a year, Putin was stopped 
altogether. 
And we came together for a second 
piece of legislation—the second version 
of Cruz-Shaheen—and just like the first 
sanctions, we passed it through both 
Houses of Congress and it was signed 
into law with overwhelming bipartisan 
support—nearly unanimous support of 
all 535 Members of Congress. 
So we now had two major pieces of 
sanctions legislation on the books. 
Those sanctions had been working for a 
year and the pipeline was stopped. 
Then in November of 2020 was the 
Presidential election. And in the wake 
of the Presidential election, Joe Biden 
and his transition team almost imme-
diately began telegraphing weakness to 
Russia. Members of Joe Biden’s foreign 
policy advisory team in the German 
newspapers expressed openness to Nord 
Stream 2 being built, expressed a will-
ingness to try to circumvent the sanc-
tions that had been working and had 
worked for over a year. Within days of 
Joe Biden and his team expressing 
weakness to Putin, Russia and Putin 
heard and they began the process of 
getting ready to return to building the 
pipeline. 
(Thereupon, 
Ms. 
STABENOW 
as-
sumed the Chair.) 
Russia did return to building the 
pipeline. Do you know what day? Janu-
ary 24, 2021. Four days after Joe Biden 
was sworn into office, Putin said: We 
are safe. We are free. Our man Joe is in 
the White House. 
And we know that the administra-
tion is not going to follow U.S. law 
anymore. And so on January 24, the 
Russians returned to building the pipe-
line. 
Now, for 2 years, this body had been 
united, Republicans and Democrats, 
that we were going to stop this pipe-
line; but Joe Biden and his administra-
tion decided instead to waive the sanc-
tions, decided instead to give Vladimir 
Putin what amounts to a multibillion- 
dollar gift—and not just a gift one 
time. If this pipeline is allowed to go 
online, it will put billions of dollars in 
Putin’s pockets every year, year after 
year after year. 
What are the consequences of Nord 
Stream 2? 
No. 1, Russia gets richer; Russia gets 
stronger; Russia gets billions of dollars 
that it can use to build its military, to 
threaten its neighbors, to threaten our 
allies, to endanger the lives of Ameri-
cans and our friends. 
No. 2, Europe is hurt. Our friends and 
allies in Europe are made even more 
dependent on Russian energy. 
Our former colleague in this body, 
Senator John McCain—may he rest in 
peace—had a phrase for Russia that 
was memorable, that I have used many 
times. He referred to Russia as ‘‘a gas 
station with a country attached.’’ 
That is Putin’s plan. It is very sim-
ple. Putin is a petrol tyrant. He is a ty-
rant, he is a bully, he is a KGB thug, 
and all his aggression is funded by sell-
ing oil and gas. 
Together, Republicans and Demo-
crats in Congress had taken billions 
out of Putin’s pockets; and, sadly, Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS decided the 
world would be a better place if instead 
Putin had billions more not just this 
year or next year, but for decades to 
come. 
When Putin is dead and buried and 
the next dictator is ruling over Russia, 
that next dictator will be reaping the 
benefits of this pipeline. Indeed, as a 
result of Joe Biden’s decision, many 
are referring to this pipeline as the 
Biden-Putin pipeline for a very simple 
reason: It is Putin who is building it; it 
is Putin who is profiting by it. 
And the only reason Putin is allowed 
to do so is because President Joe Biden 
has given a multibillion-dollar gift 
that strengthens Russia and it weakens 
Europe. 
It makes Europe subject to energy 
blackmail. Putin has demonstrated a 
willingness and, indeed, a history of 
using energy blackmail, of using those 
who are dependent on natural gas to 
coerce them to do what he wants. In 
the dead of winter, when people are at 
risk of freezing to death, Putin has 
threatened to—and has, in fact—cut off 
gas to endanger the lives of innocent 
civilians in order to coerce govern-
ments to bend to his will. 
As a result of Joe Biden’s surrender 
to Vladimir Putin, Putin will have the 
continued ability to exercise economic 
blackmail against Europe. 
But not only that. Europe has energy 
needs. Those energy needs could be 
readily satisfied by American energy. 
Europe has expressed a willingness and, 
in some instances, an eagerness to im-
port American energy. 
But Joe Biden has decided that 
American jobs are unimportant. On his 
first day in office, Biden shut down the 
Keystone Pipeline, killing 11,000 jobs in 
the 
United 
States, 
including 
8,000 
union jobs—8,000 high-paying union 
jobs that, with a stroke of a pen, Joe 
Biden eliminated. 
And at the exact same time that 
Biden is shutting down jobs and a pipe-
line in America, he is green lighting 
and giving Putin a gift of a pipeline be-
tween Russia and Germany, producing 
jobs in Russia, producing billions of 
dollars in Russia, and taking away jobs 
in America. 
This pipeline is a disaster. As the 
afternoon goes on, I will elaborate on 
different aspects on which it is harmful 
and on the steps we can and should be 
taking to stop it. 
But at this point, Senator BARRASSO 
is here and has some thoughts he wish-
es to express, and so I will yield the 
floor to Senator BARRASSO for his re-
marks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Wyo-
ming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to add my voice to that of Mr. 
CRUZ, the Senator from Texas, about 
Joe Biden’s surrender to Vladimir 
Putin. 
Energy is called the master resource 
for a reason. It powers our country, 
powers our military, powers this Na-
tion, powers the economy. And yet Joe 
Biden, on his first day in office, seemed 
to take us from a nation of energy 
dominance to energy dependence, can-
celing the Keystone Pipeline and now 
approving this pipeline, Nord Stream 2. 
I come to add my voice to all of 
those, and there are many who have 
spoken out against the President in ex-
pressing our deep concerns about this 
administration’s unwillingness to fully 
sanction the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline 
and to allow it to move ahead. 
I am sure Senator CRUZ, as part of 
his discussion this afternoon, will talk 
about the confirmation hearing of 
Tony Blinken to be Secretary of State. 
We asked him specifically about the 
pipeline, and he said he would stop it, 
no matter what. Even though it was 
down to the last—I think he may have 
said—100 yards, they would stop it. 
That is not what happened. We saw 
Joe Biden surrender. 
For years, we have been sounding the 
alarm about this Russian trap. 
This pipeline, who built it? 
Gazprom. 
Who are they? 
They are the Russian state-owned 
natural gas monopoly. 
We have all quoted and, in the past, 
have heard Senator McCain talk about 
Russia, a country acting as a gas sta-
tion or a gas station acting as a coun-
try. I think one time he went on to say 
that Russia was a Mafia-run gas com-
pany disguised as a country. 
This dangerous pipeline is going to 
double the amount of Russian natural 
gas going to Germany via the Baltic 
Sea. Completion of the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline is going to further tighten its 
grip on European gas supplies and ex-
tend the threatening influence because, 
as I said before, energy is the master 
resource. 
We know Russia uses energy to co-
erce and to manipulate. They use it as 
a geopolitical weapon. They coerce and 
manipulate our allies and our partners

September 23, 2021 
in Europe. Many of our NATO allies— 
Germany, in particular—are becoming 
dependent upon and addicted to Rus-
sian gas. Europe already gets 40 to 45 
percent of its gas imports from Russia. 
The new export pipeline helps Russia 
undermine Europe’s efforts to diversify 
energy sources, suppliers, as well as 
the routes. 
Nord Stream 2 makes Europe more 
energy dependent on Russia and, of 
course, more prone to Russian influ-
ence. At the same time, it is going to 
further fuel Russian aggression, Rus-
sian intimidation, and Russian insta-
bility across Europe. 
Putin is a powerful foe who aims to 
divide Europe and to destroy the NATO 
alliance. He has been broadcasting 
those plans. This is not a surprise. The 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline would mean a 
massive 
money 
transfer 
from 
our 
NATO allies straight into the Krem-
lin’s coffers. This means more re-
sources to put toward Russia’s desta-
bilizing activities. 
And we continue to see an increase in 
these destabilizing activities. Russia 
occupies territory in Ukraine, Georgia, 
and Moldova. Russia launched a mili-
tary buildup on Ukraine’s border. Rus-
sia poisoned and then imprisoned a po-
litical opposition leader. Russian hack-
ers are creating economic chaos by dis-
rupting American supply chains. 
Russia could use these cash reserves 
in what way? Well, a way to fund ag-
gression in Europe and around the 
world. And it is interesting that Putin 
even funds environmental activists in 
Europe to shut down energy where they 
would be exploring for natural gas and 
oil. He wants environmental activists 
to protest any efforts for the European 
countries to develop their own gas re-
sources so he can hold them hostage in 
this way as well. 
Well, President Biden’s weakness on 
Putin’s pipeline is going to have seri-
ous consequences, not just the finan-
cial ones for Russia and not just those 
in Europe but worldwide. And for our 
security and for the security of our al-
lies, I believe we must stop this Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. 
That is why Congress has overwhelm-
ingly, this body, passed several pieces 
of bipartisan legislation. You know, 
people say to me: Can’t you do any-
thing in a bipartisan way in Congress 
anymore? 
I would say: Well, we certainly did 
when it came to the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. We passed bipartisan legisla-
tion imposing sanctions on this very 
project. 
Yet, this administration, the Biden 
administration—the 
surrendering 
Biden administration—is unwilling to 
implement the laws that are on the 
books. President Biden waived congres-
sionally mandated sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2 AG, which is the company 
overseeing the pipeline construction. 
By using a national interest waiver, 
this administration gave Russia the 
green light to speed ahead to comple-
tion of this pipeline. 
Look, there is strong opposition to 
President Biden’s deliberate failure to 
follow the law when it comes to this 
pipeline and the supply of energy from 
Russia to Europe. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a letter dated March 3 of this year in 
which I led a group of 40 Senators in 
outlining our concerns. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MARCH 3, 2021. 
Hon. JOSEPH BIDEN, 
President of the United States, 
The White House, Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN: We write to ex-
press our deep concern about the refusal of 
the Administration to impose sanctions on 
entities involved in the Nord Stream II pipe-
line. With construction on the project cur-
rently taking place, there is publicly avail-
able information on vessels and companies 
engaging in sanctionable activities. The fail-
ure of the Administration to identify and im-
pose new sanctions signals its willingness to 
allow President Putin to gain a stranglehold 
over Europe’s gas supplies and increase its 
geopolitical leverage. We call on the Admin-
istration to correct its misguided actions by 
quickly and fully implementing the sanc-
tions mandated by U.S. law. 
The Protecting Europe’s Energy Security 
Act (PEESA), as amended by the Protecting 
Europe’s Energy Security Clarification Act 
(PEESCA), mandates sanctions on the com-
panies and individuals involved in the Nord 
Stream II pipeline. The law requires sanc-
tions against entities installing pipes, engag-
ing in pipelaying activities. or insuring or 
certifying that installation, those activities, 
and other activities associated with the pipe-
line. As construction is under way, time is of 
the essence. The United States must act now 
to prevent the pipeline from being com-
pleted. 
For years, it has been the policy of the 
United States to oppose the Nord Stream II 
pipeline, which would carry natural gas from 
Russia across the Baltic Sea to Germany. 
The intent of Congress is crystal clear. Con-
gress overwhelmingly passed several pieces 
of bipartisan legislation imposing sanctions 
on this project including the Countering 
America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions 
Act (CAATSA), PEESA, and PEESCA. The 
Administration cannot turn a blind eye to 
those who violate our laws. We request the 
Administration utilize all of the tools at its 
disposal to implement additional sanctions 
immediately, especially the most recent 
round of sanctions in PEESCA that both 
houses of Congress urgently and repeatedly 
passed last year. 
On February 19, 2021, the Administration 
submitted a congressionally mandated re-
port on entities actively supporting, assist-
ing, and working with those involved in the 
Nord Stream II pipeline. The Administration 
made the troubling decision to identify only 
the Russian pipelaying vessel Fortuna and 
its owner KVT–RUS, both of which were al-
ready sanctioned under the Trump Adminis-
tration in January. The report also listed 18 
entities which have ended their involvement 
in the project, due to the extensive diplo-
matic efforts of the Trump Administration 
to wind down their activities. This com-
pletely inadequate report undermines the bi-
partisan efforts of Congress and previous Ad-
ministrations by not listing the other vessels 
involved in pipelaying and pipelaying activi-
ties as well as companies providing insur-
ance and certification services. 
We call on you to fix this error by imme-
diately identifying and sanctioning the addi-
tional entities without delay. While sanc-
tions are being quickly processed on individ-
uals and companies, we ask you to formally 
notify these entities of the forthcoming 
sanctions and call on them to stop their 
work on the Nord Stream II pipeline. In addi-
tion, PEESCA also mandates consultation 
with our allies, which must be conducted and 
concluded expeditiously. 
As you have previously stated, the Nord 
Stream II pipeline is a ‘‘bad deal for Eu-
rope.’’ This point has been clearly dem-
onstrated by Europe’s growing opposition to 
the project. On January 21, 2021, the Euro-
pean Parliament overwhelmingly passed, by 
a vote of 581–50, a resolution calling on the 
European Union to immediately stop the 
completion of the Nord Stream II pipeline. 
Previously, on December 12, 2018, the Euro-
pean Parliament passed a resolution describ-
ing the Nord Stream II pipeline as a ‘‘polit-
ical project that poses a threat to European 
energy security’’ that should be cancelled. It 
passed by a vote of 433–105. 
The Nord Stream II pipeline makes Amer-
ican allies and partners in Europe more sus-
ceptible to Moscow’s coercion and malign in-
fluence. It would reinforce Russia’s near-mo-
nopoly and control of natural gas in the re-
gion. In addition, the project would weaken 
efforts to diversify Europe’s energy sources, 
suppliers and routes. The Nord Stream II 
pipeline would also provide Russia an oppor-
tunity to damage the economy of Ukraine 
and to further its aggressive actions in the 
region. 
We appreciate your statements as well as 
those made by members of the Administra-
tion publicly opposing the Nord Stream II 
pipeline. It is now time to act. It is critical 
that the United States enforce our laws and 
hold those entities accountable for assisting 
Russia in building this dangerous pipeline.

John Barrasso, James E. Risch, Ron 
Johnson, Ted Cruz, Cynthia Lummis,

Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
in this letter, signed by 40 Senators, we 
called out the Biden administration for 
refusing to impose sanctions on enti-
ties involved in the construction of 
this very pipeline. 
It is a lengthy letter, and I am not 
going to read the whole thing, but let 
me point out, the letter says this: 
The failure of [this] Administration to 
identify and impose new sanctions signals its 
willingness to allow President Putin to gain 
a stranglehold over Europe’s gas [supply] and 
increase its geopolitical leverage. We call on 
the Administration to correct its misguided 
actions by quickly and fully implementing 
the sanctions mandated by U.S. law. 
It has been over 6 months, and Presi-
dent Biden still refuses to follow the 
law. Through his inaction, President 
Biden is gifting Russia a new geo-
political weapon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6646 
September 23, 2021 
And one of the things I found most 
astonishing, in terms of this adminis-
tration taking us from energy domi-
nance to energy dependence, is what 
happened just last month. The Biden 
administration, seeing the impact of 
rising energy costs and rising gasoline 
costs—people in Wyoming paying more 
than $25 extra every time they fill 
their tank compared to the day that 
President Biden came into office—he 
said: We need to do something. 
His National Security Advisor actu-
ally went to say: We need to ask OPEC 
Plus to produce more oil and to 
produce more energy. 
Well, who is OPEC Plus? Well, it is 
Saudi Arabia, and it is Russia. In our 
Energy Committee, of which I am the 
ranking member, Senator MURKOWSKI, 
the Senator from Alaska, came to the 
committee and told members of the 
committee that currently the United 
States is using more energy produced 
from Russia than it is from her home 
State of Alaska. What does that tell 
you about this administration and the 
commitment of this administration to 
energy needs in this country—in our 
own country? 
It is very disturbing to see the Presi-
dent act in such a reckless way regard-
ing our Nation, our economy, and our 
energy security, and continuing to give 
gifts like this to our enemies. It is 
much better to sell energy to our 
friends than have to buy energy from 
our enemies, but that is what appeared 
on the White House website, put there 
by the National Security Advisor to 
the President just last month, asking 
Saudi 
Arabia 
and 
OPEC 
Plus 
to 
produce more energy to help lower the 
cost at the pump for people in the 
United States here at home. 
Well, why do you think we have it, 
Mr. President? You killed the Keystone 
XL Pipeline and put a longstanding 
moratorium now on gas production on 
Federal lands, which continues. There 
still has not been a lease sale since the 
day you signed that Executive order 
and the day you came into office. 
We need to force the President to act 
on this critical issue of the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. Yesterday—just yes-
terday—the U.S. House of Representa-
tives—the body down the hall, with 
NANCY PELOSI as the Speaker of the 
House, the House of Representatives— 
passed an amendment to the National 
Defense Authorization Act imposing 
new mandatory sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2. It would repeal the national 
interest waiver for sanctions under ex-
isting law. Look, this is an incredibly 
important step, and I would look for-
ward to it quickly becoming law. 
Protecting this Russian trap that 
they have laid for the Germans and for 
Europe—the noose around the neck, 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline—it is in 
our national security interest to block 
that, but yet this administration is not 
doing it, and I believe it is a grave mis-
take on the part of this administra-
tion. 
While President Biden has failed to 
do the right thing, there is still time. 
The administration can reverse course 
and fully sanction the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. And if President Biden re-
fuses, Congress is prepared to take 
strong actions to protect the energy se-
curity of our Nation and our allies. 
And with that, I thank Senator CRUZ 
for allowing me to join in support of 
the comments that he is making. We 
have been wonderful partners, and 
other Members on the floor, in a bipar-
tisan way, with a specific focus on 
what is happening with Russia and its 
efforts to undermine the United States, 
to undermine NATO, and to try to go 
back to, as they have said, put the 
band back together—reestablish the 
former Soviet Union, which Vladimir 
Putin has stated is his goal all along. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I thank 
the Senator from Wyoming for his pow-
erful remarks, and I thank each of the 
Senators who have worked with me, 
both Republicans and Democrats, in 
our successful effort for over a year to 
stop the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline—suc-
cessful, right until Joe Biden became 
President. 
I want to talk now about the precise 
dangers that are posed by the comple-
tion of Nord Stream 2. Many agree it 
would be a catastrophe for the security 
of the United States and for our Euro-
pean allies. 
Nord Stream 2, if it goes online, 
would double the gas flowing from Rus-
sia to Germany while circumventing 
American allies that Putin targets 
militarily, diplomatically, and com-
mercially. As a result, if Nord Stream 
2 goes online, it will expose Ukraine 
and Poland to deep, long-term dangers, 
and it will leave them vulnerable the 
next time Russia targets them for ag-
gression. 
Right now, one-third of Russian gas 
exports 
to 
Europe 
travel 
through 
Ukraine. That provides Ukraine a curi-
ous kind of protection because Putin 
knows that he can’t endanger that en-
ergy 
infrastructure 
without 
endan-
gering his economic line to the world. 
With Nord Stream 2, Putin and Rus-
sia are given, by Joe Biden and by 
KAMALA HARRIS, effectively open sea-
son on Ukraine. And when a year from 
now we see Russian tanks in Ukraine, 
we will remember this moment that it 
was Joe Biden’s surrender to Putin on 
Nord Stream 2 that enabled Russia to 
carry out that aggression. 
If Nord Stream 2 goes online, it will 
enrich Putin with billions of dollars to 
direct toward his malign activities. 
And, by the way, if you don’t want to 
take my word for it, here is what the 
Polish Prime Minister said about Nord 
Stream 
2; 
that 
Nord 
Stream 
2 
‘‘strengthens 
Russia’s 
power, 
helps 
President Putin to build a military 
power, [and] helps to intimidate other 
nations.’’ 
In addition, if Nord Stream 2 goes on-
line, it will solidify Russian energy 
dominance at the expense of European 
energy diversification. If Nord Stream 
2 goes online, it will deepen the corrup-
tion that tragically is endemic across 
Russia’s energy sector, and it will ex-
port more of that corruption to Eu-
rope. 
But I want to talk a bit more about 
the crushing, overarching danger of 
Russia using Nord Stream 2 for black-
mail and for coercion. Putin uses en-
ergy as a weapon. We have seen that 
pattern over and over again. He uses 
energy for blackmail and coercion. He 
turns it off or on to punish resistance 
to his expansionism. 
This is a real, acute, and proven 
threat. Russia turned off the gas to Eu-
rope in the winter months of 2006 and 
again in 2009 because of political dis-
putes. The Kremlin company that owns 
and 
would 
run 
Nord 
Stream 
2, 
Gazprom, has repeatedly cut off gas to 
Ukraine during political crises. It is 
open blackmail, and because of Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS, Putin will 
have more power to blackmail our 
friends in Europe. 
And it is not only me; it is not only 
Republicans; and, indeed, it is not only 
Republicans and Democrats in Con-
gress who understand the magnitude of 
this threat. Our European allies under-
stand fully just how disastrous Nord 
Stream 2 would be. 
Ukrainian President Zelensky has 
said that it is flatout ‘‘wrong’’ ‘‘not to 
notice that’’ Nord Stream 2 ‘‘is a dan-
gerous weapon’’ not only for Europe, 
‘‘not only for Ukraine but for the 
whole of Europe.’’ 
I want you to pause and reflect. 
President Zelensky of Ukraine said 
this pipeline is a dangerous weapon di-
rected at Ukraine and the whole of Eu-
rope. Why is it being built? Because 
Joe Biden decided to give it as a gift to 
Vladimir Putin. 
In a meeting with the Biden adminis-
tration, the Polish Deputy Foreign 
Minister said: 
Poland considers this project to be detri-
mental to the security of not only Ukraine, 
not only Central Europe, but also to the se-
curity of the whole of Europe, making the 
EU dependent on Russian gas. 
If we give a damn about our friends 
in Poland, if we give a damn about our 
friends in Ukraine, if we give a damn 
about our friends in Europe, don’t 
allow Joe Biden to allow Vladimir 
Putin to point this weapon at the heart 
of Europe. 
In a joint statement signed by rep-
resentatives of the Foreign Affairs 
Committees of the Parliaments of Es-
tonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Re-
public, Ireland, Poland, Ukraine, and 
the United Kingdom, here is what the 
Estonian Foreign Affairs Committee 
stated: ‘‘Countering malign Russian 
aggression is in the vital national secu-
rity interest of the whole of NATO, the 
EU and our partners in Central and 
Eastern 
Europe,’’ 
and 
that 
‘‘Nord 
Stream 2 is a geopolitical project 
geared towards expanding Russia’s in-
fluence on Europe, through energy 
dominance.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6647 
September 23, 2021 
A question for every Member of this 
Senate to decide: Do we care about en-
dangering the national security, about 
threatening, about making our Euro-
pean friends subject to blackmail? Do 
we care about what Estonia has told 
us, about what Latvia has told us, 
about what Lithuania has told us? Do 
we care about the Czech Republic? Do 
we care about Ireland? Do we care 
about 
Poland? 
Do 
we 
care 
about 
Ukraine? Do we care about the United 
Kingdom? 
Well, our actions can decide that. Un-
fortunately, Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS have decided that our European 
allies, their security is not of sufficient 
concern to them. And, instead, they 
have actively given this pipeline to 
Vladimir Putin. 
My Democratic colleagues and, in-
deed, the vast majority of American 
lawmakers, also understand the precise 
danger of blackmail and coercion posed 
by Nord Stream 2. 
In 2018, Senator COONS, my Demo-
cratic colleague from Delaware, said 
quite plainly that ‘‘we have to work 
with Europe to reduce its dependence 
on Russian energy exports and in par-
ticular to convince it to discontinue 
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia 
to Germany.’’ Senator COONS contin-
ued: ‘‘As long as Russia dominates the 
provision of energy to Europe it will 
continue to hold a veto over many Eu-
ropean policies and [it] will be in a po-
sition to weaken and marginalize coun-
tries like Poland and Ukraine.’’ 
Senator COONS was right in 2018, and 
what he said is right today. 
Joe Biden is committing a genera-
tional political blunder, a catastrophic 
mistake that hurts American national 
security and that hurts European secu-
rity. 
Congress has repeatedly passed sanc-
tions targeting Nord Stream 2, tar-
geting Russia’s corrupt energy market 
more broadly. Those sanctions, espe-
cially CAATSA and PEESA—and I am 
going to discuss in greater detail, later 
today, the specific sanctions legisla-
tion that is on U.S. books that Joe 
Biden is ignoring, that he is flouting, 
that he is disregarding, that he is re-
fusing to enforce. Those sanctions im-
pose mandatory sanctions. This body, 
Congress as a whole, Democrats and 
Republicans, past administrations—ev-
eryone has worked together not just to 
counter Russia but, specifically, to pre-
vent Putin from being able to leverage 
energy as a geopolitical weapon. 
The Biden administration, however, 
tells us they have a better solution, a 
better solution than both Houses of 
Congress, a better solution than fol-
lowing U.S. law. Instead of imposing 
sanctions to stop the pipeline, they tell 
us they have worked out a deal with 
Germany that they promise will pre-
vent Putin from being able to use en-
ergy as a weapon. It is the best of both 
worlds, they say. They don’t have to 
use sanctions, and they still solve the 
problem of Russian energy blackmail. 
President Biden said: ‘‘Chancellor 
Merkel and I are absolutely united in 
our conviction that Russia must not be 
allowed to use energy as a weapon to 
coerce or threaten its neighbors.’’ 
Those are nice sentiments, if they 
weren’t accompanied with Joe Biden 
giving a multibillion-dollar genera-
tional gift to Putin to do exactly what 
President Biden just said he didn’t 
want Putin to do. 
Here is how an official from the 
Biden State Department described the 
deal: ‘‘There’s a clear commitment on 
the part of the United States and Ger-
many in this statement that should 
Russia attempt to use energy as a 
weapon’’—and, as an aside, they have 
done so over and over and over and 
over again in the past—‘‘should Russia 
attempt to use energy as a weapon . . . 
Germany will take action at the na-
tional level and press for effective 
measures at the European level, includ-
ing sanctions to limit Russian export 
capabilities to Europe in the energy 
sector, and that includes gas and/or 
other economically relevant sectors.’’ 
So understand what they are saying. 
If and when Russia does what they 
have done in the past over and over 
again, if they do—one of the reasons 
they want Nord Stream 2 is to exercise 
economic blackmail. If and when they 
do that, Germany is going to send a 
really stern letter to the European 
Union. 
One of my favorite movies that Heidi 
and I have watched many times is a 
movie called ‘‘Team America.’’ It is a 
comedy. It is done by the creators of 
the movie ‘‘South Park.’’ It is a movie 
that involves puppets. I will give a 
warning: It is a movie with an enor-
mous amount of profanity in it. It is 
also one of the most sidesplittingly 
funny movies ever made. 
In ‘‘Team America,’’ they talk about 
Hans Blix and the tool of sending a 
stern letter to the United Nations. The 
movie ‘‘Team America’’ understand-
ably ridicules that as being utterly in-
effective. In the case of that movie, it 
was North Korea. But in the case of 
Putin, I assure you, Vladimir Putin has 
not lost 1 minute of sleep worrying 
about Germany’s letter to the Euro-
pean Union. 
Once Nord Stream 2 goes online, it 
will become a dominant source of en-
ergy for Europe. Putin knows this. 
Merkel knows this. Biden knows this. 
Turning off Nord Stream 2, which 
Germany has suggested: Oh, once we 
are addicted to the crack, we will just 
turn it off when we don’t want it any-
more—that would be suicidal, which 
Putin knows, and he is counting on it. 
It is as empty and hollow a threat as 
has ever been uttered on the inter-
national stage. And, even worse, we al-
ready know that it is a hollow threat 
because Putin has already, in just the 
last few days, crossed the line into 
using energy as a weapon. 
So we don’t have to go back to 2006. 
We don’t have to go back to 2009. Let’s 
go back to last week. 
In just the last week, it has become 
clear that Putin has been turning down 
gas exports to Europe to coerce our al-
lies into dropping opposition to Nord 
Stream 2. 
The blackmail is open, and it is bra-
zen. Russian and Gazprom officials 
have said: If Germany and the EU ap-
prove Nord Stream 2 coming online, 
then the Russians will turn exports 
back up. 
On Friday, more than 40 Members of 
the European Parliament called for an 
investigation of the coercion, saying 
Gazprom was driving up prices to 
‘‘pressure’’ the European Union into 
speeding Nord Stream 2 activation. 
So I want you to pause and reflect. 
The Biden administration’s claim to 
prevent Nord Stream 2 being used as a 
weapon for energy blackmail is, if Rus-
sia ever does it, Germany will stand up 
to them. 
Russia is doing it right now—not in 
2006—well, yes, they did in 2006. Not in 
2009—well, yes, they did in 2009. Today, 
last week—and they are not hiding it. 
They are saying: We are going to cut 
off your energy until you approve Nord 
Stream 2. 
How exactly is the Biden administra-
tion claiming they are going to prevent 
the malign use of this pipeline? They 
are literally surrendering to blackmail 
right now for no reason. 
You know, sadly, the reason—over 
the past 9 months, I have had conversa-
tions with just about every senior 
Biden State Department nominee, in 
my office, over and over and over 
again, about Nord Stream 2. Almost to 
a person, the nominees agree: Nord 
Stream 2 would be terrible. It would be 
disastrous. It would be bad for Amer-
ica. It would be bad for Europe. It 
would be good for Russia. 
They all agree with that. By the way, 
Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, 
said so vociferously in his confirmation 
hearing, and he said so even more vo-
ciferously sitting on the couch in my 
office. They all admit this. 
So why, then, would Biden have com-
mitted this disastrous mistake? Sadly, 
I think there are two reasons. One, the 
Biden team entered office with an al-
most pathological revulsion to any-
thing the previous administration did. 
If the Trump administration did it, it 
must be wrong and must be reversed. 
Now, listen. None of us in this Cham-
ber are naive. We understand politics. 
We understand that when one party 
takes over from the other party, they 
often reverse policy decisions. That is 
not unusual. 
Obama reversed decisions of the Bush 
administration. Trump reversed deci-
sions of the Obama administration. 
And there are a whole lot of decisions 
of the Trump administration that, 
sadly, from my perspective, Biden is re-
versing. As a general matter, that is 
why we have elections, and there are 
differences between the policy posi-
tions between the two parties. 
But the Biden team is further than 
that. It is almost a pathological ‘‘if 
Trump did it, it must be bad.’’ Never 
mind that the Trump administration

September 23, 2021 
did this only after the Congress came 
together in an extraordinary moment 
of bipartisan unity and passed this as 
mandatory legislation. 
In my office, over and over again, 
with just about every senior Biden 
State Department nominee, I asked 
them: Please don’t turn one of the big-
gest foreign policy victories of the last 
several years into one of the biggest 
foreign policy defeats of the last sev-
eral years. 
The reports came out, actually, that 
State tried to honor its commitment; 
that State—the Department of State— 
in the interagency process, argued for 
‘‘let’s follow the law; let’s impose the 
sanctions.’’ And what public reports 
have suggested is that the Biden White 
House—the political operatives in the 
Biden White House—overruled State. 
So even though State knew that the 
right policy was ‘‘shut down the Putin 
pipeline’’ and the wrong policy was 
‘‘turn it into the Biden-Putin pipe-
line,’’ the Biden White House des-
perately wanted to stamp their impri-
matur on this, because if it was done 
under President Trump, they were 
going to reverse it. 
The second reason is that the Biden 
foreign policy team, for whatever rea-
son, has a deep and abiding interest in 
giving to Germany whatever it is they 
want. 
Now, look, Germany is an important 
friend and ally. We work together 
closely with Germany on economic 
matters, on diplomatic matters. We 
have long and positive relationships 
with our friend and ally Germany. It 
doesn’t mean we agree with everything 
the Germans do, any more than we 
agree with everything any other ally of 
ours does. 
Indeed, I will point out, in the past 
week, the Biden administration precip-
itated the French withdrawing their 
Ambassador from America—an extraor-
dinary moment, which, I will point out, 
at least illustrates that we have a his-
tory of having disagreements, and 
sometimes serious disagreements, with 
our friends and allies. 
But one friend of mine has a phrase— 
he puts it—that the Biden foreign pol-
icy establishment, they sleep with vo-
tive candles of Angela Merkel under 
their beds; that they view Chancellor 
Merkel as someone who must be sur-
rendered to, acquiesced to no matter 
what. Never mind that Chancellor 
Merkel has an extremely limited ten-
ure in office. She is on her way out. 
Never mind that the next successor 
government in Germany may well de-
cide that they don’t even want Nord 
Stream 2. This Biden foreign policy 
team, perhaps as a farewell gift to An-
gela Merkel, has decided that Presi-
dent Biden should surrender to Putin. 
That makes no sense. That is dan-
gerous. It is harmful to Europe, it is 
harmful to Germany, it is harmful to 
America, and it helps Russia. 
We are going to have an extended pe-
riod of time to continue to discuss 
these matters, but at this point, I see 
that Senator SHAHEEN is preparing to 
speak, so I yield the floor to Senator 
SHAHEEN. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from New 
Hampshire. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. I appreciate my col-
league from Texas being willing to turn 
over the floor so that I can give my re-
marks. 
Mr. President, I am here today to dis-
cuss my concerns about the ongoing 
partisan obstruction in the Senate. 
First, as everyone here knows, Sep-
tember 30 is the end of the current fis-
cal year, and without action by the 
Senate on a continuing resolution—the 
mechanism to continue to fund the 
government—our government is going 
to shut down at midnight on the 1st. 
So what happens if we don’t pass that 
continuing resolution and the govern-
ment shuts down? Well, critical oper-
ations will shutter. We have seen this 
picture before. Our national parks will 
close. We can tell our government re-
searchers, including Nobel Prize-win-
ning scientists, to leave their labs, and 
we would be doing this in the middle of 
the greatest health crisis of our life-
time. 
A government shutdown also means 
that we ask essential Federal workers 
to work without pay. FBI agents, Bor-
der 
Patrol 
agents, 
TSA 
workers, 
weather forecasters, and others would 
be forced to continue their essential 
work, and they would be doing it for 
IOUs. We would promise them we 
would pay them, but there is no guar-
antee. 
Now, it is puzzling to me because 
other countries don’t do this to them-
selves. 
Government 
shutdowns 
put 
America behind. Look at the govern-
ment shutdown that we had that went 
from December 2018 to January 2019, 
the longest government shutdown in 
our history. While our space scientists 
were at home, China landed the first 
rover on the dark side of the Moon— 
something that we had not done. 
The continuing resolution before us 
also includes resources that will help 
Americans whose homes were flooded, 
homes 
were 
destroyed 
by 
raging 
wildfires or by hurricanes, including 
Hurricane Irma. They deserve our help, 
not more political infighting or par-
tisan bickering. 
We also owe it to our Afghan allies, 
who put their lives on the line to assist 
U.S. soldiers, to pass this bill. It con-
tains critical assistance to help them 
resettle after facing imminent danger 
from the Taliban. 
So from emergency housing assist-
ance to resources for health screenings, 
job training, and other essential serv-
ices, we can’t let our allies down. We 
have already let some of them down be-
cause we weren’t able to get everyone 
out of Afghanistan, and we are still 
working on that. But to then say ‘‘You 
are on your own’’ despite years of help-
ing the United States? That is just pat-
ently unfair. 
Secondly, as we are discussing the 
continuing resolution and keeping the 
government open, one of the things 
that our colleagues, our Republican 
colleagues, have said is that they are 
not going to increase the debt limit. I 
think we in Congress have a solemn ob-
ligation to protect the full faith and 
credit of the U.S. Government. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen has told 
Congress that the Treasury will ex-
haust 
extraordinary 
measures 
that 
they have been using to pay our Na-
tion’s bills sometime next month. And 
let’s be clear. The prospect of the first- 
ever default on our Nation’s debt obli-
gations would be disastrous for our 
economy at a time when we can least 
afford it. 
Raising the debt ceiling is not about 
whether or not we should spend more 
money or incur more debt; raising the 
debt ceiling is about paying the bills 
we already owe, the bills that come due 
from the previous administration. 
Minority Leader MCCONNELL himself 
has voted to increase or suspend the 
debt limit 32 times. And when Presi-
dent Trump was in office, Democrats in 
this Chamber—and I was one of them— 
supported raising the debt ceiling three 
times because we understand that it is 
grossly irresponsible for us to renege 
on obligations that our government 
has already incurred. 
As a former Governor, one of the 
worst fears I had as New Hampshire 
went through challenging times during 
a recession, during a court-ordered 
change in how we funded our schools, 
was that the State would have its bond 
rating lowered. That would mean we 
would have to pay more on money 
owed. It would have an impact on ev-
eryone in New Hampshire. This is sort 
of the equivalent of having the bond 
rating lowered for New Hampshire, 
only 100 times, 1,000 times over. No; 
this is that on steroids. 
Now, because we have a Democratic 
President, Republicans are saying they 
won’t lift a finger to prevent this cata-
strophic outcome for our economy, for 
our currency, for the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America. 
This is not a game. The stability of our 
economy and the financial security of 
working Americans are at stake, and 
we have an obligation to pass legisla-
tion that has been sent to us by the 
House to keep our government open 
and to raise the debt limit. This isn’t 
just about the United States; this has 
implications for our entire global fi-
nancial system. 
Sadly, Mr. President, the partisan 
brinkmanship and obstruction doesn’t 
end with domestic and economic mat-
ters. I am also very concerned about 
the 
dangerously 
slow 
confirmation 
process of our State Department nomi-
nees and Ambassadors. What we have 
seen is a few Members of this body who 
are threatening our national security 
by slowing the process to schedule 
nomination 
hearings 
for 
qualified 
nominees, preventing votes on those 
State Department nominees who have

been approved by the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
Today, only two Ambassadors have 
been confirmed by the Senate. This ad-
ministration has had to wait over 200 
days for its first Ambassador to be con-
firmed, compared to only 62 days for 
the previous administration. For the 
first 300 days of the previous adminis-
tration, 55 State Department nominees 
were confirmed by the Senate, and 
now, as we approach the first 300 days 
of the Biden Presidency, this Senate 
has only confirmed 14 appointees. 
Now, I agree with my colleague from 
Texas about the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line. I think we need to sanction it. 
But I am not willing to shut down the 
government, to allow the actions of 
this government to grind to a halt be-
cause I am concerned about that issue. 
If Senators are concerned about our 
national security, they would match 
deeds with words and confirm career 
State Department nominees who have 
been waiting for months. When we look 
at the increasing global threats to the 
United States, operating with a de-
pleted diplomatic corps jeopardizes our 
national security, U.S. interests, and 
the safety of Americans at home and 
abroad. 
These political games are really risk-
ing serious consequences. It must stop. 
I know we can work together in a ra-
tional, bipartisan way to address the 
country’s needs. I have seen it. I be-
lieve my colleagues who are holding 
things up love this country, but I am 
concerned that their actions don’t 
show that they love the country. 
There is no excuse for delaying or 
hindering the basic functions this leg-
islative body is constituted to perform, 
and I urge all of our colleagues to join 
us, to get to work. Let’s get this done. 
Maybe, if we do that, we can address 
some of the other concerns that we 
have that we ought to be able to work 
together and compromise to get done. 
That is what I am going to continue to 
try to do, Mr. President. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. 
LEE. 
Mr. President, George 
Washington, in his farewell address to 
the Nation, warned us against foreign 
entanglements and costly wars. He and 
the other Founders knew firsthand the 
danger 
that 
enduring 
engagement 
abroad posed to our Republic and to 
the cause of freedom. 
Despite 
those 
warnings, 
we, 
the 
United States, have been embroiled in 
a directionless, trillion-dollar war in 
Afghanistan for the past 20 years. 
And after all that investment—the 
American blood and treasure poured 
into that cause—Americans watched in 
horror as any semblance of the so- 
called progress and investment in a 
democratic Afghanistan crumbled in a 
matter of weeks. Haunting images 
demonstrating this failure tragically 
played out before us. Americans hadn’t 
seen tragedy of this type since the Fall 
of Saigon. 
The Costs of War project at Brown 
University estimates that the total 
monetary cost of our war in Afghani-
stan amounts to $2.3 trillion, counting 
U.S. military spending, both on and off 
budget. U.S. manpower, resources, and 
expertise were dedicated for decades to 
the war in Afghanistan. 
So we must ask ourselves: What went 
wrong? 
I rise today to explain how the ero-
sion of Congress’s constitutional war- 
making role permitted and, in fact, en-
abled these failures. 
In the early years of the war, Con-
gress shrugged as the President trans-
formed the mission in Afghanistan. 
President Bush addressed the Nation 
and the servicemembers going to war 
in October of 2001, promising ‘‘To all 
the men and women in our military— 
every sailor, every soldier, every air-
man, every coastguardsman, every Ma-
rine—I say this: Your mission is de-
fined; your objectives are clear; your 
goal is just.’’ 
At the time, the mission was clear. 
The goals were to capture the terror-
ists responsible for the September 11 
attacks, neutralize the threat posed by 
al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and ensure 
the Taliban was not strong enough to 
provide a safe harbor to al-Qaida. 
In 2003, we had substantively accom-
plished each of those goals. Though 
killing Osama bin Laden would take 
until May of 2011, the Taliban had fall-
en and the leaders of al-Qaida went 
into hiding outside of Afghanistan. And 
yet, despite this reality, the Bush ad-
ministration shifted the mission to 
physically rebuilding Afghanistan and 
reshaping the country’s government 
and culture as if to mirror our own. 
Even as the mission in Afghanistan 
was changed dramatically and unreal-
istically, Congress did not repeal or re-
place or amend the 2001 authorization 
for the use of military force in Afghan-
istan. 
The Constitution charges the legisla-
tive branch to not only fund but also 
declare and oversee wars, and yet Con-
gress seemed unaffected by the rather 
dramatic change in mission and strat-
egy. 
As a result, the war continued for 
longer than it should have—much 
longer—and the United States contin-
ued to lose tax dollars, lives, and any 
attachment to the original goals all at 
the same time. 
As building a democratic Afghani-
stan became the new mission, Presi-
dents of both parties and the inter-
agency apparatus ignored explicit evi-
dence of failure and, in fact, doubled 
down on American investment and in-
volvement. 
The Special Inspector General for Af-
ghanistan Reconstruction—created by 
Congress to oversee and audit funds 
used for nation-building in Afghani-
stan—has delivered 427 audits and more 
than 250 reports to Congress since 2008, 
detailing the risks, the waste, and the 
mismanagement in the U.S. mission. 
Many of these reports pointed out con-
tradictions of our aims and explained 
the waste, fraud, and abuse plaguing 
the funds Congress appropriated for the 
reconstruction projects of all sorts. 
Now, thanks to the investigative 
journalism of Craig Whitlock of the 
Washington Post, ‘‘The Afghanistan 
Papers’’ added another layer to the in-
spector general’s reports, revealing evi-
dence that high-ranking officials in the 
Department of Defense, in the State 
Department, and the White House 
knew that the U.S. mission had no 
focus, no metrics, no clear coordina-
tion, and no defined enemy. 
Douglas Lute, a three-star Army 
General who served as the Afghanistan 
war czar under President Bush and 
President Obama, is quoted in the pub-
lished interview saying ‘‘We were de-
void of a fundamental understanding of 
Afghanistan—we didn’t know what we 
were doing.’’ 
While I share the view with the ma-
jority of Americans that withdrawing 
forces from Afghanistan was the right 
choice and was, by all accounts, inevi-
table at some point, the Biden adminis-
tration’s disastrous withdrawal was the 
culmination of American failure in Af-
ghanistan. 
Kabul fell to lawlessness and mass 
panic. Afghan security forces laid down 
arms to the Taliban. Afghan President 
Ashraf Ghani fled his nation. And the 
evacuation was so poorly directed that 
potential terrorists and men with child 
brides secured seats on U.S. evacuation 
flights while American citizens were 
left behind enemy lines. Our Nation 
lost 13 servicemembers, with many 
more seriously wounded, to a terrorist 
attack, and the administration ineptly 
responded by killing 10 innocent civil-
ians, including 7 children. 
President Biden’s closing of the war 
in Afghanistan has been riddled with 
avoidable mistakes, resulting in both 
tragedy and embarrassment of historic 
magnitude. The President and other 
high-ranking officials must be held ac-
countable for this failure. Anyone else 
engaging in such mismanagement of 
our actions in a theater of war would 
surely be held accountable, and they 
must too. 
Throughout 20 years of engagement, 
Congress itself has shamefully failed to 
respond to an executive branch plun-
dering powers that constitutionally be-
long to Congress. It is time for Con-
gress to do its job. It is time to ensure 
that such a grave mistake that cost us 
so much in American taxpayer re-
sources, 
but 
most 
importantly 
in 
American blood, will never, ever hap-
pen again. 
Some of my colleagues and I may dis-
agree on when and exactly how to use 
military force, but we should debate 
those matters in the light of day for

the American people to view and, even 
more importantly, for the American 
people to influence. U.S. engagement 
in Afghanistan over the last decade and 
the recent blundered withdrawal de-
mand that we prioritize such a debate. 
It is long, long overdue. 
That is why I, along with my col-
leagues across the aisle, Senator CHRIS 
MURPHY and Senator BERNIE SANDERS, 
introduced the National Security Pow-
ers Act, which would restore Congress’s 
role in national security decision-
making. This is an opportunity to pro-
tect our constitutional order. Amer-
ican citizens and especially those who 
serve in our military deserve nothing 
less. 
Despite our political differences, as 
members of the branch of government 
most accountable to the people, we feel 
the weight of American blood and 
treasure sacrificed in our Nation’s 
wars. We may not have all the an-
swers—I certainly don’t claim to have 
them, but we put forth a really thor-
ough, well-reasoned, much-needed set 
of reforms to ensure that America is 
not thrown into another endless war 
without 
continual 
congressional 
input—congressional input that is not 
just helpful; it is not just a good idea, 
but congressional input that is actu-
ally required by the Constitution itself. 
It is that kind of input that has been 
neglected. And, sadly, it has been ne-
glected not just by the executive 
branch, but it has been neglected by 
the Congress, by the very people who 
are supposed to wield it. 
See, there is a big difference when it 
comes to war-making power between 
our system of government and the one 
we left behind—the one that was based 
in London. As Alexander Hamilton ex-
plained in Federalist No. 69, this was 
one of the key design features of the 
Constitution, one of the things that 
differentiates it from our former Lon-
don-based system of government. 
There, the Chief Executive—that is 
the monarch; in those days, King 
George III—would take the country to 
war unilaterally. It was up to Par-
liament then to figure out how to fund 
it. Our Founding Fathers decided to 
make a break from that practice. They 
did not give this power to declare war 
to the Chief Executive, no. They gave 
that power only to the branch of gov-
ernment that would stand accountable 
to the people at the most regular inter-
vals, the legislative branch. 
When we denigrate this role, when we 
minimize this responsibility, when we 
shirk this duty, we do so to our own ev-
erlasting shame and in violation of the 
oath that each and every one of us has 
taken to support the Constitution of 
the United States. 
In this Republic, Congress can no 
longer sit idle while the Executive 
alone decides the fate of our Nation’s 
wars and those who fight in them. 
While we can’t change history, we can 
live up to the ideals of our Constitu-
tion. I pray that we will. And I know 
that together we can, we must, and we 
will. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska is recognized. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, there 
have been a lot of discussions on the 
floor today—and I fully support them— 
about an important, important role of 
the U.S. Senate that we need to take 
on with regard to our oversight respon-
sibility of what the entire country has 
recently observed as a fiasco, debacle, 
with regard to foreign policy in Af-
ghanistan that is going to have con-
sequences for years. 
Like all of us, I was home over Au-
gust when all of these images on TV 
were unfolding. And I will tell you, I 
don’t think I have ever seen my con-
stituents madder about a single issue 
than this. It wasn’t just Republicans. It 
was across-the-board Alaskans. 
Why? 
Because they saw our great country 
humiliated. They witnessed time and 
time again the President of the United 
States, the Commander in Chief, tell-
ing them blatant falsehoods that they 
knew were falsehoods, and there is yet 
to be any accountability on this. 
Now, the hearings have begun. We 
have had two hearings on the Armed 
Services Committee, but they continue 
to insist on keeping them classified. No 
reason to do that. We need to have 
these hearings out in the open. The 
American people want to see them. 
We had hearings on the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee this past week, and 
we started to see the beginnings of the 
Biden administration’s strategy as it 
relates to explaining this fiasco, this 
debacle. 
What is it? 
Remarkably, it is to blame Donald 
Trump—if you watch the Secretary of 
State testify in front of the Foreign 
Relations Committee—and then blame 
the Generals, and then continue to 
quote the President of the United 
States that this withdrawal in Afghan-
istan was ‘‘an extraordinary success.’’ 
Let me repeat that: An ‘‘extraordinary 
success.’’ 
That is what the President of the 
United States has called this. And, un-
fortunately, his Secretary of State, his 
Under Secretary of Defense—who testi-
fied in front of the Armed Services 
Committee just a couple of days ago in 
a hearing that was the height of 
deniability on any responsibility—all 
of them continue to cling to this bla-
tant falsehood that every American 
knows is not the case. 
This wasn’t an extraordinary success, 
what we witnessed in Afghanistan. The 
whole country knows that. In fact, the 
whole world knows that. 
This is the cover from a few weeks 
ago of The Economist magazine—pret-
ty honest, well-respected magazine. 
Much of the world reads it. 
And that is what The Economist 
called it: ‘‘Biden’s debacle.’’ If you look 
in the magazine, it goes into several 
articles 
about 
the 
implications 
of 
Biden’s debacle. Here are some of the 
names, titles of the articles in this 
magazine: ‘‘The fiasco in Afghanistan 
is a huge and unnecessary blow to 
America’s standing’’ in the world. That 
is not an extraordinary success. How 
about this one from another article in 
The Economist: ‘‘Joe Biden blames ev-
eryone else.’’ That is not account-
ability. And then perhaps most impor-
tantly: ‘‘The big win for China in Af-
ghanistan is seeing America humbled.’’ 
These are articles in an international 
magazine—a 
well-respected 
inter-
national 
magazine—that 
the 
whole 
world is reading, and this is what hap-
pened in Afghanistan. It wasn’t an ex-
traordinary success; to the contrary, it 
was a debacle. It was a debacle. 
Now, some things are becoming in-
creasingly clear. The administration 
tries to defend this, tries to explain it. 
As The Economist magazine mentions, 
this is President Biden’s fiasco. Despite 
attempts by the civilian leadership in 
the Biden administration to explain 
this away with regard to blame on 
Donald Trump or the generals, this was 
100 percent President Biden’s decision 
and debacle. 
It is becoming increasingly clear 
even in the classified hearings that we 
have had on the Armed Services Com-
mittee that the President’s senior mili-
tary advisers said to the President: Do 
not do this, sir. Do not go to zero with 
our troops. Instead, you should keep a 
small force there. 
Furthermore, it is becoming increas-
ingly clear that the President’s mili-
tary advisers then said to the Presi-
dent: If you do go to zero, if you do get 
rid of all our troops—especially if they 
are pulled out before others leave—you 
are going to see many bad things hap-
pen tactically, operationally, strategi-
cally for our country. 
In essence, what Americans wit-
nessed and saw on TV in August—this 
was predicted. The President was told 
this. He ignored this advice, so he owns 
this debacle. What he needs to do now 
is tell the truth about it. He and his ad-
ministration need to tell the truth 
about it. 
There are many things that are dis-
turbing about what has happened over 
the last several weeks in Afghanistan, 
but what has been so disturbing is not 
only how the President has been blam-
ing everyone but himself; it is that 
when he talks to the American people 
about this issue, he has clearly not 
been telling the truth, and the Amer-
ican people know it. 
Let’s start with the issue I just men-
tioned: the advice that the President 
received from his military advisers. 
President Biden was on a media 
interview show on August 18 as this 
whole fiasco was unfolding. He was 
asked: 
Your top military advisors warned against 
withdrawing on this timeline. They wanted 
you to keep about 2,500 troops. 
That was the question from George 
Stephanopoulos. 
The President of the United States 
said: 
No, they didn’t. 
Later, Stephanopoulos pressed: Your 
military advisers told you not to do

this, that ‘‘we should keep 2,500 troops’’ 
in Afghanistan. 
The President of the United States: 
No. No one said that to me that I can re-
call. 
That is not true. That is not true. 
During that same interview, George 
Stephanopoulos said: 
We’ve got, like, 10,000 to 15,000 Americans 
in the country. . . . Are you committed to 
making sure that [American] troops stay 
until every American who wants to [leave 
gets] out? 
That was the question. 
The President said: 
Yes. 
I am quoting him: 
If there’s American citizens left, we’re 
gonna stay— 
The military is going to stay— 
[until we] get them all out. 
That is a quote from the President of 
the United States. That wasn’t true. 
In a later interview, the President 
mentioned that al-Qaida is all gone 
from Afghanistan. That isn’t true. We 
know that. 
The President also said that our 
NATO allies: 
Every one of them knew and agreed with 
the decision I made to end, jointly end, our 
involvement in Afghanistan. 
That is not true. That is not true. 
Then the President and his advisers— 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Pol-
icy most recently—have been high-
lighting this incredible, over-the-hori-
zon capability to go after terrorists 
whom we still have in Afghanistan. 
That, we know, has been greatly dimin-
ished. We have heard that from the 
military 
leaders 
who 
know 
these 
issues. So even on that issue, they are 
not leveling with the American people. 
These 
are 
not 
small, 
marginal 
misstatements I am talking about; 
these are dramatic, obvious falsehoods 
that go to the very heart of the foreign 
policy fiasco we have all witnessed. 
These are life-and-death deceptions 
that the President of the United States 
told the American people and he told 
the world. 
Here is the thing: The American peo-
ple, the people in Britain, the people in 
our NATO ally countries, the leaders in 
countries that are adversaries—every-
body knows that these statements were 
false. 
One of the many things that are so 
harmful to come out of this, because of 
these kinds of statements—when they 
come from the Commander in Chief, 
this undermines the credibility and 
honor of the United States of America 
in front of the rest of the world. That 
is one of the major reasons why so 
many of my fellow Alaskans and our 
fellow Americans are so upset by this 
Biden debacle. 
There are going to be more hearings 
next week in the Armed Services Com-
mittee. We are finally going to have 
open hearings. What we will need are 
straight, truthful answers from the 
witnesses, particularly those in uni-
form, who are not obligated to cover 
for the Commander in Chief’s unwise 
decisions or blatant falsehoods. To the 
contrary, these witnesses will need to 
tell the truth—will need to tell the 
truth. 
Speaking of the truth, Mr. President, 
here is one truth that, to me, has been 
clear for months, and I have been talk-
ing about it for months, and it is even 
more relevant and urgent today in 
light of this foreign policy fiasco in Af-
ghanistan. The Biden administration’s 
budget is dangerous to America. 
Take a look at it, America. This is a 
$6 trillion budget—$6 trillion budget— 
where almost every Federal Agency in 
the U.S. Government gets a big in-
crease in its budget; some 40 percent, 20 
percent; all this green; double digits for 
most. Two Agencies—two Agencies—in 
this Biden budget blowout actually get 
cuts. Adjusted for inflation, they are 
cuts. Which are they? The Department 
of Defense and the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
If you are looking at the border right 
now, you know that Homeland Secu-
rity doesn’t need a budget cut, and we 
certainly, in this time of increasing 
danger globally, don’t need the Depart-
ment of Defense cut, but that is what 
this administration is doing right now. 
Like the President’s actions and 
statements on Afghanistan, this budget 
is divorced from reality because here is 
the reality: We have a growing threat 
from 
international 
terrorism 
once 
again as Afghanistan once again has 
become a safe haven for some of the 
most dangerous, violent, extremist or-
ganizations on the planet. We know it. 
We see it. The Taliban, the Haqqani 
network, ISIS-K, al-Qaida—they are all 
celebrating, and they are all coming 
back to Afghanistan, and guess what 
they are doing. They are plotting 
against this great country. It didn’t 
have to be this way, but that is the re-
ality. 
Here is another reality: After watch-
ing this administration’s chaotic with-
drawal from Afghanistan, our adver-
saries are going to test Joe Biden’s will 
in other areas of the world. It is going 
to 
happen—Russia 
with 
regard 
to 
Ukraine or the Baltics or Poland; Iran 
with regard to Israel, which the ter-
rorist leaders in that country continue 
to say they want to wipe off the face of 
the Earth; and, of course, communist 
China, with Taiwan. As some of you 
may have seen, during the Biden Af-
ghanistan debacle, China started rat-
tling its saber as it relates to Taiwan 
for this very reason. 
Let me underscore this again. The 
weakness and lack of resolve dem-
onstrated by the Biden administration 
in Afghanistan and this very weak 
military budget is likely, I think—very 
likely, unfortunately—to invite aggres-
sion by our adversaries in other parts 
of the world. 
Here is my message to the President 
and his team: You better be ready for 
this. You better be strong. And being 
strong starts with supporting a Depart-
ment of Defense budget that is not cut-
ting our readiness, as this one clearly 
does, and actually matches the reali-
ties of the more dangerous world we 
now find ourselves in because of this 
President’s 
foreign 
policy 
incom-
petence. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Mr. 
President, 
8 
months into the humanitarian crisis at 
the southern border, our Democratic 
colleagues are finally, finally paying 
attention. This is after 1.2 million mi-
grants have arrived since President 
Biden took office, which apparently did 
not raise any particular alarms. Nei-
ther did the countless numbers of mi-
grants who endured abuse at the hands 
of criminal organizations and human 
smugglers. 
Our colleagues didn’t spring into ac-
tion either when the processing center 
in Donna, TX, reached 1,600 percent ca-
pacity earlier this year, and they 
didn’t show much concern about the 
fact that the surge had left huge secu-
rity gaps along our border, making it 
easier for the drug cartels to move 
heaven knows what into our country. 
Actually, we do know what they moved 
into the country because more than 
90,000 Americans died of drug overdoses 
last year, principally from illegal drugs 
imported across the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der. 
Finally, our Democratic colleagues 
seem to be paying some attention. 
Over the last several days, more than 
15,000 migrants, primarily Haitians, 
have arrived at Del Rio, TX, a town of 
about 35,000 people—15,000 migrants in 
a town of 35,000. You can imagine what 
sort of reaction they have had. These 
migrants have set up camp under the 
International Bridge, and Border Pa-
trol, State, and local officials have 
been working around the clock to ease 
the humanitarian crisis. Of course, the 
first concern in 100-degree tempera-
tures is to try to help protect these mi-
grants, making sure they have food and 
water and that people don’t die of heat 
stroke. 
I want to thank the Border Patrol, 
which does a lot of good work, and a 
lot of the good work it does is to save 
the lives of migrants who are suffering 
from exposure or injury and have been 
left behind by the coyotes, but it is 
also the law enforcement arm of the 
Federal Government to secure the bor-
der. 
So the Border Patrol, local, and 
State law enforcement and everyone 
seem to come together to meet the 
surge of migrants in Del Rio, but like 
the frontlines of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, these men and women have been 
operating in crisis mode for months 
and are expected to carry the weight of 
a crisis that everybody knew was com-
ing. 
As the Biden administration races to 
respond to the crisis now, finally, I am 
left wondering: Why didn’t they see 
this coming? After all, 1.2 million mi-
grants have crossed our border just

September 23, 2021 
since Joe Biden put his hand on the 
Bible and took the oath of office on 
January 20. The President campaigned, 
actually, on the promises of policies 
that were certain to lead to a surge of 
migrants at the border, and that is just 
what we have seen. 
When the President and Director 
Mayorkas and Vice President HARRIS 
say, ‘‘Don’t come,’’ the migrants see 
people pouring across the border in the 
hundreds of thousands and successfully 
making their way into the interior of 
the United States. The human smug-
glers—the criminal organizations that 
move 
migrants 
from 
their 
homes 
across the border—are getting rich. 
They are whispering in the ear of the 
migrants and saying: These people 
made it. You can make it too. Just 
give me my money. 
Earlier this year, a woman who 
crossed the Rio Grande on a smuggler’s 
raft said the Biden administration was 
the reason that she and her 1-year-old 
son attempted the dangerous journey 
at all. 
She said: ‘‘That gave us the oppor-
tunity to come.’’ 
Some of the closest followers of the 
President’s words and the administra-
tion’s actions are the cartels and 
criminal organizations that get rich off 
of the backs of these migrants. Actu-
ally, it is pretty good money. Let’s say, 
on average, these migrants and their 
families pay $5,000. It varies depending 
upon where you want to come from. If 
you want to come from a little farther 
away, it is a little more expensive. If 
you are a little closer to the border, it 
is a little cheaper. But let’s say, on av-
erage, it is $5,000. If you multiply 1.2 
million migrants times $5,000, that is a 
huge windfall to these criminal organi-
zations. It is good business. It is a 
great business model. 
But migrants suffer at the hands of 
these cartels and human smugglers. 
They often arrive malnourished and 
are suffering from exposure. Many 
young women and girls have been sexu-
ally assaulted. Some of these young 
girls even arrive pregnant. There are 
hundreds of young women who are in 
Del Rio, under the bridge, who are now 
pregnant. And some of them don’t 
make it at all. 
In Brooks County, TX, which is 
where Falfurrias is—it is an interior 
checkpoint by the Border Patrol—the 
practice of the smugglers, the coyotes, 
is to get people across the river, put 
them in a stash house, which you have 
probably seen some pictures of, and 
then, when the coast is clear, put them 
in a truck or some vehicle and drive 
them up the road, past the checkpoint. 
Before they get to the checkpoint, they 
say to the migrants: Get out of the car. 
Here is a gallon milk jug we have filled 
full of water. Here are some protein 
bars. We will meet you on the other 
side of the checkpoint. 
Now, 
some 
of 
the 
land 
around 
Falfurrias, where these checkpoints are 
located, is some of the most difficult 
territory you can possibly imagine, es-
pecially during the summer. Actually, 
the Vice President, when she was in 
the Senate—KAMALA
HARRIS—and I 
sponsored a bill to reimburse Brooks 
County, TX, for burying the bodies of 
unidentified migrants who died while 
trying to make that trip around the 
checkpoint in Falfurrias. They cer-
tainly couldn’t afford it as they have a 
very modest tax base. 
The cartels are always looking for a 
business opportunity and an oppor-
tunity to make a sales pitch to very re-
ceptive ears. When they see the Biden 
administration releasing migrants into 
the interior, they use that information 
to convince others to spend the money 
it takes to make the dangerous journey 
north and, certainly, when the Biden 
administration 
releases 
people 
and 
tells them: ‘‘Come back later for a 
court hearing’’ or ‘‘Here is a Notice to 
Report. When you get to where you are 
going, turn yourself in to ICE, Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement.’’ Of 
course, it should be no surprise that 
many, many, many do not show up; 
they do not report; and they are never 
heard from again unless they commit a 
serious crime. Then it is discovered 
that they have illegally entered the 
United States and have failed to show 
up for their court hearings. 
The point is, once these people make 
it into the United States, you had bet-
ter believe they are on the phone—with 
text messages, emails—talking to their 
relatives back in their home countries. 
And what do they tell them? They say: 
I made it. I made it, and you can too. 
So they keep coming. 
Well, as I said, this is big business for 
the cartels. They get rich off of the mi-
grants, of course. 
Second, when they flood the border 
with all of these migrants—these huge 
numbers—it overwhelms the Border 
Patrol just with unaccompanied chil-
dren alone. In the Rio Grande Valley 
Sector, the Border Patrol Chief said he 
has had to take as many as 40 percent 
of the Border Patrol off of the border 
just to take care of and to process 
these unaccompanied children. 
And what do the cartels do? Well, 
they are not stupid. They are actually 
pretty smart, and they know, when the 
Border Patrol is not guarding the bor-
der, that this is a tremendous oppor-
tunity to move their illegal drugs 
across the border into the United 
States. This isn’t just some conspiracy 
theory; this is a tried and true tactic of 
the narcos. 
Earlier this week, the administration 
admitted to congressional staff that 
this was a coordinated effort by the 
cartels to direct Haitian migrants to a 
single location and overwhelm the Cus-
toms and Border Protection. In other 
words, this entire surge was orches-
trated by a bunch of criminals. They 
intentionally flooded one section of the 
border so that personnel from others 
would be moved. In fact, there were 400, 
I believe, that Chief Ortiz said he 
moved from other sectors of the Border 
Patrol to come to Del Rio to deal with 
this humanitarian crisis. You had bet-
ter believe the cartels took advantage 
of the fact that they left holes in our 
security along the border in order to 
apply their poison and move more mi-
grants across the border. 
Even though we are familiar with the 
tactic and we have seen it time and 
again, the administration still removed 
agents from checkpoints in the Del Rio 
sector to respond to the migrant surge, 
playing right into the hands of the car-
tels when they took agents off the 
frontline. The cartels are simply play-
ing a game. Well, actually, they are 
playing three-dimensional chess while 
the Biden administration is playing 
checkers, and the cartels are con-
tinuing to get rich off of this traf-
ficking in human beings and drugs. It 
is no surprise this shifting of resources 
is simply not sustainable. The adminis-
tration continues to play Whac-A-Mole 
on the southern border. Every time 
progress is made on one crisis, another 
one pops up. 
The administration says they are 
trying to control the crisis in Del Rio, 
and there were early statements that 
they would make use of title 42—a pub-
lic health title—that gives the Border 
Patrol the authority to expel migrants 
based on concerns about spreading 
COVID–19 because these migrants are 
not tested; they are not vaccinated. 
Yet they are put on buses and sent off 
into the interior of the United States 
to contribute to the ongoing pandemic. 
The administration does have tools. 
Title 42 would have given them the au-
thority to turn back the migrants, at 
least the adults, but now, with reports 
that the administration continues to 
release 
migrants 
into 
the 
United 
States, this backsliding will cause this 
situation to repeat itself. Maybe the 
next surge won’t be in Del Rio. Maybe 
it will be in the Rio Grande Valley or 
El Paso or any other sector along the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
My State has 1,200 miles of common 
border with Mexico. There are 2,000 
miles of common border with the 
United States and Mexico. So my State 
is feeling the disproportionate negative 
impact on our border communities, and 
they need help. Without a clear, con-
sistent, and effective approach across 
the entire border, Del Rio will become 
the new normal. 
There are a lot of questions we need 
to ask the administration, and I am 
glad that Chairman DURBIN announced 
that we will have an oversight hearing 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity in the coming weeks. In par-
ticular, I want to know what the ad-
ministration is doing with these 15,000 
individuals once they are processed by 
Border Patrol. 
When Mr. Mayorkas says the process 
is working, does that mean he is taking 
these migrants and placing them into 
the interior of the United States, con-
trary to the earlier statements that 
they were going to transport these mi-
grants by airplane back to Haiti? 
I would like to know how many of 
these migrants are being returned

under title 42. How many of them are 
family units? How many have been re-
leased with a Notice to Report—this 
‘‘turn yourself in to ICE’’ idea? How 
many of these individuals never report 
to ICE to commence their immigration 
court proceedings? 
Most importantly, is the DHS fol-
lowing through on their stated intent 
to expel or remove these individuals? 
That would be real deterrence. That 
would discourage more people from 
coming. 
But, if we find out that the adminis-
tration and the Secretary have been 
lying to us—that instead of expelling 
these individuals they have been plac-
ing them into the interior of the 
United States, using this flawed catch- 
and-release approach—that is a serious 
problem. Transparency is key, and I 
hope we will have an opportunity to 
ask these questions under oath in the 
coming weeks. 
I would also like to know if the ad-
ministration plans to appeal Judge 
Sullivan’s ruling on the use of title 42. 
There is only about another week left 
before Judge Sullivan’s order saying 
that title 42 is no longer available 
kicks in. 
It is important, especially while the 
pandemic is still upon us, that public 
health officials have this authority of 
title 42, because if title 42 isn’t avail-
able, the Border Patrol tells me they 
fear they will lose control entirely. 
Title 42 has been important during 
the pandemic, and, as we know, the 
pandemic is not over. 
Unless Judge Sullivan’s order is ap-
pealed and reversed, the U.S. Govern-
ment will not be able to use this to 
expel most of the migrants, and there 
is no reason to believe that many peo-
ple—particularly the cartels and others 
that benefit from illegal immigration— 
won’t try to ride off of Judge Sullivan’s 
most recent decision and obtain an in-
junction against the use of title 42. 
Without title 42, we will once again 
face overcrowded processing centers 
and even greater humanitarian crises. 
Unfortunately, the migrant surge is 
only a piece of the crisis in Del Rio. 
Those who depend on the ports of entry 
and the bridges at our U.S. inter-
national border are dying for lack of 
economic lifeline that that represents. 
And so the Biden administration has 
been closing these ports of entry with-
out regard for the impact on these bor-
der communities. President Biden can’t 
put the ‘‘Open the Border’’ sign out for 
illegal immigration, yet close the bor-
der for legitimate trade and travel. It 
defies common sense, and it is fun-
damentally unfair. 
Well, there is so much more we could 
say, but the Biden administration can’t 
continue to enable these cartels or 
send signals to migrants encouraging 
them to come. This growing crisis isn’t 
fair to law enforcement and it isn’t fair 
to our border communities and it is not 
fair to the migrants. 
We need a clear strategy from the ad-
ministration that leads to results and 
stops the humanitarian crisis on our 
own border. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
make a statement prior to the vote 
that is pending and that my full state-
ment be allowed to be made prior to 
that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, you 
know, we are here at this—normally, 
Thursday night we wouldn’t be here 
under normal circumstances, but we 
are here because one Member of the 
Senate has determined to impede the 
entire national security infrastructure 
as it relates to the foreign policy of the 
United States. 
What we do in the State Department 
and that which comes through the 
Committee on Foreign Relations has to 
do with the essential security of the 
United States. It is the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee that has jurisdic-
tion over global arms sales. It is the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
that has jurisdiction over the use of 
force. It is the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee that deals with trea-
ties across the globe. It is the Senate 
Foreign 
Relations 
Committee 
that 
deals with the question of nuclear arms 
and proliferation and so much more. 
And it is the State Department that 
perpetuates the national interests and 
security of the United States in its po-
sitions across the globe, both at home, 
in the first place, but across the globe. 
Now, I have had plenty, over the 
course of 30 years of doing foreign pol-
icy work between the House and the 
Senate, and 16 years in the Senate— 
plenty of moments where I had a fun-
damental disagreement, a very strong 
one, with an administration about 
their policy, but I did not hold up the 
entire national security infrastructure 
of the State Department that puts at 
risk the Nation. 
I hear all these speeches about secu-
rity. You are putting at risk the Na-
tion. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had some 
of the critical people—I just heard my 
colleague from Texas—in a position, 
beyond the Department of Homeland 
Security, to deal with the hemispheric 
challenges that we have on immigra-
tion in Central America, in Latin 
America? 
The Haitians who are at the border 
today didn’t just come from the earth-
quake and disasters and assassination 
and hurricanes that have taken place. 
They have been in Latin America for 
quite some time. They have just made 
their way to the border. Wouldn’t it be 
nice if we had the people in place to 
deal—Ambassadors and others—to deal 
in those countries to find a way for-
ward on how we humanely deal with 
that challenge? 
Wouldn’t it be nice if we had the per-
son in charge of East Asia and the Pa-
cific to deal with our challenges with 
China? This Senate came together a 
few months ago and said China is the 
single most significant national secu-
rity challenge, the most significant 
strategic challenge we have in the 
world. And yet we have vacancies ga-
lore to deal with that very challenge. 
I have Members who come to me and 
say: This company from my State is 
having 
problems 
with 
XYZ. 
Well, 
wouldn’t it be nice to be able to have 
an ambassador in that country to deal 
with the challenges of that American 
company or people who come to me and 
talk to me about their challenges in 
getting a loved one, somebody from 
their State, to be able to come? Our 
consular officers. Wouldn’t it be nice to 
have somebody in the position to deal 
with that? 
Wouldn’t it be critical, as we deal 
with the questions of law enforcement 
and drug trafficking, to have the head 
of that, the Assistant Secretary, in po-
sition so that we could deal with those 
challenges? 
So whatever view our colleague from 
Texas has about Nord Stream, and I 
happen to believe that on the sub-
stance he is right, but this procedure is 
wretchedly wrong because it puts us at 
risk in so, so many dimensions. And 
something will happen—something will 
happen somewhere in the world where 
we are not present because one Senator 
decided to hold up that nominee that 
would have made a difference. 
We already saw it. We already saw it 
as we were trying to deal with chal-
lenges in our hemisphere and those 
that related to Afghanistan. Ridicu-
lous. 
So our colleague who is holding this 
all up—because these nominees over-
whelmingly passed the Senate Foreign 
Relations 
Committee 
either 
unani-
mously—hear 
me—unanimously 
or 
with strong bipartisan votes. We just 
saw the cloture vote before—77. 
We are leaving these positions un-
filled. The position is untenable to con-
tinue to be able to meet the challenges 
the State Department has in fulfilling 
whose interest? The interests of the 
American people across the globe. 
So it is time to get over that. We 
have only passed in this body two— 
two—of President Biden’s ambassa-
dorial appointments—two. This admin-
istration has been in office 9 months. 
If I were to look at the same time pe-
riod with President Trump, we did far 
better. I didn’t agree with President 
Trump on a whole host of foreign pol-
icy decisions, but I understood that 
having people in place was critical, 
even when I disagreed with them philo-
sophically. It was critical to promote 
the national interests and security of 
the United States. 
So it is time to get over this. These 
positions 
would 
normally 
pass 
by 
voice, much less taking hours—hours, 
of which, by the way, the debate is not 
even about the nominees or their posi-
tions. It is about immigration and this 
and that and the other. The debate is 
not even about these critical national 
security positions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6654 
September 23, 2021 
I don’t want to hear about people 
coming to the floor and talking about 
national security when they are leav-
ing all these positions vacant. 
Now, let me specifically address the 
nominees that we are voting on. I want 
to express my support for the nomina-
tions of Daniel Kritenbrink to be the 
Assistant Secretary of State for East 
Asia and the Pacific. Whoa. China. 
Karen Donfried to be the Assistant 
Secretary of State for Europe and Eur-
asian Affairs. Oh, we are trying to have 
a strong transatlantic alliance. We are 
talking about Ukraine, Belarus. 
Monica Medina to be the Assistant 
Secretary of State for Oceans and 
International Environmental and Sci-
entific 
Affairs—Scientific 
Affairs. 
Yeah, COVID. 
Mary Catherine Phee to be the As-
sistant Secretary of State for African 
Affairs. We are having a huge chal-
lenge. I have been privileged to meet 
two of the African Presidents here in 
the last couple of days since they are 
here for U.N. Week. China is all over 
Africa. We need an Assistant Secretary 
who is engaged in the continent of Af-
rica to be promoting the views of 
America’s democracy, human rights, 
rule of law, investment, trade, and op-
portunity. We are nowhere there. 
Todd Robinson to be the Assistant 
Secretary of State for International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement. You 
know, I hear speeches about fentanyl; I 
agree. Wouldn’t it be nice to have the 
Assistant Secretary of State to work 
hemispherically and beyond to make 
sure that we don’t get more fentanyl 
into our country? 
And Jessica Lewis to be the Assist-
ant Secretary of State for Political- 
Military Affairs. If ever we needed 
someone who is engaged on the conduct 
of political and military affairs and 
how that faces national security chal-
lenges, it is now. 
These are the people we are voting 
on. These are the people who over-
whelmingly came out of the committee 
on either unanimous or bipartisan 
votes. These are superbly qualified 
nominees, and I have, if it is not obvi-
ous, a very deep frustration about 
them languishing on the floor for 
weeks—weeks—due 
to 
Republican 
holds. And I have a frustration that we 
have not been able to more precipi-
tously move people to the committee 
to bring them to the floor. 
We have close to 100 nominations for 
the State Department and USAID that 
are pending. That is a crisis number. 
These nominations include positions 
and 
ambassadorships 
to 
countries 
throughout Latin America and Africa: 
places where competition with China 
and Russia is real, where we need Am-
bassadors in place to project U.S. 
power, to assist and protect U.S. citi-
zens, and to promote our companies. 
We are less safe when our national 
security 
Agencies 
are 
so 
underwhelmed. We owe it to the Senate 
and the American people to fix this 
problem. 
I am pleased to be supporting the 
nomination 
of 
Ambassador 
Daniel 
Kritenbrink to be Assistant Secretary 
of State for East Asia and Pacific Af-
fairs. In recent years, and on a bipar-
tisan basis, the United States has reas-
sessed and rebalanced our approach to 
the Indo-Pacific to take into account 
the reality of our competitive relation-
ship with China. So this is a region 
rich with pressing challenges from 
North Korea’s nuclear and missile pro-
grams to a rollback in human rights 
and democracy across the region. 
Ambassador Kritenbrink will be able 
to draw from decades of experience in 
the region to lead our efforts in this 
area. 
Also pleased to be supporting Dr. 
Karen Donfried’s nomination, which is 
a testament to the Biden administra-
tion’s effort to rebuild the trans-
atlantic relationship, which was sig-
nificantly damaged by the last admin-
istration. 
I know that Dr. Donfried’s knowledge 
and experience—including previously 
as the Senior Director for European Af-
fairs at the National Security Coun-
cil—will serve the country well as we 
seek to renew that transatlantic rela-
tionship. 
These are issues dealing with Russia, 
Turkey, 
Belarus, 
our 
support 
for 
Ukraine. I hear all the time in speeches 
about support for these countries. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to have the per-
son—forget about nice. Isn’t it critical 
to have the person that can be pro-
moting that view? 
There is Monica Medina to be the As-
sistant Secretary for Oceans and Inter-
national Environmental and Scientific 
Affairs. I am convinced that she is emi-
nently qualified, including the time 
she spent as Principal Deputy Under 
Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere at 
the Department of Commerce and in a 
broad variety of leadership roles fo-
cused on ocean conservation, environ-
mental policy, and science. 
Likewise, I am pleased to support 
Ambassador Mary Catherine Phee to be 
the Assistant Secretary of State for Af-
rican Affairs. As I said, we have an 
enormous challenge on the African 
continent. 
I support Todd Robinson to be a lead-
er as the Assistant Secretary of State 
for the Bureau of International Nar-
cotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. If 
we want to deal with the coyotes whom 
my colleague was talking about, let’s 
put somebody in a position to go after 
them. I know this work is critical to 
our international efforts to combat 
narcotics, to deal with fentanyl, and to 
deal with the trafficking routes that 
extend through Mexico and all the way 
back to China. 
Then there is Jessica Lewis, finally. 
It is with a mixture of deep pride and 
some sorrow that this body will con-
sider the nomination of Ms. Lewis to be 
the next Assistant Secretary of State 
for the Bureau of Political-Military Af-
fairs. 
Almost 20 years ago, I hired Jessica 
for her first job on Capitol Hill as my 
foreign policy adviser and staff direc-
tor of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee’s 
Western 
Hemisphere 
Sub-
committee, of which I was ranking 
member. After moving to the Senate 
and working for Senator Harry Reid for 
nearly a decade, she took up the staff 
director position of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. Throughout her ten-
ure in all of these positions, Members, 
Senators, and staff on both sides of the 
aisle benefited from her deep knowl-
edge of foreign policy, her leadership, 
and indeed her love for Congress itself, 
with all its nuanced rules and proce-
dures. 
Jessica is recognized across party 
lines as one of the most effective and 
trusted leaders on Capitol Hill. She is a 
trailblazer for women in national secu-
rity. When approved by the Senate— 
and I have no doubt she will be—she 
will be the first woman confirmed to 
hold this position. 
It would be impossible to catalogue 
all of her accomplishments, from get-
ting countless bills passed through the 
committee and into law, supporting ef-
forts to conduct serious oversight of 
the executive branch regardless of 
which party is in power, to striving to 
build a truly diverse staff of the For-
eign Relations Committee. I have no 
doubt she will bring her commitment 
to mentorship, integrity, and public 
service to the State Department as 
well. 
So we expect to see her, after she 
gets confirmed, back here answering 
questions and being part of this incred-
ibly important job that she will be 
doing in bringing political and military 
affairs together. 
I hope that we do not have to go 
through these 100 nominees, through 2- 
hour sessions of each nominee, in order 
to get them to start working for U.S. 
national security. That is what is at 
stake here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
COLLIERVILLE SHOOTING 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, as 
I come to the floor today, I want to ac-
knowledge that we have an active 
shooter situation in Collierville, TN, 
right outside of Memphis. We have spo-
ken with authorities. We have worked 
with State and Federal authorities. We 
are aware that there are 13 individuals 
who have been shot. The shooter is 
dead. But we are very grateful for law 
enforcement that have stepped up in 
this situation and prayerful for those 
who have been adversely impacted and 
have been victims of this shooting situ-
ation. 
Mr. President, I ask that I have per-
mission to complete my remarks be-
fore the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this week, we have heard from many of 
my Democratic colleagues about the 
various ways that Republicans have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6655 
September 23, 2021 
supposedly dragged this country to the 
brink of collapse. But what they have 
ignored in their manufactured hysteria 
and disgust in some part is the fact 
that it is, indeed, Democrats who have 
control of the entire U.S. Government 
at this point. It was the Democrats 
who chose to govern alone starting on 
day one of the Biden administration. 
Over the past 8 months, Joe Biden 
and his Democratic friends have in-
dulged their worst instincts and taken 
unprecedented steps to bring every sin-
gle aspect of American life under the 
control of the Federal Government. 
They are the ones who are now 
threatening the American people with 
shutdowns and default rather than 
using the tools at their disposal to 
raise the debt ceiling and fund the gov-
ernment. 
They are the ones who chose to 
squander the trust of the American 
people on a spending spree that would 
waste trillions of dollars on liberal pet 
projects and a rapidly expanding wel-
fare state. The Democrats have repeat-
edly claimed that these programs will 
make us happier, healthier, wealthier, 
freer, but in reality, their agenda has 
done nothing but make things worse. 
Historic spending has given rise to 
historic inflation that is on track to 
stay with us until the end of Joe 
Biden’s Presidency. In Tennessee, it is 
one of the things that I hear about 
most. Groceries are more expensive 
than ever. Gas prices are at a 7-year 
high. Rent has skyrocketed, along with 
natural gas prices, which are set to 
break a decade-old record just in time 
for colder weather to set in. It is bad 
for hard-working taxpayers. They are 
tired of it. 
According to the Wall Street Jour-
nal, not even a well-earned hourly raise 
will be enough to pull these workers 
out of the hole. Inflation is so bad, it 
has negated the budget padding these 
people should be enjoying from bigger 
paychecks. Pay adjusted for inflation 
actually fell. It fell half a percent in 
August. These aren’t luxuries. The 
policies advocated by the Democrats 
have made life itself too expensive to 
afford. From the second they wake up 
in the morning to the moment their 
head hits their pillow at night, the 
American people are bleeding cash, 
paying higher taxes, and some are be-
ginning to lose hope. 
Still, the Democrats insist that if we 
surrender even more control, all will be 
well. Well, that talking point might 
work when you are talking to the cam-
era, but it is not going to work on the 
people. It is not working on Ten-
nesseans because they understand that 
ceding 
control 
means 
surrendering 
freedom, and freedom is about all that 
we have left. 
When I talk to Tennesseans, they are 
not holding back how they feel about 
this so-called transformative agenda. 
For them, this isn’t just a battle of 
ideas. They are fighting a war against 
the onslaught of radical socialism. 
They are afraid of Joe Biden’s runaway 
White House because they have seen 
how destructive the administration’s 
unilateral decisions can be. They have 
watched thousands of jobs evaporate 
and the southern border turned into a 
lawless war zone because the President 
wanted it this way. 
So here is what Tennesseans want to 
know. If they can’t trust the Demo-
crats to do the bare minimum, why 
should they trust that even more 
spending and more centralized control 
and more big government will work out 
in their favor? They have had 8 
months’ worth of proof that the exact 
opposite is true. 
This country might be hanging on by 
a thread. For my part, I will listen to 
my fellow Tennesseans and will play no 
role in facilitating the erosion of free-
dom and the dignity of American life. 
I implore my colleagues in the ma-
jority: Listen to the people. They have 
the right to live their lives on their 
own terms, not with lockdowns and 
mandates—on their terms. They don’t 
want have to depend on a government 
check to feed themselves or get their 
children back to school. 
There is a reason that our Constitu-
tion is one of the enumerated Federal 
powers. It is not the place of Congress 
or the Executive to flip this concept on 
its head and force the American people 
to justify their right to live free from 
this destructive cycle of debt and de-
pendency. Our rights come from God, 
and I assure you, no government body 
could ever improve upon them. 
I yield the floor.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the 
United States has suffered a grave hu-
miliation in Afghanistan. President 
Biden’s 
disastrous 
withdrawal 
has 
brought shame to a nation that fought, 
bled, and sacrificed for two long dec-
ades after September 11. 
Defeat can be imposed by an enemy, 
but humiliation is self-inflicted. In this 
case, it was inflicted on America by the 
President of the United States. 
To the thousands of Americans who 
fought bravely in Afghanistan, I share 
your dismay, and I want to tell you 
this was not your fault. This failure 
was not caused by our exceptional 
troops, who fought with courage and 
skill against a determined and ruthless 
enemy. Our warriors lost no battles 
and surrendered to no enemy. They 
fought from the highest summits of 
American 
armed 
conflict 
and 
de-
scended under the darkest pits of evil. 
Our men and women in uniform made 
us proud and filled us with awe. This 
loss is not their loss. 
The debacle in Afghanistan was also 
not the fault of our people. The Amer-
ican people contributed hundreds of 
billions of dollars to a just cause and 
endured a prolonged conflict for almost 
a generation. 
No, our people and our warriors did 
not fail. Our leaders did, and none 
failed more conspicuously than a Com-
mander in Chief who could not com-
mand events. 
Joe Biden has been paving the path 
to ruin for over a decade. Many have 
been wrong about the war in Afghani-
stan, but few have been more wrong, 
more consistently than this President. 
During the Obama administration, 
Joe Biden wrongly argued that Amer-
ica could strike terrorists from over 
the horizon, wrongly set a public 
timeline for withdrawing our troops, 
and wrongly opposed a secret mission 
to kill Osama Bin Laden. Then he 
stood by when President Obama re-
leased several high-value Taliban offi-
cials from Guantanamo Bay in ex-
change for an American traitor, Bowe 
Bergdahl. 
Joe Biden extended his perfect record 
of terrible judgment. He was wrong 
about evacuating Bagram Air Base, 
wrong about the likelihood that the 
Taliban would take over Afghanistan, 
and wrong that the Taliban cared 
about its international reputation. 
He also believed wrongly—incred-
ibly—that we could trust the Taliban 
to secure the Kabul airport and help us 
evacuate our people. 
The President’s inexhaustible inepti-
tude has created this fiasco. According 
to official estimates, over 100 Ameri-
cans and thousands of green card hold-
ers are currently stranded in a country 
run by terrorists. The much-vaunted 
airlift that the President pretends is an 
‘‘extraordinary 
success’’—in 
his 
words—evacuated fewer than half of 
approved special immigrant visa hold-
ers. That includes thousands of Af-
ghans who fought loyally alongside our 
troops and have now been abandoned to 
torture and execution at the hands of 
the Taliban. 
The allies of al-Qaida now rule in 
Kabul; the Taliban is armed with bil-
lions of dollars of U.S. military equip-
ment; and those Guantanamo Bay de-
tainees released under the Obama ad-
ministration now serve in the highest 
levels of the Afghan Government. 
My office has received many first-
hand reports of Taliban insurgents 
going house to house, hunting for 
American allies. Former Afghan pilots 
are especially high-risk targets who 
are being tracked down and brutally 
murdered; and, of course, we have all 
seen the disturbing videos of desperate 
Afghans clinging to an American trans-
port plane and plummeting to their 
deaths on the tarmac below. 
I will admit I had low expectations 
for Joe Biden’s Presidency, yet he still 
failed to meet them. 
When I served in Afghanistan, I saw 
the Taliban’s grim handiwork up close. 
I witnessed the sacrifices of brave 
Americans and Afghans to prevent 
them from regaining power. So when 
this disaster unfolded, I was deter-
mined to do whatever I could to get our 
people to safety. 
Soon after the fall of Kabul, my of-
fice established an email hotline for 
evacuation requests, created a war 
room to help those in need, and estab-
lished contact with assets on the 
ground. 
Members of my team did everything 
from providing required forms and up- 
to-date information to helping orches-
trate daring midnight evacuations. We 
facilitated the escape of high-ranking 
members of the Afghan Government 
and military, along with wounded chil-
dren and pregnant mothers, several of 
whom were being actively hunted by 
Taliban death squads. 
We also helped dozens of students 
from a Christian missionary school 
reach safety before they suffered the 
cruel treatment that Islamic terrorists 
reserve for so-called apostates, or fol-
lowers, of the gospel. 
My staff worked around the clock, 
volunteering their time and energy 
and, on several occasions, their own re-
sources to help those in need. One aide 
repeatedly drove to Dulles Airport to 
deliver clothes to needy Afghans. An-
other sent school supplies to a recently 
returned second grader. 
All of us heard harrowing stories 
from the ground. A member of my 
team was on the phone with an Amer-
ican citizen as the Taliban thugs at-
tacked her and brutally assaulted her 
driver on their way to the airport. The 
same woman was on the phone with my 
office, outside the Kabul airport, when 
Taliban guards started shooting in the 
air, 
causing 
a 
stampede. 
Luckily, 
thanks to the cooperation of my staff, 
military personnel at the gate were 
able to pull her to safety before she 
was potentially crushed by the stam-
peding mob. 
I would remind the Senate that Joe 
Biden and Tony Blinken empowered 
the men who beat and then almost 
killed an American citizen while a 
member of my office was literally on 
the phone with her. 
The extraordinary efforts of my 
staffs in Washington and Arkansas pro-
duced exceptional results. From the be-
ginning of the crisis to today, we have 
contacted more than 2,500 individuals 
seeking assistance, and we have helped 
more than 300 American citizens and 
legal permanent residents to safely 
evacuate, along with over 200 other 
vulnerable Afghans, many of whom 
were the immediate family of those 
Americans and permanent residents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6657 
September 23, 2021 
I want to thank my staff for their in-
credible and selfless work. I sincerely 
believe that these actions have re-
deemed, in some measure, the honor 
and trust that President Biden squan-
dered this past month. I also want to 
acknowledge the many other aides— 
Democratic and Republican, House and 
Senate—who also pitched in to help our 
fellow citizens. 
But, for every tale of sacrifice, dar-
ing, and courage that ended in a plane 
ride to safety, there were also tales of 
tragedy, heartbreak, and failure. Un-
fortunately, many of the wounds that 
we suffered during the Afghan with-
drawal were, once again, self-inflicted. 
Those of us involved in the rescue ef-
fort had a front-row seat to the Biden 
administration’s ineptitude. I think it 
is worth recounting some of those sto-
ries as well. 
On one notable occasion, my office 
was contacted by a group of three 
American women who had traveled to a 
site that was reportedly being used to 
shuttle people to the airport for evacu-
ation. When they arrived, a group of 
Taliban fighters pointed guns in their 
faces and refused to let them pass. The 
women called a member of my staff for 
help, who promptly called the State 
Department for guidance. 
The State Department’s initial re-
sponse to Americans held at gunpoint 
was to ask whether they had filled out 
an online form to request evacuation. 
When my aide pressed the matter fur-
ther, the State Department told them: 
‘‘Our best advice is not to give advice.’’ 
This casual indifference to the plight 
of American citizens was, regrettably, 
not an isolated incident. 
On a separate occasion, my staff 
learned that a State Department em-
ployee told an American citizen who 
refused to leave Afghanistan without 
her family that she was ‘‘being really 
annoying right now.’’ 
I suppose she was just one more in-
convenient 
American 
spoiling 
Joe 
Biden’s extraordinary success. 
On another occasion, I received a 
phone call from the Ambassador of a 
country in the region. His government 
wanted to know what to do about doz-
ens of American-trained Afghan sol-
diers and their families who had fled to 
his country in order to escape the 
Taliban. The only problem was the Am-
bassador’s government couldn’t get 
any senior official from the White 
House or the State Department to re-
turn their calls, not so much as a 
‘‘thank you’’; ‘‘please hold what you 
have got’’; ‘‘we will be back to help you 
soon.’’ It was radio silence from Amer-
ica while the Taliban continued to de-
mand the return of those troops. 
Thankfully, I was able to work with 
Senator COONS to get the message to 
the administration. After much confu-
sion and delay, the State Department 
official finally returned the Ambas-
sador’s call. I want to thank Senator 
COONS for his assistance. The episode is 
a reminder that this body still works 
and bipartisanship is possible even 
when the stakes are high. 
Even some members of the executive 
branch have acknowledged that the ad-
ministration’s policies have been a ca-
tastrophe. On more than one occasion, 
my staff has received calls from offi-
cials in the government asking for our 
help to evacuate people from Afghani-
stan. In other words, members of the 
executive branch of the most powerful 
Nation on Earth were going to a lone, 
freelancing Senate office for help in-
stead of to their own State Department 
or their own White House. 
President Biden has refused to lead 
and refused to protect those he took an 
oath to protect, so it fell to the rest of 
us to shoulder the load and get these 
Americans 
to 
safety. 
Thankfully, 
Americans remain a generous and cou-
rageous people. We stepped up to meet 
this moment. 
Over the past few weeks, countless 
normal citizens volunteered to help 
people they had never met. Veterans 
reunited for one last mission to help 
their old battle buddies get to safety, 
and, of course, thousands of American 
troops risked their lives to help others 
in a distant land far from home. Thir-
teen of them made the ultimate sac-
rifice on the noble mission to rescue 
their countrymen, who will never for-
get their sacrifice, nor will we. They 
performed bravely a job that they 
never should have had to perform. 
Joe Biden’s Afghanistan crisis will 
live in infamy as one of the worst stra-
tegic blunders in our Nation’s history, 
but the response of so many Americans 
to save their fellow citizens and their 
allies showed the very best of our coun-
try. I am proud that my office was able 
to play some small part in that re-
demptive story. 
Poor leadership comes and goes, but 
our national character endures. Ameri-
cans have shown that we are still capa-
ble of noble and heroic deeds even—and 
maybe especially—when politicians in 
Washington fail in their duty. Our Na-
tion is still exceptional even if our 
President is a mediocrity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we have 
been in session now for about 11 hours, 
and we have taken up a handful of non-
controversial nominees. 
The reason? 
The abuse by the Republicans of the 
rules of the Senate—filibuster after fil-
ibuster that require cloture votes—so 
we spend several hours on each of these 
nominations. 
Even worse, the Republicans have 
abused the rules of the Senate to deny 
us in the Senate the ability to consider 
critical legislation that we should be 
taking up and acting on. There are 
many, many examples. I will just cite a 
few. 
Justice in Policing: We are all com-
mitted to reforming our criminal jus-
tice system and our police system in 
order to deal with the values of our Na-
tion. I know that Senator BOOKER has 
worked tirelessly on this issue. We 
should be able to debate that bill on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, but, no, 
the Republicans will require a cloture 
vote and will not give us the votes even 
to consider that legislation. 
Or consider gun safety, which we 
have been debating in the public now 
for decades, and the Republicans are 
continuing to use the rules of the Sen-
ate to deny the Senate the opportunity 
to take up issues and debate issues and 
see whether we can come together. 
Or take immigration reform, where 
we see the tragedies that are occurring 
where we need to take action as a Sen-
ate, but, no, the Republicans won’t 
give us the votes so we can get on a bill 
and debate issues and take up amend-
ments and see whether we can’t get 
something done on immigration. 
And now they are threatening to use 
the filibuster on the legislation that 
would extend the debt ceiling so that 
we don’t default on our debt in regard 
to moneys that have been spent with 
the initiation and support of our Re-
publican colleagues. They are threat-
ening to deny us the opportunity to 
take up that bill and vote on it by the 
use of the filibuster, even though they 
were the ones who created the spending 
and debt. 
Or take the continuation of our gov-
ernment. 
But top on my list is safeguarding 
our election system, the bedrock of our 
democracy. On two occasions, Senate 
Democrats voted unanimously to sim-
ply begin debate on protecting the 
right to vote in our democracy, which 
has come under sustained assault in 
the aftermath of the 2020 elections. 
Both times, all Senate Republicans 
blocked even beginning the debate on 
this critical legislation. Senate Repub-
licans put gridlock and partisanship 
before the rights of voters. 
The Senate is being blocked from 
having the chance to consider options 
and amendments and do what the 
Founding Fathers intended us to do— 
legislate. 
So my Senate Republican colleagues 
will have another chance to do the 
right thing, thanks to Leader SCHUMER 
and Senator KLOBUCHAR. Over the Au-
gust recess, they worked diligently to 
come up with compromise legislation 
that still preserves the essential ele-
ments of S. 1, the For the People Act, 
that has already passed the House of 
Representatives. 
President Biden was absolutely cor-
rect that we need to enact voting 
rights legislation to repair the damage 
done by the Supreme Court to the Vot-
ing Rights Act. President Biden rightly 
called efforts to limit ballot access 
across the country as the 21st century 
Jim Crow assault. He warned Ameri-
cans that the Republicans’ efforts to 
restrict voting rights as a result of 
their selfish challenge of the 2020 elec-
tion results were the most significant 
tests of our democracy since the Civil 
War. 
Indeed, 
my 
colleagues 
witnessed 
firsthand the violent insurrection at

September 23, 2021 
the Capitol when the mob attacked, in-
jured, and killed our brave Capitol Po-
lice officers, who put their lives on the 
line to preserve our very democracy 
and Union. 
In many States, legislatures and 
Governors have responded to the false-
hoods of the 2020 elections by restrict-
ing voting accessibility. The Big Lie, 
repeated by President Trump, has di-
rectly led to the disenfranchisement 
and suppression of the right to vote for 
millions of Americans. 
I urge my colleagues and my fellow 
American citizens to reflect on the 
state of our democracy and the rights 
we hold dear. A blatant attempt to fal-
sify an election and a persistent effort 
to deny the American people access to 
the ballot box has undermined the free-
dom and liberty that so many Ameri-
cans have fought to defend and ad-
vance. 
Voting rights is a fundamental issue 
of importance to a democratic country. 
After elections are over and we win, we 
celebrate. We celebrate the fact that 
we have gotten the support of the ma-
jority of voters, and that is what de-
mocracy is all about. If we don’t win— 
and I think many of us have been in-
volved in campaigns where our can-
didates were not successful—we go to 
work to try to attract more voters in 
the next election so we can celebrate a 
victory. 
That is what participation in a free 
society is all about. That is what de-
mocracies are about. In repressive, 
autocratic regimes, they never accept 
the will of the people, so they look at 
ways in which they can undermine the 
voting record—what the voters want to 
do and the voters’ will. 
In the 2020 elections, we should all 
celebrate the record number of people 
who cast their ballot. It was a record 
and the most ever Americans casting 
their votes for the Presidency of the 
United States. 
There were repeated reviews done by 
both Democrats and Republicans at the 
Federal, State, and local level. It all 
verified the simple fact that there was 
no widespread corruption or election 
fraud. The will of the people prevailed, 
and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were 
duly elected. 
Congress and Vice President Pence 
counted the electoral votes for Presi-
dent and Vice President and did their 
duty under the Constitution on Janu-
ary 6, notwithstanding the armed in-
surrection in the Capitol. 
But that did not stop former Presi-
dent Trump from promoting the Big 
Lie. As a result of that, several States 
have now taken action to make it 
harder for people to cast their votes. 
The Brennan Center has pointed out 
that we have seen the worst assault on 
voting rights since Jim Crow. 
So what have these laws done? Made 
it more difficult for voters to vote by 
mail, recognizing that for many voters 
they prefer to vote by mail. We have 
States that have had 100 percent voting 
by mail. There have been no indica-
tions of fraud in voting by mail. States 
have shortened the time for requesting 
mail-in ballots for voting, making it 
more difficult for individuals to be able 
to vote by mail, requiring certain re-
quirements to vote by mail, making it 
more difficult to deliver their mail bal-
lots, limiting the availability of ballot 
drop boxes. 
Why did States take these actions? 
Because it makes it more difficult for 
people who are likely to vote for their 
political opponents to vote. That is 
what these State legislatures were 
doing. Stricter signature requirements, 
making in-person voting more dif-
ficult, purging voter rolls simply be-
cause a person did not vote, and, again, 
making it more difficult for people to 
vote. That should have no place in a 
democracy. 
And it goes on and on in terms of the 
types of legislation that have already 
passed or is currently being considered 
by many State legislatures around our 
country. Making it more difficult to 
register to vote, making it more dif-
ficult to vote, targeting potential vot-
ers more likely to vote for their oppo-
nents, targeting minorities, young vot-
ers, and older minority voters is a dis-
turbing trend we see across this coun-
try and has no place in our democracy. 
The Freedom to Vote Act provides a 
basic Federal floor on protection of the 
right to vote. This legislation includes 
commonsense items such as automatic 
and online voter registration, uniform 
early voting, same-day voter registra-
tion, vote-by-mail and drop box stand-
ards and uniform national standards 
for voter identification. 
These are simple voter protection 
measures against the actions being 
taken by State legislatures that are 
aimed at certain demographic groups 
and set a Federal floor. 
The Freedom to Vote Act ends polit-
ical gerrymandering. I don’t know how 
many of my colleagues can defend the 
way that legislative and congressional 
lines are drawn today. Congressional 
districts should represent the commu-
nities’ interests, not an individual Con-
gressman’s interests. 
The Freedom to Vote Act takes a 
major step forward in ending political 
gerrymandering 
by 
creating 
non-
partisan redistricting reform and ban-
ning partisan gerrymandering and al-
lowing States to choose how to develop 
redistricting plans, including having an 
independent redistricting commission. 
In terms of election integrity, the 
Freedom to Vote Act requires voter- 
verified paper ballots, reliable audits, 
and voting system upgrades. I think we 
all would agree that we want to be able 
to verify votes. The only way we can is 
if there is a paper trail, and it provides 
for that paper trail. 
The measure takes steps to prevent 
State election subversion to better in-
sulate State and local officials who ad-
minister Federal elections, after the 
attempts by both domestic and foreign 
interference in the 2020 election re-
sults. 
This legislation reduces the domi-
nance of Big Money in the political 
system. It does this in a couple ways. 
One, disclosure. How can anyone be 
against the disclosure of who is putting 
money into our political system? And, 
secondly, by providing a way in which 
we can weaken the dependence on large 
special interest dollars. 
The legislation requires super PACs, 
501(c)(4) groups, and other organiza-
tions spending money on elections to 
disclose donors and shuts down the use 
of transfers between organizations to 
cloak the identity of contributors. 
It ensures that political ads sold on-
line have the same transparency and 
disclosure requirements as ads sold on 
TV, radio, and satellite. 
S. 2747 includes two provisions I au-
thored. First, it includes the Democ-
racy Restoration Act, which deals with 
laws passed after the end of slavery in 
an effort to prevent African Americans 
from voting. There are States that 
passed laws back then that are still on 
the books that disqualify for a lifetime 
a person convicted of a felony. The def-
inition of a felony is pretty general in 
many States, so we have States where 
one out of five African Americans have 
been disqualified from voting because 
of their conviction of a felony, even 
though they are fully part of our soci-
ety today. They don’t have the right to 
vote. We need to remove that disquali-
fication on voting. 
I am pleased that my Deceptive Prac-
tices and Voter Intimidation Preven-
tion Act is included as a provision in 
the legislation. The spreading of false 
or misleading information intended to 
suppress voting and intimidate the 
electorate remains one of the most reg-
ularly employed and effective methods 
used to keep individuals, particularly 
Black Americans and other racial mi-
norities, from voting. 
Advancement in communications, in-
cluding the rise of social media plat-
forms, have made it easier for bad ac-
tors to use these strategies. For exam-
ple, the targeting of Latino voters in 
Florida with disinformation was widely 
documented. This provision prohibits 
individuals from knowingly deceiving 
others about the time, place, eligi-
bility, or procedures of participating in 
a Federal election. 
It 
criminalizes 
efforts 
to 
inten-
tionally hinder, interfere with, or pre-
vent any person from voting, reg-
istering to vote, or aiding a person to 
vote or register to vote. 
My friend and former colleague was 
the late John Lewis of Georgia. The 
two of us were elected to the House of 
Representatives on the same day. In an 
editorial published after his death, 
Representative Lewis called an impor-
tant lesson taught—recalled an impor-
tant lesson taught by Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. And I quote our former 
colleague when he said: 
Each of us has a moral obligation to stand 
up, speak up, and speak out. When you see 
something that is not right, you must say 
something. You must do something. Democ-
racy is not a state. It is an act. And each 
generation must do its part.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6659 
September 23, 2021 
Well, we cannot take action if we 
don’t start. And we cannot start unless 
my colleagues allow us to proceed to 
this issue on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
I urge my colleagues not to filibuster 
the right of the U.S. Senate to start 
the debate on protecting voter integ-
rity, where each Member will have the 
opportunity to debate the issue and, 
collectively, we can come together. 
Many of my colleagues have offered 
suggestions about how we can further 
improve S. 2747, how we can make it 
even a broader consensus. 
Let’s build on the work done by Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR
and her colleagues 
over the August recess. But we cannot 
do that unless we have the right to pro-
ceed to a debate. 
I urge my colleagues to support tak-
ing up the Freedom to Vote Act, which 
is a critical issue to the preservation of 
our democracy and the integrity of our 
right to vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Texas. 
NORD STREAM 2 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would 
like to discuss now how Nord Stream 2 
is an unprecedented example, a con-
temporary 
example, 
of 
bipartisan 
unity. Democrats and Republicans both 
know that Nord Stream 2 is a terrible 
idea. It is a terrible idea for Europe, 
and it is a terrible idea for the United 
States. 
Here are several examples of the bi-
partisan agreement we have. It has 
been commonplace to say that biparti-
sanship doesn’t exist, but Nord Stream 
2 refutes that. 
The first wave of sanctions authored 
by me and by Senator SHAHEEN goes 
back to the summer of 2019. At a July 
31 hearing, several Democrats spoke 
out against Nord Stream 2 and its sup-
port of the Cruz-Shaheen sanctions to 
stop it. 
Here are some of the things they 
said. Senator MENENDEZ said: 
I think the international community must 
stand firm against opening more doors and 
creating new opportunities for further Krem-
lin aggression in Ukraine leading to the loss 
of life. The Russian Federation has repeat-
edly used its energy resources as a lever of 
power, and I believe Nord Stream 2 is no ex-
ception. 
Not 
only 
will 
it 
considerably 
strengthen the Kremlin’s stranglehold on 
Europe, but it allows Moscow to further un-
dermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and stability. 
Senator SHAHEEN said: 
We have heard in our office directly from 
other countries in Eastern and Central Eu-
rope, and the Baltics, and many of the Nor-
dic states, and of course especially Ukraine, 
who understand that this pipeline is an ef-
fort to increase reliance on Russia among 
Europe. And I would argue that this does 
nothing to strengthen the transatlantic alli-
ance, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In fact, it 
actually decreases support for the alliance. 
Here is what Senator COONS
from 
Delaware said: 
I, like many of us, have been to Ukraine, 
remain gravely concerned about Russia’s on-
going aggression against Ukraine, and the 
ways in which Russia finances its aggression 
through the use of its sole remaining export 
of any interest, which is energy. 
Senator MENENDEZ was right. Sen-
ator SHAHEEN was right. Senator COONS 
was right. That consensus has held for 
over 2 years, Democrats and Repub-
licans, even through the Biden admin-
istration’s catastrophic decision to 
green light the pipeline and to give a 
multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir 
Putin. 
This issue was central to a June 8 
meeting of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee after Biden had defied 
U.S. law and given a multibillion-dol-
lar gift to Putin. 
Here is what Senator MENENDEZ said 
after Biden acted: 
I think many of us on a bipartisan basis 
were deeply concerned about the administra-
tion’s decision to waive sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2 AG. . . . I would have thought that 
one of the most significant ways to show 
strength is to ensure that the pipeline is 
killed. 
Senator MENENDEZ was right. 
Senator MERKLEY
even condemned 
the pipeline for issues he said were di-
rectly related to climate change, which 
is something Biden officials claim is 
utterly sacrosanct in this administra-
tion. 
The consensus, even after the Biden 
administration 
formally 
announced 
that it had struck a deal surrendering 
entirely to Russia on the pipeline— 
nonetheless, we saw the bipartisan con-
sensus remain. 
On July 21, Senator KAINE said: 
I’m not happy about it. . . . I’m not happy 
about it in terms of Russian politics, and I’m 
not happy about it in terms of climate 
change. 
Senator KAINE was right. 
Senator SHAHEEN said she was ‘‘skep-
tical that [the agreement] will be suffi-
cient when the key player at the 
table—Russia—refuses to play by the 
rules.’’ 
Senator SHAHEEN was right. She was 
right to be skeptical that the agree-
ment from the Biden administration, 
mind you, will be sufficient when the 
key player at the table—Russia—re-
fuses to play by the rules. 
And I would note that the consensus 
wasn’t limited to the Senate. On the 
other side of the Capitol in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, that same 
sentiment was broadly echoed both 
during the previous administration and 
during the current administration. 
At the beginning of my push for the 
Cruz-Shaheen sanctions in 2019, Demo-
cratic Representative ENGEL said: 
Russia has weaponized its energy re-
sources, expanding into European markets 
and creating greater and greater dependency, 
particularly with projects such as the Nord 
Stream 2. 
Representative ENGEL was right. 
Several years later, after the an-
nouncement of President Biden’s com-
plete surrender to Russia on Nord 
Stream 2, Representative KAPTUR told 
a Polish newspaper that she and much 
of the House of Representatives were 
disappointed with the deal. She said: 
I am very disappointed by the Biden ad-
ministration’s willingness to allow Russian 
gas to reach the heart of Europe via Nord 
Stream 2, endangering energy security. . . . 
We consider this a dangerous project from a 
security point of view. 
Representative KAPTUR was right. 
Supporters of the Biden administra-
tion will say: Well, of course, every-
body opposes Nord Stream 2, but there 
is no way to stop it. 
That excuse is disingenuous. That ex-
cuse is laughable on its face. Now, why 
is that? Because it is the identical ex-
cuse that was central to the Russian 
disinformation 2 years ago. In the sum-
mer of 2019, when I first authored the 
bipartisan 
sanctions 
to 
stop 
Nord 
Stream 2, the Russian disinformation 
campaign in Europe was predicated on 
the proposition that the pipeline was 95 
percent complete, and they said: Gosh, 
you can’t stop it. There is nothing you 
can do to stop it. 
They halted construction of the pipe-
line 15 minutes before our bipartisan 
sanctions were signed into law, and for 
over a year, the pipeline lay dormant 
as a hunk of metal at the bottom of the 
sea. 
So every time the Biden administra-
tion says ‘‘It was too far along; we 
couldn’t stop it,’’ you know what—it 
was just as far along in December of 
2019, and we stopped it then. It was just 
as far along in January of 2020, and we 
stopped it then. We stopped it in Feb-
ruary. We stopped it in March, April, 
May, June, July, August, September, 
October, November, December. And it 
wasn’t until January, January 24—4 
days after Joe Biden took the oath of 
office—that Russia resumed building 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
The only reason they couldn’t stop it 
is because Joe Biden wanted to sur-
render to Putin, because the answer is, 
Republicans and Democrats in this 
Chamber had stopped it for over a year, 
until Joe Biden came in and turned vic-
tory into defeat; until Joe Biden came 
in and offered complete capitulation— 
and might I note, in exchange for noth-
ing. 
Let me ask you, what did the Biden 
administration get in exchange for a 
multibillion-dollar gift—and not a one- 
time gift; a gift every year for decades 
in perpetuity? What did the Biden ad-
ministration get? Not a damn thing. 
Nothing. It was simply a complete ca-
pitulation. Surrender. 
Now, defenders of the Biden adminis-
tration will say: Well, maybe we could 
have stopped it a few months ago, be-
fore the pipeline was complete. But in 
between January and this month, the 
Russian efforts built the pipeline, and 
they just announced it is complete. So 
now we should surrender, right? There 
is nothing that can be done about it. 
Well, that, in fact, is not true. That 
is a second wave of disinformation. 
Now, why is that true? That is not true 
because before the pipeline can go on-
line, there are a series of certifications 
that are required. Nord Stream 2 AG, 
the company that is responsible for

September 23, 2021 
planning, construction, and eventual 
operation of Nord Stream 2, needs to be 
granted formal permission as a gas 
transmitter. There are many regu-
latory hurdles in their way—hurdles 
that have not yet been cleared. The 
process at a minimum should take 
many months, and the process could be 
derailed at any time. 
First, there has to be an inspection 
process. Each of Nord Stream 2’s 
strings has to be inspected to make 
sure there are no leaks, and part of 
that requires confirming that the pipe-
lines were installed correctly. Part of 
that has already begun with air. No-
body knows how it has been going. 
Then, there has to be an additional 
technical certification. This will be ex-
tremely difficult for Nord Stream 2 AG 
because the bipartisan sanctions legis-
lation that I wrote and passed with 
Senator SHAHEEN
and that Congress 
passed imposes mandatory sanctions 
on anyone who certifies the pipeline for 
operation. 
Now, pause and think about that for 
a second. The pipeline can’t go into ef-
fect unless it is certified. U.S. law 
passed overwhelmingly by Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
in this Congress, 
signed into law in the U.S. Code, says 
anyone who certifies it faces manda-
tory, 
crushing 
sanctions from the 
United States. The company that was 
originally going to certify it withdrew 
after the sanctions became law. The 
only way that a different company 
would dare to certify is if they believed 
the Biden administration would look 
the other way, would bless their cer-
tification in outright defiance of U.S. 
law. 
Then, 
apart 
from 
the 
technical 
issues, Nord Stream 2 AG still has to be 
certified as a gas transmission operator 
as a matter of regulation and law. That 
should take at a minimum many 
months and require delicate negotia-
tions between the company and the 
regulators. 
You know, what is striking is, every-
thing that I am saying has been said by 
the Biden administration. So right 
now, their talking points are ‘‘There is 
nothing we can do. It is a done deal. We 
have surrendered. We have given up. 
There is nothing we can do,’’ but when 
they were in the process of surren-
dering, they said everything I just told 
you. 
Until recently, even the top officials 
of the Biden administration acknowl-
edged that physical completion of Nord 
Stream 2 didn’t make its activation a 
fait accompli. 
On 
June 
8, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Blinken testified that ‘‘even when the 
pipeline is physically complete, for it 
to go into operation, it still requires 
insurance, it still requires various per-
mits, and we are looking very carefully 
at all of that.’’ Secretary Blinken said 
that ‘‘it was too late to stop the join-
ing of those pipes. Its operation is an-
other matter.’’ 
Secretary Blinken was wrong when 
he said it was too late to stop the join-
ing of the pipes because we stopped 
them for over a year, until Biden sur-
rendered to Putin, but he wasn’t wrong 
when he said we could still stop the op-
eration of it. 
Given these requirements and this 
time line, the path for America is obvi-
ous: We should sanction Nord Stream 2 
AG, the parent company of the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. That will automati-
cally isolate the company, and it will 
signal our readiness to follow the law, 
to impose more sanctions, and to en-
sure that everyone knows that involve-
ment with Putin’s pipeline brings with 
it 
crippling, 
company-ending 
sanc-
tions. Indeed, that is exactly why Con-
gress has repeatedly passed legisla-
tion—bipartisan 
legislation—to 
stop 
this pipeline. But instead of obeying 
the law, President Biden decided bra-
zenly and willfully to defy Federal 
law—to defy Congress’s mandate. 
In May, President Biden transmitted 
a communication to Congress that ac-
knowledged, yes, he was obliged to im-
pose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG 
for violating the sanctions that Con-
gress had passed and passed over-
whelmingly, but instead of imposing 
those mandatory sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2 AG, given the clear and un-
equivocal intent of Congress, the Biden 
administration chose instead to waive 
them. It was a disastrous decision. It 
was a decision based on weakness and 
capitulation to Russia. It hurt our 
friends and allies in Europe, and it hurt 
the United States of America. 
It is a decision that can be reversed. 
Right now, the pipeline, if this pipeline 
goes into effect, will be the Biden- 
Putin pipeline. It doesn’t have to be. 
This was designed at the outset to be 
the Putin pipeline, and when it was the 
Putin pipeline, we stopped it. Repub-
licans stopped it. Democrats stopped it. 
We came together at a time of partisan 
division and we said together: Giving 
billions of dollars to Putin, to Russia, 
for aggressive military hostility, sub-
jecting Europe to energy blackmail, 
making Europe dependent on Putin’s 
gas, and destroying American jobs is 
bad all around. 
Congress succeeded. It was the Putin 
pipeline until January 24, 2021. Joe 
Biden had just been sworn into office, 
and Putin, after a year of dormancy, 
began building the pipeline again be-
cause Biden had already signaled he in-
tended to capitulate. 
When we convene next week, I am 
going to discuss in greater detail the 
compromise that I have offered to the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
Senate 
Democrats to move forward on more of 
their nominees if they accept a com-
promise solution on Nord Stream 2. 
The Biden administration has had this 
compromise offer for 2 months, and 
they have done nothing with it. 
But I would suggest something right 
now. In the course of my remarks, I 
have read quote after quote after quote 
from Senate Democrats. Senate Demo-
crats know this pipeline is a disaster 
for America. Senate Democrats know 
that surrendering to Putin is bad for 
America. But Senate Democrats are 
scared to stand up to a Democratic 
President. 
I can tell you, when we had a Repub-
lican 
President, 
President 
Trump, 
there were some in the Trump adminis-
tration who resisted these bipartisan 
sanctions, and as a Republican, I was 
perfectly willing to stand up to a Re-
publican administration for those who 
were resisting these sanctions and to 
press them hard. 
So my request to my Democratic col-
leagues is, show that you actually be-
lieve what you said in 2019 and 2020 and 
2021. Show that you care about U.S. na-
tional security. Let’s stand together, 
and let’s reclaim that bipartisan con-
sensus we have had for 2 years that 
Nord Stream 2 is bad for America and 
bad for our allies. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture 
having been invoked, the clerk will re-
port the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-

District of Columbia, to be an Assist-
ant Secretary of State (European Af-
fairs and Eurasian Affairs). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
NOMINATION OF MONICA P. MEDINA 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I would 
like to speak in support of Ms. Monica 
Medina’s nomination to be Assistant 
Secretary of State for the Bureau of 
Oceans 
and 
International 
Environ-
mental and Scientific Affairs. 
I have known Monica for more than 
30 years and can say without a shred of 
doubt that she is the most qualified 
and competent candidate to fill this 
position. She has worked for decades 
across multiple administrations on 
issues of environmental law and policy. 
She 
understands 
well 
the 
inter-
connected world we live in and knows 
that 21st-century U.S. foreign policy 
goes not simply beyond the water’s 
edge but to the seas and the skies and 
the sands of the world, where universal 
threats and their solutions lie. 
Monica is a proven public servant 
through and through. Over the years, 
she has fought for what matters most. 
For example, during her time at the 
Defense Department, she worked to end 
discriminatory 
practices 
against 
women in the military, to provide 
them with opportunities that were pre-
viously closed to them simply because 
of their gender. 
After her time at DOD, she continued 
the track record of fighting for what is 
most important by calling out the con-
nection between illegal wildlife traf-
ficking and organized criminal net-
works, confronting illegal fishing that 
is too often tied to global piracy and 
human rights violations. 
Her 
expertise 
in 
globe-spanning 
threats to our national security is ex-
actly why former Secretary of Defense

Leon Panetta and the Center for Stra-
tegic and International Studies have 
turned to her as an expert and adviser, 
because she knows that we can’t pro-
tect ourselves at home without a ro-
bust strategy abroad. 
Throughout her career, she has prov-
en to be a pragmatic and solutions-fo-
cused public servant by working across 
the aisle and with stakeholders from 
different States and industries in the 
United States to find ways to protect 
our oceans and our ocean economy. 
After the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, 
Monica collaborated with five Repub-
lican Governors of affected States to 
get $1 billion in restoration funds from 
oil company BP so that States could 
quickly stop rebounding from the dis-
aster. 
Her work at NOAA was praised by 
groups like the Seafood Harvesters of 
America, who support her experience 
and legacy of protecting our oceans 
and the workers and communities that 
depend upon them. 
Louis Pasteur once said: 
Science knows no country, because knowl-
edge belongs to humanity, and is the torch 
which illuminates the world. Science is the 
highest personification of the nation because 
that nation will remain the first which car-
ries the furthest the works of thought and 
intelligence. 
Monica Medina has dedicated her ca-
reer to promoting America’s excellence 
in these two realms—the tools of 
science and the values of humanity— 
because it is there where America’s 
promise to the world can be found. 
I want to reiterate very strongly that 
she has served every mission, she has 
fulfilled every goal that she has been 
given, and every discussion that she 
has ever had has always resulted in 
people holding us in the highest regard 
by the key stakeholders in every issue 
she has touched. I want to reiterate my 
strong support for her nomination and 
hope my colleagues will join me in con-
firming her for this important position. 
I yield the floor.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent, notwithstanding 
rule XXII, that upon the use or yield-
ing back of time on the Donfried nomi-
nation, the Senate vote on the motions 
to invoke cloture on the Medina, Phee, 
Robinson, and Lewis nominations; that 
if closure is invoked on any of the 
nominations 
listed, 
all 
postcloture 
time be considered expired and the 
vote on confirmation of those nomina-
tions occur at a time and in an order to 
be determined by the majority leader, 
following consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, with 1 hour for debate 
equally divided prior to each vote, and 
the Republican debate be controlled by 
Senator CRUZ. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MURPHY. For the information of 
the Senate, we expect four rollcall 
votes beginning at around 8 p.m. Those 
votes will be cloture on the Medina, 
Phee, Robinson, and Lewis nomina-
tions. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
glad that we are coming to some con-
clusion this evening with respect to a 
handful of the long list of pending 
nominations for the State Department 
and the Department of Defense, but it 
is a small portion of a list that is grow-
ing bigger and bigger. 
Never before has a first-term Presi-
dent had this few national security 
nominees in place by the fall of his 
first year. And this is a growing na-
tional security crisis imposed on the 
country by Republicans who have de-
cided to put their hatred of Democrats 
and this President ahead of the secu-
rity of this country—above the secu-
rity of this Nation. 
And it just takes a lot of hutzpah for 
my colleagues to stand here on the 
floor and criticize the President’s con-
duct of foreign policy at the same time 
that they are refusing to allow the 
President to have staff to conduct for-
eign policy. Let me say that again. We 
have all sorts of Republicans coming 
down here and savaging the President’s 
policy on Afghanistan or on China or 
on Russia, but then, at the exact same 
time, taking extraordinary steps to 
prevent the President from having any-
body actually implement policies to-
ward Afghanistan or Russia or China. 
It is akin to standing up in a res-
taurant and complaining about how 
slow the service is right after you went 
and barricaded the doors in and out of 
the kitchen. 
My colleagues can’t have it both 
ways. If you want to complain about 
the President’s policies toward China, 
then stop standing in the way of allow-
ing him to have personnel that can exe-
cute on sound policy. Stop standing in 
the way of the Assistant Secretary who 
will oversee policy in the region. 
You have complaints about Afghani-
stan. Then why are we continuing to 
block those who would be in charge of 
refugee policy and in charge of reset-
tlement policy to get more Afghans out 
of the country? 
You have complaints about Russia. 
Well, for a month Republicans have 
been blocking the key personnel who 
oversee policy toward Russia, whether 
it be the Assistant Secretary for Eu-
rope or our Ambassador to NATO. 
Here is what voters are left to won-
der: Are these sincere objections based 
upon policy or is this really about an 
intentional effort to try to undermine 
the security of this country in order to 
damage Joe Biden? 
I don’t know the answer to that ques-
tion, but I can’t figure out any plau-
sible reason how this benefits the coun-
try. Never before—never before—has a 
minority gone to these lengths to try 
to undermine a President’s national se-
curity team. 
Every single Democrat had massive 
objections, moral and practical, to 
President Trump’s foreign policy, but 
not a single one of us contemplated 
doing what our Republican colleagues 
are doing right now—holding up every 
single one of Donald Trump’s Ambas-
sadors and nominees—because we knew 
that that would undermine the secu-
rity of the country, because there are 
differences that we have, but there are 
far more points of agreement where 
midlevel civil servants and Ambas-
sadors are carrying out policies on be-
half of America that Republicans and 
Democrats agree on. 
Here is the list of nominees that are 
stuck. What does the Chief of Protocol 
have to do with Nord Stream 2? What 
does the Ambassador to Vietnam have 
to do with the objections of the Sen-
ator from Texas over an oil pipeline? 
Why are we blocking the Assistant Ad-
ministrator for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development? 
Nothing that is happening here has 
anything to do with the security of this 
country. 
So I am glad we are unlocking a 
handful of nominees, but we are going 
to be here on Thursdays and Fridays 
and Saturdays and Sundays. I am going 
to advocate that we stay as long as it 
takes in order to protect this country, 
in order to stop this unprecedented 
blockade of the people who do the work 
of standing up for the security of this 
Nation every single day. 
One of the critiques that has been 
lodged here today is about the Presi-
dent’s proposal and his execution of his 
proposal to wind down the 20-year war 
in Afghanistan. In fact, one of my col-
leagues said that until the Secretary of 
State resigns, he will continue to block 
all Department of Defense and State 
Department nominees, knowing that 
that is not going to happen. 
So I do want to spend a few minutes 
this evening talking about the real 
story behind President Biden’s decision 
to bring a 20-year war that has cost 
this country $2 trillion, has cost this 
Nation thousands of lives, and has 
ended up in hundreds of thousands of 
Afghans being killed—let’s just be very 
clear at the outset. President Biden’s 
decision to bring U.S. troops home 
from Afghanistan is wildly popular— 
supported by three out of four Ameri-
cans. And I want to talk about the dan-
ger of what has happened over the 
course of the last 2 months with this 
critique of the President’s withdrawal 
plan. Some of it is legitimate, but 
some of it is really dangerous. 
So, in 2009, President Obama planned 
to send a whole bunch of additional 
troops 
into 
Afghanistan. 
It 
was 
Obama’s surge—the idea that we would 
plus-up our troops there. We would 
partner with diplomats and aid admin-
istrators. It was a means to try to con-
quer and then hold territory in Afghan-
istan that had been taken by the 
Taliban. 
It was a really good plan. It had all 
kinds of counterinsurgency buzz words. 
The PowerPoint looked really sharp. 
And it was endorsed by a lot of smart

foreign policy thinkers. But then it 
was a total flop. It didn’t work. I saw it 
in person. 
In 2011, I went out to a small town in 
western Afghanistan, where the surge 
was taking place, where a group of U.S. 
soldiers had taken back territory that 
had been previously controlled by the 
Taliban. We got a tour of this small 
town called Parmakan, and the elders 
in that town told us that the Taliban 
forced them to grow poppy. Poppy, 
then, was given or sold to the Taliban 
and used to fuel and fund the Taliban’s 
insurgency against the United States. 
And now that the U.S. troops were 
there, poppy was still being grown in 
the fields. It was still being sold to the 
Taliban. The difference was that now 
the Taliban wasn’t stealing it. The 
Taliban was paying a fairer price for 
the poppy, but we were still protecting 
the fields, a crop that was being sold to 
our enemy to finance the insurgency 
against us. It was a very clear, con-
crete example of how a plan that 
looked really good on paper wasn’t 
playing out to our national security 
benefit in reality. 
Afghanistan wasn’t a failure of exe-
cution. It was a failure of hubris. We 
came to believe that we could do some-
thing in Afghanistan that was, in re-
ality, unachievable, though, on paper, 
achievable. This idea that we could 
build an American-style democracy 
and an American-style military on the 
other side of the world amidst a cul-
ture we did not understand turned out 
to be an impossibility. 
But general after general, adminis-
tration after administration, we re-
fused to accept that reality. We be-
lieved that America could accomplish 
this feat, despite the fact that year 
after year, especially in the last dec-
ade, the Taliban got stronger and the 
amount of territory they conquered 
was bigger. The ability of the Afghan 
military and government to be able to 
deliver services and protect the people 
became less and less. 
One would think that the overnight 
collapse of the Afghan Government se-
curity forces on the 15th of August 
would have finally broken the back of 
this American ‘‘execute better’’ think-
ing, this belief that if we just fine-tune 
the plan once again, we will be able to 
do the impossible. But it is clear that, 
in fact, the opposite had happened; 
that since the fall of the Afghan Gov-
ernment and military, there has been 
new life infused into the architects and 
the cheerleaders of American military 
hubris’s arguments. 
The scenes from the Kabul airport in 
the weeks following the Afghan Gov-
ernment’s disintegration, they were 
devastating to watch. The stories of 
young girls and human rights activists 
desperately clamoring for a route out 
of the country, they were heart-
breaking to hear. But the idea that the 
United States of America, a country lo-
cated on the other side of the world 
from Kabul, could manage this unex-
pected collapse in a way that didn’t 
produce panic and confusion or that we 
would be able to evacuate and find a 
home outside of the country for every 
Afghan who wanted to leave—it was, 
unfortunately, the same kind of mag-
ical thinking that got us into this mess 
in the first place and that kept us 
there for 10 years too long. It is just as 
illusory as the now-proven fantasy 
trumpeted by war hawks that America 
could build and train an Afghan Gov-
ernment and military into a new 
version of their American counter-
parts. And we risk falling into this trap 
again, believing that America can do 
things abroad that are beyond our 
reach. 
There are plenty of fights that are 
winnable. There is plenty of good that 
America can do. But there are limits, 
especially limits to our authority when 
we are leading with military interven-
tion. 
There are no doubts there were mis-
takes made throughout the period of 
evacuation of U.S. forces and diplomats 
from Afghanistan. There is no way you 
run a mission that complicated with-
out going back and finding things that 
you would have done differently. 
But in the end, we got 130,000 people 
out. That is the single biggest airlift of 
Americans and partners, certainly, in 
our lifetime and likely in the history of 
this country. 
It is hard to argue with those results 
in the end—130,000 Americans and Af-
ghans taken out in a period of 2 weeks, 
when America controlled only the air-
port and no territory around it because 
of the disintegration of the Afghan 
military. 
But for many in Washington, many 
in the foreign policy consensus, many 
of the folks who want to stay in Af-
ghanistan forever, they say 130,000 
wasn’t good enough. But what is their 
specific complaint? 
Some of them say that the scenes at 
the airport of chaos was Joe Biden’s 
fault. That is maybe the most nonsen-
sical of the arguments because once 
the Afghan military and government 
fell apart overnight, there was nothing 
that 
a 
couple 
thousand 
American 
troops and diplomats were going to be 
able to do to prevent that chaos. 
You can argue that the United States 
should have seen that collapse coming, 
but the Afghan people didn’t have ac-
cess to our intelligence. The Afghan 
people didn’t know that that was all 
going to fall apart overnight. And so, 
of course, when they heard that the 
United States was running flights out 
of Kabul, there was going to be a mad 
rush to the airport. It just doesn’t 
make any sense to suggest that a cou-
ple thousand Americans inside Afghan-
istan were going to be able to prevent 
some 
very 
chaotic 
scenes 
on 
the 
ground. 
Other critics set a lower bar. They 
say that, well, the President couldn’t 
have prevented the chaos, but he 
should have managed the evacuation 
better. 
Again, I will concede that there are 
things that could have been done bet-
ter. But let’s just talk about what the 
scene looked like on the ground. Let’s 
talk about the reality. 
The reality is that the Taliban con-
trolled the entire city outside of the 
airport. And when your enemy controls 
99 percent of the country that you are 
trying 
to 
evacuate, 
unfortunately, 
many of the decisions about how the 
evacuation goes and how efficient or 
effective it is are outside of your con-
trol. 
The idea that in 2 weeks we were 
going to be able to manage a seamless 
evacuation of the country, when our 
enemy controlled 99 percent of it, is lu-
dicrous. 
Again, there is no doubt that things 
could have been done better. But in the 
end, we got 130,000 Americans out. We 
were very creative about the means 
and the methods by which we used to 
get our people home. 
Another criticism is that the Presi-
dent didn’t get everybody out. Well, 
let’s just remember what happened in 
the months leading up to the evacu-
ation. Nineteen different times, the 
Biden administration told Americans 
who were there that things were going 
to get bad, and they should leave. Now, 
that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t do 
everything within our power to try to 
get those Americans out who didn’t lis-
ten to those reminders. But it does 
mean that the President doesn’t bear 
all of the blame for those who stayed 
after having reminded them over a 
dozen times that it was probably time 
to leave. 
It is a little difficult to hear this 
righteous 
indignation 
from 
Repub-
licans about the President not getting 
more Afghans out when it is the Re-
publican Party that is standing in the 
way of these refugees coming to the 
United States. Many of the same crit-
ics of the President’s Afghanistan pol-
icy are the exact same Republicans 
who are right now saying that their 
State isn’t going to take any Afghan 
refugees. 
You can’t have it both ways. You 
can’t criticize the President for not 
getting more of our partners out but 
then say that they shouldn’t go any 
further than an airplane hangar in 
Doha, that your State isn’t going to 
take any of these evacuees, any of 
these refugees. 
And, lastly, the most recent argu-
ment by this ‘‘execute better’’ crowd— 
the folks who think that, just like we 
could have succeeded in Afghanistan if 
we stayed another 10 years, we could 
have run a perfect and beautiful-look-
ing evacuation in the midst of a coun-
try in chaos—is that America could 
have stayed indefinitely because the 
option somehow became much less 
costly and much less risky in 2021. 
These are the folks who say we should 
have kept a couple thousand troops 
there, and everything would have been 
fine. 
President Trump negotiated with the 
Taliban. The deal was that he would

draw down to 2,500 troops and then ev-
erybody else would leave in 2021. In ex-
change, the Taliban said: We won’t at-
tack U.S. forces, and we will not ad-
vance on provincial capitals. 
So when Joe Biden came to office, 
that was his reality. There were only a 
couple 
thousand 
troops 
left. 
The 
Taliban 
had 
gobbled 
up 
immense 
amounts of territory during the Trump 
administration, and they stood right 
outside of these capitals. Had Joe 
Biden chosen to walk away from that 
deal, hostilities would have begun be-
tween the United States and the 
Taliban. And I have listened to gen-
erals tell us for the last 10 years that 
there is no way that the United States 
could protect its own forces and stand 
up an effective Afghan military oper-
ation with less than 8,500. All of a sud-
den—all of a sudden—2,500 was enough, 
when for years the military was telling 
us, if you get down below 10,000, you 
are in big trouble. 
But that doesn’t even speak to the 
new reality that greeted us in 2021. 
That was the Taliban now not just out 
in the hinterlands, not just fighting for 
control of rural Afghanistan but on the 
precipice of these cities, ready to get 
involved in complicated, deadly, urban 
warfare. That argues for the number 
not being 8,500 but being twice that or 
three times that likely would have 
been necessary in order to buttress and 
stand up and support the Afghan mili-
tary when street fighting happened in-
side these provincial capitals. Twenty- 
five 
hundred 
wasn’t 
going 
to 
be 
enough. 
Of course, the real desire for most of 
these ‘‘execute better’’ thinkers was 
for America to just stay. Now, I know 
folks bristle at this phrase ‘‘forever 
war.’’ A lot of folks say that we should 
have kept 2,500, 5,000 there. They say 
that we weren’t going to stay forever. 
They just say we should stay until we 
finish the job, which is defined as es-
tablishing 
an 
American-style 
rep-
resentative government and an Amer-
ican-style unified military command. 
But if we couldn’t accomplish that in 
20 years—the longest U.S. war in his-
tory—why on Earth do we think that 
things would have changed after an-
other 5 or another 10? My belief is that 
the goal that we set out was, unfortu-
nately, impossible, which is why that 
PowerPoint slide reads, we stay in Af-
ghanistan until it is stable; while re-
ality reads, stay forever. 
It is worth reminding that Americans 
overwhelmingly supported this plan to 
withdraw because they had seen how 
the plans never matched up with re-
ality on the ground, and it was ulti-
mately their sons’ and daughters’ blood 
that was going to be spilled. It was 
their money that was going to be 
spent. 
The real danger is casually coming to 
this collective American conclusion 
that, just like our occupation was pos-
sible but executed poorly, that the 
withdrawal was simply a failure of 
planning, rather than an inevitability, 
given the circumstances handed to 
President Biden and his team. 
There are some military missions 
that cannot be completed, no matter 
how smart the planners are. This les-
son has got to be learned or we are des-
tined to suffer more Iraqs and more Af-
ghanistans. 
Finally, I will end with this: It is 
worth noting—and I said this earlier— 
that just because the mission we set 
out to achieve in Afghanistan was not 
possible, that that doesn’t mean that 
everything else is impossible. That 
doesn’t mean that America can’t be a 
force for good in the world. 
Our experience in Afghanistan is not 
a reason to disappear from global en-
gagement. Just because this big thing 
wasn’t possible doesn’t mean that 
every big thing is impossible. 
And so my hope is that by with-
drawing from Afghanistan, we allow for 
the Biden administration and adminis-
trations to follow to be able to pivot to 
contests and fights that we can win, to 
put more effort into contesting Chinese 
expansionism, or to put more effort 
into providing nonmilitary aid to or-
ganic local democracy movements, or 
being more of a force for economic em-
powerment in the developing world. 
These are goals that are difficult, but 
they are achievable. 
So there are plenty of negative con-
sequences to our withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan, but there are also beneficial 
consequences as well. 
The greatest benefit is that we now 
have this energy and money and man-
power that has been devoted to this 
failing mission for 20 years that can 
now be directed to these more achiev-
able and more worthwhile goals, but 
only if we cure ourselves of this ‘‘exe-
cute better’’ mentality that is often 
connected to our military intervention. 
I think that is necessary so that Amer-
ica never again gets distracted from 
achievable goals by another impossible 
Afghanistan-like mission. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me say thank you to the few re-
maining colleagues, but everyone else 
also, for staying here late into the 
evening as we continue to confirm 
these important nominees to the Biden 
administration. 
Now, in a few moments, I will be fil-
ing cloture on the continuing resolu-
tion that was passed by the House of 
Representatives this week. The resolu-
tion is the answer for avoiding numer-
ous fast-approaching crises on the hori-
zon, including an unnecessary govern-
ment shutdown and a first-ever default 
on our country’s sovereign debt. 
Members should be advised the clo-
ture vote will take place this coming 
Monday. Every single Member in this 
Chamber is going on record as to 
whether they support keeping the gov-
ernment open and averting a default or 
support shutting us down and careen-
ing our country toward a default. 
At the end of the day, frankly, the 
only thing that matters in the legisla-
tive body is how you vote. It is what 
our constituents sent us here to do. 
Now, our Republican colleagues say 
they don’t want a shutdown. They say 
they don’t want a credit default. They 
say they want hurricane aid. Then the 
answer is simple. Just vote yes on this 
bill, and it will all get done. 
But if Republicans vote no, as many 
of them are saying they will, the Re-
publican Party will solidify itself as 
the party of default—the party of de-
fault. They will endanger every single 
American in this country, including 
those who rely on Social Security and 
Medicare benefits. They will hurt small 
businesses, pensioners, and our vet-
erans. 
If my Republican colleagues want to 
help the American people avoid calam-
ity, they can vote yes to keep the gov-
ernment open. They can vote yes on 
suspending the debt limit. It is in their 
hands. 
But come Monday, if Republicans 
vote in favor of a shutdown and de-
fault, the American people will see ex-
actly who is responsible for throwing 
our country in crisis. There will be the 
President requesting this bill, the 
House having passed the bill, the ma-
jority putting this bill on the floor, and 
then the Republicans blocking it. Who 
is responsible for the default?

Res. 383, S. Res. 384, and S. Res. 385.

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today with my colleagues Senators 
Collins, Baldwin, Blumenthal, Brown, 
Casey, Hassan, Kaine, King, Klobuchar, 
Markey, Menendez, Rosen, Smith, Van 
Hollen, and Warren to recognize the 
week beginning September 12, 2021, as 
National Direct Support Professionals 
Recognition Week. Direct support pro-
fessionals are an invaluable part of our 
Nation’s healthcare system, caring for 
the most vulnerable Americans, includ-
ing the chronically ill, seniors, and 
those living with a disability. Direct 
support professionals include, among 
others, those whose titles include home 
caregiver, 
personal 
care 
assistant, 
home care worker, or home health 
aide. These varying titles speaks to the 
broad areas of support that are integral 
to the work of direct support profes-
sionals. With the assistance of direct 
support professionals, these individuals 
can perform daily activities that many 
people take for granted, such as eating, 
bathing, dressing, and leaving the 
house. The work of direct support pro-
fessionals ensures that these individ-
uals can be active participants in their 
communities. 
The work of direct support profes-
sionals, like all of us, has changed due 
to the ongoing novel coronavirus— 
COVID–19—pandemic. 
In 
supporting 
their clients in performing activities of 
daily living, direct support profes-
sionals are essential and must continue 
to work in close proximity to their cli-
ents during the pandemic. Recognizing 
the work of direct support profes-
sionals is important, but all the more 
so as the pandemic continues, given 
their dedication to supporting the 
health and well-being of their clients. 
Let me share with you the experience 
of Tommy Sharrow. Tommy is a direct 
support professional who was recog-
nized this year for his dedicated and 
selfless work when he was given Mary-
land’s Direct Support Professional of 
the Year Award by the American Net-
work of Community Options and Re-
sources, ANCOR.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6667 
September 23, 2021 
I am sure there are countless exam-
ples I could share about Tommy’s 
work, but I will describe one extraor-
dinary example where he went above 
and beyond for his clients as he contin-
ued to care for them in the midst of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. During a particu-
larly challenging period of the pan-
demic, Tommy’s tireless dedication 
was on full display as he quarantined 
with his clients in their home to con-
tinue caring for them when others in 
their 
home 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
COVID–19. In order to maintain the 
care he provided for them, Tommy in-
credibly slept on an air mattress in 
their basement for 2 weeks to effec-
tively quarantine. As day programs 
and other care options closed around 
his 
clients 
due 
to 
the 
pandemic, 
Tommy stepped in to provide creative 
activities 
like 
music 
and 
playing 
games in outdoor spaces. Throughout a 
challenging year for us all, Tommy was 
steadfast and truly considerate in his 
care for his clients. 
Tommy’s story describes a career 
that is fulfilling, but one that often-
times is not easy for direct support 
professionals like him. The hours are 
often long, and the wages are low. The 
job can be physically laborious, as well 
as emotionally draining. The reward 
for direct support professionals, how-
ever, is that they are able to improve 
the lives of individuals with disabil-
ities and help fulfill the promise of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act by 
making it possible for these Americans 
to participate in their communities to 
the fullest extent possible. 
In our country, we are incredibly for-
tunate to have millions of service-ori-
ented individuals who are willing to 
rise to the task of becoming a direct 
support professional. According to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the em-
ployment of direct support profes-
sionals is projected to grow by an aver-
age of 33 percent from 2020 to 2030, com-
pared to an 8-percent average growth 
rate for all occupations during that pe-
riod. The demand will only continue to 
increase over time; the Baby Boomer 
generation will result in the doubling 
of the population of adults ages 65 and 
older by 2050. The increased demand for 
direct support professionals has cre-
ated shortages in some areas, which 
can place strains on patients and their 
families or result in medical issues 
that could have been avoided. 
Unfortunately, direct support profes-
sionals are often forced to leave the 
jobs they love due to low wages and ex-
cessive, difficult work hours. Many di-
rect support professionals rely on pub-
lic benefits, and some must work mul-
tiple jobs in order to provide for them-
selves and their families. Now, more 
than ever, it is imperative that we 
work to ensure that these hard-work-
ing individuals have the income and 
emotional support they need and de-
serve as we all struggle with the health 
and economic implications of the ongo-
ing pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and

nating the week beginning September 
12, 2021, as National Direct Support

Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolutions be agreed to,

BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
an instruction to the chairman of the 
Senate Committee on the Budget to 
file enforceable levels in the Senate in 
the event the budget was agreed to 
without the need to appoint a com-
mittee of conference on the measure. 
On Wednesday, August 11, 2021, the 
Senate passed the budget resolution, 
and 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
passed it without changes on August 
24. As such, today, I submit the re-
quired filing. 
Specifically, section 4006 of the fiscal 
year 2022 congressional budget resolu-
tion allows the chairman to file an al-
location for fiscal year 2022 for the 
Committee on Appropriations and an 
allocation for fiscal years 2022, 2022 
through 2026, and 2022 through 2031 for 
committees other than the Committee 
on Appropriations. The figures in-
cluded in this filing are consistent with 
the levels included in S. Con. Res. 14. 
For purposes of enforcing the Sen-
ate’s pay-as-you-go rule, which is found 
in section 4106 of the fiscal year 2018 
congressional budget resolution, I am 
resetting the Senate’s scorecard to zero 
for all fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL CARTER F. 
HAM, U.S. ARMY, RETIRED 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, on behalf 
of myself and Mr. INHOFE, as the chair 
and ranking member of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee and the co-
chairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is 
our honor to pay tribute to a great 
leader and exceptional advocate for the 
U.S. Army, GEN Carter F. Ham, U.S. 
Army, Retired, as he retires from his 
current position as the president and 
chief executive officer of the Associa-
tion of the United States Army, AUSA. 
General Ham exemplifies a lifetime of 
service. 
Carter enlisted as a private and ulti-
mately joined only a small group of 
soldiers in the history of the Army by 
earning the rank of Four-Star general, 
leading at every level in the Army, 
from platoon to geographic combatant 
command, along the way. His Army ca-
reer began as an enlisted infantry sol-
dier in the 82nd Airborne Division and 
culminated 
as 
the 
Commander 
of 
United States Africa Command. His 
service took him to Italy, Germany, 
Kuwait, 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
Macedonia, 
Qatar, Iraq, and over 40 African coun-
tries, and his commands included the 
1st Infantry Division, the legendary 
‘‘Big Red One,’’ and U.S. Army Europe. 
As the second commander of United 
States Africa Command, he led all U.S. 
military activities on the African con-
tinent ranging from combat operations 
in Libya to hostage rescue operations 
in Somalia, as well as training and se-
curity assistance activities across 54 
complex and diverse African nations. 
His leadership was compassionate and 
inclusive and left the Army better from 
his service. 
General Ham retired from the Army 
in June of 2013 after nearly 38 years, 
but his service continued. In the years 
after retirement from Active Duty, he 
served as the chairman of the National 
Commission on the Future of the 
Army, an eight-member panel tasked 
by Congress with making recommenda-
tions on the size, force structure, and 
capabilities of the Total Army. Since 
2016, he has served admirably as the 
president and CEO of AUSA, carrying 
out its mission to support soldiers, 
their families, and Army civilians; pro-
vide a voice for the Army; and honor 
those who have served. 
Established to educate, inform, and 
connect, General Ham guided AUSA 
through a period of unprecedented 
growth of membership, creating an en-
vironment for industry and inter-
national partners to build their rela-
tionships with the U.S. Army. With in-
genuity and perseverance while navi-
gating through the COVID–19 pan-
demic, he kept the professional and 
education-centered association oper-
ating smoothly without decreasing any 
staffing, all while finding new opportu-
nities and formats to support the 
Army. General Ham provided steady 
leadership in his advocacy with Con-
gress supporting the Army—Regular, 
Guard, and Reserve—as well as Army 
families, civilians, retirees, and vet-
erans. He embraced the Army’s ‘‘Peo-
ple First’’ mission while advocating for 
readiness and modernization with a 
balanced perspective; he ardently sup-
ported the Army while respecting and 
working with the other military serv-
ices. Through his vision for the future 
and commitment to honor all who 
served in the past, General Ham and 
AUSA enabled the Army, its soldiers 
and veterans, and the American people, 
to realize a National Museum of the 
U.S. Army. He has served the United 
States, the Army, and the Association 
of the United States Army with great 
distinction and exceptional leadership, 
wisdom, and humility. 
On behalf of Congress and the United 
States of America, we thank General 
Ham, his wife Christi, and their entire 
family for their commitment, sacrifice, 
and contributions to this great Nation. 
We join our colleagues in wishing him 
the long and joyful retirement he so 
richly deserves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

September 23, 2021 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize BluMine Health, LLC of Louis-
ville, KY, as the Senate Small Business 
of the Week. 
Headquartered 
in 
Louisville, 
KY, 
BluMine Health began operations 6 
years ago as Alternative Health Solu-
tions. Led by Michael Dees, BluMine 
Health was established to meet a de-
mand for individualized, easily acces-
sible medical care. Through its direct 
primary care—DPC—model, BluMine 
Health provides local businesses with 
affordable healthcare services. As an 
alternative to fee-for-service insurance 
billing, BluMine Health’s DPC charges 
employers a flat monthly per-employee 
fee. This fee covers primary care serv-
ices, including clinical and laboratory 
services, 
consultative 
services, 
and 
comprehensive care management. DPC 
allows family physicians to care for the 
whole person, reducing the overhead 
and 
negative 
incentives 
associated 
with fee-for-service third-party-payer 
billing. Through onsite care clinics and 
shared on-site care centers, BluMine 
Health provides a practical alternative 
to the third-party insurance coverage 
system. 
Today, BluMine Health has become a 
regional leader in direct primary care. 
They continue serving communities 
across Kentucky, with locations in 
Brandenburg, Lexington, Madisonville, 
Elizabethtown, Somerset, Richmond, 
Shelbyville, 
Shepherdsville, 
and 
Dunnville. BluMine Health provides 
care to dozens of clients, covering 
20,000 individuals and their families. 
Since 
2019, 
BluMine 
Health 
has 
partnered with Baptist Health, the 
leading healthcare provider in Ken-
tucky and southern Indiana, to provide 
additional services such as hospital 
care and physical therapy to its cli-
ents. BluMine Health is expanding its 
services throughout the Ohio River 
Valley, establishing a clinic in Jef-
fersonville, IN, and announcing an ex-
pansion into Ohio in August 2021. 
Like many small businesses, BluMine 
Health is active in its community. Lo-
cally, BluMine Health regularly sup-
ports nonprofit organizations and spon-
sors charity events, such as the Ken-
tucky Harvest fifth annual golf tour-
nament. They are actively involved 
with industry and business organiza-
tions, including the chamber of com-
merce and the Health Enterprise Net-
work, Louisville’s regional healthcare 
business network. As a healthcare pro-
vider, BluMine Health stepped up to 
meet the challenges posed by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. They continued to 
offer in-person care and adapted to pro-
vide telemedicine service, with tele-
health appointments surpassing 40 per-
cent of their medical delivery. Through 
their partnership with Baptist Health, 
BluMine Health provided a COVID–19 
workplace reopening service, enabling 
local businesses to create and maintain 
healthy workplaces as lockdowns lift-
ed. 
BluMine Health, LLC is a notable ex-
ample of the critical role that small, 
community-oriented 
healthcare 
pro-
viders 
play 
in 
their 
communities. 
Local medical practices like BluMine 
Health form the heart of towns across 
Kentucky, regularly stepping up to 
support their communities in times of 
crisis. Congratulations to Michael and 
the entire team at BluMine Health, 
LLC. I wish them the best of luck and 
look forward to watching their contin-
ued growth and success in Kentucky 
and beyond.∑

RECOGNIZING DAN-O’S SEASONING 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize a family-owned small business 
and Louisville staple, Dan-O’s Sea-
soning of Louisville, KY, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
Like many college students, Dan Oli-
ver knew nothing about cooking. One 
day, while seasoning chicken, he threw 
together some spices and cooked the 
best chicken he had ever had. That 
spice blend planted the seeds for what 
would become Dan-O’s Seasoning. Over 
the next 15 years, whenever he cooked 
for friends and family, Dan used his 
original spice recipe. After a career in 
the professional sector, Dan joined the 
restaurant industry as a cook and bar-
tender. Dan, an aspiring entrepreneur, 
used his passion for cooking to develop 
what he called his ‘‘million-dollar 
idea:’’ selling his signature seasoning 
mix. Two years—and nearly 200 modi-
fications 
later—Dan-O’s 
Seasoning 
launched in 2017. 
Today, Dan-O’s Seasoning is a thriv-
ing company selling products nation-
wide. The business is based in Louis-
ville, where Dan and his team prepare 
and package the product. Initially, Dan 
traveled across Kentucky selling his 
seasoning at trade shows and flea mar-
kets. The low-sodium, sugar-free, 100- 
percent natural seasoning was a hit, 
with sales doubling every year. Dan-O’s 
Seasoning was soon available at Louis-
ville-area stores and online. Like many 
small business owners, Dan adapted to 
overcome the challenges caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. With the trade 
show circuit closed, he turned to social 
media to keep his business afloat. After 
a video clip went viral on TikTok, a 
video creating and sharing platform, 
Dan-O’s gained thousands of new cus-
tomers and increased its sales more 
than tenfold. Their success was profiled 
in several local and national outlets, 
including WDRB, the Louisville Cou-
rier-Journal, Louisville Business Jour-
nal, and BuzzFeed. And in March 2021, 
Dan-O’s exponential growth led to 
their products being sold at Kroger’s, a 
regional supermarket chain located in 
the Midwest and South. 
Like many small business owners, 
Dan is actively involved in his commu-
nity. Locally, Dan-O’s Seasoning regu-
larly supports community organiza-
tions, including the Louisville V.F.W. 
Post 6182, the Permanently Disabled 
Jockey Fund, and the Boone County 
Cancer Society. When the company 
hosts events, like its annual cornhole 
tournament, they prioritize working 
with local small businesses. Notably 
Dan-O’s Seasoning sponsors several 
athletes, including NASCAR drivers, 
dirt-track racers, tournament fishers, 
cornhole players, and NCAA athletes. 
In June 2021, Dan earned the Silver 
Fleur-De-Lis Award from the Greater 
Louisville, Inc. Metro Chamber of Com-
merce, recognizing his company’s expo-
nential growth and innovative mar-
keting tactics. 
Dan-O’s Seasoning is a remarkable 
example of how hard work, ingenuity, 
and discipline can turn a dream into 
reality. Small businesses like Dan-O’s 
Seasoning form the heart of towns 
across Kentucky, regularly stepping up 
to support their communities. Con-
gratulations to Dan and the entire 
team at Dan-O’s Seasoning. I wish 
them the best of luck and look forward 
to watching their continued growth 
and success in Kentucky and beyond.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVE HUTTON 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Dave Hutton of Flathead County as 
Montanan of the Month for his dedica-
tion to serving the Kalispell commu-
nity as a parking officer. 
Dave brings a positive and upbeat at-
titude to one of the most thankless 
jobs in the Flathead Valley. Whether it 
is a sweltering July day or a snowy De-
cember 
morning, 
Patrolman 
Dave 
greets every Montanan he meets with a 
smile. 
It is the simple things that make 
Dave a model Montanan. Locals have 
seen him stop in roadways to protect 
pedestrians from oncoming traffic, and 
he is often spotted chatting with local 
shop owners who are always excited to 
see a friendly face. 
One early June morning, Dave was 
rounding a corner on Main Street and 
noticed a line of debris littering the 
street and blocking the sidewalk. Un-
beknownst to him, the night before, a 
reckless drunk driver had driven off 
the road damaging thousands of dollars 
in property. Instead of ignoring the 
mess, Dave took the initiative to stop 
and clean up the area. 
This silent service to the community 
was just one of many in his tenure. 
Through his kindness and positivity, 
Patrolman Dave has made a lasting im-
pression on the citizens who live, work, 
and shop in Kalispell. 
It is my honor to recognize Dave for 
his dedication to the Kalispell commu-
nity and for doing the small, silent 
acts of service that are often forgotten. 
Keep up the great work, Dave.∑

ices. 
LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION NO. 1 
Whereas, the Department of Defense re-
cently reestablished the United States Space 
Command as the eleventh unified combatant 
command of the Armed Forces; and 
Whereas, the United States Air Force re-
quested that state and community leaders 
nominate military locations to host the 
United States Space Command headquarters; 
and 
Whereas, the city of Bellevue, Nebraska, 
on behalf of community, state, and regional 
leaders and officials and in conjunction with 
support from local military leaders, nomi-
nated Offutt Air Force Base to be the loca-
tion for the United States Space Command 
headquarters; and 
Whereas, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts 
endorsed 
the 
application 
recommending 
Offutt Air Force Base for the honor of be-
coming the permanent host for the United 
States Space Command headquarters; and 
Whereas, Offutt Air Force Base and the 
neighbouring Bellevue and Omaha commu-
nities received top scores on the basing cri-
teria established by the United States Air 
Force including: proximity to mutually sup-
porting space entities; an available qualified 
workforce; infrastructure and facility capac-
ity; high bandwidth communications infra-
structure; enhanced security; energy resil-
ience; cost efficiencies; and community sup-
port; and 
Whereas, Offutt Air Force Base is among 
six sites being considered by the Air Force to 
host the United States Space Command 
headquarters; and 
Whereas, Offutt Air Force Base is the home 
for global missions of national consequence, 
the joint, interagency, coalition, Guard, and 
Reserve presence would complement the 
needs of the United States Space Command; 
and 
Whereas, several Offutt Air Force Base 
units of interest include the 55th Wing, 
which provides dominant worldwide recon-
naissance, real-time intelligence, command 
and control, and information warfare; the 
595th Command and Control Group sup-
porting strategic nuclear deterrence; the Air 
Force’s only weather wing; and the newly 
formed Marine Corps Forces Space Com-
mand; and 
Whereas, the largest tenant on Offutt Air 
Force Base is a global warfighting combat-
ant command, the United States Strategic 
Command, which has a mission set that com-
bines the United States legacy nuclear com-
mand and control mission with responsi-
bility for space operations, global strike, and 
global missile defense to deter strategic at-
tacks and employ forces, as directed, to 
guarantee the security of our nation and our 
allies; and 
Whereas, the United States Strategic Com-
mand oversees and manages the Nuclear 
Command, Control, and Communications En-
terprise Center; and the United States Space 
Command is a key member of the Nuclear 
Command, Control, and Communications En-
terprise Stakeholder Council; and 
Whereas, for seventeen years, from 2002 to 
2019, 
America’s 
military 
space 
mission 
headquartered at Offutt Air Force Base as 
part of the United States Strategic Com-
mand mission set; and 
Whereas, the history of hosting the United 
States Strategic Command and units that 
mutually support joint combatant com-
mands serves as an excellent foundation for 
Offutt Air Force Base to create additional 
synergies and efficiencies; and 
Whereas, community support for military 
missions; the military men, women, and fam-
ilies living and working at Offutt Air Force 
Base; and veterans living in the surrounding 
communities began in the 1940s and support 
for these groups remains unsurpassed to this 
day; and 
Whereas, creative public-private partner-
ships executed in the Omaha metropolitan 
area by economic leaders are some of the 
largest and most relationship with the De-
partment of Defense’s Military Community 
and Family Policy office in a constant effort 
to create laws that support the military per-
sonnel stationed at Offutt Air Force Base 
and their families; and 
Whereas, the Bellevue and Omaha commu-
nities would welcome the additional military 
and civilian personnel, contractors, and fam-
ilies associated with the United States Space 
Command; and 
Whereas, basing the headquarters at Offutt 
Air Force Base would enhance the economy 
of the region by adding approximately one 
thousand four hundred new jobs; and 
Whereas, reestablishing the United States 
Space Command headquarters at Offutt Air 
Force Base would require military construc-
tion improvements, which would create con-
struction and other support jobs, further in-
creasing the economic benefit to the region; 
and 
Whereas, there is widespread bipartisan 
support for hosting the United States Space 
Command Headquarters from federal, state, 
and community leaders who recognize the 
importance of returning the space mission to 
Offutt Air Force Base; and 
Whereas, the space mission is vital to our 
Nation’s security, prosperity, and scientific 
advancement; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the members of the One Hundred 
Seventh Legislature of Nebraska, First Session: 
1. That the Nebraska Legislature does 
hereby express enthusiastic support for the 
United States Air Force to reestablish the 
United States Space Command headquarters 
at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Ne-
braska.

Whereas the SAFE Banking Act of 2019 was 
inserted into sec. 110606 of H.R. 6800, referred 
to as the Heroes Act, which, on May 15, 2020, 
was passed by a bipartisan majority in the 
United States House of Representatives; and 
Whereas sec. 1(b) of the SAFE Banking Act 
of 2019 and sec. 110606(a)(2) of the Heroes Act 
explain that the purpose of each is ‘‘to in-
crease public safety by ensuring access to fi-
nancial services to cannabis-related legiti-
mate businesses and service providers and re-
ducing the amount of cash at such busi-
nesses’’; and 
Whereas the SAFE Banking Act of 2019 and 
the Heroes Act provide, among other protec-
tions, a safe harbor for depository institu-
tions for providing financial services to a 
cannabis-related legitimate business or serv-
ice provider; and 
Whereas the SAFE Banking Act of 2019 and 
the Heroes Act provide that ‘‘[f]or the pur-
poses of sections 1956 and 1957 [money laun-
dering] of title 18, United States Code, and 
all other provisions of Federal law, the pro-
ceeds from a transaction involving activities 
of a cannabis-related legitimate business or 
service provider shall not be considered pro-
ceeds from an unlawful activity solely be-
cause . . . the transaction involves proceeds 
from a cannabis-related legitimate business 
or service provider’’; and 
Whereas the SAFE Banking Act of 2019 and 
the Heroes Act provide that depository insti-
tutions or insurers that provide financial 
services to cannabis-related legitimate busi-
nesses or service providers and the officers, 
directors, and employees of depository insti-
tutions or insurers may not be held liable 
under any federal law or regulation solely 
for providing the financial service or for fur-
ther investing any income derived from the 
financial services; and 
Whereas the SAFE Banking Act of 2019 and 
the Heroes Act do not endorse any state’s, 
district’s, or territory’s specific approach to 
the legalization of cannabis-related trans-
actions and m no way endorse the legaliza-
tion of medical or retail cannabis in jurisdic-
tions hat choose: not to lega1ize medical or 
retail cannabis; and 
Whereas without federal legislation allow-
ing states that have legalized medical or 
adult use of cannabis to bring legal cannabis- 
related commerce into the banking system, 
the tracking of revenue for taxation and reg-
ulatory compliance purposes is more dif-
ficult; and WHEREAS the inability to prop-
erly track the billions of dollars in legal can-
nabis-related sale proceeds compromises the 
safety and soundness of the nation’s finan-
cial system by allowing the unmonitored 
entry of illicit funds into the financial sys-
tem; and 
Whereas the threat to public safety in-
creases with cash-intensive businesses be-
cause cash-intensive businesses are often the 
targets of criminal activity; and 
Whereas the cannabis industry continues 
to grow rapidly; with analysts estimating 
the current industry value at $8,300,000,000, 
projected to increase to $25,000,000,000 by 
2025:and 
Whereas, regardless of policy views on 
states’ permitting the medical or adult use 
of cannabis, the current situation neces-
sitates federal rules that provide for bringing 
legal cannabis-related commerce into the 
banking system; 
Be it Resolved that the Alaska State Legis-
lature urges the federal government to adopt 
the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, sec. 110606 of 
the Heroes Act, or similar legislation that 
would provide a safe harbor for depository 
institutions that provide financial products 
or 
services 
to 
legal 
cannabis-related 
busiesses—r service providers in states that 
have implemented laws and regulations le-
galizing cannabis for medical or adult use. 
Copies of this resolution shall be sent to 
the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, President of 
the United States: the Honorable Lisa Mur-
kowski and the Honorable Dan Sullivan, U.S. 
Senators, and the Honorable Don Young, 
U.S. Representative. members of the Alaska 
delegation in Congress: and all other mem-
bers of the 117th United States Congress. 
POM–78. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan memorializing 
its support for the people of Cuba, and urging 
the President of the United States and the 
United States government to take action to 
protect the basic human rights of the Cuban 
people; to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 78 
Whereas, Communist Miguel Dı´az-Canel 
rose to power in Cuba in 2018 and continues 
to follow the failed policies of Fidel and Rau´ l 
Castro. President Dı´az-Canel’s ascension has 
coincided with an economic crisis that led to 
a heavy-handed and nonsensical shutdown of 
the state-run communication system and 
purposeful electricity outages; and 
Whereas, The Cuban people lack the free-
dom to be in charge of their own destiny and 
future as a result of the systemic and contin-
ued repression they face at the hands of the 
Dı´az-Canal regime; and 
Whereas, A historic and remarkable gath-
ering of protests is occurring in Cuba, where 
everyday Cubans are courageously demand-
ing democracy, liberty, economic security, 
food, and basic medical necessities. Liberty 
in Cuba is defined as not only economic lib-
erty, but also civil liberties. This includes 
the right to vote, liberty of conscience, and 
the right to self-determination. At the heart 
of these protests is the will of Cuban people 
to be in charge of their own destiny; and 
Whereas, Without democracy and free elec-
tions, the welfare of the Cuban people will 
continue to be structurally burdened and 
protests will continue. As the Communist re-
gime continues to deprive the people of Cuba 
of peaceful means to improve their lives, ev-
eryday Cubans will continue to risk their 
lives and well-being to protest openly to de-
mand immediate change; and 
Whereas, Michigan is a state that values 
our best aspirational American ideals of lib-
erty, tolerance, and freedom. These are the 
ideals and values that Cubans march for 
today. The people of Michigan support the 
right of the people of Cuba to peacefully pro-
test to secure basic civil liberties, and stand 
with the people of Cuba in support of their 
quest for democracy, liberty, and freedom; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we declare sup-
port for the people of Cuba in their fight 
against a destructive Communist regime and 
urge the United States government and the 
Biden Administration to take action to pro-
tect the basic human rights of the Cuban 
people; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President of 
the United States Senate, and the members 
of the Michigan congressional delegation. 
POM–79. A concurrent memorial adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the Secretary of the Department of 
the Interior to immediately take all nec-
essary measures to fulfill its obligations to 
provide for Colorado River augmentation and 
conservation; to the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2003 
Whereas, the United States Congress stat-
ed in the Colorado River Basin Project Act 
that the satisfaction of the requirements of 
the Mexican Water Treaty constitutes a na-
tional obligation: and 
Whereas, under a treaty agreement entered 
into in 1973, the United States is required to 
ensure that water delivered to Mexico as 
part of Mexico’s allocation of Colorado River 
water meets certain water quality standards; 
and 
Whereas, the Colorado River system is in 
its twenty-first consecutive year of drought: 
and 
Whereas, as a result of these drought con-
ditions, the United States Department of the 
Interior is projecting that a shortage on the 
Colorado River is increasingly likely; and 
Whereas, in the lower basin drought con-
tingency plan agreement, the United States, 
through the Secretary of the Interior, com-
mitted to take affirmative actions to imple-
ment lower basin programs designed to cre-
ate or conserve 100,000 acre-feet or more per 
year of Colorado River system water to con-
tribute to the conservation of water supplies 
in Lake Mead or other Colorado River res-
ervoirs in the lower basin; and 
Whereas, the Central Arizona Project 
would bear the largest reduction of Colorado 
River water in times of shortage; and 
Whereas, by abdicating its obligation to 
operate the Yuma Desalting Plant, or a suit-
able alternative the federal government has 
caused the loss of more than 1,800,000 acre- 
feet from Lake Mead: and 
Whereas, if the federal government were to 
conserve 100,000 acre-feet per year, it would 
be equivalent to the water needed to supply 
more than 330,000 Arizona homes with water 
annually. 
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of 
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the 
Senate concurring, prays: 
1. That the Secretary of the United States 
Department of the Interior immediately 
take all necessary measures to fulfill its ob-
ligations to provide for Colorado River water 
augmentation and conservation. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the Secretary of the United States De-
partment of the Interior, the President of 
the United States, the President of the 
United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives and 
each Member of Congress from the State of 
Arizona.

September 23, 2021 
commending the agents of the United States 
Border Patrol; to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2029 
Whereas, the southern border consists of 
1,993 miles of varied terrain, including 
deserts, rugged mountainous areas, forests 
and coastal areas; and 
Whereas, officially established in 1924 by 
an act of Congress in response to increasing 
illegal immigration, the United States Bor-
der Patrol has primary responsibility for se-
curing the border between ports of entry: 
and 
Whereas, 
Border 
Patrol 
agents 
patrol 
international land borders and waterways to 
detect and prevent the illegal trafficking of 
people, narcotics and contraband into the 
United States; and 
Whereas, the southern border of the United 
States is experiencing unprecedented num-
bers of individuals attempting to enter the 
country illegally; and 
Whereas, in June 2019, over 100,000 individ-
uals were apprehended at the southern bor-
der, which is an increase of more than 140% 
as compared to June 2018; and 
Whereas, the Border Patrol establishes and 
maintains partnerships with local, state, fed-
eral. tribal and international law enforce-
ment partners, as well as local ranchers and 
other private citizens who own much of the 
land along the southwest border; and 
Whereas, Border Patrol agents work in dy-
namic environments with multiple and var-
ied threats that are constantly changing and 
evolving; and 
Whereas, Border Patrol agents responded 
admirably to the COVID–19 pandemic, effi-
ciently implementing the resulting new poli-
cies and procedures to ensure the safety of 
the public; and 
Whereas, the Border Patrol protects the 
United States against terrorists and instru-
ments of terror; and 
Whereas, created in 2003. the United States 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement 
(ICE) conducts transnational criminal inves-
tigations to identify and interdict myriad 
smuggling and cross-border illegal activity. 
The work of ICE is critical to enforcing im-
migration law against people who present a 
threat to national security, are a danger to 
public safety or undermine the integrity of 
the immigration system: and 
Whereas, demonstrating courage and valor 
in protecting our nation, Border Patrol 
agents serve the American people with vigi-
lance, integrity and professionalism: Now 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring: 
1. That the Members of the Legislature 
commend the courage, dedication and sac-
rifice of the men and women of the United 
States Border Patrol and recognize the vital 
role they play in safeguarding our state and 
nation. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Resolution 
to the President of the United States and 
each Member of Congress from the State of 
Arizona. 
POM–81. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Alaska urging the 
United States Congress to exempt cruise 
ships from certain provisions of the Pas-
senger Vessel Services Act and other appli-
cable provisions of federal law for the period 
during which Canadian ports are closed to 
cruise ships carrying more than 100 people; 
and urging the President of the United 
States not to fine or take actions against 
cruise ships sailing to the state; to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transportation. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 9 
Whereas, more than 2,260,000 visitors trav-
eled to the state in 2019: and 
Whereas, in 2019. approximately 1,331,600 
people visited the state by cruise ship. ac-
counting for 90 percent of the visitors to 
Southeast Alaska: and 
Whereas, each year, the tourism industry 
generates more than $214,000.000 in state and 
municipal revenue, more than $1,400,000,000 
in payroll, and $2,200,000,000 of visitor spend-
ing: and 
Whereas, on average, the tourism industry 
creates 
8,394 
jobs 
annually, 
generating 
$271,600,000 in wages and earnings for South-
east Alaska each year; and 
Whereas, in 2020. the diminished tourism 
season resulting from the COVID–19 pan-
demic contributed to an increase in state-
wide unemployment from 6.2 percent to 11.0 
percent; Southeast Alaska, unemployment 
increased from 4.7 percent to 11.3 percent, 
which equates to a loss of 17 percent of all 
jobs in the region; and 
Whereas, state residents are being vac-
cinated against COVID–19 at the highest rate 
per capita in the country, with 15 percent of 
state residents having been vaccinated; and 
Whereas, on October 30, 2020, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention issued a 
Framework for Conditional Sailing Order, 
which allows cruise ships to resume sailing 
with mitigation plans for crews, passengers, 
and people in port communities and includes 
requirements for increased testing, addi-
tional crew safeguards, simulated voyages, 
and certification of mitigation plans; and 
Whereas, on February 4, 2021, Canada ex-
tended until February 2022 a ban preventing 
cruise ships carrying more than 100 people 
from sailing through Canadian waters; and 
Whereas, 46 U.S.C. 55103 (Passenger Vessel 
Services Act) requires that certain passenger 
vessels that sail from United States ports 
must visit a foreign port before returning to 
a port in the United States; and 
Whereas, an exemption of cruise ships from 
the requirement of visiting a foreign port 
would help mitigate continued job and rev-
enue loss and provide relief to an industry 
with an economic impact that spans across 
every region of the state and employs people 
from Ketchikan to Nome; and 
Whereas, other federal laws may interfere 
with the ability of certain ships to hire and 
retain crews on routes to the state that do 
not include a stop in Canada; and 
Whereas, small business owners, families, 
and young people in the state depend on 
tourism jobs for their livelihoods, and a 
missed cruise season could cause irreparable 
economic harm; 
Be it resolved, that the Alaska State Leg-
islature urges the United States Congress to 
exempt certain cruise ships sailing to the 
state from provisions of the Passenger Vessel 
Services Act and other federal laws that re-
quire cruise ships to stop at a Canadian or 
other foreign port in order to operate in the 
state for the period during which Canadian 
ports are closed to cruise ships carrying 
more than 100 people; and be it 
Further resolved, that, if the United States 
Congress does not exempt cruise ships from 
the requirements of the Passenger Vessel 
Services Act and any other applicable provi-
sions of federal law, the Alaska State Legis-
lature urges the President of the United 
States, to the extent allowed by law, to exer-
cise his authority to allow cruise ships to 
travel directly on round-trip itineraries to 
and from ports in the State of Washington 
and this state while Canadian ports are 
closed to cruise ships. 
Copies of this resolution shall be sent to 
the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, President of 
the United States; the Honorable Kamala D. 
Harris, Vice President of the United States 
and President of the U.S. Senate: the Honor-
able Lisa Murkowski and the Honorable Dan

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
CASSIDY, and Ms. DUCKWORTH): 
S. 2834. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to preserve ac-
cess to rehabilitation innovation cen-
ters under the Medicare program; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, October 
2—9 days from today—is an important 
date in the life of one of the bravest 
people I have ever met. On October 2, 
2005, Army SGT Eric Edmundson was 
on patrol near the Iraq-Syria border 
when a roadside bomb exploded be-
neath his armored vehicle. 
He survived the blast, but went into 
cardiac arrest while awaiting transport 
to an American military hospital in 
Germany. Doctors worked for 30 min-
utes to restore his pulse. They did, but 
Sergeant Edmundson had already suf-
fered severe brain damage from lack of 
oxygen. 
Doctors told his parents that Eric 
would spend the rest of his life in a 
vegetative state and that the best 
thing they could do for him was choose 
a good nursing home. But Eric’s family 
refused to accept that fate for him. 
They searched for the best rehabilita-
tion hospital in America, somewhere 
where Eric could receive the very best 
medical care and make the fullest pos-
sible recovery. 
The hospital they chose was the Shir-
ley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, then 
known by its original name: the Reha-
bilitation Institute of Chicago. 
I visited him there several times. His 
family was always there, right by his 
side. I will never forget the time Eric’s 
dad told me, ‘‘Eric has a present for 
you.’’ I couldn’t imagine what it was. 
Then I watched as that brave soldier 
stood up from his wheelchair and took 
several halting steps. There wasn’t a 
dry eye in the room. 
Six 
months 
after 
he 
arrived, 
I 
watched Eric Edmundson, in his Army 
dress uniform, walk out of that amaz-
ing hospital and into the arms of his 
wife and their 2-year-old daughter. 
I thought of Eric Edmundson and his 
miraculous recovery when I learned 
earlier this month of the death of Dr. 
Joanne Smith, a medical visionary and 
the longtime president and CEO of 
Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. She died at 
home, with her family at her side, after 
battling cancer privately for 5 years. 
She continued to lead Shirley Ryan 
right up to the end. 
Loretta and I offer our condolences 
to her husband of 33 years, Rory 
Repicky, their children, Claire and Mi-
chael, Joanne’s 16 nieces and nephews, 
and her family, colleagues, and friends, 
who are too numerous to count. 
Dr. Joanne Smith was a once-in-a- 
lifetime leader and a national treasure. 
With her brilliance, determination, and 
compassion, she reinvented the field of 
physical medicine and rehabilitation. 
As president and CEO of Shirley Ryan 
AbilityLab, she imagined—and then led 
the drive to create—the world’s first- 
ever ‘‘translational’’ research hospital 
for rehabilitation medicine. She pio-
neered the concept of a cutting-edge 
research facility within a hospital, 
with 
scientists, 
innovators, 
tech-
nologists, and clinicians all working 
together to heal patients. Seeing her 
team work miracles with wounded vet-
erans, injured police officers, or stroke 
survivors made you a believer. 
Joanne Smith originally planned to 
be a nurse but changed her major to 
pre-med after working as a hospital or-
derly. A chance meeting during med-
ical school with a young girl at a free 
health clinic in Detroit changed her 
life—and the future of rehabilitation 
medicine. 
The young girl had had both legs am-
putated because of spina bifida, but she 
had learned to walk using her arms as 
legs and her hands as feet. She was 
happy. But her mother wanted her to 
have a more ‘‘normal’’ appearance, so 
doctors fitted her with a sort of har-
ness that included two prosthetic legs 
and gave her a wheelchair. 
Dr. Smith said it disturbed her to see 
how a once-happy girl became sad and 
less able as a result of a change in her 
appearance to fit society’s biases and 
expectations. She would spend the rest 
of her life working to discover cures 
that made patients more able, not less. 
She came to Shirley Ryan, then 
called the Rehabilitation Institute of 
Chicago, for her residency in 1988, fresh 
out of medical school, and thank good-
ness, she never left. In 2006, a few years 
after earning her MBA from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, she became presi-
dent and CEO. At that point, the hos-
pital had been ranked at the No. 1 re-
habilitation hospital in America by 
U.S. News & World Report for nearly 
two decades. 
If Joanne Smith had done nothing as 
president and CEO except more of the 
same, she would have been at the top of 
her field. But ‘‘more of the same’’ was 
not in her makeup. She resolved to cre-
ate a new model for rehabilitation hos-
pitals—the research institute within 
the hospital—so that new discoveries 
could reach patients in real time. 
The reimagined hospital opened with 
a new name in 2017. Just recently, it 
was ranked as the best rehabilitation 
hospital in the Nation for the 31st year 
in a row, a record unmatched by any 
hospital. 
Physical and rehabilitation medicine 
is a relatively new field of medicine. It 
began after World War II, with doctors 
and researchers searching for ways to 
help injured servicemembers regain as 
much of their abilities as possible. 
Today, advanced rehabilitation hos-
pitals such as Shirley Ryan AbilityLab 
work with children and adults with se-
vere, complex conditions—from trau-
matic brain and spinal cord injuries, to 
amputations or serious birth defects, 
enabling them to live as fully and inde-
pendently as possible. The demand for 
such medical innovations is large and 
growing. 
The partnership at Shirley Ryan of 
brilliant doctors and researchers work-
ing with brave patients has resulted in 
some breathtaking discoveries. In 2006, 
doctors there outfitted a man with a 
prosthetic arm that he could move 
with his thoughts. With his thoughts. 
That surgery—the first of its kind in 
the world—has since helped revolu-
tionize treatment for people who have 
lost limbs. 
More recently, researchers at Shirley 
Ryan created the world’s first manual 
standing wheelchair, that allows users 
to move while seated or standing. 
Shirley Ryan serves more than 50,000 
patients year from nearly every State 
and more than 70 countries. It is mirac-
ulous, but it is not alone. There are a 
handful of rehabilitation innovation 
centers like it in America. These are 
the best of the best, cutting-edge re-
search labs within world-class hos-
pitals that also prioritize training the 
next generation of doctors and healers. 
My friend, Senator CASSIDY of Lou-
isiana, has seen similar miracles at 
TIRR Memorial Hermann, a world- 
class rehabilitation hospital in Hous-
ton, TX, where many people from Lou-
isiana and around the world go for ad-
vanced treatment. 
The discoveries at America’s best re-
habilitation innovations centers are 
revolutionizing medicine, and they are 
reaching people far beyond their own 
walls. But making such discoveries and 
propelling the field of rehabilitation 
medicine forward costs money—more 
money than these nonprofit centers 
can afford on their own. 
That is why, today, Senator CASSIDY 
and I are reintroducing our bipartisan 
proposal to recognize and support some 
of America’s best rehabilitation inno-
vation centers. Our bill does two 
things. First, it directs the Department 
of Health and Human Services to set 
criteria for such ‘‘rehabilitation inno-
vation centers’’ and to share best prac-
tices and teachings from these institu-
tions with health providers throughout 
the Nation and the world. 
Second, our bill directs HHS to study 
whether Medicare’s existing payment 
system is adequate to support the 
groundbreaking treatment, research, 
and medical education that is taking 
place at these hospitals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6677 
September 23, 2021 
When I first introduced this bill in 
2013, I had a different Republican co-
sponsor, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois. 
In 2012, Senator Kirk suffered a stroke 
that left him partly paralyzed and un-
able to walk. A year later, after 
months of grueling work at R.I.C., he 
was able to walk up the 42 steps to this 
Capitol Building. 
In honor of the doctor whose bril-
liance and compassion helped trans-
form the field of physical and rehabili-
tation medicine that led to the aston-
ishing feat and so many others, Sen-
ator Cassidy and I have agreed to re-
name our bill the Dr. Joanne Smith 
Memorial 
Rehabilitation 
Innovation 
Centers Act. 
I will close with this thought from 
another brave person who helped to 
revolutionize rehabilitation medicine. 
Christopher Reeve was America’s Su-
perman in the movies—until he was 
paralyzed from the shoulders down in 
an equestrian accident in 1995. 
During the last decade of his life, he 
regained limited movement in his arms 
and legs. He also spent a great deal of 
time raising awareness of and money 
for the kinds of cutting-edge treat-
ments that are pioneered at institu-
tions such as Shirley Ryan. 
In his last public appearance, he 
spoke at Shirley Ryan. He said, ‘‘It 
gets lonely sometimes to [urge people] 
‘Come on, let’s take reasonable risks. 
Let’s try and be safe—but let’s be bold 
at the same time.’ ’’ 
Christopher Reeve said, ‘‘Doctors 
should take the word ‘impossible’ out 
of their lexicons.’’ 
That courageous, bold optimism—be 
safe, but be bold at the same time—is 
what drove Dr. Joanne Smith and what 
inspires the work at America’s best re-
habilitation centers of innovation. Our 
bipartisan bill, we hope, will help ad-
vance their work. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be print-
ing in the RECORD.

S. RES. 380 
Whereas the Republic of South Sudan be-

Self-Determination of Southern Sudan, in 
which 99 percent of Southern Sudanese vot-

displacement 
of 
approximately 
550,000 refugees and 4,000,000 internally dis-

Sudan 
People’s 
Liberation 
Movement 
(SPLM), erupted into open conflict between 
ethnically allied Dinka and Nuer factions of 
the security services and quickly escalated 
into civil war; 
Whereas, on August 17, 2015, after months 
of mediation by the Intergovernmental Au-
thority on Development, the Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Repub-
lic of South Sudan was signed by President 
Kiir, Riek Machar for SPLM-In Opposition 
(SPLM-IO), and Pagan Amum for SPLM- 
Former Detainees; 
Whereas the parties to the Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Repub-
lic of South Sudan delayed implementation 
of the agreement and demonstrated a lack of 
political will for sustainable peace, and in 
July 2016, civil war returned to South Sudan 
as new clashes in Juba quickly spread 
throughout the country; 
Whereas the Revitalized Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan, signed on September 12, 2018, 
asserted the Parties’ commitment to the per-
manent ceasefire, humanitarian access, and 
respect for human rights, and called for the 
establishment of a Revitalized Transitional 
Government of National Unity to lead South 
Sudan to democratic elections after 44 
months; 
Whereas Kiir’s presidential term has been 
extended 3 times since South Sudan’s inde-
pendence, twice through amendments to the 
Transitional Constitution of South Sudan 
and most recently through an extension of 
the Transitional Period under the Revital-
ized Agreement on the Resolution of the 
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan to 
2023; 
Whereas, despite years of fighting, 2 peace 
agreements, punitive actions by the inter-
national community, and widespread suf-
fering among civilian populations, the lead-
ers of South Sudan show little motivation to 
build sustainable peace, and critical provi-
sions of the Revitalized Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan remain unimplemented; 
Whereas the conflict in South Sudan re-
sulted in the deaths of at least 383,000 people 
from December 2013 to April 2018, according 
to a report by the London School of Hygiene 
and Tropical Medicine, and caused one of the 
worst displacement crises in the world with 
1,600,000 internally displaced persons and 
2,200,000 refugees and asylum seekers in the 
region as of May 2021, according to the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees; 
Whereas South Sudan ranks 185th of 189 
countries in the 2020 Human Development 
Index, performed the worst of 180 countries 
on the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index, is 
perennially one of the most dangerous coun-
tries in which aid workers operate, received 
the lowest ranking in the Department of 
State’s Trafficking in Persons Report every 
year from 2015 to 2021, and has been on the 
Child Soldiers Prevention Act list for 10 
years in a row; 
Whereas the United Nations declared a 
‘‘man-made’’ famine in parts of South Sudan 
in February 2017, and the United Nations Of-
fice for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs stated in March 2021 that ‘‘South 
Sudan is facing its highest levels of food in-
security and malnutrition since independ-
ence ten years ago’’; 
Whereas, in February 2021, the United Na-
tions Commission on Human Rights in South 
Sudan ‘‘found that ten years after independ-
ence, staggering levels of violence continue 
and threaten to spiral out of control across 
several regions in the country’’; 
Whereas the situation in South Sudan per-
sists while its neighbors face increasingly ur-
gent domestic and regional issues, including 
the ongoing political transition in Sudan, 
conflict in Ethiopia, and deeply flawed elec-
toral processes and political unrest in Ugan-
da and Somalia; 
Whereas the United States has been the 
largest donor to South Sudan, providing 
more than $1,800,000,000 in development as-
sistance since independence and more than 
$6,000,000,000 in emergency humanitarian as-
sistance since the start of the civil war in 
December 2013; 
Whereas, on July 9, 2021, the United Na-
tions Mission in South Sudan marked 10 
years in existence at a total cost of more 
than $10,300,000,000, and total United States 
contributions 
are 
estimated 
to 
exceed 
$3,300,000,000 through 2021; 
Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have 
consistently failed to uphold their respon-
sibilities to create the conditions for peace 
and prosperity, have prioritized self-preser-
vation and corruption over the needs of the 
people they represent, have acted in bad 
faith in the implementation of cease-fire and 
peace agreements, and have betrayed the 
cause of freedom, resulting in the loss of mil-
lions of innocent lives; 
Whereas South Sudan has not held an elec-
tion since its independence and the current 
leaders of South Sudan were appointed or in-
stalled through transitional arrangements 
based on peace agreements; 
Whereas South Sudan merits consistent 
high-level attention given the central role 
the United States played in diplomatic ef-
forts leading to the independence of South 
Sudan and the enormous investments in hu-
manitarian and other assistance the United 
States has provided to South Sudan; and 
Whereas, on July 9, 2021, South Sudan cele-
brated the 10th anniversary of its independ-
ence: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reiterates the commitment of the 
United States to helping the people of South 
Sudan realize their aspirations of an inde-
pendent, stable, democratic, and prosperous

(2) calls on the Secretary of State to lead 
a comprehensive interagency process to de-
velop a revitalized United States policy to-
ward South Sudan that— 
(A) identifies a broader range of South Su-
danese political and civilian stakeholders,

(A) to demonstrate renewed United States 
leadership with regard to the United Nations 
Mission in South Sudan to orient the peace-
keeping mission toward increased effective-
ness, clarity of purpose, and eventual draw-

(A) to ensure that United States assistance 
adheres to the principle of ‘‘Do No Harm’’ by 
pausing any funding, including humanitarian 
aid, that is manipulated to legitimize or en-
rich any party to the ongoing conflict; 
(B) to review United States diplomatic en-

publicized; and 
(5) urges the Secretary of the Treasury— 
(A) to prioritize investigative actions into 
illicit financial flows fueling violence in 
South Sudan; 
(B) to work with the Secretary of State to 
add to the list of individuals and entities

Whereas technological innovation can fur-
ther reduce costs and increase deployment of 
clean energy sources; 
Whereas the ‘‘2021 U.S. Energy and Em-
ployment Report’’ published by the Depart-
ment of Energy found that, at the end of 
2020, the energy and energy efficiency sectors 
in the United States employed approxi-
mately 7,500,000 individuals; 
Whereas the scaling of clean energy is es-
sential to reducing emissions; 
Whereas clean energy jobs are inherently 
local, contribute to the growth of local 
economies, and cannot be outsourced due to 
the on-site nature of construction, installa-
tion, and maintenance; and 
Whereas innovative clean energy solutions 
and clean energy jobs are part of the energy 
future of the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) proclaims the week of September 20

GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS 
OF 
RAIL 
SAFETY WEEK TO REDUCE RAIL- 
RELATED 
ACCIDENTS, 
FATALI-
TIES, AND INJURIES 
Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. PETERS, and Mrs. FISCHER) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 382 
Whereas the first Rail Safety Week was 
held from September 24 through September 
30, 2017, by the national education safety 
nonprofit Operation Lifesaver, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and other organiza-
tions; 
Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to 
raise awareness about the need for increased 
education on how to be safe around highway- 
rail grade crossings and railroad tracks and 
to highlight efforts to further reduce colli-
sions, injuries, and fatalities; 
Whereas highway-rail grade crossing and 
trespassing accidents constituted approxi-
mately 96 percent of all rail-related fatali-
ties during 2020; 
Whereas, since 2005— 
(1) the number of public highway-rail grade 
crossings has decreased by 9.8 percent; and 
(2) the number of gates at such crossings 
has increased by 38.1 percent; 
Whereas, in 2020, 47 percent of all highway- 
rail grade crossing collisions and 69 percent 
of all fatal highway-rail grade crossing colli-
sions occurred at gated highway-rail grade 
crossings; 
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics in-
dicate that 1,901 highway-grade crossing col-
lisions occurred in the United States in 2020, 
resulting in 198 deaths and another 685 indi-
viduals injured; 
Whereas many collisions between trains 
and motor vehicles or pedestrians could have 
been prevented by increased education, engi-
neering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost 
public information and education program 
on rail safety, administers a public edu-
cation program about grade-crossing safety 
and trespassing prevention; 
Whereas, during Rail Safety Week, from 
September 20 through 26, and throughout the 
year, everyone is encouraged to take added 
caution as motorists or pedestrians approach 
tracks or trains; 
Whereas the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico will concurrently observe Rail Safety 
Week; and 
Whereas this important observance should 
lead to greater safety awareness and a reduc-
tion in highway-rail grade crossing collisions 
and other railroad incidents: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Rail Safe-
ty Week’’; 
(2) expresses strong support for— 
(A) the goals and ideals of Rail Safety 
Week; and 
(B) efforts to reduce rail-related accidents, 
fatalities, and injuries; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States— 
(A) to participate in Rail Safety Week 
events and activities; and 
(B) to educate themselves and others on 
how to be safe around railroad tracks.

SENATE RESOLUTION 383—DESIG-
NATING THE WEEK BEGINNING 
SEPTEMBER 
12, 
2021, 
AS 
‘‘NA-
TIONAL DIRECT SUPPORT PRO-
FESSIONALS 
RECOGNITION 
WEEK’’ 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. BROWN, Mr. CASEY, Ms. HASSAN, 
Mr. KAINE, Mr. KING, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. 
MARKEY, 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ, 
Ms. 
ROSEN, Ms. SMITH, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, 
and Ms. WARREN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 383 
Whereas direct support professionals, in-
cluding direct care workers, personal assist-
ants, personal attendants, in-home support 
workers, and paraprofessionals, are key to 
providing publicly funded, long-term support 
and services for millions of individuals with 
disabilities; 
Whereas, during the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID– 
19’’) pandemic, many direct support profes-
sionals continue to arrive for work every day 
in order to ensure the health and safety of 
individuals with disabilities; 
Whereas direct support professionals pro-
vide essential services that ensure all indi-
viduals with disabilities are— 
(1) included as a valued part of the commu-
nities in which those individuals live; 
(2) supported at home, at work, and in the 
communities of the United States; and 
(3) empowered to live with the dignity that 
all people of the United States deserve; 
Whereas, by fostering connections between 
individuals with disabilities and their fami-
lies, friends, and communities, direct sup-
port professionals ensure that individuals 
with disabilities thrive, thereby avoiding 
more costly institutional care; 
Whereas direct support professionals build 
close, respectful, and trusting relationships 
with individuals with disabilities and pro-
vide a broad range of personalized support to 
those individuals, including— 
(1) helping individuals make person-cen-
tered choices; 
(2) assisting with personal care, meal prep-
aration, medication management, and other 
aspects of daily living; 
(3) assisting individuals in accessing the 
community and securing competitive, inte-
grated employment; 
(4) providing transportation to school, 
work, religious, and recreational activities; 
(5) helping with general daily affairs, such 
as assisting with financial matters, medical 
appointments, and personal interests; 
(6) assisting individuals in the transition 
from isolated or congregate settings or serv-
ices to living in the communities of their 
choice; and 
(7) helping to keep individuals with disabil-
ities safe and healthy during the COVID–19 
pandemic, including by volunteering to quar-
antine with individuals whom they care for 
to reduce spread of the disease; 
Whereas there is a documented critical and 
increasing shortage of direct support profes-
sionals throughout the United States; 
Whereas the majority of direct support 
professionals are employed in home and com-
munity-based settings, and that trend is ex-
pected to increase over the next decade; 
Whereas 
many 
direct 
support 
profes-
sionals— 
(1) are the primary financial providers for 
their families; 
(2) are hardworking, taxpaying citizens 
who provide a critical service in the United 
States; and 
(3) continue to earn low wages, receive in-
adequate benefits, and have limited opportu-
nities for advancement, resulting in high 
turnover and vacancy rates that adversely 
affect the quality of support, safety, and 
health of individuals with disabilities; and 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 
(1999)— 
(1) recognized the importance of the dein-
stitutionalization of, and community-based 
services for, individuals with disabilities; 
and 
(2) held that, under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. 12101 et seq.), 
a State must provide community-based serv-
ices to individuals with intellectual and de-
velopmental disabilities if— 
(A) the community-based services are ap-
propriate; 
(B) the affected individual does not op-
pose receiving the community-based serv-
ices; and 
(C) the community-based services can be 
reasonably accommodated after the com-
munity has taken into account the re-
sources available to the State and the 
needs of other individuals with disabilities 
in the State: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week beginning Sep-
tember 12, 2021, as ‘‘National Direct Support 
Professionals Recognition Week’’; 
(2) recognizes the dedication and vital role 
of direct support professionals in enhancing 
the lives of individuals with disabilities of 
all ages; 
(3) appreciates the contribution of direct 
support professionals in supporting individ-
uals with disabilities and their families in 
the United States; 
(4) commends direct support professionals 
for being integral to the provision of long- 
term support and services for individuals 
with disabilities; 
(5) encourages the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics of the Department of Labor to collect 
data specific to direct support professionals; 
and 
(6) finds that the successful implementa-
tion of public policies affecting individuals 
with disabilities in the United States can de-
pend on the dedication of direct support pro-
fessionals.

capacity of schools and communities for the 
success of students, families, and commu-
nities; 
Whereas community schools are an effec-
tive, evidence-based, and equity-driven strat-
egy for school improvement included under 
section 4625 of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7275), 
as added by section 4601 of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (Public Law 114–95; 129 Stat. 
2029); 
Whereas community schools that provide 
integrated student supports, well-designed 
and expanded learning opportunities, and ac-
tive family and community engagement and 
that use collaborative leadership and prac-
tices have positive academic and nonaca-
demic outcomes, including improvements in 
student 
attendance, 
behavior, 
academic 
achievement, school readiness, mental and 
physical health, high school graduation 
rates, and school climate and reduced racial 
and economic achievement gaps; 
Whereas community schools have the po-
tential for closing racial and economic 
achievement gaps, as indicated in a 2017 re-
port; 
Whereas a 2020 study found that commu-
nity schools in New York City had a positive 
impact on student attendance, on-time grade 
progression, and credit accumulation for 
high school students; 
Whereas community schools provide a 
strong social return on investment, with one 
study citing a social return of between $10 to 
$15 for every dollar invested over a 3-year pe-
riod; 
Whereas community school coordinators 
are essential to building successful commu-
nity schools and creating, strengthening, 
and maintaining partnerships between com-
munity schools and their communities; 
Whereas community school coordinators 
facilitate and provide leadership for the col-
laborative process and development of a con-
tinuum of supports and opportunities for 
children, families, and others within a 
school’s community that allow all students 
to learn and the community to thrive; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) 
pandemic poses additional academic, social, 
emotional, and health challenges for stu-
dents, educators, and staff at community 
schools; 
Whereas community school coordinators 
have proven to be innovative and resourceful 
in response to the COVID–19 pandemic, in-
cluding through organizing volunteers for 
mobile food pantries, hosting virtual parent 
hangouts and student lunch groups, con-
tinuing to support onsite behavioral health 
programs through an online platform, co-
ordinating vaccination clinics, and mobi-
lizing community completion of the 2020 
Census; 
Whereas community school coordinators, 
through their role, deliver a strong mone-
tary return on investment for community 
schools and their communities, with one 
study citing a return of $7.11 for every dollar 
invested in the salary of a community school 
coordinator; and 
Whereas Community School Coordinators 
Appreciation Week, celebrated from Sep-
tember 20 through September 24, 2021, recog-
nizes, raises awareness of, and celebrates the 
thousands of community school coordinators 
across the country and the critical role of 
community school coordinators in the suc-
cess of students: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 20 
through September 24, 2021, as ‘‘Community 
School Coordinators Appreciation Week’’; 
(2) thanks community school coordinators 
for the work they do to serve students, fami-
lies, and communities, especially as commu-
nities 
continue 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic; and 
(3) encourages students, parents, school ad-
ministrators, and public officials to partici-
pate in events that celebrate Community 
School Coordinators Appreciation Week.

RESOLUTION 
385—SUP-
PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 19 
THROUGH SEPTEMBER 25, 2021, 
AS 
‘‘TELEHEALTH 
AWARENESS 
WEEK’’ 
Mr. 
SCHATZ 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. THUNE, Mr. 
WARNER, and Mrs. HYDE-SMITH) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 385 
Whereas telehealth allows a health care 
practitioner to furnish health care services 
to a patient or a practitioner at a different 
physical location than the health care prac-
titioner; 
Whereas telehealth has played a signifi-
cant role in supporting access to quality 
health care services for millions of patients 
during the COVID–19 public health emer-
gency and will continue to be essential be-
yond the end of the public health emergency; 
Whereas following the unprecedented use 
of telehealth and virtual care services in re-
sponse to the public health emergency, tele-
health now represents a significant percent 
of care delivery, confirming the need to bal-
ance in-person and virtual care in the health 
care system; 
Whereas telehealth and virtual care serv-
ices continue to provide patients and fami-
lies with safe, appropriate, and high-quality 
care where and when they need it, and 91 per-
cent of Medicare beneficiaries are satisfied 
with their telehealth experiences; 
Whereas telehealth allows health care pro-
viders to securely connect with patients 
wherever they are when an in-person inter-
action is not clinically necessary or avail-
able and expands access to health care serv-
ices for patients in need of specialty care, en-
abling the health care system to do more 
good for more people; 
Whereas telehealth is a bipartisan issue 
and Members of Congress from both sides of 
the political aisle and both sides of Capitol 
Hill are dedicated to ensuring patients con-
tinue to have the choice to access telehealth 
once the COVID–19 public health emergency 
ends; 
Whereas the United States must help im-
prove broader access to telehealth services 
for all individuals, including members of 
rural and underserved communities; and 
Whereas ‘‘Telehealth Awareness Week’’ 
unites the efforts of patients, caregivers, 
health care providers, policymakers, and 
other stakeholders to advance the role of 
telehealth in health care: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the des-
ignation of the week of September 19 
through September 25, 2021, as ‘‘Telehealth 
Awareness Week’’.

which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 386 
Whereas Robert B. Dove was born in Belle-
fontaine, Ohio, graduated from The Ohio 
State University, received Masters and PhD 
degrees from Duke University and a juris 
doctor from Georgetown University; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove served the Senate 
with honor and distinction for 35 years, first 
as Assistant Senate Parliamentarian from 
1966 to 1981 and then as its fourth Parliamen-
tarian from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 
to 2001; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove was a patient 
teacher of Senate procedure to countless 
Senators and Senate staff—young and old 
like—whom he helped navigate the Cham-
ber’s rules and procedures; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove imparted his vast 
knowledge of the Senate and of history to 
others with infectious enthusiasm and good 
humor; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove was known for his 
love of music of all kinds and could readily 
recall, and sing, a song to fit any occasion; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove followed his illus-
trious Senate career with an equally distin-
guished teaching career at Georgetown and 
George Washington universities, sharing his 
love of history, political science and the Sen-
ate with yet another generation of scholars; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove’s love for the Sen-
ate was exceeded only by his love for his 
adorning family, many of whom, inspired by 
him, also served the Senate; 
Whereas Robert B. Dove performed his 
Senate duties in an impartial and profes-
sional manner, serving the Senate with dis-
tinction across four decades and for which he 
was honored by the Senate in 1997 with the 
title Parliamentarian Emeritus: Now, there-

HON. JIM COSTA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

of Arkansas where he majored in journalism 
and wrote for the school paper, which in 1979 
landed him a job as a reporter for the Arkan-
sas Democrat. While in Little Rock, Mr. Morse 
met Cindy Robertson, who he would later go 
on to marry. 
In 1981, Mr. Morse moved to Washington, 
D.C. to work as a Press Secretary and Legis-
lative Aide to Congressman Bob Whittaker, 
beginning his career in politics and public 
service. After a couple of years in Washington, 
Mr. Morse decided to follow in his father’s 
footsteps and moved to Sacramento to attend 
the University of the Pacific McGeorge School 
of Law, which he attended with his wife Cindy. 
While in law school, he continued his public 
service, working as the Communications Di-
rector for the Senate Democratic Caucus and 
after earning his J.D., as Legislative Director 
for State senator Milton Marks. 
Mr. Morse began his work as a trial attorney 
in 1993 when he moved to Merced to work as 
a member of the Merced County District Attor-
ney’s office, where he quickly rose through the 
ranks and in 1998 was appointed as the Chief 
Deputy District Attorney. In 2006, Mr. Morse 
was elected as the Merced County District at-
torney. 
Mr. Morse’s time as District Attorney was 
his biggest source of professional pride. Dur-
ing his tenure, he personally prosecuted the 
most cases out of his counterparts in many 
counties, including almost 20 murder cases. 
Additionally, he started the Violence Interrup-
tion and Prevention and Emergency Response 
(VIPER) program to marshal law enforcement 
intelligence resources to provide better infor-
mation to officers on patrols and in investiga-
tions. After serving as the Merced County DA, 
Mr. Morse continued his public service as the 
Legislative Director for the California District 
Attorneys Association. 
As one who was always civically engaged, 
Mr. Morse was a member of Merced Elks 
Lodge 1240, Los Banos Sportsman’s Associa-
tion, E Clampus Vitus, and founding member 
of the Merced Boys and Girls Club. Most nota-
bly, he played a vital role on the committee 
that brought a University of California campus 
to Merced. 
Mr. Morse loved spending time with his fam-
ily and was a devoted husband, father, and 
grandfather. He enjoyed traveling with his wife 
of 35 years Cindy and sons Dylan, Ethan, and 
Ryan, instilling ‘‘The Golden Rule’’ and a love 
of reading music. After Ethan’s tragic death, 
he was comforted having his granddaughter 
Ava along with family and friends over to his 
house, which was a sanctuary to him and his 
family. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in honoring a skilled prosecutor, public 
servant, family man, and leader whose con-
tributions to the greater Merced community 
and State of California will be remembered for 
generations. It is both fitting and appropriate 
that we honor him as family, friends, and com-
munity leaders gather to celebrate the life of a 
man who made Merced County a better place. 
CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
KIDSMATTER, 
NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and recognize the 20th Anniversary 
of the Naperville Illinois KidsMatter Organiza-
tion. 
Since 2001, KidsMatter has served to de-
velop and empower young people of all races, 
ethnicities, and economic backgrounds. Their 
work has been critical to understanding how a 
child’s upbringing and environment can affect 
their development. 
More importantly, they recognize that the 
obstacles faced by young adults do not deter-
mine their future. Through mental health serv-
ices, tutoring and leadership academies, and 
many other services, KidsMatter is leading our 
community’s 
children 
to 
brighter 
futures 
ahead. 
In 
addition 
to 
serving 
young 
adults, 
KidsMatter provides critical resources to fami-
lies and parents. This influential organization 
is building a healthy and resilient new genera-
tion, and I look forward to the work they will 
continue doing in the years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring KidsMatter for their exemplary 
service to the people of Naperville, Illinois and 
the surrounding area, and to congratulate 
them on their 20th Anniversary.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF HARRY 
DAVID JANSOHN 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Harry David Jansohn of Vir-
ginia Beach. 
Harry ‘‘Dave’’ passed away peacefully in his 
sleep on September 18, 2021 at the age of 64 
years. Harry was born in Washington, D.C. on 
May 19, 1957 and raised in Annandale, Vir-
ginia by his parents, Harry and Janice 
Jansohn, beside his two sisters, Gloria and 
Karen and his brother, Matthew. Dave grad-
uated from WT Woodson high school where 
he was an honor student and also a first chair 
trumpet player in his school’s orchestra. 
In addition to his parents and siblings, Dave 
is survived by his wife, Deana and two sons, 
Kurt and Connor. Dave was retired from his 
job at NOAA as a Port Engineer in Norfolk, VA 
which was a job he loved. He was well 
thought of and respected by his coworkers at 
NOAA. His NOAA work colleagues visited him 
on a regular basis the last 10 years while he 
was living in nursing homes. They loved bring-
ing him his favorite treats, beer and chocolate

chip cookies. His childhood friends, Tim and 
Vince Laria and college friend, Lee Daniels 
were also frequent visitors over the years 
which made Dave very happy. His friend 
Jesse Bacon was also someone who was a 
big supporter of Dave when he became ill. 
Dave was previously employed by the Mari-
time Administration as a Marine Surveyor 
which was also a job he loved. Dave’s true 
passion was deep sea fishing out of Oregon 
Inlet and Hatteras, NC. He was known for his 
ability to always find the Tuna and Marlin on 
fishing trips. After high school and through col-
lege he worked as a mate on charter boats 
there. He attended Virginia Tech, where he 
earned a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical En-
gineering. Dave also earned the Professional 
Engineer designation by passing the exam on 
his first try. During his High School years he 
achieved the highest honor in scouting, Eagle 
Scout, which he was very proud of. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to rise with me 
in memory of Mr. Harry David ‘‘Dave’’ Jansohn 
and in thanking the Jansohn family for his in-
credible sacrifices, devotion, and service to 
our Nation; words cannot express our grati-
tude.

KIMBERLY SEREFF 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kimberly Sereff of the 
American Federation of Government Employ-
ees on her retirement. 
For thirty years, Kimberly has tirelessly 
served the Federal government within multiple 
agencies and across a variety of positions. 
Kimberly started her public service career as 
a Federal Investigator with the Office of Per-
sonal Management. Three years later, she 
took a position conducting compliance inves-
tigations for the U.S. Department of Labor. 
After eight years of service, she moved to the 
U.S. Department of Housing where she was 
recognized with the Award of Excellence pre-
sented by the Secretary of HUD for her assist-
ance during Hurricane Katrina disaster relief 
efforts in 2006. Her hard work and dedication 
to public service is tremendous. 
In addition to her service to the Federal gov-
ernment, Kimberly has been very active with 
the Big Brothers, Big Sisters organization. In 
2011 and 2012 she was awarded by the orga-
nization for her volunteer and mentoring ef-
forts. I have had the opportunity to meet with 
Kimberly on several occasions and I have 
been inspired by her work ethic and contribu-
tions to our community. 
I wish Kimberly all the best in retirement 
and send gratitude for her service to our com-
munity, the State of Colorado, and the United 
States of America.

CONGRATULATING 
OCEAN 
OF 
LOVE ON THEIR 23RD ANNUAL 
BILLBOARD RADIOTHON 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Ocean of Love on 
their 23rd Annual Billboard Radiothon. As 
September is Childhood Cancer Awareness 
month, it is imperative that we rededicate our-
selves to finding a cure for childhood cancers 
that impact thousands of families across my 
district. 
During this three day event, Ocean of Love 
for Children with Cancer has a goal of raising 
$109,000 so they can continue their mission of 
providing excellent support to families facing 
unimaginable challenges. 
Founded in 1988, Ocean of Love has 
helped over 500 families by providing varying 
levels of support including grocery gift cards, 
household expense assistance, scholarships, 
and caretaker support. Ocean of Love is there 
to share in the celebration of winning the bat-
tle and provides invaluable support for families 
facing life’s hardest tragedy—the loss of a 
child. Through their bereavement group both 
for parents and siblings, Ocean of Love is 
there to stand shoulder to shoulder with 
Ocean County families. 
I commit to them and to families across my 
district that I will continue supporting efforts to 
increase research into childhood disease and 
continue fighting for environmental protections 
to protect children’s health for generations to 
come. I would like to commend Ocean of Love 
for their tireless efforts on behalf of these fam-
ilies and wish them all the best with their 
Radiothon. Thank you for being there to let 
the families here in Ocean County know that 
they will never be in this fight alone.

RECOGNIZING JONATHON CLARK 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Jonathon Clark, an outstanding 
resident and community advocate in Michi-
gan’s 13th Congressional District. 
Jonathon Clark was known for his unwaver-
ing commitment to helping others in need and 
ministering to the spiritual needs of those who 
knew him. In 2019, Mr. Clark accepted his call 
to preach and did so many times from the pul-
pit at City Covenant Church in Detroit, where 
he quickly became a fixture in church leader-
ship. From this place of faith, Mr. Clark dem-
onstrated by example what a man should be. 
Whether tending to his beautiful family with 
whom he was gifted upon his marriage to 
Dawn Wilson-Clark, cooking gourmet meals at 
home or for a hundred at church, or giving his 
talents to a number of community works, he 
was a man who was always aware of the 
great responsibility we each hold to be good 
towards one another and of his role in the big-
ger role in God’s plan. 
Jonathon was beloved by community mem-
bers of all ages. He was a caring mentor to 
young people and he never shied away from 
offering a helping hand. Jonathon always fol-
lowed through on any task he set his mind to. 
Young people loved him because of his direct 
honesty and unmasked concern for them. He 
served in many roles in various community- 
based organizations, including Chair of the 
Board for 482forward, board member of The 
Brightmoor Alliance, Brightmoor Soup, and he 
was the coordinator for summer camp at City 
Covenant, where he founded Talking is 
Teaching, an early children’s literacy program, 
and he served as assistant director of the 
work experience program at Loyola High 
School. Jonathon’s work in the community has 
touched the lives of many. In his advocacy on 
behalf of his neighbors in the Brightmoor com-
munity of Detroit, he was fearless in standing 
up for his community. 
Please join me in recognizing Jonathon 
Clark’s outstanding contributions to the com-
munities of Detroit and Michigan’s 13th Con-
gressional District, as we honor his memory.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
JOHANNY ROSARIO PICHARDO 
HON. LORI TRAHAN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor 
the 
memory 
of 
Marine 
Sergeant 
Johanny Rosario Pichardo, a daughter of Law-
rence, Massachusetts. She and twelve other 
brave American servicemembers tragically lost 
their lives on Thursday, August 26th at the 
Abbey Gate of the Hamid Karzai International 
Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
Sergeant Rosario Pichardo will be remem-
bered as a hero for her valiant service and 
commitment to protecting the freedoms and 
values that all Americans hold dear. This trag-
ic loss serves as a reminder that when our 
troops bravely volunteer to serve, both they 
and their loved ones sacrifice more than we 
can ever imagine. My heart goes out to Ser-
geant Rosario Pichardo’s family and friends 
during this difficult time. 
Sergeant Rosario Pichardo’s legacy lives on 
through the many people who carry her mem-
ory forward. In particular, the residents of Law-
rence, especially those who knew her well, will 
remember her passion for service and her 
commitment to family. 
I am grateful for heroes like Sergeant 
Johanny Rosario Pichardo who volunteer to 
risk everything to make the United States and 
the world a better place and are prepared to 
give what President Lincoln called the ‘‘last full 
measure of their devotion.’’ We are incredibly 
fortunate that such brave men and women are 
among us. 
Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo and her 
fellow servicemembers represented the very 
best our country has to offer. They will never 
be forgotten.

EQUAL ACCESS TO THE RIGHT NU-
TRITION FOR MILITARY FAMI-
LIES ACT (EARN ACT) 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
today, my colleague, Mr. FORTENBERRY of Ne-
braska, and I will introduce the bipartisan 
Equal Access to the Right Nutrition Act for 
Military Families—better known as the EARN 
Act. 
The food insecurity rate among active-duty 
military families is 14 percent higher than the 
national average of 10.5 percent. 
This affects service members from all ranks, 
especially junior enlisted as well as service 
members of color. 
The EARN Act is an innovative solution to 
this problem that will increase military family 
access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program—commonly known as Foods 
Stamps or SNAP. 
It removes variability in state administered 
SNAP programs by establishing a federally 
administered SNAP benefit for military families 
with streamlined national eligibility require-
ments for military households. 
It encourages participation in SNAP by re-
quiring the U.S. Department of Defense to no-
tify qualifying military families of their eligibility 
and automatically enroll families in the pro-
gram unless they decide to opt out. 
Finally, it eases the transition back to civil-
ian life by establishing a transitional, tem-
porary SNAP benefit for those leaving service. 
When a person makes the commitment and 
sacrifice to serve our country in the military, 
we must honor this by ensuring that their 
basic needs are met. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan bill.

IN RECOGNITION OF 9/11 ARTICLE 
BY JAMES PATTERSON 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize this article by James 
Patterson that originally appeared in The 
Montgomery Advertiser, September 9, 2016: 
[From the Montgomery Advertiser, 
September 9, 2016] 
ALABAMIAN RECALLS SEPT. 11, 2001 
(By Jim Patterson, Alabama Voices) 
Sept. 11, 2001, began like many busy morn-
ings for me. I was in my Washington office 
and ready to leave for an appointment with 
a colleague near Georgetown University. 
Later, I had a meeting on Capitol Hill and 
after that, I planned to take Amtrak to Penn 
Station in New York. 
Moments before I left the office, a radio 
news presenter said a plane had hit the 
World Trade Center in New York. This news 
astonished me! I stopped to hear more. While 
I waited for news, I reasoned a small aircraft 
with an amateur pilot could have hit one of 
the Twin Towers. 
As a longtime traveler to New York, col-
leagues had told me stories of pilots in small 
planes that had hit tall apartment buildings. 
This happens in New York. I proceeded to 
leave for my appointment. 
The radio presenter then said a commer-
cial jet had flown into the World Trade Cen-
ter. This boggled my mind as I knew jets did 
not fly so low as to hit the World Trade Cen-
ter. It had to be a hoax, I assumed. 
When the radio presenter said the image 
was on the network news, I had to see it for 
myself. I was stunned to see billowing black 
smoke from the North Tower. An incredible 
pilot error, I thought. I thought perhaps the 
pilot died in the cockpit and lost control of 
the airliner causing it to crash into the 
tower. Still, I had doubts as I stood speech-
less watching the horrible images. 
Within a few minutes, I witnessed a second 
airliner crash in the South Tower. It was a 
day of unspeakable events and lost friends. 
Shortly after 9:30 that morning, the windows 
in my office, situated near the John F. Ken-
nedy Center for the Performing Arts, rattled. 
I looked out the window and saw black 
smoke billowing in the distance from Vir-
ginia. Nearly 200 people died at the Pentagon 
that morning. 
President George W. Bush was in Florida 
that morning with Vice President Dick Che-
ney in the White House. Members of Con-
gress were evacuated to safety. Cheney de-
cided to stay in The White House and issued 
military orders to shoot down any plane out 
of its flight path. Washington DC was a war 
zone! 
Federal employees were ordered home. 
Military and National Guard troops quickly 
appeared to safeguard property and citizens. 
In a short time, the highways leaving Wash-
ington DC became clogged with cars. Many 
vehicles ran out of gas. Stranded motorists 
walked away from their cars. Washington’s 
Metrorail was closed in several directions. 
Washington’s 
mayor 
ordered 
businesses 
closed and residents to stay indoors. 
Being a brave Alabama sort, I decided to 
go for a walk down a deserted Pennsylvania 
Avenue at around 10:30 a.m. I saw no cars 
and no people. A military vehicle with troops 
passed me by. Relieved they did not arrest 
me, I awkwardly waved at them. Two troops 
awkwardly waved in response. 
In an episode of the 1960s TV program The 
Twilight Zone called ‘‘Time Enough at Last’’ 
a middle-aged bank teller longs for a life 
where he can read without the distraction of 
work. When he accidentally gets locked 
overnight in a bank vault and exits the next 
morning to find his town destroyed by ter-
rorists, he is alone in the world. 
As I disobeyed U.S. government orders to 
stay inside my office, I casually walked down 
a deserted Pennsylvania Avenue. I felt I was 
alone in the world. Perhaps this was the last 
walk I would ever make if more terrorism by 
commercial airliner took me away. 
I stopped at a neighborhood restaurant to 
see a sign on the door. ‘‘Closed. Go home,’’ it 
read. I walked to a barbershop and saw men 
inside fearful to wave back at me. 
I saw fear on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. 
I saw confusion. I wondered when it would be 
over. Fifteen years on, the threat of ter-
rorism is not over. It is, sadly, a fact of life 
for all Americans everywhere in the world. 
James Patterson, a former U.S. diplomat, 
is a writer and speaker based in Washington, 
D.C., and a life member of the Auburn Uni-
versity Alumni Association.

After graduating from King’s, P.J. began his 
career as an educator at St. Cecilia’s Junior 
High School in Exeter, Pennsylvania. He then 
joined the teaching staff at the Wyoming Area 
School District where he held several edu-
cational positions during his tenure. 
P.J. is actively involved in many community 
organizations and he has dedicated his time to 
serve in leadership roles. He is a former presi-
dent of the Greater Pittston Friendly Sons. He 
is also a member of the Knights of Columbus 
John F. Kennedy Council No. 372 where he 
previously held the position of Grand Knight. 
P.J. is known for his love of Pittston, and his 
presence has been a mainstay in the commu-
nity for generations. Always seeing the poten-
tial of his beloved hometown, he served his 
community and fellow citizens as a Pittston 
City councilman. He was instrumental in start-
ing the Pittston Tomato Festival, an event that 
attracts thousands of visitors downtown annu-
ally, and he was part of the effort to bring the 
statue of President John F. Kennedy to Ken-
nedy Boulevard in the city. In 2019, P.J. was 
unanimously chosen by the Parade Committee 
to serve as Grand Marshal for the Pittston St. 
Patrick’s Day Parade. 
I am honored to join with the Greater 
Pittston Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in recog-
nizing P.J. as the recipient of the 2021 
Achievement Award. I admire P.J’s lifetime of 
dedication to the Greater Pittston area, and I 
wish him all the best.

Shults Auto Group is the largest auto group 
in the Southern Tier. They have six dealer-
ships carrying twelve different makes of vehi-
cles and three pre-owned resale centers. The 
dealerships are located in Jamestown, Lake-
wood, Olean, and Dunkirk, New York and in 
Warren, Pennsylvania and they employ over 
three hundred people. 
Shults Auto Group has an extensive history 
in the City of Jamestown. In 1970, Edmond R. 
Shults and Donald A. Gage bought controlling 
interest in, what was, Berglund Chevrolet. In 
1971, Mr. Shults purchased Mr. Gage’s inter-
est and the dealership became Ed Shults 
Chevrolet, Inc. In 1981, brothers Edmond R. 
Shults, Jr. and Tim M. Shults purchased Ed 
Shults Chevrolet, Inc., and Shults Auto Group 
has continued to grow. 
Community is extremely important to the 
Shults Family and Shults Auto Group employ-
ees. They have taken a vested interest in 
community events, infrastructure, and vol-
unteerism. Shults Auto Group’s philanthropic 
interests include youth sports, education, the 
National Comedy Center, Northwest Arena, 
and more. They believe in giving back to sup-
port their community. 
The customer experience is also very impor-
tant, and the center of their mission, at Shults 
Auto Group. Millions of dollars have been in-
vested using local contractors and supplies 
over the years to enhance facilities, grow the 
company. and give their customers the great-
est experience. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
recognize the fiftieth anniversary of Shults 
Auto Group in Jamestown, New York. Con-
gratulations on this tremendous milestone.

HONORING ST. ANN CATHOLIC 
CHURCH 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor St. Ann Catholic Church in 
Warsaw, Missouri, which has provided a place 
for the Catholic community in the town to 
gather and worship for over 75 years. On 
March 3, 1946, St. Ann’s was dedicated by 
Bishop O’Hara from the Diocese of Kansas 
City, and the first mass was performed by Fr. 
Urban Landoll from the Society of the Pre-
cious Blood. 
The original church, known as the ‘‘sheep 
shed’’, was a small building for a small parish, 
but since then, the parish has flourished and 
built larger facilities, including a parish hall 
which was finished in 1984, to accommodate 
the increased growth of their church family. 
The parish and their new Pastor, Fr. Ben 
Nwosu, welcome everyone from the commu-
nity to join in mass and celebrate the Lord. 
The Church will have their anniversary cele-
bration on Sunday, September 26th. 
Congratulations to St. Ann’s Church for con-
tributing to the Warsaw area for 75 years. May 
the Lord continue to bless them as they enrich 
the Warsaw community for many years to 
come.

year’s Tokyo Paralympic Games. 
Jaleen Roberts attended Kent-Meridian High 
School where she competed in the ambulatory 
races at the Washington State track meet. 
Born with cerebral palsy, Jaleen trained and 
excelled in sports such as soccer, wrestling, 
and gymnastics. 
As a result of her perseverance and 
athleticism, she was named to the U.S. 2020 
Paralympics Track and Field National Team. 
In both her events, the long jump and 100- 
meter dash, Jaleen earned silver medals and 
set new U.S. records. Her accomplishments 
are a testament to her hard work, commit-
ment, and intense training she completed to 
arrive in Tokyo. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize 
Jaleen’s incredible representation of our coun-
try, our state, and Washington’s Ninth Con-
gressional District on the world stage.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF TAYLOE 
MURPHY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember one of my constituents and 
a special Virginian, The Honorable W. Tayloe 
Murphy of Westmoreland County. Tayloe Mur-
phy passed away on Wednesday, September 
15, 2021 at the age of 88. 
A statesman and conservationist, Tayloe will 
long be remembered for his service to the 
Commonwealth 
and 
the 
Northern 
Neck. 
Tayloe represented the 99th District as a 
member of the Virginia General Assembly 
from 1982 to 2000. As Delegate, Murphy’s 
legislative accomplishments include numerous 
efforts championing a healthy Chesapeake 
Bay, including passage of the Chesapeake 
Bay Preservation Act in 1986. Appointed by 
then-Governor MARK
WARNER, Mr. Murphy 
served as Secretary of Natural Resources, 
where he continued to advance measures pro-
tecting the Bay and preserving the Common-
wealth’s natural resources for future genera-
tions. 
In addition to a life of public service, he also 
dedicated his time to improving the community 
in any way he could. Tayloe sat on multiple 
community boards. Most notably, he spent 
fifty-five years serving community banks in a 
variety of roles, including Vice Chairman with 
Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation. Pre-
ceded in death by his wife Helen of 63 years, 
the Murphy’s were active in the Episcopal 
Churches of Couple Parish and greatly con-
tributed to historical preservation and edu-
cation at Francis Lightfoot Lee’s Menokin and 
Westmoreland State Park. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the life and legacy of Tayloe Murphy, 
a true Virginia Gentleman. On behalf of Amer-
ica’s First District, we say thank you.

HONORING THE GLADYS PORTER 
ZOO 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the outstanding work and lasting impact 
of the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas 
as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary. Since 
its opening in 1971, the Gladys Porter Zoo 
has served as a pillar of the community, com-
mitted to the preservation of nature through 
research, conservation, and education. 
The founder of the zoo, Gladys Porter, was 
an active philanthropist responsible for admin-
istering the funds established by her father’s 
foundation, the Earl C. Sams Foundation. In 
the 1960s, Gladys and her husband Dean en-
joyed traveling the world. Their love of trav-
eling led to a passion and appreciation for na-
ture and wildlife. As the vision for a zoo in the 
Rio Grande Valley came to fruition, Gladys 
and members of the Sams 
Foundation 
planned the project. Mrs. Porter was highly in-
volved in the process of the zoo’s planning, 
construction, stocking, and equipping. Upon 
the Gladys Porter Zoo’s completion, it was 
given to the City of Brownsville by the Sams 
Foundation. 
The opening of the zoo was met with critical 
acclaim. In 1972, the zoo published its first 
newsletter entitled the ‘Zoo News’. The news-
letter is still circulated as a quarterly publica-
tion and provides zoo members updates on 
the animals. In light of the energy crisis in 
1974, the zoo launched the ‘‘Adopt-an-Animal’’ 
program. This program is still widely popular 
today and encourages school groups, families, 
and individuals to ‘‘adopt’’ an animal, and fi-
nancially support it for a year. In 1978, the zoo 
expanded its community education efforts by 
starting summer-study programs. These pro-
grams are focused on providing students with 
a hands-on learning experience through face- 
to-face engagement with the animals, indoor 
overnight camping, night tours of the zoo, and 
internship opportunities. The program has 
since grown in enrollment and is now offered 
to all youth grades K–12 in the spring, sum-
mer, and fall. These examples exemplify the 
zoo’s continued commitment to public service 
and community engagement. 
In addition to the zoo’s involvement with the 
community, the Gladys Porter Zoo has re-
markably carried out its conservation mission 
by contributing to various projects focused on 
preserving endangered species. Joint ventures

between the zoo staff and Mexican authorities 
in the conservation efforts of the rare 
Coahuilan box turtle and Atlantic Ridley sea 
turtle led to recognition from both the United 
States and Mexican government. The zoo has 
also contributed to preservation efforts of en-
dangered and threatened species including, 
the Western lowland gorillas, Philippine croco-
diles, and Rhino hornbills. Over the years, the 
Gladys Porter Zoo has contributed funds to 
projects that specifically focus on animals in 
need of attention. These contributions include 
funding to Dr. Edward Louis, Jr. in support of 
his work with Galapagos tortoises, and the 
International Iguana Foundation, which ac-
tively works to conserve iguanas and their 
habitats. 
Madam Speaker, the Gladys Porter Zoo is a 
cultural staple for the Rio Grande Valley, while 
also serving the world of wildlife preservation, 
zoology, research, and education in countless 
ways. For 50 years, the Gladys Porter Zoo 
has proven to be a world-class zoological and 
botanical park through its exceptional work in 
wildlife preservation, research, education, and 
the community. I congratulate them on reach-
ing this 50-year milestone; and for their contin-
ued efforts to support and educate the South 
Texas community on the need for conserva-
tion and preservation of our wildlife and plan-
et.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, my 
amendment directs the Army Corps of Engi-
neers to provide uniform guidance and to 
strengthen enforcement of laws that are al-
ready on the books to ensure that federal con-
struction projects, particularly on our military 
bases, are completed with the highest quality 
workmanship. 
The 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(GAO)—the federal government’s ‘‘watchdog’’ 
agency—recently completed an investigative 
report, mandated by an amendment I authored 
as part of the 2020 National Defense Author-
ization Act (NDAA), that found inconsistencies 
with implementation of the Corps mechanisms 
for compliance with important worker protec-
tion laws. Today’s amendment addresses 
those problems and instructs the Corps’ to 
fully comply with relevant federal laws and 
regulations for: building quality facilities—labs, 
hangars, housing, and workspaces—for our 
military men and women; providing an honest 
wage for construction workers; and providing 
the best investment for the taxpayer. 
For years, we have witnessed unscrupulous 
contractors win construction bids for critical 
federal work, only to have those important 
projects mismanaged, understaffed, delayed, 
left unfinished, and in some cases, rebid— 
then properly redone by high-skilled trades-
men and women who should have gotten the 
job in the first place. 
There is wide-spread concern that irrespon-
sible contractors and subcontractors hire un-
qualified or underqualified workers and put 
them in high-skill jobs for which they lack the 
needed training and expertise—a practice 
known as misclassification. 
There 
are 
two 
different 
types 
of 
misclassification: craft misclassification and 
independent contractor misclassification. Craft 
misclassification occurs when dishonest con-
tractors misclassify high-skilled workers as 
general laborers or lower wage classifications 
in order to avoid paying the higher prevailing 
wage rate applicable to the high-skilled work 
actually performed. Independent contractor 
misclassification 
occurs 
when 
contractors 
misclassify employees as independent con-
tractors to avoid paying prevailing wages 
thereby reducing labor costs and avoiding 
state and federal taxes. 
These practices deny workers of their rights 
to critical benefits and protections, including 
prevailing wages, worker’s compensation and 
unemployment insurance, and communities 
suffer because misclassification results in 
lower tax revenues for federal, state, and local 
governments. 
Additionally, the end product is often com-
promised by shoddy workmanship which can 
lead to do-overs and substantial cost over-
runs. 
Congress has passed laws to prevent such 
problems and punish the offenders. The 
Davis-Bacon Act is critical in this effort as it 
requires contractors working on certain feder-
ally funded construction projects to pay their 
workers a prevailing wage to ensure that our 
federal projects are completed by skilled work-
ers who have been properly trained, classified 
and paid according to their expertise and lo-
cality. The Act stands as a check and balance 
designed to protect employees from low-wage, 
low-bidding contractors who look to do the job 
on the cheap hurting the workers and the cli-
ent, i.e. the federal taxpayer. 
When it comes to domestic construction 
projects, the Army Corps of Engineers, pro-
cures more than most divisions of the Depart-
ment of Defense. According to the GAO, in 
2019, the Corps obligated over $11 billion for 
domestic construction contracts. 
Each federal agency is primarily responsible 
for enforcing the Davis-Bacon protections at 
its construction worksites. The Army Corps 
has a lot of construction projects and federal 
construction monies to properly oversee. 
Unfortunately, federal construction projects 
in my district, including Army Corps projects at 
Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst—have fall-
en short in oversight and compliance and 
have run into trouble with unqualified, subpar 
bidders who avoid hiring needed skilled work-
ers. We have seen cases of sophisticated 
work—HVAC, plumbing and sheet metal— 
needing to be ripped up and redone after the 
irresponsible bidders failed to properly do the 
work. 
To examine this problem and find lasting so-
lutions, in 2019, Congress enacted my amend-
ment to the 2020 NDAA directing the GAO to 
study the contracting practices of the Corps 
with a focus on how the Corps monitors and 
enforces the Davis-Bacon Act. 
The GAO conducted its audit from May 
2020 to March 2021 examining Corps guid-
ance, relevant documents about the Davis- 
Bacon Act, Department of Labor guidance and 
other relevant laws and regulations. They con-
ducted ‘‘semistructured interviews’’ in four 
Army Corps district offices—Louisville, New 
Orleans, New York and Walla Walla—based 
on the district’s activities and representing 
‘‘various geographical areas in the U.S. and a 
mixture of volume and type of construction 
contracts (e.g. military and civil projects)’’. 
They interviewed Corps headquarters offi-
cials, DOL officials and four external groups 
including two labor unions and two trade asso-
ciations. 
The GAO said that ‘‘monitoring, including 
payroll reviews and on-site inspections, are 
key to ensuring that the Corps enforces con-
tractor’s compliance with the Davis-Bacon 
Act’’. 
But the report also described implementa-
tion inconsistencies across the various districts 
that can easily lead to gaps in compliance with 
Davis-Bacon. 
The GAO concluded that aspects of the re-
views and on-site inspections ‘‘may not be suf-
ficient.’’ They found that ‘‘Corps documents 
lack information’’ and said that ‘‘In the ab-
sence of directions to consistently document 
on-the-ground conditions, like the number of 
employees on site’’ district officials ‘‘may not 
be fully using on-site inspection to ensure con-
tractors’ compliance with the Act.’’ 
GAO’s final recommendations to Army 
Corps were that Corps headquarters provide 
clarifying information on how to conduct pay-
roll reviews and document on-site inspections 
to ensure the proper monitoring of the number 
of workers and work performed. 
In essence, the GAO found that the Army 
Corps needs to do a better job in complying 
with and enforcing Davis-Bacon protections on 
Corps’ projects. 
My amendment instructs the Army Corps to 
provide each of its districts with the guidance 
it needs to enforce Davis-Bacon. It also directs 
the Corps to investigate worker complaints 
and third-party complaints within 30 days of fil-
ings and reaffirms transparency and disclosure 
requirements for certified payroll reports. 
With better compliance and more trans-
parency, we will see better workmanship, and 
a greater return for the taxpayer.

RECOGNIZING PRIME MINISTER OF 
INDIA 
MODI’S 
VISIT 
TO 
THE 
UNITED STATES 
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize one of our global partners, 
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who is 
in Washington, D.C. this week for the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the 
Quad Summit, a strategic conversation be-
tween the United States, India, Japan, and 
Australia. 
America and India have a strong and valu-
able partnership, which has allowed both na-
tions to flourish. Welcoming the wide range of 
collaborative activities undertaken to improve 
their citizens’ lives, we must work to revitalize 
our existing alliance and find new areas for 
collaboration and mutual benefit. 
I was grateful to meet with the Consulate 
General of India in Georgia Dr. Swati V. 
Kulkarni earlier this month, where I reaffirmed 
my commitment to deepening our ties and ad-
vancing practical cooperation between our two 
countries in combatting COVID–19, partnering 
on emerging technologies and cyberspace, 
and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THAJ 
KHU MOUA LIA 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 23, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Thaj Khu Moua Lia. Moua Lia 
passed away on August 14, 2021. Moua Lia 
was a husband, father, grandfather, and great- 
grandfather as well as an inspiration for the 
entire Hmong community. 
Moua Lia was born in Phac Lac (Nong Het), 
Xieng Khouang Province, Kingdom of Laos. 
Throughout his life, he fought to bring more 
education to the mountains of Laos, leading 
him to become the first Superintendent of 
Schools in Xieng Khouang Province. 
After studying pedagogy, student testing 
and placement, special education, and ethnic 
group school systems in France and Thailand, 
Moua Lia returned to Laos and began rehabili-
tating Xieng Khouang Province by reforming 
the school systems in remote areas that had 
been ravaged by war. During this time, he 
helped establish the first institution for Hmong 
teachers called Samthong College. 
His commitment to improving the education 
system for ethnic minorities in Laos took him 
all over the world, specifically to Singapore 
and the United States, where he collected 
ideas and strategies for how to better ap-
proach education in the regions he served. 
When Laos fell to communist army forces in 
1975, Moua Lia and his family received asy-
lum in France for 15 years. They later moved 
to Merced, California, where he worked as the 
Community Outreach Specialist in the local 
school district, and retired in 2005, still actively 
supporting the community through various 
projects. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Thaj Khu Moua Lia. 
His service and contributions to the Hmong 
community in the Central Valley and beyond 
will be missed. I join his friends, loved ones, 
and community in celebrating Moua Lia’s life.
