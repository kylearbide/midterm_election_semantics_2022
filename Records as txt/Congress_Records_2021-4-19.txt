Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2021 
No. 67 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mrs. DINGELL). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
April 19, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable DEBBIE 
DINGELL to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 
p.m. 
f 
VALUE OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as the son of a civil engineer, 
I was raised with an understanding of 
the value of infrastructure that serves 
people and benefits communities. My 
commitment 
to 
infrastructure 
has 
spanned decades. As a young man, I put 
shovel to the road for the construction 
of highways and bridges; and now, 
today, I advocate for infrastructure im-
provements in Congress. 
As we know all too well in rural 
Pennsylvania, infrastructure has real- 
life consequences for communities. At 
its core, improving roads, bridges, and 
other key infrastructure should be a 
commonsense, 
bipartisan 
priority. 
Failing infrastructure does not dis-
criminate. A broken bridge can harm 
Democrats just as it can harm Repub-
licans. 
Unfortunately, the so-called infra-
structure reform put forth by Presi-
dent Biden fails to take seriously the 
challenges that we are currently facing 
in Pennsylvania and around the entire 
country. In the rural district that I 
represent, we know the importance of 
true infrastructure. We need to make 
our roadways and bridges safer, we 
need to improve our transportation 
systems, and we desperately need to 
deploy reliable internet to those lack-
ing access to broadband. This is what 
true infrastructure is. But, unfortu-
nately, that is not the Biden plan. 
Let’s look at the facts. In President 
Biden’s infrastructure plan, less than 6 
percent would go to roads and bridges; 
less than 2 percent would go to water-
ways, locks, dams, ports, and airports; 
and less than 5 percent, unfortunately, 
would go to broadband. 
With $600 billion devoted to the 
Green New Deal, this has never been 
about infrastructure. In Pennsylvania, 
the extreme policies championed in the 
Biden plan will crush our vital manu-
facturing and energy industries. This 
plan prioritizes the progressive agenda 
over the needs of the American work-
ers and small businesses. 
In the name of infrastructure, Demo-
crats want to kill jobs, raise taxes, bur-
den families, and stunt our recovery 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Today, I ask a very simple question: 
Is it worth it? 
As we seek to define infrastructure 
and consider improvements to our Na-
tion’s 
fundamental 
infrastructure 
needs, I urge all of my colleagues to 
dispense with the political games. We 
need roads, bridges, and reliable inter-
net. We do not need the Green New 
Deal. Stop calling this infrastructure. 
Stop hiding progressive policies in tro-
jan horses. Stop trying to trick the 
American people. 
While I stand ready to work with the 
President and House Democrats on 
what is true infrastructure reform, this 
plan is further evidence that the Biden- 
Harris administration are more happy 
to push their radical agenda at the ex-
pense of hardworking Americans. 
Instead of propelling these radical 
policies, this could be a good-faith op-
portunity to deliver results for the 
American people. If we work together, 
we can get this job done. From deploy-
ing rural broadband to sustaining our 
basic roads, we must bridge this divide. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF STEVEN KOPPERUD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
one of the great voices for American 
agriculture here in our Nation’s Cap-
ital, Steven L. Kopperud. 
His death this past year was sudden 
and a shock to all of us who knew him. 
Steve was always the same, from the 
first day I met him almost 25 years ago 
until the last time we talked. He was a 
great friend, one whom you could trust 
to shoot you straight. As are so many 
in the agriculture arena, he was a 
down-to-earth, great guy; the type you 
could pick up a conversation with as 
though you had just talked yesterday 
when, in fact, it could have been a year 
or more; the type who would always be 
there for you. And if it was a policy 
question, he always, always, had the 
facts. He believed in his work, and he 
was passionate about it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1894 
April 19, 2021 
After growing up in Minneapolis and 
attending the University of Minnesota, 
Steve started his career in journalism, 
writing for the Minneapolis Star Trib-
une and the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
He eventually became the Washington 
bureau chief for Feedstuffs, which fur-
ther introduced him to the world of ag-
riculture. 
From there, he launched a long, dis-
tinguished career in advocacy, lob-
bying on all things animal, everything 
from food, livestock, poultry, trade, 
and animal welfare, to biotech, among 
countless other agricultural issues. He 
was a founder of the Animal Alliance 
Association, and eventually started his 
own firm to represent clients across 
the Nation’s agriculture sector. 
Steve played an instrumental role in 
the passage of every farm bill in the 
past 35 years, from his first in 1985 to 
his last in 2018. He could always be 
found in the Halls of Congress, the 
White House, or USDA, making the 
case for commonsense agriculture poli-
cies critical to our producers and 
American consumers. And by the fortu-
itous nature of events early on in his 
career, he became a key voice with 
great expertise in the animal welfare 
policy arena. 
Steve leaves behind his wife, Judith, 
of more than 45 years, and many, many 
friends. The contributions he made to 
agriculture were numerous, leaving a 
great legacy of advocacy that has bene-
fited 
American 
producers 
and 
has 
helped to feed the world. His was a life 
very well-lived, and American agri-
culture is that much better because of 
Steve Kopperud, and so is our country. 
TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN JUSTICE 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay particular tribute to an 
individual who has been an institution 
in the Cape Fear region for decades, my 
friend and former colleague in the 
State legislature, Carolyn Justice. 
Carolyn served five terms in the 
North Carolina House of Representa-
tives, representing New Hanover and 
Pender Counties. Before her service in 
the State legislature, she served on 
Pender County’s Board of Commis-
sioners. She has also served as a trust-
ee of New Hanover Regional Medical 
Center, Pender Memorial Hospital, and 
as chair of the Lower Cape Fear River 
Program. 
Now, I got to know Carolyn while 
serving in the State Senate. She was a 
co-chair of the State House Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Agriculture 
and Natural and Economic Resources, 
while I was co-chair of the Senate Ap-
propriations Subcommittee. So we got 
to know each other quite well as we 
went line by line of the State budget, 
making cuts to the programs under our 
purview. 
The economic collapse of 2008 and 
2009 had left the State budget in sham-
bles, and it was our job to help balance 
it. These were not easy decisions, but, 
with Carolyn as a key partner, we 
made the budget numbers work while 
doing our best to fund the programs of 
most value to the citizens of the State. 
Through her service and kindness to 
others, Carolyn Justice continues to 
leave an indelible mark on south-
eastern North Carolina. This is why it 
is so fitting that she was recently 
named by the Wilmington Star-News in 
March, which was Women’s History 
Month 2021, as one of 106 women who 
have made the Port City area a better 
place. 
I don’t know of anyone who stands 
stronger for the Cape Fear region and 
the causes in which she believes. This 
is a well-deserved honor for a very dis-
tinguished public servant and my great 
friend and colleague. 
f 
CELEBRATING 
THE 
NOMINATION 
OF 
REAR 
ADMIRAL 
MICHAEL 
BOYLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the service, sac-
rifice, and recent nomination of one of 
my constituents, Rear Admiral Mi-
chael E. Boyle. 
Admiral Boyle has served as director 
of Maritime Operations for the U.S. Pa-
cific Fleet since June of 2020. Admiral 
Boyle was designated a naval aviator 
in January of 1990. 
In his 30 years of dedicated service, 
he 
has 
held 
numerous 
positions 
throughout the United States Naval 
Command. Whether it was operational 
tours, like aboard the USS Forrestal in 
support of Operation Provide Comfort 
in Northern Iraq, or aboard the USS 
Saratoga in support of Operation Pro-
vide Promise in Bosnia, Admiral Boyle 
has shown what leadership, fortitude, 
and duty look like in the United States 
Navy. 
I commend the Secretary of Defense, 
General Lloyd Austin for his nomina-
tion of Rear Admiral Boyle to the rank 
of two-star flag officer, rear admiral, in 
the United States Navy. His work in 
keeping our Nation safe and securing 
American interests abroad have not 
gone unnoticed. 
I want to personally thank Rear Ad-
miral Michael Boyle for his service to 
this country and his steadfast duty in 
defense of our Constitution. 
Congratulations, 
Admiral. 
Semper 
Fortis. 
HONORING ASSISTANT CHIEF OF POLICE JOHN 
JOCK 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the distinguished 
service of Assistant Chief of Police 
John Jock of the Orange Park Police 
Department. 
Over the past 25 years, Assistant 
Chief Jock has worked under three po-
lice chiefs, four town managers, and 
has become a valued member of the 
force in our community. Starting as a 
patrol officer for the OPPD back in 
1996, he has earned promotions three 
times, achieving the rank of assistant 
police chief, and even receiving his 
master’s degree in the process. 
He graduated from the FDLE Florida 
Leadership Academy in 2011, and served 
on the Clay County SWAT team for 
over a decade. Mr. Jock has been on 
the front lines of law enforcement for a 
quarter century and, in that time, has 
investigated and solved criminal cases, 
provided disaster training and commu-
nication, and has been a valued com-
munity leader. 
As a citizen of Orange Park for the 
last 22 years, Assistant Chief Jock en-
tered retirement earlier this month 
after 25 years of service. As the wife of 
a fellow SWAT team member, I want to 
wish him and his family a happy, safe, 
and productive retirement. 
HONORING CAPTAIN MARK ELAM 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and celebrate the 
life and service of Captain Mark Elam 
of the Putnam County Department of 
Corrections. 
Captain Elam served in the Putman 
County Sheriff’s Office for nearly 20 
years and, in that time, proved himself 
to be a hardworking servant. 
Before joining the sheriff’s office, 
Mark served 4 years in the United 
States Marine Corps. But the role that 
he excelled at the most was as a family 
man. He was a devoted husband to his 
wife, Lachrisha, for 15 years and a fa-
ther to two children. Before Captain 
Elam’s death last week, Mark and his 
wife were in the process of adopting 
five siblings. 
He had a servant’s heart and so much 
compassion to give. His loss leaves a 
hole in the Putnam County law en-
forcement community, but his memory 
will live on in the work and good deeds 
he did in life. 
I want to extend my condolences to 
his wife, children, and the entire Put-
nam County Sheriff’s Office in their 
enormous loss. 
God bless Captain Elam and his fam-
ily. 
You’ve got the watch.

HONORING
GILCHRIST
COUNTY
SHERIFF’S
SER-
GEANT NOEL RAMIREZ AND DEPUTY TAYLOR 
LINDSEY 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and remember Gil-
christ County Sheriff’s Sergeant Noel 
Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey 
who were both gunned down in the line 
of duty 3 years ago today. 
On April 19, 2018, Sergeant Ramirez 
and Deputy Lindsey were eating lunch 
at a restaurant in Trenton, Florida, 
when a coward fired through a window 
and killed both officers in the line of 
duty. That man—whose name does not 
deserve to be mentioned—killed those 
two officers, consumed by a radical 
hate for law enforcement. That same 
hate for law enforcement that we saw 
then I continue to see today. 
Now more than ever we need to pub-
licly and boldly support our law en-
forcement officers. 
Noel and Taylor’s deaths remind us 
of the constant vigilance that an offi-
cer needs to have in order to return 
home safely to their families every 
night. Being an LEO is a difficult and 
often thankless job.

H1895 
April 19, 2021 
I want to take a moment to thank 
Sergeant Ramirez and Deputy Lindsey 
for their service and sacrifice to our

member their sacrifice and love for our 
hometown. 
I pledge to always have our brothers

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God our shepherd, You have en-
trusted us with the responsibility to 
tend Your sheep, to feed them and 
watch over them. May we be worthy of 
this mantle of awesome responsibility 
and live wholeheartedly into this task. 
May nothing we do be done simply out 
of obligation. But having received Your 
tender mercies in our own lives, may 
we be eager to serve You and those 
whom You have commended to our 
care. 
And if we lose sight of Your claim on 
our lives and waver in our duties, call 
us to examine the multitude of in-
stances where You have showered Your 
grace upon us. 
How then can we help but be so 
transformed that we would want noth-
ing else but to give of ourselves from 
the depths of our souls? 
May we then be examples of what it 
means to serve You. May we live lives 
of kindness and humility, not lifting 
ourselves up, but waiting with patience 
for the moment when, in the fullness of 
time, You reveal the purpose for all our 
efforts and energies, in Your gracious 
plan. 
In the meantime, we cast ourselves— 
our anxieties, our best intentions, and 
our most fervent hopes on You—in sure 
and certain hope of Your steadfast love 
for us. 
It is in the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. TITUS led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
DOUBLE STANDARDS 
(Mrs. MCCLAIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. 
MCCLAIN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I rise because of the double 
standards in this Chamber. Once again, 
this weekend we saw a Member of the 
majority openly call for more con-
frontation in a Minneapolis suburb. 
That very night there was a drive-by 
shooting in that community where po-
lice and National Guardsmen were tar-
geted. 
If this were reversed, if this were said 
by a Republican, you know, Madam 
Speaker, that the majority in this 
Chamber would move to strip that Rep-
resentative of their committees and 
possibly move to expel them from Con-
gress. 
We have actually seen this before. 
If what President Trump said on Jan-
uary 6 was inciting a riot, then what do 
the words ‘‘get more confrontational’’ 
mean? 
Are those not the words someone 
would use if they wanted to incite 
more violence or insurrection? 
If the majority cares about this insti-
tution, and if the majority cares about 
our Nation, then they need to get their 
own house in order and tamp down this 
vile rhetoric. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LORRIE FORD 
MERKER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Lorrie Ford Merker for all the work 
she has done to improve the lives of 
Georgia’s blueberry farmers. 
Lorrie has made outstanding con-
tributions to the blueberry industry for 
three decades. Born and raised in 
southeastern Michigan, Lorrie grad-
uated from Michigan State University 
and has spent her entire adult life im-
proving the agriculture sector. 
For the past 32 years Lorrie has 
worked with the Michigan Blueberry 
Growers Association which represents 
250 growers in eight States and British 
Columbia. She has also been involved 
in advocacy at the State and national 
levels to promote an understanding of 
the labor and environmental chal-
lenges facing farmers. 
Throughout her career she has accu-
mulated a long list of awards and ac-
complishments, including the North 
American Blueberry Council’s Alex 
Wetherbee Award, for her outstanding 
contributions to the promotion and 
marketing of blueberries. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Lorrie for all the work she has done for 
Georgia’s blueberry growers and for 
growers across the country. 
f 
HONORING BERNELL TRAMMELL 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in honor of the great Bernell 
Trammell of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
who owned eXpressions Journal Publi-
cations, which was located on 915 East 
Wright Street. 
Bernell Trammell was an avid reader 
and a very religious man who liked 
people. He graduated from Lincoln 
High School in Milwaukee. 
Last July 23, he was shot dead car-
rying a sign for Donald Trump. 
I would like to ask the city of Mil-
waukee to dial up the investigation for 
the murder of Bernell Trammell. I be-
lieve it is a shame in Milwaukee that 
when someone—one of few people— 
stands up and announces by a sign that 
he is voting for Donald Trump that he 
would be shot dead. 
He was an iconoclast, he was a very 
spiritual man delving in different reli-
gions, and he was all over the political 
spectrum as far as the people he en-
dorsed. But while he was carrying a 
Donald Trump sign, he was shot down 
last July 23. 
I beg the city of Milwaukee to do 
something about this horrible crime. 
f 
MARIJUANA BANKING BILL 
(Mr. GOOD of Virginia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1996, the 
marijuana banking bill. This legisla-
tion 
is 
about 
legitimizing 
and 
bankrolling the marijuana industry 
and making legalization inevitable. 
It is sad that the House is voting on 
this bill during a time when our coun-
try is seeing increases in addiction, de-
pression, and suicide. Rather than 
helping victims of despair, we are en-
hancing the financial benefits for those 
peddling and profiting off the sale of 
marijuana. 
We are not even directly debating our 
drug laws. No. We are cowardly debat-
ing if we should reward States for un-
dermining the rule of law. 
Despite what the swamp says, we 
don’t need recreational marijuana. As

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1896 
April 19, 2021 
recently as 2016, the DEA determined 
that marijuana should remain a sched-
ule I substance. 
I don’t care what the lobbyists or 
talking heads for the marijuana indus-
try like John Boehner say, I care about 
keeping dangerous substances away 
from our children and standing for the 
values I was elected to fight for. 
The last thing our country needs is 
our help facilitating the profitability 
of addictive, behavior-altering, rec-
reational drug use. 
I oppose the bill, and I urge every 
Member to do the same.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 490, the DHS MORALE Act. 
Every day, the Department of Home-
land Security workforce carries out an 
array of critical missions, from screen-
ing travelers to securing cyberspace, to 
responding to disasters. 
The 240,000 men and women who 
make up this workforce should feel ap-
preciated, not only by the American 
people, but also by DHS. Unfortu-
nately, that does not seem to be the 
case. 
The Office of Personnel Management 
has found that DHS employees are con-
sistently less satisfied with their jobs 
compared to the average Federal em-
ployee. Since 2005, DHS’ own employees 
ranked 
the 
Department 
dead 
last 
among large Federal departments in 
the annual Best Places to Work in the 
Federal Government survey. Scratch-
ing below the surface, the Best Places 
to Work in the Federal Government 
survey found that DHS’ workforce is 
the most dissatisfied when it comes to 
training, teamwork, work-life balance, 
and support for diversity. 
In response to the concerns expressed 
by the workforce, Chairman THOMPSON 
introduced the DHS MORALE Act to 
require DHS to create and implement 
policies related to leadership develop-
ment, employee engagement, career 
progression, and employee recognition. 
Specifically, H.R. 490 requires the De-
partment to prioritize career develop-
ment opportunities and leadership de-
velopment opportunities for DHS em-
ployees. 
Additionally, it would require DHS 
to establish an employee engagement 
steering committee comprised of em-
ployees across the Department to bet-
ter identify the causes of low morale

and what initiatives are working to im-
prove it, and to establish an annual 
employee award program to recognize 
those in the DHS workforce who go 
above and beyond in their work to pro-
tect the homeland. 
Identical versions of this measure 
have been approved by the House in 
prior Congresses. 
This Congress, a new provision was 
added to the bill to respond to rec-
ommendations issued last month by 
the Government Accountability Office 
regarding morale challenges at the De-
partment. 
The provision directs DHS’ chief 
human capital officer to review and ap-
prove DHS component agency plans to 
ensure they include initiatives to ad-
dress the root causes of low morale and 
performance metrics for measuring im-
plementation of those initiatives. 
Enactment of H.R. 490 will help put 
DHS on a path toward fixing the long-
standing morale problems at DHS. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of H.R. 490, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 490, the Department of 
Homeland Security MORALE Act of 
2021. 
This legislation, sponsored by Chair-
man THOMPSON, will empower the De-
partment’s chief human capital officer 
to improve leadership development, 
employee engagement, and morale at 
the Department, which consistently 
ranks near the bottom of all Federal 
departments. 
This bill will support the Depart-
ment’s most important asset, the many 
dedicated security professionals that 
work diligently to better protect our 
Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
490, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 490 will im-
prove morale among the Department’s 
240,000 employees. That is why it has 
the support of unions representing DHS 
employees: The National Border Patrol 
Council, the National Treasury Em-
ployees Union, and the American Fed-
eration of Government Employees. 
Enactment of H.R. 490 will also force 
DHS to examine the root causes of the 
longstanding morale problems and de-
velop responsive approaches to move 
the Department forward in a positive 
direction. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for my col-
leagues’ support, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 490, ‘‘DHS MORALE Act,’’ 
which expands the duties of the Chief Human 
Capital Officer to address morale throughout 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
The bill provides for: 
1. leader development and employee en-
gagement, 
2. maintaining a catalogue of available em-
ployee development opportunities, and 
3. issuing a DHS-wide employee engage-
ment action plan. 
The bill directs DHS to establish an em-
ployee engagement steering committee and 
authorizes it to establish an annual employee 
award program. 
DHS is also required to report to the con-
gressional homeland security committees the 
impacts of the lapse in appropriations between 
December 22, 2018 and January 25, 2019 on 
(1) DHS human resources operations; (2) 
DHS’s ability to meet hiring benchmarks; and 
(3) retention, attrition, and morale of DHS per-
sonnel. 
As a senior member of this committee I 
have long been troubled by the low morale, 
employee retention and job opportunities with-
in the entire agency and what impact these 
issues have had on homeland security. 
Over my service on this committee, from its 
inception, I have learned a great deal about 
the capacity and strength of the men and 
women who work at the Department of Home-
land Security. 
I hold them in the highest regard for their 
dedication and service to our country. 
This nation depends on the men and 
women of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity (DHS) to protect citizens from those who 
wish to do them harm. 
DHS is charged with protecting the nation 
from terrorism threats. 
The agency also assists local, state, and 
federal law enforcement to prepare to meet 
those threats which are significantly different 
than what was seen on September 11, 2001. 
Because of the dedication of DHS profes-
sionals, we are better prepared to face these 
challenges as one nation united against a 
common foe. 
The Department of Homeland Security was 
not created to protect the nation from des-
perate people escaping violence and poverty, 
seeking asylum in our country or the ravages 
of a virus attacking and killing over half a mil-
lion Americans. 
It was created to prevent attacks against our 
nation such as the one carried out by foreign 
terrorists who used commercial planes as mis-
siles to destroy the World Trade Center Tow-
ers, and a section of the west side of the Pen-
tagon, and would have killed more if not for 
the heroic acts of the passengers on Flight 93 
to stop the attackers from reaching their ulti-
mate destination right here at our nation’s 
Capitol. 
On January 6, 2021, our nation was once 
again threatened, but it was from an enemy 
found on our own shores led by the former 
President of the United States to attack the 
Capitol building during the constitutionally 
mandated Joint Meeting of Congress to count 
the ballots cast by presidential electors and 
announce the results and the winner to the 
nation and the world. 
Today, our nation faces multiple crisis at the 
same time that are challenging our way of life, 
values, and resolve; challenges the American 
people are, and will be, prepared to face and 
overcome. 
As Americans we are best when we are true 
to the values we hold dear, beginning with fi-
delity to the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States. 
The Department of Homeland Security has 
had low employee morale and low employee 
engagement since it began operations in 2003 
and this must change. 
In 2019, the Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) issued a report on DHS employee 
morale. 
This report addressed: 
1. drivers of employee engagement at DHS 
and 
2. the extent that DHS has initiatives to im-
prove employee engagement and ensures ef-
fective engagement action planning. 
GAO analyzed employee trends within DHS, 
reviewed component employee engagement 
action plans and met with officials from DHS 
and component human capital offices as well 
as unions and employee groups. 
I was at the Capitol on September 11, 2001, 
and I will never forget the Members who were 
there with me as we sang God Bless America 
on the steps of the Capitol. 
In the days and weeks following the attacks, 
we were uncertain what threat might come 
and how many lives might be lost as we 
worked to put resources in place to deal with 
an enemy that might be among us. 
Over the past nineteen years we have 
learned a great deal about homeland security, 
but we must learn more about making sure 
that agency professionals have what they 
need to excel. 
We will be better prepared to face these 
challenges as one nation, united against a 
common foe, when morale issues within DHS 
have been effectively addressed. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 490, DHS MORALE Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 490. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trusted 
Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW. 
Not later than one year after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall conduct a 
review of Department of Homeland Security 
trusted traveler programs. Such review shall 
examine the following: 
(1) The extent to which the Department of 
Homeland Security tracks data and monitors 
trends related to trusted traveler programs, 
including root causes for identity-matching 
errors resulting in an individual’s enroll-
ment in a trusted traveler program being re-
instated. 
(2) Whether the Department coordinates 
with the heads of other relevant Federal, 
State, local, Tribal, or territorial entities re-
garding redress procedures for disqualifying 
offenses not covered by the Department’s 
own redress processes but which offenses im-
pact an individual’s enrollment in a trusted 
traveler program. 
(3) How the Department may improve indi-
viduals’ access to reconsideration procedures 
regarding a disqualifying offense for enroll-
ment in a trusted traveler program that re-
quires the involvement of any other Federal, 
State, local, Tribal, or territorial entity. 
(4) The extent to which travelers are in-
formed about reconsideration procedures re-
garding enrollment in a trusted traveler pro-
gram. 
SEC. 3. ENROLLMENT REDRESS. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, the Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall, with respect to an individual whose en-
rollment in a trusted traveler program was 
revoked in error extend by an amount of 
time equal to the period of revocation the 
period of active enrollment in such a pro-
gram upon re-enrollment in such a program 
by such an individual. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port H.R. 473, the Trusted Traveler Re-
consideration and Restoration Act of 
2021. 
Before the pandemic, millions of 
travelers participated in DHS’ trusted 
traveler 
programs, 
like 
TSA’s 
PreCheck and CBP’s Global Entry, 
NEXUS, SENTRI, and FAST programs, 
to get them where they need to go a 
little faster. 
These are win-win programs where 
DHS moves vetted goods and people in 
an expeditious manner, thereby freeing 
up screening resources to focus on 
higher-risk travelers. 
Given the benefits of these programs, 
it is troubling to hear about people 
being unable to enroll in one of these 
programs, despite meeting all of the se-
curity requirements needed to partici-
pate. 
We all have an interest in ensuring 
that the vetting for these programs is 
thorough and, where there are identi-
fying matching errors or other issues 
that may result in a qualified applicant 
being wrongly rejected, the issues get 
addressed in a timely way. 
To ensure these programs are oper-
ating effectively and consistently, H.R. 
473 directs the Government Account-
ability Office to review DHS’ trusted 
traveler programs. The GAO’s study 
will provide important insight into the 
Department’s identity matching proc-
ess and the redress options available to 
those who are improperly rejected. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 473, the Trusted 
Traveler Reconsideration and Restora-
tion Act of 2021. 
This 
bill, sponsored by Ranking 
Member JOHN KATKO and cosponsored 
by Chairwomen WATSON COLEMAN and 
SLOTKIN, seeks to ensure the rights of 
travelers who have erroneously had 
their trusted traveler status revoked. 
From the CBP’s Global Entry and 
NEXUS to TSA’s PreCheck programs, 
the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s trusted traveler programs are 
critical to the safe and secure free 
movement of people. However, there 
are instances in which individuals are 
mistaken for people with the same or 
similar name or who otherwise find 
themselves in a position where they 
lose their trusted traveler status based 
on a database error. 
For those unfortunate persons, the 
process of getting their trusted trav-
eler status reinstated by DHS involves 
timely, cumbersome, and confusing bu-
reaucratic hurdles, often among sev-
eral Federal agencies. In these in-
stances, travelers lose valuable time 
off of their trusted traveler enrollment 
period, even though they spent hard- 
earned money to apply. 
H.R. 473 seeks to bring relief to the 
traveling public who are in need of hav-
ing their trusted traveler status rein-
stated. The bill requires a comprehen-
sive review by the Government Ac-
countability Office on the existing DHS 
processes related to trusted traveler 
programs and how the Department can 
improve individuals’ access to having 
their trusted traveler status reinstated 
when it has been revoked in error. 
Additionally, H.R. 473 directs the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to ex-
tend an individual’s enrollment in a 
trusted traveler program by a period 
commensurate with the amount of 
time they lost in their enrollment due 
to an error. 
I thank Ranking Member KATKO for 
his leadership on this bipartisan bill, 
and I thank Chairman THOMPSON for 
his commitment to bringing it to the 
floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security’s trusted traveler 
programs are important tools in the 
Department’s toolbox to screen people 
efficiently and concentrate its re-
sources on high-risk travelers. 
It is critical that the Department’s 
processes to vet enrollees be fair, con-
sistent, and based on accurate informa-
tion. The GAO assessment directed by 
this bill will help drive DHS to work 
towards those ends. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from New York (Mr. KATKO) for 
introducing this bill. I urge its passage, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 473, the ‘‘Trusted Traveler 
Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2021,’’ 
which directs the Government Accountability 
Office to review Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS) trusted traveler programs, and 
DHS to extend the enrollment period where an 
individual’s participation in a trusted traveler 
program was revoked in error. 
The Trusted Traveler consists of several 
programs that include: Global Entry, TSA 
Pre✔, SENTRI, NEXUS, and FAST. 
The Trusted Traveler Programs are risk- 
based programs to facilitate the entry of pre- 
approved travelers. 
All applicants are vetted to ensure that they 
meet the qualifications for the program to 
which they are applying. 
Receiving a ‘‘Best Match’’ or program rec-
ommendation based on eligibility or travel hab-
its does not guarantee acceptance into any 
Trusted Traveler program. 
We will be better prepared to face these 
challenges as one nation united against a 
common foe, when morale issues within DHS 
have been effectively addressed. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 473 the ‘‘Trusted Traveler Reconsider-
ation and Restoration Act of 2021.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 473. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 370, the Quadrennial Homeland 
Security Review Technical Corrections 
Act. 
Since 2007, the Department of Home-
land Security has been required to 
produce a quadrennial review of the 
sprawling Federal department to help 
chart its course for the future. To date, 
DHS has issued two Quadrennial Home-
land Security Reviews, or QHSRs. The 
third review, which was due by Decem-
ber 31, 2017, was never released by the 
Trump administration. 
Congress mandated that DHS, like 
the Defense Department, undertake a 
bottom-up review every 4 years in rec-
ognition of the fact that it has a vital, 
complex, and ever-expanding set of 
missions that need to be assessed in 
regular intervals to help DHS stay 
ahead 
of 
the 
constantly 
evolving 
threats facing our country. 
With the deadline for the fourth 
QHSR fast approaching, the gentle-
woman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson 
Coleman) reintroduced this bill to en-
sure that deficiencies that the Govern-
ment Accountability Office identified 
in prior reviews are fully addressed. 
In 2016, GAO issued a report that 
identified several weaknesses in how 
the Department developed the first two 
QHSRs. GAO, for example, expressed 
concerns about the degree to which the 
Department retained documentation to 
explain its findings and emphasized 
that documentation of the review proc-
ess is essential to ensuring the repeat-
ability of the review process. 
b 1445 
Importantly, H.R. 370 requires that 
DHS retain and, when requested, pro-
vide to Congress certain documenta-
tion related to each QHSR. 
It also addresses weaknesses that 
GAO identified with respect to con-
sultation 
with 
Homeland 
Security 
stakeholders and directs robust con-
sultation with State and local govern-
ments, 
academic 
institutions, 
and 
other stakeholders. 
Finally, H.R. 370 requires DHS to un-
dertake and document a risk analysis 
to inform its policy positions, a critical 
feature that was lacking in prior re-
views. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of H.R. 370, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 370, 
the Quadrennial Homeland Security 
Review 
Technical 
Corrections 
Act. 
This legislation makes important im-
provements to the Quadrennial Home-
land Security Review.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1901 
April 19, 2021 
This bill has strong bipartisan sup-
port from the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this bill. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, DHS is a sprawling $50 billion 
Federal agency with a diverse array of 
mission sets. As such, it is critical 
that, every 4 years, DHS carry out a 
rigorous bottom-up, risk-informed re-
view of the entire department that re-
flects robust engagement with Home-
land Security partners to produce a 
QHSR that can drive the department’s 
strategic vision for years to come. 
Enactment of H.R. 370 will help en-
sure that happens and that, in the 
years ahead, DHS better aligns its 
budgets and programs with its ever-ex-
panding missions. 
An identical version of this measure 
passed the House last Congress by a 
vote of 415–0. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of H.R. 370 and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 370. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

PROGRAM ACT 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 367) to amend 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to 
establish an acquisition professional 
career program, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 367 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homeland 
Security Acquisition Professional Career 
Program Act’’. 
SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF THE ACQUISITION 
PROFESSIONAL CAREER PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Title VII of the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new section:

‘‘Sec. 711. Acquisition 
professional 
career 
program.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 367, the 
Homeland Security Acquisition Profes-
sional Career Program Act. 
H.R. 367 authorizes the Department 
of Homeland Security’s Acquisition 
Professional Career Program which, 
since 2008, has been credited with help-
ing DHS onboard over 300 new hires 
into its acquisition workforce. 
At DHS, acquisition professionals, 
such as contract specialists, are re-
sponsible for spending billions of dol-
lars each year on the goods and serv-
ices needed for the department to carry 
out its missions. They acquire every-
thing from disaster relief supplies for 
FEMA to Coast Guard cutters and soft-
ware designed to protect Federal Gov-
ernment networks from cyber threats. 
Unfortunately, when it comes to hir-
ing and retaining acquisitions profes-
sionals, DHS has experienced chronic 
staffing shortages that, in the view of 
the Government Accountability Office, 
create a persistent challenge for DHS 
that can negatively affect the ability 
of DHS to acquire vital capabilities on 
time and on budget. 
H.R. 367 seeks to address this chal-
lenge by codifying DHS’ rigorous devel-
opment program in which participants 
are provided with acquisition training, 
mentorship, 
department-wide 
rota-
tions, and other career development 
opportunities. 
Enactment of this measure will help 
DHS maintain a pipeline for its acqui-
sition workforce to directly support 
the department’s frontline officers and 
provide them with the tools that they 
need. 
A prior version of this bill passed the 
House by a voice vote last September 
on a bipartisan basis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to once again support this leg-
islation. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1902 
April 19, 2021 
I rise today in support of H.R. 367, 
the Homeland Security Acquisition 
Professional Career Program Act. This 
legislation will help create a pipeline 
for the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to better recruit talented acquisi-
tion professionals. 
This critical program is an important 
step to making DHS more agile and ef-
ficient in its role of protecting our Na-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting H.R. 367. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
from Nevada for her leadership on this 
bill. 
Americans look to DHS to respond 
after a disaster, prevent terrorism, and 
protect cyberspace. Within DHS, its 
leaders at every level of the organiza-
tion look to the acquisition workforce 
to ensure that the department has the 
tools needed to get the job done. 
Since 2008, DHS’ Acquisition Profes-
sional Career Program has created a 
vital pipeline for the department to 
hire acquisitions professionals who de-
velop their knowledge and skills in 
house at DHS. 
Enactment of H.R. 367 would ensure 
that DHS is able to continue to run 
this successful program which the de-
partment has come to rely on to help 
address 
chronic 
staffing 
shortages 
within its acquisition workforce. 
Again, I want to thank and commend 
the 
gentlewoman, 
Congresswoman 
TITUS from Nevada, who is presently 
presiding over the House, for her lead-
ership on H.R. 367. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 367. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 367, the ‘‘Homeland Secu-
rity Acquisition Professional Career Program 
Act,’’ which establishes in the Department of 
Homeland Security an acquisition professional 
career program to develop a cadre of acquisi-
tion professionals. 
Acquisition professionals work in one of six 
career fields, each of which plays a vital role 
in Department Acquisition. 
The six Acquisition career fields include: 
1. Contract Specialist, 
2. Program Manager, 
3. Logistician,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
408, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity Mentor-Protege Program Act of 
2021. 
Since the earliest days of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, it has op-
erated a mentor-protege program to 
encourage large businesses to help 
small businesses build their capacity to 
compete for government contracts. 
However, this important program 
was never codified in law. H.R. 408 not 
only authorizes the existing program 
but improves it. 
Small businesses, including woman-, 
veteran-, and minority-owned firms, 
are the backbone of our economy, but 
far too often complex Federal con-
tracting requirements shut them out of 
the Federal marketplace. 
Building and sustaining a reliable 
pool of small business vendors is crit-
ical to ensuring that DHS’ ever-evolv-
ing contracting needs are met and 
America’s security is enhanced. 
H.R. 408 seeks to build and sustain 
this pool by incentivizing large busi-
nesses to provide technical, manage-
rial, and financial assistance and sub-
contracting 
opportunities 
to 
small 
businesses. 
The bill requires participating busi-
nesses to commit to a mentor-protege 
relationship for 3 years to help estab-
lish long-term relationships between 
large and small contractors. 
Additionally, to ensure that Congress 
can monitor the effectiveness of the 
program in an ongoing way, it requires 
DHS to annually report on program 
participation and the benefits con-
ferred upon small businesses. 
Enactment of H.R. 408 will ensure the 
continued and lasting success of the 
mentor-protege program, a vital small 
business development program. 
It should also be noted that this bill 
passed the House unanimously during 
the 116th Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to once again support this leg-
islation. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 408, 
the Department of Homeland Security 
Mentor-Protege Program Act of 2021. 
This legislation will help the depart-
ment better improve its contracting 
with small and disadvantaged firms. In 
doing so, the department will become 
stronger and more diverse. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
supporting H.R. 408. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, formally authorizing the De-
partment of Homeland Security’s men-
tor-protege program will ensure the 
continued success of this important 
small business program. 
John Crosby, the famous conductor, 
once said, ‘‘A mentor is a brain to pick, 
an ear to listen, and a push in the right 
direction.’’ 
DHS is to be commended for recog-
nizing that there are small businesses 
with novel technologies that want to 
help keep America secure, but may 
lack experience in the Federal market-
place and need a mentor to give them 
a push in the right direction. 
I thank the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. MCEACHIN) for introducing this 
bill to help grow partnerships between 
small businesses and DHS. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 408. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 408, the ‘‘Department of 
Homeland Security Mentor-Prote´ge´ Program 
Act of 2021,’’ which provides statutory author-
ity for the mentor-prote´ge´ program of the De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) under 
which a mentor firm enters into an agreement 
with a prote´ge´ firm to assist the latter to com-
pete for prime contracts and subcontracts of 
DHS. 
The Mentor-Prote´ge´ program is designed to 
motivate and encourage large business prime 
contractor firms to provide mutually beneficial 
developmental assistance to small business, 
veteran-owned small business, service-dis-
abled 
veteran-owned 
small 
business, 
HUBZone small business, small disadvan-
taged business, and women-owned small 
business concerns. 
The participating Mentor-Prote´ge´
Compa-
nies, program is also designed to: 
1. Improve the performance of contracts and 
subcontracts. 
2. Foster the establishment of long-term 
business relationships between large prime 
contractors and small business subcontrac-
tors. 
3. Strengthen subcontracting opportunities 
and accomplishments through three incen-
tives. 
ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION 
All firms must be in good standing in the 
federal marketplace. 
The program excludes firms that are on the 
Federal List of Debarred or Suspended Con-
tractors. 
A Mentor Firm is open to any large business 
firm that demonstrates the commitment and 
capability to assist in the development of small 
business prote´ge´s.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1904 
April 19, 2021 
A Prote´ge´ Firm can partner with all small 
businesses that meet the definition of small 
business concern at FAR 19.001, based on 
their primary NAICS code, are eligible to be 
prote´ge´ firms. 
This includes small business, veteran- 
owned small business, service-disabled vet-
eran-owned small business, HUBZone small 
business, small disadvantaged business, and 
women-owned small business concerns. 
Benefits for Mentors to participate in this 
program include for acquisitions that require 
for a subcontracting plan, mentors are eligible 
to receive credit in the source selection/eval-
uation criteria process for mentor-prote´ge´ par-
ticipation. 
Additionally, a post-award incentive for sub-
contracting plan credit is available by recog-
nizing costs incurred by a mentor firm in pro-
viding assistance to a prote´ge´ firm and using 
this credit for purposes of determining whether 
the mentor firm attains a subcontracting plan 
participation goal applicable to the mentor firm 
under a Homeland Security contract. 
The program benefits the Prote´ge´ by allow-
ing them to receive technical, managerial, fi-
nancial, or any other mutually agreed upon 
benefit from mentors including work that flows 
from a government or commercial contract 
through subcontracting or teaming arrange-
ments. The assistance could result in signifi-
cant small business development. 
The benefits to the Department of Home-
land Security is the opportunity to move from 
the traditional large business prime contractor/ 
small business subcontractor model to a men-
tor-prote´ge´ relationship model based on mu-
tual agreement, trust, and meaningful busi-
ness development. 
Additionally, mentor-prote´ge´
arrangements 
may provide the Department of Homeland Se-
curity with greater assurance that a prote´ge´ 
subcontractor will be able to perform under a 
contract than a similarly situated non-prote´ge´ 
subcontractor. 
Further, prote´ge´ firms gain opportunities to 
seek and perform government and commercial 
contracts through the guidance and support of 
mentor firms that may not have been available 
to them without the mentor-prote´ge´ program. 
This type of program is working in the De-
partment of Defense with great success. It is 
time to formalize the work of the mentor- 
prote´ge´ program with DHS. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in voting 
for H.R. 408. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES)? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 397, the 
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and 
Nuclear Intelligence and Information 
Sharing Act of 2021. 
This past year, we have witnessed a 
global pandemic dominate nearly every 
aspect of American life and claim the 
lives of over half a million people. As it 
tore through our communities, it also 
brought into stark focus hard truths 
about inequities in our healthcare sys-
tem, the reliability of our PPE pipe-
line, the need for better information 
sharing between the Federal Govern-
ment and State, local, and private-sec-
tor partners. 
The legislation before us seeks to 
promote timely sharing of intelligence 
about 
chemical, 
biological, 
radio-
logical, and nuclear threats, or CBRN 
threats. It does so by specifically di-
recting the Department of Homeland 
Security to analyze CBRN-related ter-
rorist threats and share threat infor-
mation with Federal, State, and local 
partners. 
In the event of an attack of this na-
ture, situational awareness at all levels 
of government is key. Better situa-
tional awareness is also important to 
help New York City and other DHS 
grant recipients more efficiently target 
their grant dollars to address threats. 
Earlier versions of this bill over-
whelmingly passed in the House in the 
last three Congresses, and I urge my 
colleagues to support the measure once 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 397, 
the CBRN Intelligence and Information 
Sharing Act of 2021. 
We all know that terrorist groups 
have long sought to develop the capa-
bility to attack our Nation with chem-
ical, biological, radiological, and nu-
clear materials. H.R. 397 would address 
this threat by requiring the Office of 
Intelligence and Analysis, within the 
Department of Homeland Security, to 
support the homeland security-focused 
analysis of terrorist capabilities re-
lated to chemical, biological, radio-
logical, and nuclear materials, as well 
as threats to the homeland from global 
infectious diseases. 
To improve coordination with local 
law enforcement, H.R. 397 requires the 
Office of Intelligence and Analysis to 
share threat information not only with 
Federal entities but also State, local, 
Tribal, and territorial agencies. 
I commend my colleague, the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ), for 
introducing this important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, effective prevention and re-
sponse to terrorism and naturally oc-
curring threats start with information- 
sharing. 
At a time when threats are changing 
at such a rapid pace, H.R. 397 will help 
to facilitate information-sharing to 
better safeguard the homeland from 
bad actors. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 397, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 397, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 396, the Transit 
Security Grant Program Flexibility 
Act. 
This legislation, as introduced by my 
colleague 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO), seeks to make common-
sense adjustments to a DHS grant pro-
gram that helps keep my constituents 
safe. 
H.R. 396 requires technical changes 
to the Transit Security Grant Program 
to allow grant funding to be used for 
backfill staffing when associated with 
security training and give transit au-
thorities more time to expend grant 
funds on security improvements for 
public transportation systems or infra-
structure. 
Our transit systems are absolutely 
vital to daily travel and commerce. Ac-
cording to U.S. Census figures, 56 per-
cent of all New Yorkers rely on public 
transportation. In New York City, over 
5 million people depend on our trains 
and subways on a normal workday. 
Under the TSGP, New York City’s 
Metropolitan Transit Authority re-
ceived about $20 million in fiscal year 
2020 to protect riders from acts of ter-
rorism and other targeted violence. 
H.R. 396 is informed by feedback from 
grantees about challenges with the pro-
gram over the years, and it is intended 
to ensure that the Transit Security 
Grant Program remains current, and 
that funding reaches maximum impact. 
Enactment of this bill will help im-
prove a key DHS grant program and 
better secure our Nation’s transpor-
tation infrastructure. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in strong support of my 
bill, H.R. 396, the Transit Security 
Grant Program Flexibility Act. 
Whether it is bus systems, ferries, or 
passenger rail, the Transit Security 
Grant Program provides needed funds 
to transit agencies to protect critical 
surface transportation infrastructure 
and the traveling public from acts of 
terrorism. 
Unfortunately, we have already wit-
nessed multiple attacks across the 
globe: the 2005 bombing of the Tube in 
London, the 2016 metro station bomb-
ing in Brussels, and the 2017 New York 
Port Authority bombing. 
With billions of riders using surface 
transportation annually, and limited 
security screening, it should come as 
no surprise that surface transportation 
has been and continues to be a terror 
target. As such, we must ensure that 
first responders and transit agencies 
have the tools needed to secure our 
transit system. 
The Transit Security Grant Program 
Flexibility Act seeks to address chal-
lenges associated with fluctuating peri-
ods of performance by codifying the pe-
riod of performance at 36 months for 
the majority of eligible projects and 
extending it to 55 months for vital 
large-scale capital security projects. 
This ensures that these major projects 
can be successfully completed in the 
allotted time. 
Additionally, while Transit Security 
Grant Program awards can be used to 
provide personnel with essential secu-
rity training, recipients of awards are 
not currently permitted to use the 
grant program funds to pay for back-
filling personnel attending such train-
ing. This may, in turn, inhibit some 
transit agencies from sending their 
staff to vital security training. 
H.R. 396 will permit Transit Security 
Grant Program funds to be used for 
this purpose, consistent with other 
Homeland Security grant programs. 
Given the evolving threat landscape, 
and the continued calls from extremist 
groups for lone-wolf attacks to target 
crowded areas, it is imperative that the 
Transit Security Grant Program pro-
vide flexible solutions for grant recipi-
ents in order to protect these soft tar-
gets and keep everyday commuters 
safe. 
I am proud to continue the great 
work of former New York Members 
Dan Donovan and Peter King in intro-
ducing this important piece of legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 396, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, New York City has the larg-
est public transit system in the coun-
try, and New York City has the great-
est vulnerability to terrorism. 
I thank my colleague, Congressman 
GARBARINO, for his leadership in advo-
cating 
for 
transportation 
systems 
across the country. 
H.R. 396 is a measure that this coun-
try needs. I believe all of us in this 
body can agree that securing America’s 
transit systems is critical to homeland 
security, and so too must we invest to 
make and keep it safe. 
Enactment of H.R. 396 would bolster 
the security of what, in the view of my 
constituents, is about as critical as 
critical infrastructure gets and protect 
these systems and their riders against 
terrorist attacks and targeted violence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 396, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by

IMPROVING 
FHA 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
SMALL-DOLLAR 
MORTGAGES 
ACT OF 2021 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1532) to require a review of 
the effects of FHA mortgage insurance 
policies, practices, and products on 
small-dollar mortgage lending, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1532 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving 
FHA Support for Small-Dollar Mortgages 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. REVIEW OF FHA SMALL-DOLLAR MORT-
GAGE PRACTICES. 
(a) CONGRESSIONAL
FINDINGS.—The Con-
gress finds that— 
(1) affordable homeownership opportunities 
are being hindered due to the lack of financ-
ing available for home purchases under 
$70,000; 
(2) according to the Urban Institute, small- 
dollar mortgage loan applications in 2017 
were denied by lenders at double the rate of 
denial for large mortgage loans, and this dif-
ference in denial rates cannot be fully ex-
plained by differences in the applicants’ 
credit profiles; 
(3) according to data compiled by Attom 
Data solutions, small-dollar mortgage origi-
nations have decreased 38 percent since 2009, 
while there has been a 65-percent increase in 
origination of mortgages for more than 
$150,000; 
(4) the FHA’s mission is to serve credit-
worthy borrowers who are underserved and, 
according to the Urban Institute, the FHA 
serves 24 percent of the overall market, but 
only 19 percent of the small-dollar mortgage 
market; and 
(5) the causes behind these variations are 
not fully understood, but merit study that 
could assist in furthering the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s mission, 
including meeting the housing needs of bor-
rowers the program is designed to serve and 
reducing barriers to homeownership, while

protecting the solvency of the Mutual Mort-
gage Insurance Fund. 
(b) REVIEW.—The Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development shall conduct a review of 
its FHA single-family mortgage insurance 
policies, practices, and products to identify 
any barriers or impediments to supporting, 
facilitating, and making available mortgage 
insurance for mortgages having an original 
principal obligation of $70,000 or less. Not 
later than the expiration of the 12-month pe-
riod beginning on the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a re-
port to the Congress describing the findings 
of such review and the actions that the Sec-
retary will take, without adversely affecting 
the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insur-
ance Fund, to remove such barriers and im-
pediments to providing mortgage insurance 
for such mortgages. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have five legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, when it comes to 
promoting access to homeownership, 
much of the focus tends to be on how 
high housing prices are pricing many 
borrowers out of homeownership. But 
the landscape of homeownership oppor-
tunities is varied, and for many com-
munities, the lack of access to tradi-
tional mortgage financing for small- 
dollar mortgages continues to be a 
major barrier. 
Specifically, I am talking about 
mortgage financing for homes that are 
priced at $70,000 or less. For many rural 
communities, and predominantly com-
munities of color that are struggling to 
overcome the impacts of the fore-
closure crisis, there are lower-value 
homes that would otherwise be ideal 
homeownership opportunities for first- 
time home buyers and working class 
families, but the lack of traditional 
mortgage financing options acts as a 
barrier to those opportunities. 
b 1530 
Data from the Urban Institute shows 
that these small-dollar mortgages are 
denied by lenders at double the rate 
compared to larger loans, and this 
trend cannot be explained away by dif-
ferences in the creditworthiness of ap-
plicants. 
The bottom line is that lenders don’t 
make as much money originating these 
smaller loans, so they are less likely to 
make loans on collateral that don’t 
maximize their profit. 
The Federal Housing Administration 
was designed to serve underserved mar-
kets and could be instrumental in pro-
moting more small-dollar mortgage 
lending, but the data shows that the 
FHA is actually disproportionately 
failing to serve this market. So this 
bill would require the FHA to identify 
barriers to better serving the small- 
dollar mortgage market and to come 
up with an actionable plan to reduce 
those barriers. 
This bill is desperately needed at a 
time when mortgage rates are at his-
toric lows and home prices continue to 
rise. We must support affordable hous-
ing options for individual borrowers 
and their pursuit of the American 
Dream of homeownership. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1532. 
Some studies suggest that small-dol-
lar mortgages, which are amounts less 
than $70,000, may be disproportionately 
denied compared to loans of higher 
amounts, even when credit profiles are 
similar. 
If true, this could be an issue for fam-
ilies in my district and across the 
country who are trying to buy their 
first home, particularly in rural Amer-
ica. 
H.R. 1532 is a bipartisan bill reported 
last Congress by the House Financial 
Services Committee that seeks to un-
derstand 
the 
challenges 
associated 
with small-dollar lending and why. 
This bill asks the fundamental ques-
tions: Why not have the FHA review its 
own policies? Why shouldn’t the FHA 
look to determine whether there are 
borrowers who would otherwise qualify 
for a mortgage and who are being left 
out of the market as an unintended 
consequence of the FHA’s own regula-
tions? 
After all, the FHA’s mission is to 
serve creditworthy borrowers who are 
underserved by the private market. 
This includes serving without bias as 
to how small a loan seeking insurance 
should be or might be. 
Moreover, the FHA should under-
stand whether its own regulations are 
hurting borrowers’ access to credit and 
remedy the problem without affecting 
the health of the Mutual Mortgage In-
surance Fund, which is at issue. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank my colleagues on the sub-
committee, in particular Mr. CLEAVER 
and Ranking Member STIVERS, for 
bringing this issue to our attention and 
for their work on this important bill. 
H.R. 1532 is a positive example of 
Congress identifying a problem and 
working together in a bipartisan way 
to understand the causes and to iden-
tify a reasonable solution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
would inquire through the Chair if my 
colleague has any remaining speakers. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I do 
not. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my bill, the Improving FHA 
Support for Small-Dollar Mortgages 
Act. 
Housing is one of the most vital ways 
families have a shot at financial sta-
bility and freedom. However, affordable 
homeownership opportunities are being 
denied to my residents because of the 
lack of financing available for home 
purchases under $70,000. 
In fact, small-dollar mortgage loan 
applications in 2017 were denied by 
lenders at double the rate of denial for 
large mortgage loans. This is largely 
because the banks have decided that 
small-dollar mortgages are riskier be-
cause they rely on bogus credit score 
thresholds and the loans don’t give 
them enough profit. 
This impacts majority Black and 
Brown communities, as well as low-in-
come communities that are unbanked 
and underbanked. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
in 
my 
district 
alone, 68,000—or nearly 50 percent—of 
our owner-occupied homes are valued 
under $70,000. Think about that for a 
second. Almost half of the homes in my 
district stand little chance of getting 
financing from a bank. 
My bill directs the Department of 
Housing to report on barriers to mak-
ing small-dollar mortgage insurance 
available for mortgages under $70,000. 
It also requires HUD to report on poli-
cies, practices, and actions that will be 
taken to remove such barriers, to mak-
ing available mortgage insurance for 
mortgages of $70,000 or less. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to please vote in support of my 
bill to ensure that every family has ac-
cess to homeownership. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive TLAIB for her work on this impor-
tant bill, as we work to improve access 
to affordable homeownership. This bill 
is an important step that will help us 
better understand and break down the 
barriers to obtaining traditional mort-
gage financing for small-dollar mort-
gages. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1532. 
The question was taken.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

bill (H.R. 1491) to amend the Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act to provide en-
hanced protection against debt col-
lector harassment of members of the 
Armed Forces, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1491 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fair Debt

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this leg-
islation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive DEAN for her leadership on this im-
portant bill, which will provide much- 
needed relief and protection for our 
servicemembers. 
Two out of every five servicemem-
bers’ complaints submitted to the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau are 
about predatory debt collection prac-
tices. Some examples of what service-
members reported experiencing include 
inappropriate threats of punishment 
under the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice, threats to the rank and secu-
rity clearance of the servicemember, 
and even reports of debt collectors in-
appropriately 
contacting 
the 
com-
manding officer of the debt holder. 
It is a disgrace that people serving in 
the military are being threatened and 
intimidated. The impact of these abu-
sive collection practices is severe. 
Servicemembers 
have 
reported 
in-
creased stress and hardship because of 
predatory debt collectors. 
These unfair and unnecessary prac-
tices against people who are putting 
their lives on the line for this country 
must end, which is why the National 
Military Family Association; the Na-
tional Consumer Law Center; and the 
former CFPB Assistant Director for 
Servicemember Affairs, retired Army 
Colonel Paul Kantwill, all support this 
bill. 
I am happy to say that Democrats 
and Republicans agree that Congress 
should put a halt to these abusive prac-
tices, and this bill does just that. Con-
gresswoman DEAN’s work across the 
aisle and with the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee last Congress resulted 
in a House floor vote of 355–0. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to unanimously support this 
bill again so we can better protect our 
servicemembers, who do so much to 
protect us. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1491, the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices for Servicemembers Act. 
I thank Representative DEAN for of-
fering this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, our servicemembers 
put their lives on the line for us every 
day. To that end, we must ensure they 
are adequately protected from abuse or 
harassment 
related 
to 
outstanding 
debt. I am pleased that we were able to 
work in a bipartisan fashion to meet 
this goal. 
H.R. 1491 prohibits debt collectors 
from using threats against a service-
member’s rank or security clearance, 
or threats of prosecution under the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice. Not 
only are such practices unfair, they 
also create the risk of harm to military 
readiness. 
Last Congress, during the committee 
markup of H.R. 1491, Republicans ex-
pressed concerns that there were too 
many unanswered questions about how 
this bill could impact military readi-
ness. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
STIVERS), who has had a distinguished 
career in our military, offered an 
amendment, which directs the Comp-
troller General of the United States to 
conduct a study on the impact this bill 
has on readiness with servicemembers 
regarding debts in collection, as well as 
military readiness and national secu-
rity. This commonsense approach en-
sures that Congress understands and is 
able to account for the connection be-
tween national security and the protec-
tion of servicemembers from unfair 
practices. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Demo-
crat 
majority 
for 
accepting 
this 
amendment, and I am glad that it con-
tinues to be included in this bill we are 
considering today. This makes this a 
far more lasting bill, I believe, and 
more impactful on the people that the 
author and this Congress want to en-
sure are taken care of, and those are 
the folks who serve and protect us each 
and every day. 
As a reminder, this bill passed the 
House unanimously in March of last 
year. 
All Americans deserve to be treated 
with dignity and respect when faced 
with repaying a debt. This is especially 
true for our servicemembers, who fight 
for our freedoms every day. 
Madam Speaker, this bill contains 
important safeguards. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman

April 19, 2021 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN), who is 
also the sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding to me. I 
also thank the ranking member and 
the committee in its entirety for work-
ing on this bill together. It is a sign of 
bipartisanship, one that I can be proud 
of and we can all be proud of. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1491, the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices for Servicemembers Act. 
Every day, we are reminded of the 
significant sacrifices our troops make 
to protect us. As Members of Congress, 
I believe we have a responsibility to 
protect those who protect us. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices 
for Servicemembers Act works to live 
up to this responsibility by addressing 
abusive debt collection practices spe-
cifically targeting servicemembers. 
According to the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, approximately 40 
percent of complaints filed by service-
members concern debt collection, as 
compared 
to 
only 
26 
percent 
by 
nonservicemembers. These debt collec-
tion practices are manipulative and 
have negative career implications for 
soldiers, like contacting their superior 
officers or threatening them with rank 
reductions. 
Unfortunately, these practices do not 
stop with the servicemembers. Debt 
collectors also target military spouses, 
unfairly burdening our military fami-
lies who have sacrificed so much. 
These tactics are egregious and must 
stop. Our servicemen and -women make 
extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf. 
The last thing they need is harassment 
from debt collectors who take advan-
tage of their service, which is why I am 
pleased to rise in support of the bill 
today. 
b 1545 
Specifically, my bill amends the Fair 
Debt Collection Practices Act and pro-
hibits a debt collector from commu-
nicating with a servicemember’s chain 
of command or a dependent for the pur-
pose of threatening to have their rank 
reduced or threatening to revoke their 
security clearance. 
This legislation will help ensure that 
our military families are not unneces-
sarily targeted and shield them from 
bad practices from debt collectors. We 
recognize our servicemembers’ spirit of 
service, and we must do our part to be 
of service to them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members, 
as they did last Congress, to support 
the Fair Debt Collection Practices for 
Servicemembers Act. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Con-
gresswoman DEAN
for her excellent 
work on H.R. 1491 to help ensure our 
servicemembers are not threatened or 
harassed by unscrupulous debt collec-
tors. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support our servicemembers by vot-
ing ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1491, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R 1491, the ‘‘Fair Debt 
Collection for Servicemembers Act,’’ which ad-
dresses abusive debt collection practices af-
fecting members of the military by amending 
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCP 
A) by adding servicemember-specific provi-
sions to Section 805 (covering prohibited com-
munications in connection with debt collection) 
and 808 (defining unfair practices that con-
stitute a violation of the Act). 
H.R. 1491 specifically prohibits debt collec-
tors from making threats of rank reduction, 
revocation of security clearance or prosecution 
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
Further, the bill requires the Government 
Accountability Office to report the impact of 
this act on military readiness and national se-
curity, including the extent covered members 
with security clearances would be impacted by 
uncollected debt. 
While all Americans are covered by laws 
barring debt collectors from overly aggressive 
or deceptive tactics, military members and 
their families face particular financial chal-
lenges requiring extra protections: in service to 
their country, they relocate frequently, deploy 
overseas 
and 
are 
a 
prime 
target 
for 
scammers. 
Military members are also more vulnerable 
to debt collectors in some instances, and debt 
collectors have taken advantage of this vulner-
ability by targeting members of the Armed 
Services through calling their superior officers, 
threatening reduction in rank and even courts- 
martial. 
This past year has seen a rise in aggressive 
debt collections due to the impact of COVID– 
19, according to the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau (‘‘CFPB’’). 
According to the CFPB, in the past year 
credit and consumer reporting complaints ac-
counted for more than 58 percent of com-
plaints received by the CFPB, followed by 
debt collection (15 percent), credit card (7 per-
cent), checking or savings (6 percent), and 
mortgage complaints (5 percent). 
Nearly 40 percent of complaints filed by 
servicemembers with the CFPB concern debt 
collection—as compared to only 26 percent by 
non-servicemembers. 
This pandemic has been among the most 
disruptive long-term events we will see in our 
lifetimes, and it is not surprising that the 
shockwaves it sent across the planet were felt 
deeply in the consumer financial marketplace. 
Our servicemen and servicewomen make 
extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf, and 
they should not be forced to confront aggres-
sive and manipulative debt collectors who cap-
italize on the strains required of them in the 
course of their duties. 
It is critical for the United States Congress 
to stand with the women and men who have 
served our country and remove the unethical 
methods debt collectors use to prey upon our 
servicemembers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 1491, and address 
these abusive debt collection practices; the 
patriots serving our country deserve no less. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1491. 
The question was taken.

Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that

HOUSING FINANCIAL LITERACY 
ACT OF 2021 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I

bill (H.R. 1395) to require the Secretary 
of Housing and Urban Development to 
discount FHA single-family mortgage 
insurance premium payments for first- 
time homebuyers who complete a fi-
nancial literacy housing counseling 
program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1910 
April 19, 2021 
Representative BEATTY
who is the 
chairwoman of the Subcommittee on 
Diversity and Inclusion. The bill is also 
cosponsored by Representative STIV-
ERS. 
This bill would incentivize prospec-
tive home buyers to undergo housing 
counseling by offering a discount on 
FHA-backed mortgages for doing so. 
Research 
has 
consistently 
dem-
onstrated that loans made to borrowers 
who have received pre-purchase coun-
seling perform better than loans made 
to comparable borrowers who did not 
receive 
pre-purchase 
counseling 
on 
their mortgage. 
When borrowers are able to stay cur-
rent on their mortgage payments, lend-
ers save money too. A 2013 study by 
Freddie Mac found that when 90-day 
delinquencies were lowered by 29 per-
cent, lenders saved an average of $1,000 
per loan. So this bill would not only 
benefit consumers during an environ-
ment of historically low mortgage 
rates, it would also help further im-
prove the financial health of the FHA. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive BEATTY for her leadership on this 
commonsense, data-driven bill. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 
1395, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) 
for all of her hard work on H.R. 1395, 
the Housing Financial Literacy Act of 
2021. 
The Federal Housing Administration, 
FHA, currently provides government- 
backed mortgage insurance to more 
than $1.3 trillion in loans. FHA insur-
ance allows a wide array of borrowers 
to qualify for mortgages. This includes 
many low- and moderate-income fami-
lies who might not otherwise have ac-
cess to credit through traditional un-
derwriting. 
In fiscal year 2020, the FHA insured 
over 800,000 forward mortgage purchase 
loans, with more than 83 percent going 
to first-time home buyers. Given the 
large population of first-time home 
buyers using FHA, it makes sense to 
encourage those individuals to seek out 
ways to strengthen their financial 
knowledge and better prepare them for 
the challenges of homeownership. 
Right now, current law states that 
FHA has the ability to provide first- 
time homeowners with a discount on 
their FHA upfront premiums. However, 
the homeowner must complete an ap-
proved homeownership financial coun-
seling course. 
Yet, the statute is drafted in such a 
way that the provision only applies in 
particular 
circumstances. 
This 
in-
cludes when FHA upfront premiums ex-
ceed 2.75 percent. Since FHA upfront 
premiums are currently set at 1.75 per-
cent, the rate has not been exceeded in 
a decade. Thus, FHA does not currently 
provide an upfront premium discount 
to first-time home buyers who com-
plete a financial counseling course. 
H.R. 1395 would amend current law to 
require FHA to provide a one-quarter 
percent 
upfront 
premium 
discount, 
from the prevailing rate, in order to 
help those first-time home buyers get 
financial literacy and then get the dis-
count. This equates to about $625 of 
savings off the current premium struc-
ture on a $250,000 mortgage. This is not 
an insignificant amount. 
Given the nature of this, I think it is 
great to have a financial benefit for 
people understanding financial con-
sequences. I think there are many 
other areas in our government that 
would benefit from this type of think-
ing. 
The hope is that by making such a 
discount mandatory, more first-time 
home buyers will seek out financial lit-
eracy counseling which, in turn, will 
produce better outcomes for a tradi-
tionally at-risk group of home buyers. 
The bottom line is that FHA is a val-
uable tool to help expand the universe 
of mortgage credit in our housing sys-
tem. We ought to be doing all that we 
can to ensure that we are using our 
limited public resources to encourage 
all borrowers to be well-prepared for 
the commitments of homeownership 
through 
financial 
counseling 
or 
through other effective means of cre-
ating more stable and reliable bor-
rowers. 
So I think this is a very good bill 
thoughtfully done by Mrs. BEATTY, and 
it is bipartisan, coming out of com-
mittee last Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I have no more 
speakers. I urge its adoption, I ask my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the remainder of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Ohio for pushing this bill 
forward. 
This bill incentivizes financial lit-
eracy that will help avoid delin-
quencies and lower the upfront cost of 
homeownership for so many. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
important piece of legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
for many generations, the idea of the Amer-
ican Dream has been homeownership. Yet the 
goal for many Americans of owning the place 
they call home is more distant than ever be-
fore. It doesn’t just require savings and a good 
credit score anymore—but also a strong finan-
cial plan to ensure that you can hold on to it 
for the years to follow. 
That is why I am proud today to support 
H.R. 1395, the Housing Financial Literacy Act 
of 2021. This bill, introduced by my good 
friend and chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty of 
Ohio, provides a financial incentive for first- 
time homebuyers who choose to take a finan-
cial literacy course by providing a discount on 
mortgage insurance through the Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA). 
This bill would greatly benefit first-time 
homebuyers by not just saving them money 
during the homebuying process, but also pro-
viding them the tools needed to build a strong 
financial plan. I urge all my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation and hope the Senate will 
swiftly pass this bill so that first-time home-
buyers are able to benefit from this opportunity 
as soon as possible. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1395. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays.

NATIONAL SENIOR INVESTOR 
INITIATIVE ACT OF 2021 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1565) to create an interdivi-
sional taskforce at the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for senior inves-
tors. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1565 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1565, the Senior Security Act of 
2021, which would help protect Amer-
ica’s senior investors who can be dis-
proportionately vulnerable to invest-
ment-related frauds. 
In 2017 alone, State securities regu-
lators conducted nearly 4,709 investiga-
tions, leading to more than 2,100 en-
forcement actions, including 255 crimi-
nal prosecutions. These actions have 
resulted in approximately $486 million 
in restitution for harmed investors, 
nearly $79 million in fines and/or pen-
alties, and 1,985 years in incarceration 
or probation being ordered. 
The National Council on Aging esti-
mated that elder financial abuse and 
fraud costs older Americans from $2.9 
billion to $36.5 billion annually. More-
over, in a February bulletin, the 
FINRA, the NASAA, and the SEC’s Of-
fice of Investor Education and Advo-
cacy noted that COVID–19’s unprece-
dented quarantines and social isolation 
may leave senior investors even more 
susceptible to financial fraud than ever 
before. 
This bill would establish a Senior In-
vestor Task Force within the U.S. Se-
curities and Exchange Commission. In 
coordination and consultation with 
State securities administrators, self- 
regulatory organizations, Federal law 
enforcement agencies, and others, the 
task force would be charged with iden-
tifying issues related to investors who 
are older than 65 years of age. The bill 
would also require biennial task force 
reports and require the GAO to com-
plete a study on senior financial ex-
ploitation. 
I strongly support the safety of 
America’s senior investors and their 
right to enjoy the retirement funds 
that they have worked so hard to earn. 
I also support regulators and law en-
forcement in holding fraudsters who 
prey upon the elderly accountable. 
It is for all these reasons I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting the 
Senior Security Act of 2021. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1565, the Senior Security Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1912 
April 19, 2021 
I would like to thank my colleagues, 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH of Indiana and Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER of New Jersey for their 
work on this important piece of bipar-
tisan legislation that will strengthen 
current efforts to protect senior inves-
tors. 
Madam Speaker, American capital 
markets provide every mom-and-pop 
investor with the opportunity to real-
ize the American Dream. Our capital 
markets allow individuals and families 
to grow their nest egg for retirement, 
their children to have an opportunity 
for college tuition, or to save and pur-
chase a home. 
Moreover, as Americans age, they are 
an important part of the success and 
vibrancy of the U.S. capital markets. 
In fact, Americans over the age of 50 
already account for roughly 77 percent 
of financial assets in the United States. 
To that end, fraud and exploitation of 
any 
kind 
in 
our 
capital 
markets 
threatens the integrity of our markets 
and harm investors seeking to build 
their nest eggs. 
It is especially problematic when the 
fraud targets senior investors. Pro-
tecting senior investors and preventing 
such predatory behavior within our fi-
nancial markets is a goal that we all 
share, regardless of party. This bill will 
support the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s current efforts to protect 
against increasing instances of finan-
cial exploitation against senior inves-
tors. 
H.R. 1565 creates an interdivisional 
task force at the Securities and Ex-
change Commission to examine and 
identify challenges faced by senior in-
vestors. 
We already have some data on senior 
citizens who are targeted by financial 
exploitation. 
These 
statistics 
are 
alarming. Older Americans lose up to 
$36 billion each year to financial scams 
and abuse. One in five seniors have re-
ported being victims of exploitation, 
and only a small number of cases of fi-
nancial abuse are even reported. The 
rates of exploitation are only rising. In 
fact, The New England Journal of Med-
icine calls elder financial exploitation 
a virtual epidemic. 
There are concerns that the COVID– 
19 pandemic has only exacerbated the 
trend. In addition to Congress, many 
States are already taking action, and 
that is a good thing. 
This bipartisan bill is an important 
step for the Federal Government. The 
bill requires the SEC to identify cur-
rent issues and challenges facing senior 
investors and to make policy rec-
ommendations for addressing these 
issues harming senior investors. 
Madam Speaker, protecting senior 
investors and safeguarding the integ-
rity of our financial markets are objec-
tives I believe we can get behind. In 
our duty to protect our constituents, 
especially those most vulnerable who 
contribute so much to society, we need 
to be helpful and supportive. For that 
reason, I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1600 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER), who is a 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I am honored to rise in support of the 
bipartisan Senior Security Act, which 
will help protect vulnerable seniors 
from hucksters and scam artists. I 
would like to thank my good friend, 
Congressman TREY HOLLINGSWORTH, for 
working with me on this crucial bill, 
and also Senators SUSAN COLLINS and 
KYRSTEN SINEMA, who have introduced 
companion legislation in the Senate. 
Since I took office, I have been com-
mitted to helping seniors save their 
hard-earned 
money 
for 
retirement, 
helping them cut their taxes and afford 
prescription drugs, and protecting So-
cial Security and Medicare so that, at 
the end of the day, they can afford to 
stay in northern New Jersey and enjoy 
their lives with their friends, children, 
and grandchildren. 
Unfortunately, far too many of our 
seniors have had their hard-earned re-
tirement savings stolen right out from 
under them when a scammer calls or 
shows up at their door. There are mil-
lions of seniors across the country who 
have been the victims of financial 
scams and abuses. It is appalling; it is 
offensive; and it is unacceptable. 
Older Americans lose approximately 
$3 billion each year to financial scams 
and abuse. Approximately 7 million 
Americans have been victims of exploi-
tation, and that is only what is being 
reported. Only 1 in every 24 cases of 
elder abuse actually gets reported. 
IRS impersonation calls and fraudu-
lent tech support calls are among the 
most widely used and costly scams tar-
geting older Americans. In fact, more 
than 2.5 million Americans have been 
targeted by scammers impersonating 
IRS officials, costing more than 15,800 
taxpayers at least $80 million since 
2013. More than 3 million Americans 
are victims of tech support scams or 
scammers pretending to be with a rep-
utable tech company who persuade sen-
iors to provide personal bank account 
information. 
My mom was even a victim of one of 
these scammers. Someone claiming to 
be an IRS agent threatened her. I re-
member she called me and thought 
that I had messed up her tax return, 
but it was a scammer. 
COVID scammers are also now tar-
geting older Americans with promises 
of quicker access to vaccines or pan-
demic relief benefits, preying on those 
whose only wish is to hug their family 
members again. 
We are here today to do something 
about it by voting on the Senior Secu-
rity Act to help protect American sen-
iors from scams. My bipartisan bill cre-
ates a new senior investor task force at 
the SEC to fight back against these 
hucksters scamming our seniors. The 
task force will also identify challenges 
that senior investors encounter and 
areas within the SEC or self-regulatory 
organizations where senior investors 
would benefit from changes. 
The task force will also coordinate 
with other Federal regulators, State 
regulators, and law enforcement to en-
sure that we are doing as much as we 
can at every level of government to 
stop this. Our legislation will also 
make antifraud enforcement even more 
common by giving law enforcement 
stronger tools and information via the 
new senior investor task force. 
The task force will submit regular re-
ports to Congress, outlining trends 
that are impacting senior investors. 
This will be a cop on the beat to make 
sure we keep up with the changes in fi-
nancial scams and to be ahead of new 
issues as they arise. 
Our seniors have given us so much. 
We should always have their backs and 
help protect them from predators who 
want to take advantage of them during 
their twilight years. I urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense, 
bipartisan bill. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. HOL-
LINGSWORTH), the coauthor of this bill. 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of this legislation. 
As I travel the district and travel 
across the State, I constantly get 
asked two very important questions: 
What is Washington doing for Ameri-
cans? And, what is happening on a bi-
partisan basis in Washington, D.C.? 
When I travel back home this Thurs-
day, I will be able to answer that this 
legislation checks both of those boxes. 
I am deeply proud to work with my 
good friend, Mr. GOTTHEIMER, on this 
important legislation to keep our sen-
ior citizens safe from fraudsters and 
hucksters who are constantly pursuing 
them. 
Much has been spoken already in this 
Chamber about the ‘‘what’’ of this bill, 
but I wanted to emphasize the ‘‘why.’’ 
It is for the 74-year-old Hoosier walk-
ing through our Jeffersonville office 
who has lost her life savings because 
she thought she was interfacing with 
the IRS. 
It is for the senior couple walking 
through our Franklin doors thinking 
they were helping get their grandson 
out of jail but, instead, were dealing 
with a huckster. 
It is for all the senior citizens across 
this country who are constantly get-
ting the calls, constantly getting the 
phishing emails, constantly seeing text 
messages trying to get at their life sav-
ings. Those are the ones who report it. 
As Mr. GOTTHEIMER said, only 1 in 24 of 
these crimes gets reported. 
This is something we have to end. We 
have to get one step ahead. I can’t wait 
to travel back home to the Hoosier 
State later this week and tell them 
this Chamber advanced a piece of legis-
lation to protect our senior citizens, to 
protect Americans, and to get us one 
step ahead of those fraudsters. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1913 
April 19, 2021 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 1565, the Senior Security Act. 
This commonsense legislation will 
provide much-needed information for 
policymakers and regulators to fine- 
tune protections for elderly investors. 
In south Texas, where we share the 
deep value of respect for our elders, we 
say society is judged on how we care 
for our parents, our grandparents, and 
beyond. We all know how closely finan-
cial health is tied to overall well-being. 
I am proud to support this legislation 
that equips us to identify better ways 
to protect our senior citizens and for 
them to protect themselves from fraud 
and scammers. 
This Senior Security Act aims to 
protect our seniors and prevent these 
attacks from happening. This legisla-
tion will build upon the Senior Safe 
Act by creating an interdivisional task 
force at the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to examine and identify 
challenges facing seniors and investors. 
Within 2 years of enactment, the U.S. 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
must study and report the economic 
costs of the financial exploitation of 
our seniors. Let’s be clear: Scammers 
will stop at nothing to take advantage 
of our seniors, and it is up to us in this 
House to stop them. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my con-
gressional colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this important piece of legisla-
tion, and I urge its passage. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1565 will help our 
financial regulators better protect our 
Nation’s seniors and the retirement 
funds they spent their entire lives 
building. I urge all of my colleagues to 
stand up for senior investors and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1865. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 1565, the ‘‘Senior Se-
curity Act,’’ which will help stop financial pred-
ators from scamming seniors out of their sav-
ings by creating a federal Senior Investor 
Taskforce within the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) to strengthen protections 
and safeguards for senior investors. 
This legislation will establish the Senior In-
vestor Taskforce at the SEC, which will be 
charged with identifying problems senior in-
vestors encounter, including financial exploi-
tation and cognitive decline, as well as identi-
fying regulatory changes that could help senior 
investors. 
The established Senior Investor Taskforce 
will be required to: 
Identify challenges that senior investors en-
counter, including problems associated with fi-
nancial exploitation and cognitive decline; 
Identify areas in which senior investors 
would benefit from changes at the Commis-
sion or the rules of self-regulatory organiza-
tions; 
Coordinate, as appropriate, with other of-
fices 
within 
the 
Commission 
and 
other 
taskforces that may be established within the 
Commission, self-regulatory organizations, and 
the Elder Justice Coordinating Council; 
Consult, as appropriate, with state securities 
and law enforcement authorities, state insur-
ance regulators, and other federal agencies; 
and 
Submit a biennial report to Congress. 
Every day, and far too often, vulnerable 
seniors in Texas and across the country fall 
victim to financial scammers. 
Seniors have worked their entire lives with 
the promise of a safe and secure retirement, 
but unfortunately criminals are taking advan-
tage of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic 
and working overtime to target them. 
No senior should ever have to worry that 
picking up the phone could mean being 
scammed out of thousands of dollars, but un-
fortunately, for too many members of our com-
munities, that is exactly what is happening. 
Retirement accounts are not the only dam-
age these scams target—they damage the 
independence and trust of a vulnerable com-
munity. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we have 
seen instances of fraud rise in unprecedented 
numbers, as scammers attempt to take advan-
tage of senior citizens and deprive them of 
their hard-earned savings. 
Bad actors preying on older Americans is, 
unfortunately, nothing new, but in the midst of 
a global pandemic impacting Americans’ lives 
and livelihoods, cracking down on those 
scams must be a priority. 
One such scam was thwarted by Houston 
police and the Harris County District Attorney, 
who made an arrest in February in an inter-
national cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, 
mostly elderly victims out of more than $1 mil-
lion. 
According to a report from the Senate Spe-
cial Committee on Aging released last Con-
gress, older Americans lose approximately $3 
billion each year to financial scams and 
abuse. 
Although 1 in 20 seniors in the U.S. is a tar-
get of fraud schemes, the National Adult Pro-
tective Services Association has found that 
only 1 in 44 seniors report-that they are vic-
tims of a fraud scheme. 
Fraudulent IRS impersonation and tech sup-
port calls are among the common and costly 
scams, and according to the Treasury Inspec-
tor General for Tax Administration, more than 
2.5 million Americans have been targeted by 
scammers impersonating IRS officials. 
Since 2013, more than 15,800 taxpayers 
have lost at least $80 million from this type of 
scam alone. 
Furthermore, Microsoft estimates that more 
than 3 million Americans are victims of tech-
nical support scams, where scammers pretend 
to be with a reputable tech company and per-
suade seniors to provide personal and bank 
information. 
Although we do know a few statistics, the 
lack of good, recent data on senior financial 
exploitation is a problem that H.R. 1565 would 
significantly aid in resolving. 
For this reason, I urge all members to join 
me in voting to pass H.R. 1565, the Fraud and 
Scam Reduction Act, which is critical to pro-
tecting seniors’ hard-earned savings and stop-
ping fraudulent schemes before it is too late. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TAKANO). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 1565. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

(a) STUDY.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Securities and Ex-
change Commission shall carry out a study 
of whether Rule 10b5–1 (17 CFR 240.10b5–1) 
should be amended to— 
(A) limit the ability of issuers and issuer 
insiders to adopt a plan described under 
paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(A)(3)

issuer insider is permitted to buy or sell se-
curities during issuer-adopted trading win-
dows; 
(B) limit the ability of issuers and issuer 
insiders to adopt multiple trading plans;

the adoption of a trading plan and the execu-
tion of the first trade pursuant to such a 
plan and, if so and depending on the Commis-
sion’s findings with respect to subparagraph 
(A)— 
(i) whether any such delay should be the 
same for trading plans adopted during an 
issuer-adopted trading window as opposed to 
outside of such a window; and 
(ii) whether any exceptions to such a delay 
are appropriate; 
(D) limit the frequency that issuers and 
issuer insiders may modify or cancel trading 
plans; 
(E) require issuers and issuer insiders to 
file with the Commission trading plan adop-
tions, amendments, terminations and trans-

(F) require boards of issuers that have 
adopted a trading plan to— 
(i) adopt policies covering trading plan 
practices; 
(ii) 
periodically 
monitor 
trading 
plan 
transactions; and 
(iii) ensure that issuer policies discuss 
trading plan use in the context of guidelines 
or requirements on equity hedging, holding, 
and ownership.

(c) RULEMAKING.—After the completion of 
the study required under subsection (a), the 
Commission shall, subject to public notice 
and comment, revise Rule 10b5–1 consistent 
with the results of such study. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1528, the Pro-
moting Transparent Standards for Cor-
porate Insiders Act, is a bill introduced 
by Chairwoman MAXINE
WATERS
for 
several Congresses to strengthen con-
fidence in our capital markets by en-
suring everyone plays by the same 
rules. 
This bill passed with overwhelming 
bipartisan support in the last Congress 
and is designed to promote strong en-
forcement against financial fraud by 
ensuring corporate executives cannot 
indirectly or illegally trade on mate-
rial nonpublic information they know 
about their companies. 
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, the SEC, prohibits insider 
trading as a fraud that hurts investors 
as well as the integrity of our capital 
markets. Those accused of illegal in-
sider trading sometimes defend them-
selves using the SEC’s rule for trading 
plans and claim any trades that oc-
curred while they possessed inside in-
formation were made pursuant to a 
preapproved trading plan. But the rule 
for trading plans has several short-
comings and loopholes that may allow 
corporate insiders to get away with in-
sider trading. 
This bill would require the SEC to 
study whether to amend its rule for 
trading plans to limit the ability of 
corporate insiders to, for example, 
adopt multiple overlapping plans or 
change their plans to indirectly take 
advantage of inside information. This 
bill would then require the SEC to re-
port to Congress and revise its rules 
based on the results of the study. 
This bill is needed to protect con-
fidence in our markets. For example, 
last year, we saw numerous pharma-
ceutical executives profiting from con-
veniently timed announcements re-
garding the companies’ progress to-
ward a COVID–19 vaccine. 
For instance, shortly after Moderna 
announced positive results for its vac-
cine, the pharmaceutical company’s 
CEO altered his trading plan to in-
crease the number of shares sold 
through the plan. Shortly thereafter, 
he sold shares for millions of dollars in 
profit. 
Similarly, on the same day Pfizer an-
nounced positive data regarding its 
vaccine, Pfizer’s CEO sold more than $5 
million worth of shares as part of his 
trading plan. 
This bill is supported by investor and 
consumer advocates, public pension 
funds, and State securities regulators, 
including the California Public Em-
ployees’ Retirement System, the Coun-
cil of Institutional Investors, and the 
North American Securities Adminis-
trators Association. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bipar-
tisan bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1528, 
the 
Promoting 
Transparent 
Standards for Corporate Insiders Act. 
As my colleague stated, this is bipar-
tisan legislation that strikes an impor-
tant balance. It protects retail inves-
tors in the market from illicit insider 
trading while, at the same time, ensur-
ing that the rules governing insider 
trading are clear, fair, and not prohibi-
tively onerous. 
I thank my colleagues for supporting 
this bill last Congress, and I think they 
should do so this Congress. Thwarting 
and punishing fraud and abuse within 
our financial markets is not a Repub-
lican or Democrat issue. This includes 
illegal insider trading. When a cor-
porate insider gains an unfair advan-
tage by violating current insider trad-
ing rules and trading on material non-
public information, that illegal behav-
ior harms Main Street investors. 
b 1615 
It harms those who diligently put 
their hard-earned money aside for re-
tirement. 
It is important to note that not every 
corporate insider or executive trading 
in the stock of his or her company is a 
bad actor. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s current rules and guide-
lines allow corporate insiders to pur-
chase and sell securities of their com-
pany without fear of insider trading li-
ability. Most corporate insiders care-
fully follow this rule called rule 10b5–1, 
and they follow it to the letter of the 
law. 
Moreover, this rule ensures that in-
sider trading guidelines are fair tools 
when properly followed. These rules are 
designed to allow corporate insiders to 
liquidate their stock options when 
needed, such as when trying to pay for 
a child’s education, buying a house, or 
paying medical expenses. 
Furthermore, allowing insiders to 
purchase and sell securities at a pre-
determined time on a scheduled basis 
under rule 10b5–1 ensures market sta-
bility. 
This rule also decreases the risk of 
volatility by preventing fraudulent be-
havior, such as the so-called pump-and- 
dump schemes that some have tried to 
take advantage of. 
This bill requires the SEC to study 
whether this current rule should be 
amended. In studying the rule, the SEC 
is directed to consider how any amend-
ments would clarify and enhance exist-
ing prohibitions against insider trad-
ing. Importantly, though, the bill also 
requires the SEC to weigh any poten-
tial amendments against the important 
benefits of this rule. 
The SEC is also directed to consider 
what effects amending the rules would 
have on attracting qualified candidates 
for open insider positions, such as cap-
ital formation, and a company’s will-
ingness to go public. 
I am pleased that this is a bipartisan 
legislation that thoughtfully balances 
the meaningful goals of protecting ev-
eryday investors with facilitating eco-
nomic growth opportunities, and I 
think that ensures that we keep a 
healthy capital markets function here 
in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers on my side, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1528, which will help 
prevent corporate insiders from using 
inside information to rig the game in 
their favor at the expense of investors 
and the integrity of our markets. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
PERLMUTTER) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1528. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SEC. 12. BANKING SERVICES FOR HEMP-RELATED 
LEGITIMATE 
BUSINESSES 
AND 
HEMP-RELATED 
SERVICE 
PRO-
VIDERS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
(1) the Agriculture Improvement Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–334) legalized hemp by 
removing it from the definition of ‘‘mari-
huana’’ under the Controlled Substances 
Act; 
(2) despite the legalization of hemp, some 
hemp businesses (including producers, manu-
facturers, and retailers) continue to have dif-
ficulty gaining access to banking products 
and services; and 
(3) businesses involved in the sale of hemp- 
derived CBD products are particularly af-
fected, due to confusion about the legal sta-
tus of such products. 
(b) FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS’ HEMP 
BANKING GUIDANCE.—Not later than the end 
of the 90-day period beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Federal banking 
regulators shall update their existing guid-
ance, as applicable, regarding the provision 
of financial services to hemp-related legiti-
mate businesses and hemp-related service 
providers to address— 
(1) compliance with financial institutions’ 
existing obligations under Federal laws and 
implementing regulations determined rel-
evant by the Federal banking regulators, in-
cluding subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, 
United States Code, and its implementing 
regulation in conformity with this Act and 
the Department of Agriculture’s rules regu-
lating domestic hemp production (7 C.F.R. 
990); and 
(2) best practices for financial institutions 
to follow when providing financial services, 
including processing payments, to hemp-re-
lated legitimate businesses and hemp-related 
service providers.

SEC. 15. DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS FUNDS. 
Section 7(a)(3)(A) of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 289(a)(3)(A)) is amended by re-
ducing the dollar figure by $6,000,000. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 1996. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud we are here 
today to pass this bill about public 
safety, accountability, and respecting 
States’ rights. Forty-seven States, four 
U.S. territories, and the District of Co-
lumbia have spoken and legalized some 
form of recreational or medical can-
nabis, including CBD products. 318 mil-
lion people live in those 47 States. That 
is 97.7 percent of the population of 
America. 
However, because cannabis remains 
illegal under Federal law, the Con-
trolled Substance Act, businesses in 
these States are forced to deal in cash; 
and the businesses, their employees, 
and ancillary businesses can’t access 
the banking system. 
The fact is that the people in States 
and localities across the country are 
voting to approve some level of can-
nabis use, and we need these cannabis 
businesses and employees to have ac-
cess to checking accounts, payroll ac-
counts, lines of credit, credit cards, and 
more. This will improve transparency 
and accountability and help law en-
forcement root out illegal transactions 
to prevent tax evasion, money laun-
dering, and other white-collar crime. 
Most importantly, this will reduce 
the risk of violent crime in our com-
munities. These businesses and their 
employees become targets for crime, 
robbery, assault, and more by dealing 
in all cash, and this puts the employees 
and the store owners at risk. 
Over the last year in Oregon alone, a 
string of more than 100 robberies and 
burglaries at cannabis businesses cul-
minated in a murder when Michael Ar-
thur, a dispensary employee, was shot 
to death during a robbery. 
Just last week in Colorado, an inno-
cent bystander was shot during an at-
tempted break-in at a medical can-
nabis business. And in Colorado, we are 
always reminded of Travis Mason, the 
young father and Marine Corps vet, 
who was murdered while working as a 
security guard for a cannabis business. 
We must do better for these employ-
ees, their families, and all our commu-
nities. 
The SAFE Banking Act will create a 
safe harbor for financial institutions 
and their employees who choose to do 
business with a cannabis company. 
Section 3 of the bill is particularly im-
portant to not only cannabis busi-
nesses, but everyone who might do 
business with a cannabis-related com-
pany. This section would protect ancil-
lary businesses, like real estate own-
ers, accountants, electricians, and ven-
dors, by clarifying the proceeds from 
legitimate cannabis businesses are not 
unlawful under Federal laws. This pro-
ceeds section is the key provision al-
lowing all cannabis-related businesses 
and their service providers and land-
lords to access the banking system 
without fear of reprisal. 
This bill now has 177 bipartisan co-
sponsors, and one-third of the Senate is 
cosponsoring the companion bill from 
Senators MERKLEY and DAINES. 
Last Congress, the SAFE Banking 
Act passed the House 321–103, with the 
support of 91 Republicans. The broad 
base of support for this legislation gen-
erated a diverse group of cosponsors 
and 
endorsing 
organizations 
from 
banking, credit union, and insurance 
trade associations to labor unions, can-
nabis businesses and advocates, and 
State government leaders. 
There are, obviously, many more 
marijuana issues we need to address 
working together, including additional 
research, tax issues, and criminal jus-
tice reforms. Passing this bill will show 
that Congress can work together in a 
bipartisan way to address outdated 
marijuana laws. I hope this bill is an 
icebreaker for the House to take up 
other reforms and finally remove the 
conflict between State and Federal 
laws. 
In summary, even if you are opposed 
to the legalization of cannabis, you 
should support this bill. American vot-
ers have spoken and continue to speak, 
and the fact is that you can’t put the 
genie back in the bottle. Prohibition is 
over. The SAFE Banking Act is focused 
solely on taking cash off the streets 
and making our communities safer, 
and only Congress can take these steps 
to provide this certainty for busi-
nesses, employees, and financial insti-
tutions across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, STIVERS, DAVIDSON, JOYCE, 
CORREA, and BLUMENAUER
for their 
partnership on this bill and their com-
mitment to making our communities 
safer. I also thank Representatives 
LUETKEMEYER, BARR, and PORTER for 
their contributions to the text of this 
bill and their support. Finally, I thank 
Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS for her 
support over the years and for con-
tinuing to make this a priority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the SAFE 
Banking Act, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 1996. 
I want to begin by commending my 
colleague from Colorado, Mr. PERL-
MUTTER, for the way that he has ap-
proached this legislation. He is incor-
porating a lot of ideas from Members 
all across this Chamber and from 
across the country. He has doggedly 
pursued 
this 
legislation 
for 
many 
years, and I want to commend him for 
that. 
I also want to thank my colleagues, 
Mr. STIVERS and Mr. JOYCE of Ohio, for 
the way they have approached this bill. 
I think this is a testament to construc-
tive criticism of a bill and it becoming 
better as a result of it. 
Let me say, regardless of your posi-
tion on this bill, I do think the fact re-
mains that cannabis is a prohibited 
substance under schedule I of the Con-
trolled Substances Act. 
Let me further state that, by enact-
ing this legislation, we are effectively 
kneecapping law enforcement in legal-
izing money laundering. These are con-
cerns that I have, that still remain. 
By effectively legalizing money laun-
dering, we are inserting a new level of 
risk in our financial system. We are 
preventing our legal entities from 
doing their jobs. We are encouraging 
bad actors and placing our financial in-
stitutions at risk. 
Rather than dealing with the issues 
of cannabis and the question of its Fed-
eral legalization, we are dealing with a 
component of the challenge, which is 
the banking of it, and it is a challenge. 
I think we are adding a new risk to our 
banking system and our anti-money 
laundering reforms that we passed just 
in January of this year. That seems 
counterintuitive to me. 
For years, Congress has worked to re-
form our anti-money laundering laws. 
Now, in one fell swoop, we are undoing 
a lot of that hard work and we are 
going to make it easier for money 
launderers. 
If you want to help the system, if you 
want to give financial institutions the 
certainty and security they want and 
need to do the job with the cannabis in-
dustry, where it is legalized in these

H1919 
April 19, 2021 
States, we should debate the merits of 
cannabis remaining a schedule I sub-
stance, not pass a bill that skirts 
around the substance of the issue. 
This bill we are considering today is 
one of the biggest changes to U.S. drug 
policy, yet it was done with little de-
bate this Congress. There has been a 
lot of debate overall in this Congress, 
far more than the Senate has even had, 
on the question of cannabis. 
This bill, which is really the first 
step in legalizing cannabis at the Fed-
eral level, was reported out of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee last Con-
gress, and it is a committee that really 
has no jurisdiction over the Controlled 
Substances Act. We only had one hear-
ing featuring one panel of witnesses. 
We haven’t had a hearing this Congress 
to discuss changes over the last 2 
years, let alone a markup to discuss 
any changes that might strengthen or 
impact the bill. 
For example, late last year, Congress 
passed a sweeping bipartisan anti- 
money laundering piece of legislation. 
These reforms include prohibitions on 
the concealment of sources of assets in 
monetary transactions; a prohibition, I 
will add, that comes with a steep pen-
alty of up to 10 years in prison and up 
to $1 million in fines. 
If we were doing our due diligence, 
we would have done a deeper discussion 
on how these new AML Act changes 
would impact banks working with can-
nabis industries as clients instead of 
me raising this issue at the eleventh 
hour on the floor, which is what I have 
got to resort to. 
In addition to this concern, I believe 
I have voiced many other concerns, in-
cluding our need to better comprehend 
and address the supervisory and regu-
latory issues that would result from 
enactment of H.R. 1996. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from Ranking Member LUETKE-
MEYER of the Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Financial Insti-
tutions and myself as ranking member 
of the full Committee on Financial 
Services. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, March 21, 2019. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman, Subcommittee on Consumer Protec-
tion and Financial Institutions, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS AND CHAIRMAN 
MEEKS: We write today to seek your agree-
ment to delay consideration of H.R. 1595, the 
SAFE Act, currently scheduled to be marked 
up on March 26, 2019, until the Committee 
has a better understanding of the full range 
of consequences that enacting such legisla-
tion may trigger. As you know, marijuana is 
a schedule I controlled substance as defined 
in 21 U.S.C. § 802. The impact that many 
state laws, which have legalized marijuana, 
have on the federal laws governing the man-
ufacturing, use, and sale of marijuana, in-
cluding proceeds, raise many questions and 
concerns. Any change to these statutes, or 
those that impact them, has the potential to 
divide the Congress and the country. We 
must ensure that Congress has done its due 
diligence, including conducting thorough 
oversight and review, before moving such 
legislation. 
The hearing at the Committee on Finan-
cial Services on February 13, 2019, made clear 
that we need to better comprehend and ad-
dress the supervisory and regulatory issues 
that would result from enactment of H.R. 
1595. Many outstanding questions remain, 
which include but are not limited to the fol-
lowing: 
1. What changes to our banking laws are 
necessary to implement the SAFE Banking 
Act or other legislation creating a safe har-
bor for cannabis-related businesses? 
2. How would individual agencies enforce

As Members of Congress, and the Com-
mittee of primary jurisdiction, we owe it to 
our constituents and to the public to fully 
understand the implications of any legisla-
tion before supporting or opposing it. We 
urge you to hold H.R. 1595 and any related 
legislation until we have a full under-
standing of the consequences of this bill. 
Sincerely, 
PATRICK MCHENRY 
Ranking Member. 
BLAINE LUETKEMEYER, 
Ranking Member. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this let-
ter raises a number of concerns, includ-
ing: 
What changes to our banking laws 
are necessary to implement the SAFE 
Banking Act, a number of questions 
that I have; 
What agencies are going to be nec-
essary for this working group to actu-
ally ensure that the letter of this law 
is adhered to by the executive branch, 
that they actually follow it as the 
writer of the legislation intends; 
How the executive branch will inter-
pret the ‘‘know your customer’’ rules 
enacted in the SAFE Banking Act, 
compared to what we enacted just 2 
months ago, 3 months ago; 
How we would deal with suspicious 
activity reporting requirements under 
the new guidelines of the SAFE Bank-
ing Act, compared to what we enacted 
at the end of last year; 
How we deal with currency trans-
action reports under this law, com-
pared to what we just passed; and 
What 
are 
the 
implications 
on 
nonbank financial firms as well, such 
as insurers and investment companies. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the author of 
the bill intends for insurers and invest-
ment companies and banks to have the 
same qualifications when they are han-
dling money that has touched the can-
nabis industry. I think that is the in-
tent. 
b 1630 
Mr. Speaker, I think we need to un-
derstand whether or not the adminis-
tration would follow that intent that 
the author has stated clearly in de-
bates here on the House floor last Con-
gress and this Congress and, further-
more, whether or not Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement will have a 
similar interpretation that the writer 
of this bill says is his intent, that Fed-
eral law enforcement should hear the 
voice of Congress and hear this step to 
legalization which is part of this bill. 
I do not think it is the author of the 
bill’s idea to get into sort of the broad-
er conversation about legalization at 
the State level and what we should do 
at the Federal level in this bill. How-
ever, that is a part of it. 
In March of 2019, the National Sher-
iffs’ Association voiced concern with 
this bill, saying that it could easily be 
exploited. They echoed my concerns 
that ‘‘allowing banking access for a 
Schedule 1 drug gives money laun-
dering access to international drug car-
tels, which are already using the cover 
of legalization.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include that letter in 
the RECORD.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

April 19, 2021 
NATIONAL SHERIFFS’ ASSOCIATION, 
March 19, 2019. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, House of Representatives, Com-
mittee on Financial Services, Washington, 
DC. 
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, 
Ranking Member, House of Representatives, 
Committee on Financial Services, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS
AND RANKING 
MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of the National 
Sheriffs’ Association (NSA) and more than 
3,080 sheriffs nationwide, I write to express 
our deep concern and opposition to H.R. 1595, 
The SAFE Banking Act. This bill creates 
protections for depository institutions that 
provide financial services to cannabis-re-
lated businesses and service providers for 
such businesses. 
H.R. 1595 will increase the legalization of 
marijuana across the Nation, which we un-
derstand is an intended consequence of this 
bill. Furthermore, allowing banking access 
for a Schedule 1 drug gives money laundering 
access to international drug cartels, which 
are already using the cover of legalization. 
This will inevitably open the door to other 
criminal activity! 
NSA is concerned with the welfare and 
safety of citizens and works to preserve their 
rights to live and work in communities 
where drug abuse is not accepted and they 
are not subjected to the adverse effects of 
drug abuse. The dangers of illegal drugs, in-
cluding marijuana, and the threat to public 
safety caused by their use in terms of high-
way safety, criminal activity, and domestic 
violence are well-documented. 
NSA believes that any legislation regard-
ing national legalization must engage the 
nation’s law enforcement agencies in order 
to have a comprehensive discussion regard-
ing the potential implications this bill could 
have on our communities. We urge The 
House of Representatives to defeat this dan-
gerous bill. 
Sincerely, 
JONATHAN F. THOMPSON, 
Executive Director and CEO. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Furthermore, we see 
cannabis-legal States like California, 
Washington, and Colorado, as the sub-
ject of recent news reports that cartels 
have found that it is easier to grow and 
process marijuana in legal States like 
Colorado and ship it throughout the 
United States than it is to bring it 
from Mexico or Cuba. I include that ar-
ticle in the RECORD, Mr. Speaker. 
[From Global Power, May 29, 2018] 
FOREIGN CARTELS EMBRACE HOME-GROWN 
MARIJUANA IN POT-LEGAL STATES 
(By Dennis Romero, Gabe Gutierrez, Andrew 
Blankstein and Robert Powell) 
LOS
ANGELES.—General 
Jeff 
Sessions 
called it ‘‘one of the largest residential for-
feiture actions in American history.’’ 
In early April, local and federal authorities 
descended upon 74 marijuana grow houses in 
the Sacramento area they say were under-
written by Chinese organized crime. They 
filed court paperwork to seize the properties, 
worth millions of dollars. 
Federal officials allege that legal rec-
reational marijuana states like California, 
Colorado and Washington, where enforce-
ment of growing regulations is hit-or-miss, 
have been providing cover for transnational 
criminal organizations willing to invest big 
money to buy or rent property to achieve 
even bigger returns. 
Chinese, Cuban and Mexican drug rings 
have purchased or rented hundreds of homes 
and use human trafficking to bring inexperi-
enced growers to the United States to tend 
them, federal and local officials say. 
The suspects are targeting states that have 
already legalized marijuana ‘‘in an attempt 
to shroud their operations in our legal envi-
ronment here and then take the marijuana 
outside of the state,’’ said Mike Hartman, 
executive director of the Colorado Depart-
ment of Revenue, which regulates and li-
censes the cannabis industry. Authorities 
say they’ve seen an increase in these ‘‘home 
grows’’ since the launch of recreational pot 
sales in Colorado. 
While California and Washington have 
mainly seen organized criminals from China 
buying homes and converting them into 
grow houses, Colorado has largely been grap-
pling with Cuban and Mexican-led cartels, 
said Sheriff Bill Elder of the El Paso County 
Sheriffs Office in Colorado. 
‘‘They have found that it’s easier to grow 
and process marijuana in Colorado, ship it 
throughout the United States, than it is to 
bring it from Mexico or Cuba,’’ Elder said. 
A ‘MASSIVE’ MARIJUANA NETWORK 
In El Paso County, NBC News witnessed 
firsthand the damage a commercial-scale 
cannabis grow can do to a home otherwise 
built for an average American family. Grow-
ers pose as legitimate renters, and by the 
time authorities disrupt their operation, 
homes have been gutted and trashed. 
‘‘We’ve fallen through floors,’’ U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency Special Agent Randy 
Ladd said. ‘‘The electrical damage, they 
draw so much current that you’ll see, in 
some places, the wires are fused inside of the 
electrical box. And—a lot of people—they 
don’t wanna pay the high electric bills. So 
what they do is they take jackhammers and 
pickaxes and they cut through the founda-
tion of the house, so that they could steal 
the power.’’ 
One of the biggest busts so far came last 
June, when the Colorado attorney general’s 
office announced that ‘‘a massive illegal 
interstate marijuana distribution and cul-
tivation network stretching from Colorado 
to Texas’’ had been dismantled. It was alleg-
edly Chinese-connected, Ladd said. 
Authorities said the network was respon-
sible for securities fraud, millions of dollars 
of 
laundered 
cash, 
2,600 
‘‘illegally 
cul-
tivated’’ marijuana plants and 4,000 pounds 
of harvested cannabis, according to the Colo-
rado attorney general’s statement. 
The operation took place in 18 warehouses 
and storage units and 33 homes, mostly in 
the Denver area, authorities said. ‘‘These 
seizures are believed to only scratch the sur-
face,’’ the office said. 
Ladd alleged that some Chinese crews 
cover immigrants’ costs of traveling to 
America in exchange for work in the grow 
houses. ‘‘It’s like indentured servitude,’’ he 
said. ‘‘It is a form of human trafficking.’’ 
The workers often fly from China to Bel-
gium, and from Belgium to Mexico, before 
making asylum claims at the border and 
then disappearing by the time they’re sched-
uled to tell their stories in court, Ladd said. 
Often when grow houses are raided, immigra-
tion fugitives are discovered, he said. 
The grow homes are usually purchased by 
shell property management companies, Ladd 
said. ‘‘These growers can hide in plain 
sight,’’ he said. 
HOW FOREIGN CARTELS OPERATE IN THE U.S. 
The Sacramento-area raids, which also 
struck Calaveras, Placer, San Joaquin, El 
Dorado, Yuba and Amador counties, shed 
some light on how many of the foreign rings 
operate. 
Northern California-based DEA Special 
Agent Casey Rettig said suspects send cash 
to the United States in $9,999 increments, 
just below the mandated reporting threshold, 
and receive funds from China that fly under 
that nation’s $50,000 foreign spending limit. 
They then purchase homes with the help of 
cash lenders instead of traditional mortgage 
firms. 
Last fall, a scenario fitting that pattern 
unfolded in Grays Harbor County, Wash-
ington, southwest of Seattle, as a drug task 
force busted an alleged cultivation ring fund-
ed by organized crime in China. 
More than 40 suspects were arrested and 
$80 million worth of cannabis was seized, the 
Grays Harbor County Sheriff’s Office said. 
‘‘The majority of these homes were pur-
chased with cash, and information was devel-
oped that these purchases were conducted by 
Chinese nationals involved in organized 
crime,’’ according to a statement from the 
Sheriff’s Office. 
And just this month, search warrants were 
served at 19 locations in the Puget Sound 
area of Washington state, a federal official 
who did not want her name used said. The 
ring was allegedly run by three Chinese na-
tionals who produced thousands of pounds of 
cannabis destined for greater New York, the 
U.S. attorney’s office in Seattle alleges. 
The suspects, who face drug conspiracy 
charges, purchased homes with the help of 
multiple wire transfers from China that in-
cluded dollar figures—$2,000 to $5,900—they 
believed would fly under the radar, according 
to a federal complaint. 
Ultimately it was the houses’ exorbitant 
electricity use—up to 38,477 kilowatt hours 
in one day versus the American average of 
just 30—that made them targets of a federal 
investigation, according to the filing. 
Even a single grow house can contain a 
large marijuana operation. In April, police in 
Pomona, California, an exurb in Los Angeles 
County, announced they discovered a 23- 
room grow house allegedly run by Chinese 
nationals. 
Fifty-five-hundred 
marijuana 
products, including 2,900 plants and nearly 21 
pounds of cannabis, were seized, police said. 
‘‘The grow operation used advanced sys-
tems of lighting, air conditioning, fans, ex-
haust blowers and air-filtering systems to 
control the climate inside the buildings and 
the odor of marijuana,’’ according to a Po-
mona police statement. 
Pomona police spokeswoman Aly Mejia 
said a gun and $6,900 in cash were also found. 
The DEA’s Rettig, speaking from her base 
in San Francisco, said the Chinese oper-
ations are ‘‘illegal under state law.’’ In Cali-
fornia, marijuana growers, producers and re-
tailers need state and local licenses. Cities 
can opt out and ban such businesses alto-
gether. 
Rettig said even with the Golden State’s 
sky-high housing market—the median price 
of a home is $535,100, according listings site 
Zillow—overseas criminals know that ‘‘mari-
juana can fetch three times as much out of 
state.’’ 
‘‘There’s a great profit motive in it,’’ the 
DEA’s Ladd said. ‘‘In Colorado, marijuana le-
galization has magnified the black market. 
The standard price per pound here is $2,000, 
but they can get $3,500 to $4,500 by shipping 
it back East. The profits are great there.’’ 
Mr. MCHENRY. Furthermore, be-
cause of this patchwork at the State 
level, I think you are seeing additional 
concerns at the southern border right 
now, and I will include for the RECORD 
a letter that the former Border Patrol 
chief submitted that in February alone 
there was nearly $14 million a day of 
marijuana caught at the southern bor-
der. 
Despite these many issues I still have 
with the SAFE Banking Act, I do ap-
preciate the work that my colleagues

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1921 
April 19, 2021 
have put into this legislative effort, 
but considering that the larger issue of 
cannabis legalization has not yet been 
debated here on the House floor, I 
think it is premature for the Financial 
Services Committee to do the full work 
of this Congress on the question of can-
nabis legalization at the Federal level. 
I think that would be better left to the 
Judiciary Committee, with a wider de-
bate here on the House floor, and I 
would encourage that wider debate. 
Notwithstanding that, I would like to 
thank my colleagues for the hard work 
that they have put into this legisla-
tion. Even if I have concerns, I know 
that there is more than sufficient sup-
port to pass this under the suspension 
calendar, and that would not happen 
were it not for the good legislative 
work of my colleague and friend from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER). 
I do believe that my colleague was 
quite intentional about the date that 
he wanted to actually have the vote 
here on the House floor. With that, for 
those of you who don’t know, tomorrow 
is 4/20/21, 4/20 being the operative date. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina for his many compliments. I would 
just remind him, we are the Financial 
Services Committee. We have a certain 
amount of jurisdiction that deals with 
financial institutions and financial 
services, and that is what this bill is 
focused on, dealing with so much cash 
generated by this industry, whether we 
do anything or not, and to try to ad-
vance public safety in the process. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ), the chair of the Small 
Business Committee, who had a lot to 
do with writing the Small Business 
piece of this. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am 
a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 1996, 
the SAFE Banking Act, and I rise in 
strong support. 
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to recognize the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) for his ex-
traordinary leadership on this legisla-
tion. 
When the pandemic first hit and 
stay-at-home orders went into place, 
many small cannabis businesses were 
deemed essential. Yet, just as States 
recognized these businesses as critical, 
Federal law still fails to provide them 
the same access to key financial serv-
ices, like banking and insurance. 
H.R. 1996, the SAFE Banking Act, 
will address this problem, enabling 
them to grow and hire more workers. 
Failing to allow cannabis businesses to 
utilize financial products and services 
not only creates artificial barriers for 
these small businesses, it is also an 
issue of public safety, as these high- 
volume cash businesses are frequently 
the target of robberies and break-ins. 
That is why the SAFE Banking Act 
is so important and why, as chair of 
the House Small Business Committee 
and senior member of the Financial 
Services Committee, I am proud to 
stand by it since its first introduction. 
I thank Mr. PERLMUTTER for his lead-
ership. Let’s pass this legislation once 
and for all. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. STIVERS), the subcommittee chair 
on Housing, Community Development, 
and Insurance. 
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Congressman PERLMUTTER
for 
his hard work on this. I am an unlikely 
person to support this bill because I am 
opposed to recreational marijuana, but 
I came to this because a company that 
is just outside my district that sells 
nutrients now finds themselves in the 
situation where 25 percent of their 
profits come from selling to legal mari-
juana businesses, and they are being 
threatened, a Fortune 500 company, 
with losing their bank accounts. 
We can’t let that happen. We have 
got to make sure that we stand up for 
safety and stand up for common sense. 
That is what this bill does. 
Three points about this bill. Number 
one, 
it 
encourages 
safety 
because 
money that is in a bank account can be 
frozen and can be tracked. 
By the way, this bill also increases 
suspicious activity reports, so this idea 
about money laundering doesn’t work 
because there are suspicious activity 
reports that are expanded under the 
bill, and you can freeze and track the 
money, which is really important. That 
is why a lot of folks in law enforcement 
like this bill. 
The final thing is, this bill includes 
provisions to stop Operation Choke 
Point that Republicans couldn’t even 
get passed when we had the presidency, 
the Senate, and the House, and we got 
that negotiated into this bill. It helps 
in a big way to make sure that there’s 
not an Operation Choke Point in the 
future, so nobody can choke off legal 
businesses from their bank accounts 
and from access to the payments sys-
tem. That is a big deal. I want to thank 
Congressman PERLMUTTER for allowing 
that. 
Finally, before my time is up, I want 
to acknowledge Congressman WARREN 
DAVIDSON, who isn’t going to be able to 
fly in in time for this. Congressman 
DAVIDSON has been working on this bill 
with me for almost 2 years with Con-
gressman PERLMUTTER. WARREN DAVID-
SON has done an amazing job. I just 
want to acknowledge his hard work, all 
his efforts. We wouldn’t be here today 
but for Congressman WARREN DAVID-
SON. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1996. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
would also like to thank Mr. STIVERS 
for working with me so much over the 
last few years on this. I am going to 
miss him as he chooses to take another 
path in the near future. I just want to 
say on the floor, that he is a real credit 
to this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, the SAFE 
Banking Act can be summarized in 
three basic points. First of all, this 
measure does not legalize anything at 
the State level. Today, 47 States, four 
U.S. territories, and D.C., representing 
98 percent of the U.S. population, have 
legalized cannabis in one form or an-
other. 
Second, this is essentially a States’ 
rights issue. This measure essentially 
says that when a State legalizes can-
nabis, the Federal Government will re-
spect that decision when it comes to 
banking. 
Finally, this measure is essentially 
about helping our local police officers 
back home do their job safely and ef-
fectively. We already give our local po-
lice officers the impossible job of tak-
ing care of the homeless and the men-
tally ill, and now we are asking our po-
lice officers to protect the legalized 
cannabis industry, a cash business, 
from those criminals that would prey 
upon them. This just doesn’t make 
sense. 
Today, because of Federal law, the 
cannabis industry can only operate on 
a cash basis. They pay their Federal, 
State, and local taxes with cash. Let 
me repeat. Today, the cannabis indus-
try pays their Federal taxes with cash. 
They pay their employees with cash. 
They pay their rent with cash, and 
they pay their bills with cash. This is 
no way to keep our streets safe. 
Let’s help our local police officers 
keep our communities safe. Let’s get 
the cash out of the cannabis industry, 
and let’s pass H.R. 1996. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), the ranking member 
of the Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations of the House Financial 
Services Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the SAFE Banking Act. 
Kentuckians have a deep interest in 
the production, cultivation, and sale of 
nonintoxicating industrial hemp and 
hemp-derived products, including CBD. 
In fact, Kentucky boasts a proud herit-
age and agricultural tradition in indus-
trial hemp. Henry Clay, the great 
Speaker of the House who once rep-
resented the district that I now rep-
resent, was, in fact, an industrial hemp 
farmer. 
More recently, the Commonwealth 
has seen a revival in the industrial 
hemp industry, resulting 
in 
much 
growth and job creation in this area. 
Much of the growth of the industry oc-
curred as a result of the Industrial 
Hemp Research Pilot Program estab-
lished under the 2014 farm bill and the 
2018 farm bill, which took it a step fur-
ther and fully legalized industrial 
hemp. 
Despite these positive steps forward, 
hemp businesses still have trouble ac-
cessing certain financial services. Just 
today I spoke with a CBD retailer in 
my district who confirmed that while 
the situation has improved somewhat 
over the last few years, access to card

processing services is uneven and un-
certain. This bill will provide addi-
tional clarity for banks, insurance 
companies, and card processors that 
they can, in fact, do business with le-
gally operating hemp businesses. It 
would also direct our Federal financial 
regulators to update best practices for 
serving hemp and CBD businesses. 
Since we last debated this bill, condi-
tions have improved for hemp financ-
ing. In December 2019, financial regu-
lators jointly issued guidance con-
firming that banks are free to provide 
banking services to the hemp industry, 
just as they are for any other agricul-
tural commodity. Unfortunately, there 
is still work to do to ensure that these 
legal hemp businesses have full access 
to the financial system. There remains 
some ambiguity, specifically regarding 
payment 
processors’ 
dealings 
with 
hemp businesses. This bill makes need-
ed clarifications. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) for work-
ing across the aisle on this bill. He and 
his team took great care to ensure that 
these changes were incorporated into 
the bill and made the needed clarifica-
tions. I thank him for his cooperation. 
This will have a meaningful impact on 
Kentucky farmers, small businesses, 
and a burgeoning industry in Kentucky 
and across the country. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Kentucky 
for his work on this bill and his input 
on the card processing piece of the leg-
islation. 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). He has 
put the effort together across a whole 
range of cannabis issues. I thank him 
for his steadfast work on this subject. 
b 1645 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honor to be here with my friend, 
Mr. PERLMUTTER, and the bipartisan 
support that we are receiving from Mr. 
STIVERS. We are going to hear in a mo-
ment from the distinguished gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), who has been a 
champion. 
Sadly, I feel my good friend from 
North Carolina could have given his 
speech 25 years ago. The legalization 
train has left the station. This is a 
business in the United States that is 
approaching $20 billion of revenue this 
year. 
As has been pointed out, 97 percent of 
the American public has access to some 
form of legal cannabis. Medical can-
nabis, 4 million patients utilize it. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that has 
arrived, and it is being held captive of 
the past practice by pretending that 
the Federal Government can wish away 
the legalization of this subject. They 
can’t. The flawed Federal policies cre-
ate serious problems. 
As Mr. PERLMUTTER pointed out, we 
have had over 100 robberies in my com-
munity, including a fatality. These 
cash-only enterprises are sitting ducks 
for people who have nefarious aims. It 
is an invitation for money laundering 
now because of the vast amount of cash 
that is circulated. 
It impacts so many legitimate busi-
nesses, real estate, insurance, attor-
neys, accountants, who get caught up. 
We already heard reference to what 
happened to Mr. STIVERS’ constituent 
in Ohio, a business that provides gar-
dening supplies, that risks losing their 
bank account. 
It is time for us to address this in-
consistency. It is time for us to pass, 
again, the SAFE Banking Act. And it 
is time for us to move forward with le-
galization on the Federal level with the 
MORE Act, which will resolve these in-
consistencies. 
Once and for all, give the American 
people what they want and what they 
repeatedly vote for across the country. 
Unleash this State legal business to re-
alize its full potential for health, the 
economy, and a cry for racial justice. 
I appreciate us being at this point for 
a critical first step along the torturous 
path to full legalization, which I am 
confident will happen this Congress 
and not a moment too soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge 
the tragic passing of Steve Fox, a pioneering 
advocate, strategist, a true leader in the mari-
juana cannabis legalization effort. 
It is fitting today that we are passing the 
SAFE Banking Act. We wouldn’t be where we 
are today without Steve and his amazing ef-
forts. His life work, leadership, and strategic 
brilliance are unmatched. 
Passing this critical legislation today would 
be a small part of a fitting memorial for a man 
whose efforts made it possible, indeed, imper-
ative to solve this problem. 
I first met Steve as we were strategizing on 
the Oregon legalization effort. Back in 2013, 
after the Colorado legalization campaign that 
he orchestrated had passed and before Or-
egon joined the ranks of legalization, he was 
already a legend. He pioneered so much of 
the groundwork for the legalization movement 
that exploded after the success of the Colo-
rado campaign which owed so much to his 
strategic brilliance. 
Steve was thoughtful, hardworking, and self- 
effacing. While this has become a national 
movement with many leaders now emerging, 
none compare with Steve. Few will fully under-
stand his many contributions and importance. 
I for one will miss his genuine, quiet leader-
ship. 
As someone who’s been working on this 
longer than anyone in American politics, I 
know we are all deeply, deeply indebted to 
Steve. We mourn his loss, extend our 
thoughts to his family and many friends. 
This should be the year that we finish the 
pioneering work of his career. It would be a fit-
ting capstone to a lifetime of cannabis leader-
ship, activism, and progress. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I would 
say that if we are going to have legal-
ization of cannabis, let’s have legaliza-
tion of cannabis and do it in regular 
order in the House of Representatives, 
not have it come through the Financial 
Services Committee. I wanted to be 
clear, and I wanted to make sure my 
colleague heard that. 
But I do commend my colleague, Mr. 
PERLMUTTER, for taking every bit of 
the jurisdiction that we currently have 
and using it smartly for the best out-
come possible. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), my colleague 
and good friend. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in favor of H.R. 1996, the SAFE 
Banking Act of 2021, and I am proud to 
help lead this commonsense, overdue 
effort. 
The vast majority of States, includ-
ing my own, have enacted laws that, to 
varying degrees, permit their residents 
to use cannabis. However, the Federal 
Government has not only infringed on 
the inherent right of these States to 
implement those laws, but also stifled 
medical research, diverted law enforce-
ment resources needed elsewhere, and 
hindered legitimate businesses, busi-
nesses that provide vital services to 
cancer patients, veterans, and those 
seeking opioid alternatives for pain 
management. 
Because of the Federal interference 
in this arena, cannabis companies are 
not afforded the same access to finan-
cial services as every other legal busi-
ness in our country. 
With banks refusing to accept their 
money out of fear of Federal repercus-
sions, these businesses are forced to op-
erate in all cash. They pay their work-
ers in cash, store cash in vaults on-site, 
and hire armored cars and trucks to 
transport cash to pay taxes. 
As a former prosecutor, I can tell my 
colleagues that this is a serious public 
safety issue. 
But it is not just cannabis companies 
that are paying the price for this anti-
quated policy. Small businesses that 
provide services to State-legal can-
nabis companies can also be targeted 
by the Federal Government, such as 
plumbers, electricians, and even soil 
and fertilizer businesses. 
Regardless of where you stand on the 
legality of cannabis, I think we can all 
agree that it shouldn’t be that hard to 
sell a bag of dirt. 
At a time when small businesses are 
just beginning to recover from the eco-
nomic destruction caused by COVID–19, 
the Federal Government should be sup-
porting them, not standing in their 
way. Congress must provide financial 
certainty to these businesses and safe-
ty to their employees. 
Many of my colleagues have shied 
away from this issue because they are 
under the impression that it doesn’t 
impact their constituents. But as I 
have outlined here today, it most cer-
tainly does. 
The American people across the ma-
jority of States, both red and blue, 
have voted to enact sensible cannabis 
reforms. I encourage all of my col-
leagues to respect the will of their con-
stituents and the rights of their States 
and begin engaging in these reforms. 
It is past time we address the anti-
quated cannabis policies and remove 
unnecessary red tape. I strongly urge

my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to vote in favor of the SAFE Banking 
Act so we can take a step in that direc-
tion. 
The Federal Government can no 
longer afford to fail on an issue that 
our States have taken the lead on. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 5 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
ranking member of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee for yielding. 
I rise in support of the SAFE Bank-
ing Act, which I am honored to intro-
duce with my colleagues, Mr. JOYCE, 
Mr. PERLMUTTER, Mr. BLUMENAUER, 
and others. 
It seems the war on drugs is a lot 
like so many of the other forever wars 
that this Congress confronts, deeply 
unpopular in all parts of the country 
except Washington, D.C. 
I commend the majority party for 
bringing this bill to the floor and al-
lowing businesses that serve particu-
larly medical marijuana patients the 
opportunity to access the U.S. finan-
cial system. 
There is an important part of this 
legislation that bears note. With the 
SAFE Banking Act, we will have an 
unprecedented opportunity for research 
and collaboration, which did not exist 
previously and which doesn’t exist 
now. 
There are so many universities, med-
ical centers, other research institu-
tions that would like to partner with 
and work alongside marijuana busi-
nesses with the opportunity to improve 
health outcomes for patients and to 
bring relief to people who badly need 
it. 
I would implore my colleagues in the 
majority party to reach out to Presi-
dent Biden as I did to President Trump. 
Ask him to take executive action to re-
move marijuana from the list of sched-
ule I drugs so that we can accelerate 
marijuana reform for the benefit of our 
fellow Americans and those who are in 
need and in pain and are counting on 
it. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD these endorse-
ments for the SAFE Banking Act, in-
cluding from the American Bankers 
Association, the American Council of 
Independent Laboratories, the Amer-
ican Council of Life Insurers, the

tion, the American Property Casualty 
Insurance Association, the American 
Trade Association for Cannabis and 
Hemp, the Arizona Dispensaries Asso-
ciation, the California Cannabis Indus-
try Association, and the National Ar-
mored Car Association. It goes on for-
ever. I am not going to list all of these. 
There are about 50 different endorse-
ments.

banking associations. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to repeat this from my earlier 
remarks. This bill represents one of the 
biggest changes to U.S. drug policy. If 
we want banks to provide services risk- 
free, then we should do it thoughtfully 
and address the legality of cannabis in-
stead of this workaround. This bill rep-
resents a yeoman’s task of a legal 
framework so that funds from cannabis 
in those legalized States can be legally 
banked. 
But that is not a holistic approach to 
this issue, nor should it be the Finan-
cial Services Committee leading the 
debate, which we have had one hearing 
on in the last 3 years in this com-
mittee—actually, you could say prob-
ably one hearing in the last decade on 
the 
Financial 
Services 
Committee. 
Yet, we have this bill, which, frankly, 
on its face is a very well-balanced bill 
to fix a glaring problem that is hap-
pening across the country. 
This bill will legalize the banking of 
a federally illegal product. I am sure 
the irony of this is not at all lost on 
the American public. 
The drug cartels, frankly, are keen to 
this, and other bad actors are keen to 
this. They will attempt to take advan-
tage of this if it is not well-imple-
mented, if it is not thoughtfully imple-
mented, especially if those things are 
not the case. 
No matter how we spin what is hap-
pening right now, we currently have a 
crisis at the southern border, and 
human trafficking is certainly a part of 
that; a desire to come to the United 
States is certainly a part of that; and 
the movement of illegal drugs into the 
United States is certainly a part of 
that. This doesn’t help with that crisis 
at the southern border. 
Again, we are the House Financial 
Services Committee. We are not the 
Homeland Security Committee, and we 
are not the Appropriations Committee, 
so we can’t fix all things within our ju-
risdiction. 
Let me close with this. I do not sup-
port this bill because it represents a 
workaround to a much bigger debate 
that we need to have in the United 
States, and that is whether or not can-
nabis should remain a schedule I sub-
stance under the Controlled Substances 
Act. This fact is the bigger issue that I 
think this Congress should wrestle 
with, and I would welcome it. In fact, I 
think we can have a much more 
nuanced debate here. 
But I do want to close by thanking 
my colleagues for creating a very 
thoughtful product. This legislative 
text is much improved upon from 
where it was originally. I thank my 
colleague, Mr. PERLMUTTER, for leading 
that conversation and leading that set 
of negotiations. 
It has taken years to produce this 
product. It is strong legislative text. It 
is a strong legal framework. Even 
though I have pointed out a number of 
its deficiencies and challenges, I do see 
on its face how this would resolve a 
huge problem in a large number of 
States. 
I understand that, and I am inviting 
the larger discussion about cannabis, 
as well. I think we need to have that 
conversation. 
But I do thank my colleague, Mr. 
PERLMUTTER, for his leadership there, 
and I thank my colleagues, Mr. STIV-
ERS, Mr. DAVIDSON, and Mr. JOYCE, on 
our side of the aisle for engaging in 
that, as well as Mr. LUETKEMEYER and 
Mr. BARR who dealt with particular 
issues in their States and their juris-
dictions, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ but I understand if they do 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina. To his point that there is a broad-
er discussion that has to take place, 
the purpose of this bill is a public safe-
ty purpose. Its purpose is to keep peo-
ple from being killed, from being 
robbed, and from being assaulted. That 
is within the Financial Services Com-
mittee arena because, at this point, the 
cannabis industry and the people who 
serve it in one way or another have to 
deal in cash, which really creates the

potential for the robberies, for the 
murders, and for the assaults. 
We have been able to gather a lot of 
support for this. I mentioned the bank-
ers, the credit unions, the insurance in-
dustry, the cannabis industry, obvi-
ously, the real estate industry, the ar-
mored cars, and the minority cannabis 
industry. Law enforcement is sup-
portive of this. We have the National 
Treasurers Association, 21 Governors, 
and attorneys general because they 
know this is a public safety matter and 
that we really need to address it. 
We have been working on it for some 
time, as the gentleman from North 
Carolina mentioned, but we need to get 
this to the Senate. They need to take 
whatever action they want to take, but 
we have to make our communities and 
these businesses safer. 
The SAFE Banking Act is about pub-
lic safety. Our bill is narrowly tailored 
to get cash off the streets and improve 
public safety. 
I thank my lead cosponsors on this 
bill, Representatives VELA´ ZQUEZ, STIV-
ERS, and DAVIDSON, and all of my col-
leagues who have listened to me talk 
about the need to address this problem 
for the last 8 years.

I also thank the staff of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services, the staff 
from my lead cosponsors, and my own 
staff, who put so much time into this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the SAFE 
Banking Act, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
PERLMUTTER) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1996, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1602, the Eliminate Barriers to Innova-
tion Act of 2021. 
Digital assets are a fast-growing but 
poorly understood area of finance and 
technology, and I believe this bipar-
tisan legislation will help Americans, 
small businesses, fintechs, and finan-
cial institutions using digital assets to 
better understand the legal and regu-
latory landscape. 
Last Congress, the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services established the Task 
Force on Financial Technology, which 
was chaired by Congressman LYNCH, 
who is co-leading this bipartisan bill 
with Ranking Member MCHENRY. I 
thank both of them for their hard work 
on this legislation. 
We must look carefully and dili-
gently at how digital asset markets are 
used, as they present unique challenges 
to regular retail investors. 
Cryptocurrencies, 
security 
tokens, 
and other digital assets, including 
those utilizing blockchain and distrib-
uted ledger technology, are new tech-
nologies. How we regulate investment 
in them will be one of the most impor-
tant questions in the financial services 
space. 
If digital assets are used by retail in-
vestors, we must ensure these products 
provide adequate protections, disclo-
sures, and notifications to make sure 
ordinary investors are not defrauded or 
have their household finances ruined 
due to excessive volatility. 
This is especially important during 
this unprecedented COVID–19 crisis, 
with many people struggling finan-
cially and possibly drawn to risky in-
vestments or scams. 
This bill would require the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commis-
sion to establish a working group on 
digital assets. The working group will 
investigate the legal and regulatory 
framework and best practices related 
to digital assets. The working group 
will report to Congress on its findings 
to help this body and the public better 
address these evolving markets. 
I thank Representative LYNCH and 
Representative 
MCHENRY
for 
their 
thoughtful and bipartisan approach to 
this legislation, and I look forward to 
the work of the SEC and the CFTC on 
this important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
bill, the Eliminate Barriers to Innova-
tion Act. This a bipartisan bill that ad-
dresses the much-needed collaboration 
between the Commodity Futures Trad-
ing Commission and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
What we have is a regulation of com-
modities through one entity of our 
Federal Government here in the United 
States and regulation of securities by 
another entity of our government. 
What we need is conversation between 
those two entities about the nature of 
digital assets and cryptocurrencies. 
We have neither a security nor a 
commodity in what is a new creation of 
digital assets. Now what we see with 
the CFTC is that everything is a com-
modity in their worldview, and the Se-
curities Exchange Commission thinks: 
Well, you are close. Everything is actu-
ally a security. 
They each want to regulate some-
thing that is not in their nature to reg-
ulate or not in the substance of their 
capacity to regulate. We have neither 
fish nor fowl, neither security nor what 
the Commodity Futures Trading Com-
mission wants to regulate in their 
world. So, you have neither fish nor 
fowl when it comes to this new cre-
ation of cryptocurrencies. 
The 
fact 
is 
that 
the 
‘‘Bitcoin 
Whitepaper,’’ 
written 
by 
Satoshi 
Nakamoto, as they call themselves, is 
more than a decade old. What we have 
seen in that time period is the valu-
ation of bitcoin, and then things that 
are like bitcoin that use an encrypted 
ledger system in the blockchain and 
tokenization to open up the value of 
that new creation of a blockchain, that 
new creation of cryptocurrencies is 
now valued over $2 trillion globally. 
Most of that innovation has hap-
pened outside of the United States be-
cause we don’t have a legal and regu-
latory framework that is permissive of 
the raising of capital in order to de-
velop those technologies. So, people in 
the United States, American citizens, 
are missing out on innovation and the 
potential economic upside of those in-
novations. 
I would say this is one of the few 
pieces of technology in the last 100 
years that Americans have not been 
the drivers of. In fact, we are reacting 
a lot to what is happening globally. 
I thank my colleague, Mr. LYNCH, for 
his thoughtful engagement on this bill 
and his important structural changes 
to make sure this can be a bipartisan 
bill. Those conversations really are 
that balance between economic oppor-
tunity and growth that a lot of us on 
the Republican side want to emphasize 
at all costs, frankly, and then the pro-
tection of our citizens that some on the 
left want to have at all costs. 
Mr. Speaker, striking that balance is 
really necessary for us as legislators. 
Let’s just be pragmatic and honest 
about it. Mr. LYNCH has brought some 
nice changes to this bill that actually 
will enable it to be a bipartisan vote, I 
hope. 
Mr. Speaker, what this bill does, with 
our colleagues from the House Com-
mittee on Agriculture, is it requires 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion and the Commodity Futures Trad-
ing Commission to establish a working 
group focused on digital assets. This is 
the first step to opening the dialogue 
between our regulators and market 
participants and will move to much- 
needed clarity. 
The fact is that this working group 
will produce a report within a year 
that includes an analysis of the domes-
tic regulatory framework necessary for 
the development of cryptocurrencies 
and digital assets here in the United 
States. It is really important that we 
get our act together, that we be tech-
nology-permissive, that we ensure that 
it is legitimate money raised here, that 
our existing laws are adhered to, but 
that we adapt and change and don’t 
allow the debate between the CFTC, 
which sees everything as fish, and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
which sees everything as fowl. 
When we look at this new entity, 
which is neither fish nor fowl, we have 
to have a small regulatory framework 
for that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH). 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Colorado for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of the Eliminate Barriers to Inno-
vation Act. It has been 12 years since 
the cryptocurrency bitcoin was first in-
troduced. Since then, digital assets 
have proliferated around the world. By 
one estimate, there are more than 4,000 
cryptocurrencies and other digital to-
kens in use today. 
While we haven’t yet encountered a 
large-scale crisis, the lack of clarity in 
cryptocurrency regulation has become 
a real barrier in developing a frame-
work to optimize the potential benefits 
of this technology. 
U.S. financial regulations histori-
cally have been developed in response 
to financial disasters. We had the cre-
ation of the FDIC, which followed over 
1,000 bank failures during the Depres-
sion. Similarly, the development of the 
CFPB occurred after the 2008 financial 
crisis. 
This bill, H.R. 1602, is an opportunity 
for Congress and our regulators to act 
proactively toward financial innova-
tion rather than to address gaps in our 
regulatory framework after the fact. 
Digital assets have the potential to 
make transactions more efficient, im-
prove the raising of capital for small 
businesses, 
and 
increase 
inclusion 
across our financial system. However, 
the rapid rise of this technology has

created some concerns and questions 
about consumer protection and about 
how to ensure that we gain the benefits 
of this innovation while mitigating po-
tential risks. 
This bill, H.R. 1602, will create crit-
ical collaboration between the SEC, 
the CFTC, and Congress on the topic of 
digital assets. It will bring our regu-
lators, small businesses, fintech com-
panies, and investor protection groups 
to the same table to discuss cybersecu-
rity investor protections and the cre-
ation of inclusive and transparent mar-
kets. In short, our hope is that this bill 
will help get the regulatory framework 
of digital assets right before a crisis oc-
curs. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member, Mr. MCHENRY, for working on 
this bill and also Chairwoman WATERS 
for her support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
know the gentleman will forgive me, 
but I listed a lot of people on the SAFE 
Banking Act that I want to thank. One 
person who I forgot, and I would be re-
miss, is Mr. Denny Heck, who is now 
Lieutenant Governor of Washington 
and who was also instrumental in put-
ting that together. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I con-
cur that our colleague, Mr. Heck, was 
instrumental in these debates. I miss 
his lively debates in committee mark-
up, but, frankly, given the sick burns 
he has given me there, I think I am 
better off with him as Lieutenant Gov-
ernor. But I concur with the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER). 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Agriculture. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express 
my support of the Eliminate Barriers 
to Innovation Act offered by my friend 
from North Carolina and the ranking 
member of the Committee on Financial 
Services, Mr. MCHENRY. 
The CFTC and the SEC have a long 
history of collaboration in financial 
market regulation. The working group 
created through this legislation will 
continue to build on this good work. 
Digital assets present unique new 
questions for regulators: How and 
where do these assets fit into the exist-
ing 
regulatory 
regime? 
What 
new 
standards are needed to continue to 
meet our bedrock principle of customer 
protection? Where do the CFTC and the 
SEC need to adjust their regulations to 
address the novel features and purposes 
of digital assets? 
While both the CFTC and the SEC 
are hard at work applying their statu-
tory responsibilities and regulations to 
these digital assets, the disruptive, 
novel nature of these new type of as-
sets demand a more holistic examina-
tion. This working group, with its mix 
of CFTC, SEC, and nongovernmental 
members, will be well placed to exam-
ine these important questions. 
The Eliminate Barriers to Innovation 
Act is a step forward in providing clear 
rules of the road for the creation, ex-
change, custody, and use of the full 
sweep of these new assets. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member, Mr. MCHENRY, and his staff 
for working with us at the House Com-
mittee on Agriculture on refinements 
to improve this legislation. 
I cannot close, though, without sing-
ing the praises of the CFTC. The Com-
mission has been focused on this explo-
sion in new technology from the very 
beginning. The Commission created 
LabCFTC almost 4 years ago, and it re-
mains the premier Federal fintech of-
fice. 
They have proven themselves to be 
an agile regulator and adept at under-
standing new technologies and their 
implications. The Committee on Agri-
culture has welcomed these develop-
ments and sought to strengthen the 
CFTC’s authorities and resources to 
meet the challenges in regulating these 
new financial products. The bill before 
us today complements these efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-
ing with Mr. MCHENRY
and Chair-
woman WATERS on this and other legis-
lation and oversight to build upon this 
work. I urge my colleagues to support 
financial innovation and vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this important legislation. 
b 1715 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH), a member of 
the House Agriculture Committee and 
a leader on agriculture issues. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from North Caro-
lina for yielding to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation 
Act. As the ranking member of the 
Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and 
Credit Subcommittee, I am looking 
forward to digging in on the many 
issues surrounding digital assets, par-
ticularly digital commodities. 
Digitally native assets represent a 
new way for people to interact with 
each other and potentially organize 
productive activities. Whatever prom-
ise this innovative technology may 
hold, it will not be realized if it is sub-
jected to outdated and unworkable reg-
ulations. 
One of the great strengths our finan-
cial system in the U.S. has is that the 
rules are well-formed, longstanding, 
and fit for purpose. While we may 
argue about the details, the basic prin-
ciples of the U.S. financial markets, 
and the rules which apply to legacy as-
sets, are well understood. 
Digital assets, on the other hand, 
present new challenges. While the prin-
ciples won’t change, the rules that 
bring those principles into effect may 
have to change. 
This working group will give the 
CFTC, the SEC, and the market par-
ticipants a critical venue to examine 
those principles and bring needed clar-
ity to the application of existing rules 
on digital asset transactions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Mr. LYNCH, for his leadership on this 
important issue and the issues of finan-
cial technology. 
Frankly, one of the healthier con-
versations we get to have on the Finan-
cial Services Committee is on the na-
ture and the deployment of the tech-
nology. It is neither the pure conversa-
tion of less or more regulation. It is a 
completely different scope of what we 
are doing in terms of laws that ensure 
that we have financial inclusion and 
allow offers for products to be cheaper, 
more affordable, and more widely dis-
tributed across the country. So I think 
this is a healthy thing for us to have 
this conversation on the Financial 
Services Committee. 
This bill today is an important work-
ing group between the CFTC and the 
Security and Exchange Commission. 
That conversation between these two 
agencies, I hope, will bring us a new 
permissive regulatory framework for 
digital assets here in the United States 
and allow for the wider deployment and 
development of cryptocurrencies and 
all the technologies that are under-
lying those cryptocurrencies, those 
huge opportunity sets for American 
consumers in the development of these 
new assets in this first generation, but 
also the wire deployment of these tech-
nologies, whether it is in driverless ve-
hicles or in the nature of how we inter-
act with each other in the financial 
markets. 
There are huge opportunities around 
digital assets, and this is the first step 
in Congress having a smart regulatory 
framework here in the United States 
for digital assets. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
commend 
Mr. 
MCHENRY and Mr. LYNCH for their bi-
partisan work on this legislation di-
recting the SEC and the CFTC to work 
together with all relevant stakeholders 
to study the use of digital assets. 
The working group created by this 
legislation will, undoubtedly, benefit 
the American public on this important 
topic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support 
this 
legislation 
by 
voting 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

CONDEMNING CONTINUED VIOLA-
TION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS 
OF PEOPLE OF HONG KONG BY 
PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
AND 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
HONG 
KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE 
REGION 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 130) condemning the 
continued violation of rights and free-
doms of the people of Hong Kong by the 
People’s Republic of China and the 
Government of the Hong Kong special 
administrative region. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 130 
Whereas despite international condemna-
tion, the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China (‘‘PRC’’) continues to disregard 
its international legal obligations under the 
Joint Declaration of the Government of the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and North-
ern Ireland and the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China on the Question of 
Hong Kong (‘‘Joint Declaration’’), in which 
the PRC committed that— 
(1) Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy; 
(2) for at least 50 years the ‘‘social and eco-
nomic systems in Hong Kong’’ would remain 
unchanged; and 
(3) the personal rights and freedoms of the 
people of Hong Kong would be protected by 
law; 
Whereas, as part of its continued efforts to 
undermine the established rights of the Hong 
Kong people, the PRC National People’s Con-
gress Standing Committee (‘‘Standing Com-
mittee’’) passed and imposed upon Hong 
Kong oppressive and intentionally vague na-
tional security legislation on June 30, 2020, 
that grants Beijing sweeping powers to pun-
ish acts of ‘‘separating the country, sub-
verting state power, and organizing terror-
istic activities’’; 
Whereas the legislative process by which 
the Standing Committee imposed the na-
tional security law on Hong Kong bypassed 
Hong Kong’s local government in a potential 
violation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China (‘‘Basic Law’’), and 
involved unusual secrecy, as demonstrated 
by the fact that the legislation was only the 
second law since 2008 that the Standing Com-
mittee has passed without releasing a draft 
for public comment; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2020, election officials 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion (HKSAR) disqualified twelve pro-democ-
racy candidates from participating in the 
September 6 Legislative Council elections, 
which were subsequently postponed for a 
year until September 5, 2021, by citing the 
public health risk of holding elections during 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, on July 31, 2020, in an attempt to 
assert 
extraterritorial 
jurisdiction, 
the 
HKSAR Government announced indictments 
of and arrest warrants for six Hong Kong ac-
tivists living overseas, including United 
States citizen Samuel Chu, for alleged viola-
tions of the national security law; 
Whereas, on November 11, 2020, the HKSAR 
Government removed four lawmakers from 
office for allegedly violating the law after 
the Standing Committee passed additional 
legislation barring those who promoted or 
supported Hong Kong independence and re-
fused to acknowledge PRC sovereignty over 
Hong Kong, or otherwise violates the na-
tional security law, from running for or serv-
ing in the Legislative Council; 
Whereas, on December 2, 2020, pro-democ-
racy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, 
and Ivan Lam were sentenced to prison for 
participating in 2019 protests; 
Whereas ten of the twelve Hong Kong resi-
dents (also known as ‘‘the Hong Kong 12’’) 
who sought to flee by boat from Hong Kong 
to Taiwan on August 23, 2020, were taken to 
mainland China and sentenced on December 
30, 2020, to prison terms ranging from seven 
months to three years for illegal border 
crossing; 
Whereas, on December 31, 2020, Hong 
Kong’s highest court revoked bail for Jimmy 
Lai Chee-Ying, a pro-democracy figure and 
publisher, who was charged on December 12 
with colluding with foreign forces and endan-
gering national security under the national 
security legislation; 
Whereas, on January 4, 2021, the Depart-
ments of Justice in Henan and Sichuan prov-
ince threatened to revoke the licenses of two 
lawyers hired to help the Hong Kong 12; and 
Whereas, on January 5, 2021, the Hong 
Kong Police Force arrested more than fifty 
opposition figures, including pro-democracy 
officials, activists, and an American lawyer, 
for their involvement in an informal July 
2020 primary to select candidates for the gen-
eral election originally scheduled for Sep-
tember 2020, despite other political parties 
having held similar primaries without ret-
ribution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the actions taken by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
(‘‘PRC’’) and the Government of the Hong 
Kong 
Special 
Administrative 
Region 
(‘‘HKSAR’’), including the adoption and im-
plementation of national security legislation 
for Hong Kong through irregular procedures, 
that violate the rights and freedoms of the 
people of Hong Kong that are guaranteed by 
the Joint Declaration and its implementing 
document, the Basic Law; 
(2) reaffirms its support for the people of 
Hong Kong, who face grave threats to their 
rights and freedoms; 
(3) calls on the governments of the PRC 
and HKSAR to— 
(A) respect and uphold— 
(i) commitments made to the international 
community and the people of Hong Kong 
under the Joint Declaration; and 
(ii) the judicial independence of the Hong 
Kong legal system; and 
(B) release pro-democracy activists and 
politicians arrested under the national secu-
rity law; and 
(4) encourages the President, the Secretary 
of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury 
to coordinate with allies and partners and 
continue United States efforts to respond to 
developments in Hong Kong, including by— 
(A) providing protection for Hong Kong 
residents who fear persecution; 
(B) supporting those who may seek to file 
a case before the International Court of Jus-
tice to hold the Government of the PRC ac-
countable for violating its binding legal 
commitments under the Joint Declaration; 
(C) encouraging allies and partner coun-
tries to instruct, as appropriate, their re-
spective representatives to the United Na-
tions to use their voice, vote, and influence 
to press for the appointment of a United Na-
tions special mandate holder to monitor and 
report on human rights developments in 
Hong Kong; 
(D) ensuring the private sector, particu-
larly United States companies with eco-
nomic interests in Hong Kong, is aware of 
risks the national security legislation poses 
to the security of United States citizens and 
to the medium and long-term interest of 
United States businesses in Hong Kong; 
(E) continuing to implement sanctions au-
thorities, especially authorities recently en-
acted to address actions undermining the 
rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people 
such as the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (Pub-
lic Law 116–149) and the Hong Kong Human 
Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (Public 
Law 116–76), with respect to officials of the 
Chinese Communist Party, the Government 
of the PRC, or the Government of the 
HKSAR who are responsible for undermining 
such rights and freedoms; and 
(F) coordinating with allies and partners 
to ensure that such implementation of sanc-
tions is multilateral. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
130. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 130, Condemning Continued 
Violation of Rights and Freedoms of 
the People of Hong Kong by People’s 
Republic of China and Government of 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion. 
I have introduced this resolution to 
demonstrate 
this 
body’s 
already 
strong, bipartisan support for the peo-
ple of Hong Kong. 
The situation in Hong Kong has been 
alarming for several years now. We 
have witnessed the degradation of civil 
liberties and human rights as the PRC 
continues to disregard its international 
legal obligations under the 1984 Sino- 
British Joint Declaration. 
For months, in 2019, the people of 
Hong Kong peacefully took to the 
streets in historic numbers to preserve 
their democracy and demand their 
rights and freedoms. Unfortunately,

these peaceful protesters were met 
with excessive force by the police and 
the further imposition of restrictions 
on expression and assembly. Thousands 
have been beaten, injured, and illegally 
detained in violation of due process. 
Rather than listen to the demands of 
the majority of Hong Kongers, the Chi-
nese Government blatantly bypassed 
Hong Kong’s local government and im-
posed a sweeping national security law 
on Hong Kong and its people with very 
little accountability or transparency. 
The vague, overly broad measures this 
security law put in place are little 
more than a thinly veiled attempt to 
erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and re-
strict the space for peaceful expression. 
It steals from the people of Hong Kong 
the ability to exercise the freedoms of 
speech and association and creates an 
environment of fear around the expres-
sion of any political sentiment. 
It is no surprise that since the pas-
sage of this law, political censorship 
has spiked significantly and Hong Kong 
officials have become increasingly bra-
zen in undermining democratic norms, 
such as disqualifying pro-democracy 
candidates from participating in the 
legislative council elections and re-
moving democratically elected law-
makers from office. 
Hong Kong authorities have also used 
the national security law to target and 
silence 
pro-democracy 
activists 
at 
home and abroad. They have even 
issued arrest warrants for activists liv-
ing overseas, including a U.S. citizen, 
for alleged violations of national secu-
rity law. 
Hundreds of pro-democracy figures 
and activists have been arrested or sen-
tenced to prison, including Joshua 
Wong, Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam, the 
‘‘Hong Kong 12,’’ and Jimmy Lai Chee- 
Ying, while others await a further 
crackdown. But the resolve of the peo-
ple of Hong Kong has not wavered, and 
neither will the resolve of the people of 
the United States, our allies, and this 
body. 
Mr. Speaker, see, democracy is the 
cornerstone of the work we do in the 
people’s House. We must support the 
people of Hong Kong as they fight for 
the rights and freedoms promised to 
them under the Basic Law. With the 
passage of this resolution, the House 
reaffirms its continued support for the 
people of Hong Kong. 
We stand by activists who continue 
to come forward in their cause for de-
mocracy and human rights at great 
risk to themselves, their families, and 
their future. But by passing this reso-
lution, the House sends a strong, bipar-
tisan message demanding that the Chi-
nese and Hong Kong Governments re-
spect the will of the people of Hong 
Kong. 
We will continue to push for democ-
racy and respect for human rights in 
Hong Kong. We will continue to dem-
onstrate that we stand in solidarity 
with the pro-democracy figures and ac-
tivists who have made tremendous sac-
rifices for their city and for their core 
human rights. 
This is an important resolution, and 
I support it and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the very distin-
guished Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
b 1730 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
very moving and profound statement 
on democracy and democratic freedoms 
in Hong Kong. I thank the chairman 
for his leadership for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor. I thank 
the ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL, for 
his leadership, as well, on an ongoing 
basis on this important issue and for 
his courtesy for yielding back. 
It is always an honor to be with 
CHRIS SMITH, we have been working on 
these issues together for 30 years—a 
very long time—to demonstrate the bi-
partisan nature of the support that we 
have for democratic freedoms in Hong 
Kong, in the House, and in the Senate, 
bicameral and bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, Friday was a sad day 
and a disturbing day for the people of 
Hong Kong and for all freedom-loving 
people as sentences were handed down 
to Martin Lee, a global champion of 
human rights, and to other pro-democ-
racy leaders for engaging in peaceful 
protests. 
This afternoon, 3 days after that dis-
tressing development, I had the privi-
lege to speak with activists from the 
Hong Kong Democracy Council. It was 
an inspiration to hear how they and 
the people of Hong Kong are responding 
to China’s crackdown with great cour-
age; how the dream of real autonomy 
cannot be extinguished by injustice or 
intimidation. 
In our conversation earlier today— 
and in all my communications with 
Hong Kongers—they asked that the 
United States Congress continue to 
speak out to support their aspirations 
for the freedoms that they were prom-
ised. We were there when they prom-
ised them. 
Today, with this resolution, Congress 
is honoring that call. I thank Chair-
man MEEKS, Ranking Member MCCAUL, 
again, 
Representatives 
BERA
and 
MALINOWSKI, 
and 
the 
distinguished 
chair of the China Executive Commis-
sion, Mr. MCGOVERN, for their work on 
this important legislation. 
H. Res. 130 condemns the continued 
violation of rights and freedoms of the 
people of Hong Kong by the People’s 
Republic of China and the Government 
of the Hong Kong Special Administra-
tive Region. 
It states that Communist China con-
tinues to ‘‘disregard its international 
legal obligations under the joint dec-
laration’’ 
which 
mandates, 
among 
other pledges, that ‘‘Hong Kong would 
enjoy a high degree of autonomy’’ and 
‘‘the personal rights and freedoms of 
the people of Hong Kong would be pro-
tected by law.’’ 
This resolution today makes clear 
that China has trampled on its prom-
ises, including its draconian so-called 
national security law used to target 
and round up peaceful protesters under 
the guise of terrorism; disqualification 
of pro-democracy candidates from par-
ticipating in the September 6 legisla-
tive council elections; the indictments 
and arrests for six Hong Kong activists 
living overseas—as the distinguished 
chairman pointed out, including here 
in the United States—and the arrests 
and sentencing of dozens of pro-democ-
racy activists, including, as was men-
tioned, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and 
Ivan Lam—and opposition leaders, the 
Hong Kong 12, of this past December 
and January. Again, I mention Martin 
Lee. 
The United States Congress has al-
ways supported Hong Kong on a bipar-
tisan and bicameral basis, and we re-
main laser-focused on efforts to sup-
port Hong Kong’s efforts to maintain 
and grow the rule of law and freedom of 
speech in their home, and we are deter-
mined to hold China accountable. 
Our response must include further 
strengthening our work with inter-
national coalitions—this has to be mul-
tilateral—passing legislation in addi-
tion to this resolution, to support Hong 
Kong, building on the passage of the 
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act in 2019. 
Our legislative response must also 
address the plight of the Uighurs and 
Tibetans and the violation of their 
rights in China; and we must continue 
to use our platform to speak out about 
Beijing’s crackdown on the global 
stage and ensure that the voices that 
the Chinese Government are trying to 
silence are heard. 
In response, our focus must be on 
human rights. As I always say, if we do 
not speak out for human rights in 
China because of commercial interests, 
then we lose all moral authority to 
speak out on human rights anywhere in 
the world. 
That is what I have been stating and 
fighting for—as we have together— 
since 1991 when I went to Tiananmen 
Square and unfurled a black-and-white 
banner reading: To those who died for 
democracy. 
Ever since, many of us have fought to 
ensure that human rights and trade are 
firmly linked, from sponsoring the 
U.S.-China Act in 1993 and in 1994 urg-
ing Congress to deny China most-fa-
vored nation status to goods made by 
the PLA in the prisons. 
Mr. SMITH and Mr. Frank Wolf went 
there and saw the evidence of prison 
labor goods being sent to the U.S. and 
corporate America just ignoring the 
whole thing. 
Then in 2000 we fought efforts to give 
China a blank check when it failed to 
comply with its market commitment 
under the WTO, and they still continue 
to do that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1929 
April 19, 2021 
We cannot allow economic interests 
to blind us to moral injustices com-
mitted by China. 
On Friday in a speech to court, the 
storied Hong Kong attorney, Margaret 
Ng, quoted Sir Thomas More, the pa-
tron saint of the legal profession, who 
was tried for treason because he would 
not bend the law to the king’s will. 
Margaret Ng ended her statement by 
paraphrasing his final, famous words: 
I stand the law’s good servant, but the peo-
ple’s first. For the law must serve the people, 
not the people the law. 
With that, I support an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan vote for this resolu-
tion and for the Congress’ continued bi-
partisan and bicameral work to sup-
port the people of Hong Kong in the 
face of Beijing’s exploitation of and as-
sault on the law. It is a very important 
piece of legislation, and I am so glad it 
is going to have bipartisan support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote, 
and I thank the chair and the ranking 
member of the committee for their 
leadership. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
First of all, let me thank the Speaker 
for coming down on the floor to give 
her personal remarks. I know she has a 
busy schedule, but this really honors 
and shows her commitment to human 
rights in Hong Kong and all around the 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join the 
chairman in leading this measure to 
condemn the egregious violations of 
Hong Kong’s freedoms. The Chinese 
Communist Party’s relentless oppres-
sion of the people of Hong Kong is not 
a Republican or Democratic issue. We 
are united as Americans in standing 
with Hong Kongers. 
Hong Kong’s pro-democracy move-
ment has inspired people around the 
world to fight for liberty over tyranny. 
But in June of last year, the Chinese 
Communist Party used its sham legis-
lature to enforce a dystopian national 
security law on Hong Kong. This law 
criminalizes basic civil liberties, it vio-
lated China’s treaty commitments, it 
destroyed the ‘‘one country, two sys-
tems’’ model of autonomy, and it in-
serted the CCP’s police state into Hong 
Kong to crush dissent. 
Since it passed, the CCP has purged 
pro-democracy lawmakers from the 
government while arresting the CCP’s 
political enemies. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
CCP’s 
human 
rights abuses in Hong Kong are far 
from over. Chairman MEEKS’ resolution 
continues our bipartisan work to call 
out the CCP’s abuses and to stand with 
the people of Hong Kong, and I urge my 
colleagues’ support for this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH), who is the ranking member of 
the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Africa, Global Health, Global Human 
Rights, and International Organiza-
tions and has been a champion for 
human rights more than most people 
have been in this Congress maybe com-
bined. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, the 
ranking member, for his kind remarks. 
I thank him for his leadership on this 
resolution, as well. I thank Chairman 
MEEKS for his leadership on this. It is a 
bipartisan resolution, and it is very 
much needed right now. H. Res. 130 
condemns the ongoing violation of 
human rights and the rule of law in 
Hong Kong perpetrated by the Chinese 
Communist Party under Xi Jinping and 
the Government of Hong Kong itself. 
As the author of the House-passed, 
bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights 
Act signed into law last Congress, 
which I first introduced in 2014 and 
again in 2015, 2017, and then for a final 
time in 2019, I want to just thank 
Speaker PELOSI for putting that legis-
lation before this body and for her 
strong support. 
The Speaker mentioned a moment 
ago how we have worked for well over 
30 years on combating human rights 
abuses in China whether it be Tibet, 
the ongoing repression and now geno-
cide against the Uighurs, and the 
crackdown on religious freedom which 
has now become nothing but pervasive 
persecution against people of all faiths 
as well as the Falun Gong. We have 
worked very, very closely together, and 
I believe going back to right after 
Tiananmen Square, that linkage of 
human rights with trade was the only 
way to effectuate systemic change. Re-
grettably, we have lost so far that link-
age. But, again, now we are seeing 
manifestations, particularly in Hong 
Kong. 
Could Taiwan be next? Consider all of 
the promises that were made—and 
there were solemn promises made by 
the dictatorship in Beijing—to respect 
human rights in Hong Kong. The basic 
law is now being violated with impu-
nity. 
Of course, there is the Sino-U.K. 
agreement that is being violated. This 
is an international treaty, and there is 
the Chinese dictatorship one by one ar-
resting the best, the bravest, and the 
brightest of Hong Kong and putting 
them into prison for long prison sen-
tences. 
As the Speaker noted a moment ago, 
we just saw that Joshua Wong got an 
additional jail sentence on his already 
131⁄2-month jail sentence. We know that 
he is a great young man, and he rep-
resents the future of Hong Kong. He 
now is languishing in prison. 
I met Martin Lee in Hong Kong in 
the early 1990s, and he suggested to me 
that someday he may find himself in 
prison. He said that it is worth it for 
human rights and for democracy. He is 
an absolutely brave and an absolutely 
principled lawyer, a former member of 
the Hong Kong Legislative Council. He 
too has been convicted under this 
crackdown on democracy promotion in 
Hong Kong. 
So there are also many, many others. 
Jimmy Lai was one of five who were 
just sentenced last Friday. So this is 
happening in real time every single 
day. Once you are arrested and put into 
prison, the bully boys of the Hong Kong 
police make sure that you suffer, and 
you suffer intensely. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, 
again, Chairman MEEKS for bringing 
this forward and, of course, my good 
friend, Mr. MCCAUL. 
Mr. MEEKS. I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER), who is a member of 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Res. 130, a reso-
lution condemning the violations of 
the basic rights and freedoms of the 
people of Hong Kong. As part of the 
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on 
Hong Kong, the People’s Republic of 
China made a series of commitments: 
that Hong Kong would retain a high de-
gree of autonomy; that its social and 
economic systems would remain un-
changed until at least 2047; and that 
the personal rights and liberties of the 
people of Hong Kong would be pro-
tected by the law. 
Yet we continue to see the PRC in-
fringe on Hong Kong’s sovereignty and 
its people’s freedoms. It has been made 
abundantly clear that the People’s Re-
public of China has no intention of 
keeping its promises. 
Most 
recently, 
the 
PRC 
forced 
through the draconian but mundane- 
sounding Law of the People’s Republic 
of China on Safeguarding National Se-
curity in the Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region. This law casts an 
authoritarian net over Hong Kong and 
has empowered a crackdown on vague-
ly worded political crimes like subver-
sion and collusion with foreign powers. 
From day one, that law has been 
abused, with the people of Hong Kong 
arrested for such crimes as wearing 
stickers or T-shirts with disagreeable 
slogans. 
The rapid erosion of Hong Kongers’ 
rights and freedoms is absolutely unac-
ceptable, and it is past time that the 
PRC and its puppet government that it 
installed in Hong Kong be condemned 
in the strongest possible terms. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this resolution to 
send a clear message that we in the 
United States will not stand by as the 
rights and freedoms of the people of 
Hong Kong are stripped away. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers if the gentleman from 
Texas is ready to close. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, sadly, we no longer see 
American flags waving over thousands 
of peaceful protesters in the streets of 
Hong Kong. Displaying our symbol of 
liberty has become a criminal act pun-
ishable by life in prison. But even 
though the freedom-loving people of 
Hong Kong can no longer publicly ask 
for our support, we still hear these 
pleas. Congress hears them, the Amer-
ican people hear them, and it is now

more important than ever that we con-
tinue to stand with the people of Hong 
Kong. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man MEEKS for bringing this resolution 
which I was proud to join as a lead co-
sponsor, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
b 1745 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the 
ranking member for making sure we 
make a unified, strong, bipartisan 
statement, and all of my colleagues on 
the Foreign Affairs Committee on both 
sides of the aisle because H. Res. 130 
sends a strong and unequivocal mes-
sage: The United States stands firmly 
in support of the people of Hong Kong 
and the rights, freedoms, and auton-
omy they are promised in the joint dec-
laration and basic law. 
This 
resolution 
signals 
that 
the 
House’s support of the people of Hong 
Kong and their struggle for democracy 
shall not waiver and shall remain firm 
and resolute. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that all of my 
colleagues will join Ranking Member 
MCCAUL and myself in supporting this 
resolution, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 130. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

CYBER DIPLOMACY ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1251) to support United States 
international cyber diplomacy, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1251 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Cyber Diplomacy Act of 2021’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Findings. 
Sec. 3. Definitions. 
Sec. 4. United states international cyber-
space policy. 
Sec. 5. Department of state responsibilities.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The stated goal of the United States 
International 
Strategy 
for 
Cyberspace, 
launched on May 16, 2011, is to ‘‘work inter-
nationally to promote an open, interoper-
able, secure, and reliable information and 
communications infrastructure that sup-
ports international trade and commerce, 
strengthens international security, and fos-
ters free expression and innovation . . . in 
which norms of responsible behavior guide 
states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and 
support the rule of law in cyberspace’’. 
(2) In its June 24, 2013, report, the Group of 
Governmental Experts on Developments in 
the Field of Information and Telecommuni-
cations in the Context of International Secu-
rity (referred to in this section as ‘‘GGE’’), 
established by the United Nations General 
Assembly, 
concluded 
that 
‘‘State 
sov-
ereignty and the international norms and 
principles that flow from it apply to States’ 
conduct of [information and communications 
technology] ICT-related activities and to 
their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure 
with their territory’’. 
(3) In January 2015, China, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbek-
istan proposed a troubling international code 
of conduct for information security, which 
could be used as a pretext for restricting po-
litical dissent, and includes ‘‘curbing the dis-
semination of information that incites ter-
rorism, separatism or extremism or that in-
flames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious 
grounds’’. 
(4) In its July 22, 2015, consensus report, 
GGE found that ‘‘norms of responsible State 
behavior can reduce risks to international 
peace, security and stability’’. 
(5) On September 25, 2015, the United 
States and China announced a commitment 
that neither country’s government ‘‘will 
conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled 
theft of intellectual property, including 
trade secrets or other confidential business 
information, with the intent of providing 
competitive advantages to companies or 
commercial sectors’’. 
(6) At the Antalya Summit on November 15 
and 16, 2015, the Group of 20 Leaders’ 
communique´— 
(A) affirmed the applicability of inter-
national law to state behavior in cyberspace; 
(B) called on states to refrain from cyber- 
enabled theft of intellectual property for 
commercial gain; and 
(C) endorsed the view that all states should 
abide by norms of responsible behavior. 
(7) The March 2016 Department of State 
International Cyberspace Policy Strategy 
noted that ‘‘the Department of State antici-
pates a continued increase and expansion of 
our cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the 
foreseeable future’’. 
(8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on 
Enhancing National Cybersecurity, which 
was established within the Department of 
Commerce by Executive Order 13718 (81 Fed. 
Reg. 7441), recommended that ‘‘the President 
should appoint an Ambassador for Cyberse-
curity to lead U.S. engagement with the 
international community on cybersecurity 
strategies, standards, and practices’’. 
(9) On April 11, 2017, the 2017 Group of 7 
Declaration on Responsible States Behavior 
in Cyberspace— 
(A) recognized ‘‘the urgent necessity of in-
creased international cooperation to pro-
mote security and stability in cyberspace’’; 
(B) expressed commitment to ‘‘promoting 
a strategic framework for conflict preven-
tion, cooperation and stability in cyber-
space, consisting of the recognition of the 
applicability of existing international law to 
State behavior in cyberspace, the promotion 
of voluntary, non-binding norms of respon-
sible State behavior during peacetime, and 
the development and the implementation of 
practical cyber confidence building measures 
(CBMs) between States’’; and 
(C) reaffirmed that ‘‘the same rights that 
people have offline must also be protected 
online’’. 
(10) In testimony before the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the Senate on May 
11, 2017, Director of National Intelligence 
Daniel R. Coats identified six cyber threat 
actors, including— 
(A) Russia, for ‘‘efforts to influence the 
2016 U.S. election’’; 
(B) China, for ‘‘actively targeting the U.S. 
Government, its allies, and U.S. companies 
for cyber espionage’’; 
(C) Iran, for ‘‘leverag[ing] cyber espionage, 
propaganda, and attacks to support its secu-
rity priorities, influence events and foreign 
perceptions, and counter threats’’; 
(D) 
North 
Korea, 
for 
‘‘previously 
conduct[ing] 
cyber-attacks 
against 
U.S. 
commercial entities—specifically, Sony Pic-
tures Entertainment in 2014’’; 
(E) terrorists, who ‘‘use the Internet to or-
ganize, recruit, spread propaganda, raise 
funds, collect intelligence, inspire action by 
followers, and coordinate operations’’; and 
(F) criminals, who ‘‘are also developing 
and using sophisticated cyber tools for a va-
riety of purposes including theft, extortion, 
and facilitation of other criminal activi-
ties’’. 
(11) On May 11, 2017, President Donald J. 
Trump issued Executive Order 13800 (82 Fed. 
Reg. 22391), entitled ‘‘Strengthening the Cy-
bersecurity of Federal Networks and Infra-
structure’’, which— 
(A) designates the Secretary of State to 
lead an interagency effort to develop an en-
gagement strategy for international co-
operation in cybersecurity; and 
(B) notes that ‘‘the United States is espe-
cially dependent on a globally secure and re-
silient internet and must work with allies 
and other partners toward maintaining . . . 
the policy of the executive branch to pro-
mote an open, interoperable, reliable, and se-
cure internet that fosters efficiency, innova-
tion, communication, and economic pros-
perity, while respecting privacy and guard-
ing against disruption, fraud, and theft’’.

Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1251, the Cyber Diplomacy 
Act of 2021, as amended, by my good 
friend and the Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee’s ranking member, Mr. MCCAUL. I 
thank him for his work on this impor-
tant bill. 
This Congress, the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee aims to prioritize ef-
forts to reassert American leadership 
on a variety of issues. I can’t think of 
any issue that is more timely than en-
suring American leadership is prepared 
to confront the growing national secu-
rity challenge in cyberspace. 
The U.S. is increasingly under attack 
online by foreign actors, whether it is 
the recent SolarWinds hack or other 
attempted cyber intrusions on critical 
American infrastructure. 
Now more than ever, we need a senior 
cyber diplomat who can support Amer-
ican efforts to keep the internet open, 
interoperable, reliable, and secure. 
To demonstrate how seriously the 
United States takes these issues, it is 
vital that we strengthen the State De-
partment’s tools to address the chal-
lenges in cyberspace to American for-
eign policy. The State Department 
needs a bureau capable and focused on 
tackling the growing global challenges 
of cybersecurity, the digital economy, 
and internet freedom in order to be

better prepared to advance America’s 
international interests on cyber policy. 
Madam Speaker, that is exactly what 
this Cyber Diplomacy Act will do. Our 
allies and adversaries are prioritizing 
international engagement to set the 
standards and rules that govern how 
the internet is structured and used. 
The United States has always been a 
leader in this space, and now is the 
time to redouble our efforts to ensure 
we remain an influential voice in es-
tablishing the rules of the road. 
It is critical that the United States 
prioritize our diplomatic efforts in this 
area and work with our partners and 
allies to establish agreed-upon norms. 
To keep the internet open and acces-
sible, we must push back against coun-
tries that will exploit the internet to 
pilfer our intellectual property and 
hack into our country’s most sensitive 
information, and which seek to derail 
international norms. 
This bill is critical to supporting 
these key priorities. It authorizes the 
Bureau of International Cyberspace 
Policy to lead the State Department’s 
cyber diplomatic efforts, including on 
issues relating to international cyber-
security, internet access and freedom, 
and international cyber threats, in-
cluding countering terrorists’ use of 
cyberspace. 
This bill also directs the President to 
devise a strategy related to U.S. en-
gagement with foreign governments on 
international norms with respect to re-
sponsible state behavior in cyberspace. 
I am also pleased that in authorizing 
this office, we make clear bipartisan 
congressional intent that the Bureau of 
International 
Cyberspace 
Policy 
is 
comprised of a diverse workforce. Like 
the rest of our national security policy 
establishments, we know that ensuring 
a diverse and inclusive workforce im-
proves the effectiveness of national se-
curity activities, and this bill makes 
that intent very clear. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to sup-
port this critical and, again, bipartisan 
measure that will reassert American 
leadership on this important issue, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased the 
House is considering the Cyber Diplo-
macy Act that I reintroduced this Con-
gress with Chairman MEEKS
and a 
strong roster of bipartisan cosponsors. 
I also want to thank my good friend 
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN), my 
co-chair on the Congressional Cyberse-
curity Caucus. Over the past decade, he 
and I have worked very hard to ad-
vance critical cyber legislation like the 
law that set up the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency at the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
With today’s bill, we are taking the 
protection provided by CISA to the 
United States to the international 
stage and, as the chairman mentioned, 
providing rules of the road, which we 
do not have today. 
The United States has strategic and 
economic interests in ensuring the 
internet remains open, reliable, and se-
cure around the world. Unfortunately, 
not all governments agree. 
For example, Russia and China are 
aggressively promoting their vision of 
‘‘cyber sovereignty,’’ which emphasizes 
state control over cyberspace and 
tramples individual freedoms. That is 
why the United States and our allies 
must be prepared to advance our own 
vision for cyberspace. 
The Cyber Diplomacy Act gives the 
State Department the necessary tools 
to work with our allies and partners to 
stop the spread of misinformation, to 
stop the cyberattacks, and to stop the 
imposition of their so-called cyber se-
curity. 
Madam Speaker, a new ambassador 
will be given the authority to establish 
critical cyber norms and standards 
that do not exist today to help define 
what is good behavior and what is bad. 
Let me say that when the SolarWinds 
attack occurred, in the past, there 
were no consequences to bad behavior 
with the Russians or the Chinese, and I 
was very supportive and proud that 
President Biden struck back with sanc-
tions against Russia for this bad behav-
ior. That is what this office is really all 
about. 
Without these clear guidelines, it is 
not possible to mount a strong re-
sponse to our adversaries’ destructive 
behavior. This bill is long overdue. To 
me, it is the last piece in terms of our 
cyber role in the Federal Government, 
now taking it to the international 
stage with our allies around the world. 
Madam Speaker, again, I want to 
thank Chairman MEEKS, Mr. LANGEVIN, 
and all of the bipartisan cosponsors. 
The recent high-profile attacks remind 
us that what happens in cyberspace is 
vitally important to the United States 
and our allies and partners around the 
world. This act will enhance our ability 
to protect and promote our national se-
curity, our ability to compete, and the 
freedoms 
and 
ideals 
America 
rep-
resents to the world. 
A decade ago, we had to determine 
what is the cyber role—or maybe even 
15—what the role is of the Federal Gov-
ernment. We knew the Department of 
Defense and NSA had great offensive 
capabilities. We needed a civilian agen-
cy to work with the private sector to 
share threat information, and that be-
came the beginning of the cybersecu-
rity agency at the Department of 
Homeland Security. And, of course, the 
FBI investigates. But we have never 
had any international norms or stand-
ards or, as the chairman said, the rules 
of the road. 
This bill, as I said, is long overdue. 
The Russians influenced our elections. 
There are, finally, sanctions against 
them. 
But 
before 
that, 
few 
con-
sequences occurred. When the Chinese 
stole 23 million security clearances, in-
cluding my own, there was zero re-
sponse from the United States of Amer-
ica. 
When these attacks occurred, and 
when our intellectual property has 
been stolen, so much so that Keith 
Alexander, the NSA Director, said it 
was the ‘‘greatest transfer of wealth in 
human history,’’ with no consequence, 
we finally shut down the Chinese con-
sulate in Houston because of the tre-
mendous theft of intellectual property 
through the Texas Medical Center in 
my home State, including research and 
development on the vaccine. Then 
there was a Texas A&M professor being 
indicted for espionage for giving NASA 
data to the Chinese. This has to stop. 
This act, this cyber diplomacy bill, 
will ensure that, at the international 
level, the United States is respected 
and that we are going to work with our 
allies to provide the norms and stand-
ards that are so desperately needed to 
better protect our interests and the in-
terests of our allies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1251, the Cyber 
Diplomacy Act, introduced by my 
friend and the ranking member, Mr. 
MCCAUL, is bipartisan legislation that 
is essential to America’s national secu-
rity and positioning our country to 
meet the current and future threats in 
cyberspace head-on. 
This bill will give the State Depart-
ment the tools it needs to further se-
cure peace, stability, and economic 
prosperity for the United States in the 
cyber realm now and in the future. 
Again, I hope all of my colleagues 
join both Mr. MCCAUL and myself in 
supporting this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

crackdowns on peaceful protesters by 
the illegitimate Lukashenka regime, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 124 
Whereas the Republic of Belarus held a 
presidential election on August 9, 2020, that 
was neither free nor fair; 
Whereas the presidential election took 
place without appropriate observation from 
local independent groups and international 
delegations; 
Whereas since the presidential election, 
Belarusians have demonstrated their strong 
desire and commitment to a democratic fu-
ture by organizing peaceful protests in 
Minsk and across the country; 
Whereas Belarusian civil society, led by 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has called for 
the resignation of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, 
the peaceful transition of power, the organi-
zation of new, free, and fair elections and the 
release of all political prisoners; 
Whereas 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leaders 
have faced intimidation, harassment, and de-
tention, including direct threats leading to 
the 
forced 
exile 
of 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya in Lithuania as well as the 
kidnapping 
and 
imprisonment 
of 
Maria 
Kalesnikava and other opposition leaders; 
Whereas in the months since the election, 
Belarusian authorities have arbitrarily de-
tained and brutally assaulted tens of thou-
sands of peaceful protesters, journalists, and 
opposition figures, of which hundreds remain 
in detention; 
Whereas human rights groups have docu-
mented hundreds of horrific accounts of tor-
ture, including sexual violence and rape, 
along with other instances ill-treatment and 
excessive force used against detainees ar-
rested for peaceful protest; 
Whereas on August 13 and 14, 2020, relatives 
of 
detainees 
held 
in 
the 
infamous 
‘‘Akrestsina’’ detention facility in Minsk re-
corded the sounds of ‘‘incessant beatings 
which were clearly audible in the street, and 
numerous voices screaming out in agony 
with some begging for mercy’’; 
Whereas thousands of Belarusians have 
fled to neighboring countries seeking polit-
ical asylum; 
Whereas independent journalists and the 
free media have faced intimidation, violence, 
mass arrests and prosecution, with many for-
eign journalists being stripped of their ac-
creditation; 
Whereas Katsyaryna Andreyeva and Darya 
Chultsovatwo, two journalists who work for 
Belsat, an independent Polish-based satellite 
television station aimed at Belarus, have 
each been sentenced to two years in prison 
simply for reporting live from a rally in 
Minsk in November 2020; 
Whereas Ihar Losik, a popular Belarusian 
blogger on Telegram, went on a hunger 
strike for 6 weeks to protest the politically- 
motivated charges that he helped organize 
riots after the fraudulent presidential elec-
tion; 
Whereas member states of the Organiza-
tion for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE), of which the United States and 
Belarus are members, invoked paragraph 12 
of the 1991 Moscow Document of the Con-
ference on the Human Dimension of the 
OSCE (Moscow Mechanism) to establish a 
mission of experts to review allegations of 
human rights violations; 
Whereas the OSCE Rapporteur’s Report 
under the Moscow Mechanism on Alleged 
Human Rights Violations related to the pres-
idential elections of August 9, 2020, in 
Belarus, published November 5, 2020, con-
cluded that there was ‘‘overwhelming evi-
dence that the presidential elections of 9 Au-
gust 2020 [had] been falsified and that mas-
sive and systematic human rights violations 
[had] been committed by the Belarusian se-
curity forces in response to peaceful dem-
onstrations and protests’’; 
Whereas women have played a leading role 
in peaceful demonstrations across the coun-
try, protesting the police brutality and mass 
detentions by wearing red and white, car-
rying 
flowers, 
and 
forming 
‘‘solidarity 
chains’’; 
Whereas the information technology (IT) 
industry in Belarus has played a prominent 
role in the democratic movement by de-
manding an end to violent oppression, as 
well as creating safe platforms for dem-
onstrators to communicate and track people 
who have been detained or went missing dur-
ing mass detentions; 
Whereas Belarusian authorities have con-
tinually disrupted internet channels in an 
attempt to limit communication among 
demonstrators and targeted lead technology 
companies and their employees advocating 
for democracy; 
Whereas Belarusian state-owned television 
channels have encouraged violence against 
peaceful demonstrators; 
Whereas a recent survey of IT specialists 
found that 15 percent of IT specialists work-
ing in Belarus have already relocated to 
neighboring countries, and over 40 percent of 
IT specialists no longer want to work in 
Belarus, resulting in a devastating loss of 
talent for Belarus, possibly permanently 
damaging the Belarusian technology indus-
try along with the Belarusian economy; 
Whereas hundreds of former law enforce-
ment officers in Belarus who have defected 
in defiance of illegal orders to commit 
human rights violations and cover up crimes 
against civilians and those who have assisted 
law enforcement officers in defecting have 
faced harassment, financial penalties, arrest, 
detention, and other punitive measures; 
Whereas several peaceful demonstrators 
have died as a result of police violence, in-
cluding 31-year-old Roman Bondrenko who 
was violently beaten by plainclothes police 
officers and, as a result, suffered head inju-
ries that resulted in his death; 
Whereas Belarusian universities continue 
to expel students and dismiss educators and 
researchers for participating in peaceful pro-
tests; 
Whereas child protective services have 
threatened multiple civic activists with ter-
mination of parental rights for bringing 
minor children to peaceful protests; 
Whereas factory workers at state-owned 
enterprises have been continuously harassed 
for trying to organize independent trade 
unions and have been forced to sign political 
letters opposing sanctions by the European 
Union under threat of termination of their 
employment; 
Whereas a transatlantic community of leg-
islators has emerged in support of uplifting 
the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian 
people; 
Whereas international advocacy, including 
by co-host Latvia, succeeded in preventing 
the illegitimate Government of Belarus from 
hosting the 2021 Ice Hockey World Cham-
pionship; 
Whereas the United States, the European 
Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada 
have enacted sanctions and other punitive 
measures against dozens of individuals and 
entities found responsible for the perpetra-
tion of violence against peaceful demonstra-
tors, opposition members, and journalists, 
among others; 
Whereas 
Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka 
con-
tinues to undermine the sovereignty and 
independence of Belarus through efforts to 
integrate Belarus into a so-called ‘‘Union 
States’’ under the control of Russia; 
Whereas the House of Representatives 
passed 
the 
Belarus 
Democracy, 
Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020 with 
unanimous consent, sending a clear message 
of overwhelming, bipartisan support for the 
democratic movement in Belarus; 
Whereas the Belarus Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020 was 
signed into law via the fiscal year 2021 omni-
bus spending bill, expanding the President’s 
authority to impose sanctions related to 
Belarus, including on Russian individuals 
who have undermined Belarus’ sovereignty, 
as well as authorizing increased assistance 
to counter internet censorship and surveil-
lance technology, support women advocating 
for freedom and human rights, and support 
political refugees fleeing the crackdown in 
Belarus, among other things; and 
Whereas the Belarusian opposition, led by 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, organized a Day 
of Solidary on February 7, 2020, where coun-
tries, cities, and political and elected lead-
ers, as well as everyday citizens around the 
world demonstrated their support for the six 
months of historic peaceful protests since 
the fraudulent presidential election that 
took place on August 9, 2020: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) finds that the August 9, 2020, presi-
dential election in Belarus was neither free 
nor fair and, therefore, does not recognize 
the 
government-announced 
results 
or 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka as the legitimate 
President of Belarus; 
(2) calls for new free and fair elections 
under Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe observation;

the right to determine the future of Belarus 
without unwelcome intervention from the 
Russian Federation or any outside actors in 
violation of Belarusian independence and 
sovereignty;

committed by Belarusian authorities, in-
cluding against peaceful demonstrators, civil 
society activists, opposition leaders, stu-
dents, educators, employees at state-owned 
enterprises, medical personnel, and journal-
ists, and calls for such authorities to halt 
any further acts of violence against civil-
ians; 
(5) calls for the immediate release of all 
political prisoners and those unlawfully de-
tained in connection with the peaceful dem-
onstrations including independent journal-
ists and family members of United States 
citizens; 
(6) recognizes the sacrifices and bravery of 
the Belarusian people and the incredible or-
ganization by Belarusian women to peace-
fully demand a free and fair democratic proc-
ess while enduring the state-sponsored vio-
lence that followed the August 9, 2020, elec-
tion; 
(7) calls on Alyaksandr Lukashenka and 
Belarusian authorities to engage in an open 
and constructive dialogue with the opposi-
tion members and other stakeholders to 
bring about a peaceful transition of power; 
(8) calls for the protection of civil society 
actors 
and 
members 
of 
the 
opposition 
against arbitrary arrest and violence while 
conducting peaceful discussions relating to 
the peaceful transition of power in Belarus; 
(9) recognizes the Coordination Council es-
tablished by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as a 
legitimate institution to participate in a 
dialogue on a peaceful transition of power;

and partners to explore avenues in support of 
the democratic movement in Belarus; 
(11) calls for further targeted sanctions co-
ordinated between the United States, the Eu-
ropean Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, 
and 
other 
allies 
and 
partners 
against 
Belarusian 
authorities 
who 
committed 
human rights violations and engaged in ac-
tivities that resulted in the falsification of 
the August 9, 2020, election results; 
(12) encourages when considering, in co-
ordination with transatlantic partners, the 
sanctioning of Belarusian state-owned com-
panies that have directly violated the rights 
of their workers as a result of their partici-
pation in or in connection to the ongoing 
democratic movement in Belarus that the 
Administration take into consideration the 
potential implications of making these com-
panies more vulnerable to takeovers by Rus-
sian or Chinese state-owned companies; 
(13) calls on the transatlantic community 
to review and consider reassessing any finan-
cial 
assistance 
that 
supports 
the 
Lukashenka regime, including participation 
in state debt issuances or procurement con-
tracts; 
(14) supports increasing funds available for 
foreign assistance to Belarusian civil society 
groups as well as legal assistance for activ-
ists and independent journalists, among oth-
ers, as called for in the Belarus Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020; 
(15) urges the President to provide the 
United States Agency for Global Media with 
a surge capacity (as such term is defined in 
section 316 of the United States Inter-
national Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 
6216)) for programs and activities in Belarus, 
including to protect the brave independent 
journalists reporting from within Belarus as 
called for in the Belarus Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020; 
(16) calls for an international investigation 
into the human rights abuses committed 
during and after the August 9, 2020, presi-
dential election; and 
(17) continues to support the aspirations of 
the people of Belarus for democracy, human 
rights, and the rule of law, and reaffirms 
that the fulfillment of such aspirations is 
critical to ensuring the continued strength 
of Belarusian sovereignty and territorial in-
tegrity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
124. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H. Res. 124. 
This resolution, introduced by the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Europe, 
Energy, the Environment and Cyber, 
Mr. KEATING, my good friend, is an ex-
cellent measure that solidifies this 
body’s already strong bipartisan sup-
port for the people of Belarus. I also 
thank the ranking member for his 
work. 
After Alyaksandr Lukashenka stole 
the August 9, 2020, elections, the 
Belarusian people, led by thousands of 
women dressed in white and fearless 
opposition leaders, including Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, peacefully took to 
the streets in historic numbers to de-
mand the right to chart their own 
democratic future, a future free of 
Lukashenka’s dictatorial grip. 
Tragically, but unsurprisingly, these 
peaceful protestors were met with the 
same brutal, violent tactics that have 
defined Lukashenka’s nearly three-dec-
ades-long rule. In his desperate at-
tempt to cling to power, thousands 
were beaten, injured, and illegally de-
tained without due process by security 
forces. Meanwhile, critical access to 
the 
internet, 
international 
broad-
casting, and other forms of commu-
nication and expression were cut off to 
suppress the dissent, control the flow 
of information, and prevent the opposi-
tion from organizing any further. 
But the resolve of the Belarusian 
people, the brave, peaceful protestors, 
the opposition in exile, and the vibrant 
Belarusian diaspora has not wavered. 
The resolve of the United States, our 
allies, and this body must not waver ei-
ther. 
With the passing of this resolution, 
the House shines a spotlight on the il-
legitimacy of the Lukashenka regime 
and his abhorrent human rights viola-
tions. 
We must continue to build on the 
work 
of 
the 
Belarus 
Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 
2020, an effort led by another distin-
guished member of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee and, as indicated by 
Ranking Member MCCAUL, a longtime 
champion for human rights in Belarus, 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. We thank 
him for his work. 
By passing this good, bipartisan reso-
lution, the House will strengthen its 
longstanding commitment and record 
on democracy and human rights. We 
will continue to demonstrate that we 
stand in solidarity with the freedom- 
loving Belarusians, who continue to 
struggle for their fundamental demo-
cratic and human rights every day. We 
do this hand in hand with our allies 
and partners across the Atlantic. 
Madam Speaker, I stand today not 
only to support this measure, but in 
support of democracy and the sanctity 
of the democratic process and soli-
darity with the people of Belarus. 
This is a very important resolution. I 
support it and I urge all of my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to join 
my colleagues today to express our 
support for the people of Belarus and 
their democratic aspirations. 
There is no question that Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka rigged the presidential 
election in Belarus this past August. 
He is an illegitimate leader who will 
never be recognized by the community 
of democratic nations. The scale of the 
electoral fraud was unprecedented, as 
was 
the 
violent 
crackdown 
by 
Lukashenka’s cronies afterwards. 
The reports of peaceful protestors 
being beaten, tortured, and arbitrarily 
detained and killed are appalling. In a 
cowardly attempt to conceal their hei-
nous crimes, the regime has repressed 
independent media, disrupted internet 
access, 
and 
expelled 
and 
detained 
countless journalists. 
Given this despicable human rights 
situation in Belarus, I commend the 
Biden administration’s decision today 
to 
renew 
sanctions 
against 
nine 
Belarusian state-owned enterprises. 
Despite the terror inflicted upon 
them, the Belarusian people have re-
fused to relent. They continue to de-
mand a free and fair vote. Their cour-
age is truly inspiring. 
This resolution reminds the corrupt 
Lukashenka regime that the United 
States Congress supports the people of 
Belarus. We echo their calls for the im-
mediate release of more than 300 polit-
ical prisoners and all of those unlaw-
fully detained by the regime. We also 
join them in demanding new, free, and 
fair elections to be held in Belarus. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr. KEATING), the distin-
guished chair of the Subcommittee on 
Europe, Energy, the Environment and 
Cyber; an esteemed member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee; and the author 
of this important bill. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, my friend, GREGORY 
MEEKS of New York, for yielding and 
for his leadership on this issue. 
I also thank the ranking member, my 
friend and colleague, MICHAEL MCCAUL 
of Texas, for his support and leader-
ship. I also thank the longtime leader 
of this cause, Representative CHRIS 
SMITH, for his support. I thank them 
both for their bipartisan support. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H. Res. 124. 
Today marks just over 8 months 
since an openly fraudulent presidential 
election took place in Belarus. In that 
time, Belarusians have made it clear 
by marching in the street en masse, 
with a pronounced leadership of brave 
women, that they want and need de-
mocracy in Belarus. 
Despite the peaceful nature of these 
events, protestors have been beaten 
and arrested, and opposition leaders 
have either been forced out of the 
country, 
like 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya; or jailed, like Maria 
Kalesnikava. 
This resolution, inspired by the cour-
age of those taking to the streets to de-
fend democracy, makes it clear to the 
people of Belarus and to the inter-
national community that the United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1937 
April 19, 2021 
States House of Representatives has re-
viewed the facts and determined that 
the 2020 Belarus presidential election 
was neither free nor fair, and that 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka cannot and 
must not be recognized as Belarus’s le-
gitimate president. 
The resolution also strongly con-
demns the heinous human rights viola-
tions that have been committed by 
Belarusian authorities and underlines 
that Belarus is a sovereign nation, 
whose people have the right to self-de-
termination. 
As chairman of the House Foreign 
Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, En-
ergy, the Environment and Cyber, I 
held a hearing in March, where we 
heard firsthand from presidential can-
didate 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya 
about the unprecedented violence and 
verbal, physical, emotional, and sexual 
assault of peaceful protestors. In their 
fight for democracy, the Belarusian 
people have endured unprecedented re-
pression and many protestors have 
been left severely wounded, and at 
least eight have been murdered by this 
reprehensible regime. 
Madam Speaker, this resolution is a 
vital signal of support for the demo-
cratic movement in Belarus, that their 
sacrifice will not be forgotten, and 
their calls for recognition will not go 
unanswered. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this resolution and send 
a clear message that the United States 
is paying close attention to the human 
rights situation in Belarus and will 
continue to support the people of 
Belarus in their fight for a new, free, 
and fair election. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the ranking 
member of the Foreign Affairs Sub-
committee on Africa, Global Health, 
and Global Human Rights; and also the 
author of the Belarus Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act 
that was signed into law last year. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
yielding and for his leadership, as well 
as Chairman MEEKS. I especially want 
to thank Chairman KEATING for au-
thoring this very, very important reso-
lution and for his hearing that he held 
in March on the situation in Belarus. 
Madam Speaker, the resolution con-
demns Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s ongo-
ing and ever-worsening brutality and 
crackdown on peaceful protestors. 
As my colleagues know, the leading 
opposition 
presidential 
candidate, 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who almost 
certainly won the election in August 
and helped form the Coordination 
Council as a means to seek a peaceful 
transition of power, needs our con-
sistent and robust support and encour-
agement. 
Today, Ms. Tsikhanouskaya is in 
exile in Lithuania, where she continues 
to rally the Belarusian people and the 
world and to demand democracy and 
human rights for her nation, no matter 
how long it takes. 
More than 8 months have passed 
since the stolen August presidential 
election, and about 5 months since 
President Trump signed the Belarus 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Sov-
ereignty Act of 2020, which I authored. 
Let me point out to my colleagues 
that I first authored the Belarus De-
mocracy Act in the year 2004. It was 
enacted into law and reauthorized in 
2006 and 2011. What it did was focus on 
denying visas to human rights abusers 
and made people who are singled out 
ineligible for participating in our econ-
omy. 
In retaliation, I was told I could not 
visit Belarus. I was denied a visa re-
peatedly. I finally got there twice and 
raised 
human 
rights 
issues 
with 
Lukashenka himself. 
Let me just say that a resolution like 
this has real impact. Just last week, as 
a result of an outcry from human 
rights organizations, the government 
released Tatsiana Hatsura-Yavorska, 
the director of the Watch Docs Film 
Festival in Belarus, and they dropped 
the charges because of the outcry. 
Again, I want to thank Mr. KEATING, 
the chairman, for doing this. 
Let me remind my colleagues, too, 
that the Russians continue to play a 
very, very destructive role in the coun-
try. This past week alone, Russian au-
thorities detained Yuras Zyankovich, a 
Belarusian lawyer and U.S. citizen. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER), a member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Res. 124, a reso-
lution to support the people of Belarus 
in their efforts against corruption and 
kleptocracy. 
On August 9, 2020, Belarus held a 
presidential election marred by cred-
ible reports of widespread election ma-
nipulation. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
the 
Belarusian 
dictator, 
Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka, who has ruled with an 
iron fist for nearly three decades, com-
manded an authoritarian 80 percent of 
the vote. 
Since 
August, 
Belarusians 
have 
taken to the streets peacefully to ex-
press their desire for self-determina-
tion. Instead of heeding their calls, the 
regime has responded with extreme vi-
olence, arbitrary detention, torture, 
and other systematic violations of 
human rights. 
This resolution sends a clear message 
that 
we 
in 
Congress 
support 
the 
Belarusian people and their aspirations 
for democracy, human rights, and the 
rule of law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
from all of my colleagues. Passage of 
this resolution will send a message 
that we in Congress stand against the 
violent crackdown of the Lukashenka 
regime and stand with the people of 
Belarus. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Today, the people of Belarus know 
that they are not alone, that they have 
the support of the United States Con-
gress and the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
b 1815 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I join 
with Ranking Member MCCAUL
that 
this resolution makes it clear that the 
United States will not be silent on 
human rights violations as perpetrated 
by the illegitimate Lukashenko regime 
and we stand with the Belarusian peo-
ple in their peaceful fight for democ-
racy. I hope all join in supporting this 
resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 124, as amended. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

YOUNG AFRICAN LEADERS 
INITIATIVE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 965) to establish a comprehensive

tance and it is vital for the United States to 
support strong and enduring partnerships 
with the next generation of African leaders; 
and

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 965. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 965, the YALI Act of 2021, 
introduced by Representatives KAREN 
BASS and CHRIS SMITH. 
Since 2010 the Young African Leaders 
Initiative has been building the next 
generation of Africa’s youth to lead the 
way in civic engagement, entrepre-
neurship, and business development. 
We must remember that by 2050, al-
most one-third of the world’s popu-
lation will be in Africa, and the United 
States must continue to forge strong 
ties with our African partners and cul-
tivate its youth for a future of prin-
cipled leadership. 
By helping Africa’s young leaders, 
YALI remains an important avenue for 
promoting U.S. foreign policy goals in 
Africa. It will be key in strengthening 
our partnerships with African coun-
tries that are working to create the 
pathway for Africa’s youth to make 
positive and enduring impacts on their 
communities. 
If passed, H.R. 965 will provide a 
strong mandate for the implementa-
tion and congressional oversight of 
YALI and its key initiatives, including 
the U.S.-based Mandela Washington 
Fellowship and the Regional Leader-
ship Centers established throughout 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
This, too, is a very important bill. I 
support it and urge my colleagues to do 
the same. With that, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 965, the Young African Leaders 
Initiative Act, led by Representative 
BASS and Representative SMITH. 
YALI provides fellowship opportuni-
ties at U.S. universities and other 
training programs at Regional Leader-
ship Centers throughout sub-Saharan 
Africa on leadership skills, entrepre-
neurship, and effective public adminis-
tration. 
Not only is this an investment in fu-
ture generations of African leaders, but 
this is also effective diplomacy. At a 
time when the Chinese Communist 
Party is ramping up exchange pro-
grams across the continent and estab-
lishing Confucius Institutes, programs 
like YALI are critical to providing al-
ternate opportunities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important measure. I yield back the 
balance of my time.

H1939 
April 19, 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia 
(Mr. 
CONNOLLY), 
the 
distin-
guished president of the NATO Par-
liamentary Assembly and esteemed 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of Ms. BASS, the author 
of this legislation, the Young African 
Leaders Initiative Act of 2021. 
The chairman has described the bill. 
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion, as we help try to nourish and de-
velop the next generation of African 
leadership. 
This is an important initiative for 
the United States to build on those 
ties, to build those bridges. I commend 
Congresswoman BASS for her leader-
ship on the YALI program and for this 
legislation. I urge its passage. I will in-
clude the full statement of Ms. BASS in 
the RECORD. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I will 
just say quickly thanks to Representa-
tives BASS and CHRIS SMITH. This will 
help build the next generation of Afri-
ca’s youth. I hope all my colleagues 
will join me in voting for this very im-
portant bill. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 965, the Young African Lead-
ers Initiative Act of 2021, introduced by my 
good friend and Chairwoman of the Africa, 
Global Health, and Human Rights Sub-
committee, Congresswoman KAREN BASS. Her 
leadership both on the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee and on this bill is unparalleled, and 
I am honored to speak on her behalf today. 
I also wish to thank Chairman MEEKS and 
ranking Member MCCAUL for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the House floor. 
The YALI Act of 2021, is a bipartisan bill 
that seeks to build the capacity of young Afri-
can leaders in Africa in the areas of civic en-
gagement, entrepreneurship, and business de-
velopment by: 
Offering professional development and a 
global network to share expertise, including in 
the areas of civic leadership, elections, human 
rights, good governance, and public manage-
ment; 
Providing increased economic and technical 
assistance to young leaders and entre-
preneurs; and strengthening business and 
economic ties between the United States and 
the continent; 
Awarding Mandela Washington Fellowships 
to young leaders who have had a positive im-
pact in their communities and demonstrated 
strong capabilities in entrepreneurship, innova-
tion, public service, and leadership; 
Establishing regional leadership centers in 
sub-Saharan Africa allowing young leaders to 
strengthen their skills and aptitude in entrepre-
neurship, innovation, public service, and lead-
ership. 
The YALI program has two vital components 
that will be carried out by participants in the 
program. The U.S.-based component led by 
the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
Administrator for USAID will include the fol-
lowing: 
The Mandela Washington Fellows will par-
ticipate in a six-week Leadership Institute at a 
U.S.-based university or college focusing on 
business, civic engagement, or public man-
agement. The sessions will include profes-
sional networking opportunities, community 
service, cultural activities, academic learning, 
and leadership training. 
The Mandela Washington Fellows will also 
participate in the annual Mandela Washington 
Fellowship Summit held in Washington, D.C., 
which will provide an opportunity to meet with 
U.S. leaders from the private, public, and 
NGO sectors. 
The YALI program was built on the premise 
of young leaders strengthening their knowl-
edge and skills at U.S. institutions, connecting 
with other Africans from different regions and 
countries in Africa, and ensuring young lead-
ers can harness their skills and take them 
back to their home countries while strength-
ening their own business, public, and civic 
spaces. 
The YALI Act of 2021 would also continue 
to allow the United States to support and help 
strengthen the Africa-based component of the 
program including: 
Quality leadership training, professional de-
velopment, networking, and online courses for 
Mandela Washington Fellowship alumni when 
they return to their home countries; 
Opportunities for networking with alumni of 
the Mandela Washington Fellowship; alumni of 
participants at the YALI Regional Leadership 
Centers; and American and African profes-
sionals and experts; and 
Opportunities through the United States Afri-
ca Development Foundation to facilitate pro-
fessional development and sharing of exper-
tise in the home countries of Mandela Wash-
ington Fellowship alumni and throughout the 
African continent. 
Through the implementation of the YALI Act 
of 2021, the United States will: 
Promote U.S. policy goals in Africa by pro-
viding tools and resources to help young Afri-
can leaders develop important skills and con-
nections through online campaigns and public 
diplomacy initiatives; and establish a system 
for monitoring, evaluating, and continued im-
provement of the YALI program. 
The bipartisan support of H.R. 965 shows 
that this bill is critical to U.S. national security. 
It also highlights that our relationship with Afri-
ca is a priority, and we want to continue to re-
build and strengthen our partnership in trade 
and investment, peace and security, and 
human rights and good governance, because 
it is in the best interest of the United States 
and Africa. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I rise in support 
H.R. 965, of which I am a cosponsor, intro-
duced by my friend and colleague, chair-
woman of the Africa Subcommittee, KAREN 
BASS, to strengthen and formalize our Young 
African Leaders Initiative program. 
The YALI program identifies and invites 
young leaders from across the African con-
tinent to participate in training programs that 
enhance their leadership skills. Among these 
individuals, some are selected to participate in 
the Mandela Washington Fellowship here in 
the United States. 
I have met and spoken with YALI leaders 
who have participated in the Mandela Fellow-
ship program through Rutgers University in my 
home state of New Jersey. They are the lead-
ers of tomorrow. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this legislation, and again, thank 
you to Chairwoman BASS for her leadership. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 965, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

PROTECTION OF SAUDI 
DISSIDENTS ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1392) to protect Saudi dissidents 
in the United States, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1392 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protection 
of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Jamal Khashoggi, a United States resi-
dent, Saudi journalist, and Washington Post 
columnist, was killed and dismembered in 
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on 
October 2, 2018. 
(2) At the time of his murder, Khashoggi 
was living in Virginia under an ‘‘O’’ visa and 
was in the process of applying for a perma-
nent residency. 
(3) A report by the Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence (ODNI) found that 
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, 
Turkey to capture or kill Khashoggi. 
(4) The assessment of the ODNI was based 
on ‘‘the Crown Prince’s control of decision-
making in the Kingdom, the direct involve-
ment of a key adviser and members of Mu-
hammad bin Salman’s protective detail in 
the operation, and the Crown Prince’s sup-
port for using violent measures to silence 
dissidents abroad’’. 
(5) The report also reiterates that ‘‘the 
Crown Prince has had absolute control of the 
Kingdom’s security and intelligence organi-
zations’’ since 2017.

priate’’ unless an applicable waiver of the 
duty is granted by the appropriate official

SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members have 5 legisla-
tive days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 1392, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1392, the Protection of 
Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021, an impor-
tant bill introduced by the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Though Saudi Arabia has taken steps 
to reform, its progress has been marred 
by the Saudi Government’s brutality 
against dissidents and most notably 
the detention and abuse of numerous 
peaceful protesters and the brutal kill-
ing of Washington Post journalist and 
U.S. resident, Jamal Khashoggi. 
The Biden administration’s release of 
the DNI report was a good step toward 
accountability for the killing of Jamal 
Khashoggi, but further steps need to be 
taken. 
This bill imposes reasonable limits 
on U.S. weapons transfers to Saudi in-
telligence agencies shown to be in-
volved 
in 
the 
killing 
of 
Jamal 
Khashoggi 
and 
political 
repression 
until such repression and abuse of dis-
sidents comes to an end. 
In conclusion, let me be clear, noth-
ing in this legislation would deny the 
Saudi Government the ability to de-
fend its territory against attacks from 
external threats or inhibit its ability 
to defend the United States military, 
diplomatic personnel, or facilities in 
the kingdom. 
It is important that the United 
States stands clear on these matters, 
speaking loudly in defense of human 
rights and taking action when they are 
grossly violated. 
I ask the support of all my colleagues 
to vote for this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, April 16, 2021. 
Hon. ADAM B. SCHIFF, 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCHIFF: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 1392, Protection of 
Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021. I appreciate 
your willingness to work cooperatively on 
this legislation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence 
under House Rule X, and that your Com-
mittee will forgo action on H.R. 1392 to expe-
dite floor consideration. I further acknowl-
edge that the inaction of your Committee 
with respect to the bill does not waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over the matters 
contained in the bill that fall within your ju-
risdiction. I will also support the appoint-
ment of House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence conferees during any House- 
Senate conference convened on this legisla-
tion. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chair. 
HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES, PER-
MANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON IN-
TELLIGENCE, 
April 19, 2021. 
Hon. GREGORY MEEKS, 
Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN MEEKS: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 1392, the Protection of 
Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021. Certain provi-
sions in the legislation fall within the juris-
diction of the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence, as set forth in Rule X 
of the House of Representatives for the 117th 
Congress. 
In the interest of permitting your com-
mittee to proceed expeditiously to floor con-
sideration of this important bill, I am will-
ing to waive this committee’s right to se-
quential referral. By waiving consideration 
of the H.R. 1392, the Intelligence Committee 
does not waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over the subjects contained in the bill 
which fall within Intelligence’s Rule X juris-
diction. 
Please place this letter into the committee 
report for the Protection of Saudi Dissidents 
Act and into the Congressional Record dur-
ing consideration of the measure on the 
House floor. Thank you for the cooperative 
spirit in which you have worked regarding 
this matter and others between our respec-
tive committees. 
Sincerely, 
ADAM B. SCHIFF, 
Chairman. 
Mrs. WAGNER. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman MEEKS
and Representative 
CONNOLLY for working on this com-
promise text for the Protection of 
Saudi Dissidents Act that strikes an 
important balance. 
The bill we are voting on today 
shows that we can strongly advocate 
for human rights in Saudi Arabia and 
for its nationals abroad without leav-
ing Saudi Arabia and Americans in the 
region vulnerable to threats from Iran 
and other malign actors. This bill 
shows we can protect our values and 
our security interests at the same 
time. 
I urge all Members to support this 
legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), distinguished 
president of the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly, esteemed member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, and author 
of this important bill. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank, again, my 
good friend Mr. MEEKS, the distin-
guished chairman of the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee; Mr. MCCAUL, the 
ranking member; and my good friend 
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) for their 
support on this bipartisan effort. 
We cannot sit idly by in this body 
and watch an American resident, my 
constituent, brutally murdered and dis-
membered in the consulate of Saudi 
Arabia in Istanbul, Turkey. We cannot 
allow that to go unaddressed. The 
human rights abuse that represents is 
all too characteristic of the methods 
used by certain forces in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia against dissidents. 
America remains the beacon of hope 
for those who seek freedom, basic sim-
ple freedoms to express themselves po-
litically, religiously, and to be able to 
assemble peacefully. This bill ends the 
impunity against those voices of dis-
sent. This bill provides that beacon of 
hope for so many who look to this body 
for protection and safe harbor. 
I urge passage of H.R. 1392, Protec-
tion of Saudi Dissidents Act, which 
passed our committee unanimously, 
with the enlightened leadership of our 
distinguished 
chairman, 
GREGORY 
MEEKS, who has always committed 
himself to human rights. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, 
H.R. 1392, the Protection of Saudi Dissidents 
Act of 2021. 
Let me start by thanking my friend and the 
Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Mr. GREGORY MEEKS, for his leadership in 
bringing this important bill to the floor. 
In February of this year, more than two 
years after the cold blooded murder of Wash-
ington Post journalist, and my constituent, 
Jamal Khashoggi, the Director of National In-
telligence released a previously classified U.S. 
intelligence report. 
The report clearly stated: ‘‘We assess that 
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, 
Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1942 
April 19, 2021 
It continued: ‘‘We base this assessment on 
the Crown Prince’s control of decision making 
in the Kingdom, the direct involvement of a 
key adviser and members of Muhammad bin 
Salman’s protective detail in the operation, 
and the Crown Prince’s support for using vio-
lent measures to silence dissidents abroad, in-
cluding Khashoggi.’’ 
Finally, it concluded that ‘‘since 2017, the 
Crown Prince has had absolute control of the 
Kingdom’s security and intelligence organiza-
tions, making it highly unlikely that Saudi offi-
cials would have carried out an operation of 
this nature without the Crown Prince’s author-
ization.’’ 
We’ve always known, beyond a shadow of 
a doubt, that Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Salman directed the assassination of Jamal 
Khashoggi. 
We also know that this operation is part of 
a broad and ongoing effort to use violence to 
intimidate and silence dissidents abroad. 
And yet, the previous administration shield-
ed Crown Prince MBS and Saudi Arabia from 
accountability, signaling this kind of abhorrent 
behavior was somehow ok, inviting further 
atrocities. 
That impunity ends with this bill. 
The Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act will 
stop the Kingdom and the Crown Prince from 
acting with impunity to commit gross human 
rights abuses like these. 
My bill is targeted and does four specific 
things: 
One: It limits arms exports to Saudi intel-
ligence, internal security, or law enforcement 
entities if the President finds that Saudi Arabia 
has engaged in the following activities: 
Forced repatriation, intimidation, or killing of 
dissidents in other countries; 
The unjust imprisonment in Saudi Arabia of 
United States citizens or residents or the plac-
ing of travel restrictions on them or their family 
members; and 
The torture of detainees in the custody of 
the Government of Saudi Arabia 
Two: It requires the closure of one or more 
Saudi diplomatic facilities if the President finds 
that Saudi Arabia is using diplomatic or con-
sular personnel to harass or harm Saudi na-
tionals in the United States. 
Three: It requires a report on whether Saudi 
Arabia has been engaged in a consistent pat-
tern of acts of intimidation or harassment di-
rected against individuals in the United States. 
Four: Finally, it requires a report on whether 
the U.S. intelligence community fulfilled its 
duty to warn Jamal Khashoggi of threats to his 
life. 
These provisions are long overdue. 
This bill comes after years of fighting for the 
victims of Saudi Arabia’s war on dissent. 
I have spoken out on behalf of Dr. Saad 
Aljabri and activist and former political prisoner 
Loujain Al-Hathloul. I am currently fighting for 
my constituents, Salah Al-Haider and Aziza Al- 
Yousef, as they battle political persecution in 
Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia will not change their ways un-
less we act. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in sending a 
message to human rights defenders, dis-
sidents, and journalists worldwide and reaffirm 
the unshakeable American commitment to 
basic rights and freedoms. 
I ask my colleagues to end the ‘‘two-year 
pageant of impunity’’ by finally holding Saudi 
Arabia accountable for Jamal Khashoggi’s bru-
tal murder. 
I ask my colleagues to support the Protec-
tion of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, let me 
just thank again Representative GERRY 
CONNOLLY for this critical bill holding 
Saudi Arabia accountable for its brutal 
suppression of dissidents. 
Let me also say this helps ensure 
that the Saudi diplomatic facilities are 
not used as a staging ground for their 
efforts to suppress dissidents. 
It is crucial that the United States 
stand strongly in defense of basic 
rights and freedom of expression and 
not allow U.S. weapons or support to be 
used by Saudi Arabia for the purposes 
of intimidating, abusing, or even kill-
ing peaceful Saudi dissidents. 
I hope my colleagues will join me. 
With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 1392, the Protection of 
Saudi Dissidents Act. Saudi Arabia is one of 
our strongest partners in the Middle East. That 
does not mean, however, that we should cast 
a blind eye to the Kingdom’s most brutal 
human rights violations, including the murder 
of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident. 
This bill, which passed out of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee with unanimous support, 
would prohibit arms sales to Saudi Arabia’s 
security services until the President certifies 
the Saudi government is not conducting fla-
grant human rights violations such as torture, 
the intimidation and assassination of dis-
sidents, and the unjust imprisonment of U.S. 
citizens. 
America is a beacon throughout the world 
because of our commitment to democratic val-
ues and our commitment to human rights. Our 
actions must match our convictions. We can 
and should leverage our close relationship to 
promote human rights in Saudi Arabia. This 
bill would do exactly that—sending a message 
to our ally that if it continues to engage in 
such actions, there will be consequences. I 
urge my colleagues to support this important 
legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1392, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SOUTHEAST ASIA STRATEGIES 
ACT 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 1083) to require 
a strategy for engagement with South-
east Asia and the Association of South-
east Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1083 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Southeast 
Asia Strategy Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Southeast Asia is the fulcrum of the 
Indo-Pacific region, providing both a geo-
graphic and maritime link between East and 
South Asia. 
(2) The Association of Southeast Asian Na-
tions 
(ASEAN), 
a 
regional 
intergovern-
mental organization, remains central to the 
Indo-Pacific region’s institutional architec-
ture and to United States foreign policy to-
ward the region. 
(3) The United States has reaffirmed that 
the security and sovereignty of its Southeast 
Asian allies and partners, including a strong, 
independent ASEAN, remain vital to the 
prosperity and stability of the Indo-Pacific 
region. 
(4) The United States has committed to 
deepen longstanding alliances and partner-
ships with a range of Southeast Asian na-
tions, including by promoting our shared 
values, democracy, human rights, and civil 
society. 
(5) Since the end of the Second World War, 
United States investments in strengthening 
alliances and partnerships with Southeast 
Asian nations have yielded tremendous re-
turns for United States interests, as working 
with and through these alliances and part-
nerships have increased the region’s ability 
to address common challenges. 
(6) ASEAN member states are critical 
United States security partners in pro-
tecting the freedom and openness of the mar-
itime domain and preventing violent extre-
mism and the trafficking of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
(7) ASEAN member states have contrib-
uted significantly to regional disaster moni-
toring and management and emergency re-
sponse through initiatives such as the 
ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humani-
tarian Assistance on Disaster Management, 
an inter-governmental organization that fa-
cilitates 
coordination 
and 
cooperation 
among ASEAN member states and inter-
national organizations in times of emer-
gency. 
(8) According to the 2018 ASEAN Business 
Outlook Survey, ASEAN member states are 
vital to the prosperity of the United States 
economy and exports to ASEAN economies 
support more than 500,000 jobs in the United 
States. 
(9) The United States and ASEAN have es-
tablished a new strategic partnership that 
will enhance cooperation across the eco-
nomic, political-security, and people-to-peo-
ple pillars of the relationship. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) deepen cooperation with ASEAN and 
ASEAN member states in the interest of pro-
moting peace, security, and stability in the 
Indo-Pacific region; 
(2) affirm the importance of ASEAN cen-
trality and ASEAN-led mechanisms in the 
evolving institutional architecture of the 
Indo-Pacific region; and 
(3) establish and communicate a com-
prehensive strategy toward the Indo-Pacific 
region that articulates— 
(A) the role and importance of Southeast 
Asia to the United States; 
(B) the value of the United States-ASEAN 
relationship;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1945 
April 19, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the bipartisan Southeast Asia Strategy 
Act, of which I am a proud Democratic 
lead on the bill. 
In 2017, Congresswoman WAGNER and 
I cofounded the Congressional Caucus 
on ASEAN to strengthen our Nation’s 
relationships 
in 
Southeast 
Asia. 
ASEAN and its member nations are of 
critical 
importance 
to 
the 
United 
States. Enduring organizations like 
ASEAN will be key to maintaining a 
free and open Indo-Pacific. 
The United States is already making 
key investments in the region along-
side allies and partners like Japan, 
Australia, and India—notably, the re-
cent Quad commitment to fund, manu-
facture, and distribute vaccines across 
Southeast Asia. 
The Southeast Asia Strategy Act will 
build on these investments by rein-
forcing ASEAN centrality as U.S. pol-
icy and directing the Secretary of 
State to develop a comprehensive plan 
for engaging the institution and the re-
gion it represents. 
This legislation comes at a crucial 
time 
for 
Southeast 
Asia, 
notably 
amidst the deteriorating situation in 
Myanmar following the recent military 
coup. 
Given the significant and rapidly de-
veloping events in the region, Congress 
must send a message of the importance 
of the region by passing this bill. 
It is also important that the adminis-
tration nominates a U.S. Ambassador 
to ASEAN as quickly as possible. It is 
also imperative that the administra-
tion consistently sends senior officials 
to regional summits. Our Nation needs 
a voice in Southeast Asia now more 
than ever. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this leg-
islation and help build stronger ties be-
tween the United States and the peo-
ples of Southeast Asia. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1083, the Southeast Asia Strategy 
Act, important legislation that I intro-
duced to ensure the United States en-
gages proactively and meaningfully in 
a critical region of the world. 
This powerhouse region joins the In-
dian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions 
and serves as a conduit for global 
trade. The Southeast Asian states are 
increasingly vital to the prosperity of 
the U.S. economy, generating hundreds 
of thousands of American jobs. 
The People’s Republic of China, eager 
to undermine U.S. interests in this key 
region, is aggressively working to ex-
pand its influence in Southeast Asia. It 
seeks to exploit its predatory invest-
ment, development, and trade policies; 
illegal military installations in the 
South China Sea; and disinformation 
campaigns to coerce countries to ac-
cept its agenda. 
The United States has long enjoyed 
strong relations with Southeast Asia, 
and it must now fully realize this stra-
tegic partnership. The Southeast Asia 
Strategic Act will ensure the United 
States develops and communicates a 
coherent regional strategy that ad-
dresses all aspects of the relationship, 
from trade and humanitarian goals to 
diplomatic and security arrangements. 
We have a national interest in sus-
taining U.S. leadership in Southeast 
Asia, supporting human rights and re-
spect for democratic freedoms, and ar-
ticulating our strategic priorities. 
We will find willing partners in our 
many friends and allies in the region 
that share our grave concerns regard-
ing China’s belligerence and growing 
power. 
I thank Representative CASTRO, with 
whom I co-chair the Congressional 
Caucus on ASEAN, for working with 
me on this legislation. Congress’ strong 
bipartisan support for U.S. engagement 
in Southeast Asia sends an unmistak-
able message of American resolve and 
leadership to the region. 
Madam Speaker, I again urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1083, the South-
east Asia Strategy Act, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
b 1945 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume for the purpose of clos-
ing. 
H.R. 1083, the Southeast Asia Strate-
gies Act, introduced by Mrs. WAGNER, 
is important legislation that will re-
commit the United States to strength-
ening and deepening our ties to south-
east Asia and the ASEAN economic 
union. This bill will reinforce the 
United States’ cooperation with coun-
tries in the Indo-Pacific region and lay 
the groundwork for improved engage-
ment and increased prosperity for 
America and its partner nations. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will join me in supporting this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 1083. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 241) to reauthor-
ize the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef 
Conservation Act of 1998. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 241 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Tropical

SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION. 
Section 806(d) of the Tropical Forest and 
Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 2431d(d)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following new paragraphs: 
‘‘(9) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2022. 
‘‘(10) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2023. 
‘‘(11) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2024. 
‘‘(12) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025. 
‘‘(13) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2026.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO) and the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) each will con-
trol 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 241. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 241, the Tropical Forest 
and Coral Reef Conservation Reauthor-
ization Act of 2021, introduced by Mr. 
CHABOT. 
In this Congress, the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee aims to reprioritize 
and redouble our legislative efforts re-
lated to the environment, conserva-
tion, and climate change. Climate 
change already poses a significant 
threat, and what we do now will sig-
nificantly impact how damaging cli-
mate change will be in the years to 
come. 
If we do not act now, we will fail to 
mitigate the adverse effects posed by 
climate change. We will see growing 
food insecurity, migration and conflict, 
threatening our shared interests and 
security. 
President Biden has already set a 
positive, ambitious agenda for inter-
national climate action. His first sum-
mit, the Climate Leaders Summit, will 
take place this very week, on April 22, 
during which the United States will re-
claim its leadership role in galvanizing 
international support for protecting 
our planet. 
We will continue to work closely 
with other nations in the lead-up to 
the U.N. Climate Change Conference in 
Glasgow this November and beyond, 
understanding that nothing short of an 
international response can meet this 
incredible challenge. 
We have our work cut out for us, no 
doubt, which is why I am pleased to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1946 
April 19, 2021 
bring forth this excellent bipartisan 
measure that would reauthorize the 
Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Con-
servation Act. This highly successful 
debt-for-nature program has yielded 
tangible environmental benefits and 
returns on investment since first en-
acted in 1998. It offers eligible coun-
tries the opportunity to reduce debt 
owed to the United States when they 
invest in local ecologically and eco-
nomically vital forest and coral reef 
ecosystems. 
It is a win-win situation. According 
to the Congressional Research Service, 
since 1998, restructured debt agree-
ments have saved more than 67 million 
acres of tropical forests in countries 
such as Botswana, Brazil, the Phil-
ippines, 
and 
Indonesia. 
They 
help 
strengthen civil society in conserva-
tion and environmental protection ef-
forts and build public-private partner-
ships in developing countries, thereby 
advancing U.S. international develop-
ment and democracy objectives. 
Furthermore, these agreements help 
reduce the debt in these developing 
countries, lessening fiscal pressures, 
promoting capital market reforms, and 
stimulating economic growth while 
helping to protect the environment. 
The 
world’s 
forests 
are 
nature’s 
lungs, and the ocean’s coral reefs sup-
port a quarter of all marine life. This 
legislation puts in place economic in-
centives that can help drive good envi-
ronmental 
stewardship, 
while 
pro-
moting robust democracies and eco-
nomic growth overseas. 
I am pleased to support this impor-
tant bill and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise this evening 
in support of H.R. 241, the Tropical 
Forest and Coral Reef Conservation 
Act of 2021, bipartisan legislation that 
I introduced along with my Democratic 
colleague, Mr. SHERMAN of California, 
earlier this year. 
Developing countries are home to 
some of the world’s most endangered 
and biologically diverse tropical for-
ests and coral reefs. These critical eco-
systems support the livelihoods of local 
populations, not to mention an abun-
dance of animal species. Coral reefs are 
critical to the world’s fish stocks and 
are magnets for tourism and the ac-
companying economic growth. It is in 
the interest of the whole world to pro-
tect and responsibly manage both trop-
ical rainforests and coral reefs. 
Unfortunately, however, whether it 
is deforestation, pollution, overfishing, 
or some other cause, these vital nat-
ural resources are threatened across 
the globe. 
Today’s legislation seeks to safe-
guard tropical forests and coral reefs 
by revitalizing the Tropical Forest and 
Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1998. 
Since the introduction of this legisla-
tion 23 years ago, this effort has been 
led by Ohio’s great Senator, ROB 
PORTMAN, who was in the House at that 
time and who is leading the effort in 
the Senate one more time before he 
leaves office. Congressman SHERMAN 
and I were cosponsors of that effort 
back in 1998, and we are proud of its re-
sults over the years. 
This program has already protected, 
as my colleague from Texas mentioned, 
67 million acres of tropical forests 
across the globe. In terms of carbon 
emission, that is the equivalent of tak-
ing 11 million cars off the road. 
This 
program 
does 
development 
right. It forgives debt, which some de-
veloping 
nations 
owe 
the 
United 
States, in exchange for investment in 
local conservation. Instead of pro-
viding a handout with questionable re-
sults, the debt forgiveness comes with 
requirements that ensure that the 
money grows local economies and ben-
efits those who rely on healthy eco-
systems the most. 
Also, by assisting developing coun-
tries 
to 
properly 
manage 
and 
sustainably 
develop 
their 
own 
re-
sources, it follows the old adage of 
‘‘teaching a man to fish’’ so that the 
American taxpayer doesn’t have to 
keep providing the fish. 
Our constituents back home are 
rightfully skeptical oftentimes about 
foreign aid because we have a lot of in 
effective programs that spend their 
money year after year without moving 
countries towards self-reliance. We owe 
it to the American taxpayers to ensure 
that aid programs are targeted, effec-
tive, and come to an end. H.R. 241 is all 
three. 
Further, due to the peculiar struc-
ture of the type of debt this program 
forgives, developing countries would 
not have been paying back the portion 
that we are forgiving anytime soon 
anyway. A lot of it has already been 
outstanding for 10, 20, or even 30 years. 
Since the U.S. is unlikely to recoup the 
debt in a reasonable timeframe any-
way, we might as well get something in 
return that benefits those countries, 
benefits us, and really benefits the en-
tire world and those ecosystems and 
those forests and the animals that re-
side there and the coral reefs and the 
fish and other life that is there. So, 
really, it benefits so many. 
Finally, our legislation is one more 
tool to counter China. Whereas China’s 
One Belt One Road initiative often-
times produces corrupt, elite-centered, 
get-rich-quick debt traps, our program 
is exactly the opposite. It brings trans-
parency to natural resource manage-
ment by engaging civil society, focuses 
on the people who depend on these eco-
systems for food and economic activity 
instead of on elites, fosters sustainable 
development and is debt forgiveness in-
stead of a debt trap. The One Belt One 
Road initiative oftentimes gets these 
countries in a huge debt trap that they 
never get out of, and China benefits in-
stead of the countries that one thinks 
might benefit from One Belt One Road. 
With this program, the State Depart-
ment can showcase the U.S. develop-
ment model and bring real gains in the 
developing world. It is in the interest 
of the whole world to protect tropical 
forests and coral reefs. This program 
does so in a targeted, proven, sustain-
able way, and pays for it by forgiving 
debt we would never have seen repaid 
anyway. 
In my mind, this is a win for the tax-
payer, a win for the developing coun-
tries, a win for America, and a win for 
the whole world. I would urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
I, 
again, 
thank 
BRAD
SHERMAN, 
Democratic congressman from Cali-
fornia, for his cosponsorship and his 
leadership on this. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I will close by say-
ing this is really a good bill. I thank 
Senator ROB PORTMAN also for his lead-
ership on this here in the House, when 
he was here, and then over in the Sen-
ate. We took this up after he left the 
House and have been working on it for 
years. 
I thank Mr. SHERMAN and a lot of Re-
publicans and Democrats for working 
on this together. This is bipartisan leg-
islation that really does benefit the 
whole world. I wish we did more stuff 
like this around here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume for the purpose of clos-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 241, introduced 
by Mr. CHABOT, is a bipartisan bill that 
reauthorizes the Tropical Forest and 
Coral Reef Conservation Act. 
The debt-for-nature swaps created by 
this program have been highly success-
ful in generating support for tropical 
forest or coral reef conservation activi-
ties in exchange for relieving debt 
owed to the United States Government. 
This bill is a win-win, protecting forest 
and coral reef ecosystems, lessening 
the fiscal burden of low-income coun-
tries, and stimulating economic growth 
in local communities. 
I hope my colleagues, both Repub-
lican and Democrat, will join me in 
supporting this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 241. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

April 19, 2021 
HONORING ROBERT LEDER 
(Mr. TORRES of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, Robert Leder, as his name 
would suggest, was a natural leader, 
loved by the thousands of students 
whose lives he lifted. 
I, for one, would not be here were it 
not for Robert Leder, who set me on a 
trajectory that led from public housing 
in the Bronx to the House of Rep-
resentatives in Washington, D.C. My 
story is a mere footnote in the much 
larger legacy of public service that 
Robert Leder left behind after his pass-
ing in 2018. 
Mr. Leder entered public education in 
the 1960s as a Spanish teacher. In the 
late 1970s, he rose to become the prin-
cipal of Herbert H. Lehman High 
School in the Bronx, a position he held 
for nearly three decades, making him, 
at the time, the longest-serving educa-
tor in America’s largest city. As prin-
cipal, he knew the name of every stu-
dent. He held everyone around him to 
the highest standards, but he held him-
self to the highest standard of all. 
We, the alumni of Lehman High 
School, will always love you, Mr. 
Leder. We will never forget you. 
I will not always be a Member of Con-
gress, but I will always be the grateful 
student of the greatest educator I have 
ever known, Robert Leder. May he rest 
in peace.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE WEEK OF THE 
YOUNG CHILD 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the 50th anniversary of the Week 
of the Young Child. Sponsored by the 
National Association for the Education 
of Young Children, the Week of the 
Young Child focuses on celebrating 
early learning, young children, their 
teachers, families, and communities. 
This year’s celebration took place 
from April 10th to the 16th. The Na-
tional Association for the Education of 
Young Children first established the 
Week of the Young Child in 1971, recog-
nizing the early childhood years lay 
the foundation for children’s success in 
school and later in life. 
Children’s earliest years are the most 
important when it comes to shaping 
their learning and development. High- 
quality early care and educational 
services 
directly 
correlate 
to 
the 
health and well-being of our commu-
nities. 
Madam Speaker, with more than 400 
childcare facilities in my district, and 
as a senior member of the Education 
and Labor Committee, I understand the 
importance of quality early care and 
education experiences as well as access 
to high-quality care. 
Madam Speaker, let’s take a moment 
to recognize the vital work performed 
by early childcare and education pro-
fessionals and express our gratitude.

RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AGAINST 
UKRAINE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co- 
chair of the bipartisan Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I rise today with deep 
concern regarding the Kremlin’s in-
creased aggression toward our ally, 
Ukraine. 
Currently, Russia is amassing troops 
in and close to Ukraine. Ukrainian offi-
cials estimate about 80,000 Russian 
troops are amassed on its border. 
U.S. European Command General Tod 
Wolters said, the current Russian force 
mirrors the size of the infiltration of 
forces that occurred back in 2014 when 
Russia illegally invaded Ukrainian ter-
ritory. 
This aggression serves one purpose: 
Russia’s hybrid warfare to threaten the 
security of the Transatlantic Alliance. 
I am so grateful to President Biden 
for his exceptional leadership and sup-
port for Ukraine, and I agree com-
pletely that there must be serious con-
sequences should Russia escalate fur-
ther. I am also thankful for the admin-
istration’s latest round of punitive 
sanctions on Russia given its malign 
behavior. 
To strengthen Ukraine’s deterrence 
capabilities, our caucus spearheaded ef-
forts to increase Ukraine’s defense as-
sistance funding by $25 million, up to 
$275 million in fiscal year 2021, and to 
place mandatory sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2. 
Our caucus stands ready to support 
NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance 
to ensure the protection of Ukraine’s 
sovereignty. 
f 
ENDORSEMENT OF VIOLENCE IS 
UNCONSCIONABLE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise out of great concern for the vio-
lence and looting that has taken over 
Minneapolis. Even more troubling is 
the seeming endorsement and, yes, in-
citement of it by Members of this body. 
It is unconscionable that a Member 
of Congress sent to Washington to 
make the laws that govern our Nation 
would encourage Americans to dis-
regard those laws. Yet one of our 
Democratic colleagues, only one day 
after 136 rioters were arrested, called 
for protesters to ‘‘stay on the street,’’ 
‘‘get more active,’’ and ‘‘get more 
confrontational’’ against our law en-
forcement, urging this escalation by 
asking protesters to ignore the city-
wide curfew. Hours later, that inevi-
table escalation did occur, with Na-
tional Guardsmen and police being 
fired upon. 
These are very dangerous actions. Is 
this the standard by which we want 
this House to represent the people of 
this country, that incitement? I recall 
a lot of talk some months ago about a 
much lesser speech being inciteful, lan-
guage must less geared toward that 
being inciteful, yet it happens here. 
Strong action needs to be taken by 
Speaker PELOSI and this House against 
these types of words.

SECURITY ON THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight to discuss one of the most 
important problems facing our coun-
try, and that is security on our south-
ern border. 
I don’t think there is any question 
that most Americans agree that our 
immigration system is broken, but be-
fore we can fix it, we have to address 
the crisis at our southern border. 
And let’s be clear, what is happening 
at the border is a crisis. In fact, the 
President admitted as much recently. 
His commander of Public Health Serv-
ice at the convention center in Dallas, 
when I went to visit there, maintained 
that they were in crisis management. 
You don’t manage a crisis unless you 
are in a crisis, so it is a crisis. It is a 
humanitarian crisis. 
The policies being put forward by 
this administration, basically abso-
lutely opening the border are, in fact, 
inhumane. Smugglers, traffickers, for-
eign banks are profiting and enticing a 
hopeless people into sending their chil-
dren or themselves to make this dan-
gerous journey to unlawfully cross our 
southern border. These bad actors 
know how to manipulate our laws to 
their advantage. Putting forward poli-
cies that make it easier for them to do 
so is, in fact, wrong. 
During the month of March record 
numbers of unaccompanied alien chil-
dren were referred to the Office of Ref-
ugee Resettlement at the Department 
of Health and Human Services. The 
total number of people coming in with-
out authorization is the highest it has 
been in 15 years. Customs and Border 
Protection encountered over 170,000 in-
dividuals along our southern border at-
tempting to cross without authoriza-
tion. Many of them were single adults. 
Over the last month, Members from 
both sides of the aisle, both sides of the 
Capitol flocked to our southern border 
to see and assess the situation for

themselves. 
They 
held 
press 
con-
ferences. They did television inter-
views and press releases. Yet the reac-
tion from the White House was one of 
denial. 
A little less than 30 days ago Presi-
dent Biden named Vice President HAR-
RIS to be the point person for the ad-
ministration to bring a resolution to 
the problems on our southern border. 
But the Vice President has not ven-
tured to the southern border. She has 
not had a press conference about what 
is happening, and certainly we have 
seen no plan. 
It was announced last week that she 
would be traveling to the Northern Tri-
angle countries of El Salvador, Guate-
mala, and Honduras. This would be a 
great first step. But to fully under-
stand what is happening, Madam Vice 
President, you need to visit our south-
ern border. 
Right now, hundreds of thousands of 
people come across our southern border 
from Mexico and from Central Amer-
ican countries through Mexico. And 
among these thousands are unaccom-
panied children, who are used as pawns 
to take advantage of the administra-
tion not enforcing our immigration 
laws. Now smugglers have no issue 
with using these children as pawns. 
From the numbers, we know that 
America is one of the most generous 
countries in the world when it comes 
to accepting migrants. Through our 
Nation’s legal immigration process, we 
welcome over a million immigrants 
into America each year. To be clear, 
these are immigrants who are going 
through the normal and correct proc-
ess, waiting in line and following our 
laws. But how discouraging must it be 
for them to watch as others take full 
advantage of our laws not being en-
forced because of Washington putting 
forward poor policy. Despite the gen-
erosity of the American people, others 
remain intent on entering our country 
without the full benefit of the law be-
hind them. 
To better understand this problem, it 
is perhaps important to examine its 
roots. In 2018 it was important for me 
to visit Northern Triangle countries 
for myself to see the situation on the 
ground, to assess the situation, and de-
termine how the United States can bet-
ter help and better address the root 
causes of irregular migration. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, which I am a member of, does 
not oversee foreign policy, but it does 
have jurisdiction over the Department 
of Health and Human Services and sub-
sequently the Office of Refugee Reset-
tlement, which does take care of chil-
dren who end up in the United States 
from one of those Northern Triangle 
countries. 
I learned that there are different 
drivers for people to migrate from each 
of those countries. There is, unfortu-
nately, corruption at the highest levels 
of government in that region. One com-
mon theme, however, is campaign rhet-
oric that places an ‘‘open for business’’ 
sign on our border. 
The vast majority of people in the 
Northern Triangle countries do live 
below the poverty level and lack the 
job opportunities to escape these condi-
tions. 
In El Salvador there are problems 
with gangs, and the gangs are violent, 
medieval levels of violence and bru-
tality. Many of the individuals serving 
in their government are holdovers from 
revolutionaries in the civil war which 
ended over 20 years ago. 
Honduras is a country that is a 
through point for narcotics trafficking 
and, as a consequence, has many of the 
problems 
that 
you 
would 
imagine 
would be attendant with that type of 
activity. The current President ran for 
a second term. Although the law lim-
ited him to a single term the Supreme 
Court gave him a favorable decision. 
Unfortunately, he won with a very bare 
majority that only was determined 
many days after, some significant time 
after the election. Stop me if you have 
ever heard this before. But the Hon-
duran President is now subject to ex-
tensive protests throughout his coun-
try that question the legitimacy of his 
Presidency. 
I will say that the First Lady of Hon-
duras, who has headed a task force 
aimed at addressing irregular migra-
tion, is performing a valuable service. 
The desire to make change is present, 
but some of the resources and capacity 
are lacking. 
In Guatemala corruption is rampant 
at every level of government. There are 
only a couple of ministers who can be 
trusted. The corruption is, in this case, 
exacerbated by term limits because the 
President can only serve one term, and 
apparently there is a notion in the 
country that it is important for the 
President to prepare for the life after 
the Presidency while they are in office, 
so they do not have their focus on per-
forming in the public good. 
There is also a significant prejudice 
against some of the indigenous people 
in the western highlands of Guatemala. 
These individuals do make up the ma-
jority of migrants who are leaving 
Guatemala. Guatemala, unfortunately, 
has one of the highest rates of mal-
nutrition in the world, and there is 
very little effort to combat this be-
cause of the lack of resolve of their 
central government. 
In my travels to the Northern Tri-
angle, I learned that there are people 
in those countries who do desire their 
children stay home. They understand 
the difficulty, the danger in exporting 
all of your young people. They do not 
want irregular migration. They do not 
want mass migration to happen. How-
ever, unfortunately, their governments 
have yet to eradicate the corruption 
from within. 
For example, they do not prohibit fi-
nancial institutions from contributing 
to the problem of these desperate popu-
lations. The financing of human traf-
ficking from these countries is ex-
tremely profitable. Beyond the danger 
to the migrant, the journey from the 
Northern Triangle to our southern bor-
der is not cheap. It varies what the es-
timates are, but families take out 
loans from $1,000 to $10,000 in order to 
smuggle someone to the United States. 
Children that enter the United States 
will sometimes go to work to send re-
mittances back to their homes so that 
their family is able to pay off the loan. 
In fact, it is estimated that as much as 
20 percent of the GDP of Honduras 
comes in the form of remittances, so it 
is disturbing to learn that legitimate 
banks in Northern Triangle countries 
may be in this way aiding the human 
smuggling trade. It does seem like it is 
being fueled by cash from sources from 
which it should not come. 
b 2015 
One clear solution to the corruption 
of these countries is to give more aid 
to the Bureau of International Nar-
cotics Control and Law Enforcement, a 
United 
Nations 
organization; 
non-
governmental organizations and non-
profits; the United States Agency for 
International 
Development, 
USAID; 
the International Organization for Mi-
gration; and other nongovernmental 
entities. 
In addition, the United States Devel-
opment 
Finance 
Corporation, 
pre-
viously known as the Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation, is facilitating 
needed investment in the region, and 
numerous nonprofits and NGOs have 
set up programs to help poverty-strick-
en and recent returnees. 
One of my fears is what you hear dis-
cussed. Increasing the amount of aid to 
Central American countries will help 
with this problem. I would simply 
argue that the money not necessarily 
go to the governments that are not 
doing their jobs but to these non-
governmental agencies, USAID, and 
the U.S. Development Finance Cor-
poration, which will provide the eco-
nomic benefit needed by the people 
who find it necessary to undergo that 
irregular migration because their eco-
nomic circumstances are so dire. 
In other words, the governments are 
not the ones that need the aid. The aid 
needs to be placed in the hands of those 
who can and will help the people. The 
answer to this humanitarian crisis is 
to not give more aid to the govern-
ments of the countries that are failing 
but to keep supporting the community- 
building organizations that are on the 
ground and working to serve their peo-
ple. 
In line with this solution, in Sep-
tember 2018, I introduced H. Res. 1092, 
expressing the sense of the House that 
the President should redirect foreign 
assistance given to El Salvador, Guate-
mala, and Honduras away from their 
central governments and toward the 
driving causes of illegal immigration 
into the United States and to those 
nongovernmental organizations. I have 
reintroduced this as H. Res. 17 in this 
Congress. 
The inability of the central govern-
ments of those countries to deal with

and solve these issues has left over half 
of their populations living in poverty. 
In fact, millions of El Salvadorans, 
Guatemalans, and Hondurans face hun-
ger at points each year. 
This is why foreign assistance must 
be targeted toward the municipal and 
regional governments in these coun-
tries, as well as community-building 
organizations that have a direct im-
pact on the lives of the people. Simply 
giving more aid to the central govern-
ments when it is not getting to where 
it is needed is unlikely to solve the 
problem. 
The amount of foreign assistance 
could be determined by multiplying 
the number of unaccompanied alien 
children from El Salvador, Guatemala, 
and Honduras and redirecting that 
amount for each country to these non-
central government entities. 
Focusing on where aid is directed is 
an essential part of the solution. That 
is why, in December 2018, I offered an 
amendment to the Department of De-
fense Appropriations Act to redirect 
foreign aid to nongovernmental organi-
zations in Northern Triangle countries 
and Mexico from being given to the 
central governments. 
Instead, this funding would only be 
given to regional or municipal govern-
ments or educational institutions in 
these countries, private entities, or 
other nongovernmental organizations, 
or faith-based organizations operating 
in these countries. 
To keep individuals, particularly un-
accompanied alien children, from ar-
riving at our southern border, the help 
necessary to make their homes safer 
and more prosperous is not through 
their central governments but for in-
stitution-building and other areas that 
can provide them the help they need to 
show that we are serious and to dem-
onstrate to the central governments of 
the Northern Triangle countries that 
the United States cannot be constant 
caretakers for their children. 
To that end, I have introduced sev-
eral times the Unaccompanied Alien 
Children Assistance Control Act to 
withhold aid from El Salvador, Guate-
mala, and Honduras by the number of 
children in Federal custody due to 
their immigration status, multiplied 
by a multiplier, which is the estimated 
cost of caring for one unaccompanied 
alien child. 
We should not be surprised that the 
reversal of the previous administra-
tion’s immigration policies led to an 
influx of unlawful crossings at our 
southern borders. I would take issue 
with the fact that this is said to be a 
cyclical uptick. Yes, there are cyclical 
variations to the number of people who 
do cross our southern border, but this 
one is not a cyclical uptick. This influx 
is a direct result of a policy choice 
made by the Biden administration. 
We faced a similar crisis in 2014, 
when President Biden was Vice Presi-
dent, and President Obama’s adminis-
tration instituted the dangerous catch 
and release policy that led to a flood of 
unauthorized migrants and unaccom-
panied 
minors 
coming 
across 
our 
southern border. Instead of keeping 
those who made unauthorized crossings 
in custody, our immigration and en-
forcement agencies were required to re-
lease those individuals into our coun-
try. 
People were given a court date, but 
few, if any, would actually appear. Be-
yond missing a court date, unauthor-
ized migrants took advantage of our 
system. Unfortunately, the diversion of 
so many people coming across the bor-
der, the diversion of the attention of 
our law enforcement officials on the 
border, has allowed for the free impor-
tation of drugs like fentanyl and her-
oin across our border. 
Due to those failures, it is under-
standable why the previous administra-
tion instituted a policy that required 
the enforcement of our laws. For 4 
years, we listened to Members of Con-
gress have these discussions on the bor-
der and in the Halls of Congress about 
the misfortune of those who crossed 
into our country without the benefit of 
citizenship. 
But what exactly does it mean to put 
forward a zero-tolerance policy? It 
means enforcing the laws and giving 
needed support to our frontline border 
officials. 
No one wants to see a child separated 
from their parents. This is a problem 
that Congress needs to fix. It is a prob-
lem that Congress can fix. 
To understand why this has hap-
pened, we look back to the court case 
of Reno v. Flores in 1997, and we look 
at the asylum laws that were passed in 
late 2008. 
The Flores settlement prohibited the 
detention of children from a noncontig-
uous country for more than 20 days. 
After those 20 days, they are placed in 
the care of the Office of Refugee Reset-
tlement if they cannot be reunited 
with family. 
Previously, when adults attempted to 
cross into the United States without 
authorization, they were placed in im-
migration detention to await an immi-
gration hearing. But due to the back-
log of immigration cases, these adults 
were being held longer than 20 days. If 
they entered with a child, the Flores 
settlement required that the child be 
released. Therefore, the adults were 
also being released with them, and very 
few ever showed up for their immigra-
tion proceedings. 
It changed during the Trump admin-
istration. 
They 
held 
unauthorized 
adults rather than releasing them. And 
if they entered with children, those 
children were placed in the care of the 
Office of Refugee Resettlement. 
People claimed this was inhumane. If 
enforcing our laws is inhumane, then 
we need to change the law. But it 
seems 
like 
what 
is 
inhumane 
is 
incentivizing an already desperate peo-
ple to make the dangerous journey to 
our southern border. To do that in the 
first place seems inhumane. 
We must realize that far too many 
children are being smuggled into our 
country by adults who want to prey on 
the generosity of Americans. A signifi-
cant number of adults with children 
are not even biological relatives to the 
child with whom they enter. Traf-
fickers, cartels, and smugglers know 
how to take advantage of a humani-
tarian crisis. 
Being a father and a grandfather, I 
truly mean it when I say that no one 
wants to separate a child from their 
parents. That is why, on September 25, 
during the Rules Committee hearing, I 
offered an amendment requiring a plan 
to promptly reunify children in the 
custody of the Office of Refugee Reset-
tlement. 
It is not inhumane to enforce laws. 
Putting forth policies that allow chil-
dren to be used as pawns is itself inhu-
mane. Trekking a child across multiple 
countries just to smuggle them ille-
gally into another country, that is in-
humane. 
Stated another way, our laws are not 
inhumane; nonenforcement is leading 
to inhumane actions by desperate peo-
ple. We need to help them at home, not 
here where the taxpayer is on the 
hook. 
For anyone who turns on the news, 
you can see the terrible and disheart-
ening situation at the border. So, 
today, the question is asked: Why 
would anyone object to enforcement of 
our laws? 
There is significant proof that a zero- 
tolerance policy for violating our laws 
is a deterrent for people subjecting 
themselves to harm by taking a per-
ilous trip to the American southern 
border. 
For example, in early 2017, Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Secretary 
John Kelly visited the southern border. 
It was virtually deserted. In June 2017, 
a Reuters journalist, Julia Edwards 
Ainsley, reported on the decreased 
number of border crossings. She wrote: 
‘‘Last fall, during the waning months 
of the Obama administration, hundreds 
of immigrants crossed the river on 
rafts at this point each day, many will-
ingly handing themselves over to im-
migration authorities in hopes of being 
released into the United States to 
await court proceedings that would de-
cide their fate. 
‘‘Now, the agents look out on an 
empty landscape. Footpaths up from 
the water have started to disappear 
under growing brush, with only the 
stray baby shoe or toothbrush serving 
as reminders of that migrant flood. 
‘‘The reason for the change, the 
agents say, is a perception in Mexico 
and Central America that President 
Trump has ended the practice known 
as catch and release, in which immi-
grants caught in the United States 
without proper documents were re-
leased to live free, often for years, as 
their cases ran through the court sys-
tem. 
‘‘Now, would-be violators know ‘they 
will be detained and turned right back 
around,’ said one of the two agents, 
Marlene Castro. ‘It is not worth it any-
more.’ ’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1950 
April 19, 2021 
So said Julia Edwards Ainsley in 
June 2017. 
What happened between the Obama 
years and the first years of the Trump 
administration? When people believe 
that they will encounter a border wall, 
or that they will be turned away at the 
border, they simply do not come. 
Our laws are only effective if they 
are enforced. If Congress truly wants to 
repair our immigration system, we, the 
Members of Congress, are obligated to 
act. 
We know this is not the first time in 
American history that an administra-
tion has used a zero-tolerance policy. 
Over 40 years ago, during the Carter 
administration, between April 15 and 
October 31, 1980, there was a mass emi-
gration of Cubans. They left from 
Cuba’s Mariel Harbor to travel to the 
United States. We remember this as 
the Mariel boatlift. Because of this 
emigration, Fidel Castro decided to 
open his prisons and mental health fa-
cilities, sending those Cubans through 
the Straits of Florida to the United 
States. President Carter’s administra-
tion was left grappling with a Cuban 
refugee crisis. 
In a 1997 interview, former Deputy 
Secretary of State John Bushnell re-
called a meeting with President Carter 
in which he and other key advisers dis-
cussed solutions to the Cuban refugee 
problem: 
I remember sitting in that windowless con-
ference room of the National Security Coun-
cil with the Secretary of State, the Chief of 
Naval Operations, the Director of the CIA, 
the head of the Coast Guard, the head of INS, 
and several other senior officials, debating 
how to stop this flow of Cubans. National Se-
curity Advisor Brzezinski chaired until Car-
ter came in toward the end of the meeting. 
There was a long discussion on how the 
Coast Guard and Navy ships might phys-
ically stop the Cuban boats either from leav-
ing the United States or returning back with 
the Cubans in the Mariel Boatlift. The Navy 
and Coast Guard, represented at this meet-
ing by admirals, were concerned. 
‘‘How can we do this?’’ they said, and it 
was suggested that the boats simply could be 
stopped, physically prevented from entering 
the United States, without any major loss of 
life of the passengers. But they did suggest 
ways of maneuvering the boats to block 
their passage, which struck me as sort of 
wild. It sounded to me like they had in mind 
a picket line of Coast Guard and Navy boats 
going across the Straits of Florida to stop 
the movement of these small boats with ref-
ugees. This naval discussion went on for a 
long time but eventually was inconclusive. 
Perhaps wisely so. 
But from this interview, we under-
stand that President Carter’s adminis-
tration was contemplating how to 
physically stop Cuban boats from com-
ing to the United States. 
Then, moving forward to the early 
1990s, rafts of immigrants from Haiti 
bound for the United States were inter-
cepted at sea, as authorized by policy 
enacted by President Bush’s adminis-
tration. 
b 2030 
A young governor from Arkansas 
used divisive campaign rhetoric as he 
ran against George H.W. Bush for 
President. Then-Governor Clinton time 
and again spoke of his disagreement 
with President Bush’s zero-tolerance 
immigration policy. 
During his campaign, Governor Clin-
ton often maligned President Bush for 
being cruel in the treatment of Haitian 
refugees traveling to America via boat. 
Some feared that he was creating an 
unrealistic expectation for the Haitian 
people, who were suffering from signifi-
cant unrest in their country. 
In the New York Times, an article 
entitled, ‘‘Clinton Inspires Hope and 
Fear in Haiti,’’ a writer, Douglas 
Farah, wrote: ‘‘It was Mr. Clinton who 
helped create the expectation of an ex-
odus from Haiti when he condemned 
the Bush administration for a ‘cruel 
policy of returning Haitian refugees to 
a brutal dictatorship without an asy-
lum hearing.’’’ 
We all know from our history in No-
vember of 1992, Governor Clinton won 
the Presidential election. Because of 
President-elect Clinton’s promises, the 
people of Haiti anticipated being wel-
comed into the United States with 
open arms. The problem is, after secur-
ing the White House, President Clinton 
changed his mind after learning that 
perhaps the true toll such an exodus 
would take as people took to the 
waters in unseaworthy boats. 
In a Voice of America address on 
January 14, 1993—a mere week before 
he took the oath of office—President- 
elect Clinton walked back his promise. 
Let me just read some of President- 
elect Clinton’s remarks that he spoke 
directly to the people of Haiti over the 
Voice of America. 
‘‘For Haitians who do seek to leave 
Haiti, boat departure is a terrible and 
dangerous choice. I’ve been deeply con-
cerned by reports that many of you are 
preparing to travel by boat to the 
United States. And, I fear that boat de-
partures in the near future would re-
sult in further tragic losses of life. 
‘‘For this reason, the practice of re-
turning those who flee Haiti by boat 
will continue for the time being after I 
become President. Those who do leave 
Haiti for the United States by boat will 
be stopped and directly returned by the 
United States Coast Guard. 
‘‘To avoid the human tragedy of a 
boat exodus, I wanted to convey this 
message directly to the Haitian people: 
Leaving by boat is not the route to 
freedom.’’ 
Well, as you can imagine, this dra-
matic change did not go without no-
tice. January 17, 1993, the Chicago 
Tribune columnist Stephen Chapman 
wrote: ‘‘The President-elect has a ter-
rible time making up his mind and 
keeping it made up. A lot of Haitians 
are disappointed to find he’s something 
less than a man of his word. They’re 
not the only ones.’’ 
So just from these historical mo-
ments, we can understand that border 
security is not a new debate; it is not 
an 
easy 
debate. 
President 
Carter, 
President Clinton, President Obama, 
all learned the same lesson. It is, in 
fact, inhumane to encourage anyone to 
attempt a treacherous journey in order 
to reach America’s borders without the 
proper authorization to enter. 
There are things we must prioritize 
to move forward. First, having the un-
derstanding that enforcing our laws is, 
in fact, a humanitarian response. 
The next step would be security 
along the southern border. To put it 
plain and simple: We can finish the 
wall, which includes having not just 
the wall, but additional technologies to 
solve the problem. 
In order to solve problems within our 
broken immigration system, the bleed-
ing needs to stop. You can’t put a 
Band-Aid on an arterial wound. You 
need to stop the bleeding. Congress 
first needs to address the humanitarian 
crisis at our southern border. 
So it was encouraging to hear Sec-
retary Mayorkas announce a reconsid-
eration of filling the gaps in the con-
struction on the southern border wall. 
I recently took a trip down to McAllen. 
Between McAllen and Laredo, you can 
see areas where the wall was being 
built. The construction had stopped. 
The construction equipment was lit-
erally abandoned at the side, but I was 
grateful that Secretary Mayorkas did 
say that he was reconsidering filling in 
the gaps in the construction in the 
southern border wall. The problem is 
the smugglers know where those gaps 
are. They know how to use them to 
their advantage. 
Again, let me say, when it comes to 
immigration, America is the most gen-
erous country in the world. But is it 
okay for us to allow over 100,000 people 
a month to enter our country without 
authorization? Is it all right for us to 
subject innocent children to a dan-
gerous journey? 
Sovereign countries must define and 
defend their borders. I believe that 
America is a country worth defending. 
It is heartbreaking that after achieving 
operational control of the border after 
many years, it was abandoned. It was 
abandoned through a series of execu-
tive orders that was signed early in 
this President’s administration. And 
what has happened in its place, oper-
ational control of the border is no 
longer determined by the United States 
of America. Operational control of the 
border is now determined and dictated 
by cartels. 
This week, we are considering two 
immigration bills: the NO BAN Act and 
the Access to Counsel Act. The first 
will prevent the President from ban-
ning anyone from entering the United 
States. The second essentially provides 
a lawyer to anyone entering our coun-
try unlawfully, thus prolonging the 
wait times for those who are trying to 
enter our country through the normal 
legal process. And that all will be done 
at the taxpayer’s expense. 
Clearly, these are the wrong solu-
tions at this time. Our priority should 
be to ensure that every President has 
the necessary tools to put forward law-
ful priorities and not prevent them

April 19, 2021 
from doing so. We should be focused on 
policies that will encourage legal im-
migration rather than just reacting to 
illegal immigration. 
It is important that we reinstate the 
‘‘Remain 
in 
Mexico 
Policy,’’ 
also 
known as the Migrant Protection Pro-
tocols. We know this program helped 
limit fraudulent asylum claims from 
those who thought they would be able 
to just walk into the United States, 
and instead had to wait their turn for 
a hearing while remaining in Mexico. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
good 
idea 
to 
allow 
lawbreakers to jump in front of those 
who are here lawfully. 
We are still in the middle of a pan-
demic. Now, thankfully, the Biden ad-
ministration has kept the Trump ad-
ministration’s CDC Title 42 authority 
in place—oh, except for people younger 
than 17 years of age. We are on the 
verge of ending the pandemic, but we 
must ensure that we are doing every-
thing we can to prevent additional 
spread of this coronavirus. Something 
that would aid in doing that is requir-
ing a negative coronavirus test before 
someone is released into this country. 
What happened when, under an exec-
utive order, the Title 42 restrictions 
were lifted for those under 17? A lot 
more people under age 17 started com-
ing through, started coming across. 
The problem is, each of those individ-
uals will eventually be placed with a 
family, 
and 
by 
not 
testing 
for 
coronavirus, we are risking placing in-
dividuals who are infected with the 
virus with families throughout the 
country. 
So during consideration of the rec-
onciliation bill, the one that was sup-
posed to crush the coronavirus, I of-
fered a motion to instruct at the Budg-
et Committee and an amendment at 
the Committee on Rules to provide for 
COVID testing for all arriving at our 
southern border. This was rejected in 
the Budget Committee, and the Com-
mittee on Rules would not make it in 
order to have a floor vote on that 
amendment. 
And once migrants are in our Federal 
custody, we do have responsibility that 
they receive appropriate and compas-
sionate care. Under the jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce Subcommittee on Health, we 
have conducted oversight on the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices and the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment. 
Since 2014, I have made multiple trips 
to the border and multiple trips to 
ORR facilities. In the last few weeks, I 
visited Office of Refugee Resettlement 
shelters in Carrizo Springs, in McAllen 
and the convention center in downtown 
Dallas. Since my visit to the Carrizo 
Springs facility, it has been doubled in 
size. There are so few beds at ORR shel-
ters along the border, there has been a 
need to expand further, which is why I 
visited the Kay Bailey Hutchison Con-
vention Center in Dallas. 
It was startling to see those 2,400 cots 
lined up each to allow a 13- to 17-year- 
old boy to sleep at night. They were so 
close together, any restaurant that 
tried to open right now with tables 
placed that close together would be 
shut down by the public health au-
thorities. And yet, here we were, in 
fact not just condoning it, we were fa-
cilitating it. 
Look, the bottom line is, this is not 
a capacity problem, it is a commit-
ment problem. And we are, unfortu-
nately, on a path to repeat history. 
Many of us here know the work done 
by the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce Subcommittee on Health in 2014. 
That work led to the unaccompanied 
minors 
receiving 
better 
health 
screenings, and better healthcare. 
When I visited shelters in 2014, the 
children did not have access to a doc-
tor. They were not receiving any type 
of health screening. Today, they have 
access to a full range of medical and 
mental health resources and children 
are being screened for communicable 
diseases, children are being given vac-
cinations for the usual childhood dis-
eases prior to their release to sponsors 
in this country. It makes sense to do 
that. This protects American commu-
nities; this protects American schools, 
where these children will eventually be 
enrolled. 
Today, when a child is released from 
an ORR facility, they have a phone 
number to contact the Department of 
Health and Human Services after they 
leave their shelter. And they will also 
receive a wellness check 30 days after 
their release to a sponsor. 
In 2014, it wasn’t that way, children 
were not given any means of contact 
after they left Federal custody, and no 
follow up was conducted. And unfortu-
nately, you know what is going to hap-
pen in that situation. Some children 
will not be placed with a competent 
caregiver, and they can fall victim to 
trafficking or abuse. 
Now, because of Members of the sub-
committee and Members of the full 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
if children need help once they leave 
the shelter, they do have a lifeline. 
These are helpful resources for those 
who are entrusted to Federal care. My 
primary goal is to secure the border 
and to prevent unaccompanied minors 
from crossing the United States with-
out benefit of citizenship in the first 
place. But while it is happening, we 
must do our best to ensure that they 
are safe after they arrive. 
I understand the care of children is a 
huge balancing act. Once they are in 
our care, it becomes our responsibility, 
and we must ensure that those trav-
eling with them are not using them to 
game our immigration system. It is 
simply wrong and potentially harmful 
to the child, not to check that the 
adult with which they are traveling is, 
in fact, related or their legal guardian. 
Ultimately, we will have to put an 
end to this crisis. From our experi-
ences, both recent and throughout his-
tory, we know that our rhetoric mat-
ters. The message must be clear: Do 
not cross the border unlawfully. For 
years, Presidents, Senators, Represent-
atives, have promised to end ‘‘catch- 
and-release’’ and restore order on the 
southern border. 
The human traffickers, the coyotes 
in Central America, use our words spo-
ken in Washington, D.C. They use our 
words to prey on the disadvantaged in 
Central American countries to entice 
families into putting their children on 
the top of a freight train to travel 
through the Mexican desert. And they 
do that by putting a price on the head 
of each child. They use our words to 
subject children to the violence of car-
tels, or worse, children who may not 
arrive in the United States after begin-
ning that journey. 
b 2045 
When we say, or even suggest, that 
children could receive amnesty at the 
border, we put innocent lives at risk. 
Our words turn these children into lit-
eral game pieces. We can be compas-
sionate and we can provide a secure 
border at the same time. These two 
concepts are not mutually exclusive. 
In 1980, as former Deputy Secretary 
of State Bushnell recalled, Congress 
appropriated over $400 million to assist 
holding and settling Cuban refugees in 
the United States. 
And reflecting on that time, later, 
former 
Deputy 
Secretary 
Bushnell 
said, ‘‘I used this appropriation as a 
key 
example 
of 
why 
foreign 
aid 
through the Caribbean Group was a 
good investment. It was much better to 
help our neighbors build a good eco-
nomic future for themselves at home 
than to have a flood of desperate refu-
gees, which would cost more money to 
settle.’’ 
I think, today, it would be wise to 
consider 
Secretary 
Bushnell’s 
rea-
soning. Perhaps Congress could heed 
my recommendation to address how we 
send foreign aid to countries such as El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and 
Mexico. 
Should it be tied to the care that 
their children receive? 
Here is the deal: Why should we re-
ward countries whose children are flee-
ing for their safety to our country? 
Certainly, it is something worth con-
sideration. 
It is simply irresponsible and it is in-
humane for the American Government 
to incentivize anyone to subject them-
selves or their children to that perilous 
journey on our border. It was a lesson 
that President Clinton learned. It was 
a lesson that President Carter learned. 
It was a lesson that President Obama 
learned. And I do fear that it is a les-
son that President Biden will learn. 
We know the solution. We do know 
what works. Simply put, enforcement 
of Title 42 protections for all age 
groups, not accepting those younger 
than 17. Accept enforcement of Title 42, 
the CDC requirement that, during a 
pandemic, we restrict travel across the 
border.

skill, these cooperative agreements 
were established, but, unfortunately, 
they have recently been abandoned. 
They could be reconsidered. They could 
be reestablished. We are going to have 
to have agreements with the countries 
of origin around asylum if we are going 
to be able to solve the problem. 
The Migrant Protection Protocol, 
‘‘Remain in Mexico,’’ was successful. It 
did help in the assessment of the Asy-
lum 
Cooperative 
Agreements. 
This 
could be reinstituted, and it is prob-
ably time that it was. 
In fact, it is past time to end a bro-
ken and inhumane pattern. It is past 
time to stop demonizing those who we 
ask to enforce our laws. It is past time 
to understand that nonenforcement of 
our laws does lead to inhumane ac-
tions. 
It is up to Congress. We are the legis-
lative branch. We are the ones under 
the Constitution who are responsible 
for providing this security at our bor-
der. What is so critically important is 
that we must do it sooner rather than 
later. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our strength, rock, and for-
tress, we praise Your holy Name. 
Thank You for being our shield and 
stronghold. 
Today, give our lawmakers the wis-
dom to seek You, for You deserve their 
trust. As our Senators remember how 
You have sustained our Nation in the 
past, may they have confidence in Your 
guidance for the future. 
Lord, remind them of the times they 
cried to You for help, and You an-
swered them through Your loving prov-
idence. As they recall that when You 
speak, good things happen, empower 
them to face whatever the future 
brings without fear. Use them to speak 
lifegiving words that bring harmony 
and hope. 
We pray in Your marvelous Name. 
Amen.

f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate returns this week with a 
full plate. Today, we will continue to 
work on two important nominations to 
the Justice Department: Lisa Monaco 
and Vanita Gupta. Both should be con-
firmed by the end of this week. The 
Senate will also vote to confirm SEC 
Commissioner Gary Gensler to a full 
term. 
At the same time, the Senate will 
continue to work on the anti-Asian 
hate crimes bill. Last week, the Senate 
voted to proceed with the legislation 
by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 
92 to 6. The process will continue to be 
bipartisan. 
Senator COLLINS
has worked with 
Senator HIRONO—you, Madam Presi-
dent—on a few modifications, which we 
have welcomed. Senators MORAN and 
BLUMENTHAL have worked with Senator 
SCOTT
of Florida to incorporate his 
feedback into their legislation called 
the NO HATE Act, which would im-
prove and strengthen the bill. 
Senator WARNOCK has worked with 
Senators HIRONO and COLLINS to in-
clude language acknowledging the re-
cent tragic shootings near Atlanta. 
All of these ideas will be incor-
porated into a broader final substitute 
amendment. I will ensure the Senate 
votes on the substitute amendment in 
the coming days. All told, the Senate is 
on track to finish this bill later this 
week. 
We are seeing that when the Senate 
is given the opportunity to work, the 
Senate can work. Members from both 
sides of the aisle have worked together 
over the past week to consider, perfect, 
and—soon—enact legislation respond-
ing to a pressing issue. 
Regrettably—very regrettably—in re-
cent years, all of us have witnessed a 
surge of White nationalism and violent 
extremism in American society. Sen-
ators of good will from both sides of 
the aisle have taken note and devel-
oped proposals to give Federal law en-
forcement officials the tools to better 
detect, prevent, and prosecute this 
surge in hate crimes. 
The Senate will incorporate many of 
these ideas in the final substitute 
amendment to this bill. As a result, I 
am optimistic we can finish our work 
on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill later 
this week in the same manner we start-
ed, with an overwhelming bipartisan 
vote. 
And, let me say, it is needed. As I go 
through New York—I have been to sev-
eral more rallies, one early this morn-
ing—anti-Asian hate crime, unfortu-
nately, is on the upsurge. We hear 
about the violent acts. We have heard 
about the deaths. But, every day, thou-
sands—thousands—of Asian Americans 
are subjected to smaller but nonethe-
less stinging acts of hate crime by 
being called names, by being spat upon, 
by being cursed at, and even just by 
being stared at in a nasty way like: 
Who the heck are you?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2002 
April 19, 2021 
So we must act. We must act both to 
strengthen the Department of Justice’s 
ability to prosecute more hate crimes 
and to pay attention to hate crimes 
and to calculate their number, but also 
to send a message—two messages, in 
fact: 
one 
to 
our 
Asian-American 
friends—a great 6 percent of America 
and 10 percent of New York is Asian 
American—that you are us, we are all 
Americans together, and we welcome 
you being here. I, for one, like you, 
Madam President, would welcome more 
Asian immigrants coming to America. 
But second is a message to those who 
perpetrate these awful acts: You are 
not American. We despise what you do, 
and we are going to remain vigilant 
until this kind of bigotry is diminished 
and maybe even snuffed out. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another matter, for the last year, the 
country has faced a daunting series of 
crises. After such a difficult year, it is 
important to take stock of how the 
country is finally, finally starting to 
recover. 
Over a month ago, Senate Democrats 
passed the American Rescue Plan, su-
percharging our Nation’s vaccination 
drive and putting thousands of dollars 
into the pockets of Americans who 
needed it most. Already, the benefits 
are pouring in. 
Yesterday, the CDC announced that 
the country had reached a truly re-
markable milestone. Over half of U.S. 
adults, 130 million Americans, have re-
ceived at least one dose of the COVID– 
19 vaccine. It is the result of a rapidly 
accelerating 
pace 
of 
distribution, 
which we in the Senate—many of us— 
pushed for, first in the December bill 
and then in the ARP bill. The country 
now averages over 3 million doses per 
day. 
Even better news arrived this morn-
ing. Starting today, every single adult 
in the United States is eligible to get 
vaccinated. Let me say that again. All 
U.S. adults in all 50 States, Wash-
ington, DC, and Puerto Rico are now 
eligible to get the vaccine, meeting the 
deadline President Biden set just 2 
weeks ago. 
I urge all Americans to go online, 
find a location where vaccines are 
being administered, and get the vac-
cine. Register, sign up, call in. Do 
whatever you need to do to make your-
self an appointment. This is about pro-
tecting yourself and protecting your 
family. We are on our way to beating 
COVID–19, but everyone needs to do 
their part, and part of doing your part 
is being vaccinated. 
Inoculating a country of 330 million 
people—a country the size of a con-
tinent—is a momentous task. The fact 
that we have already reached the half-
way point in 4 short months is a credit 
to the Biden administration and our 
work here in Congress to fund vaccine 
production and distribution, and it is a 
credit to the thousands of medical re-
searchers, scientists, doctors, nurses, 
and all the public health workers who 
have made this possible. 
Thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan, our economy has gotten its own 
shot in the arm. The Treasury Depart-
ment announced that nearly 159 mil-
lion stimulus payments—$376 billion— 
have reached people across the coun-
try. Last week, jobless claims fell to 
their lowest levels since the start of 
the pandemic. Global consumer con-
fidence is now higher than it was even 
before the pandemic. Across the coun-
try, the American Rescue Plan is accel-
erating our economic recovery. Con-
sumer spending is up, businesses are 
gradually reopening, and American 
workers are regaining hope and reen-
tering the workforce. 
Thanks to our historic investment in 
American workers, American families, 
and the American economy, brighter 
days are just around the corner. All of 
us who worked hard on passing the 
ARP and the previous legislation can 
be very proud of what we were able to 
do. Now, of course, we are not com-
pletely out of the woods yet. Despite 
the roaring success of the American 
Rescue Plan, we must continue to bol-
ster our economic recovery and create 
good-paying jobs for American work-
ers. That is why infrastructure—big, 
bold infrastructure—remains at the top 
of our priority list. 
There isn’t a community in this 
country without some glaring infra-
structure challenges, be they crum-
bling roads, bridges, or school build-
ings, aging sewer systems, housing 
properties, or unreliable internet. If 
America is going to compete in the 21st 
century, we can’t have an infrastruc-
ture that is stuck in the last century, 
so Congress, in coordination with the 
Biden administration, is going to work 
on a comprehensive jobs and infra-
structure bill this year. 
Today at the White House, President 
Biden will meet with Members from 
both parties to continue bipartisan dis-
cussions on an infrastructure package. 
The President has reiterated his inten-
tion and desire to work in good faith 
with our Republican colleagues. Hope-
fully, our Republican colleagues share 
that willingness and desire. Reliably 
investing in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture used to unite our two parties. It 
can do so again. 
Here in Congress, we are going to 
start getting our teeth into the details 
of an infrastructure package. Right 
here in the Senate, there are numerous 
activities going on this week. Tomor-
row, the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee will hear from four Cabinet- 
level officials on the details of the 
American 
Jobs 
Plan: 
Secretaries 
Buttigieg, Raimondo, and Fudge, as 
well as EPA Administrator Michael 
Regan. Later in the week, the Demo-
cratic Steering and Outreach Com-
mittee 
will 
hear 
from 
Secretaries 
Buttigieg and Raimondo on the Presi-
dent’s Build Back Better agenda, and 
the Democratic caucus will meet with 
the Director of the National Economic 
Council, Brian Deese, on the same sub-
ject. 
As the Senate begins to shape the 
contours of a comprehensive infra-
structure bill, I will soon move to have 
the Senate take up a bipartisan water 
infrastructure bill. This legislation, 
the Drinking Water and Infrastructure 
Act, was advanced by the Environment 
and Public Works Committee on a 
unanimous vote earlier this year. It 
will authorize tens of billions of dollars 
to make sure American families, espe-
cially low-income families, have access 
to safe and clean drinking water. 
The drinking water bill could rep-
resent a small but important first step 
in bringing our two parties together on 
the work on infrastructure. I salute the 
chairman of EPW, TOM CARPER of Dela-
ware, and the ranking member, Sen-
ator CAPITO of West Virginia, for com-
ing together on the legislation. We 
look forward to working with our Re-
publican colleagues later this work pe-
riod to get that piece of legislation 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2003 
April 19, 2021 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Madam President, last week the Sen-
ate began consideration of the COVID– 
19 Hate Crimes Act. It is my under-
standing that the Democratic leader 
hopes a final vote on the bill will occur 
on Wednesday. 
Earnest 
bipartisan 
conversations 
have improved this legislation consid-
erably behind the scenes. Senate Re-
publicans have helped make the bill 
better. And I am confident that with a 
bipartisan process this week that also 
include votes on Republican amend-
ments, we will be able to continue 
moving forward toward the outcome 
the country deserves. 
PROTESTS 
Madam President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, last summer our Nation 
began grappling in a renewed way with 
anger and pain at the fact that our 
progress toward racial justice remains 
unfinished. Rightly understood, this is 
not a struggle against our Nation’s 
founding principles and central pillars; 
rather, it is a journey to make America 
even more faithful to itself to ensure 
that life, liberty, the pursuit of happi-
ness, and equal justice under law are, 
indeed, the birthright of every single 
American. 
Unfortunately, some of last sum-
mer’s demonstrations devolved into 
violent and destructive riots. Small 
businesses were looted, civic monu-
ments were defaced, and government 
buildings attacked, not just insults but 
rocks and Molotov cocktails were 
thrown at the good men and women of 
law enforcement. These were efforts to 
use violence and disorder as a political 
tactic to influence or overrule our 
democratic processes and our justice 
system. 
Now, over the last few weeks, Min-
neapolis returned to center stage with 
the trial of the police officer who is ac-
cused of killing George Floyd last May. 
Again, the causes of civil rights, equal 
justice, and rule of law tell us that this 
trial and every trial must go forward 
without social pressure, political con-
siderations, 
and 
certainly 
violent 
threats playing a role. Every single 
American deserves a fair trial. This is 
sacred. 
You do not balance the scales of jus-
tice by trying to tip them, and yet this 
past weekend, one Democratic House 
Member from California took it upon 
herself to visit the protesters in Min-
neapolis. She said: ‘‘We’re looking for a 
guilty verdict.’’ Like somebody window 
shopping or ordering off a menu, she is 
looking for a guilty verdict. If that ver-
dict is not reached, the Congresswoman 
said demonstrators should ‘‘not only 
stay in the street . . . we’ve got to get 
more 
active 
. . . 
get 
more 
confrontational . . . make sure that 
they know we mean business.’’ 
It is harder to imagine anything 
more inappropriate than a Member of 
Congress flying in from California to 
inform local leaders, not so subtly, 
that this defendant had better be found 
guilty or else there will be big trouble 
in the streets. 
Again, so much of our Nation’s quest 
for civil rights and equal justice has 
been 
the 
fight 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
extrajudicial violence, to get rid of 
rigged trials where the outcome was 
molded by public sentiments or angry 
mobs. It is beyond the pale for a sitting 
Member of the U.S. Congress to look at 
what happened last summer and imply 
there should be some kind of a sequel, 
a sequel if a legal case does not unfold 
as she thinks it should. 
Now, just a few hours after those 
comments, two members, two members 
of the National Guard who were onsite 
in Minneapolis keeping the peace were 
targeted in a driveby shooting. Thank-
fully, neither was seriously injured. 
But let’s hope it doesn’t take an injury 
or a fatality to remind politicians that 
their 
words 
actually 
have 
con-
sequences. 
Earlier this year, of course, the coun-
try heard many strong opinions from 
Democrats about whether leaders bear 
responsibility when reckless words pre-
cede criminal violence. Instead of try-
ing to tilt the scales of justice with 
threats, policymakers should focus on 
actually making policy. 
Last year, Senator TIM SCOTT and 
Senate Republicans tried to pass legis-
lation that would have expanded body 
cameras, increased transparency in po-
licing, and finally made lynching, at 
long last, a Federal crime. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues used the filibuster to 
kill it because it was not anti-police 
enough. Our colleagues on the far left 
have enough work to do here in the 
Capitol without trying to dictate to 
the judicial branch. 
HONG KONG 
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, on Friday, the Chinese Communist 
Party reminded the world what it 
thinks about justice, due process, and 
self-governance. Nine of Hong Kong’s 
most devoted pro-democracy advocates 
received harsh sentences. What was 
their crime? Well, it was inspiring over 
a million people to take to the streets 
in August 2019 to protest peacefully in 
support of basic freedoms. 
It was not the first time Beijing’s 
thin-skinned 
authoritarians 
have 
brought 
the 
hammer 
down 
on 
Hongkongers and, sadly, it will not be 
the last. China’s position is supposedly 
that ‘‘only patriots’’—only patriots 
should be allowed to govern Hong 
Kong. 
Let’s review what it means to be a 
PRC patriot. Apparently, it means ap-
plauding Hong Kong’s new so-called na-
tional security law cooked up by main-
land partisans and the political repres-
sion that it enables. It means applaud-
ing 
saber-rattling 
and 
interference 
with civilian commerce in the South 
China Sea. It means cheering on the 
Communist Party as it uses invasive 
technology to repress dissent at home 
and turning a blind eye to the deten-
tion and killing of religious and ethnic 
minorities in broad daylight. 
Well, the CCP is right that real patri-
ots should be speaking out and leading 
in Hong Kong. They are just wrong 
about who the true patriots actually 
are. Hong Kong’s patriots are people 
like my friends Jimmy Lai and Martin 
Lee, who risk their safety to champion 
democracy. They are the hundreds of 
thousands of peaceful protesters who 
carried the torch even as their coun-
trymen have been imprisoned. 
I appreciate the voices across the 
globe who are calling attention to the 
plight of the real patriots and all the 
other groups in Beijing’s crosshairs. 
To the global business and govern-
ment leaders who haven’t yet spoken 
out, I hope you are watching closely. If 
Beijing 
feels 
comfortable 
treating 
Hongkongers this way, just think how 
little regard the PRC will show for 
basic international norms. 
I am also grateful to our own Amer-
ican leaders who fight for basic human 
rights, including our Religious Free-
dom Commissioners Tony Perkins and 
Gayle Manchin, who have themselves 
been comically blacklisted by Beijing 
and rightly wear that as a badge of 
honor. 
I hope the administration will add 
teeth to its tough talk on China and re-
assure our friends in Hong Kong that 
we have their backs.

jority whip. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
was sure that I wouldn’t like him. I 
was convinced that we weren’t going to 
get along. I had so many grievances 
against President George W. Bush—the 
war in Iraq, the interrogation of pris-
oners—I really was prepared not to like 
him at all, and then I met him. Darn it. 
I met him and I liked him and I still 
do. 
We still have some profound dif-
ferences on issues. I think back on his 
Presidency, and there are some things 
that I want to give him credit for. 
First and foremost, I want to thank 
him for being our President during 9/11 
because, if you remember what he said 
after 9/11—and how profound it is in 
light of our history since—he said our 
war against terrorism is not against 
people of the Islamic faith; it is a faith 
of peace. What a remarkable statement 
to make by a President because we 
have seen just the opposite since by an-
other President from his party. 
He did great work when it came to 
global health, extraordinary work. He 
changed the world for the better. I was 
glad to be his ally in that effort. 
That wasn’t the sum total of all the 
work on the good side of the ledger 
that he had done, and I won’t recount 
the areas of disagreement because 
there were many, but I do want to tell 
you that I was touched, personally 
touched by an article that President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2004 
April 19, 2021 
George W. Bush wrote in the Wash-
ington Post this weekend. It was about 
his new book, a collection of paintings 
entitled ‘‘Out of Many, One.’’ 
He said, in putting this book to-
gether, he was really setting ‘‘out to 
accomplish two things: to share some 
portraits of immigrants’’—and he has 
become 
an 
accomplished 
painter— 
‘‘each with a remarkable story,’’ he 
says, ‘‘I try to tell, and to humanize 
the debate on immigration and re-
form.’’ 
George W. Bush, a proud Republican, 
speaks not only to the people of Amer-
ica but especially to his own political 
party in this article. ‘‘I hope that these 
faces, and the stories that accompany 
them, serve as a reminder,’’ he writes, 
‘‘that immigration isn’t just part of 
our heritage. New Americans are just 
as much a force for good now, with 
their energy, idealism and love of 
country, as they have always been.’’ 
He goes on to talk about some of the 
amazing stories, the story of a young 
man from France who followed his 
dream to become an American soldier 
and went on to earn the Medal of 
Honor, the story of a champion runner 
who barely survived ethnic violence in 
East Africa and who told President 
Bush: ‘‘America has given me every-
thing I dreamed of as a boy.’’ 
He says the backgrounds of these im-
migrants 
are 
varied, 
‘‘but 
readers 
won’t have to search hard for a com-
mon theme.’’ President Bush writes: 
‘‘It’s gratitude. So many immigrants 
are filled with appreciation, a spirit 
nicely summed up,’’ he writes, ‘‘by a 
Cuban American friend who said: ‘If I 
live for a hundred years, I could never 
repay what this country has done for 
me.’’’ 
President Bush writes: ‘‘The help and 
respect historically accorded to new ar-
rivals is one reason so many people 
still aspire and wait to become Ameri-
cans.’’ And then he asks the important 
question: ‘‘How is it that in a country 
more generous to new arrivals than 
any other, immigration policy is a 
source of so much rancor and ill will?’’ 
The short answer, he says, is that the 
issue has been exploited in ways that 
do little credit to either party. And no 
proposal on immigration will have 
credibility without confidence that our 
laws are carried out consistently and 
in good faith. 
‘‘One place to start,’’ bless him, he 
writes, ‘‘is DACA (Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals.) Americans,’’ he 
writes, ‘‘who favor a path to citizen-
ship for those brought here as children, 
known as ‘dreamers,’ are not advo-
cating open borders. They just recog-
nize that young men and women who 
grew up in the United States, and who 
never knew any other place as home, 
are fundamentally American. And they 
ought not be punished for choices made 
by their parents.’’ 
Let me just add, thank you, Presi-
dent Bush. He speaks of our border, and 
he should. Another opportunity for 
agreement, he calls it. ‘‘I have long 
said that we can be both a lawful and a 
welcoming nation at the same time.’’ 
He writes we need a secure and effi-
cient border, and we should apply all 
the necessary resources to ensure it. 
He goes on to say we need a modern-
ized asylum system that provides hu-
manitarian support and appropriate 
legal channels for refugees. The rules 
for asylum should be reformed by Con-
gress to guard against unmerited entry 
and reserve that vital status for its in-
tended recipients. 
I don’t disagree with a word he has 
written. ‘‘Increased legal immigration, 
focused on employment and skills,’’ 
and here we may have some area of dis-
agreement, ‘‘is also a choice that both 
parties should be able to get behind.’’ 
He also writes about improving our 
temporary entry program for some 
workers. 
And listen to what President George 
W. Bush writes about the undocu-
mented in America, estimated to be in 
the numbers of millions, 11 million. 
Here is what he says: ‘‘As for the mil-
lions of undocumented men and women 
currently living in the United States, a 
grant of amnesty would be fundamen-
tally unfair to those who came legally 
or are still waiting their turn to be-
come citizens. But undocumented im-
migrants should be brought out of the 
shadows through a gradual process in 
which legal residency and citizenship 
must be earned, as for anyone else ap-
plying for that privilege. Requirements 
should include . . . work history, pay-
ment of a fine and back taxes, English 
proficiency,’’ and other things. 
He closes by saying: ‘‘If we trust 
those instincts in the current debate, 
then bipartisan reform is possible. And 
we will again see immigration for what 
it is: not a problem and source of dis-
cord, but a great and defining asset of 
the United States.’’ 
I was touched by those words and 
still am that he would be so caring and 
so pointed in his message. That is the 
basis for bipartisan immigration re-
form which America desperately needs. 
Now I am looking for George W. Bush 
and the Republicans to join the Demo-
crats in a bipartisan effort to get it 
done. I have called together a group for 
that purpose, and we are going to meet 
again soon to talk about the progress 
that we might be able to make. 
I do want to thank the President. We 
have a job to do, and we need the val-
ues that George W. Bush still brings to 
the American people in this debate. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Madam President, over the weekend 
in Chicago, a 13-year-old boy, Adam 
Toledo, on March 29, in the wee hours 
of the morning, was stopped by police 
and shot and killed in an alley in the 
city of Chicago. 
Thousands have been gathering since 
in his memory. The videotape of the ar-
rest was released last week, and there 
is that stark moment with his hands 
up, and he is being shot and killed—13 
years old. 
There is a lengthy debate going on in 
our city and our Nation about the role 
of the police, the fairness of law en-
forcement, and what is happening with 
children in areas of poverty and guns. 
This past weekend, our Nation’s epi-
demic of gun violence continued to 
devastate families and communities. 
The Adam Toledo tape wasn’t the only 
thing that happened. 
In the city of Chicago, yesterday, 
Sunday, 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams was 
shot and killed in the backseat of a car 
while with her father at a McDonald’s 
drive-through. She was one of 27 people 
shot in Chicago this weekend—5 of 
them fatally. 
In Kenosha, in the Presiding Officer’s 
home State, a gunman in a tavern, on 
Sunday morning, killed three people 
and wounded three more. 
In Austin, TX, three people were fa-
tally shot on Sunday morning in a re-
ported domestic violence incident. 
Then, on Thursday of last week and 
for the third time this year, there was 
another mass shooting in Indianapolis 
at a FedEx facility. Eight people died. 
These were just some of the more 
than 100 Americans who are killed 
every single day by guns in this Na-
tion. This, unfortunately, is not an iso-
lated set of incidents, and this is not 
just a rare tragic weekend. This is 
America 2021. One of the key parts of 
an effective response to this crisis is 
understanding it, and that raises im-
portant questions about the news cov-
erage of gun violence as well as any-
thing else. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD an April 5 col-
umn of the Chicago Tribune, entitled: 
‘‘Why aren’t Chicago’s mass shootings 
included in the outcry over recent vio-
lence in Atlanta, Colorado and Cali-
fornia?’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 5, 2021] 
COLUMN: WHY AREN’T CHICAGO’S MASS SHOOT-
INGS INCLUDED IN THE OUTCRY OVER RECENT 
VIOLENCE IN ATLANTA, COLORADO AND CALI-
FORNIA? 
(By Heidi Stevens) 
When a gunman killed four people and 
wounded a fifth at a Southern California of-
fice building last week, news outlets, over 
and over, called it the third in a string of 
mass shootings. 
‘‘The violence in the city of Orange was 
the third major mass shooting in just over 
two weeks,’’ an Associated Press story pub-
lished on chicagotribune.com read. ‘‘Last 
week a gunman opened fire at a supermarket 
in Boulder, Colorado, and killed 10. A week 
before that, six Asian women were among 
eight people killed at three Atlanta-area 
spas.’’ 
No mention of Chicago. 
In Sunday’s New York Times, Nicholas 
Kristof wrote a column headlined, ‘‘How do 
we stop the parade of gun deaths?’’ Chicago 
gun deaths were nowhere to be found. 
But 15 people were shot at a party in Chi-
cago’s Park Manor neighborhood on March 
14 (two days before the Atlanta-area shoot-
ings) and eight people were shot outside a 
Wrightwood 
neighborhood 
storefront 
on 
March 26 (four days after the Boulder shoot-
ing and five days before the Orange shoot-
ing.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2005 
April 19, 2021 
What does it say that the violence here is 
so rarely included in larger discussions—in 
the media, among politicians—about mass 
shootings and the trauma they inflict on our 
nation? 
‘‘Mass shootings are mass shootings when 
they involve white people,’’ Shaka Rawls, 
principal of Leo Catholic High School in Chi-
cago’s Auburn Gresham neighborhood, told 
me. ‘‘When they’re Black people, it’s just 
something that happened over there. When 
it’s violence perpetrated by and on Black 
people, the mainstream media can easily 
turn its back and say, ‘This is what happens 
in those communities.’ But the impact is 
huge on those communities.’’ 
I called Rawls because the school he leads 
is located down the street from the funeral 
home where 15 people were shot on a Tues-
day evening in July. Rawls raced to the 
scene as soon as he heard the news. 
‘‘I will never unsee that,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m 
traumatized by that, and this isn’t my first 
rodeo. People are laid out on the ground. 
People are crying. There’s no ambulance on 
the scene yet. I’m a school principal. I’m not 
trained for this.’’ 
But in the days and weeks that followed, 
he found himself having to advocate for his 
students and staff to receive counseling and 
support, when he expected to be fielding of-
fers of help. 
‘‘So many things that happen in my com-
munity are not looked at as violence per-
petrated on human beings,’’ he said. ‘‘Some-
times we have to remind people that these 
are humans. The people experiencing this 
trauma are humans.’’ 
On a day-to-day basis, Chicago’s gun vio-
lence doesn’t go unnoticed or unremarked 
upon. City residents and leaders face near- 
constant criticism and ridicule for our dev-
astatingly high number of shootings and 
deaths. 
But I hear those shootings and deaths 
lobbed as a jeer far more often than I hear 
them urgently, thoughtfully discussed as a 
crisis deserving of all-hands-on-deck solu-
tions. And the failure to include Chicago in 
the national discourse about mass shootings 
feels like a symptom of this larger problem: 
an ‘‘othering’’ of our violence—as if it isn’t 
as tragic, isn’t as much of an assault on hu-
manity, isn’t as deserving of widespread calls 
for answers and reform. 
‘‘It’s because we’re killing each other, so 
it’s nothing out of the ordinary,’’ said 
Danielle Stipe-Patterson, 32, who lives in 
Park Manor. ‘‘When it should be out of the 
ordinary. This is traumatic. This is trauma. 
I can’t even watch certain TV shows because 
I’m living it. Why watch it for entertain-
ment when I literally hear the gunshots 
every other night?’’ 
Stipe-Patterson’s dad was shot to death in 
Roseland when she was 8 years old. He was 
outside washing his car when he was killed. 
‘‘He wasn’t affiliated with any gangs,’’ 
Stipe-Patterson said. ‘‘He was just a boy 
from Louisiana who had seven kids and two 
jobs.’’ 
For several years, Stipe-Patterson worked 
as a program associate for the Illinois Coun-
cil Against Handgun Violence conducting 
workshops and speaking to students in and 
around Chicago about gun violence and the 
importance of mental health resources for 
both prevention and healing. 
‘‘At the beginning, I felt like I made a dif-
ference,’’ she said. ‘‘I was able to share my 
story with kids who lost a parent or an uncle 
or a brother, showing them that you can still 
make it. After a while, sharing the story 
over and over and over and coming home and 
living the problem in the community, it was 
taxing.’’ 
Now she works for a nonprofit that offers 
arts programming to kids who can’t attend 
school because of chronic illness. 
She started to feel like legislators and 
other people in positions of power were less 
interested in addressing the root causes—ra-
cial segregation, long-term disinvestment on 
the South and West sides, lack of mental 
health resources, underfunded schools, re-
peated exposure to trauma—and more inter-
ested in simply chalking up Chicago’s vio-
lence to gangs. 
After a recent shooting on her block, 
Stipe-Patterson said she and other neighbors 
tried to get information from police about 
what happened, how they might help solve 
the crime, and what to be on the lookout for. 
‘‘They wouldn’t tell me anything,’’ she 
said. ‘‘You have to solve these things in the 
community, but how are we supposed to be a 
community if y’all aren’t allowing us to be a 
community? How are we supposed to change 
stuff if y’all aren’t being transparent with 
us?’’ 
Every shooting—whether it takes place on 
a city sidewalk or inside a church or at a 
suburban high school—is a product of what 
the shooter experienced in life, Rawls said. 
‘‘Poverty, a desperate outlook on life, poor 
parenting, bullying at school,’’ he said. ‘‘How 
did they get the weapon? What’s the eco-
nomic impact on that community? What’s 
the social and emotional impact on that 
community? There is not a catchall solution, 
but those should be the questions in every 
case. Every case.’’ 
Firearms are the leading cause of death for 
children and teens in Illinois, said Kathleen 
Sances, president and CEO of G-PAC Illinois, 
a gun violence prevention political action 
committee. 
‘‘An average of 183 children and teens die 
by guns every year in Illinois,’’ Sances said. 
‘‘The gun violence crisis disproportionately 
affects Black and brown children and teens, 
who are 13 times more likely to die from gun 
violence than their white counterparts. 
‘‘Black and brown children are dying and 
nobody’s doing anything about it,’’ she con-
tinued. ‘‘People who don’t live in impacted 
communities don’t see the violence. They 
dissociate themselves from those people. And 
I think the media reinforces this perspec-
tive.’’ 
I agree. Yet, as a member of the media, I 
am engaged in an endless internal dialogue 
about how and how much to write about the 
violence in my beloved city. Too little is an 
insult to the human lives shattered by it and 
a dodging of the responsibility to shine light 
on our most pressing problems. Too much 
risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about 
a city that is so much more than the vio-
lence that has forever plagued it. 
Rawls said he feels similarly conflicted 
over whether he wants more attention paid 
to Chicago’s mass shootings, whether he 
would want to see Chicago listed alongside 
Atlanta and Boulder and Orange in an AP 
story. 
If the attention would result in more fed-
eral resources directed at the problem? If the 
attention were accompanied by an interest 
in solving the root causes of gun violence, an 
understanding of Chicago’s porous borders 
through which weapons flow, an acknowledg-
ment of the levels of trauma and fear that 
many of his students carry on their shoul-
ders? Sure. 
‘‘But the conversations don’t have that 
tone,’’ he said. ‘‘There’s a, ‘That’s what they 
get. They shouldn’t have been there’ tone. 
I’ve seen it.’’ 
More media attention? More politicians in-
voking Chicago in their gun reform speech-
es? 
‘‘It could be like throwing water on a 
grease fire,’’ Rawls said. 
I believe we can do better. I believe we—we 
in the media, we in Chicago, we Americans— 
can refuse to settle into a place where we ac-
cept gun violence as simply the cost of living 
in this city, where we experience the gun vi-
olence here as somehow less remarkable and 
less remarked upon than gun violence else-
where. Bullets shattering a funeral on 79th 
Street are every bit as repellent to human

‘‘I think the best thing to remember is 
that the things that divide us are socially 
constructed,’’ Rawls said. ‘‘The things that 
separate us are created by society. And if we 
created them, we can dismantle them. I 
would like for everyone to see each other as 
humans, to see this is a problem happening 
to humans, not just those people over 
there.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. Heidi Stevens’ column 
in the Tribune points out that the 
media often subjectively defines and 
covers what it considers to be mass 
shootings. All too often, mass shoot-
ings in communities of color are left 
out of the coverage, and this is wrong. 
It is unfair. It is nothing short of an 
outrage. It needs to change. 
We need to understand the full scope 
of this crisis that is killing so many 
Americans, 
with 
reliable, 
objective 
data that is quickly made available. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention keeps count, but there is a 
time lag with its data on firearm 
deaths and injuries. Right now, the lat-
est official CDC report on gun deaths is 
from the year 2019. There is a website, 
though, Gun Violence Archive, that 
keeps track of shooting incidents vir-
tually on a realtime basis. 
I believe that news coverage of mass 
shootings in America should use the 
definition and statistics provided by 
the Gun Violence Archive. They define 
a mass shooting as an incident in 
which four or more people are shot and 
either killed or injured, not including 
the shooter. It is a purely numerical 
standard. It is not subjective. Accord-
ing to the Gun Violence Archive’s defi-
nition—I want to put this on the record 
in the Senate—so far this year, by its 
definition, there have been 153 mass 
shootings. Yet we are only 109 days 
into the year. Nine of this year’s mass 
shootings so far have taken place in 
Chicago. Four people have been fatally 
shot in these shootings, and 50 have 
been injured. It is important to gather 
this data as quickly as possible so that 
we can respond effectively. 
Last week, I spoke on the floor and 
commended President Biden for speak-
ing out. He recently announced an im-
portant set of Executive actions on gun 
violence: steps to limit untraceable 
ghost guns, help for States to pursue 
extreme risk protection orders. Inci-
dentally, the State law in Indiana was 
not, 
apparently, 
solid 
enough 
or 
tamperproof enough and was overcome 
there by the latest mass shooting. 
There is the reporting on firearms traf-
ficking patterns and nominating expe-
rienced veteran David Chipman to be 
the first Senate-confirmed Director of 
that Agency since 2015. 
You see, many of the critics of gun 
safety legislation say to just enforce 
the laws we have, but if you have been 
around the Senate for more than 15

minutes, you will realize the Agency 
that has a major responsibility in that, 
the ATF, is notorious for being under-
funded, understaffed, and going with-
out leadership. That is part of the de-
sign of the people who really don’t even 
want to see the laws enforced. 
I am particularly encouraged by 
President Biden’s commitment to pro-
viding Federal resources for commu-
nity violence interdiction programs 
through the American Jobs Plan and 
other grant programs. This is the type 
of serious investment we need to tackle 
this crisis. This President is taking 
constitutional, commonsense steps to 
reduce gun violence, but what have we 
done? Nothing. 
I held a hearing on gun violence in 
the Judiciary Committee a few weeks 
ago. We are going to hold more as Sen-
ator 
BLUMENTHAL, 
of 
Connecticut, 
chairs the subcommittee with that re-
sponsibility. Hearings are important so 
that we can put together legislative re-
forms 
and 
appropriate 
funds. 
The 
House has already passed a bipartisan 
bill to close gaps in the gun back-
ground check system. Really, the ball 
is in the Senate’s court at this mo-
ment. We need 10 Senate Republicans 
to help us get to the 60 votes necessary 
to overcome Republican filibusters. 
Will our Republican colleagues stand 
up and vote to close these gaps in the 
law? Will our Republican colleagues 
support the President’s call for funding 
community violence interdiction? 
We need to act. Saving lives from gun 
violence should not be a partisan issue. 
It is an American tragedy. Sadly, we 
learn by the day that it is not an exclu-
sive blue State problem. It is a blue 
State and a red State problem. It is an 
American problem. We have had too 
many mass shootings and too many 
Americans dying in gun homicides, sui-
cides, and accidents. Let’s take the 
bold action that meets the scale of this 
public health crisis. Our Nation is 
counting on us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, today, I want to talk about two 
very important topics to America and 
to the folks back home in Alabama: 
President Biden’s so-called infrastruc-
ture proposal and his proposed budget 
for the Department of Defense. 
Now, I know infrastructure and de-
fense aren’t exactly the peanut butter 
and jelly of issues, but let me tell you 
how they go together. With these two 
proposals, the American people can 
plainly see just how out of place Presi-
dent Biden’s priorities are. 
I have traveled every corner of Ala-
bama, from Mobile to Muscle Shoals, 
to our State’s rural communities and 
urban centers. All the time, I hear that 
we need improvements to our transpor-
tation and infrastructure, and I have 
seen it with my own eyes. There are 
over 100,000 miles of public roads and 
16,000 bridges in Alabama. More than 
1,000 of those bridges have been con-
demned. Driving on poor roads costs 
Alabama drivers a total of $4.2 billion 
annually due to vehicle operating 
costs, traffic congestion, and car crash-
es. 
Yet it is not just Alabama. It is ev-
erywhere in our country. I have spent 
decades traveling around the country 
as a football coach, and I am here to 
tell you we need help. We need help 
with our infrastructure. Investment in 
infrastructure is important and very, 
very necessary. Sound infrastructure 
allows people to get work, keeps our 
goods flowing, and keeps America com-
petitive. That is why every penny of 
every dollar of any infrastructure pro-
posal should be spent on actual infra-
structure. 
Sadly, President Biden’s proposal 
fails that test by a long shot. Out of 
this massive $2.25 trillion proposal, 
only 6 percent is for roads and bridges. 
In fact, the proposal puts more money 
toward 
electric 
cars 
than 
roads, 
bridges, ports, and waterways com-
bined. We have to stop treating govern-
ment spending like it is monopoly 
money. When the American people hear 
about what is included in this bill, I 
think they will agree. 
The Biden administration is using 
the umbrella term of ‘‘infrastructure’’ 
for a host of things folks back home 
don’t associate with the word. Here are 
a couple of spending items that qualify 
as 
‘‘infrastructure,’’ 
according 
to 
President Biden: $400 billion for nurs-
ing care and $213 billion for govern-
ment housing. I can see and understand 
where those fit in but not in an infra-
structure bill. What gets me is the $10 
billion per year for a Civilian Climate 
Corps. This $10 billion includes free 
housing, free clothing, free food, and an 
allowance for members while they pro-
mote ‘‘climate justice’’—$10 billion a 
year. Now, is that infrastructure? 
We can debate the individual merits 
of these items, but, please, let’s not 
pretend these are for infrastructure, 
because we need true infrastructure. 
To call this an infrastructure proposal 
is really an insult to the English lan-
guage. The definition of ‘‘infrastruc-
ture’’ is not the ‘‘kitchen sink’’ ap-
proach. Let’s call this proposal what it 
is—a farce. This proposal is simply the 
Green New Deal in disguise. They need 
to disguise it because actual infra-
structure improvement is popular, and 
the Green New Deal is not. 
In order to pay for all of this spend-
ing, President Biden has proposed rais-
ing the corporate tax by 7 percent—the 
largest Federal tax increase since 1993. 
This would undo President Trump’s 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which spurred 
the greatest economy we have had in 
decades. I can tell you right now the 
worst possible time to raise taxes is in 
the middle of a crisis. So many em-
ployers have already been hit hard and 
are just trying to get back on their 
feet. Remember who really ends up 
paying for tax increases, especially 
corporate tax rates. It is the consumer, 
like you and me. It is not the corpora-
tions. 
As Americans for Tax Reform has 
pointed out, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
directly led to lower utility bills for 
hard-working folks across the country. 
Raising taxes would directly raise elec-
tric bills on millions of Americans, es-
sentially taxing them, too. Tax in-
creases threaten family-owned small 
businesses and family farms, forcing 
future generations to sell the legacies 
their parents and their grandparents 
worked so hard to build. 
Here is the real kicker. As the Demo-
crats are out there peddling this pro-
posal as ‘‘infrastructure’’ and ‘‘jobs,’’ 
President Biden’s tax increase will 
eliminate 1 million jobs in the first 2 
years alone, according to the National 
Association of Manufacturers—all of 
that harm just to pay for the Demo-
crats’ wish list consisting of the Green 
New Deal. That absolutely makes no 
sense. We need to be focused on cre-
ating jobs and getting folks back to 
work, not destroying jobs for progres-
sive pipe dreams down the road. 
This comes on the heels of a massive 
stimulus that just passed—the one the 
Democrats called COVID relief, but, 
really, less than 10 percent of the bill 
went to COVID and health-related 
measures. 
With all the trillions of new spending 
proposed by the Biden administration 
so far, you would think that there 
wasn’t any spending proposal that they 
didn’t like. 
Yet when it comes to our national 
defense, President Biden has shown he 
cares very little about increasing in-
vestment to keep our country safe. 
President Biden recently released his 
‘‘skinny budget,’’ which includes a cut 
of $7 billion for the Department of De-
fense after accounting for inflation. 
President Biden’s proposal and pro-
posed defense budget is disappointing, 
dangerous, and a disservice to the men 
and women in uniform. What is more 
bewildering is that it asks for our 
troops to do more on a shoestring 
budget. It adds more duties, like com-
bating climate change and other social 
priorities of the Democrats to our al-
ready thinly stretched forces, and that 
is very, very dangerous. 
Regardless of whether these indi-
vidual duties may be warranted—and, 
for the record, I don’t think they are— 
we shouldn’t expect our military to do 
more with less. At a time when our en-
emies grow bolder and the threats to 
America are increasing, ‘‘do more with 
less’’ is the last thing we should tell 
them to do. 
These threats to our Nation are real, 
and they are getting worse. Russia is 
likely preparing to invade Ukraine and 
finish what Putin started in Crimea. 
North Korea continues to test ballistic 
missiles. Iran is emboldened to con-
tinue its nuclear weapons program. 
And then there is China. In recent 
weeks, China has bullied Taiwan. They 
think now is the time to test the 
United States of America. China is

building up their military to directly 
challenge the United States for global 
supremacy. 
Over the last 10 years, China’s de-
fense spending increased by $200 bil-
lion, while the United States of Amer-
ica decreased its defense budget $400 
billion. 
We cannot let China continue to gain 
ground. In order to keep our country 
safe and protect democratic allies from 
Chinese aggression, we must stay well 
ahead of both weapons and techno-
logical advances. 
President Biden’s defense budget is 
not just dangerous for America. It is 
bad for us all. Across our State, Ala-
bama has more than 200,000 jobs sup-
porting national defense. The economic 
impact of the defense sector represents 
more than 8 percent of our State’s 
GDP. 
By underinvesting in defense, the 
critical work done by the service men 
and women at Alabama military instal-
lations—including Redstone Arsenal, 
Fort Rucker, Maxwell-Gunter, and oth-
ers—could be seriously hindered. It will 
set back our entire State’s economy. 
I was just at Redstone Arsenal in 
Huntsville, where I heard firsthand 
from Army Material Command how 
badly we need to invest in modernizing 
our weapons systems across the world. 
The best way to avoid a conflict is to 
have a bigger and better gun than the 
other guy. Most of President Biden’s 
appointees at the Department of De-
fense support the 2018 National Defense 
Strategy, which is a comprehensive 
plan to compete, deter, and defeat our 
adversaries. 
This defense budget threatens our 
military 
modernization 
efforts 
and 
America’s ability to provide combat- 
ready forces. We cannot allow anything 
close to President Biden’s defense 
budget to become law. Our military 
needs to focus on winning wars, not 
planting trees. 
The people of Alabama and the men 
and women in uniform should know 
that I will stand up to President Biden 
and the globalists in his administra-
tion who want a weak military. 
President Biden has gone on and on 
about unity and his reputation for 
reaching across the aisle, but ever 
since he came into office, his actions 
have been focused on appeasing the far- 
left, progressive voices in his party. We 
saw it firsthand with the stimulus bill. 
Shortly after that, we get this loaded- 
up, inappropriately named ‘‘infrastruc-
ture’’ proposal. 
It is not just about the spending, 
which is a lot, but it is about what is 
in these proposals—progressive wish- 
list items that are paid for by the 
American taxpayer, not the govern-
ment, the American taxpayer—and are 
passed on party lines, not bipartisan. 
And that is where President Biden’s 
priorities clearly lie. He is signaling 
that he is more willing to invest in pro-
gressive policy items than the safety of 
our Nation and the world. 
My colleagues and I are interested in 
working with President Biden on a bi-
partisan bill that addresses actual in-
frastructure, and we are ready to work 
on a defense budget that actually in-
vests in our military and prepares us 
against the growing threats. We just 
need a President willing to unite rath-
er than divide our great country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, over the past few weeks, my Re-
publican colleagues and I have spent 
quite a bit of time making sure the 
American people know just how little 
of President Biden’s 2-plus trillion dol-
lar infrastructure plan will fund actual 
infrastructure plans to fix roads and 
bridges that are so in need of repair. 
These are things that the Ten-
nesseans have repeatedly told me they 
want to see in a bill: Fix the roads. Fix 
the bridges. 
What do they want to be taken out of 
that bill? They want to get rid of some 
of these provisions that have nothing 
to do with infrastructure—nothing. 
So imagine their disappointment— 
people who are ready for a highway 
bill, who are ready for a transportation 
bill, who are ready for an infrastruc-
ture bill—imagine their disappoint-
ment when they discovered that all the 
funding that they had hoped was going 
to go to potholes and expanding lanes 
on the interstate and fixing flooded 
back roads would instead be spent on 
electric cars, union advocates, and cli-
mate change ambassadors. 
I know pothole repair isn’t flashy, 
but it is what Tennesseans need. An 
electric car does not do you one bit of 
good when you are going to have to 
have a four-by-four to go pull it out of 
the mud every single time it rains. 
We are pretty practical people, and 
my wish would be that my colleagues 
across the aisle would join us in re-
viewing the needs of the American peo-
ple—the needs of the American peo-
ple—and in being practical. 
The lack of practicality has been a 
recurring problem in the months since 
President Biden took office. It seems 
that the Democrats here in Wash-
ington, DC, can’t resist the urge to 
throw money at social-media friendly 
causes that not even the most talented 
communicators have been able to tie to 
the pressing needs of the American 
people. They did it with COVID relief, 
and now they are doing it with this in-
frastructure boondoggle. 
The wish list just doesn’t match the 
PR campaign, and that is a shame be-
cause this country has its own wish list 
of urgently needed items that we really 
can no longer afford to ignore. 
Just a few weeks ago, I took my own 
trip down to the southern border to get 
a sense of the situation on the ground, 
and it is a dire situation. We are facing 
an environmental crisis, a national se-
curity crisis, and a humanitarian crisis 
that is massive in scope. If we want to 
talk about infrastructure projects that 
matter, let’s talk about all the infra-
structure that President Biden aban-
doned back in January when he halted 
construction on the wall. 
To paraphrase a famous saying, a 450- 
mile-long stretch of border wall serves 
the purpose right up until you hit mile 
451, and here you can see that is the 
situation that ranchers and law en-
forcement officials in southern Arizona 
are dealing with. The construction just 
stopped. 
President Biden’s proclamation or-
dered contractors to stop work and 
abandon 
their 
progress—immediate, 
stop. So they walked away because 
they had to. 
What did they leave? They left be-
hind an unfinished wall, piles of sup-
plies, and roads and other infrastruc-
ture built to support construction 
crews. Everything is sitting there—sit-
ting there at the border. The equip-
ment, the border wall—it is all there 
wasting away—tax dollars right there. 
All of that is now vulnerable to ex-
ploitation by the cartels and the traf-
fickers because it is sitting there on 
the border. This is an absolute shame— 
an absolute shame. And what we know 
is that the cartels and the traffickers— 
whether they are drug traffickers or 
sex traffickers, or whether they are 
moving gangs—they are taking full ad-
vantage of this situation. 
I got the chance to see where the 
coyotes and the drug smugglers are 
coming across, now that there is no ac-
tivity on the border to deter them from 
using access points built into the wall 
for their own purposes. 
In Cochise County alone, officials 
have seen a 200-percent increase in mi-
grants this year—200 percent. 
The holes in the wall have turned 
into walking paths for the Sinaloa car-
tel’s drug runners. Law enforcement of-
ficials have set up an extensive net-
work of cameras, but there are only so 
many leads that they can chase when 
the Border Patrol agents, who should 
be supporting these efforts, are busy 
implementing useless—useless and det-
rimental—catch-and-release programs. 
And see, you see where there is a gap 
in the wall. Why do you have these 
gaps? Because the doors that were to 
go into these gaps are sitting, not in 
place. Why do you have these gaps? 
You have them because the wall com-
ponents are there in the dirt. 
But what did President Biden say? As 
of today, no more. No more. Stop im-
mediately. Halt. Do not build this wall. 
And what is it that our Border Patrol 
tell us that they need? They need a 
wall, they need more technology, and 
they need more agents and officers on 
the ground. This has been their request 
for years—for years. 
On private property along the border, 
you can see where migrants have 
ditched their old clothes in exchange 
for actual uniforms that identify them 
to a cartel because they are given them 
by the cartel. It is their cartel-issued 
clothing, much like a work uniform. 
There 
are 
piles 
of 
discarded 
backpacks, water bottles, and medicine 
at regular intervals. There is no telling

if the people who abandoned these 
items made it out alive, because we 
know many do not make it out alive. 
Many of them are left to die in the 
desert by their handlers, the coyotes, 
and the cartels. It is vital to note that 
you do not cross that border unless you 
are working with the cartel, which 
means you have paid the cartel a fee to 
come across that border or you have 
agreed to go into modern-day slavery 
and work out your fee. Whether it is 
with a labor gang, an MS–13 gang, sex 
trafficking gang, you have to work 
that fee out once you come across. 
Now the ranchers who own these long 
stretches of property have seen evi-
dence of this evil disregard for human 
life. They will tell you their lands are 
no longer safe, they do not feel free, 
and they are constantly on their guard 
for the safety of themselves and their 
property. 
I understand that immigration en-
forcement is controversial—so much so 
that during his campaign, President 
Biden promised to avoid the issue en-
tirely by halting construction of the 
border wall forever. But we are living 
in the real world now, and in the real 
world, the globe’s most powerful and 
free Republic is being taken advantage 
of by the West’s most terrifying drug 
lords and human rights abusers, and 
the Biden administration is letting it 
happen. Congressional Democrats are 
letting it happen. Even though they 
don’t want to admit it, it is happening. 
Look at the reports. Look at the foot-
age. Talk to Customs and Border Pa-
trol, and talk to the sheriffs in these 
counties. 
So I say to my Democratic col-
leagues: Do something. Do something. 
Work with us to find common ground 
and get this situation under control be-
fore it is too late. And realize that 
every town is a border town and every 
State is a border State until that bor-
der is secure. 
If you care about human rights, if 
you care about infrastructure, please 
care about this issue—care about this 
issue—the environmental crisis, the 
humanitarian crisis, and the national 
security crisis. 
You can spend the next 4 years sit-
ting on your hands and blaming Presi-
dent Trump or Leader MCCONNELL or 
me or any of my Republican colleagues 
and blame us and say: Well, there is 
death. There is destruction. There are 
drugs. And all of that is happening 
along this border. But that is the thing 
about winning elections—they do have 
consequences. And the consequence 
that is facing our Democratic col-
leagues right now is leading and lead-
ing on this issue. You own this crisis. 
You own this crisis. It is from Presi-
dent Biden’s failed immigration and 
border strategy. If you fail to act, you 
will forever own the tragedy—the abso-
lute tragedy that is unfolding along 
our southern border.

OFFICER

ANNIVERSARY OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this 
week marks the 26th anniversary of the 
worst domestic terrorist attack in his-
tory, and that was the Oklahoma City 
bombing. Each year, we mark this sol-
emn occasion, and this year, we come 
together to do it again. 
I remember that day so clearly where 
168 people were murdered. I remember 
the thundering cadence of the police 
officers, the firemen, and all the first 
responders as they were going into 
the—standing there watching them 
going into a burning building, risking 
their lives, and many of them died. I 
had close friends who died that day, 
and I know there were so many others 
who lost family and friends and loved 
ones. It was a day that forever changed 
our proud State. 
I was flying my plane back from the 
Mexican border to Tulsa, and I didn’t 
have quite enough gas. I had to make a 
stop in Dallas. I looked up at the FBO, 
and there were crowds of people around 
that TV set in Dallas. I went to see 
what they were watching, and I recog-
nized it. It was our downtown Okla-
homa City buildings. The disaster had 
taken place, and everyone was watch-
ing. 
We could have let that moment de-
fine us and change us for the worse, 
and it would have been a lot easier to 
do that, but that is not the Oklahoma 
way. Second Corinthians reminds us to 
not lose heart in times of struggle and 
tragedy, and Oklahoma did not lose 
heart. What arose from the rubble that 
day was the Oklahoma Standard— 
strangers helping strangers, giving sac-
rificially, and performing acts of serv-
ice for each other. 
I also want to take a moment to rec-
ognize the work of the Oklahoma City 
National Memorial & Museum. For the 
past two decades, they have upheld 
their charge to honor those who were 
killed, those who survived, and those 
who were changed forever. 
So, today, please join me as we re-
member the victims, their families, 
and loved ones, as well as extend our 
thanks to all the first responders who 
were forever changed on April 19, 1995. 
Let’s honor them by taking a moment 
to rededicate ourselves to live the 
Oklahoma Standard embodied in the 
actions of so many on that fateful day. 
We owe it to them. 
I yield the floor.

ator from California. 
NOMINATION OF VANITA GUPTA 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
also rise today to offer my strong sup-
port for the nomination of Ms. Vanita 
Gupta to be the Associate Attorney 
General of the United States. 
In the 44-year history of the position, 
a woman of color has never served as 
Associate Attorney General of the 
United States. We have the oppor-
tunity to confirm a qualified, proven, 
and respected woman of color in Ms. 
Gupta, and the Senate should not delay 
any longer. 
As Associate Attorney General, Ms. 
Gupta 
would 
help 
restore 
profes-
sionalism, empathy, and dignity to the 
highest levels of the Justice Depart-
ment. Through more than 5 hours of 
testimony—5 hours—before the Judici-
ary Committee and in a lengthy career 
in public service, Ms. Gupta has dem-
onstrated exactly why our Nation 
would be well served by her leadership 
in the Department of Justice. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Gupta 
has paid particular attention to the 
most marginalized and often the least 
heard among us. From representing 
wrongfully convicted individuals as a 
young lawyer to her time in leadership 
roles at the ACLU, the Leadership Con-
ference, and the Department of Justice, 
Ms. Gupta has demonstrated her deep 
commitment to pursuing justice, eq-
uity, and equality for all people. 
In pursuit of that goal, Ms. Gupta has 
also demonstrated her desire and abil-
ity to work with anyone, including 
those who might normally disagree 
with her. Indeed, Ms. Gupta’s endorse-
ments from groups like the Fraternal 
Order of Police and individuals like 
Grover Norquist confirm that she is a 
thoughtful listener, a bridge builder, 
and a consensus seeker. 
In this charged political era, it is 
hard to imagine that any other nomi-
nee for Associate Attorney General 
could give my Republican colleagues 
more assurance that their views will be 
fairly considered at the Department of 
Justice. Yet, our Republican colleagues 
on the Judiciary Committee requested 
that Ms. Gupta’s nomination be indefi-
nitely stalled and that she be required 
to testify before the committee again. 
When those demands were rightfully 
declined, they chose to vote en bloc 
against referring Ms. Gupta’s nomina-
tion to the floor. 
But the opposition to Ms. Gupta’s 
nomination is, frankly, frivolous. For 4 
years now, the now-minority members 
of the Judiciary Committee refused to 
even comment on, let alone criticize, 
President Trump’s tweets antagonizing 
judges, Senators, everyday Americans, 
and so many others. Yet now they 
argue that Ms. Gupta’s occasionally 
impassioned tweets over the last 4 
years are somehow disqualifying, de-
spite her sincere apology, her expres-
sion of respect for Members of this 
body, and her promise to participate in 
turning down the rhetorical tempera-
ture. My Republican colleagues’ double 
standard could not be more clear. 
Similarly, our Republican colleagues 
spent the last 4 years hastily con-
firming judges and nominees who re-
fused to answer basic questions, like 
whether or not Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation was rightfully decided. Of course 
it was. But now they argue that more 
than 5 hours of testimony and 10,000 
pages of documents were not sufficient 
to evaluate Ms. Gupta, who repeatedly 
answered each and every one of their 
questions. Again, the double standard 
could not be more clear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2009 
April 19, 2021 
I could go on and on, but instead of 
continuing to point out the obvious hy-
pocrisy, let me say a few more words 
about why I am excited to have Ms. 
Gupta serve as the Associate Attorney 
General. 
For years now, civil rights, voting 
rights, environmental justice, immi-
grants’ rights, and consumer rights 
have found themselves as a second 
thought in the administration of our 
justice system. No longer. Under Ms. 
Gupta’s leadership, I look forward to 
seeing a Justice Department that pur-
sues equal justice for all of our citizens 
and that recognizes the dignity and hu-
manity of all people. 
I look forward to seeing Ms. Gupta 
work with Republicans and Democrats, 
with liberals and conservatives to find 
solutions to our problems, as she has 
throughout her career. And I look for-
ward to young girls and boys of color 
once again seeing someone who looks 
like them in the leadership of our Jus-
tice Department and knowing that one 
day, they, too, can reach such great 
heights. 
Colleagues, let’s not wait a moment 
longer. It is time for us to confirm Ms. 
Gupta as the next Associate Attorney 
General of the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

RECOGNIZING OFFICER JACOB 
CARLSON 
Ms. LUMMIS. Madam President, I 
rise to honor the true heroism of Offi-
cer Jacob Carlson of the Casper, WY, 
police department. On May 6, 2018, Offi-
cer Carlson risked his life to save his 
fellow officer and the lives of several 
young children when a routine traffic 
stop turned deadly. Every day, police 
officers must remain vigilant because, 
as we have seen, even routine enforce-
ment actions can go sideways at a mo-
ment’s notice. That happened to Offi-
cer Carlson, and his actions speak to 
his character. He put his life on the 
line to protect his fellow officer and his 
community. His courage is inspiring, 
and I am proud to call him a son of Wy-
oming. For this action, Officer Carlson 
has been awarded the Congressional 
Badge of Bravery, and it is a badge he 
earned. 
His years of service and dedication to 
the Casper Police Department were cut 
short by what happened, but Officer 
Carlson’s career of service as a police 
officer and former service in the U.S. 
Army is a legacy for which he can be 
proud. 
Officer Carlson is a remarkable ex-
ample of the highest caliber of law en-
forcement professionals. He is the hero 
we describe when we teach our children 
and grandchildren about the police of-
ficers who protect our communities. 
Officers such as Officer Carlson who 
protect our great State reinforce my 
belief that Wyoming truly is the best 
State in the Nation. When Americans 
want to see an example of how police 
officers should comport themselves, 
they can look upon Wyoming as the 
shining example. Officer Carlson’s ac-
tions on May 6, 2018, exemplify why. 
The State of Wyoming is blessed to 
have not only one brave officer deserv-
ing of this honor. The second officer is 
one of the people Officer Carlson pro-
tected in the face of adversity, Officer 
Randi Garrett, whose courage and her-
oism was also on display that day, is 
equally deserving and will be honored 
with a Congressional Badge of Bravery. 
My sincere thanks to Officer Carlson 
for making Casper and the State of Wy-
oming one of the greatest, safest places 
to live. 
RECOGNIZING OFFICER RANDI 
GARRETT 
Ms. LUMMIS. Madam President, I 
rise to honor Officer Randi Garrett, 
whose experience and skill and whose 
strong character helped save lives on 
May 6, 2018. 
Not only did Officer Garrett act with 
poise under intense pressure when a 
routine traffic stop turned violent, but 
while in immediate and real danger, 
she kept her focus on her mission, and 
helped to save the lives of two innocent 
children and the life of a fellow officer 
because of it. I shudder at the thought 
of what might have happened had Offi-
cer Garrett not acted with speed and 
purpose. 
Officer 
Garrett 
has 
been 
awarded the Congressional Badge of 
Bravery for her actions, and I am so 
proud of her for it. 
Officer Garrett is a shining example 
of what steadfast commitment, leader-
ship and decisionmaking under pres-
sure looks like. It is because of officers 
like Randi that the people of Casper 
can feel safe and secure in their com-
munity. 
As we approach the third anniversary 
of Officer Randi Garrett’s heroism, I 
know that her acts that day won’t be 
forgotten by the Casper community 
and by those whose lives she helped to 
save. For without them, it is unknown 
the tragedies that may have occurred. 
Instead, she serves as an example today 
to every young woman and girl inter-
ested in serving their community as an 
officer. I can think of no better exam-
ple for young women across the State 
of Wyoming to aspire to. 
Now, as she receives the Congres-
sional Badge of Bravery, I hope it 
serves as a reminder of a day when her 
courage was called upon and she an-
swered. This prestigious award is also 
being given to her counterpart who was 
there with her that day, Officer Jacob 
Carlson. Just as they faced danger to-
gether, this badge acts as yet another 
bond that the two of them will con-
tinue to share. 
My sincere thanks to Officer Garrett 
for her continued service and dedica-
tion to the city of Casper and our great 
State.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
KENTUCKY 
MUSIC HALL OF FAME AND MU-
SEUM 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, Ken-
tucky has a rich cultural history and is 
the birthplace of musical artists from 
every genre and era. Proudly show-
casing this heritage is the Kentucky 
Music Hall of Fame & Museum in 
Mount Vernon, KY. 
John Lee Lair, who served as a ser-
geant in the U.S. Army during WWII, 
returned to the States and joined WLS 
radio in Chicago, where he turned his 
lifelong love of music into a career. He 
founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance, 
which was broadcast by several power-
ful AM stations and eventually moved 
to its final home in Renfro Valley, KY. 
Today we honor one of John Lair’s 
three daughters, Ann Lair Henderson, 
who developed the plan to house the 
hall of fame and museum in the fam-
ily’s vintage horse stable. Following an 
act of the Kentucky General Assembly 
in 2002, this special tribute to Ken-
tucky’s storied musicians was born. 
The iconic building, which is listed 
on the National Register of Historic 
Places, is filled with memorabilia and 
tributes to over 60 artists as diverse as 
Rosemary Clooney, Ricky Skaggs, Lio-
nel Hampton, Boots Randolph, and 
Mary Travers. Nearly 20 years since its 
founding, Ann Lair Henderson, who re-
cently celebrated her 98th birthday, is 
still a vital part of the organization 
that helps recognize the enormous con-
tribution of Kentucky’s incredible mu-
sical talents. We are grateful for Ann’s 
passion for preserving history and for 
promoting 
some 
of 
the 
Common-
wealth’s finest treasures. She is a 
treasure in her own right to her local 
community and a great reminder for us 
all to keep pursuing those things about 
which we are truly passionate through 
every season of life.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, 
Ms. HIRONO, Mr. CARDIN, Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. 
SCHATZ, 
Mr. 
MURPHY, 
Mr. 
KAINE, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. BOOK-
ER, and Mr. VAN HOLLEN): 
S. 1201. A bill to restore the United 
States’ international leadership on cli-
mate change and clean energy, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak on the United 
States Climate Leadership on Inter-
national Mitigation, Adaptation, and 
Technology Enhancement Act of 2021— 
the U.S. CLIMATE Act. Mr. President, 
climate change represents a clear and 
present threat to the stability, secu-
rity and prosperity of nations around 
the world, including the United States. 
The cost of climate-induced disasters 
becomes more indisputable and dev-
astating with every passing year. Bar-
ring swift and ambitious action, the 
situation will only worsen. 
We’ve all seen the devastating im-
pacts of climate change. For years, un-
precedented tropical storms have de-
stroyed communities in Mozambique, 
Central 
America, 
and 
the 
United 
States, including communities in my 
home state of New Jersey. This past 
February, 
incredibly 
abnormal 
and 
brutal winter weather, exacerbated by 
climatic disruption to the Arctic’s 
polar vortex, killed eleven people and 
left thousands in Texas without power 
and water. Less than a year prior, 
deadly wildfires, exacerbated by cli-
mate change engulfed California, kill-
ing 31 people, and Australia, killing 34 
people, and forced thousands to flee 
their homes and lose their livelihoods. 
And yet, while hurricanes and storm 
surges are horrific, climate change is 
also increasing the intensity, length 
and geographic expanse of droughts 
around the world contributing to food 
insecurity, natural resource scarcity 
and desertification. 
Likewise, intensifying effects of cli-
mate change pose an existential threat 
to hundreds of millions of people and 
exacerbate global forced migration. 
Nations like Bangladesh, India, and In-
donesia are incredibly vulnerable to 
mass displacement due to rising sea 
levels. Island nations like Tuvalu, 
Seychelles, the Republic of the Mar-
shall Islands and Kiribati are already 
managing internal migration due to 
climate change induced sea-level rise. 
Without ambitious action to both keep 
global 
leverage 
temperatures 
well 
below an increase of two degrees Cel-
sius above preindustrial levels it is 
forecasted that the entirety of certain 
nations 
may 
become 
uninhabitable 
within my grandchildren’s lifetime. It 
is a moral imperative for the Senators 
in this body, and humanity, to act to 
ensure that is not the world we leave 
for the generations that will come 
after us. Today’s generations are the 
first people to personally and regularly 
experience 
the 
effects 
of 
climate 
change on the natural world and its 
impact on humanity . . . and we are 
also the last generations that can, and 
must, act to prevent the worst fore-
casts from becoming reality. 
Changing climate and weather pat-
terns intensification of global food in-
security and resource scarcity espe-
cially threaten the lives and security 
of the world’s most vulnerable popu-
lations. For months, heavy rainfall and 
warmer temperatures have triggered a 
locust plague in East Africa that has 
lasted more than an entire year. This 
historic locust plague—triggered by 
conditions 
exacerbated 
by 
climate 
change—has 
threatened 
agricultural 
and pastoral livelihoods and worsened 
already acute food insecurity in the re-
gion. At the same time, similar ex-
treme weather patterns are expected to 
expand and shift the ranges of life- 
threatening diseases like malaria, West 
Nile Virus, cholera, and others. Beyond 
the palpable destruction and devasta-
tion of climate-induced crises, climate 
change is a ‘‘threat multiplier,’’ a term 
coined by the CNA Corporation’s Mili-
tary Advisory Board in 2007 to express 
the way in which climate change exac-
erbates instability; conflict and subse-
quent displacement; terrorism; and 
other vital security matters. 
Clearly, climate change does not 
begin nor end at any nation’s borders. 
No one is immune to the effects of cli-
mate change—which is why we must 
not only work with the rest of the

April 19, 2021 
world to combat this crisis, but lead 
the charge. It is simply not enough to 
enact robust domestic policies—this is 
a global problem that requires inter-
nationally 
collaborative 
solutions. 
What’s more, our leadership and re-
newed international engagement can 
generate opportunities for Americans. 
By committing to international agree-
ments and adhering to emerging inter-
national production norms, we are 
opening the global markets for the in-
novation, ingenuity, and leadership of 
the American private sector. 
I commend the Biden administra-
tion’s commitment to returning the 
United States to the global stage, 
thereby granting us the capacity to re-
engage and lead the international com-
munity in tackling the greatest threat 
of our time. President Biden’s Execu-
tive Order on Tackling the Climate 
Crisis at Home and Abroad has des-
ignated climate action as a core tenant 
of U.S. diplomacy and national secu-
rity planning. He has appointed former 
Secretary of State John Kerry as Spe-
cial Presidential Envoy for Climate, 
ensuring that climate considerations 
have a strong advocate where impor-
tant decisions are being made. And, 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
President 
Biden, the United States has officially 
rejoined the Paris Agreement. 
The time for debate and discussion 
on why and how we must tackle this 
crisis is over. The science is clear: we 
must achieve net zero emissions by 2050 
in order to ensure a safe and pros-
perous future for ourselves and our pos-
terity. Now is the time for action and 
implementation of crucial efforts to 
save our planet. 
Congress can and must do more to 
support the restoration of the United 
States’ climate diplomacy and leader-
ship. That is why I am introducing the 
United States Climate Leadership in 
International Mitigation, Adaptation, 
and Technological Enhancement Act, 
or the U.S. CLIMATE Act, of 2021, a 
comprehensive piece of legislation to 
bolster President Biden’s bold commit-
ment to U.S. climate leadership by pro-
viding resources, programs and policy 
to support and expedite the realization 
of United States action that will be es-
sential to regaining the international 
community’s trust and partnership 
with the U.S. in the global climate 
fight. It represents a bold course of ac-
tion that Congress should take to sup-
port forward-looking leadership in the 
White House in their commitment to 
preventing the worst-case scenarios of 
climate change from becoming reality. 
Title I of the bill establishes climate 
change as a cross-cutting imperative at 
the State Department. It also calls for 
the integration of climate models and 
forecasting into national security plan-
ning across all federal agencies and 
features directives on protecting our 
security and environmental interests 
in the Arctic. 
Title II declares support for U.S. co-
operation and engagement in inter-
national agreements. This includes di-
rectives on re-entry into the Paris 
Agreements; ratification of the Kigali 
Amendment to the Montreal Protocols; 
compliance with environmental initia-
tives of the International Civil Avia-
tion Organization; and the establish-
ment of new international efforts to 
mitigate 
transportation 
sector 
and 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Title III integrates climate change 
mitigation and adaptation efforts into 
a range of tools and initiatives at 
USAID, the Department of the Treas-
ury, the Department of State, the DFC, 
and the United Nations. 
Title IV incorporates a clean energy 
mandate into the United States’ diplo-
matic and development efforts, thereby 
protecting our own energy security in-
terests and promoting responsible glob-
al energy production. 
Title V of the bill addresses the 
United States’ bilateral and multilat-
eral engagement on climate change, 
encouraging 
U.S. 
cooperation 
with 
China, India, the European Union and 
other key partners. 
Title VI of the U.S. CLIMATE Act in-
tegrates our colleague from Hawai’i, 
Senator HIRONO’s Women and Climate 
Change Act, which acknowledges and 
addresses the disproportionate effects 
of climate change on women and girls 
around the world. 
The science is clear: we are running 
out of time to stave off the most dev-
astating effects of climate change that 
will directly impact our children and 
our children’s children. After four 
years of being absent from the con-
versation, it is time for the United 
States to not only return to the table, 
but lead the charge to protect our 
shared home. We cannot solve this cri-
sis alone—this is not an American 
problem, this is a global crisis that can 
only be combatted with coordinated, 
international action. The U.S. CLI-
MATE Act of 2021 provides the essen-
tial resources, programs, and support 
for the United States to lead the world 
forward in the existential fight to save 
our planet. Mr. President I ask unani-
mous consent that the full text of the 
legislation be printed in the RECORD 
following my remarks, I yield the floor 
and note the absence of a quorum. 
So ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2015 
April 19, 2021 
(1) The Special Report: Global Warming of 
1.5°C, published by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change on October 8, 2018, 
and the Fourth National Climate Assess-
ment, first published by the United States 
Global Change Research Program in 2018, 
concluded that— 
(A) the release of greenhouse gas emis-
sions, most notably the combustion of fossil 
fuels and the degradation of natural re-
sources that absorb atmospheric carbon from 
human activity, are the dominant causes of 
climate change during the past century; 
(B) changes in the Earth’s climate are— 
(i) causing sea levels to rise; 
(ii) increasing the global average tempera-
ture of the Earth; 
(iii) increasing the incidence and severity 
of wildfires; and 
(iv) intensifying the severity of extreme 
weather, including hurricanes, cyclones, ty-
phoons, flooding, droughts, and other disas-
ters that threaten human life, healthy com-
munities, and critical infrastructure. 
(2) An increase in the global average tem-
perature of 2 degrees Celsius compared to 
pre-industrialized levels would cause— 
(A)(i) the displacement, and the forced in-
ternal migration, of an estimated 143,000,000 
people in Latin America, South Asia, and 
Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050 if insufficient ac-
tion is taken (according to the World Bank); 
and 
(ii) the displacement of an average of 
17,800,000 people worldwide by floods every 
year (according to the Internal Displacement 
Monitoring Centre) because of the exacer-
bating effects of climate change; 
(B)(i) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost an-
nual economic output in the United States (a 
10 percent contraction from 2018 levels) by 
2100 (according to the Fourth National Cli-
mate Assessment); and 
(ii) an additional 100,000,000 people world-
wide to be driven into poverty by 2030 (ac-
cording to the World Bank); 
(C)(i) greater food insecurity and decreased 
agricultural 
production 
due 
to 
climate 
change’s effects on the increased frequency 
and intensity of extreme weather events; and 
(ii) the proliferation of agricultural pests 
and crop diseases, loss of biodiversity, de-
grading ecosystems, and water scarcity (ac-
cording to the United Nations Food and Ag-
riculture Organization); and 
(D) more than 350,000,000 additional people 
worldwide to be exposed to deadly heat 
stress by 2050. 
(3) According to the International Mone-
tary Fund, a persistent annual increase in 
average global temperature of .04 degrees 
Celsius would reduce global real gross do-
mestic product per capita by 7.22 percent by 
2100. 
(4) According to the United Nations Envi-
ronment Programme, climate change is ex-
acerbating unusual regional weather condi-
tions, which is driving the current and pro-
longed desert locust outbreak that is threat-
ening food security across East Africa and 
Southeast Asia. 
(5) According to the Intergovernmental 
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services— 
(A) an increase in the global average tem-
perature of between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius 
will result in a significant reduction in the 
worldwide number of land species; 
(B) an increase in the global average tem-
perature of 2 degrees Celsius— 
(i) will place 5 percent of world’s species at 
risk of extinction; and 
(ii) will result in the destruction of more 
than 99 percent of all coral reefs worldwide; 
and 
(C) an increase in the global average tem-
perature of 4.3 degrees Celsius will place 16 
percent of world’s terrestrial species at risk 
of extinction. 
(6) According to the International Energy 
Agency, the United States, China, India, and 
the European Union (including the United 
Kingdom) account for more than 58 percent 
of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
(7) China, which is the world’s top green-
house gases emitter and has an outsized im-
pact on the United States’ core interest in 
climate stability— 
(A) is likely to achieve its carbon emis-
sions mitigation pledge to the Paris Agree-
ment, contained in its 2015 nationally deter-
mined contribution, to ‘‘peak’’ emissions 
around 2030 ahead of schedule; 
(B) announced, on September 22, 2020, a 
pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060; 
and 
(C) has yet to announce an updated nation-
ally determined contribution. 
(8) On October 26, 2020, Japan, the world’s 
third largest economy and fifth greatest car-
bon emitter, announced a pledge to achieve 
carbon neutrality by 2050. Despite apprehen-
sion about growing nuclear energy sources, 
Japan aims to increase its share of renew-
able and nuclear energy following new tar-
gets unveiled next year. 
(9) India has met its growing energy de-
mands by becoming a global leader in renew-
able energy generation. Despite significant 
investments in renewable energy, and the 
implementation of strong national green-
house gas mitigation policies, India con-
tinues to operate some of the world’s dirtiest 
fossil fuel power plants and has high emis-
sions generated from its transportation sec-
tor. India is a critical market for foreign in-
vestment and will be a major competitor in 
international clean energy development fu-
tures. 
(10) India’s leadership within the Clean En-
ergy Ministerial, the Mission Innovation ini-
tiative, and the International Solar Alliance 
has put India at the forefront of renewable 
energy development and helped India achieve 
a top 5 global rank among clean energy pro-
ducers. Installed electricity capacity from 
renewables in India grew by 144 percent be-
tween 
2014 
and 
2020. 
Approximately 
$42,000,000,000 was invested into India’s re-
newable energy sector between 2014 and 2019. 
(11) The European Union demonstrated its 
strong commitment to climate action by 
making the ambitious pledge to reduce the 
collective greenhouse gas emissions of its 27 
member nations by at least 55 percent by 
2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and to achieve 
carbon neutrality by 2050. The European Par-
liament went even further, voting to reduce 
its collective economy wide greenhouse gas 
emissions by 60 percent by 2030 (compared to 
1990 levels). These commitments represent 
substantial improvements from the previous 
goal of a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2030. 
(12) The European Union’s member nations 
have also provided the equivalent of approxi-
mately $120,000,000,000 between 2014 and 2020 
in support and financing to build climate 
change resilience and develop low carbon en-
ergy capacity throughout the developing 
world. 
(13) The European Union has traditionally 
been a steadfast partner with United States 
in the United Nation’s Framework Conven-
tion on Climate Change by pushing for im-
proved accountability, transparency, and 
shared responsibility among parties in miti-
gating global greenhouse gas emissions. As 
the United State Government’s executive 
branch has pulled away from climate action 
commitments, the European Union has in-
creased its cooperation with coalitions of 
States through partnerships such as the 
United States Climate Alliance. 
(14) Among the world’s top greenhouse gas 
emitters, the United States is the only coun-
try that— 
(A) has rescinded national policies to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions; 
(B) has advanced policies aimed at bol-
stering fossil fuel consumption and extrac-
tion, including through the removal of Fed-
eral protections of public lands that are crit-
ical wilderness areas vital to maintaining 
healthy natural ecosystems; and 
(C) has abstained or withdrawn itself from 
several global cooperative efforts acknowl-
edging and addressing the climate crisis. 
(15) United States leadership during delib-
erations over the Paris Agreement— 
(A) was exemplified by— 
(i) its commitment to reduce national 
emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 lev-
els; 
(ii) its leadership in the ‘‘Umbrella Group’’ 
and its role as cofounder of the ‘‘High Ambi-
tion Coalition’’; 
(iii) its co-facilitation of the UNFCCC; 
(iv) its work with the Ad Hoc Working 
Group on the Paris Agreement on agenda 
item 5: Modalities, procedures and guidelines 
for the transparency framework for action; 
and 
(v) its support for the enhanced trans-
parency framework for action and support 
referred to in Article 13 of the Paris Agree-
ment; 
(vi) its pledge of $3,000,000,000 to the Green 
Climate Fund (of which the United States 
still owed $2,000,000,000) in support of devel-
oping countries’ efforts to adapt to climate 
change and to mitigate greenhouse gas emis-
sions; and 
(vii) the development of critical bilateral 
climate action cooperation initiatives with 
China and India; and 
(B) established the United States as essen-
tial to uniting the world in climate action 
cooperation. 
(16) The United States’ reversal on nearly 
all climate action policies since 2017, includ-
ing repealing the Clean Power Plan (an-
nounced by President Obama in August 2015), 
cancelling contributions to the United Na-
tion’s Green Climate Fund, abstaining from 
all G7 and G20 climate action communiques, 
and withdrawing the United States from the 
Paris Agreement— 
(A) undermines the viability of the Paris 
Agreement; 
(B) harms American diplomacy; 
(C) disadvantages the ability of the United 
State private sector to compete in a clean 
energy global economy, for which the Inter-
national Finance Corporation estimates that 
investments spurred by the Paris Agreement 
will creates up to $23,000,000,000,000 in new in-
vestment opportunities; 
(D) erodes the United States’ leadership, 
standing, and trust within the international 
community; and 
(E) concedes leadership and economic op-
portunity to foreign governments keen on 
taking advantage of the United States’ ab-
sence from international climate action ini-
tiatives. 
(17) The Paris Agreement’s central aim is— 
(A) to strengthen the global response to 
the threat of climate change by maintaining 
the global temperature rise well below 2 de-
grees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; and 
(B) to pursue efforts to further limit the 
temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
(18) The Paris Agreement— 
(A) specifies the need for a strong global 
response to climate change; 
(B) 
acknowledges 
that 
all 
‘‘[p]arties 
should, when taking action to address cli-
mate change, respect, promote and consider 
their respective obligations on human rights, 
the right to health, the rights of indigenous

peoples, local communities, migrants, chil-
dren, persons with disabilities and people in 
vulnerable situations and the right to devel-
opment, as well as gender equality, em-
powerment of women and intergenerational 
equity’’; 
(C) notes the importance of ‘‘climate jus-
tice’’ when mitigating and adapting to cli-
mate change; 
(D) recognizes ‘‘the need for an effective 
and progressive response to the urgent 
threat of climate change’’; 
(E) requires all parties to put forward their 
best efforts through nationally determined 
contributions and to strengthen these efforts 
in the future; 
(F) requires each party to update its na-
tionally determined contribution every 5 
years, with each successive nationally deter-
mined contribution representing a progres-
sion beyond the previous nationally deter-
mined contribution, and reflecting the par-
ty’s highest possible ambition; 
(G) recognizes that marine ecosystems cov-
ering more than 70 percent of the Earth’s 
surface have an integral role in climate bal-
ance; and 
(H) was developed under the UNFCCC, an 
international environmental treaty which 
the United States ratified, with the advice 
and consent of the Senate on October 15, 
1992. 
(19) Seventy percent of the Paris Agree-
ment 
signatories’ 
nationally 
determined 
contributions in support of the goals of the 
Paris Agreement are ocean-inclusive, and 39 
Paris Agreement signatories are focused on 
the inclusion of ocean action in nationally 
determined contributions through the Be-
cause the Ocean initiative. 
(20) The United States communicated its 
nationally determined contribution— 
(A) to achieve, by 2025, an economy-wide 
target of reducing its greenhouse gas emis-
sions by 26 to 28 percent below its 2005 level; 
and 
(B) to make best efforts to reduce its emis-
sions by 28 percent. 
(21) A thriving clean energy industry in the 
United States, which employs more than 
500,000 Americans, is essential in achieving 
these targets. 
(22) A number of existing laws and regula-
tions in the United States also are relevant 
to achieving this target, including— 
(A) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et 
seq.); 
(B) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public 
Law 102–486); and 
(C) the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–140). 
(23) On November 4, 2020, the United States 
withdrawal from the Paris Agreement be-
came effective, which at the time resulted in 
the United States being the only state party 
(out of 197 parties) to the UNFCCC that is 
not a party to the Paris Agreement. 
(24) On January 20, 2021, President Biden 
initiated the process for reentering the 
United States into the Paris Agreement. On 
February 19, 2021, the United States offi-
cially rejoined the Paris Agreement. 
(25) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement 
states, ‘‘Parties recognize the importance of 
averting, minimizing and addressing loss and 
damage associated with the adverse effects 
of climate change, including extreme weath-
er events and slow onset events, and the role 
of sustainable development in reducing the 
risk of loss and damage.’’ Such adverse ef-
fects include strong winds from hurricanes 
and tropical storms, and flooding from storm 
surges and heavy rain, that inflict losses on 
various sectors of the United States econ-
omy. 
(26) The Paris Agreement requires that 
parties ‘‘should strengthen their cooperation 
on enhancing action on adaptation, taking 
into account the Cancun Adaptation Frame-
work’’, which includes measures to enhance 
understanding, coordination and cooperation 
with regard to climate change induced dis-
placement, migration and planned reloca-
tion, where appropriate, at the national, re-
gional and international levels. 
(27) The Paris Agreement is an example of 
the multilateral, international cooperation 
needed to overcome climate change-related 
challenges facing the global community, 
such as reducing emissions, promoting eco-
nomic growth, and deploying clean energy 
technologies. 
(28) The Paris Agreement recognizes ‘‘the 
fundamental priority of safeguarding food 
security and ending hunger, and the par-
ticular vulnerabilities of food production 
systems to the adverse impacts of climate 
change.’’. 
(29) The Paris Agreement recognizes that— 
(A) adaptation is a global challenge facing 
all countries, with local, subnational, na-
tional, regional, and international dimen-
sions; and 
(B) adapting to the effects of climate 
change is a key component of the long-term 
global response to climate change to protect 
people, livelihoods, and ecosystems. 
(30) American leadership during the Paris 
Agreement negotiations encouraged wide-
spread international participation in the 
Paris Agreement. 
(31) American States, cities, and businesses 
are stepping up and pledging to meet the 
Paris Agreement goals in the wake of absent 
and uncertain leadership by the President. 
(32) The Paris Agreement— 
(A) has driven innovation in developing 
cleaner, more reliable, and more affordable 
forms of energy; 
(B) has demonstrated that addressing cli-
mate change and providing affordable energy 
to American consumers are not mutually ex-
clusive; and 
(C) has encouraged the United States to de-
velop the Mid-Century Strategy for Deep 
Decarbonization, which— 
(i) was released on November 16, 2016; and 
(ii) states, ‘‘Energy efficiency improve-
ments enable the energy system to provide 
the services we need with fewer resources 
and emissions. Over the past several years, 
the United States has demonstrated that 
programs and standards to improve the en-
ergy efficiency of buildings, appliances and 
vehicles can cost-effectively cut carbon pol-
lution and lower energy bills, while main-
taining significant support from U.S. indus-
try and consumers.’’. 
(33) Global temperatures must be kept 
below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industri-
alized levels to avoid the most severe im-
pacts of a changing climate, which will re-
quire— 
(A) global reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions from human sources of 40 to 60 
percent from 2010 levels by 2030; and 
(B) net-zero global emissions by 2050; 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) when the United States proffers a 
strong commitment and focused leadership 
on climate action, the rest of the world will 
likely follow its example; 
(2) when the United States abdicates lead-
ership on such matters, other countries are 
likely to waiver on their commitments to 
action and retract to insular posturing on 
matters that require cooperation; and 
(3) in order to avert the worst impacts of 
climate change, which is in the core national 
interest of the United States, the United 
States should— 
(A) prioritize climate change in its foreign 
policy, and ensure that climate change is 
taken into account in all foreign policy deci-
sion making; 
(B) set the standard for ambition on cli-
mate action; 
(C) use its diplomatic leverage to create in-
centives for other countries to take strong 
action on climate change; 
(D) broker, with other world powers, bilat-
eral commitments on emissions reductions 
and climate finance and support for devel-
oping countries, which are critical for— 
(i) building trust and consensus around 
global cooperation on climate action; and 
(ii) sending important investment signals 
to private finance and private industry on 
investment and development trends; 
(E) be transparent in how the United 
States is delivering on its commitments; 
(F) ensure it is adopting and implementing 
consistent policies and practices with re-
spect to climate change across bilateral and 
multilateral development finance institu-
tions; 
(G) hold other world powers accountable 
for making and meeting strong commit-
ments; 
(H) call for reciprocal standards of trans-
parency; and 
(I) support developing countries, in an in-
clusive manner— 
(i) to expand deployment and access to 
clean energy; 
(ii) to plan and invest in climate change 
adaptation solutions; 
(iii) to improve climate change resilience 
capacities; and 
(iv) to promote— 
(I) sustainable agriculture practices; 
(II) food security; and 
(III) natural resource conservation. 
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to provide au-
thorities, 
resources, 
policies, 
and 
rec-
ommended administrative actions— 
(1) to restore United States global leader-
ship on addressing the climate crisis and 
make United States climate action and cli-
mate diplomacy a more central tenet of 
United States foreign policy; 
(2) to improve the United States’ commit-
ment to taking more ambitious action to 
help mitigate global greenhouse gas emis-
sion and improve developing countries’ resil-
ience and adaptation capacities to the ef-
fects of climate change; 
(3) to reclaim, accept, and fully engage di-
plomacy within a variety of current and out-
standing multilateral institutions that the 
United States has withdrawn, withheld sup-
port, or diminished meaningful engagement 
from in recent years; 
(4) to encourage the pursuit of new bilat-
eral cooperation agreements with other 
world powers on initiatives to advance global 
clean energy innovation and deployment and 
other measures to mitigate global green-
house gas emissions and improve climate 
change adaptation capacities; 
(5) to ensure that the United States’ na-
tional security apparatus integrates criti-
cally important data on the compounding ef-
fects that climate change is having on global 
security risks by enhancing our under-
standing of how, where, and when such ef-
fects are destabilizing countries and regions 
in ways that may motivate conflict, dis-
placement, and other drivers of insecurity; 
and 
(6) to authorize funding and programs to 
support a reaffirmation of the United States’ 
commitments to international cooperation 
and support for developing and vulnerable 
countries to take climate action.

SEC. 203. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RATI-
FICATION OF THE KIGALI AMEND-
MENT 
TO 
THE 
MONTREAL 
PRO-
TOCOL. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The chemical refrigerant alternative, 
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), and its chemical 
derivatives identified in Annex F of the Mon-
treal Protocol on Substances that Deplete 
the Ozone Layer, done at Montreal Sep-
tember 
16, 
1987, 
which 
replaced 
hydrochlorofluorocarbon 
(HCFC) 
and 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), are short-lived 
and highly potent greenhouse gases. 
(2) Some HFCs are 4,000 times more potent 
greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The 
expansion of mass production and worldwide 
use of HFCs have significantly contributed 
to the recent worsening of the global climate 
crisis. 
(3) In October 15, 2016, the parties at the 
28th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Pro-
tocol, with the support of the United States, 
adopted an amendment (referred to in the 
Act as the ‘‘Kigali Amendment’’) to the Mon-
treal Protocol to globally phase down the 
production 
and 
application 
of 
hydrofluorocarbons, most commonly used as 
refrigerants in air conditioners and for cold 
storage. 
(4) The Kigali Amendment calls for parties 
to cut the production and consumption of 
HFCs by more than 80 percent during a 30- 
year period— 
(A) to eliminate an estimated 80,000,000,000 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent 
emissions by 2050; and 
(B) to avoid up to 0.5 degree Celsius warm-
ing by the end of the century, while con-
tinuing to protect the ozone layer. 
(5) United States’ ratification of the Kigali 
Amendment will require the advice and con-
sent of the Senate. There is broad bipartisan 
support for the Kigali Amendment in the 
Senate, as evidenced by a letter sent by 13 
Republican senators to the President on 
June 4, 2018, urging the President to submit 
the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for ad-
vice and consent. 
(6) The Environmental Protection Agency 
received sufficient domestic legal authority 
to comply with the international obligations 
of the Kigali Amendment under title II of 
the Department of the Interior, Environ-
ment, and Related Agencies Appropriations 
Act, 2021 (division G of Public Law 116–260), 
which was enacted on December 27, 2020. 
(7) As of the date of the introduction of the 
Act, the President has not submitted the 
Kigali Amendment to the Senate for advice

April 19, 2021 
and consent and the United States Govern-
ment has neither ratified nor implemented 
policies to comply with the Kigali Amend-
ment. 
(8) The Kigali Amendment, which has been 
ratified by 100 parties, entered into force on 
January 1, 2019. 
(9) Adoption of the Kigali Amendment and 
United States’ ratification of and compli-
ance with the Kigali Amendment is sup-
ported broadly by affected industry stake-
holders and environmental public interest 
organizations. 
(10) Industries in the United States that 
use and produce fluorocarbons— 
(A) contribute more than $158,000,000,000 
annually in goods and services to the econ-
omy of the United States; and 
(B) employ more than 700,000 individuals, 
with an annual industry-wide payroll of 
more than $32,000,000,000. 
(11) Foreign competitors to United States 
chemical refrigerant and refrigeration equip-
ment based and operating in countries that 
have ratified the Kigali Amendment and are 
implementing policies in compliance with 
the Kigali Amendment are gaining an advan-
tage on United States based industries in the 
manufacturing and used of next-generation 
chemicals and equipment. 
(12) The United States’ ratification of the 
Kigali Amendment— 
(A) would support and promote the techno-
logical leadership of the United States’ in-
dustries to lead global production and mar-
keting 
of 
replacement 
refrigerants 
and 
equipment in compliance with the Kigali 
Amendment; and 
(B) according to industry analysis, would 
potentially create approximately 33,000 new 
manufacturing jobs in the United States and 
add approximately $12,500,000,000 per year to 
the economy of the United States. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the President should immediately sub-
mit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for 
advice and consent; and 
(2) the Senate should promptly provide its 
advice and consent on the Kigali Amend-
ment. 
SEC. 204. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CARBON OFF-
SET AND REDUCTION SCHEME FOR 
INTERNATIONAL AVIATION. 
The Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall promulgate regulations 
establishing uniform policies and take other 
necessary actions to implement the terms of 
the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation (commonly known as 
‘‘CORSIA’’), which was adopted by Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization in Oc-
tober 2016 as Assembly Resolution A39-3, and 
any amendments to such Resolution with 
which the United States concurs, as means 
to secure a single global carbon emissions 
market-based mechanism to facilitate the 
participation of operators of civil aircraft of 
the United States in international aviation. 
SEC. 205. SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) HIGH-GWP HFC.—The term ‘‘high-GWP 
HFC’’ 
means 
newly

potential calculated over a 100-year period of 
greater than 150, as described in the Fifth 
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change. 
(2) SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS.—The 
term 
‘‘short-lived 
climate 
pollutants’’ 
means— 
(A) black carbon; 
(B) methane; and

the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agri-
culture) to use the voice, vote, and influence 
of the United States, consistent with the 
broad foreign policy goals of the United 
States, to advocate that each such body or 
conference— 
(1) commit to significantly increasing ef-
forts to reduce short-lived climate pollut-
ants; 
(2) invest in and develop alternative energy 
sources, industrial and agricultural proc-
esses, appliances, and products to replace 
sources of short-lived climate pollutants;

(C) climate assessment, scientific research, 
monitoring, and technological development 
activities; 
(5) develop and implement clear, account-
able, and metric-based targets to measure 
the effectiveness of projects described in 
paragraph (4); and 
(6) engage international partners in an ex-
isting multilateral forum (or, if necessary, 
establish through an international agree-
ment a new multilateral forum) to improve 
global cooperation for— 
(A) creating tangible metrics for evalu-
ating efforts to reduce short-lived climate 
pollutants; 
(B) developing and implementing best 
practices for phasing out sources of short- 
lived climate pollutants, including expand-
ing capacity for innovative instruments to 
mitigate short-lived climate pollutants at 
the national and subnational levels of for-
eign countries, particularly countries with 
little capacity to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and deploy clean energy facilities, 
and countries that lack sufficient policies to

SEC. 206. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION RE-
GARDING CLEAN TRANSPORTATION 
AND SUSTAINABLE LAND USE AND 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Agriculture, forestry, and other land 
use accounted for 24 percent of global green-
house gas emissions during 2010, which— 
(A) is caused primarily from agriculture 
(cultivation of crops and livestock) and de-
forestation; and 
(B) does not take into account the carbon 
dioxide that ecosystems remove from the at-
mosphere by sequestering carbon in biomass, 
dead organic matter, and soils, which offset 
approximately 20 percent of emissions from 
this sector. 
(2) The transportation sector accounts for 
14 percent of global gas emissions and 28 per-
cent of the United States’ greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
(3) According to the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information’s report, ‘‘Na-
tional Mitigation Potential from Natural 
Climate Solutions in the Tropics’’— 
(A) better land stewardship is needed to 
achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature 
goal of holding the increase of global average 
temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius, 
particularly in the tropics; 
(B) as countries enhance their nationally 
determined contributions, confusion persists 
about the potential contribution of better 
land stewardship to meeting such goal; 
(C) in 50 percent of the tropical countries, 
cost-effective 
natural 
climate 
solutions 
could mitigate more than 50 percent of na-
tional emissions; 
(D) in more than 25 percent of the tropical 
countries, cost effective natural climate so-
lutions potential is greater than national 
emissions; and 
(E) natural climate solutions can trans-
form national economies and contribute to 
sustainable development goals. 
(4) According to the International Energy 
Agency— 
(A) global transport emissions increased by 
less than 0.5 percent in 2019 (compared with 
an average annual increase of 1.9 percent 
since 2000), owing to efficiency improve-
ments, electrification, and greater use of 
biofuels; 
(B) transportation is responsible for 24 per-
cent of direct carbon dioxide emissions from 
fossil fuel combustion; 
(C) electric car deployment has grown rap-
idly since 2010, with the global stock of elec-
tric passenger cars passing 5,000,000 in 2018 
(an increase of 63 percent from the previous 
year); 
(D) in 2018— 
(i) approximately 45 percent of all electric 
cars on the road were in China; 
(ii) approximately 24 percent of such cars 
were in Europe; and 
(iii) approximately 22 percent of such cars 
were in the United States; 
(E) existing measures to increase effi-
ciency and reduce energy demand must be 
deepened and extended for compliance with 
the Sustainable Development Scenario of the 
International Energy Agency’s World Energy 
Model; 
(F) prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, emis-
sions from aviation and shipping were in-
creasing faster than all other transportation 
modes; and 
(G) energy demand and emissions have con-
tinued to rise in all modes of road transport 
(cars, trucks, buses, and 2- and 3-wheelers), 
particularly 
in 
heavy-duty 
road 
freight 
transport, which account for 75 percent of 
global transportation sector emissions. 
(5) The worldwide market share of sport 
utility vehicles rose 15 percentage points be-
tween 2014 and 2019, and now comprises 40 
percent of the global light-duty vehicle mar-
ket. 
(6) China is the world’s largest automobile 
market, with more than 23,700,000 light vehi-
cles sold in China in 2018. As China’s road 
network rapidly continues to expand, the 
number of vehicle miles traveled per capita 
will most likely lead to growth in China’s 
transportation sector carbon dioxide emis-
sions. 
(7) Even with India’s advancement of poli-
cies 
to 
promote 
electric 
vehicles 
and 
biofuels— 
(A) India relies heavily on oil, and com-
prises 29 percent of India’s total energy con-
sumption; 
(B) prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, India 
was the world’s fastest growing aviation 
market, with passenger numbers for domes-
tic and international flights doubling since 
2010; 
(C) India is planning to build 100 new air-
ports between 2020 and 2035, and industry an-
alysts have projected up to 520,000,000 Indian 
air travelers annually by 2037; and 
(D) the World Health Organization reports 
that 15 of the cities worldwide with the worst 
air pollution are in India, largely due to 
urban vehicle emissions. 
(8) In 2013, Mexico became the first vehicle 
market in Latin America to establish fuel 
economy or carbon dioxide emissions stand-
ards. 
(9) The Department of State, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and 
the Environmental Protection Agency do not 
have a program in place to encourage other 
countries to adopt standards that are com-
patible with United States fuel economy and 
emissions standards. 
(10) Many countries adopt European emis-
sions standards rather than United States 
standards, in part because of European diplo-
matic engagement, disadvantaging United 
States automakers in international markets. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to partner, consult, and 
coordinate with foreign governments, civil 
society, international financial institutions, 
subnational communities, agribusiness and 
automobile industry leaders, and the private 
sector in a concerted effort— 
(1) to raise awareness of— 
(A) the greenhouse gas emission contribu-
tions from agriculture, forestry, other land 
uses, and the transportation sector to the 
annual total of anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions globally; and 
(B) the importance of working coopera-
tively on the development of multi-faceted 
and country specific policies and strategies— 
(i) to effectively reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions from agriculture, forestry, other 
land uses, and the transportation sector; and 
(ii) to promote economic growth, opportu-
nities, sustainable land management, and eq-
uitable access to mobility, transportation

SEC. 207. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED 
STATES REENGAGEMENT WITH THE 
GROUP OF SEVEN AND THE GROUP 
OF TWENTY ON CLIMATE ACTION. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) President Trump has abstained from 
several heads of state meetings on climate 
action and cooperation with the heads of 
state from countries comprising the Group of 
Seven (referred to in this section as the 
‘‘G7’’) and the Group of Twenty (referred to 
in this section as the ‘‘G20’’). 
(2) The G7 summit held in Charlevoix, Que-
bec in June 2018 produced a climate action 
communique that was signed by the heads of 
state from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, and the United Kingdom, but was not 
signed by the United States. 
(3) The G7 climate action communique 
states, ‘‘Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the Euro-
pean Union reaffirm their strong commit-
ment to implement the Paris Agreement, 
through ambitious climate action, in par-
ticular through reducing emissions while 
stimulating innovation, enhancing adaptive 
capacity, strengthening and financing resil-
ience and reducing vulnerability; as well as 
ensuring a just transition, including increas-
ing efforts to mobilize climate finance from 
a wide variety of sources.’’. 
(4) In 2019, the United States blocked the 
G7 from making any new or additional com-
mitments on climate change, to the ex-
pressed disappointment and frustration of 
the other six heads of state. 
(5) The G7, without the active participa-
tion of the United States, continues to work 
together to fulfill clean energy commit-
ments on initiatives such as the 2014 Rome 
Initiative for Energy Security, the 2015 Ham-
burg Initiative for Sustainable Energy Secu-
rity, the 2016 Kitakyushu Initiative on En-
ergy Security for Global Growth, and the Af-
rica Renewable Energy Initiative. However, 
United States objections to global coopera-
tive climate action have prevented the G7 
from undertaking new clean energy and cli-
mate action initiatives in recent years. 
(6) The 2018 Buenos Aires Leaders Declara-
tion by the G20— 
(A) recognizes the risks that climate 
change poses to global security, global 
health, and economic development; and 
(B) affirms the significance of the Paris 
Agreement. 
(7) The United States insisted on the inclu-
sion of a statement in the G20 Buenos Aires 
Leaders Declaration, for which the United 
States was the only subscriber, expressing 
dissenting opinions on international climate 
action cooperation and equivocation on ‘‘uti-
lizing all energy sources and technologies, 
while protecting the environment’’. 
(8) In 2019, the G20 narrowly avoided con-
cluding without a leaders’ declaration, when 
the President unsuccessfully tried to pres-
sure the other 19 heads of state to weaken 
commitments on combating climate change 
in the 2019 G20 Osaka Leaders Declaration, 
leaving the United States to provide a dis-
senting provision articulating its outlier po-
sition on climate action in the Declaration. 
(b) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the President, acting through the Secretary 
of State, shall initiate a China-focused agen-
da at the G7, with respect to— 
(1) trade and investment issues and en-
forcement; 
(2) establishing and promulgating inter-
national infrastructure standards; 
(3) the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong; 
(4) human rights concerns in Xinjiang, 
Tibet, and other areas in the People’s Repub-
lic of China; 
(5) the security of 5G telecommunications; 
(6) anti-competitive behavior; 
(7) coercive and indentured international 
finance and conditional provision of foreign 
assistance; 
(8) international influence campaigns; 
(9) climate change; 
(10) China’s domestic and international in-
vestments in new coal power plants; 
(11) environmental standards; and 
(12) coordination with like-minded regional 
partners, including the Republic of Korea 
and Australia. 
(c) BRIEFING
ON
PROGRESS
OF
NEGOTIA-
TIONS.—Not later than 1 year after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the President 
shall provide a briefing to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House 
of Representatives regarding the progress of 
any negotiations described in subsection (b). 
(d) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should— 
(1) in the next G7 communique and G20 
Leaders’ Declaration— 
(A) renounce the United States contrarian 
positions on climate change expressed in the 
2018 and 2019 official documents of the G7 and 
G20 summits; 
(B) renew its commitment to climate co-
operation and support for fulfilling the goals 
of the Paris Agreement in the context of the 
G7 and the G20; 
(C) lead efforts to formalize new mecha-
nisms and commitments to climate action 
cooperation between the heads of state of the 
G7 and of the G20, which are aimed at— 
(i) increasing ambition on greenhouse gas 
mitigation; and 
(ii) strengthening support for climate fi-
nance in developing countries, particularly 
countries that are most vulnerable to the ef-
fects of climate change; and 
(D) challenge the heads of state of the G7 
and the G20 to leverage private financing and 
increase grants and official development as-
sistance in clean energy and sustainable de-
velopment projects in their own countries 
and in developing countries, especially coun-
tries that are most vulnerable to the effects 
of climate change; and 
(2) initiate the China-focused agenda de-
scribed in subsection (b) at the G7.

SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED 
STATES 
ENGAGEMENTS 
AT 
THE 
WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) In 2020, the World Economic Forum (re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘WEF’’) in 
Davos, Switzerland, put addressing the cli-
mate crisis at the top of its agenda. World 
and business leaders reinforced the need for 
urgent action to avoid human destruction 
from the clear and present climate crisis. 
(2) At the 2020 annual meeting of the WEF, 
the President, accompanied by the Secretary 
of the Treasury, delivered a contrarian mes-
sage, claiming, ‘‘To embrace the possibilities 
of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial 
prophets of doom and their predictions of the 
apocalypse.’’. 
(3) Nevertheless, the WEF, without support 
from the United States, announced climate 
initiatives on sustainable markets, reaching 
carbon neutrality on insurance investment 
portfolios, decarbonizing the automotive sec-
tor 
through 
circular 
economies, 
and 
transitioning to healthier, more sustainable 
food systems. 
(4) The one initiative the United States did 
agree to join is the Trillion Tree Campaign, 
which aims to grow, restore, and conserve 1 
trillion trees by 2030. 
(5) The President’s dismissal of the threat 
climate change poses to economic growth 
and global security has isolated the United 
States from the 117 represented countries at 
the WEF that support its climate agenda and 
are accelerating their national commitments 
in other international fora to address cli-
mate change. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that at the 2021 WEF, or at an ap-
propriate time and venue as early as possible 
in 2021— 
(1) the Secretary of State should commit 
to restoring diplomatic engagement and co-
operation on mobilizing investment and sup-
port for growing the global economy while 
achieving net zero global greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050; 
(2) the Secretary of the Treasury should 
announce— 
(A) the intention of the United States Gov-
ernment to divest from future investment 
and support for fossil fuel energy and extrac-
tion projects in developing countries; and 
(B) the establishment of an international 
clean energy private finance fund to support 
the development of large-scale renewable en-
ergy projects in middle income countries; 
(3) the Chief Executive Officer of the 
United States International Development Fi-
nance Corporation should commit to— 
(A) divesting the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation 
from future fossil fuel energy development 
and extraction projects; and 
(B) investing a significant portion of the 
annual portfolio of the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation 
in clean energy development projects; and 
(4) the Administrator of the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
should commit to prioritizing building resil-
ience and adaption capacities in the most 
climate-vulnerable countries.

greenhouse gas emissions, develop and de-
ploy energy generation technologies, and in-
tegrate sustainable adaptation solutions to 
the inevitable effects of climate change; 
(3) given the volume of China’s greenhouse 
gas emissions and the scientific imperative 
to swiftly reduce global greenhouse gas 
emissions to net-zero emissions around 2050, 
China should— 
(A) revise its long-term pledge; 
(B) seek to immediately peak its emis-
sions; 
(C) begin reducing its greenhouse gas emis-
sions significantly to meet a more ambitious 
long-term 2050 reductions target; and 
(D) update its nationally determined con-
tribution along a trajectory that aligns with 
achieving a more ambitious net-zero by 2050 
emissions target; 
(4) it is in the United States’ national in-
terest to prioritize climate change in its bi-
lateral engagement with China, as global cli-
mate risks cannot be mitigated without a 
significant reduction in Chinese domestic 
and overseas emissions; 
(5) the United States and China, to the ex-
tent practicable, should coordinate on mak-
ing and delivering ambitious pledges to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions, with aspira-
tions towards achieving net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2050; 
(6) the United States and its allies should 
work together, using diplomatic and eco-
nomic tools, to hold China accountable for 
any failure by China— 
(A) to increase ambition in its 2030 nation-
ally determined contribution, in line with 
net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 be-
fore the 26th Conference of the Parties to the 
UNFCCC scheduled for November 2021 and 
meeting a more ambitious nationally deter-
mined contribution; 
(B) to work faithfully to uphold the prin-
ciples, goals, and rules of the Paris Agree-
ment; 
(C) to avoid and prohibit efforts to under-
mine or devolve the Paris Agreement’s rule 
or underlying framework, particularly with-
in areas of accountability transparency, and 
shared responsibility among all parties; 
(D) to eliminate greenhouse gas intensive 
projects from China’s Belt and Road Initia-
tive and other overseas investments, includ-
ing— 
(i) working with allies and partners of the 
United States to eliminate support for coal 
power production projects in China’s Belt 
and Road Initiative; 
(ii) providing financing and project support 
for cleaner and less risky alternatives; and 
(iii) undertaking ‘‘parallel initiatives’’ to 
enhance capacity building programs and 
overseas sustainable investment criteria, in-
cluding in areas such as integrated energy 
planning, power sector reform, just transi-
tion, distributed generation, procurement, 
transparency, and standards to support low- 
emissions growth in developing countries; 
and 
(E) to phase out existing coal power plants 
and reduce net coal power production; 
(7) the United States should pursue con-
fidence-building opportunities for the United 
States and China to undertake ‘‘parallel ini-
tiatives’’ on clean energy research, develop-
ment, finance, and deployment, including 
through economic and stimulus measures 
with clear, mutually agreed upon rules and 
policies to protect intellectual property, en-
sure equitable, nonpunitive provision of sup-
port, and verify implementation, which 
would provide catalytic progress towards de-
livering 
a 
global 
clean 
energy 
trans-
formation that benefits all people; and 
(8) the United States should pursue cooper-
ative initiatives to shift toward the import 
and consummation of forest and agricultural 
commodities that are produced in a manner 
that does not contribute to deforestation.

investments in developing countries that 
support low carbon economic development 
and promote climate change resiliency and 
adaptation 
(2) PARTNERSHIP FUND.—The Chief Execu-
tive Officer of the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation 
should partner with the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development to create a 
fund or multilateral financing mechanism to 
support clean energy development and cli-
mate change adaptation and resilience ac-
tivities in developing countries. 
(3) RESPONSE TO THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA’S
BELT
AND
ROAD
INITIATIVE.—The

States and India on the development and de-
ployment of clean energy technologies has 
resulted in innovative new technologies that 
have helped significantly lower the carbon 
emissions of the power sector in India; and 
(5) since demand for energy in India will 
increase with the expansion of the economy 
and middle class of India, it is in the interest 
of United States national security and global 
security for the United States to support 
India in growing the energy sector of India 
in environmentally and socially responsible 
ways that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions 
and improve the climate security of India.

Development, under the direction of the Sec-
retary of State, shall appoint a Coordinator 
for Power Africa, who shall serve in the Bu-
reau Economic Growth, Education, and the 
Environment of the United States Agency 
for International Development. 
‘‘(b) DUTIES.—The Coordinator for Power 
Africa shall— 
‘‘(1) be primarily located at a mission in 
sub-Saharan Africa; 
‘‘(2) lead— 
‘‘(A) the execution of the Power Africa Ini-

SEC. 506. CARIBBEAN ENERGY INITIATIVE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The countries of the Caribbean are 
heavily reliant upon imported oil to provide 
for approximately 90 percent of their energy 
production. 
(2) The level of dependence is even higher 
including— 
(A) Jamaica, which relies on oil for 95.9 
percent of its electricity; 
(B) Barbados, which relies on oil for 96 per-
cent of its electricity; 
(C) The Virgin Islands, which relies on oil 
for nearly 100 percent of its electricity; and 
(D) St. Lucia, which relies on oil for 100 
percent of its electricity. 
(3) Overreliance on imported fossil fuels 
has had a detrimental effect on economic de-
velopment, growth, and competitiveness in 
the Caribbean. 
(4) Since 1970, more than 80 percent of Car-
ibbean coral reefs have been lost due to 
coastal development and pollution. Soot par-
ticulates and climate change caused by burn-
ing fossil fuels have seriously damaged coral 
reefs, which are a significant source of tour-
ism dollars, fishing, biodiversity, and nat-
ural beauty. 
(5) Air pollution caused by burning oil for 
electricity— 
(A) has serious health impacts in the form 
of higher rates of asthma and other lung ail-
ments; and 
(B) can also exacerbate climate change. 
(6) The Caribbean region is particularly 
vulnerable to sea level rise and stronger 
storms 
(7) Between 2005 and 2018, the dependence 
of the countries of the Caribbean on oil was 
perpetuated 
by 
the 
Venezuelan-led 
Petrocaribe oil alliance, which— 
(A) offered preferential terms for oil sales; 
and 
(B) supplies some countries with up to 40 
percent of their energy production needs. 
(8) The ongoing domestic economic crisis 
and political turmoil in Venezuela has forced 
the Government of Venezuela to retract its 
commitments to the Petrocaribe oil alliance 
and step away as a regional power. Only 
Cuba still receives preferential Petrocaribe 
pricing on fuel exports from Venezuela, 
while other Petrocaribe member countries 
are experiencing a destabilized flow of oil. 
(9) 
China 
has 
spent 
more 
than 
$244,000,000,000 on energy projects worldwide 
since 2000, 25 percent of which was spent in 
Latin America and the Caribbean. Although 
the majority of this spending was for oil, 
gas, and coal, China has also been the largest 
investor in clean energy globally for almost 
a decade. 
(10) The World Bank estimates that the 
Caribbean will need $12,000,000,000 in power 
investments through 2035. 
(11) Renewable energy technology costs 
have decreased dramatically in recent years, 
offering a more viable economic alternative 
for energy production. Solar energy prices 
have fallen by 80 percent since 2008, causing 
significant market growth, and according to 
data released by the International Renew-
able Energy Agency, 1/3 of global power ca-
pacity is based in renewable energy. 
(12) In 2016, the International Monetary 
Fund estimated that transportation ac-
counted for 36 percent of the total primary 
energy consumed in the Caribbean subregion. 
(13) According to the United Nations Envi-
ronment Programme, Latin America and the 
Caribbean could achieve annual savings of 
$621,000,000,000 and a reduction of 1,100,000,000 
tons of CO2 by 2050 if the region’s energy and 
transport sectors reach net zero emissions. 
(14) The Caribbean has an abundance of on-
shore and offshore resources needed for re-
newable energy, including sun, wind, geo-
thermal, and some hydropower production 
capacity. 
(15) The United States Government is deep-
ly engaged in providing technical and policy 
assistance to countries of the Caribbean on 
energy issues through— 
(A) the Energy and Climate Partnership of 
the Americas; 
(B) Connecting the Americas 2022; and 
(C) bilateral assistance programs. 
(16) On February 19, 2014, at the North 
American 
Leaders’ 
Summit, 
President 
Barack Obama, Prime Minister Stephen Har-
per of Canada, and President Enrique Pen˜ a 
Nieto of Mexico reaffirmed their commit-
ment to bring affordable, reliable, and in-
creasingly renewable power to the Carib-
bean, while opening wider markets for clean 
energy and green technology. 
(17) On June 19, 2015, President Barack 
Obama announced the Caribbean Energy Se-
curity Initiative, which would partner with 
individual countries— 
(A) to transform its energy sector; 
(B) to work to increase access to finance, 
good governance, and diversification; and 
(C) to maximize the impact of existing 
donor effects. 
(18) On May 4, 2016, at the United States- 
Caribbean-Central American Energy Sum-
mit, the energy security task force formally 
launched the Caribbean Sustainable Energy 
Roadmap and Strategy (C-SERMS) as a 
mechanism to manage regional coordination 
and action on energy security and agreed to 
expand the regional market and trans-
mission system. 
(19) The United States has an important 
opportunity— 
(A) to deepen this engagement; 
(B) to work as a partner with Caribbean 
countries on a more regional and coordi-
nated basis; 
(C) to help ease the region’s dependence on 
imported oil; and

SEC. 507. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CONSERVA-
TION OF THE AMAZON RIVER BASIN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Amazon River basin and the Ama-
zon 
rainforest, 
often 
referred 
to 
as 
Amazonia— 
(A) covers more than 2,670,000 square miles 
in 
Bolivia, 
Brazil, 
Colombia, 
Ecuador, 
French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, 
and Venezuela; and 
(B) is home to more species of plants and 
animals than any other terrestrial eco-
system on the planet, housing nearly 30 per-
cent of the world’s species, which apart from 
their intrinsic value as living organisms, 
have potential value in the form of medicine, 
research, textiles, food, and other products 
for the region’s population. 
(2) Tens of millions of people depend on 
services afforded by the Amazon forest, in-
cluding— 
(A) the use of rivers for transportation; 
(B) reliance on logging and collection of 
non-timber forest products as major indus-
tries for employment; and 
(C) the cultivation of nutrients in flood-
plain areas for agriculture and areas for 
which the Amazon Basin is a watershed. 
(3) The Amazon River has long been recog-
nized as an important repository of biodiver-
sity and natural resources, not only for local 
peoples and indigenous communities, but 
also for the rest of the world due to— 
(A) its fresh water, which provides count-
less services for humans in the form of water 
agriculture, transportation, and food and 
serves as an important habitat for countless 
species, including over 2,500 species of fish 
and river dolphins; 
(B) its medicinal plants, which are contin-
ually used by local peoples to treat tradi-
tional diseases, including malaria (one of the 
most lethal diseases in the tropics), and 
which constitute 70 percent of the plant spe-
cies in the world found to have anti-cancer 
properties; 
(C) its important role as an oxygen source, 
producing 20 percent of the Earth’s oxygen 
and earning the Amazon forest the nickname 
‘‘lungs of our Earth’’ for its role in taking in 
enormous amounts of the carbon dioxide 
emitted by human activity and the burning 
of fossil fuels and replacing it with the oxy-
gen we breathe through the process of photo-
synthesis; 
(D) its food supply, which is associated 
with rainforests, including coffee, rice, choc-
olate, tomatoes, potatoes, bananas, black 
pepper, pineapples, and corn; 
(E) its role in climate control caused by its 
exchange of enormous quantities of water 
and energy with the surrounding atmos-
phere, which is estimated as being respon-
sible for creating 75 percent of its own rain-
fall, which feeds the nearby rivers through 
evapotranspiration before flowing directly 
into the ocean and influencing the currents 
that impact the climate; and 
(F) ecotourism, which produces annual 
profits of more than $11,600,000, which bene-
fits the local economy, enhances the quality 
of living through securing more jobs, and 
educates global citizens regarding the impor-
tance of maintaining the world’s natural 
spaces. 
(4) Public opinion research, conducted by 
the Brazilian polling firm Datafolha in 2020, 
found that— 
(A) 87 percent of the respondents felt 
strongly that conservation of the Amazon is 
very important; 
(B) 73 percent of the respondents are con-
cerned with the rate of increased deforest-
ation in the Amazon basin; 
(C) 77 percent of the respondents believed 
strongly that the conduct and policies of the 
ministries responsible for management and 
conservation of the Amazon have contrib-
uted to deforestation in the Amazon; 
(D) 92.5 percent of the respondents believe 
Brazil should prioritize the pursuit of eco-
nomic activities in the Amazon basin that do 
not contribute to deforestation; and 
(E) only 5.6 percent of the respondents 
think that forests need to be cut down to 
promote economic growth in the region. 
(5) The recent 8,850 square kilometer reduc-
tion of the Amazon forest, exacerbated by 
climate change, has resulted in a significant 
decrease in the ample benefits described in 
paragraph (3), in addition to the displace-
ment of many indigenous peoples due to the 
lessened economic opportunity. 
(6) Clear cutting has disrupted the habitat 
for plants and animals in the region, frac-
turing the fragile forest ecology by causing 
species to migrate and sometimes disappear. 
(7) As of September 2020, Brazil’s National 
Institute for Space Research reported that 
45,067 fires have burned in the Amazon River 
basin and more than 63,000 fires have burned 
in all of Brazil in 2020. 
(8) The removal of trees from the Amazon 
River basin has decreased water and nutrient 
uptake, while increasing runoff with greater

loads of both nitrogen and phosphorus con-
centrations, deteriorating the quality of 
fresh water, and putting the environment at 
greater risk for disasters like flooding and 
landslides. 
(9) The Government of Brazil has histori-
cally recognized the negative repercussions 
of deforestation via processes like clear cut-
ting, which had facilitated Brazil’s establish-
ment and maintenance of numerous success-
ful conservation policies and payments for 
environmental service programs, such as— 
(A) Reducing Emissions from Deforestation 
and Forest Degradation projects, such as the 
Juma project in Amazonas and the Surui 
project in Acre and subnational-scale pro-
gram in Acre and Mato Grosso, which seek 
to reduce global warming by stopping emis-
sions related to deforestation; 
(B) jurisdictional programs involving the 
collaboration of several groups, including 
farmers, government officials, businesses, 
and 
nongovernmental 
organizations, 
to 
achieve consensus on sustainability mile-
stones; 
(C) the Amazon Fund, which is primarily 
funded by the Government of Norway to im-
plement payments for forest conservation 
activities; and 
(D) the Bolsa Floresta program in the Bra-
zilian state of Amazonas, which pays land-
owners and communities to help protect for-
est areas. 
(10) United States and multilateral co-
operation efforts to protect and restore the 
Amazon have yielded significant beneficial 
impacts, such as— 
(A) the reduction of deforestation by more 
than 80 percent; and 
(B) the World Bank’s establishment of 
more than 25 percent of the areas protected 
from correspondence. 
(11) The UNESCO World Heritage site 
verifies the importance of the Amazon River 
basin being one of the richest areas in the 
planet in terms of biodiversity, ecological 
and biological processes. Deforestation and 
potential new policies could harmfully limit 
its natural resources if their benefits are not 
taken into serious consideration. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the President should— 
(A) engage with the Government of Brazil, 
through bilateral and multilateral efforts, on 
its Amazon development and deforestation 
policies, in support of the Brazilian people’s 
and the private sector’s interest in con-
serving the Amazon rainforest; 
(B) promote stewardship and conservation 
policies that support sustainable economic 
growth activities in the Amazon River basin; 
(C) consider the Government of Brazil’s 
management and land use conversion of the 
Amazon River basin policies when assessing, 
negotiating, or developing new bilateral 
agreements with Brazil, including trade 
agreements, or engaging in relevant inter-
national forums; 
(D) in the spirit of Brazil’s leadership 
hosting the 1992 Rio Summit, which led to 
the establishment of the UNFCCC, urge the 
Government of Brazil to enhance the ambi-
tion of Brazil’s efforts to mitigate green-
house gas emissions; and 
(E) encourage the Government of Brazil, 
through bilateral and multilateral efforts, to 
immediately work proactively to address cli-
mate change and to promote low carbon and 
sustainable economic development; 
(2) the United States Ambassador to Brazil 
should immediately engage with the Govern-
ment of Brazil to support improvements to 
stewardship efforts of the Amazon rainforest 
and to assist with urgent efforts to combat 
fires burning across the Amazon River basin 
by— 
(A) amplifying the Brazilian people’s con-
cerns— 
(i) about climate change and seeking op-
portunities for cooperative climate action 
through the United States-Brazil bilateral 
relationship; and 
(ii) with Brazil’s management and land use 
conversion policies affecting the Amazon 
River basin; 
(B) reinforcing United States’ support for 
the important role civil society is playing to 
keep the public informed about the impor-
tance of Amazon conservation, particularly 
as it relates to regulating carbon in the 
Earth’s atmosphere; and 
(C) offering support for efforts to combat 
fires in the Amazon River basin that are ex-
acerbating Brazil’s environmental crisis; and 
(3) the Secretary of the Treasury should 
provide financial and technical assistance to 
combat wildfires burning across the Brazil, 
including in the Amazon River basin.

nous peoples, prosecuting individuals and en-
tities that threaten or harm indigenous peo-
ples or communities, and maintain the Na-
tional Indian Foundation; 
(C) addressing activities that increase de-
forestation rates in the Amazon basin, which 
include— 
(i) curtailing indigenous people’s land 
rights; and 
(ii) unsustainable cattle ranching, soy bean 
farming, mining, hydropower dam construc-
tion, and highway construction activities;

SEC. 508. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RE-
NEWABLE ENERGY IN INDONESIA. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) cooperation on the development and de-
ployment of renewable energy technologies 
should be a priority in relations between the 
United States and Indonesia and the top pri-
ority in the countries’ energy diplomacy; 
(2) it is in the interest of United States to 
support the growth of Indonesia’s renewable 
energy sector in environmentally and so-
cially responsible ways that— 
(A) reduce reliance on fossil fuels in ways 
that do not increase pressure on the land 
sector or increase land-based emissions; 
(B) mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; 
(C) provide economic opportunities; and 
(D) improve the climate security of Indo-
nesia; 
(3) the United States, through the Bureau 
of Energy Resources of the Department of 
State, the United States International De-
velopment Finance Corporation, the Depart-
ment of Energy, the Export-Import Bank of 
the United States, the International Trade 
Administration, and the United States Agen-
cy for International Development, should en-
courage private sector investment in and fi-
nancing for the development and deployment 
of renewable power sources in Indonesia; 
(4) the United States should— 
(A) support and encourage Indonesia to 
pursue ambitious growth from solar and 
wind sources of energy generation; and 
(B) provide technical assistance to the 
Government of Indonesia and subnational 
authorities on regulatory reforms and ad-
dressing other barriers to deployment of re-
newable energy; and 
(5) it is in the interest of United States re-
frigeration and refrigerant production indus-
tries to help serve Indonesia’s increased de-
mand for refrigeration and air conditioning, 
and the adoption of the Kigali Amendment 
to the Montreal Protocol, is driving innova-
tion and investments in next-generation re-
frigeration equipment and refrigerants in In-
donesia. 
TITLE VI—WOMEN AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
ACT 
SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Women and 
Climate Change Act’’. 
SEC. 602. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Women in the United States and around 
the world are— 
(A) the linchpin of families and commu-
nities; and 
(B) often the first to feel the immediate 
and adverse effects of social, environmental, 
and economic stresses on their families and 
communities. 
(2) The United Nations has recognized, as a 
central organizing principle for its work, 
that ‘‘no enduring solution to society’s most 
threatening social, economic and political 
problems can be found without the full par-
ticipation, and the full empowerment, of the 
world’s women.’’. 
(3) The United Nations Development Pro-
gramme’s Human Development Report 2013 
predicted that the number of people living in 
extreme poverty could increase by up to

April 19, 2021 
3,000,000,000 by 2050 unless environmental dis-
asters are averted by coordinated global ac-
tion. 
(4) Climate change is already forcing the 
most vulnerable communities and popu-
lations in developing countries to face un-
precedented climate stress, including— 
(A) slow onset effects of climate change, 
such as sea level rise, increasing tempera-
tures, water scarcity, and drought; and 
(B) severe weather events and floods, which 
can lead to reduced agricultural produc-
tivity, food insecurity, and increased disease. 
(5) Climate change— 
(A) exacerbates issues of resource scarcity 
and lack of accessibility to primary natural 
resources, forest resources, and arable land 
for food production; 
(B) contributes to increased tension and in-
stability, particularly in countries and re-
gions with poor or weak governance systems; 
and 
(C) increases the workload and stresses on 
women 
farmers, 
who 
are 
estimated 
to 
produce nearly 50 percent of the food con-
sumed in most developing countries, which 
exacerbates food insecurity. 
(6) Women will disproportionately face 
harmful impacts from climate change, par-
ticularly in poor and developing countries in 
which women regularly assume increased re-
sponsibility for— 
(A) growing the family’s food; 
(B) collecting water, fuel, and other re-
sources; 
(C) earning money; and 
(D) sending remittances. 
(7) Epidemics, such as malaria and Zika, 
are expected to worsen and spread due to 
variations in climate, putting women and 
girls (especially those who are pregnant, who 
are lactating, or who hope to become preg-
nant) and children without access to preven-
tion and medical services at risk. 
(8) The direct and indirect effects of cli-
mate change have a disproportionate impact 
on marginalized women, including refugees, 
displaced persons, migrants, religious, ra-
cial, or ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, 
lesbian and trans women, women living in 
poverty, and women and girls with disabil-
ities and those infected with HIV. 
(9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact 
on the most vulnerable communities and 
populations, including women, and can be ex-
acerbated in regions of the world with chang-
ing or harsher climates, leading to migra-
tion, forced displacement, and conflicts over 
scarce natural resources, including land and 
water. 
(10) Internally displaced, refugee, and 
stateless women and girls face extreme vio-
lence and threats, including— 
(A) being forced to exchange sex for food 
and humanitarian supplies; 
(B) being at increased risk of gender-based 
violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse; 
(C) reduced access to services and care; and 
(D) increased risk for contracting HIV or 
sexually-transmitted infections, having an 
unplanned pregnancy, and experiencing poor 
reproductive health 
(11) Climate change is predicted to lead to 
increasing frequency and intensity of ex-
treme weather conditions, precipitating the 
occurrence of natural disasters around the 
globe. 
(12) The relocation and death of women as 
a result of climate change-related disasters 
often has devastating impacts on social sup-
port networks, family ties, and the coping 
capacity of families and communities. 
(13) The ability of women to adapt to cli-
mate change is constrained by underlying 
gender inequality, including a lack of— 
(A) economic freedoms; 
(B) property, land tenure, and inheritance 
rights; 
(C) access to financial resources, edu-
cation, family planning, and reproductive 
healthcare services; and 
(D) quality tools, equipment, and tech-
nology that support economic opportunity 
and independence. 
(14) Despite having unique capabilities and 
knowledge to promote, plan, and execute ac-
tivities to enhance communities’ climate 
change adaption and resilience capacities, 
women often have insufficient resources, are 
not empowered to take such actions, and are 
often excluded from leadership and decision- 
making processes. 
(15) Women have a multiplier effect be-
cause women use their income and resources, 
when given the necessary tools, to increase 
the well-being of their children and families, 
playing a critical role in reducing food inse-
curity, poverty, and socioeconomic effects of 
climate change. 
(16) Women are often underrepresented in 
the development and formulation of policy 
regarding mitigation and adaptation to cli-
mate change, even though women are often 
in the best position to provide and consult 
on adaptive strategies.

infrastructural barriers that create ob-
stacles to mobility or economic devel-
opment or expose the community to 
pollution and other health and safety 
risks, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want 
to share with my colleagues some in-
formation regarding the Reconnecting 
Communities Act, a bill that I have in-
troduced today along with my col-
leagues Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. CARDIN, 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. PADILLA, Mr. 
WARNOCK, Mr. SCHUMER and Mr. COONS. 
This legislation would address the leg-
acy of highway construction built 
through 
communities, 
especially 
through low-income communities and 
communities of color, which divided 
neighborhoods and erected barriers to 
mobility and opportunity. This legisla-
tion implements a central piece of 
President Biden’s American Jobs Plan, 
which calls for new Federal funding to 
address the need to remove infrastruc-
ture barriers in communities that have 
been historically disadvantaged and 
disconnected. 
The construction of our interstate 
highway system throughout the 20th 
Century had many positive aspects. It 
facilitated commerce and travel from 
coast to coast and connected our 
urban, suburban and rural areas. How-
ever, the construction of highways 
through established neighborhoods and 
cities also had a detrimental impact on 
the people who called those places 
home. 
Blocks of homes were torn down and 
vibrant commercial streets razed to 
make way for new highway construc-
tion, often without any input from the 
people who actually lived, worked, and 
owned businesses there. Many of these 
neighborhoods never fully recovered, 
and the highways divided cities, mak-
ing it difficult to get from one side to 
the other. This stifled economic devel-
opment and opportunity for those who 
were left behind. 
In the 1950s and 60s, the construction 
of I–95 through Wilmington, Delaware 
resulted in the demolition of homes, 
churches, and businesses, and cut off 
neighbors from each other. The ability 
to easily walk to the store or to 
church, or to have a sense of commu-
nity that living in a vibrant city 
brings, was destroyed for many people 
who lived near that path of the inter-
state. And this is not unique to Wil-
mington. From Baltimore to New Orle-
ans, cities across the country are grap-
pling with what to do with aging inter-
states blighting their neighborhoods. 
The Reconnecting Communities Act 
is designed to address this legacy of 
our 
highway 
system 
by 
funding 
projects that would remove or re-
imagine infrastructure barriers, includ-
ing elevated highway overpasses and 
highways that were built below grade. 
The bill would authorize $15 billion 
over the next five years to establish a 
new federal grant program at the De-
partment of Transportation to help 
States and local entities with planning, 
construction and local capacity build-
ing. Specifically, it would do the fol-
lowing: 
First, the bill would provide grants 
to local and Tribal governments, Met-
ropolitan Planning Organizations and 
non-profits, to help foster a greater ca-
pacity for local communities to par-
ticipate in the planning and decision- 
making process for transportation and 
economic development projects. This 
would help to ensure that new projects 
meet local needs. 
Second, it would provide grants for 
planning and feasibility studies, in-
cluding studies to look at the effect of 
a project on traffic and congestion, ac-
cessibility and equity. 
Third, it would provide grants to 
carry out construction projects that 
would either remove a highway infra-
structure barrier, or re-envision or ret-
rofit the existing structure to improve 
mobility across it. This includes cap-
ping a highway like I–95 in Wil-
mington. or transforming a highway 
into an at-grade roadway as has been 
envisioned in other States. 
As communities across the Nation 
are beginning to reimagine their down-
towns to provide more sustainable and 
equitable access, this bill will support 
local efforts to reconnect and revitalize 
areas that were harmed by the con-
struction of the Interstate Highway 
System. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
who have joined me by cosponsoring 
the Reconnecting Communities Act. In 
particular, I am appreciative of the 
leadership of the junior senator from 
Maryland, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, who helped 
to bring this issue to the attention of 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee last Congress. 
I hope that all of my colleagues will 
join us to advance this important legis-
lation, which I will be working to in-
clude in our comprehensive surface 
transportation reauthorization bill this 
year.

S. 1212. A bill to address the needs of 
workers in industries likely to be im-
pacted 
by 
rapidly 
evolving 
tech-
nologies; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 1212 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in 
Tomorrow’s Workforce Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 
percent of the Nation’s Gross Domestic Prod-
uct on labor market policies, less than half 
of what the United States spent on labor 
market policies 30 years ago. 
(2) The number of workers receiving feder-
ally supported training has declined in the 
past 3 decades as advances in technology 
have simultaneously shifted labor market 
demand over time. 
(3) Job losses from automation are more 
likely to impact women, people of color, and 
workers making less than $40,000 annually. 
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic has accelerated 
trends in automation, with 43 percent of 
businesses in the World Economic Forum’s 
Future of Jobs survey indicating they plan 
to reduce their workforce as a result of tech-
nology integration. 
(5) Strong Federal investment in expanding 
training services for workers whose jobs may 
be lost due to automation could prepare the 
United States workforce to better adapt to 
changes in the labor market and enter into 
skilled positions in technologically oriented 
occupations and industries. 
(6) A focus on preparing the workforce of 
the United States for jobs that utilize ad-
vanced technologies could grow wages, in-
crease economic productivity, and boost the 
competitiveness of the United States. 
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) AUTOMATION.—The term ‘‘automation’’ 
means a device, process, or system that func-
tions without continuous input from an op-
erator, including—

associate Justices for 152 years; 
Whereas previous attempts to increase the 
number of justices on the Supreme Court of 
the United States have been rejected and 
widely condemned by individuals of both po-
litical parties; 
Whereas, in 1937, when former President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the Ju-
dicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, a bill 
that sought to expand the number of justices 
on the Supreme Court of the United States 
from 9 justices to 15 Justices, he was harshly 
criticized by both parties and his own Vice 
President, John Nance Garner; 
Whereas, the 1937 Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee report, in response to the Court-pack-
ing plan by President Roosevelt, decried the 
plan as ‘‘a needless, futile, and utterly dan-
gerous abandonment of constitutional prin-
ciple’’, that ‘‘[i]ts ultimate operation would 
be to make this government one of men rath-
er than one of law’’ and that it was ‘‘a meas-
ure, which should be so emphatically re-
jected that its parallel will never again be 
presented to the free representatives of the 
free people of America’’; 
Whereas, during the Trump Administra-
tion, Democrats have refused to recognize 
the legitimacy of nominations made by 
President Trump to the Supreme Court of 
the United States and have advocated for 
packing the Court with additional justices 
appointed by a future Democrat president;

Committee hearing, then-Senator Joe Biden

April 19, 2021 
noted that Court packing was a ‘‘bonehead 
idea’’ and ‘‘a terrible, terrible mistake’’ that 
‘‘put in question for an entire decade the 
independence of the most significant body— 
including the Congress, in my view—the 
most significant body in this country, the 
Supreme Court of the United States of Amer-
ica’’; 
Whereas, in 2005 during a speech on the 
Senate floor, then-Senator Joe Biden praised 
members of the Democrat Party for their 
‘‘act of courage’’ in opposing the Court-pack-
ing plan of President Roosevelt, which he de-
scribed as a ‘‘power grab’’; 
Whereas, in 2019, the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg stated, ‘‘I think it was a bad 
idea when President Franklin Roosevelt 
tried to pack the Court’’, and that ‘‘if any-
thing would make the Court look partisan, it 
would be that’’; 
Whereas, in 2021, Justice Stephen Breyer 
urged supporters of court packing to ‘‘think 
long and hard’’ about undermining the inde-
pendence of the court, noting that it is im-
perative the public ‘‘trust that the court is 
guided by legal principle, not politics’’ and 
that ‘‘structural alteration motivated by the 
perception of political influence can only 
feed that latter perception, further eroding 
that trust’’; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States is based on the principle of separation 
of powers to provide for checks and balances 
on each branch of the Federal Government 
and expanding the Supreme Court of the 
United States purely for political advantage 
threatens the separation of powers and the 
system of checks and balances established in 
the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas the Federal judiciary is insulated 
from political influence through lifetime ap-
pointments and other measures to preserve 
its independence and an attempt to expand 
the Supreme Court of the United States 
purely for political purposes threatens the 
independence and integrity of the Supreme 
Court and, thus, the entirety of the judiciary 
it oversees; and 
Whereas any attempt to increase the num-
ber of justices of the Supreme Court of the 
United States or ‘‘pack the Court’’ would un-
dermine the democratic institutions and de-
stroy the credibility of the highest court in 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate opposes any at-
tempt to increase the number of justices of 
the Supreme Court of the United States or 
otherwise pack the Court.

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 1445. Mr. SCHUMER (for Ms. 
HIRONO (for herself, Ms. COLLINS, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, and Mr. WARNOCK)) pro-
posed an amendment to the bill S. 937, 
to facilitate the expedited review of 
COVID–19 hate crimes, and for other 
purposes; as follows: 
Strike all after the first word and insert 
the following: 
1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Following the spread of COVID–19 in 
2020, there has been a dramatic increase in 
hate crimes and violence against Asian- 
Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
(2) According to a recent report, there were 
nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian dis-
crimination and incidents related to COVID– 
19 between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 
2021, in all 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia. 
(3) During this time frame, race has been 
cited as the primary reason for discrimina-
tion, making up over 90 percent of incidents, 
and the United States condemns and de-
nounces any and all anti-Asian and Pacific 
Islander sentiment in any form. 
(4) Roughly 36 percent of these incidents 
took place at a business and more than 
2,000,000 Asian-American businesses have 
contributed to the diverse fabric of Amer-
ican life. 
(5) More than 1,900,000 Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander older adults, particularly 
those older adults who are recent immi-
grants or have limited English proficiency, 
may face even greater challenges in dealing 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, including dis-
crimination, economic insecurity, and lan-
guage isolation. 
(6) In the midst of this alarming surge in 
anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, a 
shooter murdered the following 8 people in 
the Atlanta, Georgia region, 7 of whom were 
women and 6 of whom were women of Asian 
descent: 
(A) Xiaojie Tan. 
(B) Daoyou Feng. 
(C) Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonza´lez. 
(D) Paul Andre Michels. 
(E) Soon Chung Park. 
(F) Hyun Jung Grant. 
(G) Suncha Kim. 
(H) Yong Ae Yue. 
(7) The people of the United States will al-
ways remember the victims of these shoot-
ings and stand in solidarity with those af-
fected by this senseless tragedy and inci-
dents of hate that have affected the Asian 
and Pacific Islander communities. 
SEC. 3. REVIEW OF HATE CRIMES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 7 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Attorney General shall designate an officer 
or employee of the Department of Justice 
whose responsibility during the applicable 
period shall be to facilitate the expedited re-
view of hate crimes (as described in section 
249 of title 18, United States Code) and re-
ports of any such crime to Federal, State, 
local, or Tribal law enforcement agencies. 
(b) APPLICABLE PERIOD DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘applicable period’’ means 
the period beginning on the date on which 
the officer or employee is designated under 
subsection (a), and ending on the date that is 
1 year after the date on which the emergency 
period described in subparagraph (B) of sec-
tion 1135(g)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1320b–5(g)(1)) ends, except that the At-
torney General may extend such period as 
appropriate. 
SEC. 4. GUIDANCE. 
(a) GUIDANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGEN-
CIES.—The Attorney General shall issue guid-
ance for State, local, and Tribal law enforce-
ment agencies, pursuant to this Act and 
other applicable law, on how to— 
(1) establish online reporting of hate 
crimes or incidents, and to have online re-
porting that is equally effective for people 
with disabilities as for people without dis-
abilities available in multiple languages as 
determined by the Attorney General; 
(2) collect data disaggregated by the pro-
tected characteristics described in section 
249 of title 18, United States Code; and 
(3) expand public education campaigns 
aimed at raising awareness of hate crimes 
and reaching victims, that are equally effec-
tive for people with disabilities as for people 
without disabilities. 
(b) GUIDANCE RELATING TO COVID–19 PAN-
DEMIC.—The Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, in co-
ordination with the COVID–19 Health Equity 
Task Force and community-based organiza-
tions, shall issue guidance aimed at raising 
awareness of hate crimes during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
SEC. 5. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2019, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) HATE
CRIME.—The term ‘‘hate crime’’ 
means an act described in section 245, 247, or 
249 of title 18, United States Code, or in sec-
tion 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 
U.S.C. 3631). 
(2) PRIORITY AGENCY.—The term ‘‘priority 
agency’’ means— 
(A) a law enforcement agency of a unit of 
local government that serves a population of 
not less than 100,000, as computed by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation; or 
(B) a law enforcement agency of a unit of 
local government that—

was ordered to lie on the table; as fol-
lows: 
After section 1, insert the following: 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following:

Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Jasmerae 
Martinez for receiving the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award. 
Jasmerae Martinez is a 12th grader at 
Mapleton Online and received this award be-
cause her determination and hard work have 
allowed her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Jasmerae 
Martinez is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Jasmerae Martinez for winning the Adams

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
CHARLES SPENCER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. Charles 
Spencer who passed away at the age of 94 
on Monday, March 22. I am grateful for the 
service of men like Mr. Spencer, and I join his 
family and loved ones in mourning his loss. 
Mr. Spencer was born on November 21, 
1926 in Clay County. He grew up on his fam-
ily’s farm and spent his entire life as a resident 
of Itawamba County. In 1944, he was married 
to his childhood sweetheart, Martha West. 
Charles was passionate about education. 
He spent his life inculcating into his students 
the value of education. He began his career 
under the Emergency Certificate in 1947 
teaching 5th and 6th grade at Tilden and Ban-
ner. He taught social studies and coached the 
men’s and women’s basketball teams at 
Cleveland Vocational School in 1951 and 
1952. In 1952 Mr. Spencer earned his BS in 
Education from Mississippi State University 
before returning to Itawamba County to serve 
as principal at Mantachie. He taught night 
classes to veterans who sought to further their 
education. In 1972 he returned to Mississippi 
State to earn his MA in Education Administra-
tion. He was then appointed as Super-
intendent of Education of Itawamba County. 
Charles is survived by his son, Keith; 
daughter, Brenda; grandchildren, Klista, Ina, 
Matthew, Beth Ann, Stephanie and Max; and 
great-grandchildren Mia Rae, Aiden, Charlie, 
Catherine, 
Colin, 
Anthony, 
Marina, 
and 
Alexios. 
Mr. Charles Spencer was a central figure in 
the education of countless Mississippi stu-
dents and I commend him for his lifetime com-
mitment to his community.

GARY STAPLES 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Gary Sta-
ples who passed away on January 2, 2021 at 
the age of 80. I send my condolences and 
prayers to Mr. Staples’ family and friends. 
Born and raised in Laurel Mississippi, he at-
tended the University of Southern Mississippi 
and Jones County Junior College. 
Representative Staples served as a member 
of the Mississippi House of Representatives 
for the 88th District. Mr. Staples was loved 
and respected by his constituents, family, 
friends and all who had the privilege of know-
ing him. 
From serving Mississippi’s 88th District for 
17 years, he has left behind a legacy of com-
mitment to the State of Mississippi for us to 
remember him by. 
Although we are sad to hear of his passing, 
we take comfort in his example of a life well 
lived and the legacy he leaves behind. On be-
half of the 4th Congressional District of Mis-
sissippi, we honor the memory of Representa-
tive Gary Staples, a loving husband, father, 
man of God, and dedicated civil servant.

HON. TROY BALDERSON 
OF OHIO

Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise

was a longtime friend of my family and we will 
miss him dearly. 
Todd passed away on Sunday, April 4,

country beginning at the age of 19 when he 
joined the U.S. Army. Upon leaving active 
duty, he joined the Alabama National Guard 
and served in the operation Desert Storm with 
the 214th MP Company.

HONORING COLONEL GREGORY 
MICHEL 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend Colonel Gregory Michel for his 
years of service to the Mississippi Emergency 
Management Agency. Col. Michel has led our 
state’s emergency agency since 2018—and 
what a fine job he has done. 
Colonel Gregory Michel retired from the mili-
tary in 2017 after nearly 30 years of service to 
the Army. He began his career with his com-
mand at Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training 
Center in Hattiesburg, MS where he served as 
Installation Commander. 
Colonel Michel is a Veteran of Operation 
Desert Shield/Desert Storm and a Combat 
Veteran of Operation Iraq Freedom. Col. 
Michel’s 
military 
decorations 
include 
the 
Bronze Star and the Combat Infantryman’s 
Badge. 
Col. Michel has remained dedicated to our 
state in his many roles, and during his time at 
MEMA was responsible for declaring more 
than nine Presidential Disaster Declarations, a 
critical piece of post-hurricane recovery efforts. 
Although retirement from MEMA might be 
different given the pandemic, I am confident 
the impact Col. Michel left on our state and at 
MEMA will be a lasting one. I want to thank 
Colonel Michel for his service to our country 
and to the state of Mississippi.

IN HONOR OF THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF FOSTER CITY 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the City of Foster City on the oc-
casion of the 50th Anniversary of its incorpora-
tion as a city on April 27, 1971. This is a 
young city with a long history, and it all began 
as a salt pond. 
Leslie Salt Company sold its land, then 
known as Brewer’s Island, to developer T. 
Jack Foster and a partner in 1958. The vision 
for the city was to develop a community that 
was more aesthetically pleasing, following an 
orderly development plan with neighborhoods 
that aged better over time. 218 surface acres 
of lagoons containing 425 million gallons of 
water were ultimately created within 4 square 
miles of land. Financing through bonds issued 
in the 1960’s, totaling $88.5 million, drove the 
creation of Foster City. Adjusted for inflation, 
this sum would be the equivalent of $738 mil-
lion in 2021 terms. 
Now 33,000 residents inhabit this glistening 
four square mile jewel adjacent to San Fran-
cisco Bay. Residents love their parks and wa-
terways. There are 24 parks and tennis courts, 
basketball fields, soccer fields, trails, picnic 
areas and an unlimited number of smiles from 
residents. Throughout America, this past year 
has been challenging because we must either 
shelter in place or stay distant from one an-
other when outside. Foster City’s architecture 
makes it simple to maintain your mental 
health. 
You can walk a quiet street, go to a trail or 
park, ride a bike on flat ground throughout the 
city, and enjoy getting dunked in the bay when 
your kite sailing skills are overcome by Mother 
Nature. It’s big news in Foster City when jelly-
fish show up in the lagoons. These marvelous 
creatures pose special challenges, but modern 
engineering and a bit of wisdom have kept 
them on the bay side of the levee system dur-
ing most years. On occasion, one can even 
spot the descendants of Brewer Island’s once 
most energetic and prolific of species: jack-
rabbits. There’s a lot for a rabbit to love about 
the city, filled as it is by such greenery that it 
would 
make 
Peter 
Rabbit 
swap 
Mr. 
McGregor’s garden for a city block in Foster 
City. 
This wonderful community loves its children. 
In normal times, youth sports are the center of 
community life for hundreds of families. 
Among the city’s many wonderful attributes is 
that its inhabitants come from the four corners 
of the earth. If you are raised in Foster City 
and join a youth soccer league, you’d better 
be prepared for parents who grew up with a 
soccer ball in every closet. Coupled with all of 
the foreign languages heard on the streets 
and what you have is a city that celebrates 
global diversity and brings people together 
through sports and cultural programs that 
highlight the kindness of the human spirit. 
Global powerhouses Gilead Sciences and 
Visa International, companies that need to re-
cruit talent globally, call Foster City home in 
part because it is so welcoming. 
Madam Speaker, I close with this other spe-
cial note about Foster City. In 2003, the city 
redeveloped its original park and renamed it 
after the late Congressman Leo J. Ryan. As 
we know, Congressman Ryan served the peo-
ple of Foster City and his district until his as-
sassination on November 18, 1978. The peo-
ple of Foster City did not have to rename a 
park in memory of a man who died a quarter 
century earlier, but they did. This tells you 
something about the character of civic leader-
ship in this community. These good people re-
alized then, and now, that public service is an 
honorable endeavor, and that those who seek 
justice and pay the heaviest price because of 
that most important of goals have died in serv-
ice to every constituent, past, present and fu-
ture. Foster City does not forget. It does not 
forget to enjoy life and it does not forget to 
honor life. 
In the decades to come, on the waterways 
and the roads, within the council chambers 
and city offices, and amongst the general pop-
ulace, this community will thrive. Even when 
jellyfish bloom in the lagoons, the optimism 
that sparked the creation of this town never 
fades. Let us all wish Foster City and its resi-
dents another 50 years of friendship and 
progress. 
IN HONOR OF THE ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS 
OF 
COMMANDER 
HOUSSAIN ‘‘SAM’’ SAREINI, ONE 
OF 
THE 
FIRST 
MUSLIM-AMER-
ICAN NAVAL COMMANDERS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Commander Houssain 
‘‘Sam’’ Sareini of Dearborn, Michigan. His ac-
complishments and service to our nation are 
worthy of commendation. 
As a young man with an interest in govern-
ment service, Commander Sareini enlisted in 
the United States Navy when he was 18 years 
old. During his first tour of duty, he was se-
lected for the Enlisted Commissioning Pro-
gram and went on to study Biochemistry at 
Iowa State University. 
Commander Sareini has served in the 
United States Navy for nearly 27 years in a 
variety of roles all over the globe. He has 
served as Air Defense Commander, Reactor 
Laboratories Division Officer, Chemistry and 
Radiological Controls Principal Assistant, Ra-
diation Health Officer, Senior Watch Officer, 
and now Commanding Officer for the USS 
Nitze. A dedicated servicemember, he has 
earned the Meritorious Service Medal, the 
Navy 
Commendation 
Medal, 
the 
Navy 
Achievement Medal, and the Good Conduct 
Medal. 
On April 9, 2021 at a ceremony in Ports-
mouth, Virginia, Commander Sareini took 
command of the USS Nitze, an Arleigh Burke- 
class guided-missile destroyer. He is one of 
the first ever Muslim-Americans to command 
his own naval ship. His Islamic faith tells him 
to ‘‘live for others’’ and military service allows 
him to do just that. A dedicated leader and an 
inspiration to all, Commander Sareini em-
bodies the unofficial Navy motto of ‘‘Not self, 
but country.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Commander Houssain ‘‘Sam’’ 
Sareini for his invaluable service to this nation. 
I join with Commander Sareini’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my grati-
tude to him for his continued exemplary serv-
ice to this country and congratulate him on 
this terrific achievement.

North Mississippi Medical Center. I join her 
family, friends, and loved ones in mourning

nier Clothing and Alan White until her retire-
ment in 2007.

She was a dedicated wife, mother, and friend. 
She was a member of Union Missionary Bap-
tist Church in Shannon where she served on 
the Missionary Society, Deacon’s Wife Auxil-
iary, Kitchen Committee, and the Usher Board. 
Left to cherish her memory are her hus-

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Jasmine 
Torres for receiving the Adams County Mayors 
and Commissioners Youth Award. 
Jasmine Torres is a 12th grader at Vantage

cause her determination and hard work have 
allowed her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Jasmine 
Torres is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Jas-
mine Torres for winning the Adams County 
Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HENRY STRAUSS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Henry Leopold Strauss of 
Denver, Colorado who passed away on April 
8, 2021. 
Henry was born in Germany in 1927. As Hit-
ler was rising to power his family fled for 
Spain, then ultimately Denmark. After immi-
grating to New York in 1937 Henry moved to 
Denver in 1939. A graduate of East High 
School and the University of Colorado, Henry 
obtained a real estate broker’s license and 
opened Strauss Realty. Henry and his first 
wife, Florence, married in 1958 and spent 
nearly four decades together before Florence 
passed away in 1995. 
Henry was a strong advocate of civic en-
gagement and was active in Democratic poli-
tics and a number of community organizations 
including the Rotary Club and the Council on 
Foreign Relations. Henry also served for 22 
years on the Metropolitan State University 
Foundation Board. An avid traveler, Henry 
was crossing the globe well into his 80s with 
his second wife, Joan. Henry had a particular 
appreciation for China and made a impressive 
total of 26 trips there over the years. 
In 1995, Henry set up the Florence G. 
Strauss Indigenous Medicine Collection Fund 
to collect books related to complementary 
health practices and indigenous therapies 
around the world. This collection became 
Henry’s greatest pride and joy over the past 
25 years and currently contains over 4,000 
columns. 
Henry was a devoted husband and loving 
father and grandfather. He is survived by his 
wife Joan, his son Andy, and daughters Pam 
and Mimi, and his grandchildren Abbie, Emily, 
Emma, and Edie. I am deeply grateful for his 
lifetime of service to our community.

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the career of Jerry

man of color to serve in Tishomingo County 
law enforcement. l am grateful for Mr. Boyd’s 
service to the state of Mississippi and join his 
family and loved ones in celebrating his life-
time of service. 
Mr. Boyd, a native of Hernando, attended 
the University of Mississippi and graduated 
with a degree in public administration in 1977. 
In 1980, Jerry attended the Mississippi High-
way Patrol School. For 23 years he served 
Tishomingo County and eventually retired from 
the MHP. 
Jerry Boyd joined the Corinth Police Depart-
ment where he currently serves as a Lieuten-
ant. After 14 years of dedicated service, Lieu-
tenant Boyd will be retiring from CPD. He will 
also be retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel after 
28 years of service in the Mississippi National 
Guard. 
I am thankful for great men like Jerry Boyd 
who dutifully protect our great state, and I 
cherish the opportunity to celebrate his many 
accomplishments.

HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding military service of 
Colonel Bobby Ginn. Colonel Ginn, his wife

Tylertown, Mississippi. Bobby comes from a 
long line of family members rich in military tra-
dition. His grandfather served in WWI and his 
father served in WWII, both mobilizing through 
Camp Shelby MS, the very same military post 
that Colonel Ginn commanded from July 2017 
through November 2020.

HONORING 
BERTINE 
BAHIGE 
ON 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
2021 
WYO-
MING NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED 
PRINCIPAL 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Bertine Bahige on 
being named the 2021 Wyoming National Dis-
tinguished Principal. 
Bertine was born and raised in the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo until he was kid-
napped by the Mai Mai Rebel Group who 
came to his town in eastern DRC looking to 
abduct new recruits. He escaped after two 
years and spent five years in a refugee camp 
before being resettled in the United States. 
After he arrived in the United States, he jug-
gled three jobs to put himself through commu-
nity college and never missed a class. Bertine 
did so well in school that he was offered a 
scholarship to study at the University of Wyo-
ming, and after graduating, decided to make 
Wyoming his home and begun looking for 
ways to give back to his community. 
He started his career as a high school 
teacher in Gillette and is now the Principal at 
Rawhide Elementary school. Bertine has had 
such an impact on his students that many of 
them come back years later to ask him for ad-
vice or guidance in their lives. This out-
standing accomplishment is a true reflection of 
Bertine’s hard work, dedication, and commit-
ment to his students. Rawhide Elementary 
school is lucky to have someone who puts 
students first and values the positive impact 
teachers have on the students they teach. 
I thank Bertine for his dedication to Wyo-
ming students and his contributions to edu-
cation. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
JOSEPH MCCOY 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
memory of Joseph McCoy. 
On the morning of April 23, 1897, an African 
American named Joseph McCoy, just a teen-
ager, was lynched in Alexandria, Virginia. On 
April 22, Joseph McCoy was arrested without 
a warrant. That evening and into the early 
morning of April 23 a white mob made two at-
tempts to break into the police station where 
he was being held. In the second attempt the 
mob forcibly took him from his jail cell, shot 
him, bludgeoned him, and hanged him from 
the lamppost on the southeast corner of Cam-
eron and Lee Streets. McCoy was buried in a 
pauper’s grave at Penny Hill Cemetery. Jo-
seph McCoy was the first documented lynch-
ing victim in Alexandria. 
The lynching of Joseph McCoy is only one 
of 86 documented lynchings committed in Vir-
ginia between 1880 and 1930. These acts of 
premeditated violence were deliberate at-
tempts by whites to terrorize and control black 
populations across the state. 
On April 23, the City of Alexandria’s Equal 
Justice Initiative Community Remembrance 
Project will hold a remembrance event for Jo-
seph McCoy. It will feature the unveiling of a 
small in-person marker and a wider com-
memoration via an In Memoriam web page. 
It is incumbent on all of us, particularly 
those born into privilege, to remember this 
shameful episode of our history and others 
like it. In doing so, we are better able to see 
the continuous chain of racially motivated vio-
lence against black Americans that spans our 
Nation’s history. We can truly honor the mem-

LUTTMAN 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Colonel Phyllis 
Luttman who passed away on March 1, 2021. 
I send my condolences and prayers to her 
husband, Walter, as well as her family and 
friends. 
Col. Luttman joined the Air Force in 1962 
and was commissioned as a 1st Lieutenant in 
October 1969 after receiving her basic nursing

ous installations as an Operating Room and 
Central Supply Director including Otis AFB, 
Massachusetts, Bunker Hill AFB, Indiana, 
Tuslog Det 37 in Ankara Turkey, Sheppard 
AFB in Texas, David Grant Medical Center in 
California, and the Medical Center at Keesler 
AFB. 
Col. Luttman was very active in numerous 
professional organizations including the Aero-
space Medical Association. She was elected 
President of the Flight Nurse Section from 
1979 through 1980 and during her career re-
ceived the Brig. Gen. E.A. Hoefly Award for 
clinical and managerial excellence. 
Col. Luttman was awarded numerous deco-
rations for her service, including the Legion of 
Merit, Air Force Meritorious Service with two 
oak leaf clusters, the Joint Services Com-
mendation Medal, and the Air Force Com-
mendation Medal. I admire Colonel Luttman 
for her unwavering dedication to our country. 
Although we are saddened by her passing, 
we take comfort in her example of a life well 
lived and the legacy she leaves behind. On 
behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Mis-
sissippi, we honor the memory of Colonel 
Phyllis Luttman, a loving wife, a dedicated civil

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
GERALD THOMAS KIDD 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. Gerald 
Kidd who passed away on February 20 at 
North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo. I 
join his family and loved ones in mourning his 
loss. 
Mr. Kidd grew up in Pontotoc County, grad-
uating from Hurricane High School. In 1944 he 
married Mildred Dowdy. In that same year he 
entered service as a private in the United 
States Army and was assigned to the Euro-
pean Theatre during WWII. He was a rifleman 
in the 2nd platoon of Company B 318th Infan-
try. Shortly before Christmas of 1944, he was 
taken prisioner by German soldiers. He was 
released in April of 1945 and was awarded the 
purple heart. 
Gerald returned to Pontotoc and his wife, 
Mildred where they had two children. He soon 
began a career in home building that started 
in Memphis but quickly moved he and his fam-
ily around the country. The pair retired to the 
Alabama Gulf Coast before finally returning to 
Pontotoc. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife of 
77 years, Mildred; children Sandy and Gary; 
two grandchildren and several great-grand-
children. 
I am grateful for the service of men like Mr. 
Kidd who dedicated their life to family, faith, 
and country.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the First District of Oklahoma’s April Veteran 
of the Month, Willie Braggs. 
Willie Braggs is a retired Air Force officer

As the father of two Jenks graduates, he is a

and were married in the Fall of 2020. 
Scot was known by his squadron for his 
love of flying. When he was young, he spoke 
of one day becoming a pilot in the United 
States Air Force. He was dedicated to his stu-
dents as an instructor pilot and he impacted 
countless lives throughout his career. 
Left to cherish Scot’s memory are his wife, 
Audra Dial Ames; parents Ginger Bailey and 
Scot Wayne Ames; sister, Courtni; nieces Fe-

HONORING JOSEPH CHERUP, JR. 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a constituent of mine and a true 
American hero from Fenton, Michigan—Mr. 
Joseph Cherup, Jr. 
Throughout the course of his life, Mr. 
Cherup has worn many hats in the service of 
his nation, his community, and his family. 
While serving his country in Korea, he proudly 
wore the cap of an Army captain. As an officer 
at the Koje Do POW prison, Mr. Cherup was 
instrumental in negotiating the successful re-
lease of General Francis Dodd when he was 
held hostage for three days. 
When Mr. Cherup returned home, he wore 
the hat of an engineer. He has owned several 
businesses and was a founding member of 
the Leelanau Conservancy, Traverse City 
Condominiums, Custom Electric, Revolution 
DC, Kolene Corporation, and Trade Winds Bar 
in Detroit. 
But beyond his honorable service and his 
achievements in business, at his core, Mr. 
Cherup is simply a kind man who has helped 
take care of others. 
When he was 21 years old, his father, Jo-
seph Sr. passed away, leaving him to care for 
his mother, Rose, and his younger sister, 
Delores. In 1984, his mother moved in with 
him in Fenton so he could take better care of 
her, which he did until she passed away in 
2007. 
His entire life, Mr. Cherup has generously 
donated his time and his money to charities 
and causes that help others. He has worn

IN MEMORY OF STEVE FOX 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the tragic passing of 
Steve Fox, a pioneering advocate, strategist, a 
true leader in the cannabis legalization effort. 
It is fitting today that we are passing the 
SAFE Banking Act. We wouldn’t be where we 
are today without Steve and his amazing ef-
forts. His life work, leadership, and strategic 
brilliance are unmatched. 
Passing this critical legislation today would 
be a small part of a fitting memorial for a man 
whose efforts made it possible, indeed, imper-
ative to solve this problem. 
I first met Steve as we were strategizing on 
the Oregon legalization effort. Back in 2013, 
after the Colorado legalization campaign that 
he orchestrated had passed and before Or-
egon joined the ranks of legalization, he was 
already a legend. He pioneered so much of 
the groundwork for the legalization movement 
that exploded after the success of the Colo-
rado campaign which owed so much to his 
strategic brilliance. 
Steve was thoughtful, hardworking, and self- 
effacing. While this has become a national 
movement with many leaders now emerging, 
none compare with Steve. Few will fully under-
stand his many contributions and importance. 
I for one will miss his genuine, quiet leader-
ship. 
As someone who’s been working on this 
longer than anyone in American politics, I 
know we are all deeply, deeply indebted to 
Steve. We mourn his loss, extend our 
thoughts to his family and many friends. 
This should be the year that we finish the 
pioneering work of his career. It would be a fit-
ting capstone to a lifetime of cannabis leader-
ship, activism, and progress.

ment that can be attained with hard work and

HON. TRENT KELLY

Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Reverend 
Joseph McKnight who passed away February 
27, 2021. I join his family, friends, and loved 
ones in mourning his loss. 
Born 
to 
Reverend 
Richard 
Franklin 
McKnight and Flora Hicks on January 4, 1956, 
Rev. McKnight was raised with the conviction 
of service to God. He grew up near Nashville, 
Tennessee and graduated high school before 
continuing his education in Theology and Psy-
chology. At the age of 16 he recognized his 
call to ministry. In September of 1988 he was 
ordained as a Licensed Minister with the As-
semblies of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Rev. McKnight married Roxan Prater on 
June 10, 1977. Throughout his ministry he has 
served as Pastor at Milledgeville Pentecostal 
Church, Youth President of the Tennessee 
District ALJC, and Youth Pastor for the Pente-
costal Church of Blue Mountain. He has also 
served on the board of Iron Hill Christian 
Academy, Chairman of the Board of Blue 
Mountain Children’s Home, and New Begin-
nings International Children’s & Family Serv-
ices Board. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife, 
Roxann; brothers Robert, Richard, Ron, and 
Steve; sister, Glenda; and many nieces and 
nephews. 
Rev. McKnight had an immeasurable impact 
on the faith community across Mississippi and 
I am grateful to his service to God, family, and 
state.

HONORING HANK ROGERS 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO

Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Hank Rog-
ers who passed away on January 4, 2021. My 
deepest condolences and most sincere pray-
ers are with his wife of 49 years, Nancy, as 
well as his family and friends. 
Mr. Rogers grew up in D’Iberville, and 
proudly lived and raised his family in South 
Mississippi. He is a 1970 graduate of 
D’Iberville High School and obtained his asso-
ciates degree in Drafting from MGCCC. 
Hank was a principled man devoted to his 
faith, his country, and his family. Many de-
scribe him as a funny, quick witted, intelligent, 
strong willed, ‘‘Southern Gentleman’’ who was 
committed to his beliefs, maintained a strong 
work ethic and served as a mentor to many in 
the community. 
Hank was a volunteer leader having served 
as the President of the D’Iberville Historical 
Society, for two years, ‘‘heading up’’ many 
projects geared toward revitalizing his home-
town. He was a member of the Mississippi 
Civil Air Patrol, serving as Wing Commander 
from 2016 until his death, advancing up to the 
rank of Colonel. We honor Mr. Rogers for the 
service he showed to his country and to his 
community. 
Although we are sad to hear of his passing, 
we take comfort in his example of a life well 
lived and the legacy he leaves behind. On be-
half of the 4th Congressional District of Mis-
sissippi, we honor the memory of Mr. Hank 
Rogers, a loving husband, a dedicated civil 
servant and a man of God.

IN HONOR OF THE HANNAFORD 
SUPERMARKETS 
ACHIEVING 
ZERO WASTE IN THE YEAR 2020 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to acknowledge Hannaford Supermarkets in 
producing zero pounds of food waste in 2020. 
Hannaford Supermarkets has 183 stores lo-
cated across New England and New York, 
making it the first large-scale supermarket to 
achieve 
this 
landmark 
in 
sustainability. 
Throughout 2020, Hannaford Supermarkets 
successfully diverted 65 million pounds of food 
waste out of landfills. 
Instrumental in Hannaford’ s success in this 
endeavor is that each of its 183 stores has a 
team of hardworking individuals dedicated to 
rigidly following the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency Food Recovery Hierarchy. 
After reducing surplus at the source of produc-
tion, the Food Recovery Hierarchy advises 
that to create a more sustainable food system, 
we donate surplus product to food insecure in-
dividuals, followed by donations to local farm-
ers for animal feed. 
Food recovery and donation have long been 
staples of Hannaford operations. However, 
when donations are not feasible, Hannaford 
Supermarkets partners with Agri-Cycle to en-
gage in the hierarchy’s fourth tier, industrial 
repurposing. Based in Scarborough, Maine, 
Agri-Cycle is a food waste recycling company 
that turns food into energy. Through this part-
nership, Hannaford has been able to fully real-
ize their zero-food waste goal. 
Achieving zero waste is an accomplishment 
on its own, but I would like to highlight the 
added difficulty to this task caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic. As the coronavirus 
waged on with no clear end in sight, our agri-
culture and food system industries were dis-
rupted to an unprecedented degree. While 
shoppers began to decrease their number of 
supermarket visits to limit their exposure to the 
disease, they simultaneously began spending 
more per trip. Hannaford Supermarkets were 
able to not only weather this supply and de-
mand shock, but also to divert all unsold food 
away from landfills. 
New Hampshire’s way of life is rooted in our 
natural surroundings and keeping our landfills 
as empty as possible is imperative to pre-
serving the environment and our natural re-
sources. Hannaford’s pioneering curiosity has 
led to a landmark achievement in supermarket 
sustainability. Hannaford Supermarkets’ con-
tinuing dedication to sustainability and service 
are immeasurable.

THE PARRISH FAMILY 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of the 
Parrish Brothers of Burkesville, Kentucky. 
Barney, Watson, and Taylor Parrish each 
honorably served their country during World 
War II, with Barney paying the ultimate sac-
rifice. The Parrish Brothers’ service to our 
country did not end after World War II as Wat-
son and Taylor continued defending America 
during the Korean War. During the war, Wat-
son was seriously wounded and returned to 
duty less than a week later, where he also 
paid the ultimate sacrifice. After the Korean 
War, Taylor returned to Kentucky and contin-
ued serving others and raising a family in the 
First District of Kentucky. The family’s sacrifice 
was awarded two purple hearts and a bronze 
star. 
The legacy of the Parrish family leads us all 
to reflect on the freedoms we hold dear and 
the sacrifices American heroes make to pro-
tect them. The service and sacrifices they 
bravely gave should not and will not be forgot-
ten. I join their family in friends to celebrate 
their legacy and honor their noble service to 
our country.

Colonel Robert Allan Smith passed away. 
Allan served his Nation for over 45 years in 
the United States Air Force (USAF) and in the

Upon his Military commissioning, he com-
pleted USAF Pilot Training, Fort Rucker, AL, 
and a decade later served there as a Flight 
Examiner, Instructor Pilot, and Academic In-
structor. As a Commander for multiple Squad-
rons and missions worldwide, his leadership 
and focus on his unit personnel achieved out-
standing results in rescue and medical evacu-
ation missions. He was assigned to the Pen-
tagon, USAF Headquarters, and upon retire-
ment began an exemplary career as a federal 
civilian employee in the DoD, USAF Head-
quarters. 
Mr. Smith is greatly missed by many Military 
colleagues for his dedication and significant 
contributions and by his Pentagon Chapel 
friends. Allan is survived by his devoted broth-
er, David Smith (Jeanne); daughters, Ms. 
Jenny Pechou, Ms. Ashley Smith and Mrs. 
Sarah Tinsley (Daniel); and cousins, Maxwell

ther-in-law, Retired CMSgt James Moseley. 
I join countless friends, family members, 
and colleagues in mourning the loss of Lieu-
tenant Colonel Robert Smith. He was an out-
standing man dedicated to family, faith, and 
country, and he will be deeply missed.

Lubritz who passed away on February 13, 
2021 at the age of 87. I send my condolences 
and prayers to Ronald’s wife, Carol, as well as

HONORING 
CYNTHIA 
PEARSON 
AND 
HER 
OUTSTANDING 
CON-
TRIBUTIONS TO THE HEALTH OF 
WOMEN AND GIRLS 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is an 
honor and pleasure to extend my congratula-
tions to Cynthia Pearson, a leader of the wom-
en’s health movement for many decades, on 
her exceptional service to the women of the 
United States and on her well-earned retire-
ment. 
Cynthia has served as Executive Director of 
the 
National 
Women’s 
Health 
Network 
(NWHN) for more than 24 years, and prior to 
that led the organization’s program and policy 
work. In that time she established an exem-
plary record as an effective and influential ad-
vocate, leading campaigns to protect women 
from risky drugs and devices; require the gov-
ernment to research conditions that affect 
women; ensure that women have access to 
full information about medical products and 
clinical trials; expand women’s access to com-
prehensive reproductive health care services; 
and protect women against coercion and 
abuse in health care. I would like to highlight 
just a few of the accomplishments of her lead-
ership at the NWHN and the contributions it 
made to advancing research for women’s 
health and increasing access to health care. 
In 1987, Cynthia and the National Women’s 
Health Network led a grassroots campaign 
that convinced the National Cancer Institute to 
fund the first breast cancer prevention trial that 
examined the effects of a low-fat diet on 
breast cancer. And Cynthia helped the NWHN 
to produce the first-ever fact sheets on breast 
cancer and African American, Latina, Native 
American and Asian American women, high-
lighting the disparities in survival experienced 
by women of color and building momentum for 
targeted outreach programs. Her work on 
breast cancer also included advocacy that 
prompted the U.S. Congress to investigate the 
lack of informed consent in trials of a breast 
cancer treatment drug that was being given to 
healthy women. As a result of that investiga-
tion, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) re-
vised their informed consent rules for govern-
ment-funded clinical trials, ensuring that future 
volunteers would be given complete informa-
tion about serious and potentially fatal risks 
associated with study drugs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E421 
April 19, 2021 
With Cynthia’s leadership, the NWHN be-
came one of the first and most prescient crit-
ics of the unproven, yet widespread, use of 
menopause hormone therapy to prevent heart 
disease in women. In 1990, Cynthia testified 
at the Food and Drug Administration, per-
suading the agency not to approve preventive 
use of the drugs without first requiring the 
sponsors to provide the same standard of evi-
dence from placebo controlled trials that it had 
required for all drugs approved for heart dis-
ease prevention in men. A year later, she 
spearheaded the NWHN’s successful advo-
cacy to persuade the NIH to fund and launch 
the largest ever study of the health of older 
women, the Women’s Health Initiative, which 
enrolled more than 27,000 women in clinical 
trials of menopause hormone therapy. 
In 2002, Cynthia’s skepticism about meno-
pause hormone therapy was proven well- 
founded when the Women’s Health Initiative 
showed that hormone therapy does not pre-
vent heart disease and, in fact, increases the 
risk of stroke and in some cases, breast can-
cer. Cynthia and the NWHN educated women 
about the results of those trials, so that they 
could make more informed decisions about 
whether to use menopause hormone therapy. 
This led to the largest-ever drop in breast can-
cer rates. In one decade, more than 160,000 
women did not get breast cancer because the 
NWHN helped them avoid exposure to the 
drugs that would have caused it. In 2012, 
Cynthia received the Grassroots Activism 
Award from the National Breast Cancer Coali-
tion in recognition of this lifesaving work. 
Cynthia also successfully advocated for the 
NIH to fund the only multi-ethnic long-term 
study of the menopause transition in healthy 
women. The study enrolled more than 3,000 
women and has resulted in nearly 500 publi-
cations, providing essential information that 
enables women to understand what is normal 
in menopause, and how that’s different across 
race and ethnicity. 
Starting in 2007, as a co-founder of Raising 
Women’s Voices for the Health Care We 
Need, a national collaborative initiative that 
supports quality affordable health care for all, 
Cynthia helped build the grassroots support 
that was integral to the successful enactment 
of the Affordable Care Act, which extended 
health insurance coverage to tens of thou-
sands of women. The coverage made possible 
by the Affordable Care Act has provided 
women with access to lifesaving health care, 
including no co-pay coverage for preventive 
care such as cervical cancer screening and 
contraceptive care. In recent years, Cynthia 
worked within the Raising Women’s Voices 
collaborative to help defeat multiple attempts 
to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and has 
been instrumental in bringing the voices of 
women, people of color, and LGBTQ people to 
the national health care debate. 
In the reproductive health arena, working in 
partnership with the SisterSong Women of 
Color Reproductive Justice Collective, Cynthia 
and the NWHN created a statement of prin-
ciples to guide the provision of long-acting re-
versible contraceptives. The statement was 
signed by over a hundred organizations and 
has helped keep patient autonomy front and 
center, protecting patients from coercive prac-
tices while expanding access to contraception. 
Finally, in addition to being an effective edu-
cator of consumers and a persuasive advo-
cate in her attempts to influence government 
policy, Cynthia has been an essential ally and 
partner to policymakers working within the fed-
eral government. In 2018, she helped organize 
a lightning-speed advocacy campaign that in 
just one week saved the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration Office of Women’s Health from an 
attempt to defund it and prevent its staff from 
doing the work the office was established to 
do. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending 
our sincerest appreciation to Cynthia Pearson 
for her vital contributions to the health of 
women and girls.

RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN 
GOLD STAR MOTHERS, INC. 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I would like to take a moment to recognize a 
recent event that generously contributed to 
and positively impacted the welfare of our 
community and citizenry here in the 27th Con-
gressional District of New York. I gladly wel-
comed the Department of New York of the 
American Gold Star Mothers, Inc. to my home-
town of Buffalo, New York for their 84th Con-
vention on April 9–10, 2021. 
I recognize the American Gold Star Moth-
ers, women that share the tragedy of having 
children that died in connection to military 
service or are missing in action. These Gold 
Star Mothers strive to keep the memory of 
their sons and daughters alive by working to 
help veterans, those currently serving in the 
military, their families, and their communities. 
I am grateful for their efforts to come together 
to respect and honor our fallen service mem-
bers, especially considering the immense 
hardship they have experienced themselves. 
There are many instances in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD of service flags being adopt-
ed-that precede the creation of the American 
Gold Star Mothers organization—and I would 
like to highlight two in particular. In 1917 Ohio 
veteran and businessman Robert L. Queisser 
created the Blue Star Service Flag to honor 
his two sons serving in the First World War 
and other service members of the U.S. mili-
tary. The CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of Sep-
tember 24, 1917 reflects the adoption of this 
service flag. This flag recognizes those who 
give so much for liberty and acknowledges 
that the dearest thing to a father and mother 
are their children. 
Later, in 1918, President Woodrow Wilson 
approved a suggestion by the Women’s Com-
mittee of the Council of National Defense that 
mothers who lost a child in World War I wear 
a gold star on a traditional black mourning 
armband. This led to creation of the Gold Star 
Service Flag, where a gold star was placed in-
side the flag’s blue star, signifying a service 
member has died. 
The Gold Star Service flag adoption was, of 
course, followed by the creation of the Amer-
ican Gold Star Mothers, Inc, an organization 
that offered its 65 original charter members 
the opportunity to find strength in fellowship. In 
1928, twenty five mothers of American service 
members lost in World War I met in Wash-
ington, D.C. under the leadership of Grace 
Darling Seibold, the mother of U.S. Army First 
Lieutenant George V. Seibold killed in action, 
to establish the American Gold Star Mothers, 
Inc. The organization was officially incor-
porated on January 5, 1929. 
That same year, Congress provided funding 
for these mothers and widows to travel to 
cemeteries in Europe to visit their loved ones. 
In 1930, a group of 231 Gold Star women 
sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey aboard the 
passenger liner SS America on the inaugural 
pilgrimage to the European graves of their 
sons and husbands who died in World War I. 
When this program ended three years later, 
nearly 6,700 Gold Star women had journeyed 
across the Atlantic to bid a final farewell to 
loved ones laid to rest in war cemeteries in 
France, Belgium, and Great Britain. 
Congress later granted a federal charter to 
the American Gold Star Mothers, Inc. and des-
ignated the last Sunday in September as 
‘‘Gold Star Mother’s Day.’’ Congress also au-
thorized and requested President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt issue a proclamation in observance 
of this occasion. Each year on this day, we 
express the love, sorrow, and reverence of the 
people of the United States for American Gold 
Star Mothers. 
We especially recognize our American Gold 
Star Mothers and their fallen soldiers in New 
York’s 27th District. At the Buffalo & Erie 
County Naval & Military Park resides the U.S. 
Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans (DD–537). 
This National Historic Landmark has been a 
public memorial and museum ship since 1979, 
and is sponsored by Alleta Sullivan, a Gold 
Star Mother whose five sons were killed in ac-
tion. George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and 
Albert Sullivan-brothers from Waterloo, IA— 
died when their cruiser was sunk at the First 
Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. 
I am glad the Gold Star Mothers recently 
had the opportunity to gather in Buffalo, New 
York for the 2021 Convention of the Depart-
ment of New York of the American Gold Star 
Mothers. I remain incredibly grateful for and 
humbled by the Gold Star Mothers’ commit-
ment to honoring and reflecting on the leg-
acies of their sons and daughters lost in serv-
ice to our Nation; finding strength in the fellow-
ship of each other; and helping veterans, cur-
rent military servicemembers and their fami-
lies, and our communities.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF TODD

HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Todd Gale. 
Mr. Gale was an outstanding Mississippian 
and I join his loved ones in mourning his loss. 
Todd was born In Columbus, Mississippi on 
October 9, 1968. He was educated at Heritage 
Academy before matriculating to Mississippi 
State University where he studied Landscape 
Architecture. After graduating, he joined the 
United States Forest Service in Ketchikan, 
Alaska. 
Todd Gale married Stephanie McLain on 
July 16, 1994. With her support, Todd earned 
his Masters Degree in Economic Development 
from the University of Southern Mississippi. 
He soon became the General Manager of Co-
lumbus Light and Water. He served on the 
boards of the Tennessee Valley Public Power 
Association and American Public Power Asso-
ciation. Todd was a community servant and 
was active on the boards of Main Street Co-
lumbus, Columbus Lowndes Humane Society, 
Mississippi University for Women Advisory 
Board and St. Paul’s Episcopal Church Vestry 
and Junior Warden. 
Left to cherish Todd’s memory are his wife, 
Stephanie; children, Stormy and Gunnar; and 
his godchildren. Todd was a beloved member 
of the Columbus community and a man dedi-
cated to his family and faith. He will be deeply 
missed.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
WALTER GANN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 19, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Corporal Walter Gann, an American hero and 
an outstanding representation of the state of 
Mississippi. 
Walter Gann was born on January 31, 1922 
to John and Mary Rogers Gann. He spent the 
first eighteen years of his life in Calhoun City, 
Mississippi. Only July 3, 1941 he joined the 
United States Army Air Forces in Jackson, 
Mississippi and was soon deployed to the 
Philippines. At eighteen years old Walter faced 
attack by the Japanese Imperial Army. After 
several months of battle with minimal food, 
supplies, and medical care, the American sol-
diers were forced to surrender; the Bataan 
Death March began on April 9, 1942. Corporal 
Gann, enduring shrapnel wounds and mal-
nutrition, marched 65 miles in the blistering 
heat. 
It is believed Corporal Gann arrived at Fu-
kuoka POW Camp No. 1 on Kyushu Island 
where he faced barbaric treatment from Japa-
nese guards. He was eventually transported to 
Japan; Gann and his fellow soldiers stood 
shoulder to shoulder on the Japanese hell 
ship. Men died by the dozens of suffocation, 
starvation, and dysentery. In Japan, Corporal 
Gann was a POW for three and a half years. 
Corporal Gann was released upon American 
Victory and was immediately treated in a 
Washington hospital before returning home. 
His family rejoiced to see him alive and safe. 
He was called to testify in the war crime trials 
following WWII but could not attend because 
he was hospitalized. For the remainder of his 
life Corporal Gann bore the weight of all he 
had witnessed. 
In 1949 Walter moved to Booneville, Mis-
sissippi and married Juanita Goddard. To-
gether they raised four children. In August of 
1963 his wife passed, and in November of that 
year his son was killed in a motorcycle acci-
dent. In 1970 he moved to Chattanooga, Ten-
nessee until his death on October 14, 1980. 
He was laid to rest at Crossroads cemetery in 
Jumpertown, Mississippi with his wife and son. 
In the course of his life Corporal Gann was 
awarded the Good Conduct Medal, a Purple 
Heart, the WWII Victory Medal, an A.P. The-
ater Medal with 1 Bronze Star, the American 
Defense Medal with 1 Bronze Star, and the 
Philippine Liberation Medal with 1 Bronze 
Star. He also received a letter from President 
Harry S. Truman thanking him for his service 
to the United States. 
I am grateful for the service of Corporal 
Walter Gann and admire his commitment to 
faith, family, and country.
