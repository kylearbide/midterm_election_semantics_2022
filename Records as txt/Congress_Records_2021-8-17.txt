PRAYER 
Pastor 
Zack 
Randles, 
Waterfront 
Church, Washington, D.C., offered the 
following prayer: 
Lord, Your Word tells us that You 
give strength to the weary, and You in-
crease the power of the weak. You are 
our place to go when we are empty and 
our second wind when we are worn 
down. 
How do You restore the weary war-
rior? If we wait on You, You will refill 
us. If we look to You, You will guide 
us. If we listen to You, You will lead 
us. You make broken wings soar and 
weak legs sprint. King David often 
calls You a fortress. You are a place of 
rest and peace no matter what comes 
to our gates. 
Strengthen us today, God, as we ac-
knowledge You. And be our fortress of 
peace when we run to You. I proclaim 
these things in the mighty name of 
Jesus. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E903 
August 17, 2021 
IN HONOR OF RAYNA LEHMAN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 17, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Rayna Lehman as she retires 
from her position of community service with 
the San Mateo County Central Labor Council. 
Rayna’s remarkable 39-year career at the 
council, and her years of work in labor before 
joining the central labor council, were labors of 
love. 
It is impossible to fully describe the scope of 
Rayna Lehman’s work in our community since 
she first joined us in 1970, a young woman 
with a cat, a guitar and a big smile. In the past 
51 years, she became a union painter, led the 
union, served on the labor council, and filled 
numerous civic positions including on the San 
Mateo County Childcare Partnership Council, 
the First Five Community Steering Committee, 
a countywide Blue Ribbon Task Force on 
Healthcare to expand healthcare access, a 
taskforce to ensure the equitable rollout of the 
Affordable Care Act, the county planning com-
mission, 
the 
state 
Workforce 
Investment 
Board, the countywide school to career part-
nership committee, and dozens of other posi-
tions of leadership leading to improvements in 
the health, earning power and dignity of San 
Mateo County residents. 
From 1982 to the present, Rayna Lehman 
served the labor council as the first Commu-
nity Services Director and Labor Liaison to the 
United Way Bay Area. It’s been a wild ride. 
The community services director is an all- 
encompassing title. Her efforts to fight hunger 
and deter evictions during recessions were 
lifelines for thousands. During one recession 
in the 2000’s, Rayna created a program to re-
tool union members to work in the emerging 
biotechnology sector. Time and again, Rayna 
distributed thousands of bags of groceries to 
unemployed workers. During the 2020 pan-
demic, the total reached 22,600 families. If 
you estimate four persons per family, that’s 12 
percent of the county’s population. 
Rayna Lehman is about success for all. She 
knew that in San Mateo County, both parents 
need to work. She helped found Palcare, a 
nonprofit center offering care for children from 
three months to five years of age 24 hours a 
day. Palcare focuses on meeting the special 
needs of workers whose schedules require 
very early and nighttime work. It’s an extraor-
dinary success, affordable by design, and it al-
lows workers to know that their children are 
safe and offered a quality preschool education 
while their parents are at work. Rayna served 
on the board and in other leadership positions 
at Palcare for many years. 
Equal opportunity is the promise of America 
and a requirement if we are to sustain our de-
mocracy. Good jobs in labor begin with ap-
prenticeships. In fact, Rayna was the first fe-
male apprentice in Painters District Council 
33. In her job with the labor council, she no-
ticed that San Mateo County’s union halls 
were not recruiting enough women or young 
people from marginalized communities. Rayna 
began a pre-apprenticeship program that al-
lowed students to improve their math and so-
cial skills, and to learn about safety on the job, 
among many subjects. The program is a wild 
success, always full, and a pathway to the 
middle class for hundreds. 
In 1982, while I served on the San Mateo 
County Board of Supervisors, it was my honor 
to serve with Rayna on the first San Mateo 
County Advisory Council on Women, later to 
become the Commission on the Status of 
Women. The purpose of the council/commis-
sion is simple yet profound: To improve the 
lives of women in San Mateo County. Rayna 
served from 1982 to 1986 and during that time 
we held Feminization of Poverty hearings and 
made many recommendations ultimately lead-
ing to change. We also created the San Mateo 
County Women’s Hall of Fame. In 1990, 
Rayna was inducted into the hall of fame she 
helped create. 
San Mateo County is a beautiful place but 
in recent years a troubling undercurrent has 
emerged. The lack of affordable housing 
makes life increasingly difficult for tens of 
thousands. Rayna Lehman has been a strong 
advocate at city councils for affordable hous-
ing and for a livable minimum wage. She can-
not help herself—she believes in the dignity of 
human beings and in the possibility of any 
honest and caring person to contribute greatly 
to our nation. 
As I close these remarks, let me note the 
obvious: Rayna Lehman is a loving person. 
She loves her twin sons Patrick and Benjamin 
and their spouses Amanda and Kelly. She 
loves Bill, a truly fortunate husband. In addi-
tion, Rayna’s expanded family is all of us in 
San Mateo County. She expresses her love by 
protecting and celebrating as many as pos-
sible. 
Rayna is now retiring. The concrete reality 
of human beings fed, ennobled and celebrated 
is evidenced in ways large and enduring 
throughout our county. Farewell Rayna. If that 
guitar is still around, please strike a chord for 
justice. Truth be told, you wrote the song.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
COMMISSION TO COMBAT WORK-
PLACE 
SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT 
ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 17, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the National Commission to Combat 
Workplace Sexual Harassment Act to estab-
lish a national commission to examine and 
combat sexual harassment in the U.S. work-
place. 
I have modeled this bill on legislation Con-
gress has passed to address other national 
problems considered to be serious, such as 
gambling. The almost daily exposure of allega-
tions of sexual harassment, including the re-
cent allegations made against New York Gov-
ernor Andrew Cuomo, more than qualifies sex-
ual harassment for national attention and pri-
ority. This bill would create a national commis-
sion to focus on sexual harassment in major 
industries and workplaces throughout the 
United States. 
Congress has adopted legislation that ad-
dresses harassment in the congressional 
workplace. It requires Members of the House 
and Senate to be personally liable for settle-
ments and awards resulting from harassment 
and retaliation claims, removes mandatory 
counseling, mediation and ‘‘cooling off’’ peri-
ods for accusers that had been required, man-
dates publicly reporting awards and settle-
ments and covers unpaid staff as well. These 
steps move in the right direction beginning 
where Congress should—right here in the 
Congress itself. However, nothing equivalent 
has been done for sexual harassment that af-
fects the American people. We have largely 
neglected our own constituents, despite the in-
creasing number of troubling reports in the 
news of sexual harassment claims. 
A national commission would assure the 
American people that Congress takes sexual 
harassment affecting them—the typical work-
er—seriously, beyond the high-profile exam-
ples, such as allegations against Harvey 
Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Governor Cuomo 
and the Congress itself, that have garnered 
the headlines. Most importantly, the commis-
sion would hear from a cross section of the 
public—from office and factory workers to re-
tail and food service employees—whose expe-
riences with sexual harassment have received 
almost no national attention. The commission 
could travel or invite witnesses to Washington 
from throughout the country to recommend 
changes in laws or regulations and best prac-
tices on preventing, training, investigating, re-
sponding to and penalizing sexual harassment 
in the private and public sectors. 
Our constituents expect Congress, which 
represents every sector, to take on the prob-
lem of sexual harassment throughout our na-
tional economy, including private and public 
(Federal, state and local) workplaces. A na-
tional commission could help reach and re-
duce sexual harassment, a form of gender dis-
crimination, where the average American 
works. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

than two years in the House’s Office of Gen-
eral Counsel as a Deputy General Counsel. 
During her tenure, Ms. Barbero played an inte-
gral role in safeguarding the legal interests of 
the House of Representatives and its Mem-
bers, Officers, and employees in connection 
with federal court litigation involving issues of 
the highest institutional importance. Specifi-
cally, Ms. Barbero provided invaluable legal 
counsel and representation to numerous Com-
mittees of the House, greatly assisting them 
both in fulfilling their constitutionally authorized 
oversight functions and defending those pre-
rogatives in litigation. 
In particular, Ms, Barbero significantly con-
tributed to the development and execution of 
a complex legal and litigation strategy to pro-
tect and defend the authority of the Commit-
tees on Oversight and Reform, Judiciary, Fi-
nancial Services, Ways and Means, and the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
to enforce in federal court compliance with 
congressional subpoenas for personal and 
business records of the President, as well as 
to obtain, by compulsion, official documents 
and testimony from the White House and 
other agencies of the Executive Branch. Ms. 
Barbero’s extensive contributions to the draft-
ing of the written briefs and her performance 
at numerous oral arguments in these cases 
were demonstrations of the finest legal advo-
cacy. 
Additionally, Ms. Barbero provided vital legal 
counsel to the House regarding both presi-
dential impeachments, and with respect to the 
defense of longstanding institutional preroga-
tives, including the House’s constitutional au-
thority under the Appropriations and Rule-
making Clauses. 
Ms. Barbero’s work on behalf of the House 
has been of the highest caliber and I have no 
doubt that the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission will benefit from her outstanding legal 
counsel. On behalf of the entire House com-
munity, I thank Ms. Barbero for her dedicated 
service to the House and I wish for her the 
very best in all of her future endeavors.

RETIREMENT OF RON MILLER 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 17, 2021 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, as co- 
chair of the Labor Caucus, I rise today to com-
mend Ron Miller, the Executive Secretary of 
Los Angeles/Orange Counties Building and 
Construction Trades Council, for his years of 
service. The Building and Construction Trades 
Council represents 150,000 skilled construc-
tion workers in 14 trades and 48 affiliated 
unions and district councils. Throughout his 
time with the council, Ron has helped advo-
cate for workers and fought for education, op-
portunities, and jobs. 
Ron, a 43-year member of the United Asso-
ciation and Pipe trades, rose from the rank- 
and-file of the building trades. He served as 
business representatives for UA Plumbers 
Local 78 and became executive secretary of 
the Building and Construction Trades Council 
in 2012. After 9 years of leading the building 
trades, and 43 years of working for unions, 
Ron retired on August 1, 2021. 
As executive secretary, Ron led negotiations 
for billions of dollars’ worth of project labor 
agreements with public and private entities. 
Through his work, Ron helped guarantee that 
a skilled and trained workforce from building 
trades affiliated unions would be on the job. 
Many of the agreements that Ron worked on 
renew into 2025 and beyond, ensuring that his 
work will continue to help workers for years to 
come. 
Ron led the building trades in fighting for 
change to benefit working people. Throughout 
his time, Ron helped the building trades in ef-
forts to fund education, affordable housing, 
and mass transit. Under Ron’s leadership, the 
Council created the nonprofit Apprenticeship 
Readiness Fund. This fund coordinates more 
than 15 grassroots programs that facilitate 
entry to apprenticeship and lifelong trades ca-
reers. In doing so, Ron has helped the build-
ing trades drive economic equity and guar-
antee that there are avenues to pass on skills 
to the next generation. 
Although Ron has retired, I am confident 
that his legacy will live on in the victories that 
he has fought hard for and delivered on. I am 
so grateful for the opportunity to have worked 
with Ron, and I wish him all the best in his fu-
ture endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE ANDROSCOGGIN 
VALLEY 
AREA 
COVID–19 
RE-
SPONSE TEAM 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 17, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the valiant efforts of the COVID– 
19 Response Team of the Androscoggin Val-
ley Area of Coos County, New Hampshire. 
This group was formed in the early days of the 
pandemic in 2020. 
Recognizing that this would take an all-in ef-
fort, the team consisted of healthcare profes-
sionals, regional social service organizations, 
community EMTs, educational professionals, 
and both the state and Federal detention facili-
ties in the area. 
While working together, this group was able 
to rapidly assess the spread of the pandemic 
and quickly formulate plans to mitigate further 
transmission. Initially this group concentrated 
on testing and contact tracing for positive 
tests. Soon after, local hot spots were quickly 
determined. Their work to promote quarantine 
efforts 
helped 
to 
slow 
the 
pandemic’s 
progress. This outreach took in local nursing 
homes, social services, schools, local busi-
nesses, and more. 
Maintaining social distancing mandates, the 
team met virtually, almost daily, to assess cur-
rent county and state statistics and decide on 
what the next steps would be; all the while 
waiting on the creation and release of a vac-
cine. 
Throughout the pandemic, this multi-dis-
ciplined group of individuals has met every 
challenge and managed to stay ahead of 
every curve. While there have been recent 
spikes in cases, case counts remain below 
state and national percentages. 
It is with pride and my honor to recognize 
this community-minded group of individuals as 
heroes of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
HONORING OLYMPIAN MADELYN 
(MADDY) BERNAU OF WATERFORD 
HON. BRYAN STEIL 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 17, 2021 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Madelyn (Maddy) Bernau. A native of 
Waterford, Wisconsin, Maddy competed for 
Team USA at the 2020 Olympics held this 
year in Tokyo. Maddy was a member of Team 
USA’s Shooting Team and competed in the 
women’s trap and mixed team trap shooting. 
At 23 years old, Maddy became the first Wis-
consinite to win an Olympic trapshooting 
medal on July 31, 2021. 
Maddy’s 
training, 
skill, 
and 
strong 
composure helped her secure a bronze medal 
during the mixed trap shooting competition. 
Maddy and her teammate Brian Burrows were 
up against strong competition from the Slo-
vakian team. The match came down to a 
shoot-off between the Americans and the Slo-
vakians. A miss by the Slovakians gave 
Maddy the window of opportunity she needed 
to win the shoot-off. Seizing the opportunity, 
Maddy pulled the trigger and hit the target, se-
curing the Olympic bronze medal for her team 
and for America. 
Shooting clay targets is something Maddy 
has been perfecting since the age of 12. At 
Waterford High School, Maddy was a stand-
out. She would go on to attend Martin Meth-
odist College in Tennessee where she would 
compete in trap shooting at the collegiate level 
and earn a degree in biology and biomedical 
sciences. In June of 2018, Maddy won her 
first international competition as a member of 
the USA Shooting Team, securing a gold 
medal in the women’s trap at the International 
Junior Grand Prix in Porpetto, Italy. In March 
of 2020, Maddy earned a spot on the U.S. 
Olympic trap shooting team. Her goal of rep-
resenting the United States on the Olympic 
stage would become a reality. 
Maddy represented the United States and 
Southeast Wisconsin with honor. She made 
both her country and community proud with 
her composure, talents, and determination, 
While this is her first Olympic medal, Maddy 
already has her sights set on the next target, 
the 2024 Olympics. I know southeast Wis-
consin will be backing her 100%. 
Maddy’s 
hard 
work 
and 
determination 
throughout the years led to this historic suc-
cess. I was proud to watch Maddy represent 
Wisconsin and the United States on the world 
stage. 
On behalf of Wisconsin’s First Congres-
sional District, I would like to congratulate 
Maddy on her tremendous accomplishment 
and wish her the best of luck.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E905 
August 17, 2021 
Selma, Alabama, under the shadow of the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge, the history of the Civil 
Rights Movement was not something I had to 
learn in school. The foot soldiers of the move-
ment were not names or pictures in a history 
book. They were a vital and vibrant part of my 
community—they were my school teachers, 
church members and my neighbors. 
The Edmund Pettus Bridge loomed large 
over my hometown of Selma, serving as a 
constant reminder, not only of Bloody Sunday, 
but of the national movement that ultimately 
led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
Fifty-six years later, the cause for which the 
foot soldiers, like our beloved colleague John 
Lewis, marched, bled and some died for, is 
now our cause too. Today, old battles have 
become new again as we face the most per-
nicious assault on the right to vote in genera-
tions. It’s clear: federal oversight is urgently 
needed. By preventing states with a recent 
history of voter discrimination from restricting 
the right to vote, the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act restores the full 
promise of our democracy and advances the 
legacy of those brave foot soldiers like John 
Lewis who dedicated their lives for the sacred 
right to vote. 
Over eight years ago, the Supreme Court’s 
Shelby County v. Holder decision gutted key 
provisions of the Voting Rights Act that, for 
decades, prevented states from enacting dis-
criminatory and restrictive voter suppression 
laws. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg wrote 
that ‘‘throwing out preclearance when it has 
worked and is continuing to work to stop dis-
criminatory changes is like throwing away your 
umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not 
getting wet.’’ Justice Ginsburg was right, and 
over eight years later, we are drenched to the 
bone. 
Driven by the Big Lie, state lawmakers have 
introduced over 400 bills in 49 states just this 
year that would restrict the right to vote. In 18 
states, these anti-voter bills have already been 
signed into law. These laws are intended to 
allow politicians to pick and choose whose 
voices are heard by subjecting voters to 
longer lines, inaccessible polling places, strict 
voter ID requirements, broken voting ma-
chines, and purges of voter rolls. 
Furthermore, earlier this summer, the Su-
preme Court weakened another essential sec-
tion of the Voting Rights Act in the Brnovich 
decision by upholding Arizona’s discriminatory 
voter restrictions intended to target Latino and 
other minority voters. 
Let me be clear: Today our nation faces a 
critical juncture. As President Biden said, this 
represents the most significant test of our de-
mocracy since the Civil War. Without congres-
sional action to restore and modernize the 
Voting Rights Act, a fundamental pillar of our 
great democracy will crumble. 
But we have a solution. H.R. 4, the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will re-
store and modernize key provisions of the 
VRA which were gutted by the Supreme 
Court. 
Most importantly, the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act provides Federal 
oversight of states and political subdivisions 
that have a significant and recent history of 
voting rights violations by requiring those with 
a specific number of repeated violations in the 
preceding 25 years to receive preclearance. 
The bill also provides for a practice-based 
preclearance coverage to target those jurisdic-
tions that have enacted measures that have 
historically been used to suppress the right to 
vote. 
Moreover, H.R. 4 clarifies Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act in response to the Supreme 
Court’s recent Brnovich decision where it im-
properly changed congressional intent behind 
the standard for determining vote denial cases 
under the VRA. Other principal provisions of 
H.R. 4 include increased transparency and no-
tice requirements for states and political sub-
divisions, strengthened protections for voters 
before certain discriminatory laws have been 
implemented, and expanded authority for use 
of federal election observers. 
As a daughter of Selma and the Congress-
woman who represents the Civil Rights Dis-
trict, I know the injustices suffered on the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge have not yet been fully 
vindicated. Progress is elusive, and every gen-
eration must fight and fight again to preserve 
the progress of the past and advance it. This 
is our generation’s time to act to protect our 
democracy. 
The need for Congress to pass the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act has 
never been more urgent. 
From our dear friend and colleague John 
Lewis, we learned of the importance of getting 
into necessary trouble—‘‘good trouble.’’ Now 
more than ever, it is time for Congress to act 
to preserve our democracy—to get into ‘‘good 
trouble’’ for the people. 
I urge all my colleagues, both Democrat and 
Republican, to vote in favor of H.R. 4 and to 
restore the full protections of the Voting Rights 
Act.
