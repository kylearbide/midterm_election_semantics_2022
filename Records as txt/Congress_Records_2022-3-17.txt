MINORITY HEALTH DISPARITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise with a great sense of grati-
tude. Gratitude for the opportunity to 
serve the people’s House and gratitude 
for passing my first standalone bill, 
H.R. 189, the John Lewis National In-
stitute on Minority Health and Health 
Disparities Research Endowment Revi-
talization Act. It passed the House and 
Senate, and on a bipartisan basis to 
boot. The bill is on its way to the 
President’s desk, and on Friday, Presi-
dent Joe Biden will sign it in a White 
House ceremony that this kid from the 
harbor area of Los Angeles never 
dreamed was possible. 
This is a full circle moment for me, 
one that made me tear up last night as 
I sat to reflect how I got here and how 
my passion on the issue of disparities 
in health took shape. 
In 1998 as a young college student, I 
had an opportunity to work as an in-
tern in the Clinton White House. I 
worked in the Office of Public Liaison 
doing 
African-American 
outreach 
under Ben Johnson and Minyon Moore. 
It was during my work there that I 
learned about the issue of racial health 
disparities. At the time, United States 
Surgeon General David Satcher high-
lighted the issue, and it became a pas-
sion of mine. 
A year later I would continue my 
work on the issue and in the healthcare 
space at the NAACP with Hilary 
Shelton. 
Ben 
Johnson 
and 
Hilary 
Shelton mentored and inspired me. 
They encouraged me to keep up my 
work on the issue. 
Today, as a Member of Congress, the 
issue of racial health disparities and 
the need for us to close the healthcare 
gap is among my top priorities. In that 
light, during the 116th Congress when I 
was in my second term, an opportunity 
arose to work with organizations like 
the Association of Minority Health 
Professions Schools and others on a 
bill to help fund research on health dis-
parities at schools of excellence. 
I remember approaching our friend, 
the late John Lewis, about the bill. He 
encouraged me to fight and to get it 
across the finish line, and he agreed to 
become an original cosponsor. 
In this Congress, the 117th Congress, 
I renamed the bill in honor of my 
friend, the late John Lewis. H.R. 189 is 
now the John Lewis National Institute 
on Minority Health and Health Dispari-
ties Research Endowment Revitaliza-
tion Act. 
I thank the gentleman from Georgia, 
Representative 
BUDDY
CARTER, 
for 
being a co-lead on the bill. The Senate 
bill, S. 320, was introduced and cham-
pioned by Senators BILL CASSIDY and 
BRIAN SCHATZ. I am grateful for their 
work to get this across the finish line 
and Senator CASSIDY
for being gra-
cious. 
H.R. 189 will, once again, allow for 
current and former NIMHD or Health 
Resources & Services Administration 
Centers of Excellence to receive re-
search endowment funding, money that 
is critical in the fight to reduce minor-
ity health disparities. 
The research endowment program at 
the National Institute on Minority 
Health and Health Disparities provides 
funding to the endowments of academic 
institutions 
across 
the 
country. 
Schools like Charles R. Drew Univer-
sity of Medicine and Science will qual-
ify; Morehouse School of Medicine, the 
University of Puerto Rico School of 
Dental Medicine, Tuskegee University 
College of Veterinary Medicine, Xavier 
University of Louisiana College of 
Pharmacy, and many more will be eli-
gible to receive funding under this bill. 
The goals of the program include pro-
moting minority health and health dis-
parities research capacity and infra-
structure, increasing the diversity and 
strength of the scientific workforce, 
and enhancing the recruitment and re-
tention of individuals from health dis-
parity populations that are underrep-
resented in the scientific workforce. 
On Friday, 24 years after getting my 
start in politics at the White House, I 
will be back there again, this time as a 
Member of Congress to see H.R. 189 be-
come law and move us one step closer 
to ending the disparities in public 
health facing communities of color. 
For that I am grateful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3780 
March 17, 2022 
A PROMISE TO FIRST DO NO 
HARM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, when I first became a doctor, 
I made a promise that I would never 
perform, assist, or support in any abor-
tion or any abortion procedures. All 
doctors take an oath. They swear to 
first do no harm. I made a promise that 
I would never participate in the taking 
of a human life. 
At 10 weeks a baby in their mother’s 
womb has developed a beating heart. 
At 11 weeks, the baby will have devel-
oped elbows, fingers, and toes. And at 
27 weeks, a baby inside the womb can 
hear their mother’s voice. It is clear 
that these children are human—con-
structed in the image of God—and wor-
thy of protection and worthy of love. 
It is time to protect human life, it is 
time to protect the unborn, and it is 
time to end this egregious practice of 
abortion. 
RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF DR. GEORGE HRUZA 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
work of Dr. George Hruza. 
A graduate of New York University, 
Dr. Hruza went on to complete both a 
dermatology residency at New York 
University Medical Center as well as a 
laser surgery fellowship at Harvard 
Medical School. Later, Dr. Hruza com-
pleted a Mohs and dermatologic sur-
gery fellowship at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison 
with 
Dr. 
Fred 
Mohs. 
Dr. Fred Mohs developed this revolu-
tionary surgery—a technique that al-
lows for the precise removal and the re-
pair of skin cancer. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Hruza has 
proven himself to be a leader in the 
field of dermatology. His tireless com-
mitment to his patients and their fami-
lies has undoubtedly saved countless 
lives. 
Dr. Hruza has come to Washington 
and done skin cancer screenings for 
members of staff and Members of Con-
gress—several who might be present 
here today. 
As the American Academy of Der-
matology’s president, Dr. Hruza’s re-
lentless advocacy for innovation has 
helped to shape the way that skin can-
cer today is treated in the United 
States. Skin cancers were previously 
deadly. My own grandfather died from 
skin cancer, a skin cancer that would 
be treated today by someone like Dr. 
Hruza and cured. 
It is my privilege to call Dr. George 
Hruza a leader, a colleague, and a 
friend of the United States Congress. 
As he continues his work as the United 
Skin Specialists Missouri director, I 
wish Dr. Hruza every continued suc-
cess; his success in working to treat 
patients, his success in developing in-
novation, and his success as one of the 
leaders in dermatology not just in the 
United States but throughout the 
world. 
f 
CAREER AND TECHNOLOGY 
EDUCATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, as the coauthor of the bipar-
tisan Strengthening Career and Tech-
nical Education in the 21st Century 
Act—the largest reform of skills-based 
education in more than a dozen years— 
I rise today to celebrate one institu-
tion that has become a national exem-
plar. 
I am honored to join Congressman 
AUGUST PFLUGER from Texas in recog-
nizing Dr. Gregory Williams at Odessa 
College. Odessa College has been named 
a top-10 community college by the 
Aspen Institute. Dr. Williams has seen 
both enrollment as well as students 
with passing grades increase year after 
year. 
When we reformed CTE in 2018 and 
increased Federal funding by over 10 
percent, we did so with educators like 
Dr. Williams in mind. 
I commend Dr. Williams and Odessa 
College for their tremendous success. I 
will continue fighting for robust fund-
ing for skills-based and vocational edu-
cation funding so that programs like 
Odessa’s can flourish in my State of Il-
linois as well as across the country. 
f 
NATIONAL AMERICORPS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, this 
week many people will be celebrating 
National AmeriCorps Week. I will not 
be one of them. AmeriCorps has been 
around for almost 30 years, and in that 
time we have learned never to under-
estimate the ability of the Federal 
Government to muck things up. 
No one denies that AmeriCorps began 
with good intentions, and I applaud the 
philanthropic spirit of those who vol-
unteer out of a genuine desire to help 
those in need. However, I cannot ap-
plaud a bloated bureaucratic organiza-
tion that is the poster child for fraud 
and mismanagement. 
AmeriCorps is entrusted with 1.1 bil-
lion taxpayer dollars every single year. 
And every single year AmeriCorps 
proves it is an expert at wasting tax-
payer funds. 
For example, some AmeriCorps pro-
grams cost taxpayers four to eight 
times more money than programs that 
perform identical services. Even more 
concerning is the fact that neither 
Congress, the Inspector General, nor 
AmeriCorps itself have an idea of how 
taxpayer dollars are being managed. In 
fact, AmeriCorps’ financial statements 
are so bad that they have not been able 
to be audited for the past 5 years. 
According to AmeriCorps’ Inspector 
General, if this occurred at a private 
organization there would be a ‘‘whole-
sale resignation or firing of the leader-
ship team, and the public would be 
shorting their stock.’’ 
Even more concerning is the lack of 
oversight AmeriCorps provides over its 
grantees that are plagued with fraudu-
lent activity. For example, a Hawaiian 
nonprofit executive was recently sen-
tenced to 46 months in prison for em-
bezzling over $500,000 from AmeriCorps, 
and a school district in St. Louis was 
found 
guilty 
of 
encouraging 
AmeriCorps volunteers to falsely in-
flate time sheets. 
The private sector often does the 
same work as AmeriCorps but at a 
fraction of the price and with far less 
waste, fraud, and mismanagement. 
It is our job as Members of the House 
of Representatives to ensure that tax-
payer funds are protected. The power of 
the purse is one of our most important 
constitutional duties. We therefore 
must stop feeding the black hole that 
is AmeriCorps and instead empower 
States and local governments to meet 
the needs of their residents. 
The last time AmeriCorps’ programs 
were reauthorized was in 2009 with the 
passage of the Edward M. Kennedy 
Serve America Act which was named in 
honor of the late Senator who was the 
author of the legislation that governs 
many of AmeriCorps’ programs. 
Yet, despite the support for national 
service, Senator Kennedy himself em-
phasized the importance of proper 
stewardship of taxpayer dollars, noting 
during a 1993 floor speech on the estab-
lishment of the corporation that ‘‘Con-
gress will not, and should not, fund a 
program if it is unsuccessful.’’ 
I agree with him. AmeriCorps has 
had 29 years to prove itself, and the 
only thing it has proven is that it is a 
drain on taxpayers and a massive dis-
appointment. This is a failed agency 
that needs to be overhauled completely 
or just eliminated.

CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT 
BIDEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Presi-
dent Biden for the progress our Nation 
has made this past year. In early 2021, 
the President took office during a glob-
al crisis and was determined to get 
America back on track. He knew we 
needed a comeback. He knew we needed 
to focus on building a better America. 
So what did President Biden do? He 
invested in the American people, and 
he invested big. The boom was begin-
ning. 
In March 2021, the American Rescue 
Plan was signed into law. In total, a 
historic $1.9 trillion were put to work 
for the American people during the se-
vere public health and economic crisis 
caused by COVID.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3781 
March 17, 2022 
Since then, the American Rescue 
Plan has been helping us recover. We 
are now enjoying one of the strongest 
periods of economic growth in history, 
and we are building a better America. 
If we look at the progress we have 
made over the past year, Madam 
Speaker, we can see how successful the 
American Rescue Plan truly has been. 
The plan powered historic jobs recov-
ery and produced the largest calendar 
increase in jobs on record. The unem-
ployment rate dropped at a record 
pace, but we have also seen the biggest 
drop in long-term unemployment ever 
recorded in a 12-month span. Nearly 2.5 
million people broke out of the cycle of 
long-term 
unemployment. 
Madam 
Speaker, this is huge. 
As the Representative of a majority 
Latino district, I was especially proud 
to learn there were record drops in 
Latino and African-American unem-
ployment rates. African-American un-
employment fell by more than 30 per-
cent. Latino unemployment fell from 
nearly 9 percent to 4.4 percent, the 
fastest drop ever recorded. 
These are hardworking Americans 
going back to work, putting food on 
the table, and earning good paychecks. 
This is building a better America. 
We have seen that when Americans 
have job opportunities, great things 
happen, and they do. That is why we 
also saw the lowest number of home 
foreclosures ever recorded. We also wit-
nessed a record low number of credit 
card delinquencies. 
The American Rescue Plan isn’t only 
helping working adults. The American 
Rescue Plan’s historic child tax credit 
benefits nearly 40 million families with 
65 million children. 
Madam Speaker, in my own home 
State, the child tax credit directly ben-
efits nearly 7 million children, many in 
our area of Houston. Madam Speaker, 
that is a whole lot of children. Most 
families in Texas will receive several 
thousand extra dollars because of the 
increased 2021 child tax credit. 
Because of these historic tax credits, 
child poverty rates have been slashed 
dramatically. In only 1 year, unem-
ployment is at a record low, job oppor-
tunities are on the rise, and child pov-
erty rates have been reduced. We are 
building a better America for all. 
I am so proud we have a strong leader 
in the White House who is leading 
America to full recovery. President 
Biden got it right, Madam Speaker. He 
understood that betting on the Amer-
ican people is always a good idea. With 
the right resources, America will win. 
We will all win. It is just that simple. 
Together, we really are building a bet-
ter America. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF 
DAVID RUDD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to talk about the legacy of 
David Rudd, who is retiring as the 
president of the University of Mem-
phis. 
Dr. David Rudd came to the Univer-
sity of Memphis in 2013 as the provost 
for the university. He had previously 
served as the dean of the College of So-
cial and Behavioral Science and sci-
entific director of the National Center 
for Veterans Studies at the University 
of Utah. 
President Rudd succeeded Dr. Shirley 
Raines as president and Brad Martin as 
interim president of the University of 
Memphis, becoming the University of 
Memphis president in 2014. 
The University of Memphis has a stu-
dent population of around 22,000 stu-
dents, with 17 bachelor’s degrees in 
more than 250 areas of studies, mas-
ter’s degrees in 54 subjects, doctoral de-
grees in 26 disciplines, and graduate 
certificate programs in 44 areas of 
study. The University of Memphis also 
has one of the finest law schools in the 
southeast United States. 
No matter your alma mater, one 
thing most can agree on is that it is ex-
tremely challenging leading a school of 
higher education today, especially in 
the era of COVID. 
With that said, the University of 
Memphis has flourished under David 
Rudd’s tenure as president. There have 
been a number of major accomplish-
ments during this time. Maybe the 
most significant achievement during 
the David Rudd era is the University of 
Memphis obtaining the research classi-
fication known as R1 by the Carnegie 
Classification of Institutions of Higher 
Education. For the first time in its his-
tory, this puts the University of Mem-
phis in the top tier of research univer-
sities across the Nation. 
I asked my friend, Doug Edwards, the 
chairman of the Board of Trustees of 
the University of Memphis, about 
David Rudd. Doug told me: ‘‘David 
Rudd is a transformative leader who 
has had a profound impact on the Uni-
versity of Memphis. He has elevated 
the stature of the university to that of 
the second flagship university in Ten-
nessee and a top-tier research institu-
tion.’’ 
Soon Dr. Rudd will take a well-de-
served sabbatical from his leadership 
and administrative duties. When he 
comes back to the University of Mem-
phis in the next year, he will return to 
teaching and research as a distin-
guished professor of psychology and 
will run the new Rudd Institute for 
Veteran and Military Suicide Preven-
tion at the University of Memphis. 
The institute is appropriately named. 
As a veteran of the Gulf war and a 
former Army psychologist, David Rudd 
is one of the Nation’s leading experts 
on suicide prevention among our Na-
tion’s veterans. 
We wish the utmost best to him and 
his wife, Dr. Loretta Rudd, herself a 
distinguished educator and researcher 
in higher education. 
On behalf of the many alumni and 
residents of the Eighth Congressional 
District of Tennessee, Roberta and I 
congratulate, salute, and honor David 
Rudd for his remarkable and out-
standing tenure as the president of the 
University of Memphis. 
f 
HONORING REVEREND FRED 
SHUTTLESWORTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a true civil rights pio-
neer, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, 
ahead of what would have been his 
100th birthday on Friday, March 18. 
Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth was a 
civil rights activist who led the fight 
against segregation and other forms of 
racism as a minister in Birmingham, 
Alabama. He was a cofounder of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference, initiated and was instrumental 
in the 1963 Birmingham campaign, also 
known as Project C, for confrontation, 
to desegregate the city of Birmingham. 
Regarded as one of the most coura-
geous civil rights fighters in the South 
by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rev-
erend Shuttlesworth was a fearless 
freedom fighter who always stood up 
for what is right. 
Shuttlesworth participated in the 
sit-ins 
against 
segregated 
lunch 
counters in 1960 and took part in the 
organization and completion of the 
Freedom Riders in 1961. 
Throughout his amazing career, de-
spite experiencing violent intimidation 
and numerous attempts on his life, 
Reverend Shuttlesworth remained vigi-
lant in his fight for civil rights. The 
noted pastor of the Bethel Baptist 
Church is recognized as the key leader 
and organizer of the civil rights move-
ment in Birmingham, Alabama. 
In recognition of his lifelong dedica-
tion, President Clinton awarded Rev-
erend Shuttlesworth the Presidential 
Citizens Medal in 2001. Shortly after, in 
2008, the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth 
International Airport was named in his 
honor. 
Although 
Reverend 
Shuttlesworth 
died at the age of 89 on October 5 of 
2011, he has a long list of accomplish-
ments. To that, the city of Bir-
mingham is designating this Friday, 
March 
18, 
as 
the 
Reverend 
Shuttlesworth Day in honor of the 
100th anniversary of his birthday. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me and the city of Birmingham 
to pay tribute to the extraordinary life 
and 
legacy 
of 
Reverend 
Fred 
Shuttlesworth as we designate March 
18 as Reverend Shuttlesworth Day. 
HONORING MRS. BEATRICE PRICE 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the remarkable life and 
legacy of Beatrice Price, a pioneering 
Army nurse to the Tuskegee Airmen 
during World War II, who passed away 
at the age of 98 on March 4, 2022. 
Joining the military shortly after 
completing nursing school, Mrs. Price

honorably served alongside the leg-
endary Tuskegee Airmen until her dis-
charge in 1948. 
A trailblazer and pioneer in the field 
of nursing, Mrs. Price had a stellar 42- 
year career in nursing, spending more 
than 34 years working at the Bir-
mingham VA Medical Center where she 
once again cared for our servicemen 
and servicewomen with great distinc-
tion until her retirement in January of 
1988. 
On a personal note, Mrs. Price was a 
source of great inspiration for me and 
so many young women. She was de-
voted to her church, her family, and 
her service to this Nation. A woman of 
tremendous faith, Mrs. Price served 
honorably during World War II along-
side the legendary Tuskegee Airmen. 
As Alabama’s first Black Congress-
woman, it was my high honor to be-
stow upon her a Congressional Gold 
Medal for her courage, bravery, and ex-
emplary service. I was also thrilled to 
host Mrs. Price in Washington at the 
State of the Union in 2013. 
For her many accomplishments, Mrs. 
Price was always gracious, always 
compassionate, and always humble. I 
am eternally grateful for our friend-
ship, her mentorship, and our special 
bond. I thank her family for sharing 
her with the world. 
May we find comfort in knowing that 
she lived a full and blessed life. Her 
legacy will live on in the hearts and ac-
tions of those she impacted. Rest in 
peace and power, thy good and faithful 
servant. 
On behalf of Alabama’s Seventh Con-
gressional District, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing the extraor-
dinary life and legacy of Mrs. Beatrice 
Price and her tremendous service to 
this Nation.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
AGRICULTURE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize National Agriculture Week, which 
begins on March 20, a week dedicated 
to honoring and acknowledging the ef-
forts and hard work of American farm-
ers and farm families. 
While farmers, ranchers, producers, 
foresters, and farmworkers should be 
celebrated year-round, National Agri-
culture Week shines a bright light on 
where our Nation’s food, fiber, and fuel 
come from. I have always said every 
American interacts with agriculture at 
least three times a day, whether they 
realize it or not: breakfast, lunch, and 
dinner. It is a fundamental part of our 
lives, and it is the backbone of the 
American economy. 
Celebrated 
during 
National 
Agri-
culture Week, National Agriculture 
Day began in 1973 as a way to recognize 
the unique value that farmers, ranch-
ers, and foresters contribute to our so-
ciety, contributions that have only 
grown in importance over the past 2 
years as the world faced a pandemic, 
global supply chain disruptions, eco-
nomic instability, and, now, war in Eu-
rope. 
Being a farmer has never been an 
easy job by any means. Feeding and 
clothing our Nation and the entire 
world is a monumental task. Every 
day, America’s farm families dedicate 
their minds and bodies to achieving 
that feat. 
Unfortunately, many farmers today 
are facing rising input costs, shrinking 
profit margins, and unrelenting supply 
chain issues, much of which has been 
self-inflicted by leadership in Wash-
ington, yet they continue to persevere. 
As Republican leader of the House 
Agriculture Committee, I am honored 
to represent farm families in rural 
America and serve as their reliable 
voice in the Halls of Congress. 
National Agriculture Week encour-
ages every American to: understand 
how food and fiber products are pro-
duced; appreciate the role agriculture 
plays in providing a safe, abundant, 
and affordable food supply; value the 
essential role of agriculture in our 
economy; and acknowledge and con-
sider successful career opportunities in 
the agriculture industry. 
As the Representative of Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th Congressional District, I 
have the great privilege of working 
firsthand with many farmers and for-
esters. In the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, we are fortunate to have 
more than 59,000 farms. These men and 
women work hard to feed and clothe 
not just Pennsylvanians but our Nation 
and overseas. Their hard work results 
in agriculture being Pennsylvania’s 
number one industry. 
Agriculture and its associated indus-
tries contribute more than $135 billion, 
or about 18 percent of Pennsylvania’s 
economy. The industry employs half a 
million workers, including 280,500 di-
rect jobs. 
I will end with one of my favorite 
quotes about agriculture from Presi-
dent Jefferson: ‘‘Agriculture . . . is our 
wisest pursuit, because it will in the 
end contribute most to real wealth, 
good morals, and happiness.’’ 
This sentiment rings just as true 
today as it did in President Jefferson’s 
letter to George Washington in 1787. 
Our farm families truly embody the 
best of the American spirit through 
their moral integrity, hard work, and 
an unwavering dedication to their 
craft. Everyone in this Chamber and 
around the world benefits from the 
‘‘wise pursuit’’ of agriculture, and we 
owe these patriots a resounding debt of 
gratitude. 
I want to applaud the farmers, ranch-
ers, and foresters who continue to de-
vote their lives to American agri-
culture.

RUSSIA IS COMMITTING WAR 
CRIMES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, the House of Representa-
tives heard from Ukrainian President 
Zelenskyy as he painted a haunting 
picture of pain inflicted on the Ukrain-
ian people and the war crimes being 
waged on Ukrainians trying to keep 
themselves and their families safe. 
It is clear, Madam Speaker, that 
Vladimir Putin has committed war 
crimes 
by 
violating 
international 
norms, including the Geneva Conven-
tion, in his violent and bloody war of 
conquest on Ukraine. 
I, along with Congressman DAVID 
CICILLINE, 
have 
introduced 
a 
war 
crimes resolution, H. Res. 964, calling 
on the global community to hold Vladi-
mir Putin and the Russian Government 
accountable for these war crimes. 
Russian forces have used explosive 
weapons with wide-range effects near 
schools and populated areas, hitting 
them with missiles, rockets, and heavy 
artillery. It is clearly a violation of the 
Geneva Convention to target civilian 
and cultural sites. 
On March 1, a Russian airstrike hit 
Freedom Square in Kharkiv, killing ci-
vilians and injuring dozens of innocent 
people. 
On March 1, a Russian missile hit the 
location of the Babyn Yar Holocaust 
Memorial site, a place where thousands 
of Jewish people were killed between 
1941 and 1943. 
On March 3, 47 civilians were killed 
when Russia hit two schools and apart-
ment buildings, injuring countless oth-
ers. This is clearly a violation of the 
Geneva Convention. 
We have also witnessed the attack of 
medical units. On March 9, Russian 
forces bombed a maternity and chil-
dren’s hospital in the city of Mariupol. 
The world watched as a pregnant 
woman was being carried lifeless from 
the hospital wreckage on a stretcher. 
Both she and her child passed away. 
The World Health Organization has 
also confirmed several attacks on 
healthcare centers in Ukraine, causing 
countless deaths and injuries. 
It is clearly a violation of the Geneva 
Convention to target nuclear facilities. 
On 
March 
3, 
Ukrainian 
President 
Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of 
nuclear terror as Russian tanks shot at 
the nuclear blocks at a nuclear power 
station in Ukraine. 
More than 3 million people are now 
refugees 
who 
have 
fled 
Ukraine, 
Madam Speaker. Each day in Ukraine, 
more than 70,000 children have become 
refugees. That accounts for 55 children 
fleeing the country every minute. 
There have been over 2,000 civilian 
casualties in the country, and thou-
sands upon thousands of people have

been injured. Yesterday, the Inter-
national Court of Justice overwhelm-
ingly found that Russia must imme-
diately suspend its unlawful military 
invasion of Ukraine. 
It is clear, Madam Speaker, that 
Vladimir Putin and the Russian Gov-
ernment have committed war crimes. 
They have invaded a sovereign nation 
and are attacking the very core of lib-
erty and democracy. We must hold 
them accountable and do all we can to 
support the brave Ukrainians fighting 
for their freedom. 
f 
AVOID WAR THROUGH FINANCIAL 
EXCELLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BUSTOS). The Chair recognizes the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CAWTHORN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
when American projects weakness on 
the 
international 
stage, 
everyday 
Americans suffer. We know this. We 
are told this daily. But many everyday 
Americans feel that geopolitics is far 
removed from their lives. 
So, let’s answer the question: What 
does it cost for America to be weak on 
the world stage? 
This cost is manifested at the pumps 
every day with 42 percent higher 
prices. It is shown as food prices soar. 
Meat, poultry, and eggs are all up over 
10 percent. 
Our weakness abroad produces hard-
ships at home. If we lose our role as the 
world reserve currency, your buying 
power, your savings, and your property 
value could all sink to historic lows. 
The preeminence of American cur-
rency has dominated the global land-
scape for decades, providing stability 
as the international bedrock of finan-
cial transactions and arrangements. 
We are the world’s reserve currency. 
We are the standard. But that great fi-
nancial heritage is slipping away. Our 
children may soon call the world re-
serve currency by another name. Per-
haps they will know it as the yuan. 
The geopolitical ramifications of de-
valued and discarded American cur-
rency would not only signal a shift in 
financial confidence in the United 
States; it would dissolve our standing 
among global superpowers. 
We are witnessing the death rattle of 
Pax Americana, meaning the era of 
American peace we have enjoyed in the 
world for decades. 
America could lose a war with China 
without a single shot ever being fired if 
our dollar continues to be perpetually 
devalued. 
Permanent 
Washington 
decision-
makers, most of whom are over 30 to 50 
years my senior, have clearly either 
not taken the time to sit and consider 
the cost of or, worse, simply ignored 
how hyperinflation is rotting the supe-
riority of our Nation’s currency and 
dragging with it young families, blue- 
collar workers, and the great American 
middle class. 
American strength and leadership 
have been the driving force of peace for 
the last half century. Nations unified 
behind the stability of the U.S. dollar, 
in large part because we backed our 
greenbacks with gold—substance, not 
fluff. We were the manufacturers of the 
world. The shift from a gold standard 
to a fiat currency began to starve 
America’s financial preeminence. You 
cannot inflate gold, but you can print 
money out of thin air. When a currency 
is built on nothing but paper, it lit-
erally grows on trees. With this dra-
matic shift, America’s leverage on the 
world stage began to slip away. 
There can be no globalism when 
America refuses to relinquish its posi-
tion as the preeminent currency. Coun-
tries also think twice before incurring 
the wrath of the United States when 
their own financial stability is tied to 
the endurance of our monetary system. 
But, instead, our inflated, hollow 
monetary systems have given way to 
fantastical foreign policy. We have sur-
rendered our financial security as the 
superpowers of the world wait eagerly 
in the wings. Our collapse signals their 
emergence. 
Saudi Arabia, which has exclusively 
sold its oil using U.S. dollars, is now 
considering selling oil for the Chinese 
yuan. The Chinese Communist Party 
has been posturing for years to topple 
the dollar with their tender. 
When the U.S. dollar falls, America 
will no longer remain dominant on the 
world stage, and peace will end. It is al-
ready happening. Vladimir Putin has 
illegally 
and 
immorally 
invaded 
Ukraine. The world is coming unrav-
eled as our tender’s resiliency plum-
mets. 
But I am sure you are asking your-
self at home: Does this have to happen? 
In short, the answer is no. We can re-
claim the mantle of financial excel-
lence we once held. We can become the 
leader of the world again without hav-
ing to expend the lives of young Ameri-
cans. 
Stooping to military interventionism 
is the goal of the war hawks here in 
Congress who are bought and paid for 
by those who stand to profit from for-
ever wars. 
If we are wise and shrewd, we can 
avoid ever needing to put boots on the 
ground to ensure peace. We can do this 
by dominating the world’s economy. 
To bring peace without bloodshed is 
actually quite simple. The key is to 
immediately reduce gas prices and en-
ergy prices by drilling the hell out of 
the Permian Basin and by granting 
every lease and incentivizing all nec-
essary infrastructure atop the Bakken 
shale. 
Furthermore, we should aggressively 
onshore manufacturing back to Amer-
ica, dominate the world market on pre-
cious minerals, and stop shipping our 
jobs overseas. 
A strong American economy creates 
a strong U.S. currency. When America 
sits atop the world, peace will con-
tinue. Tyrants of the world, like Putin 
and Xi Jinping, will fear us when the 
only way to buy and sell energy is by 
using the U.S. dollar. 
It is our solemn responsibility to 
pass a peaceful and prosperous nation 
on to the next generation. We are the 
leaders of the world. It is time we start 
acting like it. 
Drill, baby, drill. America first now, 
and America first forever. 
f 
BROAD-BASED SANCTIONS ARE 
ECONOMIC WARFARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the Ukrainian 
people who are facing a cruel and inhu-
mane war of aggression from a tyrant, 
Vladimir Putin. 
I also stand in solidarity with my 
Ukrainian-American 
constituents 
whose friends and families are in 
harm’s way. 
We must address this war with cour-
age, foresight, and humility. I am ap-
palled by the extraordinary cruelty of 
Putin’s war. I am also moved by the 
courage of the Ukrainians and also by 
the courage of the antiwar protesters 
in Russia, risking 15 years in prison for 
speaking out against Putin’s aggres-
sion. 
We must stand unified with the 
Ukrainian people. But even as we stand 
with the Ukrainian people, we must 
avoid the knee-jerk calls to make this 
conflict even worse. 
One thing we should have learned 
throughout our history is that policy 
decisions we make simply based on fear 
or rage rarely end well. Increasingly, 
we are hearing voices calling for the 
United States and NATO to enter into 
war with Russia. For the most part, 
they are not saying this directly. They 
are using euphemisms like no-fly zone. 
A no-fly zone is not simply declared. 
It must be militarily enforced. As the 
President said, a no-fly zone would 
mean the United States entering the 
war. It would mean the beginning of 
World War III. 
We must reject this completely. The 
stakes are incredibly high. There has 
never been, on this Earth, a war be-
tween two or more nuclear powers. 
There is a reason for this. Even in 
the madness of the Cold War, leaders 
around the world understood that nu-
clear war would mean the annihilation 
of humanity. 
There 
are 
voices 
now 
that 
are 
shockingly casual about the risk of nu-
clear war. I am asking the American 
people to not believe them. Do not be-
lieve them when they tell you that it is 
going to be limited. Do not believe 
them when they tell you nuclear win-
ter isn’t real, or it isn’t that bad. They 
don’t know that. They can’t know that. 
Aside from the very real risk of nu-
clear escalation, we have placed the 
strictest sanctions in history on Russia 
with no clear off-ramps or criteria for 
lifting them. 
What is clear is that broad-based 
sanctions will be devastating for civil-
ians. What is less clear is that Putin or

his inner circle will be hurt or deterred 
by them. As Secretary Albright told 
me in a committee in 2019: ‘‘We have 
learned that comprehensive sanctions 
. . . hurt the people.’’ 
Collective punishment is a moral 
evil, especially when it is authorized 
with no end in sight. The embargo in 
Cuba has been in place for over 60 
years. It has caused incredible human 
suffering. It has not produced its in-
tended outcome. 
Maximum pressure sanctions on Iran 
and Venezuela have made it hard for 
people living in those countries to buy 
food and medicine, but it has done 
nothing to weaken their governments. 
We also know that there are a num-
ber of countries who depend on Russia 
and Ukraine for their food supplies. 
Russia and Ukraine produce one-third 
of the world’s wheat. Already, there 
are reports their countries are refusing 
to export their own food supplies for 
fear of a shrinking supply. 
There is a very real chance that this 
war and our sanctions could lead to 
famine in places like Sudan, which im-
ports half of its wheat from Russia. 
The Russian people did not choose this 
war, and the Sudanese people certainly 
did not. Our policies should not punish 
them. 
I don’t support broad-based sanctions 
on any country, adversary, or ally. 
They are economic warfare, and we 
should all oppose them like we oppose 
military actions. 
b 1045 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
war 
was 
sparked by greed, imperialism, and de-
humanization. We must lead with hu-
manity. Let us stand with not just the 
people of Ukraine who are giving their 
lives fighting off a cruel war of con-
quest, but also the brave Russian dis-
sidents who are risking their own lives 
to stand up to Putin. 
Let’s stand for a world where the rule 
of law is respected, human rights abus-
ers face justice, and we see each other 
first and foremost as fellow humans. 
Madam Speaker, I pray for wisdom. I 
pray for justice. Above all, I pray for 
peace.

CONGRATULATING THE BEARDEN 
HIGH SCHOOL LADY BULLDOGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the Bearden 
High School Lady Bulldogs basketball 
team for winning their first Tennessee 
Secondary School Athletic Association 
title in program history. Bearden won 
the Class 4A State championship game 
on March 12, defeating the Farragut 
Lady Admirals 52–34. 
Both teams reached the State tour-
nament after a season’s worth of perse-
verance and teamwork. The Lady Bull-
dogs compiled 36 wins during the reg-
ular season while the Lady Admirals 
won 39 games. In the State tour-
nament, Bearden and Farragut sailed 
through 
the 
quarterfinals 
and 
semifinals to set up a clash with each 
other in the championship game. It was 
the fifth time these two teams met 
during the season. 
This was a historic matchup, Madam 
Speaker. Neither Bearden nor Farragut 
had appeared in a girls’ State cham-
pionship game before that. It also 
marked the first time two Knox Coun-
ty schools competed against each other 
in the State championship game. Re-
gardless of the winner of this game, 
Knox County would have its first girls’ 
basketball State championship team 
since the Austin-East Roadrunners won 
it all in 2007. 
As a Bearden High School alumnus, I 
am excited that my Lady Bulldogs 
were victorious in the championship, 
but I represent both these communities 
in Congress. The Lady Admirals should 
be proud of what they achieved this 
year, and I am happy to recognize Far-
ragut for an incredibly successful sea-
son. Both squads did an excellent job 
representing east Tennessee in the 
State tournament. Congratulations to 
the girls and their coaches. Go, Bull-
dogs. 
CONGRATULATING UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE’S 
BASKETBALL PROGRAMS 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the University of 
Tennessee’s basketball programs on 
making their respective 2022 NCAA 
tournaments. By punching their tick-
ets to the big dance, both the men’s 
and women’s teams built on UT ath-
letics’ long history of college basket-
ball success. 
The University of Tennessee is the 
only school to qualify for every wom-
en’s NCAA tournament. The women’s 
program is making its 40th straight— 
40th straight, Madam Speaker—NCAA 
tournament appearance after winning 
23 contests during the regular season. 
Competing as the number four seed in 
the Wichita region, the Lady Volun-
teers won’t need to travel far for their 
first game of the tournament. Thomp-
son-Boling Arena will host it in Knox-
ville. This venue will be the first for 
this year’s competition, which is where 
the Lady Volunteers will take on the 
Buffalo Bulls on March 19. 
On the men’s side, the Volunteers de-
feated the Texas A&M Aggies last Sat-
urday to win the 2022 Southeastern 
Conference tournament championship. 
It is not in my notes, but I do want to 
note, since Representative BARR might 
be watching this, we also defeated Ken-
tucky very handily also. This is the 
fifth tournament championship in pro-
gram history and the first since 1979. 
The team earned the number three seed 
in the South Region for its regular sea-
son 
performance 
and 
faces 
the 
Longwood Lancers in the first round 
this afternoon in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
I wish the best of luck to the Lady 
Volunteers head coach Kellie Harper 
and the Volunteers men’s head coach 
Rick Barnes, all their players, coaches, 
and support staff as they compete in 
this year’s NCAA’s basketball tour-
nament. I was also an alumnus of the 
University of Tennessee, and I still 
have 4 years of eligibility left in bas-
ketball. Go Vols. 
BUDDY’S BAR-B-Q CELEBRATES 50 YEARS 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of Buddy’s Bar-b-q, a local favorite in 
east Tennessee, and one of my local fa-
vorites as well. My mama and daddy 
and I always used to eat there after 
church on Sundays. It was always deli-
cious. I ate there with my best friend 
Chris Heagerty last week, and it was 
still delicious, and it was very price 
conscious, I will say. It is not too ex-
pensive. 
Buddy 
and 
LaMuriel 
Smothers 
dreamed of opening a restaurant that 
served quality, homestyle barbecue 
with classic southern hospitality. In 
1972, they made that dream a reality by 
opening the first Buddy’s Bar-b-q in 
Knoxville. It quickly became a hit. 
Crowds packed into the restaurant to 
enjoy 
LaMuriel’s 
delicious 
recipes, 
which are still on the menu today, and 
listen to the wonderful bluegrass bands 
that played on Friday nights. I remem-
ber a band called Knoxville Grass used 
to play there, and I would sing a little 
bit of the tunes here, but I don’t want 
to run everybody off or be called out. 
Ten years later, of course, Buddy’s 
Bar-b-q 
was 
featured 
at 
the 
1982 
World’s Fair in Knoxville, where I 
worked at the always very loud and im-
pressive video expo. After appearing at 
the fair, though, the word spread far 
and wide that Buddy’s Bar-b-q was out-
standing. The restaurant became a bar-
becue staple in Tennessee, a reputation 
that it has maintained for the past 40 
years. 
Complementing the outstanding food 
at Buddy’s Bar-b-q are the restaurant’s 
charitable efforts in our community. 
The restaurant launched Buddy’s Race 
for the Cure to honor Buddy after he 
died of cancer in 1992 and supports Alz-
heimer’s 
Tennessee 
in 
honor 
of 
LaMuriel. It also hosts Mission Mon-
days and supports local schools, re-
gional nonprofits, and the University 
of Tennessee. Additionally, Buddy’s 
Bar-b-q will provide catering and sup-
port for the Congressional Medal of 
Honor Society’s annual gathering to 
honor all the living Medal of Honor re-
cipients. This event is again being held 
in Knoxville this year for the second 
time, and Buddy’s will provide classic 
southern hospitality. 
I congratulate the entire Smothers 
family; my good friends Anthony and 
Lisa 
Edwards, 
Mark 
and 
Jaime 
Lemoncelli; and everyone involved in 
making Buddy’s Bar-b-q a wonderful 
success these past 50 years. It is good. 
If you all ever get to Knoxville, please 
stop in.

March 17, 2022 
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT 
ON ENERGY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. CASTEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, Vladi-
mir Putin’s horrific war against the 
Ukrainian people has all of us talking 
about how to prevent him and other 
oil-rich autocrats like him from being 
able to afford to commit these heinous 
acts in the future. It has also, all of a 
sudden, made everybody in this town 
an energy expert. I am here to set the 
record straight about a few things. 
One, Russia is a petrostate. Fossil 
fuels are funding Putin’s war crimes 
against the Ukrainian people. Fossil 
fuels are funding Putin’s assault on de-
mocracy. Fossil fuels are funding the 
demise of post-World War II stability 
in Europe. Putin’s power comes from 
fossil fuels and our world’s dependence 
on them. 
Two, you cannot end an addiction by 
increasing the supply. No amount of in-
creased fossil fuel extraction in the 
United States, which, I should note, 
would take years, can take away Rus-
sia’s influence on the global energy 
market. Since fossil fuels are a global 
commodity, as long as we depend on 
them, Americans will continue to be 
subject to wild price fluctuations based 
on the whims of petro-dictators. 
Three, when the fossil fuel industry 
and the conservative politicians they 
bankroll go on television claiming the 
solution to the pain you are feeling at 
the pump today is to drill more in the 
U.S., they are lying to you. They are 
lying in a cynical attempt to take ad-
vantage of a tragic situation to line 
their own pocketbooks. You deserve 
the truth. 
The truth is that there is only one 
long-term solution to stop funding oil- 
rich autocrats and insulate Americans 
from energy price inflation: Double 
down on our transition to cleaner, 
cheaper, domestically produced renew-
able energy and energy efficiency. 
The horror that we are seeing in 
Ukraine makes it abundantly clear 
that clean energy isn’t just necessary 
to protect against climate devastation. 
Preventing wars and protecting our na-
tional security demands investments in 
clean energy. American energy inde-
pendence 
demands 
investments 
in 
clean energy. Lowering costs demands 
investments in clean energy. 
Every day we fail to reach an agree-
ment on the baseline climate invest-
ments that were passed in the House is 
a day that Americans pay the price at 
the pumps and oil-rich autocrats prof-
it. 
That is why I have led nearly 90 of 
my House colleagues in calling on 
President Biden to lead a climate re-
start to reconciliation negotiations 
centering the cost-saving clean energy 
investments as the path forward to de-
liver tangible results to the American 
people. This is a code red moment, and 
it cannot wait any longer. 
SUPPORTING WOMEN WHO ARE SEXUALLY 
ABUSED 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, sex-
ual assault is common among female 
students 
of 
all 
ages, 
races, 
and 
ethnicities. On college campuses, one 
in five women in college experience a 
sexual assault. Studies show that stu-
dents are at the highest risk of sexual 
assault in the first few months of their 
first and second semesters in college. 
This is unacceptable. Every woman 
everywhere has the right to live free 
from abuse. This is why it was so im-
portant to reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act, and I am proud 
that we finally passed that reauthor-
ization into law in our omnibus pack-
age. 
But we also have to ensure that 
women who are at risk have trained, 
trusted professionals who they can 
reach out to when they are at risk. 
That is why I was pleased to introduce, 
and see included in the final package, 
my amendment to ensure that appro-
priate campus faculty, such as aca-
demic advisers or professionals who 
deal with students on a daily basis, are 
trained to recognize victims of sexual 
and domestic violence. We have to en-
sure that our campuses are equipped 
with the tools and knowledge to com-
bat violence against women. 
If you are sexually assaulted, your 
experience is valid. It is not your fault, 
and you are not alone. Please know 
there is a community of people ready 
and willing to believe you, trust you, 
and support you. 
TRADING IN INDIVIDUAL STOCKS BY 
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF AND MEMBERS 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, there 
is an iron rule of investing: unless you 
are Warren Buffet or have access to in-
sider information, you won’t make 
money trying to outsmart the market. 
Invest in mutual funds and index funds 
to build your wealth. 
And yet, according to a recent New 
York Times article, Members of Con-
gress are not only buying and selling a 
lot of individual stocks, but we consist-
ently outperform the market. 
I don’t see Warren Buffet here nor do 
I see a lot of people with long track 
records of successful stock picking be-
fore they came to Congress, but I do 
see a lot of people with access to a lot 
of inside information, who know when 
we are about to change our defense 
contracts or invest in domestic semi-
conductor capacity, update our anti-
trust laws, or buy vaccines, and have 
the ability to trade on that inside in-
formation. 
Our responsibilities as Members of 
Congress are a trust from the voters. 
Ethics matters. That is why I don’t 
personally own or trade individual 
stocks, and I encourage every Member 
of Congress to stop trading stocks im-
mediately. Even the appearance of im-
propriety by one Member cheapens us 
all. 
That is why I am a proud cosponsor 
of the Ban Conflicted Trading Act, 
which would bar Members of Congress 
and senior congressional staff from 
buying or selling individual stocks and 
other investments and from serving on 
any corporate boards while in office. 
We owe it to the American people to 
pass that bill and sign it into law.

AMERICA’S ENERGY CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address America’s energy 
crisis and the administration’s contin-
ued assault on American-made energy 
that has killed jobs, increased our de-
pendency on foreign oil, and most re-
cently jeopardized our national secu-
rity. 
Just 1 year ago, our country was 
comfortably meeting our energy needs, 
and we were a net exporter of energy 
for the first time in 50 years. However, 
under this administration’s leadership 
or lack thereof, we have dramatically 
increased our dependence on foreign 
oil, sent gas prices sky high, and in-
creased heating bills during the winter. 
Instead of turning to America’s own 
energy sector to meet our energy needs 
and continue to make us independent, 
this administration is asking countries 
like Iran and Venezuela to compensate 
for the ban on Russian imports and ig-
noring American energy producers. 
In doing so, the administration is 
prioritizing oil produced by dictators 
over American energy producers who 
support jobs and businesses here at 
home. 
I urge the administration to flip the 
switch and reduce our dependence on 
foreign energy by increasing produc-
tion of oil and gas at home. We can do 
this. 
MODERNIZING AND STREAMLINING DIAGNOSTIC 
TESTING 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to bring attention to legisla-
tion that I have been working on with 
the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. 
DEGETTE) called the VALID Act, a bi-
partisan, bicameral solution to mod-
ernize and streamline diagnostic test-
ing through establishing a risk-based 
framework for review and approval of 
laboratory-developed tests or in vitro 
diagnostic tests. 
Many of you might be thinking, why 
does this matter? Well, let me tell you. 
Right now in America, laboratory-de-
veloped tests are not regulated for clin-
ical or analytical accuracy. This is a 
problem. CMS and FDA have both told 
us that this is so. They do not regulate 
these tests. 
Every single day there is a new story 
of inaccuracy of these diagnostic tests 
that can be life changing and life alter-
ing with severe consequences. As a doc-
tor, it breaks my heart to hear of situ-
ations where, for example, a young 
woman falsely tests positive for a po-
tential risk for cancer, takes preven-
tive action to save her life potentially,

an irreversible action that might pre-
vent her from ever having more chil-
dren, only to find out that the test was 
falsely positive and inaccurate. 
A recent article in The New York 
Times outlined the inaccuracy of some 
prenatal diagnostic blood tests, which 
were very inaccurate. This may lead to 
potential life-changing medical deci-
sions based on these false results. It is 
absolutely devastating. 
If passed, the VALID Act would pro-
tect patients and save lives by ensuring 
Americans can rely on the test results 
they receive while also allowing lead-
ing-edge development and innovation 
to thrive in our hospitals and labora-
tories.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF KATHY J. SACKMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in memory of Kathy J. Sackman, a pio-
neer in the labor movement, as well as 
a registered nurse and founder of the 
United Nurses Association of Cali-
fornia/Union 
of 
Healthcare 
Profes-
sionals. 
I had the honor of serving with Kathy 
when I was her political director for a 
number of years, and she was a nurse’s 
nurse. She was a frontline nurse who 
worked in critical care units and saw 
that the adverse treatment of nurses 
led to worse outcomes for patients. She 
started in Pittsburgh and then moved 
to California, and she was a registered 
nurse in Fontana. 
I asked Kathy simply one day, why 
did you start the United Nurses Asso-
ciation 
of 
California/Union 
of 
Healthcare Professionals? And she said 
simply, I saw that the nurses were 
being treated very differently, very dif-
ferently than the doctors. We didn’t 
even have dental, and they did. She 
said, it seemed small then, but it was 
something big because it represented 
just the fact that nurses, people that 
work in healthcare, didn’t even get the 
proper benefits that they deserved. So 
they decided to organize. 
That 
organization 
now 
is 
32,000 
strong, representing not only reg-
istered nurses but also nurse midwives. 
It is something that she left a living 
legacy that will continue for years to 
come. 
One of the things that we tried to re-
mind people, she told me, is that the 
wins that we have achieved tend to be 
forgotten over the years; that the pay 
for nurses; that the staffing ratio for 
nurses; that the way nurses are viewed 
today has always been so. And she said 
that that was not always the case. And 
that is why they fought to organize, 
they fought for their patients. 
But she also understood that if you 
don’t treat the nurses well, then the 
patients are not treated well. If you 
have 10 patients for one nurse, well, 
there is no way that those patients can 
get the quality care that they deserve. 
So she led, as well as other nurses, for 
the fight for staffing ratios in Cali-
fornia that have improved the out-
comes for patients across not only 
southern California, where she started 
the Nurses Union, but throughout the 
entire State and the country. 
One of the things that she was always 
proud of is that she always put mem-
bers first, nurses first, the community 
first, the hospital first because she 
knew if the hospital did well, that the 
nurses would do well. If the nurses do 
well, patients do well. So this is some-
thing that was impressive. 
Quick story: She reorganized a hos-
pital, nurses at a particular hospital. 
And when we opened up the hospital’s 
books, they were flat broke. Every 
night a creditor would swipe their bank 
accounts, take all the money that was 
owed to them, and they would never 
have enough money to put into patient 
care or to keep them whole. 
So she made an agreement with the 
nurses; we are going to help save this 
hospital. She worked with the parent 
union of this union called AFSCME 
International, a Republican Member of 
Congress, a Democratic Senator, to get 
the bridge funding necessary to help 
that hospital stay afloat. It was a safe-
ty net hospital; and told them that 
once we get that hospital stabilized, 
their finances are better, and we can 
get your raise, then you will be pay 
more dues. At that point, they were 
only paying $5 in dues. That is unheard 
of. But that is because she knew that 
in the end you had to get that hospital 
to a place that was financially stable; 
that was stable for the patient; and was 
stable for the people that worked 
there. 
In the end, she helped save a hospital 
that was in a low-income community. 
It was a working-class community and 
the community that I grew up in, Riv-
erside, California. 
She will always have a lasting legacy 
as long as we continue to fight for pa-
tients, for nurses, and for our commu-
nities. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to also 
mention that she is survived by two 
sons, Monty and Michael, and an ex-
tended family.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today, in recognition of Women’s His-
tory Month, I rise to honor three in-
credible women from central Wash-
ington. 
Shannon Polson of the Methow Val-
ley became one of the first women 
combat pilots in the U.S. military. 
After graduating from the University 
of Alaska ROTC, she was commissioned 
as an Army aviator and was one of the 
first women to fly the Apache attack 
helicopter. She served two tours as an 
Apache platoon leader, and one as a 
company 
commander, 
deploying 
to 
three continents. 
Kathy Bryson of Richland is the Pa-
cific Northwest disaster response coor-
dinator 
for 
the 
United 
Methodist 
Church. Kathy has provided the overall 
leadership for recovery from fire disas-
ters in Okanogan and Whitman Coun-
ties over the last 2 years, as well as for 
the wildfire disasters in Oregon and 
northern California. 
Kayla Barron of Richland was not 
only a member of the first class of 
women commissioned into the sub-
marine community for the U.S. Navy 
as a submarine warfare officer, but is 
currently serving as mission specialist 
of the NASA SpaceX Crew-3 mission to 
the International Space Station. In 
fact, just yesterday morning, she suc-
cessfully completed a spacewalk. She 
has accomplished much since grad-
uating from Richland High, and you 
can bet that we are all rooting for her 
every step of the way. 
These women exemplify the very best 
of central Washington: Service to com-
munity, determination, integrity, and 
grit. They have paved the way for 
women in our communities and across 
the world. Their stories are an inspira-
tion for all of us in central Wash-
ington, and it is a privilege to honor 
them during Women’s History Month. 
CONGRATULATING JARED BALCOM 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to congratulate National 
Potato Council’s newly elected presi-
dent, 
and 
fellow 
central 
Washing-
tonian, Mr. Jared Balcom. 
Jared is the owner of a fourth-gen-
eration potato growing and fresh pack-
ing company, Balcom & Moe, based in 
Pasco, Washington, so he knows first-
hand the challenges our central Wash-
ington producers face and how to best 
address them. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with and getting to know Jared over 
the years and know that he is well- 
equipped to advocate for the potato 
farmers who provide so many jobs and 
boost our local economy. 
Congratulations, Jared, on this new 
role. I look forward to continuing to 
work together to advance our shared 
goals of modernizing water infrastruc-
ture, improving trade agreements, sup-
porting agricultural research, and fix-
ing our agricultural labor crisis. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF CLIFTON MALM 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor one of central 
Washington’s veterans, Clifton Malm of 
Omak. 
Clifton served our country honorably 
as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and 
risked his life to protect his fellow 
servicemembers. His courage earned 
him a Purple Heart which, unfortu-
nately, he never received until just 
now. While it may be just a small piece 
of metal, it represents what I believe is 
the gratitude of a truly thankful Na-
tion. 
Clifton, thank you for your service 
and for your continued dedication to

RECOGNIZING JEWISH FAMILY 
SERVICES 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize Jewish Fam-
ily Services and join them in cele-
brating their 150th anniversary. 
From their founding in 1872, Jewish 
Family Services has always adapted to 
meet the moment time and time again. 
They helped resettle Holocaust sur-
vivors in the wake of World War II, 
opened a group home for individuals 
with disabilities in the 1980s, and 
formed an employment services depart-
ment in 2021. 
In the last year alone, Jewish Family 
Services helped over 25,000 individuals 
stand strong against COVID–19 and 
even became a temporary Afghan ref-
ugee resettlement agency for Afghans 
looking to start new lives in the Den-
ver metro area. 
For 150 years, our community has 
been made a better and more inclusive 
place to live because of the thousands 
of volunteers who have pulled upon 
their faith to serve our community and 
improve the lives of others. 
I congratulate and thank Jewish 
Family Services for their service to 
our community and look forward to 
what the next 150 years will bring.

PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY’S 
MESSAGE TO RUSSIAN TROOPS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, during a Monday ad-
dress to the Ukrainian people, Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a di-
rect appeal to soldiers of Russia, ask-
ing: ‘‘. . . why should you die?’’ 
Zelensky said: ‘‘We hear what you 
really think about this senseless war 
. . .’’ Then telling those who surrender: 
‘‘. . . we will treat you the way people 
are supposed to be treated’’ and ‘‘. . . 
not how you are being treated in your 
army.’’ 
Today, Putin declared war on the 
Russian people. His call for self-cleans-
ing is a repeat of the murderous Stalin-
ists purges leading to Soviet Socialist 
nonpersons who disappeared. 
Today, I will be offering legislation 
for expedited refugee status to America 
for defecting members of the Duma, 
diplomatic personnel, and Russian Gov-
ernment officials. 
This reinforces the bipartisan legisla-
tion for Russian military defectors for 
expedited refugee status to America. 
The defectors who turn over equipment 
to Ukraine will receive up to $100,000. 
I also have a bill in Congress for a 
bust of President Zelenskyy to be 
placed in the U.S. Capitol. 
God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. 
Long 
live 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy. 
f 
HONORING GEORGE NETTELS 
(Mr. LATURNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of George Nettels. A Pittsburg, Kansas, 
native and U.S. Army veteran, George 
attended Pittsburg High School, grad-
uated from the University of Kansas, 
had a successful career in the private 
sector, and went on to serve as the 
chair of the Kansas Republican Party. 
At a time when many Americans in 
their fifties would start to slow down, 
George was just speeding up. George 
and his wife, Josie, lived a full life of 
travel and adventure and raised a beau-
tiful family. To top it all off, at the age 
of 84, George joined his grandson Jack 
in a 10,000-foot tandem jump. 
Beyond teaching me important les-
sons about being grateful for those 
that help you, George has personally 
inspired me and many others to live a 
life of service to others. That is what 
George did. Whether it was the commu-
nity of Pittsburg, southeast Kansas, 
the State of Kansas, or our great Na-
tion, George put the well-being of oth-
ers before himself. 
f 
INFLATION’S IMPACT ON SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, rising gas prices and sky-
rocketing inflation are having major 
impacts on small businesses. In Hico, 
Texas, Mark Chapman of the Chapman 
Cattle Company said it best: ‘‘We see 
smaller revenue and return on our 
products when the prices of gas in-
crease, and it may be the death of 
small businesses, ranchers, and farm-
ers, as we know it.’’ 
Chapman Cattle Company is one of 
the many small businesses that are 
struggling to keep up with record-high 
gas prices due to President Biden’s 
anti-energy agenda. 
Democrats continue to ignore Main 
Street’s plea to get gas prices down and 
inflation under control. Small busi-
nesses weathered tough economic con-
ditions throughout the pandemic only 
to be met with Biden’s Green New Deal 
agenda that threatens everybody in all 
communities forever. 
I will continue to fight for small 
businesses, work to get the government 
out of our lives, and let the free mar-
ket compete and do great things. 
In God we trust.

of Texas Permian Basin, then earning 
his doctorate in higher education from 
Baylor University. In 2007, Dr. Wil-
liams returned to the Permian Basin to 
serve as president of Odessa College. 
His impressive career has garnered 
local, State, and national attention. As 
both the chairman of the Texas Asso-
ciation of Community Colleges and as a 
member of the board of directors and 
the executive board of the American 
Association of Community Colleges, he 
continuously dedicates his time for the 
advocacy of community colleges and 
underrepresented communities. 
Thanks to Dr. Williams’ stewardship, 
Odessa College has become one of the 
most impactful educational institu-
tions in the Nation. Not only did his 
leadership earn Odessa College na-
tional recognition as a top-ranked 
community college, but his tenure as 
president saw enrollment increase by 
35 percent and the number of degrees 
awarded by an incredible 197 percent. 
I thank my colleague from Illinois 
for also representing the achievements 
of Dr. Williams. He is a fierce advocate 
of community colleges. I speak for the 
entire community in sincerely thank-
ing Dr. Williams for his commitment 
to the Permian Basin and to higher 
education.

ENDING MASK MANDATES ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to demand a vote on H.J. 
Res. 72, a Congressional Review Act 
resolution that would end the CDC’s 
mask mandate for airlines, trains, 
buses, and other public transportation 
hubs. 
Tuesday night, the Senate voted in a 
rare bipartisan manner to end these 
mandates in what even CNN called a 
‘‘bipartisan rebuke of Biden adminis-
tration policy.’’ 
States and cities, big and small, 
across the country have ended or are in 
the process of ending their mask man-
dates at schools, basketball games, and 
even crowded restaurants. 
Thousands of fans will pack arenas in 
the coming days to cheer on their 
teams during March Madness. At these 
games, they rightly won’t be required 
to wear a mask. But as soon as they 
step onto a plane, a bus, a train, or 
even a metro, unelected bureaucrats, 
at the direction of President Biden, 
have decreed that masks must be put 
on and must be worn. 
It is past time for this unscientific 
mask mandate to end. I am calling on 
Speaker PELOSI to hold a vote on re-
pealing this mask mandate. Americans 
want their lives back, and it is time to 
vote. 
f 
FOCUS ON AMERICA FIRST 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
House to discuss why we need to focus 
on our country first. We are seeing rap-
idly rising inflation. It is completely 
out of control. 
While here in Congress and in the 
Washington bubble, which is discon-
nected with the rest of America, all we 
are hearing is potential war with Rus-
sia over the country of Ukraine. 
Ukraine is not a NATO member ally, 
and President Biden had told them 
that we would be only standing with 
our NATO member allies. 
All we are hearing on the news is 
Ukraine. Yet, here in America, what 
real Americans care about are gas 
prices they can’t afford, inflation that 
goes up and up to where grocery bills 
are unaffordable, and they are very 
concerned about our out-of-control, 
open border. 
Crime is out of control, yet Wash-
ington is completely disconnected and 
seems to care more about sending our 
sons and daughters to a potential war 
where they do not belong. 
I urge my colleagues here in Con-
gress, instead of working on a future 
COVID bill, spending billions of dollars 
on COVID that doesn’t exist, let’s care 
about our border and let’s care about 
working to have energy independence 
to lower gas prices for Americans. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THE 
BELLARMINE KNIGHTS 
(Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the best college basket-
ball team not in a bracket this week-
end. The Bellarmine Knights did what 
no team has done before, winning a Di-
vision I championship just 2 years re-
moved from Division II, a title that 
should come with a big dance invita-
tion. 
Instead, this Cinderella story was cut 
short by an NCAA which, as it often 
does, played wicked stepmother, up-
holding a bizarre rule preventing teams 
elevating too quickly from Division II 
to championship contender. 
Who they think they are serving, I 
don’t know, but they cannot take away 
the Knights’ extraordinary achieve-
ments or the pride they brought their 
school and hometown. They entered 
the season as afterthoughts and fin-
ished as ASUN champions and just the 
tenth team since 2007 to win 20 games 
against a top-5 schedule. 
This incredible feat for the players is 
a triumph for Coach Scotty Davenport, 
who has won championships in Louis-
ville for 35 years at every level and 
seems like he could for 35 more. 
Scotty noted that each season ends 
with just two teams left standing, the 
NCAA and NIT champs. This year, the 
season ends with three. Please join me 
in honoring the Bellarmine Knights, 
the first NCAA team to finish this bas-
ketball season as champions.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 963. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 963, the Forced 
Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, or 
the FAIR Act, is critical legislation 
that would restore access to justice for 
millions of Americans who are cur-
rently locked out of the court system 
and are forced to settle their disputes 
against companies in a private system 
of arbitration that is often skewed in 
the company’s favor over the indi-
vidual. 
Private arbitration has been trans-
formed, by 40 years of reckless Su-
preme Court decisions, from a vol-
untary forum for companies to resolve 
commercial disputes into a legal night-
mare for millions of consumers, em-
ployees, and others who are forced into 
arbitration and are unable to enforce 
certain fundamental rights in court. 
By 
burying 
a 
forced 
arbitration 
clause deep in the fine print of take-it- 
or-leave-it consumer and employment 
contracts, companies can evade the 
court system, where plaintiffs have far 
greater legal protections, and hide 
wrongdoing behind a one-sided process 
that is tilted in their favor. 
For example, arbitration generally 
limits discovery; does not adhere to the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; can 
prohibit class actions, which it almost 
always does; and deny the right of ap-
peal. Worse yet, arbitration allows the 
proceedings, and often even the results, 
to stay secret, thereby permitting com-
panies to avoid public scrutiny of po-
tential misconduct. 
For millions of workers and con-
sumers, the precondition, whether they 
know it or not, of obtaining a basic 
service or product, such as a bank ac-
count, a cell phone, a credit card, or 
even a job, is that they must sign a 
nonnegotiable contract that includes a 
provision requiring all disputes to be 
resolved in private arbitration. 
These take-it-or-leave-it contracts, 
which were once clearly disfavored 
under the law, now seem to have been 
blessed by the Supreme Court as stand-
ard operating procedure in the cor-
porate world. 
That means for millions of people, 
the ability to enforce consumer, labor, 
antitrust, and civil rights laws are sub-
ject to the whims of a private arbi-
trator, often selected by the companies 
themselves. 
These private arbitrators are not re-
quired to provide plaintiffs any of the 
fundamental protections guaranteed in 
the courts, and their further employ-
ment can depend on building a good 
reputation with the companies that 
hire them. Unsurprisingly, arbitration 
has become a virtual get-out-of-jail- 
free card many companies use to cir-
cumvent the basic rights of consumers 
and workers. 
The FAIR Act reverses this disas-
trous trend by prohibiting the enforce-
ment of forced arbitration clauses in 
consumer, labor, antitrust, and civil 
rights disputes. 
Importantly, this legislation does not 
preclude both parties from agreeing to 
arbitrate a claim after a dispute arises. 
It does, however, protect unsuspecting 
consumers and employees from being 
forced to give up their right to seek 
justice in court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3790 
March 17, 2022 
Last month, Congress came together 
in a bipartisan fashion to prohibit 
forced arbitration clauses in suits con-
cerning sexual harassment and sexual 
assault. Watching that legislation be 
signed into law was a proud moment 
for many of us in this Chamber. This 
bill simply extends the same basic fair-
ness in that bill to other workers and 
consumers. 
That bipartisan bill, which gathered, 
as I recall, about 130 Republican votes, 
is exactly the same as this bill, only 
limited in its application. 
Every argument for that bill is an ar-
gument for this bill. This bill simply 
extends the same basic fairness in that 
bill, as I said, to other workers and 
consumers. 
I thank the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. JOHNSON) for his leadership on this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this vital legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 963. There 
is nothing fair about the FAIR Act. 
The bill would undermine Americans’ 
freedom to contract; burden the judi-
cial system, both Federal and in all 
States in the country; and restrict ac-
cess to justice. 
This bill would ban arbitration agree-
ments across nearly all contracts. It 
outlaws arbitration agreements in em-
ployment disputes, consumer disputes, 
antitrust disputes, and civil rights dis-
putes. It outlaws arbitration agree-
ments with respect to not only big, 
huge corporations but the most humble 
businesses and parties in the country, 
those that I served in my law practice. 
Democrats propose that arbitration 
is bad for Americans, but it has been a 
fixture of our legal landscape for al-
most 100 years. They claim that arbi-
tration is forced. Both of their claims 
are wrong. 
Arbitration has many benefits. It is 
more efficient and faster than going to 
court. The rules are not nearly as ar-
cane. Injured parties get their relief 
sooner, and they spend less money 
along the way. 
Plaintiffs in employment and con-
sumer disputes, according to studies, 
actually win more in arbitration than 
they do in court. They get more money 
in arbitration. They win more often in 
arbitration. 
Democrats know that arbitration has 
plenty of benefits. How do you know 
this? Because in this very bill, Demo-
crats have carved out their union 
friends from the mandates of this bill. 
In other words, if the bill becomes 
law, powerful unions, and no one else, 
can still use these valuable agreements 
vis-a-vis individuals. 
This carve-out also tells us that 
Democrats know there is no such thing 
as forced arbitration. Agreements that 
are truly forced are already illegal 
under existing law in every State in 
the country. 
People are no more forced to agree to 
an arbitration provision than they are 
to agree to any other provision of a 
contract. The bill, instead, bans pri-
vate parties from knowingly and will-
ingly agreeing on a process to resolve 
future disputes. It tells Americans, no 
matter how informed or sophisticated 
they may be, that they can’t be trusted 
to manage their own relationships by 
agreeing in advance to the means of 
resolution to be used in the event of a 
dispute. 
Our Democrat colleagues seem to be-
lieve that Americans can’t be trusted 
to think for themselves. Big Govern-
ment needs to tell them what to do. 
Their freedom to contract should be re-
stricted by the wisdom from Wash-
ington. 
Democrats argue that this bill is no 
big deal because parties can still decide 
to use arbitration after a dispute 
arises, but that never happens in prac-
tice for much the same reason that 
many disputes go to court and are re-
solved outside of a jury. About 1 to 2 
percent actually go all the way. 
The decision to get into a lawsuit is 
not always purely rational, taken from 
all points of view, and is often affected 
by tempers that are different once the 
dispute has arisen than when the par-
ties are considering a position of cool 
judgment in advance. 
Their incentives change after a dis-
pute has arisen, and people will pick a 
strategy to resolve that dispute at that 
time. They won’t necessarily be look-
ing for a process, then, that is good for 
both parties for many reasons. 
When you are immersed in a dispute, 
there is also a greater chance that a 
lawyer that you may have retained 
would have an incentive to direct you 
in the direction of litigation rather 
than arbitration, and those incentives 
certainly won’t necessarily be con-
sistent with a faster and cheaper alter-
native. 
Rather than helping the little guy 
stand up to big companies, this bill 
would take the option to arbitrate off 
the table for everybody and put more 
money in the pockets of trial lawyers, 
most especially plaintiffs’ class action 
trial lawyers. 
The bill would force more people into 
court. They will pay more and possibly 
recover less. But it would also force 
some people out of the justice system 
altogether. 
Some people will be unable to pay for 
an expensive lawsuit, or they may have 
a claim so small that it is only prac-
ticable for them to bring it themselves, 
which arbitration facilitates. 
Let’s be clear, too. The surge in new 
lawsuits hurts employment. It hurts 
businesses and keeps them from being 
able to afford to hire more people. It 
will raise their costs at the worst pos-
sible time, when they are already deal-
ing with supply chain problems and 
record inflation caused by failed Demo-
crat policies, and not only by prohib-
iting the use of arbitration going for-
ward but by retroactively eliminating 
it, rendering it null and void in mil-
lions of contracts already outstanding 
right now, at this point in the life of 
our Nation, when we have 8 percent in-
flation, another constraint on the sup-
ply chain imposed by Democrat poli-
cies. 
Everyone should be sounding the 
alarm on this blatant overreach. At the 
end of the day, this bill curries favor 
with the plaintiffs’ bar and union 
bosses, and it does so at the expense of 
hardworking 
Americans 
and 
small 
businesses, especially. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose H.R. 963, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I want to correct something Mr. 
BISHOP said. This bill does not ban ar-
bitration. It bans forced arbitration. It 
bans the practice or the enforceability 
of the practice of having a provision in 
a contract that you sign to buy any-
thing 
or 
an 
employment 
contract 
where you are forced, that is there and 
that if you try to change it, they won’t 
sell you the car, they won’t sell you 
the cell phone, they won’t hire you, so 
you have no choice, and that forced ar-
bitration removes the constitutional 
right to a trial by jury. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this 
morning I went to a breakfast where I 
heard the thoughts of Miss Sheila Bair. 
Miss Bair is a Republican. She de-
scribes herself as a Midwest Republican 
who worked on Senator Dole’s staff for 
8 years. She is a former assistant sec-
retary of the Treasury and a former 
head of the FDIC under Republican 
Presidents. 
She said specifically the problems 
with inflation in this country are 
worldwide. They are the supply chain, 
which is worldwide, caused by the pan-
demic in China and other problems. 
They are worldwide. So any more of 
this rhetoric about Biden and his prob-
lems with the supply chain, it is not 
Biden; it is a worldwide problem. 
The same thing for the price of oil. 
Yesterday, in Judiciary Committee we 
heard someone say it is Biden’s fault 
that the price of oil has gone up. The 
price of oil is a worldwide market. 
President Biden’s actions do not affect 
the worldwide market. It is supply and 
demand. We need to not hear these ca-
nards. 
And the same for this bill. This is, as 
Mr. NADLER said, forced arbitration. 
Mr. JOHNSON has been working on this 
for years, and I compliment him on his 
work and his success. This gives con-
sumers a chance to get their cases 
heard and to get a rightful judgment, 
not be forced to take an arbitration 
that is almost always entirely pro- 
business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3791 
March 17, 2022 
This is the difference between Repub-
licans and Democrats. Democrats look 
out for people, people who have had in-
justice done to them and look for a 
way to correct it and give them equity. 
Republicans look to business, who 
caused the harm, and try to defend 
them and keep their pockets full. 
I support the bill. All American con-
sumers would support the bill. I urge 
its passage. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The distinguished chairman of the 
committee offered to correct me by 
saying that the bill only prohibits 
forced arbitration, said that was a cor-
rection, as if I misspoke as to facts. 
Let me read from the language of the 
bill: ‘‘Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of this title, no predispute arbitra-
tion agreement or predispute joint-ac-
tion waiver shall be valid or enforce-
able with respect to an employment 
dispute, consumer dispute, antitrust 
dispute, or civil rights dispute.’’ 
The word ‘‘forced’’ was not in that 
language, Madam Speaker. It prohibits 
all predispute arbitration agreements 
and post-joint action waivers. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my gracious colleague for yielding, 
though we do not hold the same posi-
tion on this piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, when our fellow 
Americans get a cell phone contract, 
when they get cable, when they get 
internet, they are subject to forced ar-
bitration. Virtually every single Amer-
ican lives under a forced arbitration 
provision today, and most do not know 
it. 
Do we really think that people have 
the ability to go negotiate against 
AT&T or Comcast or in many cases big 
businesses that employ a great deal of 
Americans? Of course, they don’t. 
And so what that means is that we 
have a two-tier system of dispute reso-
lution. Regular folks get to show up at 
Article III courts the taxpayers fund to 
resolve their disputes, and meanwhile 
oftentimes big business gets a con-
cierge lane to be able to resolve mat-
ters in their favor and oftentimes to 
preclude the resolution of a matter at 
all. 
Think about instances of wage theft 
where big businesses can take just a 
little bit of money and not pay their 
employees. Well, an individual em-
ployee would have a very hard time 
getting a lawyer and making a case on 
that, and so they need the class action 
tool to be able to get redress for their 
grievances. The forced arbitration pro-
visions that impair so many of our fel-
low Americans limit that class action 
tool, and then people end up getting 
really screwed in the process. 
I support the legislation. I am proud 
to be the Republican lead, and it is my 
belief that if Article III courts funded 
by the taxpayers are good enough for 
the rest of us, they ought to be good 
enough for big business. I thank the 
gentleman for his indulgence. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentleman from Florida, 
and as I suggested earlier, if the bill 
were a matter only of big businesses, it 
would be a very different bill, but just 
as there is no limitation to forced arbi-
tration agreements in the language of 
the bill, there is no limitation to arbi-
tration agreements entered into be-
tween little guys and big companies. 
The very first appeal I ever took in a 
30-year law practice in 1992 was in a 
case called Bennish v. North Carolina 
Dance Theater, in which I represented 
a fledgling, very-hard-pressed economi-
cally arts group in my hometown that 
had an employment dispute with a 
dancer who wanted to litigate. They 
had an arbitration agreement. It would 
have destroyed that organization fi-
nancially to have to engage in ex-
tended and expensive litigation. This 
bill would have made the enforcement 
of that arbitration agreement unlaw-
ful, and it has nothing to do with big 
business. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a member 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 963, the 
FAIR Act, which prohibits the enforce-
ment of forced arbitration clauses in 
consumer, employment, civil rights, 
and antitrust disputes. 
Buried deep within the fine print of 
almost every contract consumers sign 
are clauses that deprive hardworking 
Americans and small businesses of 
their day in court when they attempt 
to hold corporations accountable for 
breaking the law. 
We heard from lots of small busi-
nesses in support of this bill. No one 
claimed that they were required to 
have forced arbitration in order to re-
main successful. Forced arbitration 
protects systemic wrongdoing. Every-
one is always allowed to have arbitra-
tion if they want to voluntarily once a 
dispute arises. 
This forces people to give up their 
right to have their claims heard, and 
most Americans don’t even know they 
have given up that right because they 
are forced to sign contracts, where in 
the fine print is a provision where you 
are waiving that right. When you get a 
phone, when you get cable, when you 
have internet service. This outrageous 
practice, as my colleague from Florida 
just described, is nothing short of a 
corporate takeover of our Nation’s sys-
tem of justice, and it affects almost 
every single American. 
This private arbitration that is very 
expensive, that lasts a very long time 
also lacks the procedural safeguards of 
our justice system. It is not subject to 
oversight, it doesn’t have a judge, 
doesn’t have a jury, it is not bound by 
laws even passed by Congress or the 
States in which it occurs, but it has be-
come a requirement of everyday life for 
tens of millions of consumers and 
workers who have to surrender their 
rights to hold wrongdoers accountable. 
These provisions require people to 
give up the right to have their claims 
heard in a court of law and to have 
that remedy that will prevent the 
wrongdoer from continuing. 
Think about someone bringing a fam-
ily member or loved one into a nursing 
home who doesn’t have the opportunity 
to negotiate taking out that provision 
because someone they love is in des-
perate need of care. 
I will give you a real example: Some-
one who is defending our country; the 
case of Lieutenant Commander Kevin 
Ziober, who testified in support of the 
FAIR Act in the last Congress. He 
served in the U.S. Navy Reserves since 
2008. He was activated multiple times 
to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
On the last day of his employment, 
they had a party for him. They had a 
cake in the shape of a flag; they cele-
brated him; and moments later he was 
fired. When he said to his employer, 
‘‘You can’t fire me, there is a Federal 
statute that protects me,’’ they said, 
‘‘Sorry for you, you agreed to forced 
arbitration. You waived away your 
rights in your employment contract.’’ 
And in the fine print, sure enough, 
there it was. 
He testified at the hearing in 2019 
that his case was in arbitration 7 years 
later. Nothing fast about that. And 
sadly, he said, ‘‘This happens every day 
across America, not only to service-
members and veterans whose rights are 
violated, but also to working people 
and consumers of all backgrounds.’’ 
The FAIR Act will ensure that what 
happened to Lieutenant Ziober and 
what happens to millions of other hard-
working 
Americans 
never 
happens 
again. Let’s restore justice to our jus-
tice system by getting rid of these per-
nicious, horrible, unfair provisions. 
As I conclude, I thank Congressman 
JOHNSON for his extraordinary leader-
ship. He has been fighting to try to free 
the hardworking Americans and con-
sumers and people who fight for our 
country from the bondage of forced ar-
bitration clauses, and finally we can do 
that today. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ Vote for the 
FAIR Act. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
We still haven’t heard an explanation 
for why this legislation deems it appro-
priate to eliminate arbitration for par-
ties of all sizes. We keep hearing about 
the little guy versus the massive cor-
poration. 
Even in that circumstance, of course, 
what we may be talking about is like 
the case from 2011, AT&T Mobility v. 
Concepcion, where the issue was people 
in California had bought cell phones, 
they had been offered a free cell phone, 
but it wasn’t made clear that they 
would have to pay the sales tax. So

there was a $5 claim per purchaser, and 
wealthy plaintiffs’ class-action lawyers 
wanted to bring a big lawsuit. With 
tens of thousands of them, they might 
get a $5 coupon, but the lawyers would 
buy a new jet. 
That may be in some circumstances, 
even the dispute with the big guy. But 
leave that aside. We still don’t hear 
any explanation for why you are wip-
ing out arbitration as a means that 
parties choose, even if they are on 
equal bargaining power. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Happy St. Patrick’s 
Day, Madam Speaker. I just want to 
gently 
correct 
my 
colleague 
from 
North Carolina when he cited 8 percent 
inflation. On an annualized basis, we 
are seeing it being measured at 10 per-
cent here. I can understand the Rep-
resentative from Tennessee’s sensi-
tivity toward Bidenflation. 
Today, we are here because the 
Democrats want to pass legislation 
that insults the intelligence of Ameri-
cans. According to my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, the only 
people sophisticated enough to enter 
into 
arbitration 
agreements 
are 
unions, so they have exempted them 
from this bill. Convenient. 
This legislation prohibits predispute 
arbitration agreements, which are a 
fair, efficient, and effective way for 
consumers, workers, and businesses to 
settle disputes without costly and 
time-consuming litigation that mainly 
benefits the trial bar. This bill will also 
deprive Americans of an effective legal 
option, while costing them more time 
and money. 
Predispute 
arbitration 
agreements 
exist in many employment and con-
sumer contracts today and are enforced 
like any other kind of contract. Arbi-
tration is generally fair, often leads to 
better outcomes for workers, and does 
not keep claimants from simulta-
neously alerting the world to bad ac-
tors. Those agreements create a win- 
win situation for parties to contract in 
advance on a process for resolving fu-
ture disputes. 
Courts, accordingly, uphold and en-
force lawful agreements to arbitrate 
when disputes arise between parties, an 
approach consistent with the funda-
mental principle that arbitration is a 
matter of contract. This policy of indi-
viduals being free to contract has argu-
ably long been a feature of American 
law. Existing law also permits courts 
to invalidate agreements under gen-
erally applicable contract defenses, 
such as fraud or duress. 
Some will argue that arbitration re-
quires confidentiality. This is not true. 
The parties to the agreement always 
have a right to disclose details of the 
proceeding unless they have a separate 
confidentiality agreement. Nor does 
current law typically preclude a party 
from disclosing information obtained 
in the arbitration process or any re-
sulting award. Arbitration is usually 
less expensive and faster than litiga-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS of Georgia). The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin. 
Mr. TIFFANY. It normally mini-
mizes hostility, is less disruptive of on-
going and future business dealings, and 
is often more flexible. This legislation 
does not favor the American consumer. 
The only ones favored are the unions 
and the trial bar. This is not right for 
Americans, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this un-fair act. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHN-
SON), a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee and a sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for the 
time today to speak on the FAIR Act, 
and I ask my fellow colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
My colleagues and I on the other side 
of the aisle will disagree on much, but 
on one thing we can all agree, and that 
is the Constitution of the United 
States of America is a great document. 
At the beginning of that document is 
the preamble, and the first 17 words of 
the preamble read as follows: ‘‘We the 
people of the United States, in order to 
form a more perfect Union, establish 
justice,’’ and then it goes on. But you 
can see at the very top, the ideal of the 
Founders was to establish justice in 
this country. 
b 1245 
So they went about the Constitution 
by giving power to the legislative 
branch in Article I, to the executive 
branch in Article Number II, and to the 
judicial branch, the Court system, to 
establish justice in Article III. 
And then, in the Bill of Rights, the 
first 10 amendments to the Constitu-
tion where the Bill of Rights for we, 
the people, gave us our individual 
rights, with the exception of Amend-
ment 10, which gives the States all 
powers not reserved to the Federal 
Government. 
So the Bill of Rights, in the Seventh 
Amendment to the Constitution, it 
guarantees the right to a jury trial, a 
trial by a jury of one’s peers for any 
civil case where the amount in con-
troversy exceeds $20 or more. That is 
still the law in this country. That is 
our Constitution. 
But the Supreme Court has seen fit 
to erode our freedoms insofar as a right 
to a jury trial by allowing corpora-
tions, employers, to take away that 
right from people. That is forced arbi-
tration. 
Gretchen Carlson, with FOX News, 
when she came forward with her claims 
that she was fired because she resisted 
the demands of Roger Ailes to have sex 
with him, and she filed a civil rights 
action, she was met with the bar of a 
forced arbitration clause in the em-
ployment agreement that she signed. 
I was so happy, Madam Speaker, to 
attend a bill signing ceremony a couple 
of weeks ago at the White House where 
my colleague, CHERI BUSTOS’ legisla-
tion, the Ending Forced Arbitration of 
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act was signed into law. 
We need to go further. We just heard, 
within the last couple of weeks, of 
former coach Brian Flores of the 
Miami Dolphins, who filed a lawsuit 
against the Miami Dolphins and a cou-
ple of other clubs, as well as the NFL, 
alleging that he had been discrimi-
nated against racially. He had been de-
nied hiring opportunities and retention 
and compensation. He filed a com-
plaint. 
He is met by the NFL with an arbi-
tration clause. If it is good enough for 
sexual assault and sexual harassment 
cases, 
constitutional 
rights, 
those 
rights, that same ability needs to 
enure to those who have been aggrieved 
by racial discrimination and other 
types 
of 
discrimination. 
And 
con-
sumers need to be allowed to assert 
their Seventh Amendment right when 
it comes to a dispute with a shop owner 
or shopkeeper. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. And so, 
what we have seen with the U.S. Su-
preme Court is they have allowed cor-
porations to have rights under our Con-
stitution. Nowhere in it is there a sec-
tion for corporations. 
Let’s restore freedom to the people of 
this country as guaranteed by the Bill 
of Rights under the Constitution that 
we all live under. It is a constitutional 
right that, when there is a dispute, a 
party should be able to take that dis-
pute to court and have a jury trial, and 
no forced contract should deprive that 
person of that constitutional right. 
That is what the FAIR Act will do. It 
will render unenforceable, after the act 
is signed into law, unenforceable, any 
pre-dispute forced arbitration clauses 
in consumer agreements and in em-
ployment agreements, and also in civil 
rights cases, causes of action and also 
antitrust actions. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The distinguished gentleman from 
Georgia suggests that this bill is about 
whether or not we are preserving the 
right to jury trial in the Constitution. 
But I submit, that is not really what is 
at stake. 
The question is whether you resolve 
a dispute through arbitration or you go 
to the court system. If you go to the 
court system, there are innumerable 
paths within the court system that 
lead to not having your case decided by 
a jury. 
In fact, only about 1 to 2 percent of 
cases end up proceeding to a deter-
mination by a jury. That means 99 or 98

out of 100 cases do not. They might be 
dismissed on a motion for summary 
judgment. They might be dismissed for 
failure to state a claim. There may be 
settlement processes that come to fru-
ition during the course of the case. 
But it is almost never true—think 
about that—that a case in court goes 
to a jury. So this notion that this bill, 
by eliminating the choice of arbitra-
tion, somehow preserves everybody’s 
jury trial magically is a false choice. 
And more to that point, the gen-
tleman from Georgia, and also the 
chairman, in the inception, noted that 
we have just had a bill signing of a bill 
that excepts from enforceable arbitra-
tion agreements the category of sexual 
assault, sexual harassment. The major-
ity of Republicans supported that. 
The majority of Republicans will not 
support this bill because it represents 
the throwing out of the entire mecha-
nism of arbitration, which has been, as 
I indicated, a feature of the legal land-
scape used with great utility and uti-
lized throughout the last hundred 
years almost, since 1925. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Oregon 
(Mr. 
BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I move 
to recommit H.R. 936 and have my 
amendment that strikes the retro-
activity provision of this bill included 
in the RECORD. 
It is wrong, clearly not right, for 
Congress to step in and retroactively 
invalidate parts of millions of existing 
contracts. The parties to those con-
tracts, in good faith, relied on those 
parts of their contracts when they 
struck their bargain. But if this bill be-
comes law, it will rewrite millions of 
existing contracts, which will lead to 
waves of new litigation. 
This litigation will place new costs 
on businesses, consumers, and employ-
ees, who will be forced to pay more for 
lawyers, hundreds of dollars per hour 
and may get stuck for years in long 
court battles instead of having avail-
able the solution of arbitration. 
Applying new laws retroactively un-
dermines the rule of law and upends 
the certainty that parties are trying to 
create when they negotiate and enter 
into a contract. 
My motion would make this bill 
apply only to agreements entered into 
after this bill goes into effect. I offered 
this amendment at the markup in the 
Judiciary Committee, but the Demo-
crats there rejected it. 
I offered this amendment to the 
Rules Committee, but the Democrats 
there chose not to make it in order. 
I offer this amendment for a third 
time here on the floor of this House be-
cause this matter is critically impor-
tant. Retroactively voiding millions 
upon millions of existing contracts is 
truly bad policy. 
By making this bill apply only to fu-
ture contracts, we can avoid the inher-
ent unfairness of having Congress di-
rectly interfere in millions upon mil-
lions of existing agreements. I urge my 
colleagues to support my motion to re-
commit. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt this mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on the Judiciary to con-
sider again my amendment to H.R. 963 
to ensure that the Democrats’ attempt 
to eviscerate arbitration will not apply 
retroactively to the millions upon mil-
lions of contractual agreements al-
ready in place. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of this 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just want to point out that this bill 
does not ban arbitration. If two parties 
have a dispute and prefer arbitration to 
going to court, they can have arbitra-
tion. This bill bans forced arbitration, 
meaning arbitration that is entered 
into contracts that people have no abil-
ity to change. That is why it says pre- 
dispute 
arbitration 
agreements 
are 
struck by this bill, not post-dispute ar-
bitration agreements. 
So this bill does not eliminate arbi-
tration agreements if they want to. It 
does 
eliminate 
forced 
arbitration 
agreements that the party, usually the 
employee or the consumer had no 
knowledge of probably and no ability 
to say no to. We used to call them con-
tracts of adhesion, but we don’t do that 
anymore. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), a member of the Judici-
ary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my friends and colleagues, 
Chairman JOHNSON and Chairman NAD-
LER, for this long overdue legislation 
that we voted on last year; and, as 
well, to acknowledge the forced arbi-
tration legislation that was signed by 
the White House dealing with sexual 
assault. 
Now we have come full circle, so let 
me try to reinforce, because our friends 
on the other side of the aisle—and I 
call them friends—not only have it 
wrong, they have it upside down. It is 
completely misconstrued as to what 
this legislation does. 
And if you go out on the street cor-
ner and talk to any American they will 
say, of course I want the FAIR Act, be-
cause forced arbitration says to them 
that, in essence, you are obligated, you 
are indentured to the contract that 
you signed to get a job, to buy a phone, 
to get that big TV, and that you are 
not able to pursue your due process 
rights. 
Now, this is a constitutional issue. 
The Fifth Amendment completely indi-
cates that you cannot be deprived of 
life, liberty, or property without due 
process of law, however you choose 
your due process of law. 
We go on to the 14th Amendment; of 
course, part of the historic 13th, 14th 
and 15th Amendments, and it indicates 
that no State shall make or enforce 
any law which shall abridge the privi-
leges or immunities of citizens of the 
United States under this Constitution, 
which includes the right to a trial by 
jury, nor shall any State deprive any 
person of life, liberty, or property with-
out due process again; and that you 
would guarantee equal process and jus-
tice under the law. 
So let me factually say, though the 
signing of any contract or document is 
voluntary, often large corporations 
make it impossible to use their product 
or be employed without agreeing to a 
contract with a forced arbitration, 
making signing of the contract or doc-
ument anything but voluntary; and 
clearly, it has constitutional implica-
tions. 
Something that should alarm all 
American consumers is that according 
to a study commissioned by University 
of California Davis Law Review, 81 
companies in the Fortune 100, includ-
ing subsidiaries or relating affiliates, 
have used arbitration agreements in 
connection with consumer transaction. 
Now let me be very clear. When you 
have a dispute, we are perfectly happy 
for you, as the individual, part of the 
contract, to say to the corporation, I 
don’t care about my rights. I am going 
to throw myself on the mercy of arbi-
tration. And in doing so, you may sub-
ject yourself to a limited decision, as 
Brian Flores was finding out. 
Madam Speaker, let me tell you that 
American economic supremacy does 
not stem from the contributions of 
modern-day 
oligarchs, 
billionaires, 
CEOs, or the wealthy. It comes from 
the middle class. It comes from those 
60 million workers and countless others 
who put in an honest 8-hour day, five 
times a week, in the simple pursuit of 
trying to feed their families and take 
care of their communities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his gen-
erosity. 
I oppose the upcoming amendment 
that talks about not excluding unions. 
Unions have agreements between indi-
viduals. 
Unions 
have 
the 
power, 
through their persons they represent, 
to vote yea or nay for that contract. So 
if they vote yea or nay on that con-
tract, their eyes open on the arbitra-
tion, it is the union that will be pro-
tecting that individual. They will not 
be in that process alone. 
In the instance of an individual and 
the contracts that are signed, they will 
be alone. But they will not be alone if 
the FAIR Act is passed and the Con-
stitution is upheld. That is why I sup-
port enthusiastically the FAIR Act and 
oppose the amendment to be forth-
coming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3794 
March 17, 2022 
Pass the FAIR Act because justice 
and the Constitution requires it. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 963, ‘‘The FAIR Act’’ which prohibits a 
predispute arbitration agreement from being 
valid or enforceable in an employment, con-
sumer, antitrust, or civil rights dispute. 
Action on this legislation is long overdue 
considering the long history of the problems 
caused by forced arbitration. The FAIR Act 
was passed by the House in the 116th Con-
gress, so I hope we can pass it again now 
and that the Senate will do the same this time 
so we can finally resolve this problem. 
Forced arbitration is typically due to a 
clause in a contract that takes away employ-
ees’ and consumers’ rights to pursue litigation 
in the case their legal rights are violated. 60 
million American employees and myriad con-
sumers are unfairly, and usually unknowingly, 
subjected to its limitation of their legal rights. 
Though the signing of any contract or docu-
ment is voluntary, often large corporations 
make it impossible to use their product or be 
employed without agreeing to a contract with 
a forced arbitration clause, making signing of 
the contract or document anything but vol-
untary. 
Something that should alarm all American 
consumers is that, according to a study com-
missioned by the University of California Davis 
Law Review, 81 companies in the Fortune 
100, including subsidiaries or related affiliates, 
have used arbitration agreements in connec-
tion with consumer transactions. 
The study also found that possibly two- 
thirds of American households are covered by 
consumer based forced arbitration agree-
ments. 
This means nearly 86 million American 
households have their Constitutional right of 
access to the judicial system restricted. 
For American employees, the numbers are 
also staggering. Similarly, 60 million American 
employees are subject to forced arbitration 
agreements of which they are often unaware 
until a dispute arises for which they seek judi-
cial redress. 
The extensive reach of arbitration clauses is 
only increasing, with the Economic Policy In-
stitute estimating 80 percent of private sector 
nonunion workers being subject to forced arbi-
tration clauses by 2024. 
Madam Speaker, American economic su-
premacy does not stem from the contributions 
of modern-day oligarchs, billionaires, CEOs, or 
the wealthy; it comes from the middle class. It 
comes from those 60 million workers and 
countless others who put in an honest 8-hour 
day 5 times a week in the simple pursuit of 
trying to feed their families and take care of 
their communities. 
The fact that so many of these hard-working 
Americans are having their legal rights taken 
away without them knowing it is morally rep-
rehensible and must be put to an end. The 
FAIR Act remedies that 1 problem. 
In addition to being sound policy, the FAIR 
Act promotes racial equity in our rapidly diver-
sifying country and workforce. 
Another study from the EPI found 59.1 per-
cent of African American workers (7.5 million 
workers) are subject to mandatory arbitration, 
as are female workers (at 57.6 percent). 
Unfortunately, this is not surprising consid-
ering African Americans and women are two 
of the most historically discriminated against 
groups in the United States. 
Forced arbitration continues the struggles of 
African Americans in the workplace, from slav-
ery, sharecropping, and redlining to ongoing 
segregation, discrimination, racism, and voter 
suppression. As these statistics show, our 
struggle for equity in the workplace continues. 
We are exhausted, yet we remain in the 
fight. We must continue to set right historical 
wrongs, and the FAIR Act provides us an ave-
nue to do so. 
Fairness in the workplace for women is also 
further remediated by this legislation. In this 
country, we have a disgraceful wage gap be-
tween men and women of 82 cents to the dol-
lar, according to the latest Bureau of Labor 
Statistics figures. 
As a Member of the Women’s Caucus, I 
have been fighting for pay equity for American 
women since before I arrived here as a Rep-
resentative in 1995, and I believe that equal 
pay for equal work is a simple matter of jus-
tice. 
Wage disparities are not simply a result of 
women’s education levels or life choices. In 
fact, the pay gap between college educated 
men and women starts as soon as they enter 
the workplace and expands shortly thereafter. 
Women can have the same background, work 
in the same field, and perform the same func-
tional position, yet still be grossly underpaid. 
Disproportionately subjecting women to forced 
arbitration is yet another stain on this country’s 
historical attitude towards women in the work-
force. 
I have consistently been a proud sponsor 
and cosponsor of legislation that expands 
legal rights, creates a more level playing field, 
and erodes long standing social disparities. 
The FAIR Act achieves these goals, and I 
therefore urge my colleagues to support the 
FAIR Act. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
On the other side of the aisle, we 
hear repeated references to defending 
the Constitution and the American 
way. I would remind the Chamber that 
our economy, the American economy, 
is built on contracts; which contracts, 
under the rule of law, are not forced, 
but enforced when someone refuses to 
abide by his or her agreement. That is 
not forced. That is where a contract is 
enforced. 
We, our courts, our judicial system, 
and, yes, arbitration is the means by 
which we call people to live by their 
bargains, and that has been the key to 
the most successful economy in the 
history of the world. It has certainly 
been the state of affairs, as I said, for 
almost 100 years. 
Throwing that out, dispensing with a 
major 
component 
of 
that 
on 
the 
premise that you are pursuing the 
American system is contrary to fact. It 
is, as Democrats often seek to do, it is 
transformational. It seeks to transform 
America, not to reinforce and persist 
it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
b 1300 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman is absolutely right. The 
bill purports to assert a very important 
constitutional right, the right to trial 
by jury in civil actions. But it does so 
by denying everyone a very important 
other constitutional right, the freedom 
of unimpaired contract, the right of 
two parties to agree to exchange goods 
and services according to their own 
best judgment. 
Now, because of the excesses and ex-
penses and uncertainties that have 
plagued our civil courts, many con-
sumers and producers, and many em-
ployees and employers, find it advan-
tageous to waive their right to civil 
jury trials in any disputes between 
them in favor of a simpler, cheaper, 
and faster arbitration. 
Now, proponents tell us it is an un-
even playing field, and this require-
ment is often imposed in nonnego-
tiable, take-it-or-leave-it propositions. 
This isn’t exactly true. Every employee 
and every consumer, no matter how 
weak and vulnerable, has an absolute 
defense against a bad agreement. It is 
the word ‘‘no.’’ No, the pay isn’t good 
enough. No, the price is too high. No, I 
don’t 
like 
the 
binding 
arbitration 
clause or any other terms, and I am 
taking my business elsewhere. 
Now, even when there aren’t good al-
ternatives, the fact is that every provi-
sion in a contract is a take-it-or-leave- 
it proposition if one side or the other 
insists on it. The question for each side 
is whether the totality of the contract 
is beneficial to them or not. It is every 
grownup’s right to make that decision 
for themselves without somebody in 
government making it for them. 
Remember, the so-called forced arbi-
tration provision forces the company 
to accept arbitration as well. For ex-
ample, I am not a lawyer. I can’t afford 
to hire one to take a big company to 
court. For me, binding arbitration 
helps level the playing field by pro-
viding me with an inexpensive alter-
native that the company must abide 
by. This bill takes that protection 
away from me. 
According to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, through arbitration, em-
ployees prevail three times more often, 
recover twice as much money, and re-
solve their claims more quickly than 
they could through litigation. And in 
most cases, the employer pays the en-
tire cost of arbitration. 
According to one study, in claims be-
tween $10,000 and $75,000, the consumer 
claimant was charged an average of 
$219. Now, you compare that to the cost 
of hiring an attorney and taking on an 
entire corporate legal department. 
The net result of this bill will be 
higher prices for products and lower 
wages for workers as companies factor 
the high cost of litigation into their 
business models. 
Madam Speaker, that is not fair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from California for his re-
marks.

March 17, 2022 
It causes me to remark, as the gen-
tleman from Tennessee said a moment 
ago, that it is Democrats who look out 
for the interests of the little guy and 
look out for the interests of the people. 
I wonder why it is that looking out for 
the interests of the people invariably 
involves restricting their freedom in 
some way. What a remarkable notion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL), a member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Forced Arbitration Injus-
tice Repeal Act. 
Forced arbitration deprives workers 
of the choice to have their day in 
court. When companies impose forced 
arbitration clauses, they choose every 
aspect of the process. They choose the 
mediator; they choose the location; 
and they choose the terms of the relief. 
This is a lose-lose scenario, and it 
disproportionately harms workers, par-
ticularly women and communities of 
color, but it imposes enormous con-
sequences for everyone. 
You sign a contract for car repair, for 
car rental, for any consumer trans-
action, and when you need that car 
rental, hidden in those contracts is a 
prohibition from you taking any claim 
to court. No choice, no notion, even, 
for the majority of people that this 
fundamental right to that choice to sue 
an unscrupulous corporation is being 
taken away from you when you sign 
that contract. 
Madam Speaker, I think of this bill 
as a bill for the little guy or the little 
woman. Women and people of color 
forced into arbitration face mostly 
White male arbitrators in environ-
ments that heavily favor corporate in-
terests. 
When musician Jay-Z entered arbi-
tration without a single Black arbi-
trator in the room, he asked for 
‘‘neutrals of color.’’ But only three 
suggested alternatives were Black, one 
of whom was a partner at the law firm 
representing the opposing party. 
Eliminating forced arbitration would 
open the courthouse doors for women, 
for workers of color, for poor folks 
across this country, advancing social 
equity and aiding the fight against dis-
crimination. But it is also the right 
thing for every single consumer to be 
able to pursue this right to a day in 
court. 
Just 
last 
week, President Biden 
signed into law my bill with Represent-
ative CHERI BUSTOS to ban forced arbi-
tration in cases of sexual harassment 
and sexual assault. That will protect 
the right of 60 million workers to a fair 
day in court. And that is just the peo-
ple who are subject to employment 
contracts. 
On top of that, it will apply, and it 
will apply retroactively, to all the con-
tracts around sexual assault and sexual 
harassment. That is huge progress. 
What is good enough in cases of sex-
ual assault and sexual harassment— 
and that bill passed in a bipartisan and 
bicameral way—is good enough for all 
workers. 
It is time to take the next step by 
passing this bill to extend these protec-
tions to a fair day in court across the 
board. 
Again, we emphasize that if some-
body wants arbitration, it doesn’t stop 
that route, but it does say you can’t be 
forced only into this and into denying 
your day in court. 
Now, let’s also be clear that the 
FAIR Act is carefully crafted to pro-
tect unions. It preserves essential 
union bargaining power while creating 
freedoms for nonunionized workers. My 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
have introduced an amendment that 
would undermine that power. This can-
not happen. We cannot allow our Re-
publican 
colleagues 
to 
undermine 
unions and the foundation of our mid-
dle class. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass the FAIR Act, and I 
thank Congressman HANK JOHNSON for 
his leadership. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, one of the things 
that we have heard repeated a number 
of times, as the gentleman from Rhode 
Island suggested and the gentlewoman 
from Washington just said, is that if 
you go to arbitration, the company 
picks the arbitrators, and that is it. 
That is not, in fact, correct. 
Courts police the fundamental fair-
ness of the arbitration process. If there 
is a process that is fundamentally un-
fair, the courts will modify it until it is 
fair. So, that is a misconception. 
Furthermore, it has also been sug-
gested that it is by the whim of the ar-
bitrator what the result is. That is ex-
actly what Mr. CICILLINE, I believe, 
said. That also is erroneous. 
If an arbitrator writes a decision that 
manifests a disregard of the governing 
law, like the soldier who had been in 
arbitration for 8 years that he sug-
gested, the courts will vacate, strike 
down, that arbitration award. 
It is important to know those prem-
ises before you decide what to do on 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 963. 
H.R. 963 undermines freedom of con-
tract as well as consumer choice by 
banning informed, consenting adults 
from freely entering into contracts to 
arbitrate disputes. 
Arbitration generally works well and 
is a fair and effective way to resolve 
disputes. While civil litigation can be 
long, complex, and costly, arbitration 
provides a cheaper and efficient process 
to resolve disputes in a timely manner. 
Banning 
predispute 
arbitration 
agreements would mean Americans 
spend more time in court with no guar-
antee of better outcomes. Banning ar-
bitration agreements during a time of 
significant inflation and in the middle 
of a supply chain crisis will effectively 
lower Americans’ income. 
While larger companies may be able 
to deal with the expense of a slew of 
new lawsuits, this change will cause 
harm to smaller businesses that may 
not survive lengthy and costly litiga-
tion battles. 
Because postdispute arbitrations are 
rare, banning arbitration agreements 
will flood the court system. For one 
thing, some claims that are addressed 
through arbitration now may be indi-
vidualized, making them unsuitable for 
class treatment. 
Even where claims can’t be com-
bined, a plaintiff may still be worse off 
as a class member than he would be 
with the claim in arbitration. This is 
because the benefits of arbitration, 
particularly lower litigation costs, co-
incide with lower revenue for others, 
such as trial lawyers. 
Banning certain predispute arbitra-
tion clauses and similar policy will 
benefit trial lawyers, not necessarily 
consumers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this legislation. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise as someone 
who in my past life defended corpora-
tions and entities that often had man-
datory arbitration clauses in their con-
tracts. As such, I am uniquely qualified 
to address the myths that have been 
perpetuated about the FAIR Act. By 
the way, ‘‘myths’’ is a polite term for 
‘‘lies.’’ 
One has to consider that if we believe 
these claims that forced arbitration is 
cheaper, fairer, and faster, then surely 
workers and consumers would volun-
tarily choose it. So, there is no harm in 
restoring 
Americans’ 
freedom 
to 
choose for themselves how to seek jus-
tice. 
First myth: The FAIR Act eliminates 
arbitration entirely, and no one will 
choose arbitration if it is voluntary. 
Fact: The FAIR Act doesn’t elimi-
nate arbitration, as has been said over 
and over here today. It just prohibits 
forced arbitration and allows both par-
ties to choose arbitration voluntarily 
after a worker’s rights or a consumer’s 
rights have been violated. 
If forced arbitration were instead vol-
untary, the private market would 
incentivize arbitration providers to 
treat both parties fairly and equally so 
that both parties would choose that 
process because they would feel like 
they are getting an equal opportunity 
at justice. 
Second myth: Consumers and work-
ers are more likely to win and get 
higher awards in forced arbitration 
than in court.

March 17, 2022 
Fact: This is a lie. That is the result 
of a misleading study, which delib-
erately cherry-picked data by exclud-
ing all results for the most common 
way consumers and workers file their 
cases in State courts and through class 
actions. 
The Chamber of Commerce only ex-
amined outcomes of individual cases 
filed in Federal court because it knows 
that very few consumer and worker 
cases are filed in Federal court. Ameri-
cans are, in fact, more likely to be 
struck by lightning than they are to 
win a monetary award in a forced arbi-
tration. 
A study based on self-reported data 
from two of the leading private arbitra-
tion providers revealed that, on aver-
age, only approximately 382 consumers 
won a monetary award each year, less 
than the number of people struck by 
lightning every year in the United 
States. While an estimated 60 million 
workers are subject to forced arbitra-
tion clauses, only 82 prevailed in em-
ployment forced arbitration claims in 
2020. 
Third myth: Forced arbitration is 
faster and, as we have heard from some 
people across the aisle, cheaper than 
litigation. 
Another completely false claim is 
based on faulty data from a forced arbi-
tration database, which systematically 
deleted older cases, completely skew-
ing the average length of a case in 
forced arbitration—simple data manip-
ulation. 
The idea that arbitration would pro-
vide consumers a cheaper way to liti-
gate their claims, perhaps suggesting 
that they would do that without a law-
yer, no major company will ever go to 
arbitration without their highly paid 
company lawyers. And every indi-
vidual, whether they are in court or in 
arbitration, would need representation 
against a corporation regardless of the 
forum that they are in. 
Fourth myth: The court system is 
overbooked, so forced arbitration pro-
vides more flexibility for scheduling. 
While more powerful defendants have 
an incentive to drag out resolution of a 
case, that incentive exists whether 
they are in court or arbitration. 
b 1315 
It is in the best interest of the indi-
vidual who is filing the claim to seek 
the fastest possible resolution for his 
or her claim, and that would be done 
regardless of which they choose. 
By 
the 
way, 
corporations 
often 
choose courts over arbitration to re-
solve disputes that they initiate, show-
ing that they do so when it benefits 
them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, myth 
number 5, the FAIR Act violates the 
freedom to contract. This is my favor-
ite one. Whose freedom? That of cor-
porations or Americans? There was a 
comment that we are in the most suc-
cessful economy in the history of the 
world, but for whom? Not necessarily 
for consumers or workers. 
Don’t Americans have the right to 
participate in the economy without 
being forced to forego the rights and 
protections that are afforded to them 
under the law? The United States Con-
stitution’s Seventh Amendment guar-
antees the right to trial by jury for 
every American. 
What if corporations inserted provi-
sions 
into 
their 
contracts 
forcing 
Americans to give up their First or 
Second Amendment rights to get or 
keep a job? Would we still be talking 
about the freedom to contract? 
Finally, the last myth. The FAIR Act 
is retroactive. It is not retroactive. It 
only applies to cases filed on or after 
the date of enactment. We need a level 
playing field between corporations and 
industries and the people who find 
themselves aggrieved by them. The ar-
bitration process—make no mistake 
about it—is a private process. People 
bringing their claims need to be able to 
fairly evaluate the best forum for that 
claim to be adjudicated. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in very strong support of 
ending the use of forced arbitration 
and to restore the right of millions of 
Americans to their day in court. I 
think my colleagues have done a really 
good job on this side of the aisle in ex-
plaining why this is so important for 
basic rights of all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I want to tell you a 
couple things that have happened in Il-
linois. I deal a lot with older Ameri-
cans in my district—as I am sure many 
of you hear from senior citizens—and I 
have heard these really horrific stories 
from families who discover that in 
nursing homes that their loved ones 
have been neglected or abused or even 
worse. 
These families want to do something 
about it. They want to hold these nurs-
ing homes accountable, and then they 
find out that they have quite inadvert-
ently, quite unknowingly have signed a 
forced arbitration agreement. 
Picture these moments. These are 
people who are often in very emotional 
situations. They are bringing their 
loved ones to a nursing home. This is 
never an easy situation. The last thing 
they are thinking about, among all the 
paperwork that is put before them, 
that they have signed away their 
rights. And then they find out that 
something has happened to their loved 
one in a nursing home and they are left 
without the recourse that they need. 
We have too often seen corporations 
who are virtually immune from the 
kind of accountability that they should 
be held to. I think the time is up right 
now. If it is good enough for sexual 
harassment and abuse, it is certainly 
good enough for people in nursing 
homes that have been abused and that 
their families have their day in court. 
Madam Speaker, I support the FAIR 
Act. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I was intrigued by 
the situation we just had on the floor, 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, I 
think she said she represented big cor-
porations. Yet, she spoke to the funda-
mental unfairness of arbitration. It is 
ironic perhaps. 
I spent almost 30 years—29 years in 
the practice of law as a litigator rep-
resenting people in court and in arbi-
tration equally. I represented plaintiffs 
and defendants both, frequently indi-
viduals, often businesses, always small 
to medium-sized businesses, and occa-
sionally a local government or two, 
never a big company. 
I have had clients who didn’t want to 
have arbitration agreements enforced 
and sometimes I could defeat them or 
have them modified or change the re-
sults of them because the arbitrator 
had manifested disregard for the law. 
Sometimes I had clients who wanted to 
enforce those agreements. It depends 
on the circumstances. 
But I can tell you it is not a tool that 
is uniformly bad. Although I have 
voted for accepting enforceable arbi-
tration agreements, arbitration clauses 
involving sexual harassment and sex-
ual assault cases, I don’t believe that 
throwing the baby out with the bath 
water is a good idea. It is a terrible 
idea. 
Let me let America in on the inside 
scoop. Here is what this is about. For 
the past, roughly, decade there have 
been a series of cases in the United 
States 
Supreme 
Court 
in 
which, 
through various efforts and methods, 
plaintiffs’ class action lawyers, lawyers 
for big class litigation where they 
make millions and millions in fees, 
have tried various approaches to get 
the United States Supreme Court to 
allow class actions to be pursued 
through arbitration, and they have 
failed. That is why this bill is here. 
The bill is to reverse the result of 
that decade of litigation in the Su-
preme Court in order for class action 
lawyers to be able to have a field day 
and to make a lot of money. This bill 
protects and seeks the fortune of plain-
tiffs’ class action lawyers, and of 
course, it protects the patronage of big 
unions both at the same time. That is 
what the bill is about. 
Madam Speaker, for that reason, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, in today’s 
economy, signing up for digital services often

H3797 
March 17, 2022 
unknowingly sign away certain rights such as 
filing a lawsuit or joining a class action. The 
Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act 
addresses this rampant abuse of our legal 
system by banning mandatory pre-dispute ar-
bitration clauses in employment, consumer, 
and civil rights cases. 
These forced arbitration clauses are in-
creasingly found in consumer contracts, re-
quiring users to waive their right to sue in a 
court of law and instead resolve any disputes 
through arbitration. Because arbitration is se-
cretive, lacks important due process protec-
tions, and produces decisions that cannot be 
appealed, it too often shields bad actors from 
accountability and prevents consumers from 
enforcing their rights in our justice system. 
Many consumer contracts that include 
forced arbitration clauses empower companies 
to collect unseemly amounts of data from their 
users and abuse that data for profit. The prob-
lem is acute in highly concentrated industries 
where corporations wield significant market 
power because consumers often have little or 
no alternative to these anti-consumers con-
tracts. This model of what’s been labeled ‘‘sur-
veillance capitalism’’ is bolstered by forced ar-
bitration clauses that ensure the most egre-
gious abuses of consumer data cannot be 
challenged in court. My legislation to protect 
consumer privacy, the Online Privacy Act, 
bars the use of forced arbitration clauses in 
user agreements about privacy for this reason. 
No one should be required to sign away 
their right to access our justice system when 
they sign up for a credit card, cell phone plan, 
or social media account. The FAIR Act is crit-
ical legislation to protect the rights of con-
sumers, particularly regarding online privacy. 
I’m proud to be a cosponsor of this important 
legislation, and l urge my colleagues to vote 
for it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate on the bill has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. FITZGERALD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in House Report 117–273. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 6, strike lines 16 through 25. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 979, the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Wisconsin. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, instead of setting 
one standard and having everyone play 
by the same rules, the Democrats have 
singled out the unions for favorable 
treatment. 
This legislation bans predispute arbi-
tration for nonunion employees while 
preserving these benefits for union em-
ployees. This discrepancy makes no 
sense and, unfortunately, smacks of po-
litical favoritism. 
Arbitration offers a faster and cheap-
er path to resolution of a dispute. Tak-
ing this path away from nonunion em-
ployees leaves these workers to the 
mercy of—like we said earlier—the 
high-priced trial lawyers, while union 
workers maintain the benefit of arbi-
tration. 
My amendment would remove this 
carve-out for union employees and re-
store parity between union and non-
union workers. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle already shut down my amend-
ment to limit attorneys’ fees to a rea-
sonable amount so that consumers are 
protected. I am disappointed by that. 
They also rejected my amendment to 
reduce the cost of this bill by exempt-
ing contracts for critical supplies that 
have been affected by the Biden admin-
istration’s supply chain crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
amendment to protect workers, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this amendment, which 
would significantly weaken this legis-
lation and damage the collective bar-
gaining process for tens of millions of 
working Americans. 
We have said it over and over again 
today—this bill is not designed to 
eliminate arbitration. While my Re-
publican colleagues would like you to 
believe that the FAIR Act will end ar-
bitration entirely, that is simply not 
true. 
The FAIR Act would put an end to 
forced arbitration—arbitration that is 
not willingly agreed to by both sides, 
which is a predatory one-sided practice 
created by and for huge corporations to 
allow them to get away with abusive 
conduct. It is a system that can exist 
only when these companies can take 
advantage of a stark power imbalance 
between themselves and workers, con-
sumers, and small businesses. 
Labor unions correct that power im-
balance. 
The 
collective 
bargaining 
process provides real protections that 
are unavailable to nonunion workers 
by forcing big businesses to com-
promise with skilled negotiators fo-
cused on improving terms for their 
workers. 
Collective 
bargaining 
guarantees 
other important protections in the ar-
bitration process, such as truly neutral 
arbitrators, better procedures, trans-
parent decisionmaking, and the option 
to appeal decisions. It creates a system 
that can actually resolve disputes 
quickly, efficiently—and most impor-
tant—fairly for all parties involved. 
That is not forced arbitration pre-
cisely because it is truly voluntary. Ar-
bitration only works when two parties 
of equal bargaining power can nego-
tiate terms that work for everyone in-
volved, which is exactly what happens 
when a labor union and a corporation 
establish a collective bargaining agree-
ment. 
That is completely different than 
forced arbitration of nonunion employ-
ment disputes where an employee is 
forced to accept an arbitration clause 
that is buried deep inside the fine print 
of a stack of confusing paperwork on a 
take-it-or-leave-it basis that they must 
sign to get a job. 
The big corporations love this system 
because it forces their workers, it 
forces employees, it forces the pur-
chasers of products to go to forced ar-
bitration, and that is an inherently 
skewed process. That is why the em-
ployee loses 98 percent of the forced ar-
bitrations. The employer wins 98 per-
cent of the forced arbitrations. That is 
not a fair process. 
Moreover, as my colleague, Congress-
man PERLMUTTER, made clear during 
the Rules Committee meeting on this 
bill, nothing in the FAIR Act prevents 
individual workers from deciding to 
vindicate their rights before a jury. 
As the plain language of the bill 
states, no collectively bargained arbi-
tration provision ‘‘shall have the effect 
of waiving the right of a worker to 
seek judicial enforcement of a right 
arising under a provision of the Con-
stitution of the United States, a State 
constitution, or a Federal or State 
statute, or public policy arising there-
from.’’ 
In other words, this amendment is a 
solution in search of a problem that 
could upend the rights of millions of 
workers today. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment, to vote for the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I inform the gentleman from New York 
that we have no further speakers, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLETCH-
ER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the FAIR Act. 
I have heard some of the debate in this 
Chamber today, and as a litigator, I 
disagree. 
The FAIR Act is about restoring jus-
tice for the American people. It is for 
consumers, it for workers, it is for 
small business people, it is for people 
whose civil rights have been violated, 
it is for millions of Americans who are 
denied their right to seek justice and 
accountability because of forced arbi-
tration. 
There is certainly a role for arbitra-
tion of disputes and other forms of al-
ternative dispute resolution in our sys-
tem of justice. I know this from my 
own experience representing individ-
uals and organizations in the courts 
and before arbitrators. 
The FAIR Act is important because 
it recognizes the role arbitration can 
play in resolving disputes between will-
ing parties while it recognizes the fun-
damental rights of the people who have

been subjected to arbitration agree-
ments without their true consent. 
The FAIR Act protects the freedom 
to contract, the freedom of choice, and 
the freedom granted in our Constitu-
tion, including the Seventh Amend-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
b 1330 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time, and I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I would simply urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, there are over 60 
million workers—a majority of non-
union private-sector employees—who 
are 
subject 
to 
forced 
arbitration 
clauses. According to the Economic 
Policy Institute, that number will be 
over 80 million by 2024. Those employ-
ees are told that if they want to get a 
job or keep their current job they must 
sign away their right to their day in 
court and submit to a forced arbitra-
tion agreement. In most cases they do 
not have a choice. 
When these workers seek to hold 
their employers to account for wage 
theft, civil rights abuses, or racial dis-
crimination, they are shoved into a se-
cretive arbitration process designed by 
corporations with almost unlimited re-
sources, and they lose 98 percent of the 
time. That is what the FAIR Act will 
fix. This legislation will restore these 
workers’ access to our justice system 
and 
guarantee 
their 
constitutional 
rights by ending forced arbitration. 
This amendment would do nothing to 
protect workers while undermining 
this important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this unnecessary and 
harmful amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the previous question 
is ordered on the bill and on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of H.R. 963 is 
postponed.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair

EXPRESSING THE HOPE FOR JUS-
TICE 
FOR 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF 
BLOODY SUNDAY 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution (H. Res. 888) expressing 
the hope for justice for the victims of 
Bloody Sunday, one of the most tragic 
of days during the Troubles, on its 50th 
anniversary as well as acknowledging 
the progress made in fostering peace in 
Northern Ireland and on the island of 
Ireland in recent decades, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 888 
Whereas on January 30, 1972, 26 unarmed 
civilians were shot by British soldiers during 
a protest that began peacefully in Derry, re-
sulting in the death of 14 individuals in a 
massacre now known as Bloody Sunday; 
Whereas as a result of the soldiers’ unjusti-
fiable use of force, the individuals known as 
John ‘‘Jackie’’ Duddy, Patrick ‘‘Paddy’’ 
Doherty, Bernard ‘‘Barney’’ McGuigan, Hugh 
Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, Michael Kelly, 
John Young, William Nash, Michael McDaid, 
James 
Wray, 
Gerald 
Donaghy, 
Gerard 
McKinney, William McKinney, and John 
Johnston tragically lost their lives; 
Whereas Bloody Sunday was one of the 
most significant and deadly injustices to 
take place during the Troubles, and exacer-
bated the conflict in Northern Ireland; 
Whereas none of those shot by British 
Army soldiers posed a threat of causing 
death or serious injury, or were doing any-
thing else that could justify their shooting; 
Whereas the families of the victims of 
Bloody Sunday were denied for decades an 
honest and comprehensive assessment of the 
events that took place on Bloody Sunday; 
Whereas in 1998, after campaigns from the 
families of those injured and killed on 
Bloody Sunday, a second inquiry was estab-
lished by the Government of the United 
Kingdom; 
Whereas this second Bloody Sunday In-
quiry found that the shootings that took 
place on Bloody Sunday were the result of 
wrongful actions taken by British soldiers; 
Whereas on June 15, 2010, then-Prime Min-
ister David Cameron while addressing the 
House of Commons apologized on behalf of 
the Government of the United Kingdom say-
ing that the events that took place on 
Bloody Sunday were ‘‘unjustified’’, ‘‘unjusti-
fiable’’, and ‘‘wrong’’; 
Whereas despite these findings and ac-
knowledgment made by the Government of 
the United Kingdom, none of the individuals 
involved in the unlawful use of force that led 
to the murder of 14 innocent civilians on 
Bloody Sunday have been held accountable; 
Whereas the lack of accountability and 
justice provided to those who perished from 
the unlawful use of force on Bloody Sunday 
both erodes trust and is dangerous; 
Whereas accountability and justice for the 
victims of Bloody Sunday, along with all vic-
tims of the Troubles, would represent a step 
towards addressing Northern Ireland’s legacy 
of violence and promote reconciliation; 
Whereas an environment which fosters ac-
countability and justice for the events of the 
Troubles must be established by the Govern-
ment of the United Kingdom and main-
tained; 
Whereas the full implementation of the 
Good Friday Agreement with a devolved gov-
ernment in Northern Ireland as well as 
healthy ‘‘north-south’’ and ‘‘east-west’’ rela-
tions provides appropriate, useful, and pro-
ductive avenues for discussion and negotia-
tion to prevent violence, uphold peace, main-
tain stability, and promote the interests of 
all parties and communities involved; 
Whereas the avoidance of a hard border on 
the island of Ireland is essential for main-
taining the peace resulting from the Good 
Friday Agreement; 
Whereas the full implementation of the 
Northern Ireland Protocol as agreed upon as 
part of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal 
from the European Union will assist in pre-
serving peace and stability on the island of 
Ireland; 
Whereas while progress has been made in 
fostering peace in Northern Ireland and on 
the island of Ireland in recent decades, it is 
in the interest of all parties to foster inter-
community discussions and relations as well 
as integration in civil and societal struc-
tures to promote communication and mutual 
understanding; and 
Whereas on January 30, 2022, peace activ-
ists, concerned individuals, and the descend-
ants of those lost to this violence gathered 
in Derry to mourn, to stand in solidarity 
with victims’ families in their search for jus-
tice, and re-commit themselves to the peace 
process established by the Good Friday 
Agreement: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the violence and killing of 14 
individuals on Bloody Sunday 50 years ago 
and supports justice for the victims and 
their families; 
(2) calls on all parties to take meaningful 
steps toward peace and reconciliation and to 
ensure justice for victims of the Bloody Sun-
day massacre as well as all those affected by 
the Troubles by supporting dialogue and ne-
gotiation between all parties; 
(3) urges the full implementation of the 
Good Friday Agreement to ensure peace and 
stability on the island of Ireland; 
(4) recognizes the findings of the Bloody 
Sunday Inquiry, also known as the Saville 
Inquiry, and calls upon the Government of 
the United Kingdom to support prosecutions 
of individuals who committed unjustifiable 
crimes on Bloody Sunday based on the evi-
dence collected; 
(5) opposes any proposal by the Govern-
ment of the United Kingdom to implement 
amnesty or statute of limitation laws that 
would end or inhibit investigations and pros-
ecutions of crimes committed during the 
Troubles, including on Bloody Sunday; 
(6) calls upon the involved parties to facili-
tate the implementation of the Northern Ire-
land Protocol in the interest of maintaining 
peace and stability on the island of Ireland; 
(7) urges the European Union, including 
the Republic of Ireland, and the United King-
dom to act in good faith with regard to nego-
tiations around Brexit and implementation 
of the Northern Ireland Protocol; 
(8) calls on the people of Northern Ireland 
to foster further integration across commu-
nities and break down cultural, religious, 
and societal barriers that remain; 
(9) supports the devolved government of 
Northern Ireland and recognizes the devolved 
government as a successful outcome and 
tenet of the Good Friday Agreement; and 
(10) supports the continued strong govern-
mental, societal, and cultural relationships 
between the peoples of the United States, the 
United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ire-
land.

March 17, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on H. Res. 
888, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of my resolution expressing 
the hope for justice for the victims of 
Bloody Sunday, one of the most tragic 
days of the Troubles, a violent time 
which lasted 30 years from approxi-
mately 1968 to 1998. 
This resolution acknowledges the 
progress made in fostering peace on the 
island of Ireland in recent decades and 
calls on all parties to come together to 
ensure full implementation of the Good 
Friday Agreement. 
This resolution comes at an impor-
tant time during the 50th-year anniver-
sary of the massacre and on St. Pat-
rick’s Day, a day where people of Irish 
descent around the world remember 
our roots and celebrate our history. I 
am proud the resolution is moving for-
ward on this day of all days. 
First, I thank many of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for their 
sponsorship of this resolution. To the 
original 
cosponsors—Representatives 
RICHIE
NEAL, 
MIKE
KELLY, 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, 
DAVID
CICILLINE, 
JIM 
MCGOVERN, 
NICOLE
MALLIOTAKIS, 
GERRY CONNOLLY, JUAN VARGAS, and 
TOM SUOZZI—and almost 40 other co-
sponsors, I am grateful for their sup-
port and for their longstanding work 
on this issue. 
I also express my deepest gratitude 
to Chair MEEKS, Ranking Member 
MCCAUL, Leader HOYER, and the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee staff for 
their support of this resolution. 
As a member and as a former chair of 
the Europe, Energy, the Environment 
and 
Cyber 
Subcommittee 
himself, 
Chair MEEKS understands firsthand the 
importance of peace and stability on 
the island of Ireland. 
I introduced this resolution to honor 
the lives lost during Bloody Sunday, a 
singular day amidst a long period of 
struggle that exacerbated the conflict 
in Northern Ireland. 
On January 30, 1972, I was a college 
student in Boston, a city known for its 
deep connection to Irish-American cul-
ture. I vividly recall the images and 
displays of unbridled violence during a 
peaceful protest in Derry that rever-
berated throughout the world. Even 
today, I remain deeply affected by the 
actions of British soldiers that led to 
the wounding of 26 unarmed civilians 
and the death of 14 individuals. 
On January 30, 2022, as 50 years had 
passed, I expressed to the families of 
the victims my firm belief that Bloody 
Sunday represents one of the deadliest 
injustices to take place during the 
Troubles. I underline that as we con-
tinue to mourn the loss of those who 
perished that day, we must also advo-
cate for justice while taking the nec-
essary steps to build a more peaceful 
future. 
As I expressed to the families, ac-
countability and justice for the events 
of Bloody Sunday must be achieved to 
ensure a long-lasting peace on the is-
land of Ireland. While it has long been 
acknowledged 
that 
British 
soldiers 
were directly responsible for the mur-
der of civilians on Bloody Sunday, 
those who suffered under this unlawful 
use of force continue to be denied an 
honest assessment of the events that 
took place in 1972. To date, not one of 
the individuals involved has been held 
accountable for their actions. 
I want to state clearly: amnesty pro-
posals by the government of the United 
Kingdom are disrespectful and deny 
due process to Bloody Sunday victims 
and their families. They run counter to 
the spirit of remarks of then-Prime 
Minister David Cameron who termed 
the events as unjustifiable and wrong. 
The evidence is clear: The individuals 
responsible for the violence that took 
place on that fateful day must be 
brought to justice. 
Along with the avoidance of a hard 
border, these legacy issues remain as 
threats to and unfinished business of 
the Good Friday Agreement, an agree-
ment few thought would ever occur. 
Both sides compromised. Its improb-
able success of diplomacy over violence 
inspires us today as Europe and the 
world face its greatest conflict in 80 
years. 
On St. Patrick’s Day we take pride in 
the 
indispensable 
role 
the 
United 
States has played in forging the Good 
Friday Agreement. The Clinton Admin-
istration 
and 
congressional 
leaders 
worked tirelessly over two decades ago 
to implement the Good Friday Agree-
ment and achieve peace through diplo-
macy. I admire the efforts of American 
leaders like Tip O’Neill; Ted Kennedy; 
George Mitchell; and my colleague, 
RICHIE
NEAL, who were all instru-
mental in negotiating a long-lasting 
peace. 
I firmly believe the agreement ac-
companied by the efforts of community 
activists and leaders willing to work 
for peace and commit to a political 
framework was and remains essential 
to creating stability in the region. We 
must continue to support the ongoing 
efforts to promote integration and rec-
onciliation and address the impacts of 
intergenerational trauma. 
Leaders like Monica McWilliams and 
Jane Morrice, as well as countless oth-
ers working on these issues today, rec-
ognize that peace does not begin and 
end only on Good Friday. The work 
they do and the work of others healed 
divided communities and should and 
must go on. 
This resolution not only remembers 
those who lost their lives during the 
Troubles but also recognizes challenges 
and opportunities of maintaining the 
hard-fought peace that followed. Let 
Bloody Sunday serve as a reminder of 
the hard work and pain to achieve har-
mony. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this resolution, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume, Madam Speak-
er. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Mr. KEATING, and wish him a 
happy Saint Patrick’s Day as well as 
thank him for bringing this resolution 
to the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, happy St. Patrick’s 
Day. 
This January marked the 50th anni-
versary of Bloody Sunday when British 
troops in Derry, Northern Ireland, shot 
at a crowd of innocent protesters, kill-
ing 14 people. This unjustified act of vi-
olence marks a low point in the dif-
ficult history of Ireland in the 20th 
century. In fact, Bloody Sunday was 
just one of many tragic episodes during 
the Troubles which lasted 33 years and 
resulted in as many as 3,000 deaths. 
This bipartisan resolution we are 
considering today commemorates this 
solemn anniversary. It also serves to 
remind the world that there is still 
work to be done to achieve full rec-
onciliation and safeguard a lasting 
peace for all Irish people. 
With the support of the United 
States, the 1998 Good Friday Agree-
ment brought an end to the violence 
that characterized the Troubles and 
began a process to establish peace in 
Northern Ireland. Stories about atroc-
ities, violence, and repression began to 
recede from the headlines. Today, 
Northern Ireland’s story is one of pros-
perity, freedom, and peace. 
Issues remain, however, and the 
United States and the U.S. Congress 
must continue to engage strongly in 
the pursuit of an enduring peaceful fu-
ture for Northern Ireland. 
The Good Friday Agreement signed 
in 1998 is the best framework to 
achieve this noble end. While post- 
Brexit arrangements for Northern Ire-
land have posed challenges to this his-
toric 
agreement, 
both 
sides 
have 
worked in good faith to resolve them. 
This resolution also encourages both 
the European Union and Great Britain 
to continue acting in good faith nego-
tiations to implement Brexit’s North-
ern Ireland protocol. 
I support our transatlantic allies’ ef-
forts to find a more workable solution 
for trade not only at the north-south 
Irish land border, but also at the Irish 
Sea border between Northern Ireland 
and Great Britain. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to continue the U.S. legacy of 
supporting a lasting peace in Northern

Ireland by joining me in supporting 
this resolution, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for his support and for his bipar-
tisan efforts at healing and moving for-
ward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
BRENDAN F. BOYLE), who is a friend of 
Ireland and a friend of mine. He is a 
champion of civil rights causes. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts as well as my fellow 
Pennsylvanian, another great Com-
monwealth. You know which one I am 
partial toward. 
Madam Speaker, I not only thank 
Chairman KEATING for his leadership in 
pushing this resolution but also thank 
him for the eloquent words that he just 
spoke. He laid out the situation quite 
clearly. I would like to just briefly 
elaborate. 
b 1345 
Former British Prime Minister David 
Cameron, to his great credit, said these 
words about a decade ago: ‘‘There is no 
doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there 
are no ambiguities. What happened on 
Bloody Sunday was both unjustified 
and unjustifiable. It was wrong.’’ He 
further went on to say: ‘‘I am deeply 
sorry on behalf of the British Govern-
ment.’’ 
Now, despite those truly admirable 
words and despite the findings and ac-
knowledgment 
made 
by 
successive 
British Governments, shamefully, none 
of the individuals involved in the mur-
der of 14 innocent civilians on Bloody 
Sunday have ever been held account-
able. 
This resolution says: ‘‘The lack of ac-
countability and justice provided to 
those who perished from the unlawful 
use of force on Bloody Sunday is both 
shameful and dangerous.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we remember those 
who perished. We also recognize the 
family members of those who were 
harmed and killed on Bloody Sunday 
who fought for decades and decades to 
finally get justice. 
But we must go further than that. A 
few weeks ago, I led a bipartisan let-
ter—and, again, this whole effort has 
been bipartisan, which is always the 
case when it comes to the issue of 
peace in Ireland here in the United 
States. I led a bipartisan letter to ob-
ject to the British Government’s latest 
plan to institute an amnesty, a blanket 
amnesty. I quote from this resolution, 
which is similar to the letter that we 
sent. 
‘‘We oppose any attempt by the Brit-
ish Government to implement amnesty 
or statute of limitation laws that 
would end or inhibit investigations and 
prosecutions of crimes committed dur-
ing the Troubles, including on Bloody 
Sunday.’’ 
The resolution further goes on to 
talk about today and: ‘‘Calls upon the 
involved parties to fully implement the 
Northern Ireland Protocol as agreed 
upon in the interest of maintaining 
peace and stability on the island of Ire-
land.’’ 
Madam Speaker, today, in the United 
States and around the world, as we cel-
ebrate St. Patrick’s Day, all of us, 
whether like me of Irish descent or not, 
let us also make sure that we don’t 
lose sight of this important civil rights 
issue. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), a champion 
of the Good Friday Agreement, a per-
son who I mentioned in my remarks 
was there at the time, working to 
make it successful. Ireland and the 
Good Friday Agreement have no great-
er leader and supporter. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Massachusetts and 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania, 
both friends of ours, for their words. 
On this very important day, St. Pat-
rick’s Day, we are acknowledging a 
very important anniversary. Anybody 
who knows much about Irish history 
knows that anniversaries are very im-
portant. The acknowledgment of cer-
tain events that occurred throughout 
the sometimes perilous history of this 
small country of 6 million people, 
north and south, are reminded of just 
how grim Bloody Sunday was. 
I knew those families. I recall when 
the former Prime Minister of the U.K., 
David Cameron, acknowledged years 
after in a public statement, in a speech 
that he made on the floor of the House 
of Commons, the then-Prime Minister 
acknowledged that Bloody Sunday had 
victimized innocent bystanders. 
For a long time, the argument had 
been 
made 
that 
these 
were 
paramilitaries on both sides. It was 
only the test of history that fully ac-
knowledged the truth of what happened 
on that day. 
Their civil rights movement in the 
north was modeled, in some measure, 
upon the civil rights movement here in 
America. I knew John Hume very well. 
He was a great man at a great moment. 
I have known Gerry Adams and others 
who participated in these very difficult 
events. But out of this tumultuous 
time came something else, and that 
was the Good Friday Agreement. 
We are now coming upon the 25th an-
niversary of that agreement. America 
is a guarantor of the Good Friday 
Agreement. Successive Presidents of 
the United States, Democrat and Re-
publican, have all embraced the Good 
Friday Agreement as the way forward, 
the path, understanding as well that 
the success of the Good Friday Agree-
ment came about because everybody 
had to give up something. 
The Republic of Ireland gave up Arti-
cles 2 and 3 of its Constitution, which 
laid claim to the six counties of the 
north, and the United Kingdom gave up 
the border, which was a huge issue. 
Strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement 
reinforced the idea of a growing rela-
tionship between Dublin and Belfast. 
Let me lay this out in perspective, in 
the time I have remaining. 
Thirty years ago, in the north of Ire-
land, there were 30,000 British soldiers 
in an area geographically the size of 
the State of Connecticut. You couldn’t 
go anyplace. It was a militarized zone. 
The Friends of Ireland, which is 40 
years old—always Democrat and Re-
publican, we made sure of it—the suc-
cess of the Good Friday Agreement 
came about because of the goodwill of 
the men and women who live on that 
island. 
We should be celebrating the out-
come of the Good Friday Agreement. 
But part of it is also acknowledging 
these perilous moments in Irish his-
tory. I suspect that we will be dis-
cussing for years to come Americans’ 
dimension to bringing about the Good 
Friday Agreement. 
Just think of it: Two generations of 
children have now grown up in this 
small, six-county area not knowing 
anything about the violence. 
It was the reach and the role of the 
United States, an honest broker, that 
helped bring about that agreement, 
which, even with bumps, people have 
fully acknowledged it has worked. So 
the template is there. 
As we celebrate the ancient culture 
of St. Patrick’s Day, there is some-
thing else for people of subjugation, oc-
cupation, An Gorta Mor, as the Great 
Famine is known, or civil wars, risings, 
and revolutions, that indomitable spir-
it on that tiny island, which we just 
celebrated, Republican and Democrat, 
with the President of the United 
States, 
last 
evening 
with 
the 
Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of Ire-
land, talking about the lasting bond 
between the two countries. 
I hope that people will use the exam-
ple of what the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts and the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania have done today, because they 
have acknowledged this very important 
moment. 
What happened on Bloody Sunday, 
the world had a chance to witness, and 
it helped shape world opinion. Thank 
you both for doing this today. There is 
not a better way to honor St. Patrick 
than what you two have laid out today. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a cham-
pion of civil rights here in this coun-
try, a civil rights movement in this 
country that helped inspire the Good 
Friday Agreement. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished gentleman 
from Massachusetts for his leadership. 
How honored I am to be on the floor 
with RICHARD NEAL, who had a major 
and forceful engagement in bringing 
about the recognition of those who 
were murdered in 1972. 
I thank my friend and colleague on 
the other side of the aisle for joining in

this bipartisan effort, and I reenforce 
Chairman NEAL’s comments about the 
bipartisan celebration of this great day 
and the great people of Ireland. 
I am happy to be on the floor on St. 
Patrick’s Day, and I wish all of my 
constituents, and friends across the na-
tion of the great green, a happy St. 
Patrick’s Day. But I come to make 
sure this day, Bloody Sunday, is cer-
tainly not forgotten. 
I am so glad Chairman NEAL indi-
cated its inspiration came from the toil 
and the soldiers on the battlefield, 
Madam Speaker, our beloved friend 
John Lewis, in the civil rights move-
ment, and those who are willing to sac-
rifice for their belief and justice. 
I am so glad that we ultimately 
found the truth to recognize John 
‘‘Jackie’’ 
Duddy, 
Patrick 
‘‘Paddy’’ 
Doherty, Bernard ‘‘Barney’’ McGuigan, 
Hugh Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, MI-
CHAEL
KELLY, John Young, William 
Nash, Michael McDaid, James ‘‘Jim’’ 
Wray, Gerald Donaghy, Gerald McKin-
ney, William ‘‘Willie’’ McKinney, and 
John Johnston, who tragically lost 
their lives. 
As this resolution indicates, British 
soldiers came and shot them down. 
They did not understand their seeking 
of dignity and the rights that they had. 
So Bloody Sunday almost tracked 
some of the terrible issues that we had, 
but these people died and were injured, 
and many families for decades were de-
nied truth. 
I think it is very important that we 
stand on the floor today in a bipartisan 
way to honor that and to applaud 
Prime Minister David Cameron, who 
went to the House of Commons and 
apologized and said that the events 
that took place on Bloody Sunday were 
unjustified, unjustifiable, and wrong. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
how sad and maybe even criminal it 
was to ignore this for so many years. 
How grateful we would be when those 
who died for their rights, for justice, 
for equality, the very same tenets we 
all adhere to here in the United States. 
Let me draw in now and conclude my 
remarks by joining in the resolution 
that urges the European Union, includ-
ing the Republic of Ireland and the 
United Kingdom, to act in good faith 
with regard to negotiations around 
Brexit and the implementation of the 
Northern Ireland Protocol. But more 
importantly, let me emphasize the im-
portance of the relationship between 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
the 
United 
States, and Ireland. Let me track the 
fact that we believe in justice, we be-
lieve in civil rights, and we believe in 
the idea of the speech of empowerment 
and the speech of democracy. 
Let us not resort to bloodiness and 
the killing of those who simply seek to 
speak for justice for them and their 
families. 
Today, in commemoration of Bloody 
Sunday, never again. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 
888, which expresses the hope for justice for 
the victims of Bloody Sunday, one of the most 
tragic of days during the Troubles, on its 50th 
anniversary, as well as acknowledging the 
progress made in fostering peace in Northern 
Ireland and on the island of Ireland in recent 
decades. 
On January 30, 1972, 26 unarmed civilians 
were shot by British soldiers during a protest 
that began peacefully in Derry, resulting in the 
death of 14 individuals in a massacre now 
known as Bloody Sunday, or the Bogside 
Massacre. 
Bloody Sunday is one of the most significant 
and deadly injustices to take place during the 
Troubles—also known as the Northern Ireland 
conflict—and describes the struggle between 
Irish Roman Catholics and British who sided 
with Irish Protestants that lasted from the 
1960s until 1998. 
None of the 26 unarmed people shot by 
British Army soldiers posed a threat of causing 
death or serious injury, or were doing anything 
that could justify their shooting. 
The families of these victims were denied 
for decades an honest and comprehensive as-
sessment of the events that took place on 
Bloody Sunday. 
In 1998, after campaigns from the families 
of those injured and killed on Bloody Sunday, 
a second inquiry was established by the Brit-
ish Government, and it found without doubt 
that the shootings were the result of wrongful 
actions taken by British soldiers. 
The lack of accountability and justice pro-
vided to those who perished and their families 
from this heinous use of force was unaccept-
able. They deserved justice. 
Accountability and justice for the victims of 
Bloody Sunday would represent a step toward 
addressing Northern Ireland’s legacy of vio-
lence and promoting reconciliation. 
This conflict was rooted in suppression, si-
lencing the voices of those who differ from you 
by taking away their freedoms and their lib-
erties. 
As an African American woman in the 
United States, I know too well the struggles of 
oppression. 
The march led by our Beloved John Lewis 
from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama that re-
sulted in the brutal beating of marchers by po-
lice is known as Bloody Sunday is a turning 
point in the civil rights struggle. 
I stand with the victims of Bloody Sunday, 
because whenever oppression happens any-
where around the world, and people risk los-
ing their freedoms and their liberty, I will al-
ways stand with them. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I do thank my col-
leagues for their articulate, eloquent, 
and important words: Chairman NEAL, 
my 
friend 
Representative 
BOYLE, 
Chairman KEATING, and Representative 
JACKSON Lee. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I again 
thank Chairman KEATING for his work 
on this bipartisan resolution to com-
memorate the anniversary of a tragic 
time in Northern Ireland. 
It is fitting we are considering this 
resolution on St. Patrick’s Day, a day 
when many Americans proudly display 
their Irish heritage, including my own 
family. My mother, formerly Maeve 
McMenomy; her father, my grand-
father, Philip McMenomy, who de-
scended directly from Ireland. As a 
matter of fact, my mother’s mother 
was from Ukraine. 
As you can imagine, we know how to 
get our Irish up in our family and 
enjoy St. Patrick’s Day and also reflect 
on the important history in Ireland as 
well as the very unwarranted and dead-
ly and destructive events taking place 
in Ukraine currently. 
Today, we can also say that we are at 
peace, perhaps proud. The scenes of vi-
olence from the past years in Ireland 
have subsided that have reigned for 
more than 20 years. 
I was sorry to hear that the Irish 
Prime Minister tested positive for 
COVID yesterday, so we all wish him a 
speedy recovery. 
I do look forward to the United 
States and Ireland continuing to build 
on our strong relationship and advance 
our shared interests. 
This resolution is important right 
now, because we have had, Madam 
Speaker, far too many Bloody Sundays, 
including in the United States. March 
7, 1965, was a terrible Bloody Sunday in 
Selma, Alabama. The last several Sun-
days in Ukraine have been as well, with 
unnecessary bloodshed without jus-
tification. 
In the words of a good Irishman, 
Bono of the band U2: ‘‘No more.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this resolution. It is critical 
that the U.S. Congress speaks with one 
voice toward promoting lasting peace 
and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, Representative MEUSER, for his 
very eloquent remarks and his bipar-
tisan support and leadership on this 
issue for Ireland. 
I want to record and reflect upon the 
people lost during these tragic events 
marked by Bloody Sunday. They are 
John ‘‘Jack’’ Duddy, Patrick ‘‘Paddy’’ 
Doherty, Bernard ‘‘Barney’’ McGuigan, 
Hugh Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, Mi-
chael Kelly, John Young, William 
Nash, Michael McDaid, James Wray, 
Gerald Donaghy, Gerard McKinney, 
William McKinney, and John Johnston. 
We need to remember and memori-
alize these people, young and old, who 
stood peacefully, and in defiance, in 
their support for their values. 
While many, rightfully so, have been 
commended for their work to bring 
peace to the island of Ireland, the vic-
tims of the Bloody Sunday massacre 
made the ultimate sacrifice, fighting 
against 
repression 
and 
demanding 
peace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3802 
March 17, 2022 
To the victims of Bloody Sunday; all 
victims of The Troubles, including the 
disappeared; the families of the vic-
tims; and the people of Ireland and 
Northern Ireland, I say this directly to 
you: We, in Congress, remember. We, in 
Congress, stand with you. We, in Con-
gress, know there is much more work 
still to be done. 
I introduced this resolution to dem-
onstrate our solidarity with you, and I 
urge passage to signal that we will con-
tinue to fight for peace and stability on 
the island of Ireland. 
With that spirit, I wish you all a 
happy St. Patrick’s Day, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to join us by voting in 
the affirmative on this important reso-
lution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. KEATING) that the House suspend 
the rules and agree to the resolution, 
H. Res. 888, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution 
condemning the killing of 14 individ-
uals and violence on Bloody Sunday, 
one of the most tragic of days during 
the Troubles 50 years ago, and calling 
on all parties to take meaningful steps 
toward peace and reconciliation.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
SUSPENDING NORMAL TRADE RE-
LATIONS 
WITH 
RUSSIA 
AND 
BELARUS ACT 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7108) to suspend normal trade re-
lations treatment for the Russian Fed-
eration and the Republic of Belarus, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7108 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suspending 
Normal Trade Relations with Russia and 
Belarus Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and 
is committed to ensuring that the WTO re-
mains an effective forum for peaceful eco-
nomic engagement. 
(2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that 
is entitled to enter into agreements with 
other sovereign states and to full respect of 
its territorial integrity. 
(3) The United States will be unwavering in 
its support for a secure, democratic, and sov-
ereign Ukraine, free to choose its own lead-
ers and future. 
(4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh 
Agreement Establishing the World Trade Or-
ganization (WTO Agreement) and has been a 
WTO member since 2008. 
(5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO 
Agreement creates both rights and obliga-
tions vis-a`-vis other WTO members. 
(6) The Russian Federation acceded to the 
WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th 
WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus 
has applied to accede to the WTO. 
(7) From the date of its accession, the Rus-
sian Federation committed to apply fully all 
provisions of the WTO. 
(8) The United States Congress authorized 
permanent normal trade relations for the 
Russian Federation through the Russia and 
Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei 
Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act 
of 2012 (Public Law 112–208). 
(9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO 
General Council on March 2, 2022, urging 
that all WTO members take action against 
the Russian Federation and ‘‘consider fur-
ther steps with the view to suspending the 
Russian Federation’s participation in the 
WTO for its violation of the purpose and 
principles of this Organization’’. 
(10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, 
has led the Russian Federation into a war of 
aggression against Ukraine, which— 
(A) denies Ukraine and its people their col-
lective rights to independence, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity; 
(B) constitutes an emergency in inter-
national relations, because it is a situation 
of armed conflict that threatens the peace 
and security of all countries, including the 
United States; and 
(C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to 
participate in international organizations, 
including the WTO. 
(11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a 
ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is 
providing important material support to the 
Russian Federation’s aggression. 
(12) The Russian Federation’s exportation 
of goods in the energy sector is central to its 
ability to wage its war of aggression on 
Ukraine. 
(13) The United States, along with its allies 
and partners, has responded to recent aggres-
sion by the Russian Federation in Ukraine 
by imposing sweeping financial sanctions 
and stringent export controls. 
(14) The United States cannot allow the 
consequences of the Russian Federation’s ac-
tions to go unaddressed, and must lead fel-
low countries, in all fora, including the WTO, 
to impose appropriate consequences for the 
Russian Federation’s aggression.

a joint resolution of disapproval that has 
passed the House of Representatives shall, 
when received in the Senate, be referred to 
the Committee on Finance for consideration 
in accordance with this subsection.

tion of disapproval that has passed the House 
of Representatives, the joint resolution from

ceived in the Senate, be placed on the cal-
endar. If this subparagraph applies, the pro-
cedures in the Senate with respect to a joint 
resolution of disapproval introduced in the 
Senate that contains the identical matter as 
the joint resolution of disapproval that 
passed the House of Representatives shall be 
the same as if no joint resolution of dis-
approval had been received from the House of 
Representatives, except that the vote on pas-
sage in the Senate shall be on the joint reso-
lution of disapproval that passed the House 
of Representatives. 
(7) RULES
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES
AND
SENATE.—This subsection is en-
acted by Congress— 
(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power 
of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, respectively, and as such are deemed a 
part of the rules of each House, respectively, 
but applicable only with respect to the pro-
cedure to be followed in that House in the 
case of legislation described in those sec-
tions, and supersede other rules only to the 
extent that they are inconsistent with such 
rules; and 
(B) with full recognition of the constitu-
tional right of either House to change the 
rules (so far as relating to the procedure of

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BEATTY). Pursuant to the rule, the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BRADY) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday morning, 
Congress heard directly from Ukrain-
ian President Zelenskyy. He showed us 
the absolute horrors that Russia is in-
flicting on the Ukrainian people in full 
view of the world, and he pleaded for us 
to do more. 
With the legislation that stands be-
fore us at this hour, we intend to an-
swer his call. Ranking Member BRADY 
and I have been united in our desire to 
end permanent normal trade relations 
with Russia. And I must say that Mr. 
BRADY has been very consistent as we 
have discussed this legislation. 
With the House passage of H.R. 7108 
today, we will take that impactful step 
and place even greater economic pres-
sure on Putin and his brutal regime. 
We must do everything in our power to 
hold Russia accountable for the atroc-
ities it is committing hourly in the na-
tion of Ukraine. 
This is an unprovoked horror that 
the world is seeing. Our partners and 
allies are joining with us in this effort, 
taking similar steps to further isolate 
Putin and his regime from the rest of 
the civilized world. 
I urge every single one of our col-
leagues today to support the Ukrainian 
people, punish Russia for its ruthless 
aggression, and vote to advance this 
measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday, Presi-
dent Zelenskyy made a passionate plea 
to the United States and all free na-
tions to stand with the brave people of 
Ukraine against Putin’s deadly ambi-
tions and heartbreaking genocide. 
After showing gut-wrenching footage 
of Ukrainian cities torn apart by mis-
siles and machine guns, he said to be 
the leader of the world means to be the 
leader of peace. 
Today, Madam Speaker, we have the 
opportunity to lead, and I thank Chair-
man NEAL for his great leadership and 
work on this bipartisan provision. 
After bipartisan public pressure from 
lawmakers in Congress in both parties, 
President Biden announced his support 
for suspending Russia’s special trade 
status. We are taking that action with 
today’s bill. 
I was proud to have helped lead this 
bipartisan effort in the House Ways 
and Means Committee and the Senate 
Finance Committee. Both parties in 
Congress came together quickly, work-
ing in good faith on a bipartisan and 
bicameral agreement to immediately 
ban purchases of Russian energy and 
suspend our trading relationship with 
Russia and Belarus. 
We don’t take these steps lightly, but 
Russia’s aggression requires this ap-
proach. 
Russia will no longer enjoy the same 
special trade status with America as 
the country it is invading, so it will no 
longer be able to sell made-in-Russia 
products in the United States at lower 
tariffs. 
Combined with the energy import 
ban Congress passed last week, which 
targets 60 percent of what Russia sells 
us, this provision targets the remain-
ing 40 percent, hurting Russia’s econ-
omy and cutting off funding for its war 
effort. 
Said another way, American dollars 
will no longer fund Russia’s war ma-
chine. This is another step in the right 
direction and includes further incen-
tives for Russia to end its aggression. 
This bill includes tough conditions to 
be met for restoring Russia’s trade sta-
tus, including Russian action to end 
hostilities, protecting the freedom and 
sovereignty of Ukraine, and ensuring 
the end of Russia’s aggression. 
The same tough conditions apply if 
the President seeks to end the energy 
import ban, and I plan to work with 
colleagues in the Senate to achieve 
that. 
Going forward, we must continue to 
work closely with our allies to increase

pressure on Russia and ensure this is 
an effective global effort. Neighboring 
Canada has also taken serious action 
to do both of these, and other nations 
have announced their intentions to do 
the same. 
Unfortunately, the administration’s 
executive orders and the bill we are 
voting on today both fail to soften the 
impact of the oil ban by replacing Rus-
sian oil with made-in-America energy. 
We have seen the highest year-over- 
year increase in wholesale prices ever 
recorded. Nearly half the price in-
creases in goods come from the rise in 
the price of gasoline over the past year. 
Nothing in this bill creates access to 
more American-made energy on- and 
offshore, nor does it approve American 
pipelines that could easily replace Rus-
sian oil with U.S. and Canadian energy, 
or accelerate approval for delayed per-
mits for American export facilities to 
help the world wean themselves from 
the grip of dirty Russian energy. 
There is still yet more Congress can 
do. I would like to see Congress sanc-
tion Russian energy companies so they 
can’t continue to profit and fuel the 
war machine. 
It is also time for Congress to un-
leash America’s own ability to be en-
ergy independent, replace Russian oil 
with American sources, and use our en-
ergy strengths to wean the world from 
Russian energy. 
Finally, I want to make it clear to 
my colleagues: This bipartisan and bi-
cameral agreement applies only to the 
suspension of normal trade relations 
with Russia. I do not support the inclu-
sion of the Democrats’ Foreign Affairs 
Committee’s Global Magnitsky Act in 
this bill, which includes changes to the 
original statute that I believe are un-
necessarily vague and could lead to fu-
ture abuses. 
I understand this expanded language 
may have been included in a temporary 
executive order by the previous admin-
istration to address human rights, but 
I don’t believe it is warranted in a per-
manent expansion of this law. I am 
confident there are Senators who share 
my concerns, and I strongly urge them 
to remove that provision for future 
vetting. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), the chairman of the 
Trade Subcommittee who has been a 
real leader on this issue. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
it is great to see the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) come to-
gether with the ranking member. 
Congressman DOGGETT and I intro-
duced legislation 3 weeks ago. This 
completes what we had. I am sorry 
that we were unable to move forward, 
but I am pleased that the White House 
now feels comfortable moving forward 
with this legislation. 
It is important that we are moving in 
concert with our allies, but I think we 
need that sense of urgency, based on 
what we heard again yesterday from 
President Zelenskyy. 
What we have done in Congress with 
the administration has damaged the 
Russian economy for decades, watching 
what has happened in terms of the col-
lapse of the ruble, the cratering of 
their stock market, raising the cost of 
living for ordinary Russians, not just 
chasing the yachts of the oligarchs. 
We have a quarter of the WTO that 
accounts for about 58 percent of the 
global domestic product. Moving to 
suspend this MFN standing means the 
Russian economy will face higher tariff 
rates, export bans, investment restric-
tions, export licensing requirements, 
customs hurdles, restrictions on cross- 
border services, and unequal treatment 
for intellectual property and rules of 
origin. 
All of these further cripple the Rus-
sian economy. This is another tight-
ening of that noose, sending a signal. 
I hope there is more that we can do 
economically in terms of weapons, 
maybe even find a way to get MiGs to 
the Ukrainians without starting World 
War III. 
But in the meantime, it is critical to 
move forward, to finish the job we 
started 3 weeks ago. I am pleased to 
support it. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
west 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
suspending Russia’s normal trade rela-
tion status with the United States is 
the right and absolutely necessary 
thing to do. 
I have to note, Madam Speaker, that 
our President continues to take an in-
cremental and piecemeal response to 
Vladimir Putin and this unprovoked 
attack on Ukraine. It is wholly inad-
equate. Not only will it not deter this 
tyrant, I fear it will embolden other 
adversaries to follow suit. 
Madam Speaker, we have to stop as-
saulting oil and gas. This has to be an 
early warning to the United States and 
lawmakers. 
We can steward the environment. We 
should. But we have to understand the 
geopolitical importance of energy inde-
pendence. We can do both. This is 
America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, all of my colleagues, Repub-
licans and Democrats, to support this 
suspension. But I urge my President: 
Be more resolute. Act with a sense of 
urgency. Provide the war machines and 
weaponry that the Ukrainians need to 
fight for their freedom and independ-
ence. 
God bless America. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT), who has been a real 
leader on this issue as well. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, the 
day after Russia invaded Ukraine, I in-
troduced the centerpiece of today’s leg-
islation 
with 
Congressman 
BLU-
MENAUER. It denied Russia preferential 
trade treatment and would expel it 
from the World Trade Organization. 
At that time, 3 weeks ago, there was 
hope that economic sanctions like this 
might limit the extent of Putin’s bru-
tal aggression. Now we have seen that 
economic sanctions are having no im-
mediate impact to limit the slaughter 
from 
Putin’s 
war 
of 
annihilation 
against Ukraine. 
Uniting the world to isolate Russia 
has weakened the ruble, certainly, but 
it has not stopped Putin from reducing 
so much of Ukraine to rubble. 
While I favor excluding every pos-
sible Russian import, this bill will 
grant President Biden appropriate au-
thority to raise tariffs significantly on 
any Russian import that is permitted, 
and the same for Belarus. 
This is largely the same bill on which 
I sought action last week until Presi-
dent Biden requested a delay. 
b 1415 
Surprisingly, this bill does not in-
clude the ban on Russian energy im-
ports that this House approved over-
whelmingly last week on the bill that 
we considered then. I hope that ban 
will be restored in further work on the 
legislation. 
Though important to finally approve 
this bill as another way to isolate Rus-
sia, we should recognize there is no 
substitute for getting Ukrainians all of 
the weaponry that they have re-
quested, including jet fighters, to stop 
the mass murder we observe daily. 
The financial pain imposed won’t im-
mediately ease the pain of Ukrainian 
families. They are paying in blood 
while we pay in dollars, but it is one 
way for us to hold Putin accountable 
and to act in solidarity with them. 
To those who ask that we adopt fur-
ther sanctions or more weapons only if 
Russia does something more, I say 
what more barbaric butchery need we 
see before doing everything we possibly 
can, short of sending troops into 
Ukraine. The time to do everything is 
now, the time to provide for Ukrainian 
refugees to enter our country is now. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), the Republican 
leader of the Trade Subcommittee. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to support the 
long overdue legislation to hold Russia 
accountable 
for 
its 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. It is unfortunate it took so 
long to get to this point, but I am glad 
we have finally reached a consensus. 
This bill, as you know, revokes per-
manent normal trade relations for Rus-
sia and normal trade relations for 
Belarus, putting them in the same 
trade category as North Korea and 
Cuba, and appropriately so. 
The U.S. must take the lead in show-
ing the real economic consequences of 
violent acts against NATO members 
and partners, and this bill is a key ele-
ment of that. 
We were all moved by President 
Zelenskyy’s address earlier this week,

and I am glad we are finally answering 
his call for additional assistance. We 
can and should do more, especially 
when it comes to banning energy im-
ports from Russia. 
As Republican leader of the Trade 
Subcommittee, I am glad this bill is fi-
nally seeing a vote on the House floor. 
I support this bill and certainly urge 
my colleagues to do the same so we can 
use the trade tools at our disposal to 
hold Vladimir Putin accountable. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), who has had a 
longstanding interest in human rights. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, the Putin regime re-
quires every strategy and every action 
that we can muster to put a stop to 
Russia and restore sanity to our world 
order. 
Russia’s aggressive and brutal behav-
ior, brutal actions towards Ukraine is 
beyond what I call the pale. We have no 
other choice but to step in and put a 
stop to it. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this resolution. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. CRAWFORD). 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 7108. Ev-
eryone here on the floor with me today 
can agree that Russia’s aggression in 
Ukraine with Belarus in support is rep-
rehensible and wrong. 
While I strongly believe that this 
next round of sanctions will continue 
to hold Russia and Belarus account-
able, we also can’t ignore soaring fer-
tilizer costs already propelled by global 
supply 
chain 
issues. 
Russia 
and 
Belarus, unfortunately, are major ex-
porters of fertilizer and these sanctions 
may drive costs even higher. 
But 
skyrocketing 
fertilizer 
costs 
won’t affect my support for this bill. 
Peace must be achieved by all avail-
able measures. I will turn my focus 
now to solutions to drive fertilizer 
costs back down. 
From 
temporarily 
or 
completely 
eliminating barriers for fertilizer trade 
from other nations, to input subsidies 
for our producers to offset input costs, 
we must be willing to put all available 
solutions on the table. 
I have always argued that food secu-
rity is national security, and I will 
continue to work with my colleagues 
to alleviate fertilizer costs to our farm-
ers in order to grow food for our 
shelves. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE), a 
champion of human rights everywhere. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, the world right 
now, not just Ukraine, but indeed the 
world, is engaged in a fight between de-
mocracy and autocracy. That is what 
is at stake on what is now the battle-
fields of Ukraine. 
I was in Brussels 3 weeks ago at 
NATO, and I am proud to say I have 
never seen the West and the trans-
atlantic alliance this united. Certainly, 
not since the days of the Cold War. 
Madam Speaker, our trade policy 
must work in sync with our foreign 
policy. That is what we are doing here 
today by revoking this status on Rus-
sia as well as Belarus. I strongly sup-
port it. I am proud of the fact that the 
United States and other countries have 
acted so quickly, in just a matter of a 
few weeks, to put the strongest sanc-
tions on Russia in American history. 
We must do this, and we must do 
even more. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. SPARTZ), the first Ukrain-
ian-born Member of the United States 
Congress. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Suspending Normal 
Trade 
Relations 
with 
Russia 
and 
Belarus Act. It is very important to 
highlight here that we are do include 
Belarus in this act. Unfortunately, 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
President 
Lukashenko, Belarus allowed Russians 
to place ballistic rockets and shell fel-
low 
Slavs, 
orthodox 
Christians 
in 
Ukraine for weeks. The people of 
Belarus need to understand that their 
leader is part of what is happening in 
this genocide in Ukraine, and we can-
not create a loophole where Putin is 
going to use Belarus to funnel moneys 
through them. 
This is very important legislation 
also to send a message to Putin and his 
allies that the West is serious. It is not 
a temporary thing. They cannot just go 
kill a bunch of people, destroy cities, 
kill women and children, and then go 
back and have business as usual. 
Congress is sending a very strong 
message. If they want to have peace, it 
better be soon, and they better get to 
the table and stop this insanity in kill-
ing of the Ukrainian people. 
I also want to share some of the con-
cerns that the Congressman shared re-
garding the Global Magnitsky Human 
Rights Accountability Act. I concur 
with him that these definitions have to 
be tightened and to broaden these defi-
nitions is giving too much power to the 
executive branch. It is not what Con-
gress should do because every time we 
give too much power, we are not able 
to effectively have our oversight func-
tion. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
this important legislation but also 
work with the Senate to make sure 
that we can fix our concerns. I am very 
appreciative that we are able to come 
on a bipartisan basis and send a very 
strong message. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), whose entire ca-
reer has been consistently based on the 
advancement of human rights every-
where. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I congratulate him on his leadership. 
The connection between human rights 
and economics is a connection that 
many of us have seen for a while. When 
it comes to some countries, for exam-
ple China, when I was trying to get an 
adjustment in trade with China based 
on human rights, I was told, Oh, blah, 
blah, blah. But I said then and I say 
now of Russia, if we do not speak out 
for human rights because of commer-
cial interests, we lose all moral author-
ity to speak out for human rights in 
any small country in the world if these 
big countries are left off the hook. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
as 
we 
convene 
today, war rages in Ukraine. Yester-
day, the Congress had the great honor 
and privilege of receiving a virtual ad-
dress by President Zelenskyy, whose 
heroic leadership has rallied his nation 
and inspired the world. Our Members 
were very moved by his powerful re-
marks as well as the heart-wrenching 
footage he shared showing the terror 
and brutality which Putin has un-
leashed in Ukraine, including commit-
ting war crimes against children. 
So it is with great respect for Presi-
dent Zelenskyy’s leadership and with 
unwavering support for the people of 
Ukraine that the House today takes 
another strong step to punish Russia 
for its war crimes. 
It is my hope that this legislation re-
ceives strong bipartisan support, and I 
thank the chairman, Mr. NEAL, and the 
ranking member, Mr. BRADY, for work-
ing together to make that a reality be-
cause it is a recognition that is worthy 
of the valor and courage of the people 
of Ukraine. 
The 
unimaginable 
courage, 
resil-
ience, 
and 
determination 
of 
the 
Ukrainian people has been on full dis-
play, as they fight to not only protect 
their homeland but to defend democ-
racy itself. The assault that Putin is 
making on Ukraine is an assault on de-
mocracy writ large. He is so cowardly 
and so insecure; he can’t stand to see a 
democracy across the way from Russia 
for fear that the Russian people will 
see a better way instead of his autoc-
racy. And so the Ukrainians are fight-
ing for democracy writ large. 
Yet, tragically, Putin has repeatedly 
responded by accelerating brutality, 
indiscriminately bombing major cities, 
attacking civilians attempting to evac-
uate the violence, and even murdering 
mothers and babies in a maternity hos-
pital. 
Russia’s cruel and unprovoked inva-
sion has already forced nearly 3 million 
Ukrainians to flee their homes, cre-
ating what the United Nations has 
called the fastest growing refugee cri-
sis in Europe since World War II. 
Because Putin shows no sign of ceas-
ing his horrible aggression, the Con-
gress today will take another step, in 
lockstep with the Biden administration 
and many of our allies, to tighten our 
stranglehold on the Russian economy. 
The legislation the House will pass 
today represents an intense action to 
further isolate Russia and decimate its 
economy. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. 
BRADY and Mr. NEAL for giving us this 
opportunity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3807 
March 17, 2022 
With this bill, the United States will 
suspend permanent normal trade rela-
tions with Russia, which means they 
will no longer enjoy preferential tariff 
treatment, take steps to review Rus-
sia’s access to the World Trade Organi-
zation, and reauthorize and strengthen 
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act, so that we can im-
pose even further individual sanctions. 
In doing so, we will make it as dif-
ficult as possible for Russia to do busi-
ness with the United States and our al-
lies, and we will also suspend normal 
trade relations with Belarus for its 
shameful complicity in Russia’s ag-
gression. 
Congress and the country salute 
Ways and Means Chairman RICHARD 
NEAL
and Ranking Member KEVIN 
BRADY, who led the way to steer this 
legislation to the floor and garner 
strong bipartisan support for its pas-
sage. I would also like to thank Con-
gressman LLOYD
DOGGETT
and Con-
gressman EARL BLUMENAUER for their 
relentless leadership in showing that 
the House was ready with this legisla-
tion so we could act quickly and deci-
sively and have the improving touches 
that Mr. BRADY and Mr. NEAL added to 
it. 
The legislation we pass today builds 
on swift, devastating sanctions already 
being imposed on Russia by America 
and our allies. We take this step with 
extraordinary unity not only within 
Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral 
basis, but also between the Congress 
and the administration. 
b 1430 
And we do so with historic coordina-
tion with our neighbors abroad, as the 
members of the G7 and European Union 
have all agreed to revoke most-fa-
vored-nation status from Russia. 
On behalf of the Congress, I salute 
President Biden for unifying our allies 
so that we could move together with 
this crushing blow. And we will con-
tinue working together to make Putin 
accountable for his despicable crimes 
as he violates the sovereignty and ter-
ritorial integrity of Ukraine. 
What Putin is doing in Ukraine, 
bombing civilians, targeting children, 
is outside, Madam Speaker, the circle 
of civilized human behavior. He is com-
mitting war crimes and he must be 
held accountable. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bi-
partisan ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, the 
United States is the greatest market in 
the world to do business with. Our con-
sumer spending is double that of the 
European Union, and more than triple 
that of China. Every country on Earth 
wants to do business with America. 
As we deal with the unjust invasion 
of Ukraine by Russia and continue to 
modernize our Nation’s trade deals, 
like we did with the USMCA, we must 
keep in mind that the American mar-
ketplace is not something that is a 
right. It is a privilege for those that 
uphold international order. 
For far too long, many have over-
looked repeated abuses by certain trad-
ing partners. For whatever reason, 
they decided it was okay for the United 
States to do business with those that 
lie, cheat, and steal in violation of 
international law. 
This has been a terrible mistake. 
Trade, when done right, is a critical 
boost to the economy and our families. 
When done poorly, it enriches our ad-
versaries at the expense of those who 
do uphold the international system. 
It is clear that the unjust invasion of 
Ukraine by Russia cannot stand. Con-
gress must make clear to the world 
that normal trade relations with the 
United States must be reserved for 
honest brokers that adhere to inter-
national order. This is the moment 
when irresponsible trade with the 
United States without consequence 
comes to an end. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), who has 
had a long history as a champion of 
human rights. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I rise today to put the full force of 
the American people and this Congress 
behind dismantling the savage Kremlin 
war machine. 
This 
legislation 
shows 
President 
Zelenskyy, Ukrainians, and the world 
that America will boldly confront Rus-
sia’s savage attacks on the Ukrainian 
people. This bill also holds Belarus to 
account for its complicity in Russia’s 
murderous aggression. 
They each will learn what every ty-
rant must: If you invade another na-
tion, normal trade within our global 
economy is over. 
While President Biden marshals the 
free world to fiscally cripple Putin and 
his oligarchs, this Congress will also 
move to crush Russia’s militarized eco-
nomic might. 
So this legislation also reviews Rus-
sia’s and Belarus’ access to the World 
Trade Organization, and it extends and 
strengthens 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky 
Human 
Rights 
Accountability 
Act, 
both of which will further clip Russia’s 
economic wings. 
The grisly, heartbreaking images 
President Zelenskyy showed us yester-
day made clear that Russia must be 
punished. And with this legislation, the 
people of Ukraine and every global de-
mocracy can count on America to help 
make that happen. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE), 
the Republican leader of the Oversight 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on February 8, President 
Biden said that if Russia invaded 
Ukraine, America would impose crip-
pling sanctions. 
On February 24, President Putin kept 
to his word and invaded Ukraine. Presi-
dent Biden has since then slow-walked 
the sanctions that he promised, those 
crippling sanctions that he promised. 
Today, 3 weeks after the invasion, as 
we have watched on the news as 
Ukrainians 
have 
bravely 
fought, 
outmanned and outgunned, and yet 
they hold on tenaciously to their prop-
erty at horrific costs. Their cities are 
being destroyed. Innocent civilians are 
being shot. Women and children are 
being attacked on the streets. And yet, 
the United States has been slow to 
move. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of this long-overdue bill to sus-
pend permanent normal trade relations 
with 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
Belarus. I am a cosponsor of this legis-
lation and would like to thank Chair-
man NEAL and Ranking Member BRADY 
for their hard work on this issue. 
Last week, the House took the much- 
needed step of blocking oil and gas im-
ports from Russia. When we debated 
that bill last week, I said we should 
have gone much further and should not 
have taken that watered-down ap-
proach. 
The United States must stop pro-
jecting weakness to Putin and his al-
lies. President Biden must live up to 
his word. 
Today, we are finally taking a deci-
sive step to punish Russia for their 
criminal aggression in Ukraine by end-
ing their special treatment as a most- 
favored nation. 
Can you imagine that we have con-
tinued to recognize them as a most-fa-
vored nation for three weeks, in light 
of the horrific war crimes that they are 
committing every day? 
This is an action that only Congress 
can take, and we held off last week at 
the request of the administration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 15 sec-
onds. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, passing this bill will place 
significant tariffs on most of Russia’s 
exports to the United States, further 
defunding Putin’s war machine. 
The bill also gives proclamation au-
thority to the USTR to further raise 
tariffs on Russia’s goods so that Amer-
ican 
purchasers 
will 
stop 
funding 
Putin’s war crimes. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE ) who has been a con-
sistent champion of human rights. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Chairman NEAL and Congress-
men DOGGETT and BLUMENAUER for this 
important statement. 
Slaughter is not a sufficient defini-
tion of what Putin and Putin’s war is 
doing to the innocent Ukrainian peo-
ple. 
I rise in strong support of totally re-
moving from them normal trade rela-
tions, as just a few weeks ago I was on

the border of Lithuania and Belarus, 
where the 30 to 40,000 Russian troops 
were poised, poised, ready to move and 
to slaughter. 
How outrageous, when babies are 
killed, when hospitals with pregnant 
women, when a mother who lost her 
life because her pelvis was crushed, her 
baby and herself died because of Putin. 
They continue to slaughter. They 
continue to destroy historic places. 
They continue to destroy hospitals and 
government buildings, and they are not 
ceasing. 
So glory to Ukraine. We must stand 
with them and realize that their fight 
is our fight. As we in the civil rights 
movement experienced the idea of lack 
of justice, we know that this does not 
even equate to the violence that Russia 
is putting forth. I support this legisla-
tion. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 7108, The 
Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Rus-
sia and Belarus Act. The Act takes decisive 
action to respond to Russia’s continued 
unprovoked attacks on the people of Ukraine 
and holds Belarus accountable for its support 
for 
Russia’s 
aggression. 
This 
legislation 
counters Russia’s unconscionable actions and 
Belarus’ complicity by suspending normal 
trade relations with Russia and Belarus. 
This legislation includes additional provi-
sions to expand the United States’ trade tools 
to stop Russia’s unacceptable and unjust war 
on Ukraine and to hold Belarus accountable 
for its involvement. Specifically, the bill: 
Provides the President with time-limited au-
thority to increase tariffs on products of Russia 
and Belarus, until January 1, 2024; 
Requires the U.S. Trade Representative to 
use the voice and influence of the United 
States to seek suspension of Russia’s partici-
pation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
and to halt Belarus’ WTO accession and ac-
cession-related work; and 
Provides the President with the authority to 
restore normal trade relations with Russia and 
Belarus if these countries have ceased their 
acts of aggression against Ukraine and other 
certain conditions are met. Congress has the 
authority to overrule such decision through a 
congressional disapproval process. 
Since Vladimir Putin began this war, the 
United States has had a relentless and dev-
astating economic response in the form of 
sanctions. 
Even prior to this legislation, the United 
States has already carried out the following 
actions: 
The connection to the U.S. financial system 
for 
Russia’s 
largest 
financial 
institution, 
Sberbank, including 25 subsidiaries, has been 
severed by imposing correspondent and pay-
able-through account sanctions. This action 
restricts Sberbank’s access to transactions 
made in the dollar. Sberbank is the largest 
bank in Russia, holds nearly one-third of the 
overall Russian banking sector’s assets, is 
heavily connected to the global financial sys-
tem, and is systemically critical to the Russian 
financial system. 
Russia’s second largest financial institution, 
VTB Bank (VTB), including 20 subsidiaries, 
have been appropriately subject to full block-
ing sanctions. This action freezes all of VTB’s 
assets touching the U.S financial system and 
prohibits U.S. persons from dealing with them. 
VTB holds nearly one-fifth of the overall Rus-
sian banking sector’s assets, is heavily ex-
posed to the U.S. and western financial sys-
tems and is systemically critical to the Russian 
financial system. 
Full blocking sanctions also extend to the 
three other major Russian financial institutions: 
Bank 
Otkritie, 
Sovcombank 
OJSC, 
and 
Novikombank- and 34 subsidiaries. These 
sanctions freeze any of these institutions’ as-
sets touching the U.S financial system and 
prohibit U.S. persons from dealing with them. 
These financial institutions play a significant 
role in the Russian economy. 
New debt and equity restrictions have been 
imposed on thirteen of the most critical major 
Russian enterprises and entities. This includes 
restrictions on all transactions in, provision of 
financing for, and other dealings in new debt 
of greater than 14 days maturity and new eq-
uity issued by thirteen Russian state-owned 
enterprises and entities: Sberbank, AlfaBank, 
Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Rus-
sian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom 
Neft, 
Transneft, 
Rostelecom, 
RusHydro, 
Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. 
These entities, including companies critical to 
the Russian economy with estimated assets of 
nearly $1.4 trillion, are no longer able to raise 
money through the U.S. market—a key source 
of capital and revenue generation, which limits 
the Kremlin’s ability to raise money for its ac-
tivity. 
There are additional full blocking sanctions 
on Russian elites and their family members: 
Sergei Ivanov (and his son, Sergei), Nikolai 
Patrushev (and his son Andrey), Igor Sechin 
(and his son Ivan), Andrey Puchkov, Yuriy 
Solviev (and two real estate companies he 
owns), 
Galina 
Ulyutina, 
and 
Alexander 
Vedyakhin. This action includes individuals 
who have enriched themselves at the expense 
of the Russian state, and have elevated their 
family members into some of the highest posi-
tion of powers in the country. It also includes 
oligarchs who sit atop Russia’s largest finan-
cial institutions and are responsible for pro-
viding the resources necessary to support 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. This action follows 
up on yesterday’s action targeting Russian 
elites and their family members and cuts them 
off from the U.S. financial system, freezes any 
assets they hold in the United States and 
blocks their travel to the United States. 
Costs on Belarus for supporting a further in-
vasion 
of 
Ukraine 
by 
sanctioning 
24 
Belarusian individuals and entities, including 
targeting Belarus’ military and financial capa-
bilities 
by 
sanctioning 
two 
significant 
Belarusian state-owned banks, nine defense 
firms, and seven regime-connected official and 
elites have been enacted. 
Sweeping restrictions have been imple-
mented on Russia’s military to strike a blow to 
Putin’s military and strategic ambitions. This 
includes measures against military end users, 
including the Russian Ministry of Defense. Ex-
ports of nearly all U.S. items and items pro-
duced in foreign countries using certain U.S.- 
origin software, technology, or equipment will 
be restricted to targeted military end users. 
These comprehensive restrictions apply to the 
Russian Ministry of Defense, including the 
Armed Forces of Russia, wherever located. 
Russia-wide restrictions to choke off Rus-
sia’s import of technological goods critical to a 
diversified economy and Putin’s ability to 
project power are also present. This includes 
Russia-wide denial of exports of sensitive 
technology, primarily targeting the Russian de-
fense, aviation, and maritime sectors to cut off 
Russia’s access to cutting-edge technology. In 
addition to sweeping restrictions on the Rus-
sian-defense sector, the United States govern-
ment will impose Russia-wide restrictions on 
sensitive U.S. technologies produced in for-
eign countries using U.S.-origin software, tech-
nology, or equipment. This includes Russia- 
wide restrictions on semiconductors, tele-
communication, encryption security, lasers, 
sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime 
technologies. These severe and sustained 
controls will cut off Russia’s access to cutting 
edge technology. 
Historical multilateral cooperation serves as 
a force multiplier in restricting more than $50 
billion in key inputs to Russia—impacting far 
more than that in Russia’s production. As a re-
sult of this multilateral coordination, the United 
States has provided an exemption for other 
countries that adopt equally stringent meas-
ures. Countries that adopt substantially similar 
export restrictions are exempted from new 
U.S. licensing requirements for items pro-
duced in their countries. The European Union, 
Australia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and 
the United Kingdom, have already commu-
nicated their plans for parallel actions. This 
unprecedented coordination significantly ex-
pands the scope of restrictions on Russia. 
Further engagement with Allies and partners 
will continue to maximize the impact on Rus-
sia’s military capabilities. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
taking 
further 
action 
against both Russia and Belarus on the inter-
national stage is of the utmost necessity in 
showing our European allies that we are 
steadfast in our opposition to this bloody war. 
The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with 
Russia and Belarus Act does exactly that sym-
bolically and literally, and I am confident it will 
play a role in ending this war. 
It is for that reason, Madam Speaker, that I 
rise in strong support of the Suspending Nor-
mal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus 
Act and urge my colleagues support for the 
Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Suspending normal 
trade relations with Russia is impor-
tant. It is my belief 20 years from now 
the part of this bill that will most be 
remembered is the change in the 
Magnitsky Act, which is normally used 
to sanction foreign elected officials. 
Right now, the Magnitsky Act can be 
used 
only 
for 
defined 
crimes, 
extrajudicial 
killings, 
torture, 
pro-
longed detention without trial. We are 
now opening up that act to unlimited 
human rights, however defined, includ-
ing sanctioning people, for example, 
not following the LGBTQ agenda, or 
not being sufficiently pro-abortion. 
We have heard before this country 
weighing in on countries like the Do-
minican Republic, Hungary, African 
and Latin American countries, using 
our economic might to punish them 
when they don’t adopt our view or I’d 
say the liberal view of Christianity. 
It is with great disappointment that 
people held out and risked whether this

bill would go ahead or not on changing 
the Magnitsky Act. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN) whose work on 
human rights is well known. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, as a 
member, co-chairman of the Helsinki 
Commission, I want to compliment Mr. 
CARDIN and Mr. WICKER and their work 
on this bill, bipartisan, from the Sen-
ate. 
What Russia has done with Ukraine 
is immoral. It is illegal. It is against 
the word, the acts, the intentions of 
every godly character ever. God would 
not have approved. WWJD? 
What Russia has done deserves the 
entire condemnation of the world; and 
everything we can do to condemn them 
and put them out of organized civilized 
society is appropriate because they are 
not acting as a civilized member of so-
ciety. 
I support this bill. I think there is 
not too much we can do to Russia. 
There is not too much that they have 
done to Ukraine and continue to do in 
killing children, and disabled, and or-
phans. They deserve all of the might of 
the United States that we can put on 
them and take away from them. We 
need to punish them with all we have. 
I support the bill entirely. 
Glory to Ukraine. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our distinguished 
majority leader who, again, has been a 
consistent champion of human rights. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts (Mr. NEAL), the chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee for yield-
ing. 
I thank the gentleman from Texas 
for joining in this effort to ensure that 
America speaks with a strong and cer-
tain voice. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday, we heard 
from President Zelenskyy, an historic 
address that moved us all. He spoke in 
an hour of peril for democracy in his 
country and at a turning point for de-
mocracy around the world. 
We were, and remain, awed by the 
courage mirrored by that individual 
who leads Ukraine, and of the people he 
leads who, in light of an overwhelming 
force, said no, we will not yield. We 
will stand, and we will fight, and we 
will speak out for our country. 
Contrary to the premise of the war 
criminal who leads Russia saying that 
they would welcome the Russian troops 
with open arms. That was a lie, a lie to 
the Russian people, a lie to the Russian 
conscripts, and a lie to the world. 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
criminal 
and 
unprovoked invasion of the sovereign 
nation of Ukraine has only grown more 
brutal, Madam Speaker, through the 
days and weeks. We have seen his 
forces target civilian areas, bomb hos-
pitals, and disappear Ukrainian elected 
officials in areas they occupy. 
This House is being asked today 
whether to repeal Russia’s permanent, 
normal trade relations status. The 
question ought to be: Is Russia behav-
ing like a normal, law-abiding nation? 
And of course, the resounding answer 
of the world has been no. 
Indeed, 
there 
is 
nothing 
normal 
about its behavior or about Putin’s 
choices. He has violated every norm 
that has been in place since the end of 
the Second World War. He is testing 
the resolve of the democratic free 
world. And thankfully, we are meeting 
that test with unity, with resolve, and 
with strength. 
The revocation of Russia’s normal 
trade status with the United States, as 
well as that of its ally, Belarus, is just 
the latest tool, Madam Speaker, being 
employed to isolate Russia economi-
cally and prevent the replenishment of 
its military assets being depleted in 
the invasion of Ukraine. 
Putin clearly should have envisioned 
the pain that his invasion would be 
bringing down on his own country. 
That is a shame, because it is clear 
that a large segment of the Russian 
people do not want this war and, in 
fact, thousands of them are in jail be-
cause they have publicly made that 
clear. 
They don’t want to see their children 
being sent off to kill, maim, and ter-
rorize the people of a friendly neighbor 
that caused them no threat; whose citi-
zens maintain close people-to-people 
relations with the Russian people; and 
they do not want to lose access to the 
global marketplaces in which many 
Russian entrepreneurs and innovators 
have been participating and finding op-
portunities. 
But no, the murderer of Moscow de-
termined that he wanted to see the 
Russian empire restored, not because 
he was threatened, not because Russia 
was threatened, but because it would 
serve his ego and concept of empire. 
b 1445 
As Russia continues to grow more 
and more isolated, as the vise tightens 
around its media, as the last few flick-
ers of freedom for its people are extin-
guished, its people need only look to 
the Kremlin for answers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Vote ‘‘yes’’ for 
the heroic people of Ukraine. Vote 
‘‘yes’’ for a leader that has shown us 
courage and commitment to freedom 
and to democracy. Vote ‘‘yes’’ to tell 
Vladimir Putin that norms still mat-
ter, and we will not stand by as he 
seeks to break them. 
No, normal relations are not war-
ranted. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ Vote for democracy. 
Vote for freedom. Vote for a coura-
geous people. Vote for a free Ukraine. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, as the Bible tells us, 
to whom much is given, much is re-
quired. Every American hearing and 
watching President Zelenskyy yester-
day had to understand so much more is 
required of us to end this war in 
Ukraine and to aid the Ukrainian peo-
ple in their victory over Russia. 
This bill takes an important step to 
defund American revenue that would 
fund the Russian war machine. It takes 
an important bipartisan step forward 
to make sure that Russian products 
don’t enter into the U.S. with the same 
treatment as the invaded country, as 
Ukraine’s 
products 
come 
into 
the 
United States. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
worked with Chairman NEAL, our Dem-
ocrat colleagues, and the House and 
Senate on this measure. I know more 
must be done to provide lethal aid to 
Ukraine to continue to expand and 
strengthen 
economic 
sanctions; 
to 
bring our allies together; to make sure, 
in my view, that America takes the 
necessary steps to replace Russian oil 
with the cleanest made-in-America en-
ergy, oil, and gas here in the United 
States as well. 
But 
as 
Congresswoman 
VICTORIA 
SPARTZ, a Ukrainian-born Member of 
Congress, said, this step today is cru-
cial in our defense of Ukraine, the 
Ukrainian people, and democracy in 
the world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, as I close, I thank 
Mr. BRADY for his partnership in this 
effort to hold Putin accountable and 
for his support for the Ukrainian peo-
ple. 
I also was moved by the gentlewoman 
from Indiana’s testimony just a few 
minutes ago about Ukraine when she 
said this is not normal behavior. This 
is not the regularization, we hope, of 
normal behavior, a return to the old 
Soviet empire. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the ter-
rific work of the Committee on Ways 
and Means Trade Subcommittee staff, 
particularly 
Alexandra 
Whittaker, 
Katie White, and Sofia Ferber. Their 
expertise and dedication made this leg-
islation possible, and I thank them for 
their contributions. 
Madam Speaker, I think in the many 
years that I have been in this House, 
one of the most moving moments oc-
curred yesterday when we heard the 
President of Ukraine, Zelenskyy—duly 
elected, incidentally—talk about the 
pain and anguish but also the courage 
of the Ukrainian people. To witness the 
bombardment and the murder and kill-
ing of innocent children by this Rus-
sian dictator, I hope all the world, like 
this Congress today, will abhor that. 
Madam Speaker, it is not enough just 
to applaud and to talk about the chal-
lenges that Russia has presented to the 
civilized world. We have to do some-
thing about it. 
Coming on the heels of the oil embar-
go, I believe this will also receive broad 
bipartisan support today, and it will 
swiftly move from Congress to Presi-
dent Biden’s desk. There is no time to 
waste.

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-
BRANCE OF HONORABLE VICTOR 
FAZIO, JR. 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I think 
that Members now know that yester-
day we lost a wonderful, decent, ex-
traordinary former Member of this 
body. Madam Speaker, as you know, he 
was from your State. His name was Vic 
Fazio. Some of you served with him. 
Most of you did not. He retired in 1998 
from a very successful career. 
Many of us in this House, who served 
with him and who remember him fond-
ly, are grieving the loss of Vic Fazio. 
He was, until my dear friend BEN 
CARDIN came to the Congress, my best 
friend. They were two of my best 
friends. Vic and I were very, very close. 
Many others in the Congress of the 
United States would say the same 
thing, who served with him, that they 
were close to him. 
Vic Fazio had an extraordinarily suc-
cessful life. He was 79 years of age. 
He was a leader and was a cardinal in 
the Appropriations Committee from his 
first year on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. He and an extraordinary Re-
publican, who died just 8 months ago, 
who we remembered on this floor, an-
other dear friend of mine, Jerry Lewis, 
also from California, co-chaired the 
Legislative 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee of the Appropriations Com-
mittee. They did so in a way that en-
hanced the sense of importance of this 
institution and of the collegiality that 
was possible in this institution. We 
said that when Jerry Lewis died. It is 
true when his partner now of that era 
has passed away. 
It is an era that we ought to remem-
ber and hopefully replicate. Vic Fazio 
was a ‘‘Member’s Member.’’ He was an

institutionalist. He cared about each 
and every one of us, irrespective of the 
letter next to our name. He cared 
about process. He cared about sub-
stance. He cared about the integrity of 
Members. He cared about their well- 
being and how they were treated as 
Members. 
In fact, it was Vic Fazio in 1989 who 
led the effort to reform the pay and 
benefits of Members. In that process, at 
that point in time, Members could 
make about $25,000 to $30,000 in what 
was called honoraria. It was a payment 
from private sector interests to Mem-
bers for giving a speech. 
Vic, and the colleagues with whom he 
worked, worked together to eliminate 
honoraria and to make sure, however, 
that Members could live decently in 
this town, an expensive town in which 
to live, with a salary that was appro-
priate. All of you who get your pay-
checks can thank Vic Fazio that they 
are substantially above what they oth-
erwise would have been, but for his and 
other reformers’ actions. 
Vic Fazio lost his wife, Judy, and I 
lost my wife, Judy. Our wives knew one 
another. I lost mine 25 years ago, and 
he lost his some years ago. The sadness 
of his life is that he lost a daughter 
very early in life, and he never got over 
that. It was a deep, deep scar in his 
heart. 
The good news is that after the death 
of Judy, he married a woman whose 
name is Kathy. I don’t know whether 
Kathy is watching today, but if she is, 
we send her our love and our sympathy 
and our thanks for the life of Vic Fazio 
and the contribution he made to his 
country, to his State, to our Nation, 
and to this institution. 
To give us an example of wisdom, of 
acceptance of others, of lifting others 
up, irrespective of that small letter 
next to their name, because he knew 
that all of us were Americans, chosen 
by our neighbors, which is the only 
way you can get here, to serve them, to 
represent their views in this body, and 
to make weighty decisions on their be-
half that will have consequences for 
them and, as we do today, con-
sequences for all the world. 
For 20 years, Vic Fazio was the voice 
of Sacramento and Yolo County in the 
Congress. One of Vic’s lasting legacies 
was the designation of 3,700 acres of 
protected wetlands in Yolo County. 
Perhaps, Madam Speaker, we can name 
that territory after Vic Fazio. 
He was effective because he reached 
across the aisle and worked closely 
with Republicans and, as I mentioned, 
Jerry Lewis. 
When the legislative appropriation 
bill came to the floor, we were all 
proud, because it was not a partisan 
bill. It was a bill for the institution 
and for the people. 
So we remember a man of intellect, 
of integrity, and a warm and genial na-
ture who was proud of his service, 
proud of the Congress, and proud of his 
colleagues. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask all of us 
to rise for a moment of silence to re-
member a great, great American and 
great Member of this House, Vic Fazio. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the Honorable Victor 
Fazio, Jr.

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, on roll 
call No. 77, in the Second Session of the 
117th Congress, on H.R. 6434, I was un-
avoidably detained. Had I been present, 
I would have voted ‘‘aye.’’

LOWERING ENERGY COSTS WITH 
TRANSFORMATIVE INVESTMENTS 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because my constituents, like all 
Americans, are paying far too much at 
the pump. They are angry, and so am I. 
In 
response 
to 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Presi-
dent Biden rightly imposed crippling 
sanctions 
on 
Russia 
to 
bankrupt 
Putin’s war machine and sever Russia’s 
ties to the global war economy. That 
was the right move, and Russia is feel-
ing the punishment from those sanc-
tions. But, unfortunately, so are the 
American people. 
The American people are willing to 
do their part in support of Ukrainians, 
who are fighting for their survival, 
fighting for their independence. But 
the fact is, we are too dependent on 
foreign autocrats for their oil and gas. 
It leaves us vulnerable to supply chain 
constraints and gives tyrants like 
Putin too much power over our way of 
life. 
But with transformative investments 
in clean energy and electric vehicles, 
we could take back control, lower en-
ergy costs, and protect our national se-
curity. 
That is why we need substantial tax 
credits so that all families can afford 
electric vehicles. To power them, we 
must bolster our clean energy produc-
tion from solar wind and other renew-
able sources. 
These investments will shake our re-
liance on fossil fuels, create good-pay-
ing jobs, and shield us from energy 
price shocks like we are feeling right 
now. We simply have no time to waste.

BIDEN’S ENERGY AND INFLATION

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, higher prices 
at the gas pump directly result from 
President Biden’s actions. 
On his first days in office, he can-
celed the Keystone pipeline; he ended 
new oil and gas leases on Federal lands; 
and he is attempting to regulate the 
industry out of existence by way of ex-
ecutive orders. 
But don’t worry, President Biden’s 
administration has offered some words 
of encouragement for Americans strug-
gling to pay outrageous prices at the 
pump. 
Last week, the Secretary of Trans-
portation said to those Americans 
upset about paying outrageous gas 
prices that ‘‘communities can all ben-
efit from the gas savings of driving an 
electric vehicle.’’ 
Did someone forget to mention to the 
Secretary that the average cost of an 
electric vehicle is $50,000, which, frank-
ly, is far more than the yearly house-
hold income of many middle Ten-
nesseans? 
Even Elon Musk, the founder of the 
electric vehicle maker Tesla, under-
stands that electric vehicles cannot 
solve this immediate crisis. Maybe he 
should lead the Department of Trans-
portation. 
Mr. Speaker, there is only one solu-
tion to President Biden’s energy crisis: 
reverse these disastrous executive or-
ders and unleash America’s energy 
independence.

SUPPORT THE BLACK AND BROWN 
MIGRANTS AROUND THE WORLD 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to speak today in support of Black and 
Brown migrants around the world. 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is horrific, 
and my heart is with the millions of 
families who have been displaced and 
those who have lost their lives. 
I must highlight the refugee crisis 
caused by the war that has exposed a 
double standard. Black and Brown mi-
grants fleeing Ukraine are being forced 
to the back of the line and turned away 
at European borders. This reminds me 
of what happened this past September 
at our own border when the U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Patrol used excessive 
force and life-threatening tactics in a 
racially-charged manner against un-
armed Haitians. Simply put, we must 
demand better. 
President Biden and the administra-
tion must raise this issue with Euro-
pean leaders at every opportunity, and 
act to ensure that everyone, regardless 
of their color, their skin, their faith, 
and their ethnicity can find safety 
from this violent conflict. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL RED 
CROSS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
March as National Red Cross Month. 
Since 1943, March has been recognized 
as Red Cross Month. The Red Cross was 
founded by Clara Barton in 1881 with 
the noble mission of preventing and 
easing human suffering. 
Since its creation, the Red Cross has 
grown to one of the largest organiza-
tions in the country. Their efforts span 
from disaster relief, lifesaving blood 
collections, international services, and 
assistance with military families and 
veterans. In our current state of the 
world, the Red Cross is actively assist-
ing 
with 
humanitarian 
efforts 
in 
Ukraine. 
The Red Cross is able to carry out 
their mission because of their vast and 
strong network of volunteers, donors, 
and partners. Whether help is needed in 
big cities or the smallest towns, the 
Red Cross is always ready to provide 
assistance. 
Mr. Speaker, during American Red 
Cross Month, let’s renew our commit-
ment to the timeless ideals of caring 
for one another. 
f 
STOP THE WAR IN UKRAINE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
earlier today during the debate dealing 
with removing the normal trade rela-
tions from Russia and Belarus, I indi-
cated that ‘‘slaughter’’ is too nice a 
word to describe the actions of Vladi-
mir Putin against the innocent people 
of Ukraine. I insist on that definition. 
One Member rose and said it was geno-
cide. Certainly, it is near that dev-
astating and deadly system that we 
have seen used elsewhere. 
As Russian soldiers come home in 
body bags and as Russian mothers 
begin to mourn, I make this plea to the 
Russian people: This is an illegal war. 
Putin is a war criminal. We can only 
now count on you. The Western world 
has done every single thing that they 
can do to stop the pillage, the violence, 
the killing of pregnant women, the 
slaughtering of babies in the street. 
It is time now for the Russian people 
to unleash the shackles around your 
mind and your hands, to be able to 
stand up and say to Putin—who is now 
leading your country into an end that 
you will never, never, never forget or 
be forgiven for. 
Why don’t you stand up and speak 
eloquently to stop this violence and 
this war, to ask for peace, to get to the 
peace table, and make a difference in 
Russia saving lives, and for the people 
of Ukraine. 
GAS PRICES HIT AN ALL-TIME 
HIGH 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, gas prices 
have hit an all-time high, averaging 
over $4 nationally for the first time 
since 2008. The rising price of fuel, gro-
ceries, and just about everything are 
an assault on the pocketbooks of work-
ing families, and it is all a direct result 
of President Biden’s failed energy poli-
cies. 
Under the Trump administration we 
were energy independent for the first 
time in my lifetime. But within just 
his first few days in office, President 
Biden reversed all the progress that we 
made. 
Yesterday, we heard from President 
Zelenskyy who urged President Biden 
to do more to support Ukraine as they 
defend themselves from Russia. While 
banning Russian oil imports is a vital 
first step, another way to support 
Ukraine is by unleashing American en-
ergy so we can help make the world 
less reliant on Putin and dictators who 
use the profits from oil exports to fund 
their malign activities. 
President Biden would rather pay 
dictators than Americans all in the 
name of climate change. What hap-
pened to Made in America? For the 
sake of our Nation and our European 
allies who could use an alternative to 
Russian fuel, I hope he listens to the 
American people—let’s make America 
energy independent again.

REMEMBERING JARED LLOYD 
(Mr. JONES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, March 23 
marks 1 year since the tragic passing 
of my constituent, Jared Lloyd, whose 
memory I wish to honor today. 
Mr. Lloyd was a volunteer firefighter 
with the Hillcrest Fire Department in 
the village of Spring Valley, New York, 
where I grew up. On March 23 of last 
year, Jared Lloyd died a hero. He sac-
rificed his life to rescue residents of 
Evergreen Court Home for Adults from 
a horrific fire. 
Jared’s colleagues have said that he 
saved as many as 30 lives that day. I 
know that I speak on behalf of the peo-
ple of Rockland County when I say 
that I cannot express how incredibly 
proud I am of him for his bravery and 
his selflessness, and how sad I am over 
his loss. 
Jared Lloyd was 35 years old. He was 
a son, a companion, and a loving father 
of two wonderful children, Logan and 
Darius. Jared was a schoolmate of 
mine. He was a graduate of Spring Val-
ley High School. He had so much life 
left to live. He will never be forgotten. 
Today, he is remembered in the House 
of Representatives for his heroic ac-
tions.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Under the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. STANSBURY). 
Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this evening as the proud daughter of 
New Mexico to discuss the trans-
formative impacts of the American 
Rescue Plan for our State on this beau-
tiful St. Patrick’s Day during Women’s 
History Month to highlight the im-
pacts the American Rescue Plan has 
had for our working families, our kids, 
and for our entire Nation. 
It has been a difficult year—a dif-
ficult several years—as our commu-
nities have experienced the impacts of 
the pandemic and the economic strug-
gles that have come with it. When we 
think back to even a year ago, last 
year at this time, we were unable to 
gather safely, unemployment was at an 
all-time high, so many of our families 
were struggling, and businesses closed. 
One year ago, this body passed the 
American Rescue Plan. One year later, 
people are still struggling in our coun-
try, and supply chains and our econ-
omy are still recovering, but so much 
has changed. Our economy is growing 
at a faster rate than at any point since 
the 1980s. More jobs have been created 
in 1 year than ever in our Nation’s his-
tory. Wages are up and more small 
businesses are opening up across the 
country than ever before. 
Because the American Rescue Plan 
changed the way in which families put 
food on the table, provide for their 
families so that our parents, and 
women in particular, can return to 
work and has helped our schools stay 
open and our families and small busi-
nesses stay afloat. 
Let’s get to the heart of the matter 
today, which is how this particular 
piece of legislation has transformed 
the lives of so many New Mexicans and 
how our communities have benefitted 
from these historic policies. 
The people of New Mexico, especially 
our women, are strong, resilient cen-
ters of our families, and the roots of 
our communities. Our women carry us, 
nurture us, and work hard every day so 
that we can succeed—like the women 
in my own life, my own mother, my 
sister, and the trailblazing women who 
came before us and support us every 
day in our communities. 
But the challenges and burdens of 
this pandemic in the past 2 years have 
fallen unequally and disproportion-
ately on women who have exited the 
workforce in unprecedented numbers, 
and on our kids who are resilient, yet 
still struggling. 
As families struggle to make ends 
meet, keep a roof over their heads, and 
put food on the table, women have had 
to dig deep and find creative solutions. 
These burdens have fallen dispropor-
tionately, in particular, on our Latina 
and Hispano women, on our indigenous 
women, our Black women, and women 
struggling economically every day to 
make ends meet. 
There are countless stories of strug-
gle and resilience and survival in our 
communities and the impacts of the 
American Rescue Plan. One from New 
Mexico’s First Congressional District 
is that of April Trujillo and her four 
boys in Albuquerque. 
After losing her husband in Sep-
tember of 2020, Derrick Trujillo, a 
small business owner, who owned a 
small carpet cleaning business, their 
family struggled in a way that they 
had never done so before. They were ul-
timately able to keep a roof over their 
heads and keep food on the table be-
cause of the transformative impacts of 
the child tax credit and rental assist-
ance programs provided by the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. 
It is by no means a stretch to say 
that these programs helped to catch 
this family as they faced potentially 
becoming homeless at one of the most 
difficult moments in their life. That is 
exactly what this American Rescue 
Plan was designed to do and why we 
must put these transformational in-
vestments in childcare, in the child tax 
credit, in housing, in food assistance, 
and our community well-being, and 
continue them into the future. 
They catch families like the Trujillo 
family when they need it most. It will 
help to lift up Americans who are fac-
ing economic struggles and create op-
portunities for families for generations 
to come. 
As we celebrate the 1-year anniver-
sary of the American Rescue Plan and 
celebrate the passage of the historic in-
frastructure package a few months ago, 
and crucial budget legislation just this 
last week, these bills have had a trans-
formational impact on our economy, 
on jobs, and families across the coun-
try, and we acknowledge that the work 
is not over. 
We must extend the child tax credit. 
We must expand programs to tackle 
housing and hunger. We must invest in 
a universal childcare system and car-
ing for our elders. We must tackle 
drought and climate change. We must 
stand with Ukraine and global democ-
racy. This is the work ahead and we 
stand together united to get it done. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I have been taught and told 
from an African proverb that when a 
tall tree falls in the forest it makes a 
lot of noise, it gathers a lot of atten-
tion, everybody and every entity in the 
forest knows that something has hap-
pened. 
A few days ago, a tall tree fell in the 
‘‘Chicagoland’’ 
community 
where 
I 
live. A gentleman, Mr. Pervis Spann, 
spent the last day of his life. Pervis 
Spann, to all of us, is known as the 
‘‘blues man’’ because he was a great 
artist who projected, promoted, and en-
tertained us for years. 
b 1700 
Pervis was born in Itta Bena, Mis-
sissippi. Like many other African 
Americans who were born in Itta Bena, 
Mississippi, and anyone else in Mis-
sissippi, individuals migrated to other 
places. Thousands and thousands and 
thousands of them made their way to 
Chicago, Illinois. 
As a matter of fact, we fondly say 
that the only place where there are 
more Mississippians than there are in 
Chicago is in Mississippi itself. Many 
individuals left the delta area. So did 
Pervis Spann. He went to Michigan; 
worked in Gary, Indiana; and joined 
the military. But eventually he made 
his way to Chicago. 
He came to Chicago and used his GI 
Bill to go to broadcasting school, and 
he got to be very good at it, not only as 
a broadcaster but also as a promoter. 
Ultimately, 
the 
Stack 
brothers 
bought a radio station, and they named 
that station WVON. Eventually Mr. 
Pervis Spann, Vernon Jarrett, Wesley 
South and a woman named Gwendolyn 
Hayes ended up acquiring the station. 
Spann was the blues part of it. As a 
matter of fact, he entertained and pro-
moted, entertained and promoted. 
The station also became a pioneer in 
talk radio. As a matter of fact, before 
there was talk radio, Wesley South, 
one of the partners, had a talk radio 
program called ‘‘On Target’’. And this 
was years and years and years ago. ‘‘On 
Target’’. It is hard to believe that talk 
now dominates in many places. So 
WVON was a pioneer of talk radio. 
It also has become the powerhouse of 
communication 
in 
the 
Chicagoland 
area, especially for African Americans. 
Talk all day long about whatever is 
going on in the community, whatever 
is going on in Chicago, and whatever is 
going on in the world, WVON. As a 
matter of fact, many of my neighbors 
and friends wait to wake up in the 
morning so that they can listen to 
WVON especially, beginning at 6:00 
o’clock in the morning. 
But not only was Pervis Spann a tre-
mendous promoter, but he also was a 
tremendous businessman period. Ulti-
mately the station came into the hands 
of his daughter, Melody Spann-Cooper, 
who has taken it to new heights. If it is 
not heard on VON, it did not happen if 
it was not part of the discussion on 
WVON. So it is much more than enter-
tainment. It is the community’s town-
hall all day long, every day, whatever 
it is, WVON leads the way. 
So I simply wanted to express condo-
lences to his family on his passing and 
also let his family know how much 
Pervis Spann has meant to Chicago, 
how much it has meant to the social-
ization of the community, how much it 
has meant to the business promotion of 
the community, and how much it has 
meant to the spirituality of the com-
munity. On Sunday afternoons there is 
kind of a gospel-political atmosphere 
created, so that some people can hardly 
wait to get home from church so they 
can turn on VON so they can listen to

the ‘‘Gospel with Pam Morris Walton’’ 
show. 
So 
Pervis 
may 
have 
been 
the 
bluesman, and he may have enter-
tained all the greats. Pervis Spann was 
noted and known as the person who 
named Aretha Franklin the ‘‘Queen of 
Soul’’. He gave her that designation, 
and it stuck. So Melody will carry on 
in the tradition of her father as VON is 
the voice not just of the Negro—that 
was what the VON stood for—but the 
voice of the Nation, WVON, Pervis 
Spann. 
Of course, Mr. Speaker, this month is 
Women’s History Month, and we cele-
brate Women’s History Month because 
of the tremendous progress that has 
been made. 
I am always reminded that when a 
group of men sat in the room and stat-
ed that we hold these truths to be self- 
evident, that all men are created equal, 
they didn’t really mean all men. They 
meant some men. They meant the men 
whom they felt had enough knowledge, 
enough resources, and enough interests 
to make decisions for the country. 
Therefore, all men were not in the 
room. 
As a matter of fact, African-Amer-
ican men who were in slave States were 
not even considered as a full man. Afri-
can-American slaves were considered 
as three-fifths. They had something 
called 
the 
three-fifths 
compromise 
which meant that they would only 
count 
African-American 
slaves 
as 
three-fifths of a person when they were 
counting up for the Census, not all men 
and no women. 
As a matter of fact, women didn’t get 
the right to vote in this country until 
a little more than 100 years ago. Yet, 
as a result of suffrage, protests, strug-
gle, and changes, now a woman is the 
Vice President of the United States. So 
there has been movement, although 
not nearly enough and not nearly what 
there has to be. So the struggle will 
continue so that ultimately there will 
be levels of equity in this country for 
women, Blacks, and other citizens who 
don’t have it and have not had it. 
The woman that I chose to mention 
at this time is a woman, Merri Dee, 
who was an icon in broadcasting and 
philanthropy. Merri Dee was born in 
Chicago in 1936, the youngest of six 
children. She was only 2 years old when 
her mother died. Her father ultimately 
became sick and, of course, he had re-
married. She was adopted by her step-
mother, and she maintained that life 
was pretty rough for her until she got 
to the fifth grade and met a wonderful 
teacher who helped to change her life. 
She stated in an interview that this 
teacher, a Mrs. Robinson, told her that 
she would be great. She believed in 
that teacher, and then she went on and 
became great. 
She graduated from Englewood High 
School, went back to New Orleans and 
enrolled in Xavier University where 
she studied business administration. 
She, of course, dropped out and took a 
job at IBM to help her other brothers 
and sisters. She then worked, got mar-
ried, got divorced, had a daughter, got 
a good job, and she just felt that she 
was spending too much time away at 
her job and from her child, so she quit 
that job, and somebody told her: You 
have a gift for gab. 
She decided to study broadcasting 
and journalism. 
She did, and she got so good at it, 
eventually she got her first show, a 
radio show. She did that for a bit, and 
then she got a television show, became 
excellent at it, and became one of the 
top female broadcasters in the United 
States. 
As a matter of fact, she was so good, 
she did that, then she ran into a little 
difficulty. She and one of her guests 
were 
kidnapped 
leaving 
the 
show, 
robbed, shot, left for dead, and with 
two bullets in her head she crawled up 
to the highway where someone picked 
her up, took her to the hospital, and 
she stayed hospitalized for a year. 
As a matter of fact, she was told that 
she wouldn’t make it and had two last 
rites given to her, one by the Reverend 
Jesse Jackson who was indeed a friend 
of hers. But she prevailed and lived and 
was in the hospital for a year. She 
came back, got hired by WGN Tele-
vision, and she became an anchor. She 
did that for 11 years. Then they asked 
her to take the job as director of com-
munity relations and public affairs and 
their children’s charities, and she did. 
She generated $31 million for the 
charities and for the philanthropic 
work. She just kept doing it. I have 
never known anybody who was more 
open and more giving. I must have 
gone to at least hundreds of charitable 
events over the years where Merri Dee 
was 
the 
announcer. 
She 
was 
the 
facilitator. She was the person making 
it happen. 
So when we design and define what 
greatness is, Merri Dee was obviously a 
great woman, a great broadcaster, a 
tremendous communicator, and a per-
son who could stir audiences and 
groups and convince people to give 
thousands of dollars for needy causes. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I salute Merri Dee. 
I salute her, and I revere her. I know 
that if people go up that way, that she 
is up there walking among the angels 
and putting on events and activities 
and waiting for other people to come.

REMEMBERING HAROLD WASHINGTON 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, finally, I will mention, al-
though it is Women’s History Month, I 
will mention now an African-American 
male who was a transformative figure 
in the life, especially of a big city that 
was the third largest city in the United 
States of America, a gentleman named 
Harold Washington, who became the 
first African-American mayor of the 
city of Chicago. 
Harold, if he was alive now, would be 
celebrating his 100th birthday. He 
would be 100 years old. 
Harold was a transformative figure in 
the political life of Chicago. Chicago 
was known as the city of the big shoul-
ders, known as many things. But it was 
a 
patronage-laden 
city. 
Patronage 
guided the politics of Chicago. 
For a long time, it had a tradition 
that if somebody went to city hall or 
to State government or county govern-
ment to get a job, the saying was: 
‘‘Don’t bring nobody, didn’t nobody see 
it,’’ basically meaning that unless you 
had a letter from a ward boss or from 
some elected official who was part of 
the system, even if it was a job that 
you had ten times the qualifications 
for, you wouldn’t get it. You wouldn’t 
get it because you didn’t have the 
hook-up; you didn’t have the connec-
tion. 
We actually convinced Harold Wash-
ington, I am sure, to run for mayor. He 
had become a Member of Congress. He 
had been the Democratic lead on the 
voting rights bill. Of course, in the mid 
‘60s and ‘70s, that was still hot, just as 
it is hot today. 
It is amazing that we can’t get the 
voting rights extension granted, espe-
cially when all politicians in this coun-
try basically suggest that they believe 
in democracy, that they believe in 
democratic principles, and that they 
believe that everybody should have a 
right to participate and express them-
selves. Then we go through this process 
of wrangling to make it happen. 
But somehow or another, there seems 
to be a block. I don’t know; maybe peo-
ple have changed their minds from 
what they learned in grammar school 
or in high school or what they read in 
the Constitution and all of that. It 
seems that way. 
Nevertheless, Harold Washington was 
convinced by people like Lou Palmer, 
people like Vernon Jarrett, people like 
myself and others, to run for the 
mayor of the city of Chicago. He said: 
Well, if you guys really want me to run 
for mayor, you have got to show it. If 
you don’t show it, I won’t do it. You 
have got to get some people registered 
to vote, and you have got to raise some 
money. 
I remember sitting in a room in Lou 
Palmer’s 
basement, 
eating 
water-
melon, as a matter of fact, about 10 or 
12 of us. We then said to Harold Wash-
ington: Well, Harold, you can go on to 
your next meeting. And we set out to 
generate the conditions and meet the 
conditions that he had set. 
Harold was so astute, such a charm-
er, such an intellectual, but he also 
liked to walk the streets and talk to 
people in the alley and talk to people 
who other people probably wouldn’t. 
I never will forget that I had set up a 
meeting with a bunch of motorcycle 
riders for Harold to go to, and some of 
his campaign people didn’t want him to 
come. Motorcycle riders, the Born Los-
ers, the Buzzing Bees, and Dragons. 
Harold said: I will be there. Of course, 
he came, and everybody had donned 
their leather jackets and all those 
things. 
After he got elected, we ended up 
with some plaques that the motorcycle

riders gave to Harold and to me. I don’t 
know what happened to his. Mine is 
still around. 
But when Harold got elected, the city 
council organized against him. There 
were 29 people on the other side and 21 
of us. We called it the 29–21. Ulti-
mately, we ended up with a 25–25 split. 
Every item that came up, there would 
be 25 votes for it and 25 votes against 
it. Then, of course, Harold would get a 
chance to break the tie. 
He had such a sense of fairness that 
he went all over the city assuring 
every community that they would be 
treated the same as every other com-
munity, that they would get a part of 
the infrastructure money, that their 
schools would be prepared, and that 
their sidewalks would be repaired and 
fixed. 
He became bigger than life. As a mat-
ter of fact, when Harold died, people 
celebrated in the streets and spent 
days walking through to pay reverence. 
That is because he helped people under-
stand that government belonged to 
them, and they did not necessarily be-
long to government. 
When people ask what was the trans-
formation, 
the 
transformation 
was 
that the patronage system was seri-
ously diminished. The transformation 
was 
the 
greatest 
participation, 
in 
terms of turnout in elections, would 
occur, because the people felt that they 
had somebody in the highest office who 
respected and recognized what they 
had to say. 
Harold would stop on the street and 
have a townhall, and 15, 20 people 
would gather around. It wasn’t his in-
tent to stop on the street. He just 
stopped and would spend time. 
Someone asked me what was one of 
my fondest memories or stories about 
Harold Washington. I told them it was 
the fact that I drove a car for 19 years. 
In 19 years, the car had sort of rusted 
in the floor, and I put a plank there. 
We were someplace and Harold wanted 
a ride to tell me something or ask me 
something, so he told his guys to go 
ahead and he was going to ride to the 
next stop with me. When he got in the 
car, the plank had shifted. He looked 
down and said: ‘‘What the . . . ’’ 
I said: ‘‘Mr. Mayor, don’t worry about 
that. Just push that plank back over, 
and you won’t even know that there is 
no floor.’’ 
He said: ‘‘Why don’t you buy yourself 
a car?’’ Well, I didn’t get one right 
then. Eventually, I did. 
Harold Washington transformed the 
politics of Chicago. Harold Washington 
gave being an elected official in Chi-
cago a new meaning, that it was not 
just about glad handing and backslap-
ping. It was about trying to serve and 
serving the people. 
Harold, you did your job, you did it 
well, and we pray tribute to you even 
during Women’s History Month. 
RECOGNIZING CHICAGO’S UKRAINIAN VILLAGE 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, as I prepare to close, I can’t 
help but be reminded that I represent a 
community in Chicago that we fondly 
call Ukrainian Village. That is because 
most of the people there are of Ukrain-
ian heritage. 
We have a rally every week. We have 
everything that you can possibly have, 
with the hope and with the faith that 
our President, that our country, will 
stay on the course. We have no doubt 
that 
we 
will 
continue 
to 
protect 
Ukraine as a part of the humanity that 
this country, ‘‘My Country, ‘Tis of 
Thee,’’ needs to express, because we 
know that so goes Ukraine, so goes the 
other 
countries 
nearby, 
and, 
ulti-
mately, so will go the United States of 
America. 
Ukraine is a part of us. We are a part 
of Ukraine. Together, I think we will 
beat back the murderous, cowardly 
pact. We will be pressed to the wall, 
but always, as Claude McKay would 
say, always, always fighting back. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
WHAT GOOD HAS BEEN DONE IN 
THE LAST YEAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Under the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to apologize right now, because I 
have had a lot of coffee, and I am just 
cranky today. I am just cranky. I also 
apologize for those who have to try to 
keep track. I will, on occasion, try to 
slow down. I torment them on occasion 
by talking too fast. 
I started to do part of this a week 
ago and only wanted to do a little part, 
but we have a 10 o’clock shutdown rule, 
so I got up against the clock and had to 
stop. So, God forbid, they let me have 
the entire hour, which means I brought 
a whole bunch of boards. 
A week ago, I pitched to some of our 
friends here a really mean, difficult, 
and absolutely honest question: Tell 
me something good that has been done 
in the last year of absolute control of 
Congress, of the White House, and of, 
functionally, the levers of our Govern-
ment. Tell us something good that has 
been done policy-wise, legislative-wise, 
that has passed here for working men 
and women, for the future of my 6- 
year-old daughter, for people’s retire-
ment security, what has actually hap-
pened here. 
Then I am going to walk through a 
whole bunch of things where the words, 
the virtue signaling, the discussion had 
great language, warm and fuzzy and 
caring, and it has actually been dev-
astating to poor people, to the working 
poor. 
I don’t think they meant to, but the 
fact of the matter is, at some point, my 
brothers and sisters on the left have to 
have a brutally honest conversation 
with themselves of what their policies 
are doing. 
We are going to start with, being 
from a border State, immigration. But 
it is not immigration. It is opening up 
the border. What has the Democrats’ 
policy, what has this President’s pol-
icy, on functionally ignoring the bor-
der, done to my community in Arizona 
and to the country. 
b 1730 
First, let’s also get our heads around 
the scale of the numbers when you 
start seeing that border encounters in-
creased 278 percent, functionally, in a 
year, when you start seeing numbers 
over 1.7 million crossings, when you 
start seeing crossings that are in the 
millions. 
But 
do 
you 
remember 
all 
the 
speechifying that was here a year ago? 
Do you remember how mean the last 
President was? We are going to be com-
passionate and loving. 
Does anyone here understand the 
economic concept of first degree, sec-
ond degree, third degree effects, what 
you have done to my communities in 
Phoenix, what you have done to the 
communities in this country? Let’s 
show the actual math. 
Now, 
I 
also 
have 
an 
economic 
premise, and we have done this presen-
tation multiple times. They were writ-
ten by liberal economists that talked 
about the two things you do to make 
the working poor poorer. 
Number one was inflation. Well, con-
gratulations. We are going to talk 
about that. 
Number two was open borders, and it 
was a very simple concept. If you look 
at the profile of our brothers and sis-
ters who we would categorize—and I 
hate these categories, but we do them 
for policy purposes—who are consid-
ered the working poor, they are often 
our brothers and sisters who did not 
graduate high school, who sell their 
labor. That is their income. 
You open up the border and import 
millions of individuals who their eco-
nomic contribution will be to sell their 
labor. One of these economic papers, 
written a decade ago, says you have 
just taken the working poor in the 
country and made them poor for an-
other decade. One of them talks about 
that their income, at the end of the 
decade, will be at least 6 percent lower. 
For all those folks that like to 
preach about compassion, where is the 
compassion for those who are just 
grinding it out, trying to survive here? 
Do you understand that, at some point, 
the math always wins? 
Let’s have a little fun here. Here is 
my premise, and I am going to try to 
do this on a number of these boards. 
You open up the border. We are going 
to talk about how many of our brothers 
and sisters and families and the kids in 
my community and across this country 
are now dying of fentanyl. 
I did a ride-along a month ago with 
one of my neighbors who happens to be 
a police sergeant in a portion of north 
central Phoenix. He is telling me that, 
a year ago—and I am not going to get

these numbers exactly right. It was 
like $70 to $100 for that addict to get 
high, and now it might be $12. 
Remember 
your 
basic 
economics 
classes. When a price crashes, what 
does that mean? The availability has 
skyrocketed. 
We are also going to talk a little bit 
about—I have ZIP Codes in my commu-
nity where the social workers, the 
charities, some of my churches are 
telling me homelessness has doubled in 
1 year. Have you seen the crime num-
bers? We have to deal with reality. 
Then, we probably should have an in-
teresting conversation. What makes 
poor communities poorer? If you have 
made drugs available, if you have 
flooded the communities with home-
lessness, if now you have also increased 
crime—and do you see the death num-
bers of our brothers and sisters who are 
dying of drugs? 
Are we willing to have a basic under-
standing—when you make a really 
crappy decision that we are not going 
to enforce the border because it is more 
compassionate, do you understand the 
cascade of misery that the left has 
brought to many of their own constitu-
encies? 
The fact of the matter is, a lot of 
these neighborhoods that are suffering 
this aren’t the ones voting for me. But, 
dammit, I care because their misery 
should be all of ours, except it is not 
politically expedient around here be-
cause it basically proves the rhetoric: 
Let’s defund the police. Let’s defund 
ICE. 
Great job, guys. Look what you did 
to your neighborhoods. Look what you 
did to our communities. Look at the 
misery. Look at the death you brought. 
And the math will always win. 
For every Member and staffer who 
may be on one of the televisions 
around this campus, if you are watch-
ing, I want you to have the experience 
I have had where you have to pick up 
the phone and talk to a mother who 
had 
their 
child 
die 
because 
they 
thought they were taking some party 
drug, and it turned out to have 
fentanyl in it. 
That is the misery. And you are on 
that phone, and the tears are running 
down, and you are terrified. 
I have a 61⁄2-year-old, the greatest 
gift God has ever given me. I am terri-
fied that this is the society that you 
get when you put the left in charge. 
Did they mean this? The rhetoric 
doesn’t say so, but, dammit, will they 
actually stop and take a look at the 
outcome of their decisions? 
When you see a 133 percent increase, 
people in our communities are dying. 
They come behind these microphones 
and tell us how they are the ones that 
care. Fine. Maybe you should be on the 
next phone call with me when you are 
talking to that mother. You can ex-
plain to them that it was compassion 
to open up the border and make it so 
drug prices crash, so now fentanyl 
comes screaming into my community, 
and their child gets to die. 
There are consequences to really bad 
policy. It may have been great rhetoric 
when you had a different President, but 
the misery has been foisted on our 
neighborhoods, our suburbs, our com-
munities, and particularly the commu-
nities that the Democrats claim they 
care about. 
If you look at what is going on, on 
the drug overdoses—by the way, I 
brought this because, believe it or not, 
for anyone watching, there are rules 
where I can’t reach over here and write 
on this, so we did something sort of 
silly. We had to print it and put some 
tape on it. 
There is your number for 2021, and 
that is only as of October. We don’t 
have the final data. So, congratula-
tions, Democrats. Over 100,000 of our 
brothers and sisters are dead, of our 
children, of our next generation. And 
there are still a couple more months to 
be added to that math. 
I don’t believe it is purposeful, but I 
believe there is an embarrassment of 
saying, oh, God, what have we done? 
The number of times around this place 
you make a policy decision, you cam-
paign on it, it is in your brochures, you 
have given speeches, and then you find 
out it crashes and burns and creates 
more misery, that willingness to get up 
behind a microphone and say: I am 
wrong. 
I have had a couple of those, where I 
thought I understood the math. I 
thought I understood the societal im-
plications. I am waiting. 
Now, we did hear a little bit of it. I 
was optimistic. The President got be-
hind that microphone up ahead of me 
and said: Let’s fund the police. 
You could hear the grumbling of a 
number of our brothers and sisters on 
this side because they had campaigned 
on something very different for years. 
Now, let’s talk about other levels of 
crime, and this is not my area of spe-
cialty. I do Medicare finance. I do 
trade. I do taxes. I love working on the 
geeky stuff. Yes, it doesn’t get you on 
television. You don’t raise lots of 
money because you said something 
crazy, but it is important. It is what 
keeps the economy going. It is what 
keeps prosperity, and I believe eco-
nomic growth is moral. 
But we have been working on a side 
project on the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, and here is our outline. What 
makes people poor? 
Well, you get people that say, oh, 
education, racism. You start looking at 
the data sets and truly grinding in, and 
then things we could do something 
about, and you start seeing things that 
pop off the data if you are willing to 
open your eyes and own a calculator. 
Diabetes actually pops off as one of 
the top things when you see the con-
centrations of our brothers and sisters 
with diabetes. 
When you actually see crime—and 
this is one that almost is never talked 
about here. Communities often that 
have the most economic misery, is it a 
chicken and the egg? It is a little hard 
to get ahead in life when people keep 
stealing stuff or killing your family 
members. 
Maybe it is time. Reagan, back in the 
1980 election, had something called the 
misery index. It was, functionally, in-
flation and unemployment. Maybe it is 
time we could do something much 
more effective and create the Biden 
and Democrat-controlled misery index. 
We could just lay out how many of our 
brothers and sisters are OD’ing, how 
many of our brothers and sisters are 
dying, how many of our brothers and 
sisters are victims of crime, how many 
of our brothers and sisters are sicker 
today, how many of our brothers and 
sisters now have mental health issues 
because they spent a couple of years 
locked up, how many of our kids are al-
most afraid to take their masks off 
now. 
Think about the sort of psychodrama 
that this place has foisted on the citi-
zens of this country. And the hits keep 
coming. 
Look, I put this one here more just 
as a—and I know I am being a bit 
snarky, but I have to get it off my 
chest. The number of get-togethers I 
had a year ago, so during 2020, and fuss-
ing and screaming: Why aren’t you 
doing more about COVID? If we had 
Democrats in charge, people would be 
healthier. We would solve the problem. 
Do you remember President Biden’s 
campaign promises? Do you remember 
the Democrat leadership’s promises 
here? Put us in charge. We will take 
care of it. 
So, a time where there are thera-
peutics, a time where there are vac-
cines, you did a great job, guys, a great 
job. Because do you see the math? A 
hell of a lot more of our brothers and 
sisters died in a time where we actu-
ally had the tools. 
What happened? My argument is 
rhetoric sure does sound a lot better 
than actually explaining competence. 
Now, let’s talk about—in my 8 min-
utes I had last week, it was basically 
trying to have a conversation of what 
the Democrats have done making the 
environment worse. And you go, huh? 
The fact of the matter—and I will 
show you the slide here in a moment. 
As soon as the Biden administration 
took over—but it even goes back to 
2018 when the Democrats won the 
House. 
They basically set off a campaign or 
jihad, whatever colloquialism you want 
to use, and it wasn’t, hey, we are just 
going to cancel pipelines. What was it? 
In 2020, President Biden, in a debate 
with BERNIE SANDERS, said there will 
be no more permitting. No more per-
mitting of pipelines. No more permit-
ting of wells. It was an absolute prom-
ise. 
Well, to his credit, he kept his prom-
ise. But did anyone stop for a moment 
to think about what they were going to 
do? 
So, functionally, what is ESG? I can 
give you the quote, or we can just do 
something really simple. It is when you

basically add such a risk premium to 
investing in any type of hydrocarbons. 
So, you are a pension system, you are 
our pension systems, you are the Cali-
fornia teachers, you are a mutual fund, 
you are an index fund, and you are 
going to now have to, with all the 
threats and things coming through the 
administration—this isn’t votes. This 
isn’t a proclamation from the Presi-
dent. This is the infrastructure of our 
society and our financial markets basi-
cally raising a risk premium for invest-
ing in natural gas, for investing in the 
infrastructure of hydrocarbons. Well, 
what happens? 
b 1745 
What happens when you do that? Be-
cause remember, it wasn’t the invasion 
of Ukraine by Russia. Go back to last 
September and October when natural 
gas prices shot off the charts, and there 
were people here coming—people on 
the left—you know, attacking hydro-
carbon and natural gas companies. But 
the fact of the matter is, we were talk-
ing about how miserable this winter 
was going to be, what was happening to 
your fuel prices. 
And look, I have never actually seen 
heating oil. I am from the desert. I 
have lived in the desert my entire life. 
I have seen pictures of it. And then you 
see people saying it is two, three, four 
times more expensive for these people 
to heat their homes, and then you also 
realize the ZIP Codes they live in and 
who they vote for. They voted for it. 
But the reality of it is, there is a 
punch line here. When Democrat policy 
drove up the price of natural gas so 
high that power generation all across 
North America converted back to coal, 
you realize the United States burnt 23 
percent more coal last year. 
I mean, did anyone just do the basic 
math? Okay. You are going to engage 
in policies that make natural gas dra-
matically more expensive. The next 
least expensive fuel, all of a sudden, be-
came coal. Congratulations. 
Now, during President Trump’s time, 
the use of coal—and this was a guy who 
claimed to be a coal supporter—went 
down dramatically because natural gas 
crashed in price. Remember, the last 15 
years, the movement we had to become 
dramatically less carbon-centric, you 
know, greenhouse gas formula, heading 
towards—for those who cared about the 
math on the Paris accords, was almost 
exclusively, exclusively the use of nat-
ural gas because, remember, we took 
off so much baseload nuclear, we took 
off more baseload nuclear in the United 
States in the previous 15 years than we 
actually did produce new photovoltaic 
and wind. So if someone says, oh, it is 
because of all the clean energy genera-
tion. No, it is actually because of nat-
ural gas displacing coal. I mean, the 
math is the math. 
This one we need to share. Anyone 
notice if you were here—and this is 
even for the poor staff here, please 
don’t move your eyes or anything be-
cause someone will take a shot at you 
for it—a couple weeks ago, before the 
State of the Union, we came to the 
floor here, we had to wear masks. Then 
we all hear about polling being done by 
the White House and the Democrat 
leadership, and all of a sudden, we find 
out, hey, turns out the public is over it, 
even Democrat-based voters are pretty 
much over the enforcement of mask 
mandates, and did you notice pretty 
much a little bit after the Impact Re-
search poll that the Democrats did, 48 
hours later after the poll was pub-
lished, guess what happened? I don’t 
have to wear a mask on the floor any-
more. 
Policy by virtue signaling instead of 
a calculator, it is theater. Welcome to 
how this Congress has been run. It hap-
pened. It happened. Look, I am not the 
only one to point this out. Even a num-
ber of leftist publications said: Isn’t it 
just amazing, as soon as the Democrats 
got a poll that it no longer was popular 
even with their base, all the masks 
come off? 
Even the people, even the experience 
of a couple of the Democrat matriarchs 
that fussed at me not to get into an el-
evator with them because I wasn’t 
wearing a mask in the hallway, which 
I was very respectful, I didn’t, 48 hours 
later didn’t care that I was in the ele-
vator with them without a mask be-
cause the polling said it was okay. I am 
happy to know we now make public 
health policy on the Democrat side 
with polling. But it is real. It hap-
pened. 
So let’s actually have a little bit 
more fun here. The absurdity of Demo-
crat policy. Guess when statutorily— 
the Democrats passed this about 3 
weeks ago, they set a date. They set a 
date when the pandemic will be over. 
Not based on science, not based even on 
their polling. They set a date. Con-
gratulations, it is September 30, 2025. 
Two years ago, when we were actu-
ally working together on this, we had a 
collective understanding we were wor-
ried that emergency rooms, hospitals 
were going to be just packed, we 
wouldn’t have enough ventilators, we 
were racing for vaccines. We didn’t 
have antivirals. But there was, I 
thought, a collective societal that we 
declare a pandemic. 
Do you remember 15 days to slow the 
spread? We will all stay home for 15 
days, slow the spread. And here we are 
a 
couple 
years 
later. 
We 
have 
antivirals; we have vaccines; we have 
therapeutics; we understand the virus; 
and the policy set is to make Sep-
tember 30, 2025. 
Now, we should actually let whoever 
is watching know the joke. It is about 
the money. This place is always about 
the money. There are lots and lots and 
lots of special spending line items that 
come with the declaration of a pan-
demic, and this pretty much locks in 
saying, hey, you know, this person may 
hate vaccine passports or hate masks 
or this and that, but wink wink, nod 
nod we have made sure the declaration 
of the pandemic is until 2025 so we can 
keep getting the largesse of the SPIFs 
on the cash. If that is what it is, tell 
the truth. Say, look, you know, we buy 
our elections by handouts through our 
policies here. Okay. But tell the truth. 
I have a personal fixation on diabe-
tes, and I have done speeches, presen-
tation after presentation on this, and I 
want to walk through why. Look, we 
will come back to this two or three 
times. 
This slide, the numbers are much 
higher now because this slide is from a 
year ago because the CBO, Congres-
sional Budget Office, hasn’t given us an 
update. But 29 years from now, we are 
scheduled to have $112 trillion of bor-
rowing, and that is in today’s dollars, 
so adjusted for inflation. Functionally, 
75 percent of that spending is Medicare. 
31 percent of all Medicare spending is 
diabetes. 33 percent of all healthcare 
spending in the United States is dia-
betic related. I represent, I believe, the 
second highest percentage of popu-
lation, one of my Tribal communities 
that I represent—I love them dearly— 
they are number two in, we think the 
world, in the percentage of their mem-
bers who have diabetes, and their sister 
Tribe is number one. 
Come to my community sometime. I 
will take you out in the community, 
introduce you to some of the families I 
have known my whole life, and grand-
ma has her foot cut off. 
So the President did something a lot 
of people cheered for: Hey, insulin is 
outrageously expensive, we are going 
to subsidize it. Okay. Fine. Fine. 
Does anyone on the Democrat side 
actually read any of the healthcare, 
the pharmaceutical, the science jour-
nals? The facility is almost up and run-
ning where it is a co-op. If they actu-
ally cared about crashing the price of 
insulin, someone would have paid at-
tention that it is already here. This 
stuff is about to roll out. 
A number of the pharmacies and hos-
pitals got together and said: Screw 
this, we are going to use a market. We 
are going to go around, and we are 
going to make it ourselves, and we are 
going to do direct sales. They are talk-
ing about no more than $30 per vial, $55 
per box. It is not requiring government 
subsidies, 
regulations, 
because 
you 
know how efficiently that works: We 
will subsidize it, but the cost of the bu-
reaucracy to do it will be a nightmare. 
But does anyone pay attention? I was 
here about 3 weeks ago talking about if 
the left really wants to be compas-
sionate—and I can get my brothers and 
sisters on the right to be loving and 
compassionate—we know how to cure 
type 1, at least that is what the science 
journals are saying. We have figured 
out how to take a stem cell and direct 
it to become—I always mispronounce 
it—an islet cell to produce insulin. 
There is now even a new version where 
the taking of that cell and adjusting it 
with CRISPR so the body doesn’t see it 
as foreign so you can actually have a 
constant line. 
Wouldn’t it be miraculous if you ac-
tually had some thinking people here

that 
said: 
Screw 
this, 
instead 
of 
patching up people’s misery, we are 
going to subsidize insulin so you can 
live in misery, just cheaper? 
And back to my previous comments 
that we have been working on a model 
about what creates income inequality, 
what creates poverty? We are actually 
seeing health and crime and these 
things. Hold it. We know diabetes is ac-
tually for our brothers, the urban poor, 
my Tribal poor, rural poor, is truly ev-
erywhere. If you cared, wouldn’t you 
throw everything you have at this con-
cept of, okay, we know how to cure 
type 1? 
The articles, if you read through 
them—and some of it is thick—is, 
yeah, the same concept, you could take 
someone with type 2 and get their body 
to produce insulin again, but you 
would actually have to have them en-
gage in much healthier life practices. 
Would we be willing to have the really 
brutal conversation here of we are 
going to change how the farm bill 
works, we are going to change how nu-
trition support works, and those who 
would actually like to see a future 
where their diabetes type 2 is cured, 
would they be willing to work with 
their community to eat different? 
Would we be willing to work on that? 
Would we be willing to deliver, have 
Lyft deliver food boxes to the home 
and say we are loving, caring about 
your future and your health, and we 
don’t want you to be like the grandma 
who is a friend of mine who has had her 
foot cut off? And if you will do this, the 
societal trade will be, we will do the 
stem cell to islet cell to get your body 
back to producing insulin. 
And, oh, by the way, diabetes is the 
single biggest contributor to U.S. sov-
ereign debt. So for those who are fiscal 
hawks, great. For those who actually 
give a darn about people, wonderful. 
And, instead, our solution coming 
from our President standing right 
there is: I am going to subsidize insu-
lin. I am not going to cure the misery; 
I am just going to make it cheaper. 
Where’s the vision here? 
So now let’s actually go back to the 
previous, the two things you do most 
to make the working poor poor. Okay. 
We talked about opening the border, 
making them compete with others with 
similar skill sets. My numbers are al-
ready out of date because it keeps get-
ting worse. You also crush them by 
making everything they buy—because 
if you are poor, if you are that working 
middle class, if you are just hard-
working middle class, the amount of 
your income that goes to food, the 
amount of your income that goes to 
rent, the amount of your income that 
goes to driving is substantially more 
than the vast majority of the people in 
this body. 
The income we are paid, we are in the 
top quartile. And then we also have 
some of the richest people you can 
imagine that are here, and it is always 
funny hearing them talk about—when 
they are worth millions and millions 
and millions of dollars, but to the fam-
ily that is struggling out there, this 
has been a really crappy year. 
I will point it out, and I am going to 
do it a couple times. Guess which com-
munity had the highest inflation rate 
in the United States? Mine. I had 10.9 
percent in my neighborhoods. You 
want to talk about kicking people in 
the head? That is year over year. This 
is what unified Democrat government 
has brought you. You are poorer today 
than the day Joe Biden took office. 
And then the hallmark here used to 
be, well, the gap between the rich and 
poor, income inequality. Well, guess 
what? That gap, particularly in 2018, 
2019, was the greatest shrinkage in 
modern economic times. 2018, 2019, the 
fastest movement of the poor getting 
less poor, the fastest movement of food 
insecurity shrinking. Congratulations, 
Democrats, you have done a great job. 
It turns out income inequality really 
started to expand last year. Inflation 
crushing people. Except if you own lots 
of assets. If you are one of the rich peo-
ple here, and you have multiple houses, 
you have lots of stocks and bonds, you 
have other things, you got richer or at 
least your assets went up in value. 
b 1800 
Does anyone else see the cruelty 
going on here, or does it just not fit be-
cause you have a pasty White guy here 
giving the speech? 
But the math is the math. I mean, at 
some point the math will always win. 
And my brothers and sisters in the 
Phoenix area—now, Phoenix is a big 
community. 
Remember, 
Maricopa 
County is the fourth most populous—I 
still think we are catching up with 
Harris County, but fourth most popu-
lous county in the country. It is func-
tionally almost seven congressional 
districts. 
And my brothers and sisters in the 
Phoenix area had a 10.9 percent infla-
tion year over year. Go talk to those 
families and explain to them how, 
hasn’t this been a great year for you? 
Aren’t you happy you voted for this? 
And then you start to look at some of 
the other data. And I have got to give 
the left credit. They have done one 
thing that I didn’t think could happen. 
I am seeing some polling coming out of 
my community where, not by a little 
bit, but by almost double digits, His-
panic voters are now going to vote for 
Republicans. And then you see this and 
you start to understand why. 
Look what has happened, particu-
larly to the African American and 
Latino voters—or the population, what 
has happened to their rents? 28 percent 
increases. They may have thought 
Democrats were their protectors, but 
Democrats have basically been their 
tormentors because the policies have 
been so badly designed. 
And when they were voting for these, 
we stood here and explained, do you 
understand what you are about to set 
off? And the arrogance—well, in a 
weird way, thank you. It looks like 
now the Hispanic vote may actually be 
Republican. Is it because we are so 
wonderful, or their policies have been 
so brutal to those communities? 
So let’s have the hits keep going. The 
United States—you have heard this 
over and over and lots of other people 
have come here and talked about this, 
but it is worth saying again. 
What happens when a nation has the 
ability to be secure in its energy? What 
happens to a nation when you are Ger-
many; when you are basically beholden 
to someone else’s hydrocarbons? 
And there is one here, and I am going 
to do this a little bit out of order be-
cause I find it absolutely fascinating. 
We should do this one two or three 
times. Now we understand that a dec-
ade, a decade and a half ago, the pro-
tests in Germany, and now we find out 
much of the activism here, the re-
searchers, the reporters, the journal-
ists that actually do investigative, hey, 
this stuff may have been financed by 
countries that sell hydrocarbons. I 
can’t imagine who that would be. 
But we now know the stories in Ger-
many—you have seen the stories of the 
suitcases of cash going to their green 
movement to shut down their base load 
nuclear, and Germany today is dra-
matically dirtier in greenhouse gases 
than they were 10, 15 years ago because 
they are living on Russian hydro-
carbons and coal. 
And I think out of the 20-plus nuclear 
facilities, I think they have one facil-
ity and they are scrambling to find out 
can they put them back into service. It 
turns out, same concept here. 
I would love for our brothers and sis-
ters on the left to help us actually do 
an investigation of who has been fi-
nancing these shut down the pipelines, 
shut down much of the—particularly 
natural gas, which I have a great fond-
ness for natural gas because of its mir-
acle on reducing greenhouse gases. 
But it looks like much of that part of 
the green movement may have been fi-
nanced by countries that could care 
less about the world’s global warming. 
But it was more about market con-
straints so they could sell more of 
their product. 
And once again, we had become en-
ergy independent. We had become an 
exporter. The Biden administration 
takes over, and all of a sudden, the ex-
tortion games begin. The threat games 
begin. You start to find out you are 
going to be invested by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission because you 
may not have disclosed your global 
warming impact on your investments. 
And then you wonder why it was ac-
tually months ago that natural gas 
prices went through the ceiling. I was 
going to say exploded, but that is a 
really bad pun. It is in the charts. It 
wasn’t an invasion of Ukraine. It was 
the election of Democrats really, really 
screwing up policy. 
And now, we don’t actually have a 
complete answer on this. I am hoping 
it is purely for technical reasons be-
cause a couple of weeks ago I did a cou-
ple of charts here showing how much

base load nuclear is coming offline. 
And the fact of the matter is when that 
comes offline, even with adoption of all 
the clean energy, all the photovoltaic, 
all the wind, we actually are upside 
down. We will have to actually use 
more hydrocarbons. 
And then you hear the story this 
week that the Feds have rescinded li-
cense for a Florida facility that is 
under construction, which I understand 
there are stunning amounts of capital 
already sitting there. I hope this is 
temporary. 
But you would think this would be 
the type of thing we would be strug-
gling, saying we really want non-car-
bon emitting base load power in this 
country. Except for the fact of the 
matter is—and it is reality—photo-
voltaic, wind, they write a lot of 
checks to the Democrats. 
It is a dark thing I say, but the fact 
of the matter is, I can walk you 
through policy after policy after policy 
here where it seems to be chasing—I 
mean, look at H.R. 1 and the other 
things that this place has passed which 
had ultimately nothing to do with ac-
cess to voting. It had to do with build-
ing a model that elects Democrats. 
I mean, financing Democratic cam-
paigns with six to one money; industri-
alizing ballot harvesting because they 
have the networks to do that? I mean, 
it is just— 
But, once again, we virtue signal. We 
say pretty words, and then just hope 
that the public never finds out what is 
actually underlying in the real piece of 
legislation. 
And back to what I said before, con-
gratulations Democrats. You burned 23 
percent more coal last year. 
Yes, I am from Arizona. We are one 
of the photovoltaic—I mean, it is a 
Holy Grail where we are. Power actu-
ally almost goes to zero for two, three, 
four hours in the afternoon because we 
produce so much. But let’s get the poli-
cies right. 
We need storage. There are some 
breakthroughs in storage now. I have a 
fascination with the rust iron battery. 
It doesn’t work in a car because it is 
really big, really heavy, but it works in 
a utility scale. 
But will the left take responsibility 
that they say one thing and the proof, 
they burnt 23 percent more coal last 
year. They made greenhouse gases 
worse. Pretty rhetoric isn’t good math. 
And the movement of natural gas—so 
the folks that say we have got to stop 
pipelines; have you seen what the pipe-
lines actually look like in the United 
States? They are everywhere. 
So the brain trust here raises lots of 
money; does lots of campaigns. We are 
going to cancel something like Key-
stone so they can put the oil on rail-
cars, or maybe shove it out to the West 
Coast of Canada so it can be shipped to 
Asia? Because heaven knows, when 
they crack it, refine it, they do it in a 
really clean, well-regulated, EPA-con-
trolled facilities, right? 
It had nothing to do with what was 
good for the environment. It had to do 
with what was good for raising money. 
And now the brain trust gets to deal 
with the mess they have created 
policywise. So now we get to see great 
stories that we are out visiting Ven-
ezuela. We are out visiting other coun-
tries that functionally are either—I ac-
cept the humiliation. Let’s take the 
humiliation. 
But if my brothers and sisters over 
here are truly committed to their 
green agenda, aren’t they just horrified 
that the decision and policies that they 
have set up have actually made the en-
vironment worse, and now we are actu-
ally going to go to countries that actu-
ally do it in a filthy fashion. 
Huge global warming impacts in the 
way they pull their hydrocarbon, and 
that is actually who we are reaching 
out to to ask for their help. 
Of course, I think the real reality, 
the reason they do is because they have 
an idea what is about to hit them this 
election cycle because they have made 
working men and women’s lives, the 
hard working men and women’s lives in 
this country more miserable, and they 
are pedaling as fast as they can to find 
a way to back off the damage they 
have done. 
So let’s also see the efficiencies. Re-
member, we are going to have an ad-
ministration with no drama. We are 
going to bring professionalism back. 
Well, great. Passport backlog now at 
2 million. VA claim backlog over a 
quarter million. IRS returns backed up 
over 24 million. SSA hearings, taking 
functionally almost a year. 
Tell me something—so back to my 
opening question, give me something, 
anything, one thing that unified leftist 
control of this government has done to 
make people’s lives better; to make the 
future of this country better? It has 
been like a misery factory. 
And then, the next board, I want to 
point out, and it is just one of dozens of 
examples, but it is for people out there 
who may be paying attention to under-
stand what is said over there has noth-
ing to do with what they actually do. 
So remember the build back better, 
you had the Speaker and the President 
and their spokespeople, well, if we 
spend all this money, if we engage in 
this policy, it will be good for inflation. 
Mr. Speaker, can you tell me my 
time? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 15 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, so, 
tucked into—now here is the great 
irony. So we found this, tucked into 
their thousands and thousands of pages 
of build back better, because, remem-
ber, on one hand, they are telling you, 
hey, we are going to make things more 
efficient. We are going to actually help 
reduce inflation. Oh, except for the way 
that if you actually find out it is a 
bunch of pandering to the unions, and 
they made it so you can’t automate 
ports. Huh? 
So you are giving us speeches about 
how the supply chains are the real re-
sponsibility for inflation, and build 
back better is supposed to help infla-
tion, except for you have done the very 
things that will make it so just the op-
posite happens. You have made it so I 
can’t automate ports legally anymore. 
So all this money, your largesse, you 
are going to throw out will go to green 
stuff at ports, but you can’t make it 
more efficient. 
You lied to the American people. And 
how many of my brothers and sisters 
on the left even knew these sorts of lit-
tle land mines were tucked into. I 
mean, they had the unionization of all 
the government employees in my State 
if they want the largesse money for 
family and medical leave; yet they had 
to do it through a collective bargaining 
agreement. 
The legislation was pandering to 
those who financed their campaigns, 
and it would make people’s lives more 
miserable. 
I mean, think of that. Inside their 
build back better was you can’t auto-
mate ports. You can’t make this stuff 
up. 
And then you start to realize, why do 
we have so many unfilled jobs? Some-
thing went horribly off the rails here. 
When we functionally—and I need to 
update this chart because apparently 
the number is actually even worse. 
But we have—I have a fixation on de-
mographic issues. I have done lots of 
presentations here on the floor, be-
cause demographics are actually the 
primary driver of our U.S. sovereign 
debt, and Democrat policies continue 
to make the policy sets around that 
worse. 
So we have 1.5 million more of other 
brothers and sisters who have said, I 
quit, I am out of here, I am taking 
early retirement, I leave, than we ex-
pected. Instead of encouraging our 
brothers and sisters to stay in the 
economy because we have got to step 
up productivity because if we don’t 
step up productivity, we can’t start to 
knock down inflation. 
Remember, what is inflation? It is 
too many dollars chasing too few 
goods. 
There is a couple of ways you attack 
inflation. You can squeeze down the 
money supply, and you saw that hap-
pen with interest rates starting to go 
up. Or you could also do what Reagan 
did in 1981. People forget this. Paul 
Volcker is jacking up interest rates 
and jacking up interest rates. 
Congress, a Democrat Congress at 
that time, also did a tax cut, a tax re-
form to try to make business more pro-
ductive so they would make more stuff. 
Remember, too many dollars chasing 
too few goods and services; make more 
goods and services. 
b 1815 
Then, when you are driving people 
out of the workforce, how do you make 
more goods and services? Get the pol-
icy sets right. 
You say you care about inflation, you 
care about it crushing working men 
and women, and then you do the very 
things that continue to make it worse 
in a society.

H3822 
March 17, 2022 
When we get through this period of 
misery, we still have the thing that 
wipes us out as a society, leads us to 
decades of misery. The current calcula-
tion basically says, in 29 years, my new 
math says we get to be about 210 per-
cent of debt-to-GDP. That is publicly 
held debt. 
Remember, last year, we were bor-
rowing functionally $47,000 a second. I 
know most of this place just cares 
about surviving the next election. I 
mean, look at the legislation that 
keeps being offered. But is there at all 
a moral responsibility here to under-
stand this destroys your kids, this de-
stroys your grandkids, this destroys 
the future generations? We will be 
handing the next couple of generations 
a much poorer—they will live poorer— 
country than we inherited. 
This is $112 trillion of publicly bor-
rowed money adjusted for inflation. 
This isn’t my math; this is CBO’s math 
from a year ago. This is before the 
crazy spending of last year. 
Mr. Speaker, when I came to the 
mike, I shared with you I was a bit 
cranky, and I had had a lot of coffee. I 
don’t believe Democrats are evil. Mis-
guided, yes, but I believe many of them 
are my friends. They have good hearts. 
But you have to stop the policies that 
hurt people. You have to stop hurting 
people, and you have to stop making 
the Nation poorer. 
There are a number of us whose 
ideas, that aren’t even traditionally 
Republican, we could embrace. I mean, 
curing diabetes is one of them. Is that 
Republican or Democrat? It is neither. 
It is just moral. 
Maybe, once in a while, let a Repub-
lican have an amendment or an open 
debate because there is a path. There is 
a path where we can make our future 
better, but you have to stop the blood-
letting. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to go back 
and have some decaf. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
AMERICA IN CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE) for 30 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise tonight to talk about America 
in crisis, and it is crisis after crisis. 
The American people can hardly get 
their feet underneath them. You see, 
after riots, the next thing that came 
was COVID, and then elections, and 
now more COVID mandates, masks, 
more COVID, and now, potentially, the 
thoughts of war. 
But there is a lot more happening on 
top of that. We are in a real crisis in 
America, especially with American en-
ergy. You see, right now, the number 
one call I receive in my office from my 
constituents—and it is mainly the only 
thing they are calling about—is the 
price of gas. 
The price of gas, the average right 
now, is $4.32. People calling my office 
are saying they can hardly afford to fill 
up their tank. They are not sure if they 
are going to be able to fill up their 
tank to take their kids to school, to be 
able to go to the grocery store and af-
ford the high cost of food now. They 
are just not sure where this is going. 
They also call and say they don’t un-
derstand why the Biden administra-
tion, why Congress, why our Federal 
Government isn’t doing anything to 
help Americans be able to pay for gas 
at the pump. 
You see, it wasn’t too long ago that 
we were energy independent in Amer-
ica. There was a different mindset in 
charge. There was a mindset of putting 
our country first, our tax dollars first, 
putting Americans first, and consid-
ering ramping up energy in America 
and growing energy in America instead 
of declining and killing energy in 
America. 
But now, that seems to be the way of 
our government. It is hurting Ameri-
cans, and people cannot afford it. This 
should not be a political issue. This is 
an issue for every single person that 
drives a car and truck. 
Now, it seems to be the goal is to 
make every single American drive an 
electric vehicle. If that is the goal, 
there is a big problem here. It is not up 
to the government, the United States 
Government, to force people to buy an 
electric vehicle. It should be up to the 
United States Government to do things 
like take care of our national security, 
secure our border, help oil companies 
produce more oil to increase energy 
independence, increase natural gas pro-
duction, continue to build more nu-
clear, to grow energy in America. But 
that doesn’t seem to be the way. 
No, we are looking at the third 
straight week in a row of over $100 a 
barrel of oil. Currently, it is at $112.12. 
This is a disaster. 
In March 2020, President Trump di-
rected the Department of Energy to 
purchase 30 million barrels to begin 
filling 
our 
strategic 
reserves. 
But 
President Biden announced in his State 
of the Union that he would once again 
tap the strategic reserves and release 
30 million barrels of oil in a desperate 
attempt to reduce gas prices here at 
home. 
Now, Biden is considering releasing 
even more. This follows an SPR release 
of 50 million barrels of oil in November 
2021, which did nothing to prevent the 
spike in gas prices. And, no, it is not 
what is happening in Ukraine. This was 
happening before Ukraine. 
The SPR is supposed to be used for 
national 
security 
emergencies 
and 
major weather events. These are our 
emergency 
oil 
supplies. 
But 
that 
doesn’t seem to be the case here. It 
seems to be the continuing plan to re-
duce America into being dependent on 
foreign countries. 
You see, the biggest problem started 
on day one when the Keystone XL pipe-
line was completely stopped. That 
would have supplied 830,000 barrels of 
oil from Canada to U.S. refineries. 
That would have helped Americans 
once that was finished. But, no, that 
was an executive order by President 
Biden to suspend it, to suspend all oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands and 
waters. That was a continued America 
last energy plan. 
While a Federal judge ruled the leas-
ing bans to be illegal, the Biden admin-
istration has issued zero new leases on 
Federal lands. That is not helping 
Americans. 
Another issue that happened in May 
2021, President Biden removed sanc-
tions against Nord Stream 2, which 
were previously put in place by former 
President Trump. In February 2022, 
President Biden reversed course and re-
imposed the Trump sanctions, noting 
the overwhelming incentive to move 
away from Russian gas. 
President Biden’s far-left socialist 
agenda, Build Back Better, was an ef-
fort to cripple domestic energy by in-
creasing oil and gas production pay-
ments to 20 percent, increasing bonding 
and surety requirements to more than 
15 times their current levels, imposing 
a new severance tax, and establishing 
new annual fees of $10,000 per mile for 
offshore pipelines. 
President Biden’s fiscal year 2022 
budget request explicitly opposed fund-
ing the construction or maintenance of 
projects that would lower the cost of 
gas, diesel, or energy derived from fos-
sil fuels. 
Biden’s Department of Energy has 
slow-walked liquefied natural gas ex-
ports that could reduce Europe’s de-
pendence on Russia. 
These are all the things that have led 
to the increase of the price of gas at 
the pump that is hurting my constitu-
ents in my district in northwest Geor-
gia. This is hurting Americans. None of 
these things have helped us. 
Now, here is what we have to con-
sider. We also have bigger problems. 
The Consumer Price Index, which is a 
key inflation index, hit a 40-year high 
in February. The CPI increased to 7.9 
percent over the past 12 months, and 
this is inflation that happened before 
Russia invaded Ukraine. You can’t 
blame Putin for that one. This is all 
happening right here at home. 
Let’s talk about inflation and how it 
is hurting Americans. Here is one thing 
that everyone can understand. Used 
cars and trucks are up 41.2 percent; 41.2 
percent is unbelievable. 
If you have been on vacation lately, 
you know that if you try to rent a car 
or truck, they are very hard to find. 
Gasoline is up 38 percent. 
Lodging away from home, going to a 
hotel while you are trying to go on va-
cation, or, say, people that are trav-
eling for business, that is up 25.1 per-
cent. 
Now, if you are cooking at home and 
trying to save money making a meal

for your family, bacon is up 18.8 per-
cent. Peanut butter, for those great 
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches 
that moms and dads make for kids’ 
lunches, is up 15.6 percent. Pork is up 
14 percent. 
Clothing is up. Dresses are up 13.5 
percent. 
Airline fees are up 12.7 percent. 
The cost of a new vehicle is up 12.4 
percent. If you are in the market for a 
truck, well, guess what? You will have 
a hard time getting one, or an SUV, be-
cause many of them are sitting on the 
lots, still waiting for microchips. 
Eggs are up 11.4 percent. Coffee is up 
10.5 percent. Baby food is up 8.4 per-
cent. 
Transportation services are up 6.6 
percent. 
Beer is up. You know there is a prob-
lem when the cost of beer is up 5.3 per-
cent. 
Now, 2021 went down as the worst 
year for inflation since 1981, but it 
looks to be 2022 is going to be worse. 
The problem for Americans is, it is not 
that anyone is increasing their wages. 
They are actually being hurt by all of 
these economic forces that are hitting 
American families hard. 
Don’t forget, the same people that 
were big Democrat voters, which are 
those people suffering with big student 
loans, these are people that are work-
ing their jobs, trying to pay their stu-
dent loans, trying to afford their car 
payments. They can’t afford gas at the 
pump, and no one seems to be helping 
them. 
Inflation is a tax on everyone, and no 
one is exempt. That is what people are 
complaining about here in America, 
not what the people that run around 
Washington think. It is a lot different 
when you talk to people on the ground. 
Now, another thing people are very 
upset about is what is happening at our 
border. We have a true border crisis, 
and it is time to start caring about it. 
Listen, it is an insult to all border 
communities because President Biden 
visited Texas but continued to refuse 
to visit the southern border or other 
surrounding 
communities 
that 
his 
failed open border policies have endan-
gered. 
The real issue is, while President 
Biden is more interested in working 
with Iran, Russia, and China to go re-
enter an Iran nuclear deal, he doesn’t 
seem to care about what is happening 
at the border. 
According to Customs and Border Pa-
trol data, there were 153,941 migrant 
encounters at our southern border in 
January. That is a 96 percent increase 
from the previous year. This was the 
second-worst January on record. Of the 
153,941 illegal immigrants encountered 
at the border, the Biden administration 
released 62,573 of them into the United 
States. 
This new data comes at a time when 
ICE deportations are down 70 percent 
from 2020, the fewest number of depor-
tations in 5 years. This equates to an 
average of just 100 deportations a day, 
even as Border Patrol agents encoun-
tered up to 7,000 illegal immigrants 
daily. 
But only 100 get deported? Why? You 
have to ask why. 
Since Biden took office, over 2 mil-
lion illegal immigrants have been ap-
prehended at our southern border. 
Biden has still not visited the border 
even during this historic crisis. It 
doesn’t seem that President Biden even 
cares. 
Border officials have estimated that 
nearly 400,000 illegal immigrants have 
escaped into the United States without 
being caught under President Biden. 
But we don’t even know if that is the 
right number. That is just an estimate. 
Out of 104,171 migrants issued notices 
to report by ICE between the end of 
March and the end of August 2021, 
47,705 failed to report. They just don’t 
bother showing up. 
b 1830 
There were 10,763 arrests of migrants 
with criminal convictions in fiscal year 
2021; that is up 2,438 from fiscal year 
2020, and that is up 4,269 in fiscal year 
2019. 
But here is the real issue. Fentanyl is 
flowing across our borders. Seizures of 
fentanyl increased by 134 percent in fis-
cal year 2021 under President Biden’s 
watch. 
Now, fentanyl is the number one re-
ported reason of cause of death for 
young people ages 18 to 45. What are we 
doing in our country when this deadly 
drug is flowing across our wide-open 
border that our President doesn’t even 
seem to care about, that no one is in-
terested in closing the border or secur-
ing the border? 
How are we failing Americans and 
failing young people, where fentanyl 
that comes over from China is so easily 
flowing across the border? This is a dis-
aster. It is a complete disaster. 
Now, what I find absolutely mind- 
boggling is how here in Congress we 
passed a $1.5 trillion omnibus bill last 
week that was 2,741 pages, and we 
didn’t even have 24 hours to read it. 
That is a complete failure to the Amer-
ican people and the American tax dol-
lars who are the ones paying the $1.5 
trillion for the omnibus bill. 
There is not a company or a small 
business in the private sector that op-
erates this way. But our Federal Gov-
ernment is reckless and out of control, 
and the American people are feeling 
the consequences. You just have to ask 
the question: Why? Why does Congress 
work this way? It is just not working. 
It is not working for the American peo-
ple. 
Now, this week we were addressed by 
President Zelenskyy and the crisis that 
the 
Ukrainian 
people 
are 
going 
through. It was heart-breaking to hear 
the stories he told, the video that he 
showed, the tragedies that we are hear-
ing about over and over, but we also 
aren’t given enough information. 
Last week, Congress approved $13.6 
billion to go to Ukraine. Now, this is 
after years and years of sending bil-
lions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and 
funding all kinds of things in Ukraine. 
Who does Congress work for? I think 
that is the greatest question. What is 
the purpose of this institution where 
we take American taxpayers’ dollars 
and send it to countries all over the 
world? We send money to all kinds of 
foreign countries and fund all kinds of 
things. 
Now, one of the most fascinating sto-
ries that went on and on across the 
internet 
and 
news 
companies—you 
heard it on TV and saw it on social 
media everywhere—was this big discus-
sion about biolabs. Now, I thought it 
was pretty fascinating, a lot of people 
were interested in it, but we were all 
told no, no, no, you can’t talk about 
biolabs because that is fake news, that 
the United States doesn’t fund biolabs 
in 
Ukraine—the 
United 
States 
wouldn’t do that. 
Well, come to find out, in fact, it is 
true. The same news companies and the 
same sources are telling us that it is 
not true that the United States funds 
biolabs—you could also look up their 
older news stories from years ago 
where, in fact, they were talking about 
the United States funding biolabs. So 
the misinformation going on is real 
and the American people deserve to 
know what they are paying for. 
This comes on the heels of after 2 
years—and this is just so tragic—that 
not only the United States but the en-
tire world has been dealing with 
COVID–19. Now, it has been a true trag-
edy what has happened with COVID. 
Over 968,000 Americans have died—that 
is according to The New York Times 
today—over 6 million people have died 
worldwide. That is according to The 
New York Times today. 
For the last 2 years, Americans have 
dealt with the consequences of U.S. 
funding these labs and funding the gain 
of function research. Now, it is some-
thing that we really have to recognize 
and we have to talk about, but our gov-
ernment did fund the gain of function 
research. We know that to be true 
through EcoHealth Alliance. 
The gain of function research is what 
allowed the virus that is transmitted 
between bats to be turned into a 
virus—like a Dr. Frankenstein virus— 
that can be transmitted between hu-
mans. We have to ask the question: 
Why would the United States Govern-
ment engage in funding something as 
horrific as that? How is that science? It 
is a good thing to ask these questions. 
Now, here is what else is interesting. 
Just today Dr. Fauci, who happened to 
be the one to help fund the gain of 
function research, decided to come out 
and say that mask mandates should be 
brought back. This is at a time where 
we are finally getting rid of mask man-
dates. He is also recommending a 
fourth COVID vaccine shot. 
Now, I don’t know about you guys 
but many of us were vaccinated as kids 
against polio, we had our MMR, and I 
have never seen the CDC coming out,

saying, oh, you got to get your second 
polio shot, you got to get your third, 
you got to get your fourth, and this 
may continue to keep going. 
I think the question we all should 
ask is: When does it stop and when are 
enough vaccines enough? We don’t have 
that question because now Congress is 
discussing 
and 
debating 
a 
future 
COVID bill, an emergency bill. This is 
a future COVID bill to fund future 
variants and future vaccines. And not 
only future vaccines for the United 
States, but future vaccines for the en-
tire world because somehow the United 
States is responsible for vaccinating 
the 
world 
against 
future 
COVID 
variants that we haven’t even seen yet. 
And somehow Congress thinks that 
we should do emergency funding, pos-
sibly up to $22 billion to study and pre-
pare for future COVID variants and fu-
ture COVID vaccines, and as many 
things as we need to do, but yet we 
aren’t seeing them. How is that nec-
essary to have emergency funding at 
$22 billion to fund something that we 
don’t know is going to happen and 
shouldn’t happen and would never have 
happened without the U.S.-funded gain 
of function research to the Wuhan lab? 
I think these are questions worth ask-
ing. 
Now, another thing I would like to 
point out is President Trump had 
asked Congress for $22 billion to build a 
wall down at the southern border. 
Imagine if Congress had found it im-
portant or recognized the important 
need to go ahead and fund $22 billion 
back in 2017 or 2018, that wall would 
have been built. 
I can tell you right now, I don’t think 
we would be seeing and hearing about 
the numbers of illegal immigrants 
coming across our border and deadly 
fentanyl coming across like this. Imag-
ine if Congress had taken seriously bor-
der security under President Trump 
and funded that $22 billion then that 
now Congress is considering funding for 
future COVID that we don’t even have 
yet. These are good questions to ask. 
These are the kind of questions that 
the regular American people ask, not 
the ones that live here in the Wash-
ington D.C. bubble; they are very dis-
connected here with real America. 
Now, this is the thing that I just find 
so amazing. As we consider funding fu-
ture COVID and future COVID vac-
cines, we have people at home that are 
sick and tired of their children being 
masked in school. They do not want to 
be forced to take a vaccine that they 
feel they should have the ability to de-
cide about their own health, if they 
want to take it or not. 
We are still trying to get back on 
track with not having to wear masks 
on airplanes, not having to send our 
kids to school to be masked, and not 
have to be shut down anymore. We 
have not recovered yet from the COVID 
crisis of the past 2 years. But, no, we 
have to consider more future COVID 
variants and future vaccines, and vac-
cinating 
the 
world 
against 
future 
COVID everything. 
It never seems to stop, it is crisis 
after crisis. Unfortunately, a U.S.-fund-
ed gain of function research in a U.S.- 
funded lab in China gave birth to 
COVID–19 that has hurt the entire 
world. 
Here is what we need to discuss. We 
need to ask the question: What is hap-
pening in these U.S.-funded labs? And 
we need to be willing to talk about it. 
We also need to ask the questions 
about the VAERS statistics. What if 
there are vaccine injuries? What if 
there are vaccine deaths? 
It is okay to ask these questions be-
cause these may have affected people’s 
lives, and that is important to do, 
right? But when we are talking about 
biolabs, we do know for a fact that the 
U.S. has funded the contracts not only 
to take over the labs, reconstruct 
them, but also build them. This goes 
through grants through private compa-
nies at millions and millions of dollars. 
Now, what if these biolabs are han-
dling very dangerous pathogens that 
may lead to the deaths in people in the 
areas. There are reports of possibly 
deadly 
pathogens 
escaping 
these 
biolabs in places like Ukraine, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan, that is responsible for 
killing people. What if that is true? I 
think these are questions that we 
should ask because no American cit-
izen wants to be held morally and ethi-
cally responsible, and the U.S. Govern-
ment should not be funding something 
that is killing people in a country that 
is not even our own, let alone here at 
home. 
These are worthy questions. For that 
reason, because it has become such an 
issue and because it upsets so many 
people that I talk to constantly, I have 
introduced a bill to stop taxpayer fund-
ing for bioweapons and eliminate these 
programs from the Federal Govern-
ment because no government should be 
creating bioweapons. That is evil and 
wrong. 
Now, the name of this bill is the 
Stopping the Spread of Taxpayer-Fund-
ed Bioweapons Act. What if strange 
outbreaks 
surrounding 
U.S.-funded 
biolabs are the result of these labs and 
the work that is taking place in them? 
What if these labs are creating viruses 
just like COVID–19? 
This is something that all of us 
should be against. That is why it would 
be so important to pass this bill and 
make sure that our United States Gov-
ernment is never funding anything 
deadly and never funding something 
like COVID–19. These are consequences 
that we cannot take and we should not 
handle and we should not ever con-
sider. 
Now, as we go further, we have a lot 
of issues to consider. We have an econ-
omy that is definitely in trouble. We 
have hyperinflation and gas prices out 
of control. We are looking at what is 
going to happen in Ukraine with Rus-
sia and what is going to happen in the 
world with all these sanctions. There 
are some issues to consider. 
Now, the value of our dollar is ex-
tremely important. The value of our 
dollar affects our entire economy. If 
the value of our dollar were to go down 
suddenly, that would affect all Ameri-
cans. Right now we are in a critical 
time where Saudi Arabia is discussing 
with China—talking to them about 
possibly switching from the petrodollar 
to trading with China’s currency. 
We have sanctioned Russia. And as 
Russia is looking at taking Ukraine 
and they are invading Ukraine and 
killing people in Ukraine, Russia has 
turned to China. Just recently Russia 
made a $117.5 billion deal with Presi-
dent Xi of China. That deal is to sell oil 
and gas to China. 
Now with sanctions tightening on 
Putin and Russia, will we see Russia 
turn to China and switch to China’s 
currency? What if Russia and Saudi 
Arabia switch from the dollar to Chi-
na’s currency? Then think further, 
what happens if countries like Ven-
ezuela or Cuba or any other country 
turns to China’s currency? 
If we go into a situation where we 
have two world competing currencies, 
the dollar is going to be hit very hard, 
and that is going to hurt America’s 
economy, that is going to hurt every 
single one of us. If we think we are suf-
fering under high inflation right now 
and high gas prices, well, we haven’t 
seen anything yet. This is a dangerous 
situation and these are the things that 
I don’t hear being talked about here in 
Congress very much. 
These are not the things that our 
leaders are considering when they are 
beating the drums of war—wanting to 
go in and go to war with nuclear Rus-
sia. These are not the things that are 
being considered for our children and 
for our country’s future, but these are 
the most important things they should 
be considering. Unfortunately, they are 
not. 
b 1845 
Now, what we all should be doing is 
encouraging President Zelenskyy and 
President Putin to get to the negoti-
ating table and stop people from being 
killed. That should be the most impor-
tant thing we care about. 
Sanctions are being put in place, and 
we should be considering what are 
going to be the real human costs when 
we are stopping countries from trading 
very important products like grain, 
fertilizer, and energy because it may be 
a punishment to those governments, 
but the real punishment is to the peo-
ple in other countries and our own. 
So my questions for our Congress— 
our 
United 
States 
Congress—are: 
Which country do we honestly serve? 
Which country do we honestly care 
about? And which people do we care 
about? 
Because this body right here is fund-
ed by the American people and their 
hard-earned tax dollars, and the Amer-
ican people and their hard-earned tax 
dollars are the people we should con-
sider first. 
It is the United States of America we 
should consider first. It is the United

States currency, the dollar, we should 
consider first, and it is the United 
States economy we should consider 
first, our small businesses, our big 
businesses, and our border that should 
matter. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, tonight, I will fin-
ish with this: I think it is important 
for the United States Congress to talk 
more, to slow down in our decisions, to 
read our bills—every single one of us 
has the time to read them—and for 
every single one of us to vote in per-
son—not by proxy—and not simply by 
saying ‘‘yea’’ or ‘‘nay’’. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for 
this time, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our shelter from the 
storms, protect the Ukrainian people 
as they trust You for safety. 
Lord, all the good we will ever have 
comes from You. You have been faith-

You, as this conflict continues to 
maim, kill, and destroy. 
Lord, provide our lawmakers with

f 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now, yesterday, 
the Senate moved forward on a dozen 
judicial and administrative nominees, 
many of them with solid bipartisan 
support. 
Today, we will hold three more floor 
votes: two to confirm a pair of district 
judges and one to move on the nomina-
tion of Judge Ali Nathan for the Sec-
ond Circuit. 
When I met Judge Nathan 10 years 
ago, I thought, ‘‘Here is someone truly 
special and truly brilliant,’’ and, a dec-
ade later, I still hold that view. 
Ask her colleagues on the bench or 
ask her colleagues from private prac-
tice or even the likes of President 
Obama, and they will all say the same 
thing: Judge Nathan is a first-rate ju-
rist and a consensus builder by nature. 
I am pleased the Senate is acting on 
this well-deserving judge today, setting 
up a final confirmation vote next week. 
NOMINATION OF JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, speaking of nomi-
nations today, today is the last day the 
Senate will meet before we begin a 
truly historic series of hearings next 
Monday, starting at 11 a.m. The Senate 
Judiciary Committee will begin hear-
ings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-
son’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
These televised judiciary hearings 
will give millions of Americans a 
chance to hear from the judge directly 
for the first time since her nomination. 
These hearings matter. Americans de-
serve to hear for themselves from 
Judge Jackson, whose decisions will 
echo across American law for a long, 
long time. 
Of course, the historic nature of this 
nominee must not be minimized. Of the 
115 Justices who have sat on the Court, 
only 5—only 5—have been women; only 
2—2—have been African Americans, 
Justices Thurgood Marshall and Clar-
ence Thomas; only 1 has been Hispanic, 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor from the 
Bronx. 
But, to date, never has an African- 
American woman come before the Ju-
diciary Committee for consideration to 
the 
highest 
Court. 
Judge 
Ketanji 
Brown Jackson will be the very first.

March 17, 2022 
And the public will also see that her 
credentials, her vast experience in both 
public and private practice, and her 
near 9 years on the Federal bench 
make her stupendously qualified to 
bear the title ‘‘Justice.’’ 
I thank Chairman DURBIN and the 
members of the Judiciary Committee 
for their work orchestrating what has 
been a fair and quick nomination proc-
ess, and all of us look forward to next 
week’s hearings. 
OIL 
Madam President, now, on oil, I want 
to return to a worrying trend. Over the 
past few days, the price of crude has 
actually gone down, but the average 
price of a gallon is still stuck at nearly 
$4.30. If anyone thinks this is fair, effi-
cient, or sensible, they are probably an 
oil executive. No matter what, the di-
vergence between the price of crude 
and the price of a gallon is causing im-
mense—immense—damage to American 
families at a time when they are all 
struggling to make ends meet. 
Meanwhile, it is nothing short of re-
pugnant for oil companies to be tout-
ing what are truly dizzying profit mar-
gins while soaking American families 
with these exorbitant prices. Last year, 
the top 25 oil and gas companies re-
ported a combined $205 billion in prof-
its. And what have they done with this 
avalanche of cash? Invest in new tech-
nologies? Nope. Give Americans a 
break at the pump? Nope. 
They have been using their profits to 
reward shareholders by implementing 
stock buybacks. Listen to this. Accord-
ing to a recent Bloomberg report, in 
the fourth quarter of last year, oil and 
gas 
companies 
increased 
stock 
buybacks by over 2,000 percent from 
the previous year—2,000 percent—and 
none of it to produce more energy or 
invest in new technologies; just a mas-
sive windfall for shareholders. And 
their increase in stock buyback over 
the previous year is more than any 
other industry by quite a large margin. 
The Senate, I am glad to say, is soon 
going to call executives from oil and 
gas companies to come testify and ex-
plain why they see fit to reward share-
holders instead of finding ways to give 
Americans a break at the pump. 
RUSSIA 
Madam President, finally, on PNTR, 
on a final note, the House today is ex-
pected to vote on legislation revoking 
permanent normal trade relations with 
Russia. 
For weeks, Members of the Senate, 
the House, and the White House have 
been working together to draft a 
strong and effective bill that will in-
crease the pain on Putin’s Russia and 
that our European allies will accept. 
To date, both parties, Democratic and 
Republican, remain united in sending 
Putin a clear message. His inhumane 
violence against the Ukrainian people 
will come at a crippling price. 
And today’s step by the House is an-
other way we are making that come 
true. When the House passes this bill, I 
expect it will have broad bipartisan 
support here in the Senate, and I will 
work with my colleagues to find a way 
to move it through this Chamber 
quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
next week, the Judiciary Committee 
will hear firsthand from President 
Biden’s Supreme Court nominee Judge 
Jackson. It will be a serious and dig-
nified process. The American people 
need answers to more important ques-
tions than what somebody wrote in the 
nominee’s high school yearbook. 
The Senate needs to examine Judge 
Jackson’s qualifications, and we need 
to examine her judicial philosophy and 
see if she will apply laws as written 
and weigh cases without favoritism. 
And we need to explore why the far-
thest left activists in the country des-
perately wanted Judge Jackson, in par-
ticular, for this vacancy. 
Judicial philosophy is a key quali-
fication for the Supreme Court. There 
are plenty of smart lawyers in the 
country, but they don’t all understand 
that a judge’s proper role is to apply 
the text of the laws neutrally. Some 
would rather start with liberal out-
comes and reason backward. 
So it is unsettling that senior Demo-
crats have lauded Judge Jackson for 
the ‘‘empathy’’ they suggest shapes her 
judicial approach. So if you are the 
litigant for whom the judge has special 
preexisting empathy, well, it is your 
lucky day; but the other party is being 
denied their fair day in court. 
The Senate Democratic leader, the 
House majority whip, and multiple 
legal academics all say Judge Jackson 
will rule with ‘‘empathy.’’ Helpfully, 
one professor clarified which kinds of 
litigants would benefit from her empa-
thy. He proposed that because of Judge 
Jackson’s ‘‘ample criminal defense ex-
perience,’’ she would ‘‘bring a measure 
of empathy to the criminal defense 
cases, the Fourth and Fifth Amend-
ment cases.’’ 
So liberals are saying that Judge 
Jackson’s service as a criminal defense 
lawyer and then on the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission give her special 
empathy for convicted criminals. Her 
supporters look at her resume and de-
duce a special empathy for criminals. I 
guess that means that government 
prosecutors and innocent crime victims 
start each trial at a disadvantage. 
That isn’t my assertion. That is what 
the nominee’s liberal supporters are all 
saying. In fact, the nominee has all but 
said it herself. Here is what the Wash-
ington Post reported last year when 
Judge Jackson was nominated to the 
DC Circuit: 
She and her allies credit her work as a pub-
lic defender as helping her develop empathy. 
And here they quote the nominee 
herself: 
There is a direct line from my defender 
service to what I do on the bench, and I 
think it’s beneficial. 
So, look, nobody is saying that pub-
lic defenders ought to be disqualified 
from judicial service. It is an impor-
tant role. But as the New York Times 
reported this week, the Biden adminis-
tration is on an intentional quest to 
stuff the Federal judiciary full of this 
one perspective. Even amid a national 
crime wave, a disproportionate share of 
the new judges President Biden has 
nominated 
share 
this 
professional 
background that liberals say gives 
judges special empathy for criminal de-
fendants. 
Here is the New York Times: 
It is a sea change in the world of judicial 
nominations. . . . The type of high-profile 
murder cases handled by some of Mr. Biden’s 
nominees would have been considered dis-
qualifying only a few years ago; now the 
president . . . is actively seeking to name 
more jurists who have such experience. 
It is not just Judge Jackson. 
At least 20 other lawyers with significant 
public defender experience have been nomi-
nated by the Biden administration. 
One soft-on-crime advocate marveled 
to the reporter: 
We have never seen anything like this. 
Such enthusiasm. 
President Biden is deliberately work-
ing to make the whole Federal judici-
ary softer on crime. Even liberals ad-
mitted as much. They actually applaud 
it. But with murders and carjackings 
skyrocketing nationwide, I doubt the 
American people feel the same way. 
I look forward to learning more 
about how Judge Jackson believes her 
service as a criminal defense attorney 
leads her to interpret the text of our 
laws and our Constitution differently 
than other judges. If any judicial nomi-
nee really does have special empathy 
for some parties over others, that is 
not an asset; it is a problem. 
ENERGY 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, as Democratic policies have un-
leashed runaway inflation, families 
have felt particular pain at the gas 
pump. 
Since President Biden took office, 
gas prices have climbed nearly $2—$2. 
The Biden administration wants to 
claim that a full year’s worth of price 
hikes were all caused by a war Putin 
started 3 weeks ago. But this fictional 
version of events doesn’t fool anyone. 
Two years ago, then-candidate Biden 
told everyone he was ready to wage 
war on the most reliable forms of 
American energy: 
No ability for the oil industry to continue 
to drill, period. [It] ends. 
That is President Biden.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1231 
March 17, 2022 
I guarantee you . . . We’re going to end 
fossil fuel. 
In other words, either the Biden ad-
ministration 
has 
a 
shaky 
under-
standing of supply and demand or soar-
ing energy prices have been baked into 
their agenda right from the beginning. 
For 14 months now, energy policy has 
followed a disturbing pattern. First, 
the Biden administration rolls out a di-
rect attack on American energy, then 
working families feel the pinch, and 
then Democrats try to deflect the 
blame. Take the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
President Biden made canceling it a 
day one priority. Then, as gasoline, 
diesel, and other energy prices climbed, 
the White House justified itself by say-
ing the project would have taken years 
to affect prices anyway. 
The problem is, back during the 
Obama administration, their own anal-
ysis suggested the project would be 
fully operational by 2013. They spent a 
decade fighting against a pipeline that 
would have taken a couple of years to 
come online by complaining it was not 
immediate enough. 
That was their argument a decade 
ago, and it is their argument now. The 
pipeline could have been built multiple 
times over in the time the Democrats 
spent resisting it. Besides, if slow con-
struction were really the problem, the 
administration would be rushing to 
rein in their own regulatory army that 
is handcuffing other new and existing 
pipelines with mountains of extra bu-
reaucracy. 
Just weeks ago, while Putin was al-
ready amassing forces and trying to 
make energy hostages out of Western 
Europe, the Biden administration’s 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion went out of its way to make per-
mitting new American natural gas 
pipelines radically more difficult. 
Here is yet another example. Last 
year, the Biden administration di-
rected the SEC to prioritize discour-
aging loans, capital, and financing for 
fossil fuel energy projects. But now 
that a worldwide scramble has sent 
prices sky-high, the administration 
blames the industry and says it is 
‘‘time for oil and gas companies to 
work with Wall Street to unleash our 
productive capacity.’’ The administra-
tion that campaigned on ending fossil 
fuels now claims the fossil fuel compa-
nies are just layabouts who don’t want 
to drill. It is enough to make your head 
spin. 
Oh, and President Biden rushed to 
lash America back to the mast of a cli-
mate deal that actually gave China a 
pass to keep increasing their emis-
sions. As Germany prepared to give 
Putin an even tighter hold on Europe’s 
market for natural gas with the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline, President Biden 
fought bipartisan efforts to stop the 
pipeline. 
His response to soaring prices hurt-
ing families last year was to go hat in 
hand and beg OPEC and Russia to 
produce more. And now that Russia has 
invaded Ukraine, the Biden administra-
tion is reportedly exploring more im-
ports—listen to this—from Venezuela 
and Iran, totalitarian regimes with 
contempt for human rights and the en-
vironment. 
So it turns out the Biden administra-
tion doesn’t mind fossil fuel production 
after all. They just don’t want to ‘‘Buy 
American.’’ The administration will 
buy oil from the Supreme Leader of 
Iran; they will buy oil from Maduro. If 
North Korea had oil, they would prob-
ably try to buy that, too. Anything— 
anything—to avoid keeping those jobs 
and that energy independence right 
here in the USA. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Virginia. 
MONACAN INDIAN NATION 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
today to speak about a really impor-
tant victory in Virginia yesterday—a 
victory for the Monacan Indian Nation, 
and it is a victory that I have had a 
hand in over the course of many years. 
I want to describe it and celebrate it. 
When the English came to Virginia 
first in 1607, there were thriving Vir-
ginia Native populations. The popu-
lations east—in eastern Virginia, east 
of Richmond—were part of a larger 
confederacy called the Powhatan Con-
federacy, 
and 
they 
spoke 
an 
Algonquian-based language. There were 
Tribes in the southern part of Virginia 
that spoke an Iroquois-based language, 
and Tribes in the western part of Vir-
ginia spoke a Sioux-based language. 
One of these Tribes was the Monacan 
Tribe. 
John Smith, in 1607, 1608, and 1609, 
traveled all around the Chesapeake 
Bay and its tributaries and did some 
very detailed mapmaking of the area, 
including a town that he called the 
chief Monacan town named Rassawek. 
Rassawek is on a point of land in what 
is now Fluvanna County, VA, where 
the Rivanna River and the James River 
combine. 
Rassawek was the headquarters, or 
the chief administrative town, of the 
Monacan Tribal Nation. The story of 
the Virginia Tribes is one of triumph, 
but also one of tragedy. Many of the 
Tribes made peace treaties with the 
English in the 1670s. All of these Tribes 
were discriminated against, and some 
were driven far from their homes. 
The Monacan Tribe was driven by the 
English settlers from Rassawek, fur-
ther west into Amherst County, and 
then many of them were driven even 
further west into the middle west end 
and other places. But Rassawek main-
tained its sacred status to the Monacan 
Nation for many reasons, including the 
fact that so many of Monacan families 
were buried there and their remains 
are still there. 
An aspect of the tragedy of the Vir-
ginia Tribes is that: When I was elected 
to be a Senator in 2012, none of the Vir-
ginia Tribes had ever been recognized, 
even though many still live intact in 
communities in Virginia. There were 
over 500 Tribes that had been federally 
recognized. The Virginia Tribes are 
part of exhibits at the Smithsonian 
Museum at the foot of Capitol Hill; and 
yet they had never been recognized. 
And they had never been recognized for 
three reasons. 
One, they made peace treaties with 
the English rather than with the 
United States. Often, recognition be-
gins with the treaty entered into with 
the United States. Second, often, rec-
ognition is determined by extensive 
submission of land records and other 
records. Many Virginia courthouses 
were burned during the Civil War, and 
so records establishing Tribal lands, for 
example, were destroyed. 
But, finally, and most cruelly, Vir-
ginia had an official named Walter 
Plecker who served as the State’s di-
rector of the Department of Vital Sta-
tistics from 1920 until the 1960s. And he 
was a eugenicist. He believed there was 
no such thing as Indians, that they 
were all color. And, systemically, he 
determined to take every record he 
could find of Tribal communities in 
Virginia and change the racial designa-
tion of those records—birth certifi-
cates, marriage licenses, death no-
tices—of Indian members to ‘‘color,’’ 
even to the point of disinterring Indi-
ans who had been buried in cemeteries 
that were primarily cemeteries for 
Caucasians. This made it, again, very 
difficult for these Tribes. They refer to 
this as the ‘‘paper genocide’’ for them 
to assert their claim for Tribal rec-
ognition. 
I started working with the Monacan 
and six other Tribes when I was mayor 
of Richmond on this issue because I be-
came friends with a guy named Steve 
Adkins, who is the chief of one of these 
Tribes, the Chickahominy Tribe. 
We worked over the course of many, 
many years—these Tribes coming to 
Congress and asking for Federal rec-
ognition. And when I came into office 
in January of 2013, this was very, very 
high on my to-do list, to finally right 
this historic wrong and correct an in-
justice 
and 
allow 
these 
Virginia 
Tribes—whose 
stories 
are 
so 
well 
known and still live in these commu-
nities—to finally be recognized. 
Now, we have gotten seven Tribes 
recognized—one through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs process, the Pamunkey 
Tribe, and six through an act of Con-
gress. I thank the Presiding Officer be-
cause all of my colleagues joined to-
gether at the end of 2018 and, in a unan-
imous vote, finally did justice by the 
Virginia Tribes, including the Monacan 
Tribe. 
Now onto Rassawek. The Monacans 
were driven further west and now have 
their, sort of, Tribal headquarters in a 
place called Bear Mountain in Amherst 
County. The chief of the Tribe is a man 
named Ken Branham. Ken is a good 
friend. 
In 2014, a local authority, the James 
River Water Authority in Fluvanna 
County, decided that strategic location 
at the merger of two rivers would be a 
perfect place to build big water treat-
ment intake and treatment facility. It

is a growing community. There are 
more water needs in the community. 
The facility was needed, but the site 
they chose for the construction of the 
facility was Rassawek. 
The authority proceeded forward to 
purchase the land and then undertake 
engineering studies to build this water 
treatment facility. At the time, 2014, 
the Monacans had not yet been feder-
ally recognized. They could complain, 
and they could argue, but they didn’t 
have the clout that Federal recognition 
would eventually give them. Yet many 
people rallied to the Monacans’ cause 
and said, ‘‘Look, we preserve other 
sites all the time.’’ 
Virginia is first in the Nation in pre-
serving, for example, Civil War battle-
field sites, and we preserved the ances-
tral 
home 
of 
the 
Powhatan 
of 
Werowocomoco on the York River, 
which is soon to be a national park. 
Should we allow Rassawek to be essen-
tially destroyed and the remains of 
Monacans buried there for generations 
to be disturbed? 
Armed with Federal recognition, the 
Monacans attracted even more support. 
The National Trust for Historic Preser-
vation, in 2020, named Rassawek as one 
of the most 11 endangered sites in the 
country. A huge grassroots effort de-
veloped because of the hard work of the 
Tribe that assembled thousands and 
thousands of supporting individuals— 
some very nearby Rassawek, but some 
very far away—to advocate that there 
has to be a better solution for this 
water treatment need in Fluvanna 
County than to disturb and destroy 
Rassawek. 
Yesterday, the James River Water 
Authority, in a unanimous vote, de-
cided to set aside their plan to do the 
water intake facility in Rassawek and 
to donate the land that they have pur-
chased for that facility to the Monacan 
Tribe. The Monacan Nation, in grati-
tude, pledges to work together with the 
James River Water Authority to find a 
more acceptable site. A number of al-
ternatives have already been identi-
fied. 
This summer, I was canoeing on the 
James River. I canoed the entire James 
River from where it starts, the Alle-
gheny Mountains, to Fort Monroe in 
Chesapeake Bay—350 miles. It took me 
26 days that I spread over the spring, 
summer, and fall. One day in August, I 
was canoeing from a town called New 
Kent to Columbia, passing Rassawek, 
which was on river left as I went down-
stream. 
So I reached out to Chief Branham, 
knowing that the fight about the fu-
ture of Rassawek was underway. I said: 
Could you and Tribal leaders meet me? 
I will pull my canoe onshore when I 
pass by. Meet me and talk to me about 
the status of this fight and why it is so 
important to the Monacan Nation to 
win. 
So coming down the river with a 
friend, my former State director who 
used to work on this Tribal recognition 
issue, John Knapp—I want to thank 
him, as well as other staffers, Evan and 
Nick and Tyee and Mary and other 
staffers in my office, who worked on 
this. John and I pulled our canoe over 
on the shore in this beautiful spot in 
rural Virginia where the two rivers 
come together. We beached the canoe 
on a sand point, climbed a bluff, and 
met Chief Branham and other members 
of Monacan leadership to see the beau-
ty of the site and to share a meal but 
also to talk to them about the impor-
tance of Rassawek and why they real-
ly, really needed to win this battle. 
They don’t have a plan to develop 
Rassawek. They are not going to build 
anything there. They just want it to be 
preserved in its natural beauty out of 
respect for Monacan people who have 
lived there for nearly 5,000 years. Yes-
terday, this unanimous vote by the 
local water authority—a vote of re-
spect, a vote of acknowledgment—rec-
ognized that this is a sacred site. 
We in Virginia, we love our history. 
We love our history, and we don’t want 
to lose it. The history of the Monacan 
Nation, the history of all of our Tribes 
is worthy of battling. You don’t win 
every battle. The Monacan Nation won 
a really important one yesterday, and 
it might not have happened. Ninety- 
nine of my colleagues joined with me 
to make sure that the Monacan Nation 
and the other Virginia Tribes were fi-
nally, after hundreds of years, given 
Federal recognition. 
I just wanted to express my con-
gratulations to the Monacan Nation 
and my appreciation to my colleagues 
for helping me do something good. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF GIGI SOHN 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Senate Commerce Committee recently 
voted on the nomination of Gigi Sohn 
to be a member of the Federal Commu-
nications Commission. I voted against 
her nomination for a number of serious 
reasons, as did the 13 other Republican 
committee members. 
I was deeply disappointed that not 
one of my Democratic colleagues on 
the committee stepped forward to af-
firm what should be glaringly obvious: 
that Ms. Sohn is not an appropriate 
candidate for a position on the Federal 
Communications Commission. 
One substantial concern I have with 
Ms. Sohn’s nomination is her extreme 
position on net neutrality. 
Back in 2014, the Obama administra-
tion decided that the Federal Govern-
ment wasn’t regulating the internet 
enough. So in 2015, the Obama Federal 
Communications Commission passed 
what was known as the Open Internet 
Order—mislabeled, I would add, but 
which dramatically expanded the Fed-
eral Government’s power over the 
internet. The justification for this 
massive regulatory expansion was net 
neutrality. 
Now, net neutrality is a concept that 
enjoys broad support in both parties. I 
support net neutrality and rules that 
prevent blocking, throttling, and the 
paid prioritization of internet traffic. I 
don’t think a major service provider 
should be able to block a small news 
startup. But what the Obama FCC did 
in 2015 went far beyond net neutrality. 
The Obama FCC asserted broad, new 
government powers over the internet 
using rules that were designed for tele-
phone monopolies back during the 
Great Depression. This opened the door 
to a whole host of internet regulations, 
including 
price 
regulations, 
and 
unsurprisingly, broadband investment 
declined as a result. 
That was a problem for Americans 
generally, who benefit when the United 
States is at the forefront of internet 
growth and expansion, and it was par-
ticularly bad news for Americans in 
rural States like South Dakota. Get-
ting broadband to rural communities is 
already more challenging than install-
ing broadband in cities or suburbs, and 
the possibility of heavier regulations 
acted as a further disincentive to ex-
panding access. 
Fast-forward to 2017, and the Federal 
Communications 
Commission 
under 
Chairman Pai voted to repeal those 
heavyhanded regulations passed by the 
Obama FCC, and here is what hap-
pened: 
Broadband 
investment 
re-
bounded, and broadband access ex-
panded. Internet speeds increased. Our 
Nation positioned itself at the fore-
front of the 5G revolution. While Euro-
pean internet providers were slowing 
internet speeds during the pandemic, 
American providers were increasing 
them. All this despite the repeal of the 
heavyhanded 
internet 
regulation 
Democrats claimed we needed—or more 
accurately, because of the repeal of the 
heavyhanded 
regulation 
Democrats 
claimed we needed. 
Why do I go into all this history? 
Well, because Ms. Sohn not only wants 
to bring back the heavyhanded inter-
net regulation of the Obama adminis-
tration, but she wants to go further 
and have the FCC regulate broadband 
rates and set data caps. 
Just as service providers are working 
to implement nationwide 5G networks, 
Ms. Sohn wants to reinstate rules that 
will discourage broadband investment 
and diminish access opportunities for 
Americans outside of major cities and 
suburban areas. That is a big problem. 
The light-touch approach to internet 
regulation that the Federal Govern-
ment has historically taken has re-
sulted in growth and access, both of 
which would be threatened by Ms. 
Sohn’s agenda. 
Now, while I was very pleased that 
the FCC under Chairman Pai repealed

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1233 
March 17, 2022 
President Obama’s heavyhanded inter-
net regulation, I believe the best solu-
tion for the long term is for Congress 
to step in and pass bipartisan net neu-
trality legislation. Swings in net neu-
trality policy from administration to 
administration do not encourage long- 
term broadband investment. 
I believe there is bipartisan support 
for a long-term legislative solution but 
not, it would seem, from Ms. Sohn, who 
has openly disparaged bipartisan work 
on this issue. Now, I think Ms. Sohn 
would be fine if Congress produces a 
bill to her liking, but I have serious 
concerns that if she thought a bipar-
tisan solution didn’t go far enough, she 
would ignore the will of Congress and 
use her position at the FCC to impose 
the heavyhanded regulatory regime she 
favors. 
As a resident of a rural State, I am 
also concerned about Ms. Sohn’s posi-
tion on expanding broadband access to 
rural 
communities—an 
issue 
every 
Member of this body cares deeply 
about. She has been publicly hostile to 
the efforts of rural broadband compa-
nies in expanding reliable internet ac-
cess to rural areas, while at the same 
time supporting the use of scarce gov-
ernment dollars to build new internet 
networks in already well-served urban 
areas. 
As someone who has worked long and 
hard to expand internet access for 
unserved Americans, I find her hos-
tility to rural broadband companies 
very troubling. The vast majority of 
these companies have spent years 
building out reliable networks to some 
of the most remote parts of the coun-
try, allowing more rural areas, like 
those in South Dakota, to reap the 
benefits 
of 
advanced 
services 
in 
healthcare, education, and economic 
development. 
It is not only Republicans who have 
taken note of her hostility to the needs 
of rural Americans. Our former Demo-
cratic colleague from North Dakota 
has also questioned how one could sup-
port rural broadband and Ms. Sohn. 
Ms. Sohn’s policy positions alone 
would lead me to oppose her nomina-
tion, but there are other even more 
troubling factors that should be lead-
ing Members of both parties to oppose 
her nomination. 
To start with, Ms. Sohn was not 
forthcoming to the Commerce Com-
mittee about her past history on the 
board of a company that was ordered to 
cease operations after being found in 
violation of copyright laws. This raises 
serious concerns about her fitness to 
sit on the FCC. 
After questions were raised about her 
involvement with this company’s set-
tlement with broadcasters, she did vol-
unteer to recuse herself, if she is con-
firmed, on a variety of issues related to 
broadcasting and copyright violations. 
But why on Earth—why on Earth 
should we choose a Commissioner who 
would have to recuse herself from par-
ticipating in substantial parts of the 
FCC’s work? How does it serve Ameri-
cans to have an FCC Commissioner 
who can’t fully do her job? Surely, 
there are other qualified nominees who 
don’t have Ms. Sohn’s conflict of inter-
est. 
But my objections don’t end there. 
While I am concerned about Ms. Sohn 
having to recuse herself from doing 
parts of her job, I am most concerned 
about whether or not Ms. Sohn can do 
any part of her job in a fair and impar-
tial manner. 
Ms. Sohn has a history of virulent 
partisanship and far-left activism, in-
cluding support for such far-left initia-
tives as defunding the police. She has 
publicly expressed her disdain for Re-
publicans, and she has a record of out-
spoken criticism of the very same con-
servative media outlets that she would 
be responsible for regulating. Perhaps 
the most notable example is her hos-
tility towards FOX News, which she 
has referred to as ‘‘state-sponsored 
propaganda’’ and accused of playing a 
role in ‘‘destroying democracy.’’ 
‘‘Destroying democracy.’’ 
And yet we are supposed to believe 
that she would approach cases involv-
ing the FOX corporation impartially? I 
think it is pretty clear that would not 
be the case. 
I don’t expect a Democrat nominee to 
the FCC to agree with Republicans on 
all the issues—far from it. But I do ex-
pect a Democrat nominee to do his or 
her job and do it in an impartial and 
unbiased manner. 
In the case of Ms. Sohn, President 
Biden has nominated someone who can-
not fulfill part of the responsibilities of 
FCC Commissioner and whose record 
strongly suggests that she cannot be 
relied upon to fulfill any of her respon-
sibilities in an impartial manner. 
Americans deserve an FCC nominee 
who can do her job impartially, no 
matter what the matter before the 
Commission. And I hope that if Ms. 
Sohn’s nomination comes to the floor, 
at least some of my Democrat col-
leagues will join Republicans in oppos-
ing her nomination. 
We should all be able to agree that 
virulent partisanship and an inability 
to fulfill the responsibilities of one’s 
job are disqualifying characteristics 
for a role on the FCC. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Ala-
bama. 
PROTECTION OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SPORTS 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, today I want to talk about the 
real March madness that we are having 
this month, moments about basketball 
and the tournament, but I want to talk 
about the madness of attacking title 
IX, attacking women’s sports, and at-
tacking women in general. 
Last night marked the beginning of 
the 2022 NCAA Women’s Swimming and 
Diving Championship. Instead of cele-
brating the many hard-working women 
who earned their spot in the champion-
ship, I expect much of the media atten-
tion to be around a singular compet-
itor—a transgender athlete who com-
peted as a male as recently as 2019. 
But the discussion should not be 
about inclusivity; it should be about 
fairness. I have spoken about this issue 
before and, last March, actually forced 
a vote on the amendment that would 
have prevented Federal funds from 
going to educational institutions that 
allowed biological males to compete in 
women’s athletics. 
Unfortunately, colleagues on the left 
were more interested in pandering to 
the far left than they were in pro-
tecting the ability for girls and women 
to participate in fair—and I repeat, 
fair—competition. They refused to sup-
port my amendment. 
And I would argue that by allowing 
biological males to complete in wom-
en’s athletics, Democrats have set seri-
ous efforts for women’s equality back 
by decades. And, ultimately, this will 
have the effect of discouraging many, 
many, many young women from par-
ticipating in sports. 
In a recent article, two parents of a 
current collegiate athlete said: 
I think the NCAA needs to change its poli-
cies, and find a way to include transgender 
women without trampling all over biological 
women. 
I agree. 
Well, the NCAA has been silent. They 
have failed to take decisive action in 
ensuring a level playing field for all of 
women. 
And so now Congress must act to do 
so. This is why I joined Senator MIKE 
LEE and 16 fellow colleagues in intro-
ducing the Protection of Women and 
Girls in Sports Act of 2021. This is crit-
ical legislation that would make it a 
violation—a violation—of title IX for a 
recipient of related Federal funds to 
permit a biological male from partici-
pating in an athletic program or activ-
ity designated for women and girls. 
The bill would also establish the defi-
nition of ‘‘sex’’ in title IX as based 
‘‘solely on a person’s reproductive biol-
ogy and genetics at birth.’’ 
It is imperative for Congress to act 
so that an entire generation of women 
aren’t discouraged from pursuing their 
athletic dreams, whether on the field, 
whether on the court, or whether in the 
swimming pool. 
As some of the most talented female 
swimmers in the country prepare to 
compete over the next few days, it 
would be wrong not to call out the in-
herent unfairness in allowing a biologi-
cal male to participate in several wom-
en’s events. 
Penn’s transgender athlete will com-
pete in the women’s 100-, 200-, and 500- 
yard freestyle events. Just a few short 
years ago, this athlete was competing 
in men’s collegiate swimming events. 
Since being allowed to switch, this 
swimmer has shattered—and I mean 
completely shattered—records in wom-
en’s events. 
In December, at the Zippy Invita-
tional, this athlete set new national 
and school records in the 1,650-, the

500-, and the 200-yard freestyle events 
and continues to dominate the com-
petition. 
At the invitational, this swimmer 
won the 1,650-yard freestyle with a new 
record time of 15:59.71. The second- 
place swimmer finished 38 seconds 
later. 
At the Ivy League Championships 
last month, this swimmer broke the 
200-yard freestyle record of 1 minute 
and 43 seconds, beating out the last 
record by over a half a second, and the 
pool record was beat by 2 seconds. 
Having been a coach for 40 years, I 
can attest more so than anyone in Con-
gress that there are fundamental dif-
ferences between men and women when 
it comes to sports. But you don’t have 
to take my word for it. A recent study 
concludes that ‘‘on average, males have 
(1) 40–50 percent greater upper limb 
strength, 
(2) 
20–40 
percent 
greater 
lower limb strength, and (3) an average 
of 12 pounds more skeletal muscle mass 
than age-matched females at any given 
body weight.’’ 
Lungs are bigger; heart is bigger. 
Competing in swimming, in the wom-
en’s swimming division, has given this 
Penn athlete an unfair advantage that 
no one else in the field can overcome. 
Some have been too afraid to speak 
up, fearing they will be sacrificed at 
the altar of political correctness, or 
that they will be canceled if they say it 
is unfair for a biological male to com-
pete against a biological female, or 
that they will be shunned if they don’t 
embrace inclusivity over fairness. 
But 
some 
have 
already 
bravely 
voiced their opinion. 
The advocacy organizations Cham-
pion Women and Women’s Sports Pol-
icy Working Group released dual peti-
tions on Tuesday with over 5,000 signa-
tures, 
asking 
for 
policymakers 
to 
prioritize ‘‘fairness and safety for fe-
males’’ instead of ‘‘blanket transgender 
inclusion or exclusion’’ in women’s 
sports. 
The petitions were organized by 
three-time Olympic gold medalist, and 
the 
founder 
of 
Champion 
Women, 
Nancy Hogshead. According to Cham-
pion Women, the petitions were signed 
by 
nearly 
300 
Olympians, 
Paralympians, and U.S. national team 
members, as well as over 2,500 athletes 
who have competed at the high school, 
club, or collegiate levels. 
This is why Congress must act to 
pass the Protection of Women and 
Girls in Sports Act of 2021. 
Allowing biological males to compete 
in 
women’s 
athletics 
threatens— 
threatens—to undo all progress that 
has been made under title IX. 
Title IX has provided women and 
girls the long-denied platform that had 
always been afforded just to men and 
boys. It ensures female athletes had 
the same access to funding, facilities, 
and athletic scholarships. Before title 
IX, female athletes received less than 2 
percent of the college athletic budget— 
only 2 percent—and athletic scholar-
ships for women were virtually non-
existent. 
And since the 1970s, when I first 
started coaching, female participation 
at the college level has risen by more 
than 600 percent. 
So this week, the NCAA champion-
ship will once again emphasize that the 
debate is not limited just to the Halls 
of Congress, but one that we are seeing 
play out across the country. 
It is an undeniable fact that biologi-
cal males have a physiological advan-
tage over females—a fact. So let me be 
clear: The question here is not should 
we be inclusive and supportive of all 
athletes; it is how. 
The first step the Senate can take to 
address the wrong that the NCAA has 
allowed to happen is to pass S. 251. 
There is an attack on women’s 
sports. In the long run, there is an at-
tack on women in this country. It has 
to stop, and it has to stop now. 
So I ask my colleagues to stand up 
for America’s female athletes and 
women all throughout this country and 
support these efforts to preserve wom-
en’s sports. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate consider the following nomination: 
Calendar No. 643, Laura S. H. Holgate, 
to be Representative of the United 
States of America to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, with the rank 
of Ambassador; that the nomination be 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; that any re-
lated statements be printed in the 
Record; that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, the 
Biden administration has failed to 
properly oversee the Pan American 
Health Organization, or PAHO. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Blinken know that PAHO has cooper-
ated with the communist regime in 
Cuba to traffic doctors overseas, and 
they know there are Cuban doctors 
who are trying to sue PAHO and hold 
traffickers accountable. 
Here are the facts. In July 2013, the 
Cuban Ministry of Health signed an 
agreement with the Brazilian Ministry 
of Health to formalize an arrangement 
for Cuban doctors to provide medical 
services in Brazil. 
That agreement required the admin-
istration of former Brazilian President 
Dilma Rousseff to transmit a monthly 
payment through PAHO to the Cuban 
Ministry of Health for the medical 
services provided by each Cuban doctor 
serving in Brazil. 
It also prevented Cuban doctors from 
seeking employment in Brazil outside 
of the formal structure of the arrange-
ment. 
More than 20,000 Cuban medical pro-
fessionals serving in Brazil under the 
Mais Medicos Program had their wages 
stolen by the Cuban Government and 
received only a small fraction of what 
they earned, and that was with the sup-
port of PAHO. 
Their family members were prohib-
ited from accompanying them, and 
many had their passports confiscated. 
Cuban doctors were the only medical 
professionals participating in the pro-
gram who had their salaries directly 
garnished by their government. Mean-
while, doctors from other countries, 
serving in Brazil, received their full 
wages for their medical services. 
Other Cuban doctors have suffered 
similar abuses in Angola, Guatemala, 
Mexico, Qatar, and Venezuela. 
For example, in 2019, a group of 
Cuban doctors reported they had been 
directed and often coerced to use their 
medical services to influence votes in 
favor of the Maduro regime, including 
by denying medical treatment to oppo-
sition supporters and by giving precise 
voting instructions to elderly patients. 
This gross program is a huge money-
maker for the communist thugs ruling 
Cuba. 
In 2018 alone, they pocketed more 
than $6.3 billion from exporting Cuban 
professionals to work overseas. This is 
clearly human trafficking, and medical 
missions by Cuban doctors represent a 
majority of those profits. 
Since I have been in the Senate, since 
2019, I have been fighting for these 
Cuban doctors and against human traf-
ficking. But actually nothing has been 
done to hold PAHO accountable. PAHO 
is hiding behind legal immunity. Presi-
dent Biden has the power to lift their 
immunity, and I have requested his ad-
ministration do so multiple times, but 
they have shamefully declined. It is 
wrong. 
Victims of human trafficking deserve 
to see their alleged abusers in court, 
and PAHO should never be able to hide 
behind claims of immunity to avoid ac-
countability for their role in facili-
tating those abuses. 
I have informed Secretary Blinken 
that until substantial steps toward ful-
filling this request are made, I will be 
blocking all relevant State Depart-
ment nominees. 
Americans 
deserve 
qualified 
and 
competent people in positions of power 
who put American interests first. If 
this administration wants to appease 
dictators like the Castro and Diaz- 
Canel regimes and go to Venezuela and 
try to buy oil, I am going to hold them 
accountable. 
Therefore, Madam President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
appreciate the concerns that my friend 
from Florida has raised. However, I am 
just struggling to see how the safety

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1235 
March 17, 2022 
and security of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear re-
actors, in the midst of the largest reoc-
currence of warfare on the European 
Continent since World War II, has any 
relationship to the issue which he 
raised. 
Russia 
is 
blocking 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency access into 
Ukraine. The proper response by the 
Senate—by the Senator from Florida— 
is not to block our Ambassador to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency 
at a time when Putin, at a time when 
Lavrov, are talking about nuclear 
weapons. 
We need a representative to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
That is what the Senator from Florida 
is blocking right now on the floor—just 
did it. 
All across our country Americans are 
right now wondering, is a nuclear war 
once again possible? What if the Rus-
sians launch a tactical nuclear weapon 
into Ukraine against a nonarticle 5 
country; what is our response? 
They are wondering, does the IAEA 
have access to the 15 Ukrainian nuclear 
powerplants that the Russians, with 
military force, are taking over? 
What are the protections that are 
going to be put in place in order to en-
sure that we, in fact, have done every-
thing that we can do to avoid a nuclear 
accident, either a nuclear weapon or a 
nuclear powerplant accident? 
That is where we are right now, and 
what I hear from the Senator from 
Florida is a disposition on a subject 
completely unrelated to those issues, 
as Americans are all tuned in on a 
daily basis in a way that they have not 
since 1962 to the very real potential 
that there could be a nuclear ex-
change—nuclear weapons exchange— 
between Russia and the West. 
So, from my perspective, this is a 
historic moment that we have to come 
together in a bipartisan way to provide 
a response—a response to Russia, a re-
sponse to their allies—that we are 
deadly serious. Instead, what the Sen-
ator from Florida has done is to arrive 
to object to the confirmation of Laura 
Holgate so that she can be there. 
She is fully qualified. She is an all- 
star in her knowledge of all of these 
issues, but she won’t be on duty. She 
won’t be there with our allies, with the 
technical experts on all nuclear issues, 
because of this objection which we just 
heard. 
From my perspective, we are at a 
pretty big turning point here. We need 
to be talking to everyone. We are ei-
ther going to know each other or we 
are going to exterminate each other. 
That is the point in time at which we 
are at. We are either going to talk to 
each other or we could potentially slip 
into an accidental nuclear catastrophe 
that historians and future generations 
of young people will look back and say: 
How did that happen? 
Well, one of the reasons why it can 
happen is we can’t even get an Amer-
ican to be confirmed by the Senate at 
this time of great crisis because of an 
objection from the Republican Party. I 
mean, partisanship should stop at the 
water’s edge, but when you are talking 
about nuclear weapons, there shouldn’t 
even be a discussion about it. We 
should just let this highly qualified 
woman get on the job to use her exper-
tise in defense of our country and in 
defense of everyone on the planet be-
cause this could quickly—quickly— 
trigger accidents that escalate, and 
then the unimaginable could happen. 
So that is where we are right now. 
We need an ambassador to draw atten-
tion to the danger of Russian forces, 
especially holding Ukraine’s nuclear 
operations at gunpoint. We need an 
ambassador to demand that Russia ac-
cept the IAEA’s offer to establish a 
presence in Ukraine to ensure the con-
tinued safe operation of Ukraine’s nu-
clear facilities. 
Russia knows from the aftermath of 
the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the 
worst in history, that deadly radio-
active fallout does not respect borders. 
And we need an ambassador at the 
IAEA to perform a wide array of duties 
outside of the Ukraine crisis, from 
keeping nonnuclear weapon countries 
nonnuclear and making sure that this 
doesn’t trigger attempts by other coun-
tries to gain access to nuclear mate-
rials and then nuclear weapons. And we 
have to make sure, ultimately, that we 
confirm Laura Holgate. 
First, she served the same role in the 
Obama administration. She hits the 
ground 
running. 
She 
knows 
these 
issues. Second, she is a protege of Sen-
ator Sam Nunn and Senator Richard 
Lugar, and like that legendary bipar-
tisan duo, she has devoted her career to 
dismantling weapons of mass destruc-
tion and materials that could be used 
by terrorists as dirty bombs. 
So how is it that we still don’t have 
an ambassador seated at the Inter-
national 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency’s 
meetings on Ukraine, given this body 
unanimously 
confirmed 
Ambassador 
Holgate in December to be our rep-
resentative to the other U.N. organiza-
tions based in Vienna? 
That is a good question and it has no 
good answer and we did not hear that 
answer on floor of the U.S. Senate just 
5 minutes ago, when the Senator from 
Florida objected. We didn’t hear a word 
about their objections. 
I will tell you what, they are cre-
ating very risky conditions for all 
Americans when they deny our country 
a seat at the table at the International 
Atomic Energy Agency at this time in 
history. 
I was the same age as the pages on 
the floor today when the Cuban missile 
crisis cast a shadow over our Nation. I 
remember what that was like. 
We are slipping day by day into a sit-
uation where we could be confronted 
with similar conditions, and the least 
that we should be able to say is we 
tried, we really tried, to avoid that nu-
clear catastrophe. And the minimum 
that we should do is have an ambas-
sador who is at the table who is talking 
to all of our allies and the rest of the 
world about these issues right now. 
Ukraine and the whole of Europe 
averted disaster when a Russian muni-
tion fell just short of Ukraine’s nuclear 
reactors just a couple of weeks ago. We 
may not be so lucky the next time if 
Russian forces move on the country’s 
other facilities with the same reckless 
abandon. 
What possible benefit is derived from 
keeping our ambassadorial post at the 
IAEA unfilled at a time like this? We 
make nuclear safety and nuclear secu-
rity a partisan issue at our own peril 
and at the peril of every family in our 
country as well as Europe. 
It is just absolutely irresponsible, for 
unrelated reasons, to deny our country 
that kind of protection right now. 
So we are going to keep coming back 
with this, and the reason we are is that 
we can see a continued escalation. We 
can see, in Putin’s own words, reckless 
intent. And it is not for us to judge 
whether he is sincere or not in terms of 
his consideration of the use of nuclear 
weapons or his lack of full consider-
ation of what the consequences are of 
having armed attacks on nuclear pow-
erplant facilities all over Ukraine. 
We can’t get inside of his brain, but 
the least we can do is have someone go 
to the table from America, someone 
who has dedicated her life—Ambas-
sador Holgate—to this work. 
That is what happened here on the 
floor right now. It was a partisan 
politicization of nuclear proliferation, 
of nuclear safety, at a time where we 
are seeing a peril that we have not seen 
in 50 years in the United States or the 
planet. 
All I can tell you is history will not 
come back and well receive the par-
tisan objection for the completely un-
related reasons for not allowing us to 
have that kind of representation at the 
nuclear table at this particular point 
in time. 
I intend to return on this subject, as 
many times as it takes, so that we can 
have someone who is there protecting 
every family in our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UKRAINE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since 
Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, 
we have all been inspired by the cour-
age and leadership of Ukrainian Presi-
dent Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

tally attacked his country, President

S1236 
March 17, 2022 
Zelenskyy did not do as others have 
done in the past. He didn’t run; he 
didn’t hide; and he didn’t give in. Presi-
dent Zelenskyy did what every leader 
hopes to have the courage to do in 
times of crisis: He stood his ground, 
spoke out, and rallied the rest of the 
world to get behind him. 
Yesterday, as we all know, Members 
of Congress had a chance to hear di-
rectly from President Zelenskyy. 
First, he expressed his gratitude to 
the United States for the support we 
have provided so far to his country, but 
he also issued an urgent plea for more 
defense articles. He showed us a video-
tape of devastating photos and videos 
coming out of Ukraine, demonstrating 
what the Ukrainian people are being 
subjected to every day by Putin’s cruel 
and unprovoked war against innocent 
civilians. 
Ukrainian troops need more arms. 
They need anti-tank capabilities, and 
they need additional aircraft. As Presi-
dent Zelenskyy put it, the destiny of 
Ukraine is being decided now, as we 
speak. 
I believe we have a moral obliga-
tion—not necessarily a treaty obliga-
tion since Ukraine isn’t part of NATO, 
but we have a moral obligation as the 
leader of the free world—and I am talk-
ing about the United States as a 
whole—to support Ukraine and help 
them defend their sovereignty and 
their people. 
For example, Poland, a member of 
NATO, offered to transfer an entire 
fleet of MiG–29 fighters to the United 
States for delivery to Ukraine. Ukrain-
ian forces already know how to fly 
those Russian aircraft, and President 
Zelenskyy assured us that they are 
desperately needed, but the Biden ad-
ministration rejected the offer out of 
fear that it might provoke Mr. Putin 
or, in terms of war, might escalate the 
conflict. 
Winston 
Churchill, 
another 
great 
wartime leader, aptly said: 
An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, 
hoping it will eat him last. 
This cannot be the policy of the 
United States. We cannot appease 
Vladimir Putin, and we can’t afford to 
be timid in the face of the greatest 
threat to world peace since World War 
II. 
Here on the Senate floor, several 
weeks ago, I shared a maxim of another 
Russian leader, Vladimir Lenin, the 
leader of the Soviet Union, of course, 
at the time. This is something I would 
suspect that Mr. Putin agrees with. 
Lenin said: 
You probe with bayonets. If you find mush, 
you push. If you find steel, you withdraw. 
In short, if people like Vladimir 
Lenin and Vladimir Putin are met with 
weakness, they are going to keep com-
ing; if they are met with strength, they 
may withdraw. 
President Putin clearly subscribes to 
this world view. He doesn’t respect 
weakness. In fact, weakness is a provo-
cation; it encourages him. A weak op-
ponent is Putin’s greatest desire. Presi-
dent Biden, unfortunately, in not act-
ing more forcefully and taking the ini-
tiative as only leaders can do, is play-
ing into his hand. 
The Biden administration has time 
and time again eventually come around 
to doing the right thing when it comes 
to arming the Ukrainians. Unfortu-
nately, it has only been after there has 
been a public outcry or more pressure 
from Congress or President Zelenskyy. 
Last year, President Biden waived 
sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line. This, of course, is a natural gas 
pipeline that goes from Russia to Ger-
many. One of the things, even now, the 
Germans have recognized is their vul-
nerability to the monopoly that Russia 
has when it comes to providing oil and 
gas to Europe. 
As 
Russia 
built 
up 
troops 
on 
Ukraine’s border, President Biden sug-
gested that some attacks on Ukrainian 
sovereignty would be ‘‘minor intru-
sions’’ and perhaps disregarded by the 
United States, he implied. 
President Biden ignored the advice of 
virtually all of his advisers and missed 
the window to impose paralyzing sanc-
tions on Russia before the invasion, 
and now the administration continues 
to refuse to facilitate the transfer of 
these Polish fighter jets. 
In standard fashion, the administra-
tion seems to be a little confused by 
this crisis—afraid to say yes and too 
afraid to say no. 
I am reminded of President Obama’s 
statement of ‘‘leading from behind,’’ 
which appears to be an approach em-
braced now by President Biden. 
Strong words are important, but they 
don’t defend against rockets or cruise 
missiles. Sanctions are important, but 
they won’t take out a Russian tank. 
Humanitarian aid is important, but 
only if it is delivered on a timely basis 
and when it is needed. And waiting and 
seeing what will develop next and then 
responding after the fact rather than 
anticipating the need is not particu-
larly effective. 
As I said, I believe we have a moral 
obligation to stand with Ukraine and 
help its people defend their way of life. 
We should not be in a position of tell-
ing President Zelenskyy: Yes, you have 
asked us for these defensive arms. You 
have asked us for these airplanes. We 
are going to give you just what we 
think you need. 
I don’t think that should be our posi-
tion. 
We 
ought 
to 
ask 
President 
Zelenskyy what he needs and provide it 
forthwith. 
We want to help Ukraine defeat Rus-
sian forces and repel them from their 
territory entirely, not just extend the 
length of this terrible war. The most 
effective way to do that is to supply 
Ukraine with the assets they need as 
quickly as possible. 
To start with, the Biden administra-
tion should reevaluate its decision to 
reject Poland’s aircraft offer. These 
airplanes are needed for Ukraine to 
maintain air superiority over Russian 
forces, and they need them now and 
not at some distant date in the future. 
And we need to continue to find ways 
to put American weaponry into the 
hands of Ukrainian soldiers. 
Back in World War II, the United 
States was known as the arsenal of de-
mocracy. Again, in a bill that I have 
introduced called the Ukraine Democ-
racy Defense Lend-Lease Act, we can 
do that again. I am proud to have 
worked with a group of bipartisan Sen-
ators, 
including 
Senators 
CARDIN, 
WICKER, and SHAHEEN, to produce this 
legislation. 
This legislation authorizes the Presi-
dent to enter into lend-lease agree-
ments like we did in World War II, 
which probably saved Britain from 
domination by Nazi Germany. We can 
do this again by providing Ukrainian 
forces with the weapons they need to 
defend their country. 
This legislation was included in var-
ious packages designed to support 
Ukraine, 
but, 
unfortunately, 
those 
packages never made their way to the 
Senate floor. 
There is broad bipartisan support for 
this lend-lease provision, and it will 
give the United States the ability to 
send the exact type of military support 
Ukraine needs without a lot of redtape 
or unnecessary delays. 
Our support for Ukraine is not a 
provocation for Putin. It is a necessary 
show of strength, and it is a deter-
rence. 
As we search for additional ways to 
support Ukraine, it was great to hear 
from President Zelenskyy. As I said 
earlier, his bravery and leadership have 
galvanized the world and have inspired 
all of us to take action. And I hope his 
plea for additional aid will persuade 
President Biden to act with even great-
er dispatch. 
This weekend, I will be traveling 
with a number of our colleagues to Po-
land to visit our friends and allies on 
the ground and to see for ourselves the 
sort 
of 
humanitarian 
crisis 
that 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has cre-
ated. 
Poland, to its credit, has welcomed 
thousands 
of 
refugees—hundreds 
of 
thousands—and continues to deal with 
the Russian aggression along its bor-
ders. 
I look forward to this opportunity to 
visit both Poland and Germany and 
learning more from our partners in Eu-
rope and eager to bring back their 
input to the Senate for further urgent 
action. 
I yield the floor.

AMERICA COMPETES ACT OF 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
an announcement to make for the in-
formation of Senators. In a few mo-
ments, I will take the next procedural 
step to advance the jobs and competi-
tiveness legislation so important to so 
many of us in this Chamber. 
Last summer, the Senate passed an 
overwhelmingly bipartisan bill that 
will bring manufacturing jobs back to 
America, fix supply chains, fuel sci-
entific research, and ultimately lower 
costs by a significant amount. The bi-
partisan bill will be great news for our 
economy, 
our 
entrepreneurs, 
our 
innovators, and especially families who 
are feeling the sting because of the 
chip shortage. 
We all know the chip shortage is 
hurting so many people. It is hurting 
the auto industry that has had to tem-
porarily shut down factories. It has 
hurt our tech industry, our healthcare 
industry, and so many others. So let’s 
solve this quickly. 
In order to go to conference, the Sen-
ate needs to amend the House-passed 
COMPETES 
bill 
with 
the 
Senate- 
passed U.S. Innovation and Competi-
tion Act and send it back to the House. 
That is what we will aim to do next 
week as quickly as we can. 
Again, this jobs and supply chains 
legislation will help lower costs. Let us 
have bipartisan cooperation on this 
bill. Now, despite cloture, it is far bet-
ter for Democrats and Republicans to 
reach an agreement to vote on this bill 
quickly, and we will keep working on 
that over the next few days. 
It is regrettable that a small band of 
Republicans are determined to stand in 
the way of quick action after all the 
good work we have done in recent 
weeks passing bipartisan legislation. 
Let’s add to that tally by quickly pass-
ing this bill. Creating jobs, lowering 
costs, 
and 
fixing 
supply 
chains 
shouldn’t be partisan, and I hope to see 
an agreement to expedite this process 
soon. In the meantime, the process is 
moving forward.

Rosen, Ron Wyden, Margaret Wood 
Hassan, Maria Cantwell. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the mandatory quorum call 
for the cloture motion filed today, 
March 17, be waived and that following

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
America’s inflation crisis. People in 
my home State are noticing it every 
day. 
This morning, the majority leader 
came to the floor and expressed his 
shock that prices have gone up, but 
they have been going up for over a year 
now. Price increases last year on en-
ergy alone cost hard-working families 
over $1,000 more last year—the first 
year that Joe Biden was President— 
compared to the previous year. This 
year, it is going to cost even more for 
energy—to drive, to heat, all of those 
things. 
So I am glad that the Democrats now 
are—14 months into Joe Biden’s Presi-
dency—finally concerned about energy 
prices, but what we are seeing the 
Democrats offer are gimmicks. 
Some Democrats want to call it a gas 
tax holiday. Of course, the gas tax is 
what is used to pay for our roads and 
bridges. So they want to defund—stop 
paying for roads and bridges but then 
put the gas tax back on right after the 
election. It is a cynical ploy. 
Other Democrats say: No, no, let’s 
not do that. Let’s just send everybody 
more government checks. 
Well, the Democrats have been doing 
that, and it is what has caused much of 
the inflation that we are facing today. 
Still other Democrats say: No, no, 
no, let’s clamp down on American en-
ergy even tighter. 
These are nice sound bites. We are 
seeing them. We are hearing them. 
Those aren’t solutions. 
We know why prices are rising. 
Prices are rising because supply of 
American energy is down. We are actu-
ally 1.3 million barrels less energy pro-
ducing now with oil in the United 
States than we were before the pan-
demic. So why is supply down? Well, 
the policies of the Democrats in the 
House and the Senate and the policies 
coming out of the White House. Demo-
crats have been in charge of Wash-
ington now for a full year, and high 
prices are really the rotten fruit of 
Democrat rule. 
As I said, we are at 1.3 million barrels 
of oil per day less than before the pan-
demic. People say: Well, what has 
caused it? Joe Biden was proud to talk 
about what has caused it. His first act 
as President was to stop oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands, kill the Key-
stone XL Pipeline, and it is one of his 
campaign promises. You can go back 
and look at the videos of Joe Biden as 
a campaigner saying: I promise you 
there will be no new oil and gas in the 
United States. That is actually what 
the video says, and that is what he 
says. They are his own words, his own 
promises. Then he went back to try to 
clarify that and clean it up a little bit, 
and he said: Well, not on public lands. 
This isn’t a surprise that Biden has 
crushed U.S. production of oil and gas. 
This administration still has not held a 
single auction for oil and gas leases on 
Federal lands since the day he has 
taken office. How does that compare to 
other 
administrations? 
Well, 
under 
President Obama, there were more 
than 30 oil and gas lease sales on Fed-
eral lands that had been conducted in 
the auctions in this same period of 
time. 
So has anybody said anything about 
it? Actually, yes. The courts have 
ruled. The courts said the President’s 
executive office on Federal land leases 
is illegal. That is what the courts 
ruled. President Biden thumbed his 
nose at the Federal courts. The Presi-
dent has stubbornly refused to open up 
more Federal lands to American energy 
production, ignoring what the courts 
have said. 
In Western States like Wyoming, 
where half of our land is owned by the 
Federal Government, and controlled, it 
is devastating. Half of Wyoming is Fed-
eral land. We are sitting on a treasure 
trove of American energy. We wouldn’t 
have to be relying on Vladimir Putin 
or we wouldn’t have to be relying on 
Iran or going hat in hand to Venezuela. 
We have it here in America, and we do 
it a lot cleaner than they do in any of 
these foreign countries run by dic-
tators. 
When we keep energy buried in the 
ground, American families get buried 
in costs. 
The White House says we don’t need 
to open up Federal lands, no. The 
White House says there are oil and gas 
leases that are not being used—another 
sound bite. In reality, most of the 
leases that aren’t being used—it is be-
cause they are tied up in Democrat red-
tape or Democrat-run lawsuits. 
There are some that aren’t being 
used because the companies that have 
the leases can’t get the funding to go 
and do the exploration. Why can’t they 
get the funding? It is the cancel cul-
ture of the Democratic Party. We have 
seen it. Joe Biden’s recent nominee to 
the Federal Reserve wrote in the New 
York Times that banks, she said, 
shouldn’t lend money to oil and gas 
companies—shouldn’t 
do 
it, 
period. 
These are businesses that get loans to 
do business, and she said: Nope, none 
for you. A lot of banks listened to her 
because they thought she was going to 
be confirmed. Thankfully, that nomi-
nation has been withdrawn. 
Less investment means less produc-
tion. It results in higher prices. 
This morning, the majority leader, 
standing at that podium over there, 
also said gas prices had gone up ‘‘at a 
time when families are already strug-
gling.’’ Well, why do you think they 
are already struggling? We know why 
they are struggling. It is because of the 
inflation caused by this administration 
and the policies that have been going 
on for a full year even though, month 
after month after month, the President 
of the United States said they would be 
transitory. 
The price of gas has gone up. The 
price of heating in your home has gone 
up. The price of groceries has gone up. 
The price of nearly everything has 
gone up. Over the past year, prices 
have gone up 8 percent. We are at a 40- 
year high of inflation in this country. 
The average family’s income cannot 
keep up with the price increases that 
we have been sustaining since the day 
Joe Biden took office. Just last month, 
some of the price increases were the 
biggest on record: chicken, lunch meat, 
baby food—things that people need to 
buy. 
I am glad to hear that the Democrats 
are finally admitting the crisis is only 
going to get worse. Why do they say it 
is going to get worse? Because the cost 
of producing things has gone up. En-
ergy prices are up; you use energy to 
produce things. The inflation cost for 
producing things now is actually high-
er based on—the price index for produc-
tion is at 10 percent. So that says that 
prices are going to go up because if it 
costs more to produce things, the 
pricetag has to go up. Food costs con-
tinue to go up. Senator FISCHER, my 
colleague, the senior Senator from Ne-
braska, pointed out that fertilizer costs 
have tripled. 
Now Democrats want to make it 
worse. Democrats in the House—not in 
the Senate but Democrats in the 
House—are asking Joe Biden to declare 
a climate emergency and tighten his 
choke hold on American energy pro-
duction. It is going to make inflation 
even worse. 
In 
yesterday’s 
Washington 
Post, 
Larry Summers warned that we might 
face something, I say to the Presiding 
Officer, that you and I remember, 
something from the Jimmy Carter days 
called stagflation. That is where you 
have inflation and stagnation at the 
same time. It is a terrible thing to hap-
pen to an economy. 
The crisis is only going to get worse. 
We need to change course. We need to 
do it now. Stop the reckless spending, 
and above all, unleash American en-
ergy. Don’t be a country that not too 
long ago was asking Russia to produce 
more, asking OPEC to produce more, 
asking Iran to sell us energy, asking 
Venezuela. Produce it here. We have it 
here. Open up these Federal lands. Ap-
prove the drilling permits—the 4,600 
drilling permits that are stuck in 
limbo by this administration. 
American families cannot afford 3 
more years of Joe Biden. 
I yield the floor.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate will now resume legislative session. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
SENATOR PAUL SIMON WATER FOR THE WORLD 
ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was 
fortunate early in my political life to 
meet several people who became my 
heroes and mentors and led me to take 
up public service as my life’s calling. 
The first was a Senator from Illinois 
named Paul Douglas, and I met him 
when I was a college intern in his of-
fice. And he introduced me to a man 
named Paul Simon; Simon, who was a 
Lieutenant Governor in our State, 
State legislator, Congressman, and, ul-
timately, the Senator who preceded me 
in this Senate seat. 
After Paul Simon passed away, I ap-
proached his family and talked about a 
tribute to him, and they basically said: 
Well, you remember Paul. He would 
have been the last person in the world 
who ever wanted a statue and really 
didn’t care much about having any-
thing with his name on it. That just 
wasn’t his approach to politics. 
But I thought to myself there were 
some things that he valued that maybe 
I can try to help in my own way in his 
memory. And one of them was in 2014, 
when I introduced a bill called the Paul 
Simon Water for the World Act. 
Simon had written a book that didn’t 
make the New York Times best seller 
list. It was entitled ‘‘Tapped Out.’’ He 
had a theory many years ago that the 
issue with the 21st century was going 
to be water. And he made a pretty con-
vincing case, and, frankly, the events 
and evidence since then have backed 
him up. 
So this bill, the Paul Simon Water 
for the World Act, was designed to 
build on the success of an earlier effort 
called Paul Simon’s Water for the 
Poor, which had passed 10 years before 
and sought to bring clean water and 
sanitation programs to the world’s 
poorest communities. 
Today, as we mark World Water Day, 
I want to recognize what we have ac-
complished with these two pieces of 
legislation. They have helped provide, 
for the first time, access to clean 
drinking water and sanitation for more 
than 
60 
million 
additional 
people 
around the globe. 
Those successes have also improved 
global health, economic development, 
and educational attainment. And they 
have proven how far just a little Fed-
eral funding invested in the right area 
can go. 
Both of those laws were passed on a 
bipartisan basis, and in recognizing the 
compounding benefits of clean water 
and sanitation, Congress has sustained 
the programs. 
My staff has traveled to countries 
like Kenya, Ghana, Senegal to see 
these programs in action. They have 
shared stories and photos with me 
about schools and villages that, for the 
very first time, have access to clean, 
drinkable water. 
In Ghana, for example, these laws 
have helped fund something called the 
Digni-Loo Program. It has provided 
rural villages with clean, sustainable 
toilets and helped eliminate water-
borne diseases in entire districts of the 
country. 
This World Water Day, I hope we can 
reaffirm our commitment in this Sen-
ate to supporting legislation in the 
name of my friend and mentor, the 
Senator Paul Simon Water for the 
World Act, that will help bring global 
health for years to come. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, in just a few days, 
America’s eyes will turn to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee as we begin the 
process of considering Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson for her nomination to 
the Supreme Court. 
It is going to be a historic moment 
on Monday as Judge Jackson appears 
before the Committee, and gaveling the 
hearing to order as chair of the com-
mittee will rank as one of the highest 
honors of my career in Congress. 
Next week, the American people will 
have a chance to meet Judge Jackson, 
learn 
about 
her, 
her 
professional 
record, and her life experience. But, for 
now, let me briefly share a few things 
that have impressed me the most. 
By now, I am sure, many have heard 
about her experience. Judge Jackson 
has clerked at every level of the Fed-
eral judiciary. Most lawyers would con-
sider a clerkship in any court as an 
achievement that they could brag 
about for years. She served as a clerk 
at every level of the Federal judiciary, 
including the Supreme Court. 
She served in many roles in the 
courtroom as a public defender, a law-
yer in private practice, and a district 
and circuit court judge at the Federal 
level. 
She was confirmed by the Senate 
unanimously to serve on the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission, and she would be 
the first Justice since Thurgood Mar-
shall with considerable defense experi-
ence. 
Her qualifications are exceptional. In 
every role she has held, she has earned 
a 
reputation 
for 
thoughtfulness, 
evenhandedness, and collegiality. 
Just as impressive as Judge Jack-
son’s record is her character and tem-
perament—humble, personable. She has 
dedicated herself to making our legal 
system more understandable and more 
accessible for everyone who came into 
her courtroom. 
Finally, of course, there is the per-
spective that Judge Jackson will bring 
to the High Court. Over the course of 
its history, 115 Justices have served on 
the Supreme Court. If she is confirmed, 
Judge Jackson will be the 116th, but 
she would be the first Supreme Court 
Justice who is the daughter of parents 
who felt the crushing oppression of seg-
regation and the first Justice who has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1240 
March 17, 2022 
represented an indigent as a public de-
fender. 
Judge Jackson comes from a law en-
forcement family and has a deep appre-
ciation for the risk of police officers, 
like her brother and uncles. And I be-
lieve one served in the Baltimore Po-
lice Department. 
Indeed, with Judge Jackson’s con-
firmation, the Supreme Court would 
come closer to fully reflecting the di-
versity of America. 
When Justice Breyer announced his 
retirement, I promised that the process 
for confirming his successor would be 
fair and timely. Well, it has been. For 
instance, the committee sent a bipar-
tisan 
committee 
questionnaire 
to 
Judge Jackson. In response she pro-
vided materials which shed consider-
able light on her record, her accom-
plishments, her writings, and her legal 
reasoning. Notably, this included more 
than 12,000 pages of public records from 
Judge Jackson’s time on the Sen-
tencing Commission. 
The committee also sent a bipartisan 
document request to the Obama Presi-
dential Library. That request sought 
documents relating to Judge Jackson’s 
nomination to both the Sentencing 
Commission and the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Columbia. In 
response to that request, the Obama 
Library produced more than 70,000 
pages of material. 
Additionally, 
Judge 
Jackson 
has 
written hundreds of opinions—almost 
600 now—which provide extensive in-
sight into her legal philosophy. 
In short, the committee has all the 
information it needs to evaluate Judge 
Jackson’s qualifications to sit on the 
Supreme Court. 
We have sent a lot of followup re-
quests for information, too, and she 
has always responded in a timely way. 
So we are going to proceed with her 
hearing come Monday. This process 
will provide committee members an op-
portunity to question Judge Jackson 
to learn more about her approach to ju-
dicial decision making, her views on 
precedent, and her record on and off 
the bench. 
Here is how the hearing is going to 
work. Each member of the committee 
will be allocated 10 minutes to make 
opening statements. Each member will 
have a total of 50 minutes to question 
Judge Jackson. There are 22 members 
on the committee. If you do the math, 
there is plenty of opportunity for ques-
tions to be asked and answered. I ex-
pect it to be a substantive hearing. I 
expect members on both sides of the 
aisle to ask tough but fair questions 
and to give her an appropriate time to 
respond, and I expect that the com-
mittee will diligently perform our role 
in the Senate’s advice and consent 
function. 
When the hearing is complete, I be-
lieve the American public will be keen-
ly aware of just what an outstanding 
nominee Judge Jackson is. I will also 
get to see what I have seen in meeting 
with her personally. She is thoughtful, 
brilliant, kind, and has a good sense of 
humor. 
She has already inspired young peo-
ple across the country—young people 
who are just beginning to discover 
their passion for law. You see, she 
graduated from Miami’s Palmetto Sen-
ior High School, a public high school in 
Pinecrest, FL. Right now, the halls of 
Palmetto High are buzzing with pride 
in anticipation for next week’s hearing. 
One school administrator told my of-
fice that, even though students will be 
out on spring break next week during 
beach season in Florida, many will be 
coming together for a virtual watch 
party as Judge Jackson appears before 
our committee. The administrator said 
that many of these students see them-
selves in Judge Jackson, particularly 
the members of the speech and debate 
team, which Judge Jackson was once a 
member of herself. In fact, Judge Jack-
son has cited her time on the speech 
and debate team as one of the most 
formative experiences of her life. She 
described it as ‘‘the one activity that 
best prepared me for future success.’’ 
Well, today, Judge Jackson is more 
prepared than perhaps anyone to serve 
on the Supreme Court. So to all the 
students at Palmetto High who are fol-
lowing in her footsteps, working long 
hours to hone their rhetorical skills, 
you are on the right track. While 
Judge Jackson may be the first Pal-
metto Panther to serve on the Supreme 
Court, there is no reason she should be 
the last. Years from now, who knows, 
maybe one of you will be preparing for 
your hearing before the Senate com-
mittee. Until then, you should all be so 
proud of Judge Jackson. 
I would like to add another element 
to this—a personal element. When I 
spoke to Judge Jackson about her fam-
ily, she was naturally proud of her hus-
band, who is a surgeon, but she talked 
about her two daughters and showed 
me pictures of them. They are teen-
agers and obviously good kids. She is 
so proud of them. She told the story 
that when there was a vacancy an-
nounced on the Supreme Court several 
years ago, one of her daughters picked 
up a pen and wrote a personal letter to 
President Obama and said: Why don’t 
you pick my mom? 
It is that kind of support every par-
ent lives for, and I am sure it means a 
lot to her. She is a good person, a good 
mother, a good parent, and she will be 
a great member of the Supreme Court. 
I also want to say that there are ele-
ments that obviously the public has 
paid attention to. This being the fourth 
time before the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, many people in America know 
Judge Jackson or they have heard 
about her or they have read about her. 
They believe in a positive way that she 
will bring diversity to the Court; that 
she has the experience that is nec-
essary to serve effectively; that she 
will uphold our constitutional values of 
liberty, equality, and justice; and that 
she will protect the constitutional 
rights of everybody, not just the 
wealthy and powerful. She has ethics 
and integrity, and she will place justice 
before politics. 
I am looking forward to this hearing. 
I am happy that the Republicans have 
said publicly that they want to make it 
a respectful hearing, and I certainly 
hope they live up to it. I will do every-
thing I can to convince the Democratic 
side to aspire to the same goal. This 
can be a historic moment for America 
in the selection of this Justice. I hope 
the Senate Judiciary Committee rises 
to the occasion, and I have confidence 
that it will. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATIONS OF CRISTINA SILVA AND ANNE 
TRAUM 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the nominations of 
Judge Cristina Silva and Professor 
Anne Traum, nominees to serve on the 
U.S. District Court for the District of 
Nevada. Both nominees have built tre-
mendous careers and legal reputations, 
and, last night, cloture was invoked on 
both of these nominees with strong bi-
partisan support. 
Judge Silva has spent the bulk of her 
career as a Federal prosecutor in the 
city of Las Vegas, where she served as 
chief of the criminal division. In this 
role, Judge Silva oversaw all criminal 
investigations and prosecutions in the 
Nevada U.S. Attorney’s Office. She has 
gained vast experience dealing with 
Federal criminal trials, including vio-
lent criminal cases, civil rights viola-
tions, and cyber crime. 
Since 2019, Judge Silva has served 
with distinction as a Nevada State 
court judge, where she has earned the 
respect and admiration of her col-
leagues, as well as those who have ap-
peared before her in court. Colleagues 
have called her ‘‘intellectually gifted 
and extremely hard-working’’ and have 
commended her ‘‘deep commitment to 
the rule of law.’’ 
These are exactly the kinds of quali-
ties we need in someone nominated to 
serve on the Federal Bench, and they 
are the qualities that Judge Silva ex-
emplifies. I know she will serve with 
independence and integrity. 
For her part, Professor Anne Traum 
has also developed a distinguished 
legal career, one rich with examples of 
her commitment to the law and to pub-
lic service. She has litigated civil cases 
with the U.S. Attorney’s office, served 
as a Department of Justice trial attor-
ney, and has worked for years on crimi-
nal cases as a Federal public defender. 
Since 2008, Professor Traum has dedi-
cated her career to helping shape the 
minds of Nevada’s future lawyers as a 
professor at the University of Nevada 
Las Vegas’s Boyd School of Law. 
A deeply admired teacher, Professor 
Traum has gone above and beyond, 
founding a clinic to provide legal serv-
ices to parties in Las Vegas who lack 
resources and volunteering significant 
time to pro bono programs in Southern 
Nevada. Professor Anne Traum has

worked to ensure that all individuals 
have adequate representation to defend 
their rights and that all individuals 
have access to our justice system. 
And there is no better way to judge a 
professor than by the opinion of her 
students. In Professor Traum’s case, 
her 
students 
regularly 
credit 
her 
courses as the most important courses 
in their legal careers. 
The 
bipartisan 
judicial 
selection 
committee that Senator CATHERINE 
CORTEZ MASTO and I put together fully 
vetted both of these nominees, and we 
both worked hand in hand with the 
White House to ensure that they were 
chosen for their exemplary qualifica-
tions, intellect, and passion for the 
law. 
I was glad to see that both Professor 
Traum’s and Judge Silva’s nominations 
received bipartisan support—both as 
they advanced through the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee and during last 
night’s cloture vote. These highly 
qualified nominees for the U.S. district 
court are fully deserving of your sup-
port now, and I urge each of my col-
leagues to vote for their confirmation 
next week. 
Nevada’s Federal district court has 
been 
under 
enormous 
strain, 
with 
delays driving up the costs to busi-
nesses and individuals pursuing their 
claims in court. Filling the vacancies 
with these nominees would ensure that 
Nevadans have fair and reasonable ac-
cess to the Federal courts. 
It is time to confirm these nominees, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
in favor of Judge Cristina Silva and 
Professor Anne Traum. 
I yield the floor.

PROXY WARS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
one of the challenges we face in this 
era of great power competition is iden-
tifying unique threats before they esca-
late. 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine, these threats have come into 
full focus. Vladimir Putin took off his 
statesman costume and declared a war 
of choice on Ukraine. Last week, we re-
ceived the first public allegations of 
his intent to unleash Syrian proxies on 
anyone still standing between his war 
machine and the territory he covets. 
I am glad to hear more of my col-
leagues speaking up about the unique 
dangers of proxy wars. Last week, I 
laid out in detail how Putin has used 
proxies to install himself in countries 
that are leadership poor but resource 
rich. 
We know that fighters from the 
Kremlin-backed Wagner Group have 
slaughtered their way through Africa 
and the Middle East on behalf of 
Putin’s grand Soviet ambition. And 
now he is going to do the very same 
thing in Ukraine. 
We have also seen Iran unleash prox-
ies and State-sponsored terror organi-
zations 
in 
Iraq, 
against 
American 
Armed Forces and against civilian pop-
ulations in Lebanon, Yemen, and Gaza. 
In their 2022 threat assessment, the 
intelligence community stated: 
We assess that Iran will threaten U.S. per-
sons directly and via proxy attacks, particu-
larly in the Middle East. 
This is a public statement. This is 
the Annual Threat Assessment. It is 
backed by years of evidence, proving 
that Iran has done this before and they 
are going to try to do it again. 
President Biden should be doing ev-
erything in his power to keep this 
threat as far away from American citi-
zens as he can—but no such luck. The 
impending nuclear deal he is trying to 
hand Tehran unlocks billions of dollars 
for Iranian banks, companies, and 
other entities that finance violence. 
Where does the White House think 
that money will end up? 
We know there is nothing Tehran 
loves more than a power vacuum. They 
have invested heavily in Hezbollah, the 
Houthis, and Hamas—all terrorist or-
ganizations hunkered down in some of 
the world’s most unstable regions. Over 
the past decade, the Iranians have 
spent more than $16 million on care-
fully 
targeted 
bloodshed. 
That 
is 
right—Iran alone, the largest state 
sponsor of terrorism. 
The landscape is chaos, and, still, the 
Biden administration is pushing the 
world toward a sanctions relief scheme 
that would empower the Iranians to 
terrorize and subjugate even more peo-
ple. 
The regime in Tehran is a menace. 
This week, incoming CENTCOM com-
mander, General Kurilla, said as much 
in his confirmation hearing when we 
asked him how sanctions relief would 
affect the Iranian influence. 
I am quoting him: 
[T]here is a risk with sanctions relief that 
Iran would use some of that money to sup-
port its proxies and terrorism in the region, 
and if it did, it could increase risk to our 
forces in the region. 
In this week’s CENTCOM posture re-
view before the Armed Services Com-
mittee, outgoing commander, General 
McKenzie, acknowledged these con-
cerns about sanctions relief, saying: 
[T]here is a risk that they could use that 
money in ways that we would not want them 
to use that money. 
That is right. We certainly don’t 
want them to put one more penny to-
ward these proxy wars, for good rea-
sons. 
First, proxies don’t just parachute in 
and declare victory. They brutalize en-
tire populations and use weapons that 
these hostile regimes wouldn’t nor-
mally have access to. 
Second, because proxies operate out-
side the law, the rogue regimes that 
hire 
them 
maintain 
plausible 
deniability. 
Third, this plausible deniability cre-
ates a false sense of security that al-
lows hostile governments to pull up a 
chair to the negotiating table and pre-
tend to fit in with normal countries, 
all the while denying the United States 
access and placement. 
We have a limited number of ways to 
deter hostile regimes from waging war 
on the civilized world. The West failed 
the people of Ukraine in this regard, 
but it is not too late to change course. 
Ronald Reagan once said: 
[W]ar comes not when the forces of free-
dom are strong, but when they are weak. It 
is then that tyrants are tempted. 
He 
believed 
in 
achieving 
peace 
through strength, and so do I. 
It is pretty simple. If you don’t stand 
up for yourself, you will get run over, 
and if you don’t stand up for your 
friends, there may not be anyone left 
to help them when the wolves are actu-
ally at the door. 
When I talk to Tennesseans about 
this, the one thing they want to know 
is why President Biden makes deci-
sions that make this country more vul-
nerable and less safe. Whether through 
lifting sanctions on Iran, slow-walking 
sanctions on Russia, or keeping our 
economy entangled with China’s, Biden 
has refused to lead. Forget doing what 
needs to be done; he won’t even say 
what needs to be said. He is fearful. He 
is scared to anger the new Axis of Evil. 
He is scared to anger our more timid 
allies in Europe. He is scared to anger 
the radical left here at home. 
Is there anything that he is not 
afraid of? 
He is so weak-kneed in the face of ad-
versity that he can’t even bring him-
self to finish building the fence that 
would secure our southern border. 
I want to focus on that border secu-
rity for just a few minutes because, 
while Russia and Iran might dominate 
headlines, for Tennesseans, our wide- 
open southern border is a perfect exam-
ple of what can happen when a Presi-
dent concedes national security to 
score points on his political rivals. 
Border encounters were up 2 percent 
in February. That is almost 165,000 peo-
ple trying to enter the country unno-
ticed; 76 percent of the people the Bor-
der Patrol caught were single adults; 
cocaine seizures increased 83 percent; 
meth, 97 percent; heroin, 173 percent. 
We know for a fact that terrorists 
and members of international criminal 
organizations cross our border with im-
punity. Over the course of 3 days last 
December, the Border Patrol arrested a 
guerrilla member of the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia, four MS–13 
gang members, and an 18th Street gang 
member—six—six—distinguished 
rep-
resentatives from the most dangerous 
gangs in the entire world and they al-
most disappeared into the country un-
detected. Thank goodness for law en-
forcement because these are not ordi-
nary criminals. 
In January of 2021, the Department of 
Justice indicted the 14 most senior 
members of MS–13 on charges of con-
spiracy to support, finance, and com-
mit acts of terrorism. 
Is this the Biden doctrine—choosing 
vulnerability over security and annihi-
lation through weakness? 
Who exactly does the President in-
tend to win over with this approach? 
Ukraine will find no peace in the eas-
ing of diplomatic tensions on some

U.N. panel. Children in Africa won’t 
have a future if we start writing checks 
to proxy fighters. The people of El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, and Honduras won’t 
be better off if we enable the drug deal-
ers and sex traffickers who make a liv-
ing exploiting their families. No mat-
ter where in the world you look, you 
can see the costs of Joe Biden’s willful 
blindness to danger. 
He has the tools he needs to protect 
the United States from these threats. 
Now, he needs to use them. 
It is time to stop relying on foreign 
oil and make the country energy inde-
pendent again: Finish the Keystone 
Pipeline. Do an Operation Warp Speed 
for energy. Allow oil and gas explo-
ration on Federal land. 
We have to stop leading from behind 
when it comes to preventing Iran from 
obtaining nuclear weapons. 
President Biden must submit to Con-
gress any deal with Iran; and rest as-
sured, we will block the implementa-
tion of anything the White House tries 
to sneak under the radar. We must pay 
attention to the flow of money and 
power in proxy hotbeds and recognize 
the danger posed by these terrorists for 
hire. We can’t neglect security threats 
close to home. It is time to secure the 
border and give our law enforcement 
officials the resources they need to 
catch terrorists and gang members be-
fore they disappear into the country. 
Tennesseans can’t identify with the 
President’s refusal to lead. They are 
confused and frightened, but they also 
have faith in our ability as a country 
to pull out of this skid. They believe in 
the promise of America. All they want 
is for their President and elected lead-
ers to prove that they also believe in 
this country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ
MASTO). The Senator from Ne-
braska. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, I want 
to talk about three things. 
First, Ukraine. 
What do they need? How much aid? 
What kind, and how urgently can and 
should we get it to them? 
Second, omnis. 
Does the way the Congress spends 
money make any sense right now? 
And, third, political grandstanding. 
In particular, can politicians resist 
the short-term political crack that is 
social media? 
First, Ukraine. 
How much aid do they need? What 
kind and how urgently? The answer is 
they need everything, and they need it 
yesterday. 
If they can shoot it, we should ship 
it. Ukrainians are fighting for freedom, 
and we should be doing more to help: 
Javelins, Stingers, lethal drones like 
Switchblades, surface-to-air missiles 
like the S–300s, coastal defense mis-
siles, machine guns, ammo, grenade 
launchers, night vision goggles, and, 
yes, planes—more and more of them 
faster. 
I applaud the President for some of 
what he has done, for sending some of 
this, but I would also note that there 
are really important weapons that are 
not yet in Ukrainian hands, like the S– 
300s. 
I would also note that it takes time 
to cross the border, and we should be 
sending this stuff as fast as possible, 
not having the administration’s law-
yers debate how many angels can dance 
on the tip of a SAM or debate which 
weapons should be considered offensive 
versus defensive. 
Look, the Ukrainians are the people 
who are being victimized; they are the 
people who have been invaded. Every 
weapon we give them right now is a de-
fensive weapon. It is Russia that has 
invaded Ukraine, and these lawyerly 
distinctions don’t really make a bit of 
difference to a Russian invading pilot. 
If he gets shot down, which weapons 
system it came from is not really the 
concern he is going to have at that mo-
ment. 
So the answer to the question ‘‘What 
kind of aid does Ukraine need?’’ is 
more and faster. 
Second, omnis. 
Does the way the Congress works 
right now—does the way that we man-
age the power of the purse, does the 
way the appropriations process works— 
make any sense? 
Can any of us go home and explain it 
to our constituents as the cautious, 
careful, prudent, adult management of 
the FISC? Obviously not. This process 
doesn’t work. 
I am 50 years old, and in the last 46 
years—I think the current number is 
four times in the last 46 years that the 
Congress has spent at least 30 percent 
of its money under regular order on a 
regular 
appropriations 
process—four 
times in 46 years. This doesn’t make 
sense. It is not prudent. It doesn’t 
work. 
For weeks, I have been calling on the 
President and his administration to 
submit an emergency supplemental to 
Congress so we can send Ukraine all of 
the aid they need faster. 
Look, I am a fiscal hawk, but I am 
also a defense hawk, a security hawk, 
and I am A-OK with our spending a 
bunch of money fighting for the de-
fense of freedom as long as the Ukrain-
ians have fight in them. They are fight-
ing not just for their kids and their fu-
ture; they are fighting for free peoples. 
Putin will not be stopped until some-
one stops him. So the Ukrainians are 
doing a service to us—they are willing 
to fight. We should be willing to fund 
and to resupply them. 
The reality is that my calls for an 
emergency supplemental were ignored. 
The administration didn’t make any 
emergency supplemental request. The 
Congress’s hands are not guilt-free ei-
ther. We didn’t even vote on an aid 
package for the Ukrainians until more 
than 2 weeks after the invasion. 
Why the wait? 
Washington did what it always does 
and decided it would just add the de-
fense money to the orgy of spending 
and pet projects and bureaucracy—that 
we spend every year—in the middle of 
the night in a thousands-and-thou-
sands-paged bill that not a single Mem-
ber who voted on it here had actually 
read. 
So what did we do with the Ukrain-
ian aid? 
The reality is there was some impor-
tant aid in the omni, but we should 
talk about how much it was. We spent 
$13 billion on Ukrainian aid out of a 
total appropriations package of $1.5 
trillion. For those of you doing math 
at home, that is less than 1 percent of 
what we passed in the middle of the 
night last week that was actually 
Ukrainian aid. 
Here is a depiction: This is the aid 
bill, and this tiny, little subpiece of 1 
percent is the portion that was Ukrain-
ian aid. 
The reality is that the bill we voted 
on last week wasn’t really about 
Ukrainian aid. Ukrainian aid was a lit-
tle bit of sugar on the larger medicine 
of a $1.5 trillion bill that nobody would 
actually want to go home and defend to 
the voters and to the taxpayers of 
America was well thought out. 
So why does this happen? 
Well, the American people aren’t stu-
pid. A lot of politicians think voters 
are stupid. They think you can jingle a 
shiny thing over here and then make 
up any claim you want, but the reality 
is voters aren’t stupid. Voters are dis-
tracted, and they are busy, but they 
are not unaware of what is happening 
here. 
They know why politicians talk like 
this—why they say that if you didn’t 
vote for a $1.5 trillion bill, you were 
against puppies; you were against food 
for children; and you were against all 
of these really great ‘‘mom and apple 
pie’’ kinds of things when the reality is 
you probably voted against the bill be-
cause there was a whole bunch of 
schlock in it that was unvetted, not be-
cause you said: Hey, I don’t want the 
Ukrainian freedom fighters to have the 
military aid that they need. People 
talk like this so that they can bully 
the other side. 
This is, quite frankly, a boring 
speech. It is not a speech that I want to 
be giving. But the truth is, if you allow 
liars to constantly lie, and they can 
get away with it, then they just keep 
doing it. So it is probably useful for us 
more often to take people’s nonsense 
tweets, which they do for a bizarre au-
dience of political weirdoes on Twitter, 
and they should have to defend these 
statements in public. 
It is transparently obvious that if 
you vote against a $1.5 trillion bill, 
that doesn’t mean you were trying to 
vote against everything particularly in 
it; that you were against those kinds of 
funding. It might be because you were 
against lots of things in it that are in-
defensible before the voters. It is trans-
parently stupid, and the voters get it. 
So to the question of do omnis make 
sense? The answer is, no, we should do 
better.

March 17, 2022 
But the question that our Republic is 
partly going to have to resolve if we 
are going to get healthy again as a pol-
ity is, Will politicians be able to resist 
the short-term crack of social media? 
It doesn’t look like very many of us 
in this body are interested in trying to 
speak to 70 and 75 and 80 percent of the 
electorate, but rather that lots and 
lots 
of 
politicians 
are 
completely 
happy to speak to the very narrow 
range of fan service that they do on 
Twitter. 
Many politicians are addicted to 
Twitter. They want their sick burns 
and their retweets and their likes. It is 
crack and they have an addiction and 
it is sad. 
The truth is that the folks who do 
this kind of garbage are hopelessly out 
of touch with the reality of the peo-
ple’s lives that we are actually sup-
posed to be serving. It is not useful to 
drink your own bath water. 
Twitter isn’t real life, so it is prob-
ably useful for us to pause more often 
and try to make sure we have some 
common facts about the connection be-
tween political Twitter and reality. 
First, only 20 percent of Americans 
are on Twitter—19 or 20 percent of 
Americans are on Twitter. Political 
Twitter is something like the ninth 
most 
watched 
portion 
of 
Twitter; 
sports Twitter, a foretaste of Heaven, 
unlike political Twitter, a foretaste of 
Hell. Sports Twitter is much bigger 
than 
political 
Twitter. 
Hollywood 
Twitter is bigger than political Twit-
ter. K-pop Twitter is much, much big-
ger than political Twitter. So let’s just 
start by recognizing that only 20 per-
cent of Americans are on Twitter, and 
politics isn’t a top five subportion of 
Twitter. 
Of those who are on Twitter, only 
about 40 percent say they ever use 
Twitter for politics. But for the small 
minority of Americans who do pay at-
tention to political Twitter—again, 40 
percent of 20 percent—if you are doing 
math at home, we are now in single 
digits here. So 40 percent of 20 percent 
is 8 percent of Americans. For those 
who do pay attention to political Twit-
ter, the political tweets are dominated 
by a very, very, very, very small share 
of American adults. Something like 80 
percent of all tweets come from 10 per-
cent of Twitter users. But this is the 
audience that politicians are playing 
for when they grandstand on Twitter. 
Let’s be clear, this happens all over 
the political continuum. This isn’t 
chiefly on the right or chiefly on the 
left. 
If you ever wonder why are politi-
cians such weirdoes, it is mostly be-
cause they are grandstanding for a 
very, very narrow niche audience of 
weirdoes on Twitter, and so we should 
actually ask if it is healthy to continue 
doing that. 
So to our core questions, the Ukrain-
ians, do they need aid? Yes, they do. 
We should fund freedom fighters. 
To the question of do omnis work? 
No, they don’t, and everybody knows 
it. 
But to the question of should we con-
tinue doing political discourse like 
this? Should we say that someone who 
had concerns about this was trying to 
kill off babies and puppies? No, we 
shouldn’t lie like this. We shouldn’t do 
that. 
We owe the voters better than that. 
We should tell the truth, and we should 
try to talk to voters like you are actu-
ally talking to a room of regular people 
who have jobs and who are actually 
trying to put bread on the table for 
their kids and probably are pretty 
grateful for the inheritance that is the 
American Republic and our leadership 
on the global stage for freedom lovers. 
The Ukrainians are that. We should 
fund the Ukrainians. We should have 
funded them in a more prudent way 
than an omni. 
But if you voted for an omni when I 
voted against it, I am not going to at-
tack you for voting for the omni. But 
don’t go out there and lie and pretend 
that somebody who voted against the 
omni was against all the stuff in it, 
some of which is pretty decent. 
We can do better. We should. 
Thank you.

REMEMBERING SONNY RUNDELL 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
this afternoon here among my col-
leagues and those back home in Kansas 
to pay tribute to a Kansan, Sonny 
Rundell. 
Sonny passed away this past Friday 
at the age of 89, and I want to take a 
moment to recognize his life and his 
service. A moment is insufficient, cer-
tainly, to pay the tribute that this gen-
tleman and his family deserve. 
Sonny was born in Pierceville, KS, a 
little town in Southwest Kansas. In 
places as rural as Pierceville, people 
are sparse, and so you quickly learn 
what is important. And Sonny learned 
that in his life, family, church, commu-
nity were the important things. 
Sonny embodied qualities that fos-
tered his community: hard work and 
generosity. And like so many young 
men of his generation, he was called to 
service to his country. In 1953, he an-
swered that call and left to serve in 
Korea. 
When he returned home to Kansas in 
1956, he finished his degree at Kansas 
State University, earning a degree in 
agriculture. He went on to farm land in 
Hamilton, Stanton, and Finney Coun-
ties for more than 30 years. 
Sonny was involved in so many ways. 
He was a churchgoer, and he cared 
about education advocacy throughout 
our State. He was a member of the 
State board of education and was an 
advocate for education for all kids in 
our State. 
He had preceded that by being a 
member of the Syracuse, KS, Board of 
Education, the High Plains Special 
Education 
Cooperative. 
He 
was 
a 
founding member of Garden City Com-
munity College Board of Trustees, a 
founding member of the Education Eq-
uity Advisory Council, the Education 
Commission of the States, the Kansas 
Commission on Teaching and Amer-
ica’s Future, and the National Associa-
tion of State Boards of Education, and 
that is only to name a few. 
Sonny recognized, as I hope we all do, 
that education is the great equalizing 
opportunity for Americans, for Kan-
sans. It allows us to pursue what we 
call the American dream. 
He received lots of recognitions dur-
ing his life. He received those for his 
advocacy, and in 2003 Sonny was 
awarded the Governor’s Award for Dis-
tinguished Service to Secondary Edu-
cation in Kansas. 
From 2000 to 2003, our country recog-
nized 50 years since the Korean war. 
And during this time, the Republic of 
Korea issued a service medal and 
awarded those to veterans who had 
served, 
coordinating 
with 
congres-
sional offices like mine. I was pleased 
to be able to recognize Sonny’s service 
to our Nation. 
Particularly in these troubled times, 
these days in which we see the surge 
for support for freedom, Sonny com-
mitted to doing so and served his Na-
tion and the world in that cause of 
freedom. 
In 2002, while I was still a Member of 
the House of Representatives here in 
the Nation’s Capitol, I was pleased to 
be able to honor Sonny for his recogni-
tion during the Korean war. 
Then and now, I thank him for his 
dedication to our State, and I thank 
him for his service to our Nation. 
My prayers are with his wife Verna 
and to his entire family and loved ones. 
Robba joins me in expressing our sin-
cere condolences and wish those who 
remain to look at the life of Sonny 
Rundell and recommit ourselves to 
service to our community, to our fam-
ily, and to our church. 
REMEMBERING DICK HEDGES 
Madam President, this afternoon I 
rise to pay tribute to a Kansan, a 
champion of the Fort Scott commu-
nity, Dick Hedges. 
In Kansas, we talk often of commu-
nity and how important it is to the fab-
ric of small towns that dot the State. 
There are small towns in Southwest 
Kansas, and there are small towns in 
Southeast Kansas because in Kansas, 
those communities matter so much. We 
grew up knowing our neighbors and 
making the effort to get involved with 
those 
around 
us 
that 
ensure 
our 
smalltown survival. 
Dick Hedges was a man who took 
that need for a strong community to 
heart and helped build the fabric of 
Fort Scott in so, so many ways. 
Last night, I was reading the Fort 
Scott Tribune, and I read an article in 
tribute to Dick. Its headline read: 
‘‘Man who shared so much is remem-
bered.’’ It is a pretty good headline to 
have upon your death, ‘‘shared so 
much.’’ 
Dick was a coach, a teacher, a vice 
principal, a principal, a college presi-
dent; he was a member of the commu-
nity civic clubs and a churchgoer; he

served on local boards; he wrote for 
local papers; and he championed the 
arts in and around Fort Scott. 
In 2018, he even opened a local book 
store because the community needed 
one. He was a man who shared so much 
of himself: his time, his love, his expe-
rience, his loyalty, and his commit-
ment to others. 
He was an advocate for athletics and 
sportsmanship and the way it could in-
fluence young students in a positive 
way. For 40 years, he shared his life 
with purpose and continually found 
new ways to do so. 
But to Dick, I expect that was his 
definition of ‘‘community,’’ sharing 
oneself for the betterment of others 
with the expectation that they, too— 
the people whom you help—may pay it 
forward. 
Dick has impacted the lives of so 
many, so many throughout his life, and 
his life gives me hope for others like 
him in towns across Kansas and around 
the country. 
My prayers are with his wife Jan, the 
Fort Scott community, and his entire 
family and loved ones. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
got the chance to hear some of Senator 
SASSE’s remarks. I noted the floor 
chart with my name on it, accusing me 
of what he called tribal hackery. 
I am not exactly sure what the rules 
of the Senate are. I am not sure that 
that is becoming of the U.S. Senate to 
use those terms about fellow Members, 
but let me come down to the floor to 
explain why I think we should have a 
legitimate debate in this Chamber 
about a phenomenon in which Repub-
licans very often are not willing to cast 
their vote in a way that is aligned with 
their voice. 
Yes, I noted this morning—as was 
displayed on Senator SASSE’s chart— 
that this week, of the Republicans who 
stood up at a press conference and evis-
cerated President Biden’s handling of 
the Ukraine crisis, two-thirds of them 
voted against the budget that included 
$14 billion of aid to Ukraine. I see a 
fundamental inconsistency in criti-
cizing an administration for not doing 
enough but then not being willing to 
cast a vote to get aid to the people of 
Ukraine. 
Senator SASSE’s second chart—the 
one that didn’t accuse me of tribal 
hackery—laid out a very true state-
ment, in which a small percentage of 
the overall budget is dedicated to 
Ukraine aid. That is, of course, true. 
But the reason why I find it con-
cerning that Members of the Senate 
who, I take their word for it, are genu-
inely interested in getting help to the 
people of Ukraine are then voting 
against the budget that delivers it, is 
because it speaks to a broader problem 
in the Senate today, which is a lack of 
interest in compromise, a lack of inter-
est in finding a result—a fealty to the 
perfect and an antagonism to the good. 
Mr. SASSE. Would the Senator yield? 
Mr. MURPHY. Sure, I would be happy 
to yield. 
Senator SASSE, I was going to try to 
respond to your critique, but I am 
happy to yield at this point. 
Mr. SASSE. So let me just see if I un-
derstand what you just said. 
Eight-tenths of 1 percent of the bill 
that was passed in the middle of the 
night last week is about Ukraine aid. 
Do you believe that the people who 
voted against it voted against it be-
cause they were against Ukrainian aid? 
Mr. MURPHY. So every one of us ap-
proaches a big— 
Mr. SASSE. I am asking a really sim-
ple question: Do you think a single per-
son that your Twitter self-pleasuring 
was for—do you think a single person 
that voted against it voted against it 
because they were against Ukrainian 
aid? 
Mr. MURPHY. Absolutely not. 
Mr. SASSE. So, then, what is the 
point of the tweet? 
Mr. MURPHY. The point is that the 
only way that this place passes legisla-
tion is compromise, is voting on pieces 
of legislation that have in it things 
that—— 
Mr. SASSE. What are the pieces, 
dude? It is $1.5 trillion. 
Mr. MURPHY. Senator—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would 
ask the Senators to direct their ques-
tioning to the President and give the 
Senators the decorum to respond. 
Mr. MURPHY. So inside every piece 
of legislation are elements that many 
of us disagree with, right? Inside that 
budget that you voted against are all 
sorts of things that I disagree with. 
But, in the end, in order to govern the 
country, you have to be able to find a 
path to compromise. 
And what I have found, over the time 
that I have been here, is that there is 
a pathway to getting things done. It 
generally involves 90 to 100 percent of 
Democrats and a small slice of Repub-
licans. It is increasingly hard to find 
compromise that involves more than 10 
or 15 Republicans because, as you 
state, inside these pieces of legislation 
there are things to disagree with, 
right? There are things that you find 
objectionable. 
So while, in the past, I think people 
would set aside some of the things that 
they weren’t happy about in the inter-
est of the greater good, today there 
seems to be a higher bar, and the result 
is that it is just a lot harder to get 
things done. 
Now, on the budget, luckily there 
were enough of us that were willing to 
celebrate the good, as opposed to the 
perfect, in order to get that budget 
passed and significant aid to the 
Ukrainian people across the finish line. 
My worry is that, as time goes on, 
there will be an inability to find those 
coalitions and that we will be stuck in 
a world in which you can’t get Federal 
budgets done, you can’t get big pieces 
of legislation done because there isn’t 
that interest in compromise that is 
necessary sometimes to get passed a 
big package like the one that we passed 
earlier this week. 
Mr. SASSE. When you are willing, if 
I may. 
Mr. MURPHY. Yes, Senator SASSE. 
Mr. SASSE. I think there are three 
topics. Argue with me if I misread the 
three topics before us. 
One is Ukrainian aid. I don’t think 
we differ. And the reason I came to 
make a speech—and you and I have 
talked 
about 
this 
offline 
multiple 
times in the past. Let me name the 
three: One, there is Ukrainian aid. 
Two, there is the budgeting and appro-
priations process. And, three, there is 
the grandstanding that happens for au-
diences that don’t have anything to do 
with persuading a single human being 
that is called to work in this space. 
In bucket one, I think you know that 
not a person who voted against it—the 
omni—voted against it because of the 
Ukrainian aid. So I think it is a dis-
honest argument. 
In bucket two, which—well, I am 
jumping in and you have the floor; so I 
will give it back to you. But, in bucket 
two, you have repeatedly used the term 
‘‘people won’t vote for something be-
cause it is not perfect.’’ I think that, if 
we could put the appropriations proc-
ess of the U.S. Congress up to the 
American people for a referendum, the 
idea that you want to give it a B-plus 
or an A-minus, I submit you should 
take that to the voters of Connecticut 
and try to persuade them of that, be-
cause I am going to guess that, what-
ever the overall approval rating is of 
Congress, it bounces around between 
like 9 and 15 percent. My guess is, the 
way we spend money, it is lower than 
that. So I don’t think you want to give 
yourself an 86 or a 92 or a 95 percent be-
cause it is not perfect. It is obviously 
an F. The way that we spend money 
here is not deliberative; it is not 
thought out. It is always thousands of 
pages that come out in the middle of 
the night, and it always votes. 
So to your point, that you said budg-
ets pass around here with 50 of 50 
Democrats and 10 or 12 of 50 Repub-
licans, that is true. We do have a philo-
sophical difference about whether or 
not the appropriations process works. 
I think you are the one voting on the 
side that is misaligned with both fiscal 
reality and the role of the American 
people. But I didn’t come to beat you 
up about voting. 
I am supposed to direct it to the 
President. 
Madam President, I don’t think the 
Senator from Connecticut is on the 
floor because I came to attack him for 
voting for the omni. I didn’t. He mis-
represented why some people who 
voted against the omni were dishonest 
by saying they were for more Ukrain-
ian aid when there was Ukrainian aid 
in this budget. 
But the real thing we are talking 
about is grandstanding, because there 
is not a person on Earth who is per-
suaded by that kind of tweet. You

didn’t move anybody. You are doing 
fan service for a subset of people who 
like CHRIS MURPHY. I get why some 
people would like things that you 
stand for and advocate for. I get it. 
But there is not a person who dis-
agreed with you who is moved because 
of a tweet like that. There is not an 
uninformed American who became in-
formed. But there is a subset of the 
people who already like you that you 
got to grandstand for. That is all that 
happened with that tweet. The Repub-
lic got dumber because of that tweet. 
Nobody learned anything. 
Mr. MURPHY. Reclaiming my time. 
Listen, I understand that Republicans 
would love for this inconvenient truth 
not to be pointed out for them— 
right?—the fact that they are evis-
cerating the President at press con-
ferences for the crisis in Ukraine. 
There were Members at that press con-
ference that Senator SASSE attended 
that said, if not for President Biden, 
this invasion would have never hap-
pened; that it was his fault. 
Mr. SASSE. Not my view. 
Mr. MURPHY. That might not have 
come from Senator SASSE’s mouth, but 
there were others at that press con-
ference—right?—who have repeatedly 
blamed this entire crisis not on Vladi-
mir Putin but on Joe Biden’s policies. 
And I do think it is convenient for Re-
publicans to consistently eviscerate 
the President for his conduct but then 
not be willing to cast the difficult 
votes necessary to help the President 
effectuate a policy there. 
The consequence of a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
that budget, whether you like it or not, 
was that assistance money not getting 
to Ukraine. There wasn’t another vote 
in front of us. The only choice that this 
Senate had was, Do we support a piece 
of legislation that includes necessary 
money—— 
Mr. SASSE. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is out of order. 
Mr. MURPHY. I let the Senator fin-
ish. 
The choice before this Senate was, 
Are we going to support a piece of leg-
islation that includes the necessary 
money in order to allow for Ukraine to 
defend itself and for this administra-
tion to get emergency resources, or are 
we going to vote it down? 
And I understand that the American 
public are rightly upset about the way 
in which we budget. But, on that day, 
there was one choice before this body. 
So I do see that there is an inherent 
contradiction 
between 
Republicans 
standing 
up 
at 
press 
conferences, 
which, frankly, are speaking most 
often to the same audience that you 
believe that my tweets are speaking to, 
right? Most often, these press con-
ferences are designed to rally the faith-
ful. 
So I think it is a bit sanctimonious 
to suggest that only one of us in this 
Chamber is involved in preaching to 
the choir. Much of the engagement in 
press conferences here, around this 
issue of Ukraine, ends up speaking to 
base audiences, and the message being 
sent to that audience is that President 
Biden isn’t doing enough. 
And then, when we had an oppor-
tunity to pass bipartisan legislation to 
give him the tools to do more, the 
same Republicans that were at that 
press conference criticizing the Presi-
dent decided—and, I submit to you, for 
legitimate reasons having nothing to 
do with the Ukraine money—to cast a 
vote that had the consequence, if it 
was the majority position in this body, 
to disapprove of that money, to reject 
that money. 
Mr. SASSE. Will the Senator yield? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would 
the Senator yield his time—— 
Mr. MURPHY. I would. 
Mr. SASSE. I would direct a ques-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER.—for a 
question? 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
And I would ask both Senators to di-
rect their remarks to the President, 
please. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, I 
would ask the Senator from Con-
necticut to explain to me why the only 
choice was $1.5 trillion or zero. The 
Senate could work its will and have 
passed the $13.6 billion of aid money 10 
minutes later. 
Madam President, could the Senator 
from Connecticut explain to me this 
apparent—to me, false—choice between 
$1.5 trillion and zero. Why were there 
no other options? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Connecticut wish to re-
spond to the question? 
Mr. MURPHY. I will. Thank you, 
Madam President. 
The Senator is exactly right. Not 
only was there another option—pass 
the Ukraine supplemental on its own— 
there were a million other options. 
Right? There are always different ways 
that we can do things, and that is al-
ways a reason to vote no. 
I could always choose to vote no on a 
measure before us because I can dream 
up of a scenario in which the outcome 
would be better aligned with my prior-
ities. I think that is a very convenient 
reason to defend a ‘‘no’’ vote: that 
there is a theoretical outcome that 
would be more in alignment with your 
beliefs. 
That is not how things work here, 
right? We are presented with pieces of 
legislation we all have input into. This 
was not a Democratic bill. This was a 
bill worked out with many Republicans 
as well. And ultimately we had a 
choice. We had a choice. 
And, again, I think it is a lot easier 
to just come down here to vote no on 
everything. But when life and death 
are at stake in a place like Ukraine, I 
think, on the willingness to support a 
piece of legislation that maybe has 
some things in it you don’t like, the 
bar may be a little bit higher. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Connecticut yield his 
time for a question? 
Mr. MURPHY. I don’t think I have 
anybody seeking to yield at this point. 
Let me say this. I take Senator 
SASSE’s position seriously, and I want 
him to take my position seriously, as 
well, because I object to the idea of my 
effort to draw attention to the fact 
that Republicans voted against a bill 
that includes significant money for 
Ukraine as political hackery. I object 
to that characterization because I do 
think I am speaking to a broader trend 
line in this body, in which it is seem-
ingly harder than ever to get both sides 
to the table to agree to big things that 
change people’s lives or change reali-
ties overseas. 
I think Senator SASSE makes an im-
portant point, which is the way we are 
doing things right now with respect to 
the budget is insanity. I agree with 
that. The lack of transparency, the 
fact that all of this work is shopped to 
the majority and the minority lead-
ers—that is not good for government; 
that is not good for transparency. I 
think there are legitimate reasons why 
Members of this body would vote 
against the budget. 
But that is not what my statement 
was about. It was about trying to jux-
tapose that vote to this criticism of 
the President. I do think those two 
things are relevant because the Amer-
ican public is being given the impres-
sion by many Republicans that the 
President isn’t being serious enough 
about this crisis or isn’t working hard 
enough at this crisis. 
And I do think it is legitimate to put 
on the table for a discussion the fact 
that the very people who are criticizing 
the President’s conduct are often not 
willing to support the funding nec-
essary for him to carry out that mis-
sion—for reasons that have nothing to 
do with Ukraine but have, in the end, 
the effect of denying the President, if 
this position was the majority—it was 
not last week—given that the con-
sequence of voting down the budget 
would have been to ultimately deny 
that funding to the President and to 
the people of Ukraine. 
I think this is a legitimate topic for 
discussion, and I will continue to raise 
it. I will take the Senator’s word seri-
ously and try to raise it in a way that 
is constructive, but I think this is a le-
gitimate topic for discussion in the 
U.S. Senate. 
This is not about rallying the base. 
This is about trying to promote a dis-
cussion about how we make this place 
more functional and how these press 
conferences that Republicans are doing 
end up having some connection to the 
reality of the votes that happen on the 
floor of the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, in the 
interest of comity, I will underscore 
three points of agreement from Sen-
ator MURPHY’s last few minutes there, 
as well, just as a way to close us out. 
No. 1, I agree with the Senator that 
there is a lot of grandstanding all over

political theater right now, and that 
certainly includes people on my side of 
the aisle who have tried to imply that 
pieces of this are President Biden’s 
fault that aren’t President Biden’s 
fault; that the evildoer here is Vladi-
mir Putin, who is targeting women and 
children; and Americans should be on 
the same team against that evil. 
So to the degree that the Senator is 
partly motivated by frustration with 
some grandstanding that he has seen 
by people who have an ‘‘R’’ behind 
their name, I agree. 
Second point: I am for this funding, 
and my criticism of the Biden adminis-
tration has not been because they 
wouldn’t support funding. In the intel 
space, there are a whole bunch of argu-
ments and fights we have been having 
that we can’t talk about in this setting 
but where I just want them to go fast-
er. 
But the idea that the problem with 
the administration, from my point of 
view, is an unwillingness to fund—that 
isn’t my position, and so the Senator 
and I are united that that would be an 
unfair criticism of the Biden adminis-
tration. 
And third and finally, he called our 
budgeting and appropriations process 
‘‘insanity.’’ Let’s put a pin in that be-
cause what I was voting against last 
week was not done for the purposes of 
saying 
the 
Ukrainian 
aid 
money 
shouldn’t move, but it is saying that an 
insane budget process shouldn’t work 
this way, where the American people 
can’t get access into other monies 
being spent. And we have 12 or 13 sub-
committees of the appropriations proc-
ess, and we almost never get to vote 
bill by bill. 
I would gladly have us stay here 24/7 
for 2, 3, 4 weeks—however long it took. 
And if we had to cast not just 12 or 13 
subcommittee approps packages, but if 
we had to vote on hundreds or thou-
sands of things item by item—it is a 
pretty clunky process but a much bet-
ter process than we have right now, 
which the Senator from Connecticut 
rightly described is ‘‘insane.’’ On that 
we agree. Thank you for engaging. 
I yield the floor.

SAFE CONNECTIONS ACT OF 2021 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 193, S. 120. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 120) to prevent and respond to the 
misuse of communications services that fa-
cilitates domestic violence and other crimes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation, with an amendment to strike 
all after the enacting clause and insert 
in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Connec-
tions Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, 
terms used in this Act that are defined in section 
344(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
added by section 4 of this Act, have the mean-
ings given those terms in such section 344(a). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Domestic violence, dating violence, stalk-
ing, sexual assault, human trafficking, and re-
lated crimes are life-threatening issues and have 
lasting and harmful effects on individuals, fami-
lies, and entire communities. 
(2) Survivors often lack meaningful support 
and options when establishing independence 
from an abuser, including barriers such as fi-
nancial insecurity and limited access to reliable 
communications tools to maintain essential con-
nections with family, social safety networks, 
employers, and support services. 
(3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse de-
scribed in paragraph (1) increasingly use tech-
nological and communications tools to exercise 
control over, monitor, and abuse their victims. 
(4) Communications law can play a public in-
terest role in the promotion of safety, life, and 
property with respect to the types of violence 
and abuse described in paragraph (1). For exam-
ple, independent access to a wireless phone plan 
can assist survivors in establishing security and 
autonomy. 
(5) Safeguards within communications services 
can serve a role in preventing abuse and nar-
rowing the digital divide experienced by sur-
vivors of abuse. 
SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS 
WITHIN 
COMMUNICA-
TIONS SERVICES. 
Part I of title III of the Communications Act 
of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by add-
ing at the end the following:

SEC. 7. SAVINGS CLAUSE. 
Nothing in this Act or the amendments made

f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate will consider 12 out-
standing 
judicial 
nominees. 
These 
nominees represent the continued ef-
forts of President Biden and Senate 
Democrats to bring much-needed pro-
fessional and demographic diversity to 
the Federal bench. 
This latest lineup of nominees in-
clude legal academics, public defend-
ers, civil rights lawyers, sitting State 
and Federal judges, prosecutors, and 
private practitioners. Each of these 
nominees has the character, tempera-
ment, and qualifications to serve with 
distinction. 
The first nominee is Judge Jac-
queline Corley, nominated to the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern Dis-
trict of California. 
For more than a decade, Judge 
Corley has served as a Federal mag-
istrate judge in the Northern District 
of California. She has handled cases 
implicating a variety of complex statu-
tory and constitutional questions, from 
immigration to employment to na-
tional security matters. And in her 
time on the bench, she has amassed a 
record that reflects her evenhanded, 
impartial approach to the law. Earlier 
in her career, Judge Corley spent near-
ly two decades working in private legal 
practice and as a career law clerk to 
Judge Charles Breyer, who also serves 
on the Northern District of California. 
Judge Corley received a unanimous 
rating of ‘‘Well Qualified’’ from the 
American Bar Association, has the 
strong support of Senators FEINSTEIN 
and 
PADILLA, 
and 
received 
over-
whelming bipartisan support in the Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Next, we have Fred Slaughter, who 
has been nominated to serve on the 
U.S. District Court for the Central Dis-
trict of California. 
Judge Slaughter currently serves as 
a judge on the California Superior 
Court for Orange County. In 2014, Gov-
ernor Jerry Brown appointed him to 
this position, and since then, Judge 
Slaughter has presided over a wide va-
riety of cases, including civil cases, fel-
ony criminal cases, and juvenile justice 
proceedings. After graduating from the 
UCLA School of Law, he started his ca-
reer as a deputy city attorney with the 
Los Angeles City Attorney’s office, be-
fore moving to the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice for the Central District of Cali-
fornia as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. 
He prosecuted a wide range of cases 
and developed a deep understanding of 
the district to which he has been nomi-
nated. 
Judge Slaughter has the strong sup-
port of both his home-State Senators, 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN and Mr. PADILLA, and 
he was rated unanimously ‘‘Well Quali-
fied’’ by the American Bar Association. 
His deep commitment to public service, 
coupled with his broad experience, 
makes him an excellent nominee to the 
Federal bench. 
The Senate will also consider the 
nomination of Ruth Montenegro to the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of California. 
Since 2018, Judge Montenegro has 
served as a U.S. magistrate judge in 
the Southern District of California. 
Prior to that, she served as a State 
court judge. With her combined experi-
ence on federal and State courts, Judge 
Montenegro has been on the bench for 
nearly 8 years. She has presided over 
thousands of cases, including more 
than 30 jury trials and over 100 bench 
trials. 
Judge Montenegro was unanimously 
rated ‘‘Qualified’’ by the American Bar

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1249 
March 17, 2022 
Association, and both Senators FEIN-
STEIN and PADILLA strongly support her 
nomination. 
A 
graduate 
of 
UCLA 
School of Law, Judge Montenegro 
worked as an attorney for more than 19 
years before assuming the bench. 
Judge Montenegro is also the child of 
immigrants and a first-generation col-
lege graduate. Throughout her career, 
she has made it a priority to give back 
to the community. In 2018, she served 
as chair of the California Bar Founda-
tion’s scholarship committee, and, for 
many years, she served as president 
and chair of the scholarships com-
mittee for the El Centro Education 
Foundation. 
Judge Montenegro was voted out of 
the Judiciary Committee with bipar-
tisan support. I urge my colleagues to 
support her nomination. 
Next is Victoria Calvert, nominated 
to be a judge on the U.S. District Court 
for the Northern District of Georgia. 
Ms. Calvert is a highly experienced liti-
gator with a proven commitment to en-
suring equal justice for all. 
Ms. Calvert attended Duke Univer-
sity and received her law degree from 
the New York University School of 
Law. She then spent 6 years working in 
private practice before dedicating her 
career to public service. Currently, she 
serves as a staff attorney with the Fed-
eral defender program in the Northern 
District of Georgia, a position she has 
held since 2012. In this role, she has 
represented hundreds of indigent cli-
ents. Ms. Calvert has the strong sup-
port of her home-State Senators, Mr. 
OSSOFF and Mr. WARNOCK. And she re-
ceived a unanimous ‘‘Well Qualified’’ 
rating from the ABA. 
I have said many times that public 
defenders are vastly underrepresented 
on our Nation’s courts, and I believe 
that Ms. Calvert will bring a valuable 
perspective to the bench, including an 
appreciation for the real world impact 
of judicial decisionmaking. 
We also will be considering the nomi-
nation of Julie Rubin, who has been se-
lected to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Maryland. 
For the past 8 years, she has served 
as an associate judge on the Circuit 
Court for Baltimore City. In this role, 
Judge Rubin has presided over nearly 
950 civil and criminal cases that have 
gone to verdict or judgment, including 
122 jury trials. 
Prior to assuming the bench, Judge 
Rubin spent 15 years litigating in pri-
vate practice and tried 17 cases to ver-
dict or judgment. She also rose to be-
come the vice president of her firm. 
Judge 
Rubin 
received 
her 
under-
graduate degree from Mount Holyoke 
College and her law degree from the 
University of Maryland School of Law. 
And she received a unanimous ‘‘Well 
Qualified’’ rating from the American 
Bar Association. 
Judge Rubin has the strong support 
of her home State Senators, Mr. 
CARDIN and Mr. VAN HOLLEN. She also 
received bipartisan support in the Judi-
ciary Committee. As a native Mary-
lander with a wealth of trial experience 
on and off the bench, Judge Rubin will 
make an excellent addition to the Dis-
trict Court. 
Next we have Hector Gonzalez, nomi-
nated to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of New 
York. 
Mr. Gonzalez is an accomplished liti-
gator. Over the course of his career, he 
has tried more than 20 civil and crimi-
nal cases, the majority of them as chief 
counsel. Mr. Gonzalez served as a pros-
ecutor for almost 10 years, serving in 
both the Manhattan District Attor-
ney’s Office as well as the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York. In addition to the crimi-
nal law expertise he developed as a 
prosecutor, 
Mr. 
Gonzalez 
has 
also 
gained considerable civil litigation ex-
perience, managing complex litigation 
matters involving bankruptcy, anti-
trust, and professional liability. 
In recognition of his long career as 
an accomplished litigator, Mr. Gon-
zalez was inducted as a fellow into the 
American College of Trial Lawyers. 
The 
ABA 
found 
him 
unanimously 
‘‘Well Qualified.’’ In addition, he has 
the strong support of Senators SCHU-
MER and GILLIBRAND. 
Next we have John Chun, who has 
been nominated to serve on the U.S. 
District Court for the Western District 
of Washington. 
Judge Chun has served on Wash-
ington State courts for the past 7 
years, first as a judge on the King 
County Superior Court and currently 
as a judge on the Washington Court of 
Appeals. Throughout his time on the 
bench, he has presided over 90 civil and 
criminal cases that have gone to ver-
dict or judgment. These cases have 
been almost evenly split between jury 
and bench trials. 
Prior to his judicial appointment, 
Judge Chun spent 10 years as a com-
mercial and employment litigation at-
torney. Practicing in both Federal and 
State court, he tried five cases to ver-
dict or judgment and became partner 
at his firm in just 6 years. Judge Chun 
received his undergraduate degree from 
Columbia University and his law de-
gree from Cornell Law School. He then 
began his legal career by clerking for 
the Honorable Eugene A. Wright on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
Judge Chun has the strong support of 
Senators MURRAY and CANTWELL. He 
received a bipartisan vote in the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. He also re-
ceived a unanimous ‘‘Well Qualified’’ 
rating from the American Bar Associa-
tion. Judge Chun’s demonstrable com-
mitment to justice and the rule of law 
will serve him well as a district court 
judge. 
Next is Sarah Geraghty, nominated 
to the U.S. District Court for the 
Northern District of Georgia. 
Since 2003, Ms. Geraghty has been an 
attorney at the Southern Center for 
Human Rights, where she has advo-
cated for the fair and equal treatment 
of people in the criminal legal system, 
regardless of their ability to afford 
counsel. Ms. Geraghty has approxi-
mately 20 years of litigation experi-
ence, during which time she has han-
dled every stage of the legal process, 
from pretrial investigations to briefing 
and arguing appeals. 
Ms. Geraghty has been widely recog-
nized for her work. In 2020, she was 
named Attorney of the Year by Geor-
gia’s primary legal publication, the 
Fulton County ‘‘Daily Report’’. In 2017, 
Emory University School of Law’s pub-
lic 
interest 
committee 
gave 
Ms. 
Geraghty its Unsung Devotion to Those 
Most in Need Award. Ms. Geraghty was 
rated ‘‘Qualified’’ by the American Bar 
Association, and both Senator OSSOFF 
and Senator WARNOCK strongly support 
her nomination. 
In addition to her legal practice, Ms. 
Geraghty is a lecturer at Emory Law 
School and a part-time instructor at 
Georgia State University College of 
Law. Ms. Geraghty has received numer-
ous letters of support, including from 
law enforcement officials and attor-
neys who have opposed her in litiga-
tion. These letters demonstrate that 
Ms. Geraghty’s approach to resolving 
legal disputes has always been, as one 
letter put it,‘‘collaborative rather than 
confrontational.’’ Another letter stated 
that she has always ‘‘approached con-
flicts between the parties with flexi-
bility and an open mind.’’ These quali-
ties will serve her well on the bench. 
Ms. Geraghty received bipartisan sup-
port in the Judiciary Committee. I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
her nomination. 
We 
will 
also 
consider 
Georgette 
Castner, who has been nominated to 
serve on the U.S. District Court for the 
District of New Jersey. 
She is an experienced litigator with a 
deep knowledge of the District of New 
Jersey. A graduate of the College of 
New Jersey and Rutgers Law School, 
Ms. Castner has spent almost 15 years 
in private practice, representing a 
range of individual and corporate cli-
ents. Over the course of her career, she 
has litigated matters spanning various 
areas of civil and criminal law. 
Ms. Castner received a ‘‘Qualified’’ 
rating from the ABA and has the 
strong support of her home-State Sen-
ators, Mr. BOOKER and Mr. MENENDEZ. 
Next is Judge Cristina Silva, nomi-
nated to the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Nevada. 
Judge Silva currently serves on Ne-
vada’s Eighth Judicial District Court, 
where she handles a mix of civil and 
criminal proceedings. In her time on 
the bench, Judge Silva has presided 
over 15 trials, the vast majority of 
which were jury trials. She has also re-
mained active in the local legal com-
munity, including through service on 
the board of directors of the Nevada 
Latino Bar Association. 
Before her appointment to the bench, 
Judge Silva served as both a local and 
Federal prosecutor. She helped lead the 
domestic violence unit of the Miami-

Dade State’s Attorney’s Office and 
then served for nearly a decade as an 
Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District 
of Nevada, ultimately becoming the 
chief of that office’s criminal division. 
Judge Silva received a unanimous rat-
ing of ‘‘Well Qualified’’ from the ABA 
and has the strong support of Senators 
CORTEZ MASTO and ROSEN. 
We also will be considering the nomi-
nation of Anne Traum, who has like-
wise been chosen to serve on the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Ne-
vada. 
Professor Traum is currently a pro-
fessor of Law at the University of Ne-
vada, Las Vegas, William S. Boyd 
School of Law, a position she has held 
since 2014, and associate dean for expe-
riential legal education. Her commit-
ment to the university is admirable: 
She founded, and now leads, the appel-
late clinic, which allows students to 
brief and argue cases before the Ninth 
Circuit or the Nevada Supreme Court. 
Additionally, she took 1-year leave of 
absence from the university from 2015 
to 2016 to serve as special counsel with 
the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office 
for Access to Justice. The breadth of 
her career does not stop there, though. 
She was an assistant federal public de-
fender in the Federal public defender’s 
office in Las Vegas from 2002 to 2008 
and, prior to that, served as an Assist-
ant U.S. Attorney in the Civil Division 
of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
District of Nevada from 2000 to 2002. 
Professor Traum has the strong sup-
port of her home-State Senators, Ms. 
CORTEZ MASTO and Ms. ROSEN, and was 
rated ‘‘Well Qualified’’ by the Amer-
ican Bar Association. 
Finally, we will be considering Judge 
Alison Nathan, who has been nomi-
nated to serve on the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
Judge Nathan is an experienced liti-
gator and an accomplished jurist. She 
has served on the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New York 
since 2012. While on the bench, she has 
authored over 1,500 opinions and has 
presided over 45 trials that have gone 
to verdict or judgment. With that long 
record, her reversal rate is an impres-
sive 1 percent. I have no doubt that she 
will be a valuable addition to the Sec-
ond Circuit. After attending Cornell 
University and Cornell Law School, 
Judge Nathan clerked for Judge Betty 
B. Fletcher on the Ninth Circuit and 
for Justice John Paul Stevens of the 
U.S. Supreme Court. From there, she 
began her legal practice, where she spe-
cialized in civil litigation and devel-
oped a large pro bono practice focused 
on LGBTQ rights and appeals for in-
mates on death row. She also held posi-
tions in government and academia. 
Judge Nathan has the strong support 
of Senator SCHUMER and Senator GILLI-
BRAND, and she was unanimously rated 
‘‘Well Qualified’’ by the American Bar 
Association. Her record on the bench is 
deeply impressive. She has proven, 
without a doubt, that she understands 
the difference between a policy advo-
cate and a judge, and I am certain that 
she will continue to administer justice 
in a thoughtful, evenhanded manner. 
I support all of these outstanding 
nominees and encourage my colleagues 
to join me in voting for their confirma-
tion.

TRIBUTE TO RAY DRAKE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Raymond ‘‘Ray’’ Drake for 
his extraordinary service to the United 
Parcel Service, UPS. Earlier this year, 
Ray announced that after 46 years at 
the UPS, including 11 years as vice 
president of UPS State Public Affairs, 
he will be retiring this April. 
Ray has a profound record of service 
to UPS, rising through the ranks and 
serving with a deep sense of loyalty 
and respect. In 1976, Ray was first hired 
at UPS as a package handler while at-
tending the College of New Jersey. 
While balancing his studies, Ray was 
promoted to part-time hub supervisor. 
Upon graduating with a degree in polit-
ical science, he moved to the metro 
New York district to become a package 
car driver. 
Just 2 years after his graduation 
from college, Ray was promoted to a 
full-time management position, joining 
engineering and operations, where he 
spent 35 years of his career. Working in 
engineering and operations, Ray took 
on a number of assignments, holding 
positions in three UPS districts and 
numerous package and air divisions. In 
these roles, Ray utilized his strong 
leadership, technical, and analytical 
skills to develop and deploy oper-
ational practices throughout UPS. For 
the last 11 years, Ray brought his tal-
ents in leadership and advocacy to the 
UPS’s State public affairs team, where 
he worked tirelessly with key policy-
makers in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
Ohio, and Wisconsin. 
In Illinois, Ray has served far beyond 
his responsibilities with the UPS. Ray 
was deeply involved with the State 
chambers of commerce and is the 
former commerce chairman, the only 
UPS manager to chair a State cham-
ber. Ray currently serves on several 
boards and committees, including the 
Illinois Chamber Foundation Board, 
the Chicagoland Chamber Board of Di-
rectors, the Chicagoland Chamber’s 
Public Policy Committee, and the 
Board of Directors of Illinois’ Civic 
Federation. In support of UPS’s inter-
national initiatives, Ray serves on the 
Illinois advisory council for the U.S. 
Global Leadership Coalition and the 
advisory council for North Rhein West-
phalia-Invest, and previously served as 
vice chairman of the Illinois Inter-
national Business Council, an organiza-
tion he helped found. In this role, Ray 
has used his decades of experience in 
transportation and operational leader-
ship to educate and engage community 
leaders on investments in development 
and diplomacy and has used these rela-
tionships to help strengthen Illinois’ 
economy. 
In the true spirit of his own legacy at 
UPS, Ray was a leader in developing 
the wildly successful Chicagoland Re-
gional Education Programs, which has 
allowed thousands of young Illinois 
residents the opportunity to go to col-
lege while working at UPS. 
I want to close by congratulating 
Ray Drake on his distinguished career 
with the UPS and thank him for all he 
has done and all he will continue to do 
to serve communities in Illinois and 
across the world. Chicago is grateful 
for all of his service and sacrifice. Now, 
as he enters the next chapter in his 
life, I want to wish Ray and his family 
the very best in a long and happy re-
tirement.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
United Kingdom—Ballistic Missile Defense 
Radar (BMDR) and Command and Con-
trol Battle Management and Commu-
nications (C2BMC) 
The Government of the United Kingdom 
(UK) has requested to buy one (1) Ballistic 
Missile Defense Radar (BMDR); and two (2) 
Command and Control Battle Management 
and Communications (C2BMC) user nodes 
(with network capability required to connect 
to the C2BMC System to support radar oper-
ations). Also included are design and con-
struction of a combined radar-equipment 
shelter; encryption devices, secure commu-
nication equipment, and other required 
COMSEC equipment to support radar oper-
ations; spare and repair parts, support and 
testing equipment, publications and tech-
nical documentation, personnel training and 
training equipment, U.S. Government and 
contractor engineering, technical and logis-
tics support services, and other related ele-
ments of logistical and program support. The 
total estimated program cost is $700 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a NATO Ally that is a force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in Eu-
rope. 
The proposed sale will improve UK’s abil-
ity to meet current and future ballistic mis-
sile threats to the UK and NATO by improv-
ing the effectiveness of NATO BMD systems. 
The United Kingdom will have no difficulty 
absorbing the BMD Radar into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Moorestown, NJ. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale may 
require the assignment of approximately 15 
U.S. Government and up to 100 contractor 
representatives to the UK, at any given 
time, during the construction, installation, 
integration and testing of the BMDR and 
C2BMC capability. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–10 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The United Kingdom (UK) Ballistic Mis-
sile Defense Radar (BMDR) is a scaled 
version of the U.S. Long Range Discrimina-
tion Radar. It will provide continuous and 
precise tracking and discrimination of mis-
sile threats, persistent long-range midcourse 
discrimination, precision tracking and hit 
assessment. Discrimination is a critical ca-
pability of missile defense, which will pro-
vide data to distinguish lethal objects from 
debris and decoys around the lethal object. 
The UK will use the Command and Control, 
Battle Management, and Communications 
(C2BMC) system to integrate the UK BMDR. 
This will improve the effectiveness of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) mis-
sile defenses. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
United Kingdom can provide substantially 
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S. 
Government. This sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of the 
United Kingdom.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
on March 14, 2022, I was unable to cast 
a vote on rollcall vote No. 79, the mo-
tion to invoke cloture on Executive 
Calendar No. 726, the nomination of 
Shalanda D. Young of Louisiana, to be 
Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget. I was on a bipartisan con-
gressional delegation visit to Poland, 
meeting with refugees displaced by the 
violence caused by the current, illegal 
invasion of Ukraine. 
Had I been present, I would have 
voted yes to proceed with her nomina-
tion as Director of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DAN CNOSSEN 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize a truly incred-
ible and historic individual. 
Dan Cnossen is a textbook definition 
of honor and bravery. His story began 
when he was accepted into the U.S. 
Naval Academy after high school. In 
2003, he completed the grueling process. 
Over the course of the next 6 years, 
Dan was deployed to Iraq and Afghani-
stan where he rose in rank to becoming 
the officer in charge of an 18-man 
SEAL platoon. In 2009, late on a night 
mission in the mountains, Dan stepped 
on an improvised explosive device and 
lost both of his legs. Later, he was 
awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze 
Star with Valor. Over the next 2 years, 
Dan fought for his life. He endured 40 
different 
surgeries, 
while 
simulta-
neously reintroducing himself into ci-
vilian life—neither an easy task on 
their own, but coupled together creates 
one extraordinary obstacle. 
While Dan was in rehab, though, he 
was introduced to the sport of cross- 
country 
skiing 
and 
biathlon. 
Dan 
pushed himself and was dedicated to 
earning 
a 
spot 
in 
the 
2014 
U.S. 
Paralympic Team, leading to an in-
credible—and ongoing—career. In 2018, 
Dan outstandingly won a gold medal, 
four silvers, and one bronze. In addi-
tion to his 2018 medals, he also earned 
the honor of Best Male Athlete of the 
Games. Most recently, at the 2022 Win-
ter Paralympic Games, Dan made his 
country proud once again by winning 
gold in Cross Country Skiing Mixed 
Relay. 
I think his motto ‘‘keep going, keep 
covering ground’’ beautifully sums up 
his journey so far and should serve as 
an inspiration for those who get to 
hear his story. His Paralympic career 
has been remarkable to see, and it is 
with great pride that I get to share 
Kansas as a home to such an out-
standing individual and athlete. I ask 
my colleagues now to join me in recog-
nizing Dan and his unbelievable story.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING SEASONAL SHOPPE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Seasonal 
Shoppe of Salyersville, KY, as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
Bekah Frazier Rudd, owner of Sea-
sonal Shoppe, will tell you herself that 
retail runs in her blood. Bekah inher-
ited her knack for running a business 
from her mother and father, who owned 
Frazier’s Prater Drug Store, the long-
est continuously operating business in 
Salyersville. Bekah’s mother, Patricia 
Frazier, started off with a little corner 
in her husband’s store selling arts and 
crafts items. Throughout the years in 
the drug store, the popularity of 
Patricia’s corner eventually led her to 
start a business of her own, just a few 
doors down from her husband’s phar-
macy. Thus, Seasonal Shoppe was born 
and has been operating since 1997. 
Eight years later, when Patricia left to 
take over Frazier’s Prater Drug Store, 
Bekah stepped in to fill her mother’s 
shoes as owner and operator of Sea-
sonal Shoppe. 
Though Seasonal Shoppe has since 
shifted towards selling more clothes 
and general home goods than arts and

crafts, little else about the store or its 
quality of service has changed. Bekah 
continues the same friendly atmos-
phere created by her mother, by bring-
ing her family around to lend a hand in 
the store. Bekah works alongside her 
sister-in-law, as well two full-time 
staff and two local high school stu-
dents who work part-time for Seasonal 
Shoppe. And just how Bekah used to 
work inside her father’s drug store, her 
two children are common faces at Sea-
sonal Shoppe, helping out with mer-
chandise 
sales 
and 
with 
seasonal 
events. 
Bekah not only perpetuates the same 
family-friendly atmosphere created by 
her mother, she pays mind to the tradi-
tions passed down to her by her father. 
Mr. Frazier always said that it was 
their duty as Main Street mainstays to 
support the community. Bekah con-
tinues this tradition by sponsoring the 
local high school sports teams, commu-
nity churches, and most recently help-
ing out the local fire department with 
their annual fundraiser. This chari-
table spirit instilled in her by her par-
ents comes in addition to the good 
business 
sense 
she 
inherited 
from 
them, and it is this special combina-
tion of devotion to the community and 
to the livelihood of the store that has 
kept Seasonal Shoppe running these 
past 25 years. 
Small 
businesses 
like 
Seasonal 
Shoppe are the lifeblood of small towns 
across Kentucky, and they serve as an 
inspiring example of how the entrepre-
neurial spirit transcends multiple gen-
erations. Moreover, the story of Sea-
sonal Shoppe illustrates that some-
times it takes an existing business to 
start a new business, in that Patricia 
reached her customer base through her 
husband’s drug store. Seasonal Shoppe 
and their role in the Salyersville com-
munity demonstrates how small busi-
nesses are an integral part of the daily 
life of small towns across the country, 
and I am thankful for the chance to 
honor these entrepreneurs and what 
they represent. 
Congratulations to Bekah and the en-
tire Seasonal Shoppe team. I wish 
them the best of luck and look forward 
to watching their continued growth 
and success in Kentucky.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 550—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
VALUE 
OF 
THE 
OLDER AMERICANS ACT NUTRI-
TION PROGRAM IN ADDRESSING 
HUNGER, MALNUTRITION, FOOD 
INSECURITY, AND SOCIAL OR GE-
OGRAPHIC ISOLATION AND IM-
PROVING 
THE 
HEALTH 
AND 
QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MILLIONS 
OF OLDER INDIVIDUALS IN THE 
UNITED STATES EACH YEAR 
Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. 
SCOTT
of South Carolina) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 550 
Whereas thousands of local nutrition pro-
grams supported by part C of title III of the 
Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3030d– 
21 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘OAA Nutrition Program’’), both congregate 
and home-delivered programs, provide a vital 
lifeline to millions of individuals 60 years of 
age or older in communities across the 
United States who may be homebound and 
socially or geographically isolated, and 
struggling with hunger, food insecurity, or 
malnutrition; 
Whereas local nutrition programs sup-
ported by the OAA Nutrition Program pro-
vide nutritious meals, socialization, friendly 
visits, 
and 
wellness 
and 
safety 
checks 
through volunteers and staff to individuals 
who may suffer from long-term chronic con-
ditions, as well as to those who live in the 
community and have the greatest social or 
economic need; 
Whereas the official purposes of the OAA 
Nutrition Program are to reduce hunger, 
food insecurity, and malnutrition, to pro-
mote socialization of older individuals, and 
to promote the health and well-being of older 
individuals by assisting such individuals in 
gaining access to nutrition and other disease 
prevention and health promotion services in 
order to delay the onset of adverse health 
conditions resulting from poor nutritional 
health or sedentary behavior; 
Whereas the OAA Nutrition Program saves 
significant taxpayer dollars and reduces 
health care expenditures, often paid through 
Medicare or Medicaid, by helping to reduce 
falls, avoid unnecessary trips, admissions, 
and readmissions to the hospital, expedite 
recovery from illness, and enable older indi-
viduals to live independently for longer; 
Whereas local nutrition programs sup-
ported by the OAA Nutrition Program are 
proven, valuable, and effective public-private 
partnerships that benefit from non-Federal 
private, corporate, and individual funding 
and donations to operate their services effi-
ciently and effectively; 
Whereas the population of individuals in 
the United States who are 60 years of age or 
older is rapidly growing and projected to in-
crease dramatically each year over the next 
several decades; 
Whereas, on March 22, 1972, President Rich-
ard Nixon signed into law Public Law 92–258, 
which amended the Older Americans Act of 
1965 and established a national nutrition pro-
gram for individuals 60 years of age or older; 
and 
Whereas this 50th anniversary of the OAA 
Nutrition Program provides an opportunity 
to celebrate and honor community-based or-
ganizations that deliver vital and critical 
services: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and values the important 
work of local nutrition programs supported 
by part C of title III of the Older Americans 
Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3030d–21 et seq.) (re-
ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘OAA Nu-
trition Program’’) nationwide in giving voice 
to and addressing senior hunger, malnutri-
tion, and isolation, and improving the qual-
ity of life of millions of older individuals in 
the United States each year; 
(2) recognizes and values the important 
role that local nutrition programs supported 
by the OAA Nutrition Program and national 
organizations play in increasing awareness 
of the growing unmet need for these pro-
grams and in raising additional non-Federal 
funds and soliciting volunteers to support 
and assist these programs’ important mis-
sions; 
(3) recognizes and values volunteers as the 
backbone of the OAA Nutrition Program, 
noting that they deliver nutritious meals to 
older individuals who are at significant risk 
of hunger, malnutrition, and isolation, and 
provide caring concern and attention to the 
welfare of program participants; and 
(4) encourages members of Congress to sup-
port their local nutrition programs sup-
ported by the OAA Nutrition Program by 
participating in 50th anniversary events, de-
livering meals to homebound older individ-
uals or serving them in a congregate setting 
with a program in their district or State, 
and working to ensure sustained Federal 
funding for the OAA Nutrition Program.

March 17, 2022 
and Mr. YOUNG) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 551 
Whereas, since their inceptions, each of the 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors na-
tional service programs have proven to be a 
highly effective way— 
(1) to engage the people of the United 
States in meeting a wide range of local and 
national needs; and 
(2) to promote the ethics of service and vol-
unteerism; 
Whereas, each year, more than 250,000 indi-
viduals serve in AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps 
Seniors at more than 40,000 locations across 
the United States to give back in an inten-
sive way to communities, States, Tribal na-
tions, and the United States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Sen-
iors funds have been invested in nonprofit, 
community, educational, and faith-based 
groups, and those funds leverage hundreds of 
millions of dollars in outside funding and in- 
kind donations each year; 
Whereas 
AmeriCorps 
members 
and 
AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers have pro-
vided millions of hours of service nation-
wide, helping— 
(1) to improve the lives of the most vulner-
able people of the United States; 
(2) to protect the environment; 
(3) to contribute to public safety; 
(4) to respond to disasters and public 
health emergencies; 
(5) to strengthen the educational system of 
the United States; and 
(6) to expand economic opportunity; 
Whereas 
AmeriCorps 
members 
and 
AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers recruit and 
supervise millions of community volunteers, 
demonstrating the value of AmeriCorps as a 
powerful force for encouraging people to be-
come involved in volunteering and commu-
nity service; 
Whereas, for more than 5 decades, millions 
of AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers in the 
RSVP, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Com-
panion programs have played an important 
role in strengthening communities by shar-
ing their experience, knowledge, and accom-
plishments with the individuals they serve; 
Whereas, since 1994, more than 1,200,000 in-
dividuals have taken the AmeriCorps pledge 
to ‘‘get things done for America’’ by becom-
ing 
AmeriCorps 
members 
through 
the 
AmeriCorps State and National, AmeriCorps 
VISTA, and AmeriCorps NCCC programs; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members nationwide, 
in return for the service of those members, 
have earned more than $4,000,000,000 to use to 
further their own educational advancement 
at colleges and universities across the 
United States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps is a proven pathway 
to employment, providing members with val-
uable career skills, experience, and contacts 
to prepare them for the 21st century work-
force; 
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the bi-
partisan Serve America Act (Public Law 111– 
13; 123 Stat. 1460), which authorized the ex-
pansion of national service, expanded oppor-
tunities to serve, increased efficiency and ac-
countability, and strengthened the capacity 
of organizations and communities to solve 
problems; 
Whereas national service programs have 
engaged millions of people in the United 
States in results-driven service in the most 
vulnerable 
communities 
of 
the 
United 
States, providing hope and help to individ-
uals with economic and social needs; 
Whereas national service and volunteerism 
demonstrate the best of the spirit of the 
United States, bringing people together to 
address the most pressing challenges in their 
communities; and 
Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 
2022 from March 13 through March 19, is an 
appropriate time for the people of the United 
States— 
(1) 
to 
salute 
current 
and 
former 
AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Sen-
iors volunteers for their positive impact on 
the lives of people in the United States; 
(2) to thank the community partners of 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors for 
making the programs possible; and 
(3) to encourage more people in the United 
States to become involved in service and vol-
unteering: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) encourages the people of the United 
States to join in a national effort— 
(A) to salute AmeriCorps members and 
alumni and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers; 
and 
(B) to raise awareness about the impor-
tance of national and community service; 
(2) acknowledges the significant accom-
plishments of the volunteers, members, 
alumni, 
and 
community 
partners 
of 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors; 
(3) recognizes the important contributions 
made by AmeriCorps members and alumni 
and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers to the 
lives of the people of the United States; and 
(4) encourages individuals of all ages to 
consider 
opportunities 
to 
serve 
in 
AmeriCorps and AmeriCorps Seniors.

AND 
HONORING 
THE 
SIGNIFI-
CANCE OF IRISH-AMERICANS IN 
THE HISTORY AND PROGRESS OF 
THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MURPHY (for himself, Mr. SUL-
LIVAN, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. TOOMEY, Mr. 
DURBIN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. CASEY, Mr. KELLY, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. COONS, Mr. KAINE, and Ms. CORTEZ 
MASTO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 552 
Whereas, from the earliest days of the 
United States, the United States has in-
spired the hopes and dreams of countless in-
dividuals from around the world in search of 
a better life for themselves and their chil-
dren; 
Whereas more than 31,500,000 United States 
citizens trace their ancestry to Ireland; 
Whereas, since before the United States 
was founded, Irish men and women under-
took the perilous journey across the Atlantic 
Ocean to make a home in the United States, 
a place of hope and promise, and made ines-
timable contributions to the United States, 
both during the struggle for independence 
and after the founding of the republic; 
Whereas 9 of the 56 signatories of the Dec-
laration of Independence, 4 associate justices 
of the Supreme Court of the United States, 
and 22 Presidents proudly claim Irish herit-
age. 
Whereas Irish immigrants who came to the 
United States during the Great Famine of 
the 1840s helped transform cities in the 
United States, building them into dynamic 
centers of commerce and industry; 
Whereas the cultural, economic, and spir-
itual contributions of Irish immigrants con-
tinue to be evident today throughout the 
United States; 
Whereas Irish Americans have become 
deeply integrated into communities with 
strength, courage, wit, and creativity, mak-
ing significant contributions in all areas of 
life; 
Whereas Irish-American writers such as 
Eugene O’Neill, John O’Hara, and F. Scott 
Fitzgerald transformed literature in the 
United States, entrepreneurs like Chuck 
Feeney helped revolutionize industry and 
philanthropy in the United States, per-
formers such as Gregory Peck, Lucille Ball, 
and Gene Kelly enriched the arts, and social 
reformers such as suffragist Leonora Barry 
and labor organizer Mary Kenney O’Sullivan 
fought for the rights of others; 
Whereas Irish-Americans have served ably 
in communities in numerous capacities, in-
cluding in public safety and government at 
the Federal, State, and local level, and in the 
Armed Forces in every war in which the 
United States has fought since the Revolu-
tionary War, including patriots such as 
Audie Murphy, the most decorated soldier of 
World War II; 
Whereas, more than 200 years ago, John 
Barry, who was born in Ireland, was the first 
naval hero of the Revolutionary War and be-
came known as the Father of the Navy; 
Whereas the United States played a promi-
nent role in support of negotiations of the 
Good Friday Agreement (also known as the 
Belfast Agreement), done at Belfast, April 10, 
1998, and has taken a leading role in pro-
moting peace on the island of Ireland more 
broadly; 
Whereas Congress greatly values the close 
relationships the United States shares with 
both the United Kingdom and Ireland and is 
steadfastly committed to supporting the 
peaceful resolution of any and all political 
challenges in Northern Ireland; and 
Whereas, on February 28, 2022, President 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., proclaimed March 2022 
as Irish-American Heritage Month: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 2022 as ‘‘Irish-Amer-
ican Heritage Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the significant contributions 
of 
Irish-Americans 
in 
the 
history 
and 
progress of United States; and 
(3) supports the full implementation of the 
Good Friday Agreement (also known as the 
Belfast Agreement) and subsequent agree-
ments or arrangements for implementation 
of that Agreement to support peace on the 
island of Ireland.

States; 
(2) rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, 
a landmark international fossil-fuel suppres-
sion mandate; and 
(3) through Executive Order 13992 (86 Fed. 
Reg. 7049; relating to federal regulation), re-
pealed several executive orders issued by 
President Donald J. Trump that reduced 
Federal regulation and increased regulatory 
transparency, in order to facilitate ‘‘robust 
regulatory 
action’’ 
to 
address 
climate 
change; 
Whereas, during President Biden’s second 
week in office, President Biden issued Execu-
tive Order 14008 (86 Fed. Reg. 7619; relating to 
climate change), which stopped new oil and 
natural gas leases on public lands and off-
shore waters, where approximately a quarter 
of United States oil-and-gas production oc-
curs; 
Whereas, in the first week of May 2021, 
President Biden issued Executive Order 14027 
(86 Fed. Reg. 25947; relating to establishment 
of the Climate Change Support Office), which 
established the Climate Change Support Of-
fice to support efforts by the Biden Adminis-
tration ‘‘to elevate and underscore the com-
mitment the Administration will make to-
wards addressing the global climate crisis’’; 
Whereas, by mid-May 2021, the average 
price of gas had climbed to $3.02 per gallon, 
at which point President Biden signed Exec-
utive Order 14030 (86 Fed. Reg. 27967; relating 
to climate-related financial risk), which di-
rected financial regulators to take actions to 
discourage financing of United States oil- 
and-gas production in order to ‘‘mitigate cli-
mate-related financial risk’’; 
Whereas, by early September 2021, the av-
erage price of gas rose to $3.17 per gallon 
after President Biden signed Executive Order 
14037 (86 Fed. Reg. 43583; relating to clean 
cars and trucks), which requires at least 50 
percent of new sales of passenger cars and 
light-duty trucks in the United States to be 
zero-emission vehicles by 2030; 
Whereas, by early January 2022— 
(1) the Environmental Protection Agency 
had proposed a denial of all pending exemp-
tions to small refineries for compliance 
years 2019 through 2021 and the reversal of 
the decision to grant exemptions for the 2018 
compliance year, meaning that small refin-
eries, which are normally exempt from an-
nual renewable fuel standard (RFS) obliga-
tions, will owe 5 years’ worth of RFS compli-
ance costs in a single calendar year; 
(2) President Biden signed Executive Order 
14057 (86 Fed. Reg. 70935; relating to clean en-
ergy industries and jobs), which called for 
the Federal Government to achieve a carbon- 
free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero 
emissions economy-wide by 2050; and 
(3) the average price of gas was $3.28 per 
gallon; and 
Whereas, 2 days before the Russian Federa-
tion invaded Ukraine and nearly a week be-
fore President Biden banned oil and energy 
imports from the Russian Federation, the 
average price of gas was $3.61 per gallon: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., has im-
plemented policies impeding domestic en-
ergy production and gas prices have steadily 
increased throughout his presidency.

AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND 
PROPOSED 
SA 5001. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO (for Mr. 
SCHATZ (for himself and Mrs. FISCHER)) pro-
posed an amendment to the bill S. 120, to 
prevent and respond to the misuse of com-
munications services that facilitates domes-
tic violence and other crimes. 
TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 5001. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO (for 
Mr. SCHATZ
(for himself and Mrs. 
FISCHER)) proposed an amendment to 
the bill S. 120, to prevent and respond 
to the misuse of communications serv-
ices that facilitates domestic violence 
and other crimes; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Connec-
tions Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, 
terms used in this Act that are defined in 
section 345(a) of the Communications Act of 
1934, as added by section 4 of this Act, have 
the meanings given those terms in such sec-
tion 345(a). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Domestic violence, dating violence, 
stalking, sexual assault, human trafficking, 
and 
related 
crimes 
are 
life-threatening 
issues and have lasting and harmful effects 
on individuals, families, and entire commu-
nities. 
(2) Survivors often lack meaningful sup-
port and options when establishing independ-
ence from an abuser, including barriers such 
as financial insecurity and limited access to 
reliable communications tools to maintain 
essential connections with family, social 
safety networks, employers, and support 
services. 
(3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse de-
scribed in paragraph (1) increasingly use 
technological and communications tools to 
exercise control over, monitor, and abuse 
their victims. 
(4) Communications law can play a public 
interest role in the promotion of safety, life, 
and property with respect to the types of vi-
olence and abuse described in paragraph (1). 
For example, independent access to a wire-
less phone plan can assist survivors in estab-
lishing security and autonomy. 
(5) 
Safeguards 
within 
communications 
services can serve a role in preventing abuse 
and narrowing the digital divide experienced 
by survivors of abuse. 
SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS 
WITHIN 
COMMUNICA-
TIONS SERVICES. 
Part I of title III of the Communications 
Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended 
by adding at the end the following:

HONORING DR. LYNN MARSHALL 
FOR WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Dr. Lynn Mar-
shall’s journey in public health began when 
she worked as an education and training coor-
dinator for Healthy Start Coalition. During that 
time, she joined the Florida Healthy Babies 
committee and led a subcommittee that con-
sisted of the following community partners: 
Lakeland Regional Health Hospital, the Florida 
Department of Health, Healthy Start Coalition, 
Sunshine Health and Spirit Life Ministries. 
In 2019, Dr. Marshall and a handful of com-
munity partners hosted the first Melanin Fami-
lies Matter community event at Lakeland Re-
gional Health Carol Jenkins Barnett Pavilion 
for Women & Children. In August of 2019, Dr. 
Marshall took the initiative to incorporate and 
serve as the president of Melanin Families 
Matter. She has received proclamations on 
behalf of Melanin Families Matter from the 
Polk County Board of County Commissioners, 
Winter Haven Chain of Lakes Mayor Bradley 
T. Dantzler, and the City of Lakeland Mayor 
Bill Mutz. These governmental officers have 
recognized and publicly declared the month of 
March to be Melanin Families Matter month. 
Dr. Marshall continues to host annual Mel-
anin Families Matter health panels and com-
munity events that are open to the public at no 
cost. In addition to providing education to the 
Polk County community, Dr. Marshall also 
spearheads a ‘‘Community Distribution Day’’ 
each year. It is during this time when care 
packages, educational materials, clothing, food 
and play items for babies and children are 
provided to families in need at no cost. As a 
community advocate, Dr. Marshall has served 
as a guest speaker on the following platforms:

State College Women’s History month discus-
sion panel, The Empowered Woman, Our 
Voices Live radio broadcast and more. Dr. 
Marshall is the wife of Dr. Jarvis L. Marshall, 
and together they have two beautiful daugh-
ters.

CORA FAITH WALKER 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, St. Louis and 
I rise to offer our deepest and most sincere 
condolences to the family, friends, and loved 
ones of our dear sister Cora Faith Walker, 
whose beautiful life was taken from our com-
munity far too soon. 
As an exemplary public servant, Cora was a 
champion of transformational policies to lift up 
St. Louis, as evidenced by her work as a 
former Missouri State Representative and top 
policy official in St. Louis County. And in her 
work and beyond it, Cora was a wonderful 
light in this world. She was transformative— 
touching the souls of everyone who encoun-
tered her. She embodied a rare form of altru-
ism that shaped her public service and made 
her an incredible community leader. 
She never took the easy way out. Whether 
it be in her fierce work to deliver justice or her 
gravity defying ability to climb the long marble 
Missouri State Capitol steps in a pair of sti-
lettos—even though there was a perfectly 
good elevator—she did everything with genu-
ineness, style, and class. 
Her accomplishments as a public servant 
are deserving of our highest recognition. She 
used her expertise as a clinical mental health 
professional to deliver groundbreaking legisla-
tive work, securing the passage of the legisla-
tion that created the TraumaInformed Care for 
Children and Families Board. She led the 
charge for Medicaid expansion, especially for 
services geared towards postpartum moms 
struggling with substance use disorder. And 
during my service in Congress, Cora has been 
a close partner in the work to deliver re-
sources to our communities, especially to pre-
vent violent evictions during this deadly pan-
demic. 
Our community is devastated by Cora’s 
passing, and we all will miss her dearly for-
evermore. 
May she be given the flowers she is due, 
may her legacy of love and service live on, 
and may she rest in eternal peace and power.

March 17, 2022 
Brian is a 1983 graduate of West Mecklen-
burg High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Upon graduation, he proudly served in the 
United States Air Force for four years. Fol-
lowing his military service, Brian spent twenty 
years as a very popular and highly regarded 
national gospel performer. 
Although Brian still sings, his career focus 
has since shifted to community service. For 20 
years, he served as the Director of Family Life 
Outreach, an organization that does significant 
charitable work. In 2014, Brian became the Di-
rector of the Boys and Girls Club Jackson 
Teen Center in Camden where he is known as 
Mr. BB to many young people. The Center 
serves as a safe haven for kids after school 
and is open to all middle and high school stu-
dents in Kershaw County. From athletics, to 
academics, to life skills and college prepara-
tion, the after-school center not only gives stu-
dents a place to go, but a place to grow. 
Brian’s wife and life partner, Roberta, also 
serves at the Jackson Teen Center. Fondly 
called ‘‘Mom’’ or ‘‘Auntie Bertie’’ by the teens, 
she leads the Job Readiness Training pro-
gram. 
Under Brian’s leadership, the Center has 
become one of the best attended programs of 
its kind in the entire country. Ninety percent of 
members go on to attend college or join the 
military upon graduation. During his time at 
the Center, Brian has developed numerous in-
novative programs. Some of these programs 
include ‘‘Make it a Conversation,’’ which en-
ables young people to interact with community 
leaders and experts about topics of interest, 
and ‘‘Jobs and Employability Training for 
Teens,’’ which provides job skills, training, and 
internship experiences for high school stu-
dents. Volunteers at the Center describe the 
incredible work Brian does as ‘‘powerful.’’ His 
colleagues recognize the ‘‘hope, belief, and 
positivity’’ he gives to his students. 
Brian has exceeded expectations in service 
to our state, highlighted by his receipt of nu-
merous honors and accolades. For example, 
in 2016, Brian received the Leonard Price 
Award for Community Service. The following 
year, Brian was named ‘‘Person of the Year’’ 
by the Camden Chronicle-Independent and re-
ceived the ‘‘Delta Five Points of Purpose’’ 
Award. He and his wife also received the WIS 
‘‘Community Builder’’ Award. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recog-
nize Brian for his outstanding leadership and 
lifelong service to our state. I wish him the 
best of luck throughout his future endeavors, 
as I am confident he will to continue to serve 
and find great success in all that he does.

IN HONOR OF JOSEPH RUPSIS 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
a patriotic American, Mr. Joseph Rupsis. Mr. 
Rupsis lives in Clark County, Kentucky and 
celebrated his 100th birthday on March 15, 
2022. 
Mr. Rupsis was born in Albany, New York. 
He enlisted in the United States Navy in Octo-
ber of 1942 when he was 20 years of age. 
Following basic training at Great Lakes, Illi-
nois, he was sent to the Pacific Theatre and 
assigned to the USS Victoria, an oil tanker. At 
the war’s end, he was discharged in Decem-
ber of 1945. Mr. Rupsis resumed his work at 
a factory but signed up to serve in the re-
serves. During the Korean Conflict, he was 
called back into service in October of 1950. 
He was assigned to the USS Bataan, an air-
craft carrier. His mother passed away while he 
was serving. Mr. Rupsis attained the rank of 
Petty Officer Second Class. He was dis-
charged in December of 1951. 
Following his discharge in San Diego, Mr. 
Rupsis decided to remain there, where he met 
and married his first wife. Mr. Rupsis worked 
at an aircraft plant, graduated from San Diego 
State, and worked for many years in radio 
broadcasting. He later moved to Florida and 
worked for the Florida prison system, where 
he retired. After Hurricane Charlie destroyed 
his home and possessions, Mr. Rupsis moved 
to Winchester, Kentucky to be near family 
members. It was there that he met his wife, 
Mary. 
It is my honor to recognize this amazing pa-
triot celebrate his 100th birthday, and appre-
ciate him for his service and sacrifice to our 
nation during World War II and the Korean 
Conflict. As a part of ‘‘The Greatest Genera-
tion’’, Mr. Rupsis was an important part of the 
war effort to preserve the freedoms that we 
enjoy today. I am forever grateful for Ameri-
cans like Joseph Rupsis.

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Doris Moore 
Bailey’s innovative marketing skills for a na-
tional youth organization inspired her to de-
velop middle school and teen mom initiatives 
in four Florida counties and 27 schools to pro-
vide services for 1,000 students yearly. An ex-
perienced adjunct professor and YMCA Pro-

OF 
BARLOW 
RES-
PIRATORY HOSPITAL 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Barlow Respiratory Hospital on its 
120th anniversary. 
Barlow Respiratory Hospital was founded in 
1902 as the Barlow Sanatorium, a charity hos-
pital for tuberculosis patients. Since then, Bar-
low Respiratory Hospital has maintained an 
uninterrupted focus on respiratory care and is 
among a few of continuously operating res-
piratory hospitals in the nation. Their award- 
winning programs include their expertise in 
ventilator weaning for post-ICU patients who 
need specialized care. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, Bar-
low Respiratory Hospital physicians have 
served as clinical leaders. Barlow Respiratory 
Hospital’s tradition of care for patients who are 
critically ill, often hovering between life and 
death, now includes care for patients who 
have survived COVID–19. The clinical care 
teams work together to help patients begin to 
recover at Barlow Respiratory Hospital. 
As the only not-for-profit long-term acute 
care hospital and the only not-for-profit res-
piratory hospital in California, Barlow Res-
piratory Hospital has established a legacy of 
service to the Los Angeles community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring and celebrating the 120th an-
niversary of Barlow Respiratory Hospital.

to have family and friends following in his leg-
acy of law and law enforcement, Ret. United 
States Postal Inspector, Samuel Huntley, Jr., 
New 
Orleans 
Police 
Captain, 
Michelle 
Woodfork and United States Magistrate, Judge 
Dana M. Douglas. 
Chief Woodfork was appointed in 1985 by 
the city’s first Black mayor, Ernest ‘‘Dutch’’ 
Morial and served a second term under the 
next mayor, Sidney Barthelemy before retiring 
in 1991. He was previously employed as a 
postal clerk and also served his country in the 
United States Air Force before his 28 year ca-
reer in law enforcement. Chief Woodfork be-
came the first commander of the Felony Ac-
tion Squad, which operated for 10 years be-
ginning in 1972. 
He was also instrumental in making the Po-
lice Department’s district captains accessible 
to neighborhood residents and business own-
ers. Chief Woodfork, a product of the Calliope 
and Lafitte Housing developments, believed in 
community engagement. He saw the future of 
community policing by increasing the visibility 
of top-ranking officers in their district area and 
facilitating the regular and open exchange of 
information between the department with the 
people and businesses. This was a huge shift 
in tone for the department and was an innova-
tive practice that brought a lot of success. 
A 
trailblazer 
in 
his 
own 
right, 
Chief 
Woodfork appointed the first female Deputy 
Chief of the New Orleans Police Department, 
Yvonne Bechet, and the first female district 
commander, Carol Hewitt, who was assigned 
to the Seventh District. He later appointed 
Commander Hewitt as the first female com-
mander of the Narcotics Drug Abuse unit in 
NOPD history. 
Throughout 
his 
administration, 
Chief 
Woodfork also sought creative programs and 
concepts to target the juvenile crime problem 
and the growing level of violence by including 
programming in education, music and sports, 
as the three most important ingredients need-
ed to lead young people away from crime. 
Chief Woodfork was a graduate of the FBI 
National Academy and the John F. Kennedy 
School of Government. He was a member of 
the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCAA), 
Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), 
International Association of Chiefs of Police, 
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), New Orleans 
Black Organization of Police (BOP) and the 
National Organization of Black Law Enforce-
ment, (NOBLE). 
Chief Woodfork retired in 1991 to spend 
more time with his family. Prior to his retire-
ment, he obtained funding for 200 new offi-
cers, along with the purchase of additional 
cars and equipment stating, ‘‘This is a chance 
for me to give my successor a better start 
than I had.’’ 
Though he may be gone, I know that Chief 
Woodfork is still watching over his beloved 
New Orleans community and beloved family.

THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ZETA OMICRON 
CHAPTER OF THE OMEGA PSI 
PHI FRATERNITY 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
wish to recognize and congratulate the Zeta 
Omicron Chapter of the Omega Psi Phi Frater-
nity, Inc. on its 75th anniversary. 
After being chartered in 1947, at what was 
then known as Hampton Institute (now Hamp-
ton University), Zeta Omicron began a journey 
to what would be one of Hampton University’s 
finest organizations and a bold representation 
for positive influence within the community. 
Since its beginning, its members have con-
tinued to display excellence in their commit-
ment to the chapter’s founding principles, 
which are centered on confronting discrimina-
tion in education and the military. As a service 
and social organization, the Zeta Omicron 
Chapter of Omega Psi Phi, Inc. has continued 
to uplift youth and families through countless 
acts of service, including raising money for 
scholarships for high school students every 
year. 
In addition to their scholarship program, 
members also provide meals to families each 
holiday season and support other organiza-
tions through charitable fundraising efforts to 
advance equity in education and opportunity. 
The Zeta Omicron chapter also provides youth 
mentoring programs, which include a con-
ference dedicated to helping students under-
stand the value of education, while pairing 
those students to important resources. Over 
two decades ago, the brothers of Zeta Omi-
cron entered the adopt-a-street program and 
continues this community cleanup effort on 
Marcella Road throughout the year. 
As a historically black university, Hampton 
University has a rich history of excellence and 
integrity, paired with incredible academic 
achievement. The Zeta Omicron chapter con-
tributes to that success. What began as an 
idea from five founding members—Dr. Fred 
Inge, Dr. Don A. Davis, Herman G. Cook, Ar-
thur Burke, and Colonel William H. Moses— 
has flourished as a robust organization built to 
successfully engage with some of the most 
important community priorities needed to build 
a better future. Members of this prestigious or-
ganization go on to succeed in careers in gov-
ernment, higher education, medicine, law, and 
more. It is no surprise that the chapter’s his-
torical mission of removing discrimination from 
the education system and the military con-
tinues today as a distinguished voice in the 
Hampton Roads community. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize and honor the Zeta Omicron Chapter of 
Omega Psi Phi on the celebration of its 75th 
anniversary and commend its members for 
their service and achievements over the years.

HONORING 
MEXICAN 
AMERICAN 
RIGHTS ACTIVIST MARY ESTHER 
BERNAL 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Mrs. Mary Esther 
Bernal who passed away on March 10, 2022. 
For decades, Mrs. Bernal was integral to the 
advancement of Mexican American and Latino 
rights in Texas. Her work changed the lives of 
countless Texans, and she will be greatly 
missed. 
Mary Esther Bernal was born on March 21, 
1935, in San Antonio, Texas. She earned her 
undergraduate and master’s degrees from Our 
Lady of the Lake University. A talented pianist 
who was passionate about using music to 
connect with others, Ms. Bernal taught choir in 
San Antonio Independent School District 
(SAISD) during an era when speaking Spanish 
in Texas schools was against the law. 
Instead of bowing to pressures to suppress 
the culture of her city and her Mexican-Amer-
ican students, Mrs. Bernal celebrated both. 
Together with her husband, State Senator Joe 
Bernal, she pushed Texas schools to provide 
bilingual instruction to English language learn-
ers and end English-only laws. As a commu-
nity leader, Mrs. Bernal served two terms on 
the SAISD Board of Trustees. Mrs. Bernal re-
ceived numerous honors for her work as an 
educator and civic leader. 
Mrs. Bernal was inducted into the San Anto-
nio Women’s Hall of Fame in 1991 and the 
National Hispanic Heritage Hall of Honor in 
2010 for her contributions to education. Mrs. 
Bernal is survived by her husband Joe Bernal, 
sons Richard and Patrick Bernal, daughter Re-
becca Villarreal, six grandchildren, and two 
step-grandchildren. She is preceded in death 
by her youngest son, Bernard Bernal, who 
passed away in 2016. 
Madam Speaker, San Antonio mourns the 
loss of a Hispanic icon. We will miss the 
music she played and the powerful voice she 
projected for equality. Her efforts benefited 
countless Texas families, including mine. Al-
though she has passed, we take comfort re-
membering her through our heritage. I thank 
Mrs. Bernal for her fight. She will be missed.

lucha. Le vamos extran˜ar.)

Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Texas A&M University’s (TAMU) 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy 
(ANRP) Internship Program for the admirable 
work they do to provide students a front-row 
seat to experience and understand the policy-
making process. 
For over 30 years, the ANRP internship pro-
gram has provided students in the College of 
Agriculture and Life Sciences with the chance 
to immerse themselves in the legislative proc-
ess at the state, federal, and international lev-
els. This program helps students obtain intern-
ships in a variety of settings that match their 
career goals in Washington, D.C.; Austin, 
Texas; and Rome, Italy, and provides the op-
portunity to use their academic knowledge in 
a professional setting while gaining real-world 
experience. 
From 2013 to 2021, I had the pleasure of 
hosting 25 ANRP interns in my Washington, 
D.C. office, many of whom went on to pursue 
careers in teaching, law, agriculture, and other 
commendable fields of work. Thanks to the 
excellent education they received at TAMU 
and the unparalleled experience they gained 
through the ANRP program, two of those stu-
dents, Mickeala Carter and Hannah Followill,

FRATERNITY 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 75th anniversary of 
the founding of the Beta Chi Chapter of the 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated at 
Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. 
The Beta Chi Chapter has been the gate-
way for over 400 men into the Kappa Alpha 
Psi Fraternity which was founded 111 years 
ago by ten founders who overcame racism 
and other hardships at Indiana University and 
created an organization that has played a 
major role in the advancement of African- 
Americans and American history. Kappa Alpha 
Psi Fraternity Inc. is dedicated to achievement 
and the development of leaders and has over 
160,000 members and chapters on five con-
tinents. 
Since 1947, the men of the Beta Chi Chap-
ter have endeavored and achieved in many 
occupations including the military, education, 
health care, business, entrepreneurship, jour-
nalism, law enforcement, and the law. The 
chapter has embraced community service and 
has had a positive impact on the Hampton 
and 
greater 
Hampton 
Roads 
community 
through volunteering at the Hampton Boys and 
Girls Club, organizing and leading activities for 
the elderly, conducting food drives, and donat-
ing turkeys and other food during Thanks-
giving. 
The chapter currently has two philanthropic 
and scholarship entities, The Ron Young 
Scholarship and the Kapex Foundation, both 
of which support and empower students in 
their college journeys. The chapter members 
have mentored hundreds of students in their 
chosen majors and provided valuable advice 
and connections once students leave Hamp-
ton University. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, let us celebrate 
75 years of Beta Chi Chapter of Kappa Alpha 
Psi Fraternity, Inc.’s achievement at Hampton 
University. As the chapter forges onward, it 
carries with it a continued commitment to sup-
porting Hampton University and the greater 
Hampton Roads community, while also up-
holding the high standards of the fraternity and 
its members.

CELEBRATING THE TEN-YEAR AN-
NIVERSARY OF LEMON POPPY 
KITCHEN 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Lemon Poppy Kitchen res-
taurant in the community of Glassell Park on 
its ten-year anniversary. 
Lemon Poppy Kitchen opened for business 
in March 2012 with hardly any money, a cou-
ple of handmade tables, and a counter crafted 
by a friend on the promise of free ice coffee 
and biscuits. The three owners Katie Kildow, 
Anca Caliman, and Jack Wilson were the 
cooks, waiters, and cashiers. 
From your first interaction with Lemon 
Poppy Kitchen, you know you are in for a 
treat. ‘‘We make food from scratch with love,’’ 
says Anca. The team is a compassionate 
group that is engaged with the Glassell Park 
community and beyond. During the pandemic, 
Lemon Poppy Kitchen worked with the 
Glassell Park Improvement Association to pro-
vide 50 cooked meals a day, six days a week, 
for seniors. They have also helped raise funds 
for the homeless community of Skid Row in 
Los Angeles. 
Once you make your first order at the res-
taurant you feel the sense of community. ‘‘We 
wanted to make a spot where everyone wants 
to be,’’ says Katie. Ten years later the Glassell 
Park community has shown that Lemon Poppy 
Kitchen is the go-to spot for good coffee, pas-
tries, and meals. ‘‘We are happy we made it 
[to ten years]. There have been some rough 
patches, but the people that come here feel 
like family after a while,’’ says Jack. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Katie, Anca, Jack and 
Lemon Poppy Kitchen on their ten-year anni-
versary. I also extend to all of them my best 
wishes for many more years of success. I in-
vite my colleagues to stop by Lemon Poppy 
Kitchen the next time they are in Los Angeles.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
CHIEF ROBINSON 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chief C.A. ‘‘Andy’’ Robin-
son and his outstanding service to our state. 
Chief Robinson has spent much of his life as 
a law enforcement officer and is a dedicated 
and compassionate member of our commu-
nity. 
Chief Robinson has spent 25 years serving 
his community and as a law enforcement offi-
cer for various municipal and county agencies. 
Throughout the last eleven years, he has 
served as Chief for the York Police Depart-
ment. Under Chief Robinson’s leadership, the 
York Police Department has implemented a 
community policing philosophy to foster and 
bridge connections with businesses, local 
civics organizations, churches, schools, and 
citizens across York. Some of these initiatives 
include York’s National Night Out, hosting 
summer youth camps, fundraisers, blood 
drives, and holiday outreach programs. 
In addition to his outstanding work in law 
enforcement, Chief Robinson also serves on 
numerous boards and committees. For exam-
ple, Chief Robinson is a past President of the 
South Carolina Police Chiefs Association 
(SCPCA). He has also served as Chairman of 
the York County Law Enforcement Governing 
Board since 2011 and is an active member of 
the South Carolina Law Enforcement Officers’ 
Association, International Association of Chiefs 
of Police, and the FBI National Academy As-
sociations. Additionally, Chief Robinson has 
spoken to several South Carolina House and 
Senate subcommittees on various topics. 
Chief Robinson is dependable, compas-
sionate, and has earned the respect of law en-
forcement and citizens all over South Carolina. 
He has exceeded expectations in service to 
our state, highlighted by his receipt of numer-
ous honors and accolades. For example, Chief 
Robinson is the only York Police Chief to re-
ceive the Strom Thurmond Award for Excel-
lence in Law Enforcement, which is the high-
est law enforcement honor in the state. He 
also received an award for Outstanding Serv-
ice to the Community of York by the York 
Men’s Club. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recog-
nize Chief Robinson for his outstanding lead-
ership and service to our state. I wish him the 
best of luck throughout his future endeavors, 
as I am confident he will continue to serve and 
find great success in all that he does. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE FIRST BAT 
MITZVAH 
IN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the 
centennial anniversary of the first Bat Mitzvah 
of an American girl, which took place on 
March 18, 1922, at the Society for the Ad-
vancement of Judaism (SAJ) in New York 
City. 
At 12 years of age, Judith Kaplan became 
the first girl on American soil to formally step 
into the Jewish community by becoming a Bat 
Mitzvah (daughter of the commandments). Her 
father, Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, founded 
SAJ just three months prior, in January of 
1922. He believed strongly that girls should 
have equal religious opportunities, so he ar-
ranged for his daughter to read from the Torah 
soon after the synagogue was created. 
This momentous occasion helped begin the 
meaningful inclusion of women and girls in 
Jewish religious life. Bat Mitzvahs became 
common place, Jewish women started to 
serve in leadership roles in synagogues and 
organizations, and exactly 50 years later, the 
first female rabbi in American history was or-
dained by a rabbinical seminary. 
Judith Kaplan’s Bat Mitzvah was also the 
first in a long line of countless innovative and 
groundbreaking 
advancements 
in 
Jewish 
thought and practice by SAJ and their leader-
ship. 
Rabbi Kaplan established SAJ as the first 
synagogue based on the principles of Recon-
struction, which views Judaism as a constantly 
evolving civilization. He believed that Jewish 
life was rooted in tradition but also able to 
adapt 
alongside 
the 
ever-changing 
cir-
cumstances of wider society under that guid-
ing principle. 
Since Rabbi Kaplan’s pioneering tenure, 
SAJ has continued to live up to his powerful 
legacy of American Jewish innovation. The 
synagogue is considered a cornerstone of 
Jewish life in New York’s Upper West Side. 
SAJ, led by an all-female clergy and staff, is 
an intellectual stalwart in the community that is 
dedicated to practicing a modern, American, 
egalitarian form of Judaism. They advance 
Jewish education, arts, music, and cultural 
self-expression as vital to the religious prac-
tice. 
SAJ upholds the Jewish tenet of tikkun 
olam, a Hebrew phrase that means to repair 
the world. The synagogue embodies this 
teaching by working for economic, immigrant, 
and reproductive justice; affirming LGBTQ+ 
members and interfaith families; and actively 
supporting and partnering with New York 
City’s Westside Campaign Against Hunger to 
fight against food insecurity. 
I honor Judith Kaplan’s courage and cele-
brate 
the 
100th 
anniversary 
of 
her 
groundbreaking Bat Mitzvah. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the Society for the Ad-
vancement of Judaism’s remarkable contribu-
tions to the Jewish community in New York 
City and all over the world.

er for the emerging markets of Latin America 
and Asia, supporting 17 countries and $1 bil-
lion in revenue. Bill currently serves as the

wife have three daughters, Erin, Emily, and 
Allie. 
I am honored to join with the Greater 
Pittston Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in recog-
nizing Bill as the 2022 Swingle Award Winner. 
He has dedicated his career to supporting cut-
ting edge medical research in the life sciences 
industry while also volunteering his time to 
support his community. May he continue to 
find fulfillment in his work and giving back to 
his fellow citizens.

HONORING ASMA PATEL FOR 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Asma Patel is 
a board-certified attorney who has diligently 
served and continues to serve the Osceola 
County community. Ms. Patel holds dual de-
grees with honors in Psychology and Legal 
Studies as well as a Juris Doctor degree. Dur-
ing her law school career, Ms. Patel was a 
student ambassador, mentor, and the Presi-
dent of the Muslim Law School Association at 
her alma mater. She honed her dispute reso-
lution skills by competing in and ultimately 
winning first place in an International Law 
School Mediation Tournament. During this 
time, she continued to demonstrate her dedi-
cation to serving her community as a guardian 
ad item fellow. In this role, she played a cru-
cial role as a representative for abused, aban-
doned, and/or neglected children. 
Ms. Patel has spearheaded community ini-
tiatives aimed at ending domestic violence. As 
a certified domestic abuse victim advocate, 
she has assisted survivors in crisis by pro-
viding essential resources and support. In an 
effort to create awareness, she has hosted 
family empowerment seminars and tabled at 
events aimed at tackling domestic abuse. 
Through mentorship, extensive networking, 
and volunteerism, Ms. Patel has worked with 
marginalized and vulnerable communities, 
striving to bring light and change to the social 
injustices that plague them. Most recently, she 
has begun to help address the issue of inac-
cessibility to feminine hygiene products by 
providing these products to local Title I 
schools. Ms. Patel’s bridge the gap initiatives 
in Osceola County are inspired by her desire 
to take action that empowers women to be 
courageous in the pursuit of their dreams.

HONORING LILLIAN TAMAYO 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lillian 
Tamayo, a distinguished local health care ad-
vocate, on her recent retirement. For more 
than 20 years, Lillian has been a champion for 
women, 
teens, 
and 
members 
of 
the 
LGBTQIA+ community across South Florida. 
She worked tirelessly to increase their access 
to and awareness of quality affordable health 
care services. 
As President and CEO of Planned Parent-
hood of South, East and North Florida, Lillian 
expanded the organization’s reach to eight of 
the state’s most diverse counties and broad-
ened its services to historically overlooked 
groups. One of the most successful initiatives 
that she led, La Promesa, engaged Latina 
women who were previously underserved in 
South Florida. 
During the most difficult times in the abor-
tion movement, Lillian stood strong and fear-
lessly led in the fight for reproductive freedom. 
She advocated in federal court to block past 
Florida laws designed to limit abortions. Lillian 
also fought to extend health services and 
counseling options to South Florida teens and 
members of the LGBTQIA+ community. As a 
result of her advocacy, Planned Parenthood is 
now a judgement-free zone where young peo-
ple can go to receive HIV and STI screenings, 
hormone therapy, discuss birth control options, 
and receive mental health counseling. 
Lillian’s dedication to health care access 
and education is truly admirable. Her work has 
created a space in which women and men 
across Florida can feel safe for years to come. 
I am proud to celebrate her today and wish 
her the very best on her retirement.

Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and honor the Hamp-
ton University Choir on its 150th anniversary. 
The Hampton University Choir was estab-
lished in 1870 as the Hampton Singers just a

founded in 1868 as the Hampton Normal and 
Agricultural Institute. Since then, Hampton 
University has continued to break new ground 
in academic achievement as one of Virginia’s 
top Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities. 
The university’s motto is ‘‘The Standard of 
Excellence, an Education for Life’’, and that is 
exactly what the Hampton University Choir 
has exemplified over the last 150 years. As 
the primary touring ensemble for the univer-
sity, the Choir has distinguished itself by per-
forming in numerous notable venues across 
the United States and abroad, including Car-
negie Hall and the Kennedy Center. The 
Hampton University Choir even performed at 
the second Inauguration of President William 
Jefferson Clinton in 1997. 
I want to congratulate the President of 
Hampton University, Dr. William R. Harvey, 
the Director of University Choirs, Omar 
Dickenson, and the Assistant Director of Alum-
ni Affairs, Dr. Joan Wickham for their years of 
service and dedication to the Hampton Univer-
sity community. The Hampton University Choir 
has and continues to be an essential piece of 
what makes Hampton University so special. 
Congratulations to the Hampton University 
Choir on their 150th anniversary. I wish them 
many more years of success.

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, the Com-

cer Caleb Daniel Ogilvie of the Covington Po-
lice Department. 
Officer Ogilvie was killed in the line of duty 
on March 14, 2022, at the age of 35. Though 
he was taken too soon, his life was evidence 
of his noble commitment to protecting the 
safety and freedom of others above himself. 
He was born in Wisconsin to Daniel Ray-
mond Ogilvie and Delora Anne Chambers 
Ogilvie. 
Before serving the City of Covington in law 
enforcement, Officer Ogilvie served his coun-
try for four years in the United States Marine 
Corps. Two of his tours were spent in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. He was also a volunteer fire-
fighter and an emergency medical technician 
for Roanoke County. 
Officer Ogilvie was a loving father, husband, 
son, brother, and friend. Along with his par-
ents, he is survived by his wife, Natasha Erin 
Ogilvie; and four daughters, Emersyn and 
Wrenley Ogilvie, and Kileigh and Rilyn Ogilvie 
and their mother, Malarie Ogilvie. He is also 
survived by his sister, Abigail Chave, and two 
brothers, Rian and Benjamin Ogilvie; along 
with many other beloved close family and 
friends. 
Officer Ogilvie lived a life of self-sacrifice. 
He was a distinguished public servant who put 
his life on the line every day as he coura-
geously defended those around him. The 
death of Officer Ogilvie is a grievous loss to 
the Commonwealth of Virginia and the City of 
Covington. I mourn his loss, yet I am grateful 
that he and the other men and women of law 
enforcement step forward to protect us know-
ing full well the risks they face. His bravery 
and selfless service will not be forgotten.

ager Program from Florida State University. 
Deputy Chief Holland’s first thoughts of a 
law enforcement career surfaced at 15. Her 
best friend’s dad was a retired Deputy Sheriff, 
which sparked her interest in Law Enforce-
ment. This interest quickly developed into a 
passion, and when she graduated from High 
School, she immediately accepted a position 
at the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. 
Deputy Chief Betty Holland’s career goals 
include becoming Chief of Police with the Kis-
simmee Police Department and continuing to 
build relationships with the community. She is 
passionate about lowering crime rates with in-
novative new deterrent measures, holding 
public servants to higher standards and ex-
pectations, and creating more open lines of 
communication between officers and civilians. 
Her actions regarding these objectives remain 
a consistent measure of her interests in the 
betterment of the field of law enforcement.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, 
March 15, 2022, I was unable to vote on Roll 
Call vote No. 72: Motion to Suspend the Rules 
and Pass H.R. 5001, to authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to continue to implement 
endangered fish recovery programs for the 
Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins, 
and for the other purposes. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ‘‘yes.’’

FEBRUARY CONSTITUENTS OF THE 
MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Cynthia and W.B. 
May, two veterans and owners of Cynthia’s 
Artistic Expressions in Oceanside, California, 
as my Constituents of the Month for their in-
valuable contributions to our community. 
After both serving in the Navy during the 
Gulf War, W.B. was diagnosed with post-trau-
matic stress disorder, and Cynthia was diag-
nosed with anxiety. Once they separated from 
the military, they realized they needed a way 
to express themselves and manage their post- 
traumatic stress and anxiety. They opened 
Cynthia’s Artistic Expressions in order to help 
veterans and others deal with mental or emo-
tional health challenges, while also making art 
more accessible, and their establishment has 
become an integral piece of our Oceanside 
community. Since they opened their doors, 
they 
have 
seen 
countless 
veterans, 
servicemembers, and civilians benefit from 
therapeutic art healing. At a time when our na-
tion is grappling with tragic rates of veteran 
suicide, I am very grateful that they provide 
this healing opportunity for our local military 
community. 
Cynthia and W.B. strengthen our community 
far beyond the doors of their art studio, too. 
They are known for doing extensive outreach 
to the community of veterans and military fam-
ilies around Marine Corps Base Camp Pen-
dleton, hosting food drives through their 
church, Shiloh Church of God in Christ in 
Oceanside, on the last Thursday of every 
month for servicemembers and their families 
who struggle with food insecurity. According to 
the San Diego Food Bank, nearly 39,000 vet-
erans and active-duty military personnel and 
their dependents use their services every 
month, so the work that Cynthia and W.B. do 
to help feed military families is critically impor-
tant. They have also worked with vet centers 
and retirement homes to lighten the facilities 
with fine art, and they have also donated their 
time to organizations like the Boys and Girls 
Club, the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP), and 
the North County African American Women’s 
Association (NCAAWA). 
I created a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize local individuals who give 
back to our community in extraordinary ways, 
but who often don’t receive the recognition 
they deserve. Cynthia and W.B. certainly meet 
that criteria, and I cannot thank them enough 
for everything they have contributed to make 
Oceanside a brighter, healthier place. It’s also 
my honor to recognize them during Black His-
tory Month, when we celebrate the contribu-
tions and accomplishments of Black Ameri-
cans throughout our Nation’s history. On be-
half of a proud and grateful community, it’s my 
pleasure to recognize them as our Constitu-
ents of the Month.

HONORING YULONDA BELL FOR 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Yulonda Bell 
serves as Associate Dean for Student Serv-
ices at Polk State College, where she listens 
to, learns from, and encourages people from 
all walks of life to achieve their dreams. Bell 
is a strong leader who does not seek the spot-
light and prefers to work in the background 
providing guidance and support that fosters 
student success. 
Born and raised in Bartow, Bell was a teen 
parent who overcame obstacles to achieve her 
diploma and provide for her family. Her perse-
verance resulted in her achievement of an as-
sociate degree from Polk Community College, 
a bachelor’s degree from Warner University, 
and a master’s degree from Webster Univer-
sity—all while raising two sons. 
She 
first 
served 
Polk 
County 
Public 
Schools, followed by positions with the Florida 
Department of Children and Families, and fi-
nally Polk State College. She was the first in 
her family to achieve a college diploma, pro-
viding her with an understanding of the chal-
lenges that students of color and first-genera-
tion-in-college students face as they navigate 
higher education. 
She is a leader on campus. serving as an 
advisor to the Black Student Union, a founder 
of S.I.S.T.E.R.S. (Strong, Independent Sisters, 
That Encourage, Respect, and Survive), and a 
mentor for Polk State Basketball and STEM 
Club students. 
She also invests time as a member of the 
organizing committee for the City of Winter 
Haven Juneteenth Celebration, serving on the 
City of Winter Haven’s Martin Luther King 
Committee, volunteering at the Neighborhood 
Service Center, and participating in Lift Lake-
land to improve race relations and expand 
economic, education, and civic involvement. 
Bell lives Maya Angelou’s quote, ‘‘People 
will forget what you said, people will forget 
what you did, but people will never forget how 
you made them feel,’’ as she plays an impor-
tant role in supporting students and cele-
brating their achievements. 
RECOGNIZING THE WOMEN’S CLUB 
OF BAKERSFIELD 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Women’s Club of Bakers-
field on their 126th birthday. 
Founded in 1896, the Women’s Club of Ba-
kersfield is the oldest cultural club in Kern 
County. They erected their first building in 
1900 and after outgrowing it, moved into their 
current home in November 1921. 
The Women’s Club not only provides a 
dedicated space for women to organize, but 
they also have a rich history of philanthropic 
work within the community. Some of the 
Club’s achievements include their advocacy 
for Women’s Suffrage, help to create the first 
public library in Bakersfield, and preservation 
efforts for the Beale Clock Tower and Cali-
fornia Redwoods. They also provide hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in scholarships to local 
students and do important work to support 
local troops and veterans. 
Their dedication to service and giving back 
has been felt by thousands of people through-
out Kern County. These women of all ages 
and backgrounds are a true testament to the 
passion and selflessness that epitomizes our 
Central Valley community. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing the 
Women’s Club of Bakersfield for 126 years of 
service to the Bakersfield community.

COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY 
HEALTH CARELINK 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today commemorating the 25th anniver-
sary of the University Health CareLink. For 
more than two decades, CareLink has pro-
vided invaluable healthcare services to Bexar 
County’s most vulnerable residents. I am hon-
ored to recognize their efforts this day. 
Bexar County has long struggled to make 
sure that every resident can access con-
sistent, high-quality health care. Many county 
residents live below the poverty line, are unin-
sured, and struggle to get by. Since 1997, 
CareLink under University Health System has 
stepped up to meet the needs facing our less 
fortunate. University Health has transformed 
the lives of the uninsured by offering its mem-
bers comprehensive and flexible care based 
on each member’s unique circumstance. 
For 
25 
years 
CareLink 
has 
provided 
461,472 low-income, uninsured residents ac-
cess to a full range of medical services. 
CareLink now averages 27,850 members each 
month and connects 100 percent of its mem-
bers with a health care provider. CareLink has 
become a model for the nation in providing ac-
cess to essential and affordable health care 
services. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing 25 years of invaluable service by Uni-
versity Health CareLink. I am confident that

HONORING LAUDI CAMPO FOR 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 17, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Laudi Campo 
was born and raised in Morovis, Puerto Rico. 
Through a twenty-five-year professional trajec-
tory in Communications, Government, and 
Nonprofits, she continues to build organiza-
tions, create partnerships, and implement in-
novative outreach and services for the com-
munity. 
Her career started at the Puerto Rico Sen-
ate as a Communications Specialist. She then 
became an English teacher and later gained 
valuable experience in federal grant manage-
ment in the private sector. As Public Relations 
Director for the Vega Alta city, her most nota-
ble contribution became a radio program to 
connect the community with the local govern-
ment. 
In 2011, she moved with her family to Or-
lando, where she has been a noteworthy play-
er in Hispanic relations in Central Florida. As 
a Spanish-language teacher, she acquired val-
uable insight into the education system. But 
her passion for community work reignited at 
the Orange County Property Appraiser and the 
City of Orlando’s District 2 office, a sector rich 
in diversity and community pride, where she 
helped people of different nationalities. One of 
the most significant achievements became her 
work on the Trust Act Policy, which was ap-
proved unanimously by the Orlando City 
Council and helps non-citizens who are crime 
victims. 
In 2019 Laudi was named Deputy Director 
for Hispanic Federation—Florida, the nation’s 
premier Latino nonprofit. She directed the 
Census, Voter Registration, and COVID–19 
media campaigns during the pandemic. In 
2021 she became HF Florida State Director. 
She expanded services and spearheaded a 
massive effort to vaccinate 13,000 individuals 
and educate more than 1 million Floridians on 
vaccines. She foresaw a pandemic aftershock 
and provided $1 million in financial aid to local 
nonprofits. Laudi continues to forge partner-
ships and advocate for affordable housing, im-
migration, environmental justice, and fair redis-
tricting. Most recently, she was recognized by 
the 2021 Tech Innovadores for her work in 
digital inclusion.
