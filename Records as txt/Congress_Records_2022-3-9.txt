PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, our lives are in Your 
hands. In You do we find wisdom and 
strength. From You are we provided 
counsel and understanding. 
Therefore, we will not fear, though 
the Earth should change, though the 
mountains shake in the heart of the 
sea; though its waters roar and foam, 
though the mountains tremble in the 
heart of the sea. 
God, be in the midst of us, in this 
Chamber, in this city, in this country, 
and in this world. In the dawning of 
this morning, God help us all. The na-
tions are in an uproar, but at the sound 
of Your voice kingdoms totter. When 
you speak, the Earth melts. 
Speak into the cacophony of chaos 
and topple all pride and arrogance. 
Utter Your words of wisdom and melt 
the folly of fearmongering. Silence all 
voices but Your own. Then let us be 
still and know that You alone are God. 
In the strength of Your name we 
offer our prayers this day. 
Amen.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

f 
OLATHE EAST HIGH SCHOOL 
SHOOTING 
(Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, last Friday a student brought 
a gun into Olathe East High School. By 
noon, three people, an assistant prin-
cipal, a school resource officer, and a 
student were on their way to the Over-
land Park Regional Medical Center 
with gunshot wounds. 
Students hid in classrooms sending 
texts that every parent dreads receiv-
ing: Someone is shooting inside the 
school. Thanks to the actions of Officer 
Erik Clark and the assistant principal 
Kaleb Stoppel, those parents were able 
to reunite with their students safely on 
Friday afternoon. 
We are all grateful and hoping for 
their full recovery. I know I am not 
alone in thinking that things could 
have been much worse were it not for 
their intervention. 
I would also like to commend the 
Olathe Police Department, fire depart-
ment, and Johnson County MED-ACT 
for their exemplary response. Thank 
you for helping keep our community 
safe. These are the headlines that 
every American is tired of reading, 
that everyone fears will come to their 
doorstep. 
We must step up mental health sup-
port in schools—not just in the after-
math of trauma, but permanently. I 
stand with every parent, educator, stu-
dent, and Kansan who has come to-
gether to call for commonsense gun 
safety. We have to be brave enough to 
put our kids’ lives first.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1380 
March 9, 2022 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIAN ENERGY 
IMPORTS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden administration imposed sanc-
tions on Russian energy imports. Biden 
finally listened to Republicans, but it 
means nothing if he is unwilling to 
take action to restore American energy 
independence today. 
The alternative is President Biden 
begging 
countries 
like 
Venezuela, 
Saudi Arabia, and Iran for energy, in 
which case, all we have done is trade 
one tyrant for another. It is clear what 
we must do to lower energy costs: open 
the Keystone XL pipeline, encourage 
expedited permits, allow leasing on 
Federal lands. 
It is unclear whether this adminis-
tration is willing to put aside its Green 
New Deal pipe dream to make it hap-
pen. It is absolutely shameful that the 
President would rather make deals 
with our adversaries than build the 
Keystone XL pipeline or remove bur-
densome regulations on America’s en-
ergy producers. 
Under every single circumstance, 
Biden has chosen foreign energy over 
American energy, adversarial nations 
over the American people. That is the 
definition of America last. It is time to 
put America first. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RENNY 
CUSHING 
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of a 
true New Hampshire original, a dedi-
cated public servant, and a passionate 
advocate for the causes that he held 
dear. 
Renny Cushing, the Democratic lead-
er of the New Hampshire House of Rep-
resentatives, passed away on Monday 
after a courageous battle with cancer. 
I served with Renny in the State 
House and I saw firsthand his compas-
sion, empathy, and good faith that he 
brought to every issue and every de-
bate. He was guided by a strong moral 
compass and a sense of liberty and jus-
tice, right and wrong. 
His loss leaves a hole in New Hamp-
shire that can never be filled, and we 
should all take inspiration from the 
legacy that he leaves behind. We will 
miss our friend. New Hampshire will 
miss the tireless spirit of a man who 
spent his life in the arena striving to 
make people’s lives better and striving 
to make hope and history rhyme. 
My thoughts are with his family, his 
three daughters, and all who knew him 
and were touched by his example. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE NAEVE FAMILY 
BEEF PROCESSING PLANT 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to share the story 
of a family in my district that is work-
ing to make sure their friends and 
neighbors know where and how their 
beef is raised. 
Last Saturday the Naeve family of 
Camanche, a sixth-generation farming 
family, officially opened the new Naeve 
Family Beef processing plant. For gen-
erations the Naeve family has raised 
cattle and grown crops in eastern Iowa, 
with three generations currently work-
ing the farm in Camanche. 
For years, smaller meat packing op-
erations like the Naeve’s have faced an 
uphill battle against the bigger meat 
packers in the industry. Last year, I 
introduced the Meat Packing Special 
Investigators 
Act 
to 
tackle 
anti-
competitive practices in the meat and 
poultry industries that threaten the 
American food supply and U.S. na-
tional security. 
Right now, the four big meat packers 
purchase and process 85 percent of the 
total U.S. beef production. My legisla-
tion would give the Department of Ag-
riculture the tools it needs to crack 
down on bad actors and push for fair 
competition within the marketplace. 
Overconcentration in the meat pack-
ing industry is costing Iowa farmers 
money left and right while the average 
American pays more at the store. 
I will continue to fight for family op-
erations like the Naeves and wish them 
the best of luck as they begin this new 
journey and improvise to create a bet-
ter marketplace. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THE GIRL 
SCOUTS OF SAN JACINTO COUNCIL 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the Girl 
Scouts of San Jacinto Council on their 
century of service to the girls of south-
east Texas. One hundred years ago, the 
Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council was 
founded in Texas. Today, the council 
has grown immensely to 54,000 Girl 
Scout members. That is a lot of girls 
who are being empowered to lead and 
serve. 
You see, Girl Scouts are change-
makers who become bold and strong 
leaders. In fact, the 117th Congress 
boasts a record number of women mem-
bers, and more than 55 percent of us 
are Girl Scout alums. 
While I never really was a Girl Scout, 
I served on their board for many years 
in Houston, and I know firsthand no 
matter what these Girl Scouts choose 
to do in life, they will be well-prepared. 
I can’t wait to see what the next 100 
years will bring to the Girl Scouts of 
San Jacinto Council. 
HONORING THE ENTERPRISE HIGH 
SCHOOL 
MEN’S 
BASKETBALL 
TEAM 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, it is my great privilege to honor En-
terprise High School men’s basketball 
team on winning their first-ever Class 
7A championship. 
As a Wildcat alum, I could not be 
prouder of these men for their dedica-
tion and performance. The players who 
sweated through countless practices, 
the coaches who led them, and the 
faithful Wildcat fans who traveled to 
support the team should all be proud of 
this remarkable achievement. 
Coach Rhett Harrelson, a friend and 
fellow Enterprise native, and his staff 
deserve great credit for leading our 
young men to this championship. Our 
fans have our sincere appreciation for 
ensuring that the home games were 
rowdy and our team always had famil-
iar faces screaming at the away games. 
As a fellow Wildcat, I want to honor 
this amazing team for all they have ac-
complished, and I look forward to 
watching this program continue to 
grow. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LOCAL UKRAIN-
IAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I re-
cently attended a gathering of the 
local Ukrainian-American community 
in my district. I heard so many heart-
breaking 
accounts. 
One 
man, 
Joe 
Galazin, told me about his wife, Elena, 
their two kids, 9-year-old Olesya and 
16-year-old Dinillo. 
The children were expecting to start 
school soon in the same Pennsylvania 
public schools where my two children 
went many years ago. Instead, they got 
trapped in Kharkiv. Unable to get out 
before the bombs began raining down, 
they found refuge in a bomb shelter. 
My office is in communication with the 
family—they are in a holding pattern 
in Lviv, uncertain of how or when they 
will be able to make the increasingly 
dangerous trip to the Polish border. 
These children will never be able to 
unsee the devastation they witnessed. 
They know that relatives who had to 
stay behind may lose their lives. Why? 
Because 
of 
this 
completely 
unprovoked, illegal invasion, and these 
air strikes on civilians who simply 
want to live in peace. 
The injustice is overwhelming. We 
must redouble our efforts to support 
the Ukrainian people in this fight for 
their sovereignty.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 972 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 972 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 2471) to meas-
ure the progress of post-disaster recovery 
and efforts to address corruption, govern-

Haiti, with the Senate amendment thereto, 
and to consider in the House, without inter-
vention of any point of order, a motion of-
fered by the chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations or her designee that the House 
concur in the Senate amendment with an 
amendment consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117-35. The Senate amend-
ment and the motion shall be considered as

to its adoption without intervening motion. 
The question of adoption of the motion shall 
be divided for a separate vote on all of the 
matter proposed to be inserted by the 
amendment of the House other than divi-
sions B, C, F, X, and Z, and titles 2 and 3 of 
division N. The two portions of the divided

continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2022, and for other pur-
poses. All points of order against consider-
ation of the joint resolution are waived. The

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
GARCIA of Texas). The gentleman from 
Massachusetts is recognized for 1 hour. 
b 0915 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
who is my good friend, pending which I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. During consideration of this res-
olution, all time yielded is for the pur-
pose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me wish a good morning to my good 
friend, Mr. COLE. It feels like just a 
couple of hours ago I was saying good 
morning. Let me say to the gentleman 
that he looks marvelous for getting no 
sleep, and it is great to be with my 
friend. 
Madam Speaker, the Rules Com-
mittee met and reported a rule, House 
Resolution 972, providing for consider-
ation of the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2022. It provides for a motion 
to concur in the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 2471 with a House amendment and 
1 hour of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. It divides the question 
on adoption of the motion into two 
votes in the order specified by the 
chair, and provides that if any portion 
of the divided question fails, then the 
House shall be considered to have made 
no disposition of the Senate amend-
ment. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.J. Res. 75, the Extension of 
Continuing Appropriations Act, 2022, 
under a closed rule. It provides 1 hour 
of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations and provides for one mo-
tion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 6968, the Suspending 
Energy Imports From Russia Act, 
under a closed rule. It provides 1 hour 
of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Ways 
and Means and provides one motion to 
recommit. 
Madam Speaker, the bills contained 
in the rule are about investing in our 
communities and families here at home 
and living up to our values abroad. 
Throughout 
last 
summer, 
House 
Democrats were hard at work passing 
appropriations bills funding nearly all 
of the Federal Government to build on 
the momentum of our economic recov-
ery. This full-year omnibus is the prod-
uct of extensive bipartisan, bicameral 
negotiations. Both sides have come to-
gether to produce an agreement to fund 
the government that I think has re-
sulted in a very, very good bill. 
That means this agreement does not 
include everything I wanted, and I 
know it doesn’t include everything my 
Republican 
friends 
wanted. 
But 
I 
think, at the end of the day, it is a 
good package that is going to benefit 
the American people. 
I especially want to recognize Chair-
woman DELAURO and Ranking Member 
GRANGER and thank them for forging a 
bipartisan path forward. I also want to 
take this opportunity to thank the in-
credible staff of the Appropriations 
Committee as well as the incredible 
staff of the Rules Committee—Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans—who 
have 
worked tirelessly to bring this legisla-
tion to the floor today. I think most of 
my colleagues here do not appreciate 
how hard the staff works, and I think 
the American people ought to be proud 
of those who serve up here in both par-
ties for their public service. 
The work of Chairwoman DELAURO 
and Ranking Member GRANGER could 
not have come at a more critical time. 
We are at a moment in history that de-
mands a strong and confident America,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1382 
March 9, 2022 
and the certainty provided by this om-
nibus will allow us to tackle some of 
our country’s biggest challenges by 
helping to support good-paying Amer-
ican jobs; by building ladders of oppor-
tunity for hardworking families; by 
confronting the existential threat of 
climate change; and by investing in 
lifesaving 
research 
into 
maternal 
health, 
mental 
health, 
and 
opioid 
abuse. 
I am proud that we negotiated a gov-
ernment funding package that centers 
on the needs of middle-class and work-
ing families, not the rich and not on 
powerful special interests. 
I am particularly proud that one of 
the provisions included in this pack-
age—funding for a White House Con-
ference on Food, Nutrition, Hunger, 
and Health—is something that we have 
worked together on in a bipartisan way 
at the Rules Committee and with 
Democrats and Republicans in the Sen-
ate. 
We live in the United States of Amer-
ica, the richest country in the history 
of this planet, yet as we gather here 
today, close to 40 million of our fellow 
citizens don’t know where their next 
meal is going to come from. There is 
not a single congressional district in 
America that is hunger-free. We ought 
to be ashamed of that. 
Hunger is a political condition. We 
can solve this problem, but we need to 
have the political will. This con-
ference, I hope, will provide that polit-
ical will. 
I will remind my colleagues the last 
time we had a conference on this sub-
ject was 54 years ago, so I am looking 
forward to working with the White 
House and my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to forge a path forward to 
end hunger in America once and for all. 
Madam Speaker, this rule also pro-
vides for consideration of a short-term 
continuing resolution that keeps the 
government funded at current levels 
through March 15 to give the United 
States Senate adequate time to pass 
this full-year omnibus agreement and 
get it to President Biden’s desk so that 
he can sign it. 
And in the wake of the unprovoked 
and horrific invasion of Ukraine at the 
hands of Russian President Vladimir 
Putin, this Congress is taking urgent 
bipartisan action to protect global 
peace and security and hold Putin’s 
corrupt regime accountable. 
Yesterday, I co-chaired a meeting of 
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Com-
mission. We had a detailed discussion 
about what was happening in Ukraine 
and the fact that what is happening has 
risen to the level of war crimes, and 
there needs to be accountability. 
We have all seen the awful pictures 
and the awful videos, Madam Speaker, 
families 
gunned 
down, 
apartment 
buildings bombed, and the indiscrimi-
nate use of force, yet still the people of 
Ukraine are courageously standing up 
for freedom. Congress, the Biden ad-
ministration, and the people of the 
United States must stand with them, 
and that is exactly what this measure 
does. 
By encouraging World Trade Organi-
zation members to suspend concessions 
to Russia; taking steps to review Rus-
sia’s international trade status; and, 
very importantly, by reauthorizing a 
strengthened Global Magnitsky Human 
Rights Accountability Act so that the 
United States can impose further sanc-
tions on human rights abusers in Rus-
sia and around the globe, America is 
standing up to bullies like Putin who 
think they can invade their way into 
an empire and blackmail the world 
with their oil. 
I want to commend President Biden 
for taking action to stop the import of 
Russian 
energy 
products 
into 
the 
United States, action which our legis-
lation supports. 
I should also say, Madam Speaker, 
that I had kind of hoped that this could 
have come up under suspension because 
I like to think there is no dissent on 
what we are doing in this legislation. I 
am concerned that some of my friends 
on the other side objected to the 
strengthening of human rights provi-
sions in the Magnitsky Act. 
Ironically, the language that we are 
using is language very similar to the 
executive order put forward by Presi-
dent Trump. I don’t agree with him on 
a lot of things—almost nothing—but I 
think he was right signing an executive 
order 
to 
actually 
strengthen 
the 
human 
rights 
criteria 
for 
the 
Magnitsky legislation. We ought to 
hold 
human 
rights 
abusers—those 
guilty of corruption—accountable. And 
for 
anybody—anybody—to 
want 
to 
weaken the standard and to want to let 
some people off the hook, I think, is 
unconscionable. So I hope there is a 
strong bipartisan vote on this. 
Finally, I want to highlight that our 
bipartisan omnibus agreement includes 
$13.6 billion in emergency military, hu-
manitarian, and economic support for 
Ukraine. This week, the United Na-
tions has warned that this is the ‘‘fast-
est growing refugee crisis in Europe 
since World War II.’’ I am proud that 
we are taking the moral obligation of 
humanitarian assistance seriously. 
Together, these measures, in addition 
to the strong leadership shown by 
President Biden working quickly and 
in close consultation with our allies 
and partners, have placed enormous 
pressure on President Putin and his 
corrupt oligarchs to end this war. I 
hope that he does that immediately. 
The final thing that I am going to 
say is to echo what I began with. This 
bill is not perfect through the eyes of 
anybody, whether you are a liberal 
Democrat like me or whether you are a 
conservative Republican, and this rule 
allows people to express their support 
and their lack of support for different 
parts of this bill very clearly. 
Some think that the defense section 
is too high. I personally do. But we 
have an opportunity to be able to vote 
yes or no on that. 
Some think that the investments in 
domestic spending are too high. I think 
they are not high enough, but what-
ever. People have an opportunity to be 
able to vote yes or no on that. 
So, I hope that we can get support for 
the rule. I hope that we can get this 
legislation passed today, sent over to 
the Senate, and help the American peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my very good friend, the distinguished 
gentleman from Massachusetts, Chair-
man MCGOVERN, for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Today’s rule covers three items. The 
first item is a bill to ban imports of 
Russian oil into the United States and 
to impose additional sanctions fol-
lowing Russia’s unprovoked and unjust 
invasion of Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, although I will be 
supporting this bill, I cannot help but 
feel that this is a half measure and a 
missed opportunity to exhibit unified 
support on immediate steps to confront 
Putin’s evil regime. 
Yesterday, 
Senators 
WYDEN
and 
CRAPO introduced a much stronger bill, 
one that was negotiated over the week-
end by Republicans and Democrats in 
both the House and the Senate. But 
rather than taking yes for an answer, 
the majority instead put forward a 
weaker bill, one that is watered down 
and leaves loopholes wide enough to 
drive a tanker through. 
Banning Russian oil imports in the 
wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine should be an obvious no- 
brainer, just like it ought to be a no- 
brainer for the President to reverse his 
misguided policies and unleash devel-
opment 
of 
America’s 
own 
energy 
sources. But instead of doing so, the 
Biden administration continues to dis-
courage domestic oil and gas produc-
tion and is asking every other oil pro-
ducer in the world to make up the dif-
ference. 
Instead of encouraging our own do-
mestic sources of energy, which could 
meet our needs, critically supply our 
allies, and strengthen American energy 
independence, President Biden instead 
is taking steps like unilaterally can-
celing the Keystone XL pipeline, im-
posing a ban on new oil and gas explo-
ration and leasing on Federal lands, 
and telling hardworking Americans 
who are struggling to buy expensive 
gasoline to instead go buy more expen-
sive electric vehicles. 
Failing to develop America’s energy 
resources is a missed opportunity, 
Madam Speaker, just like this bill. We 
had a better option. I wish we had 
taken it. 
Our second item today is an omnibus 
appropriations package covering the 
remainder of the year 2022, and the 
third is a short-term continuing resolu-
tion to ensure continuity of govern-
ment funding while Congress processes 
a larger bill. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a very, 
very long road to get to this point. But

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1383 
March 9, 2022 
today, the House will act on a bipar-
tisan, bicameral appropriations pack-
age. As vice ranking member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, I am encour-
aged that we are finally nearing com-
pletion of this fundamental function of 
Congress to provide full-year funding 
for the government. 
We are here today in a time of great 
crisis. Two weeks ago, Russian Presi-
dent 
Vladimir 
Putin 
launched 
an 
unprovoked and unjust war against 
Ukraine, its democratic neighbor to 
the west. Inflation has skyrocketed to 
a 40-year high, and due to the adminis-
tration’s reckless action, gas prices 
have continued to soar month after 
month after month. 
b 0930 
Yet despite these crises, the Members 
of this body have worked together and 
have found common ground on today’s 
legislation. 
As I have said many times, one of the 
most consequential duties of a Member 
of Congress is to fund the government 
and keep it open and operating. At a 
time of crisis, this is more important 
than ever. 
Last year, the Appropriations Com-
mittee passed all 12 appropriations 
bills out of committee and succeeded in 
passing nine of those bills across the 
floor before the August recess. Unfor-
tunately, these bills were partisan and 
did not receive support from any Re-
publican Members, with good reason. 
Today, we are 5 months into fiscal 
year 2022, and despite the long process, 
the path forward has always been clear. 
It was clear last July, just as it is clear 
today. 
In order to reach a final bipartisan, 
bicameral deal on appropriations for 
FY 2022, four conditions needed to be 
met. I am greatly pleased that this bill 
meets all four. 
The first is to ensure that the long-
standing, bipartisan pro-life provisions 
historically included in the appropria-
tions bills are restored. These include 
the Hyde amendment, which prevents 
Federal dollars from being used to pay 
for abortions, except in limited cases of 
rape, incest, and the life of the mother, 
and the Weldon amendment, which pro-
tects American doctors, nurses, and 
other healthcare professionals from 
participating in and providing abor-
tions if they have a moral objection. 
The inclusion of these and other 
broadly popular provisions was and is 
an absolute necessity for this bill to 
have any chance of becoming law. I am 
personally deeply grateful that they 
are included in this package. 
Second, partisan policy riders that 
were included in the bills that passed 
the House last summer needed to come 
out. These are provisions that both 
sides did not agree to and do not enjoy 
bipartisan consensus. At the end of the 
day, we needed to reach an agreement 
on these items to move forward. Fortu-
nately, each of these provisions has 
been removed. 
Third, the level of defense spending 
absolutely needed to come up. Unfortu-
nately, last year, President Biden pro-
posed a budget that underfunded na-
tional defense, repeating the mistake 
of the Obama-Biden administration of 
chronically underfunding our national 
defense. But earlier this year, the 
House Armed Services Committee and 
the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
both controlled by Democrats, worked 
together in a bipartisan manner to au-
thorize an increase in defense spending 
of $25 billion over the fiscal year. 
In today’s bill, appropriators actu-
ally went beyond that, ensuring a ro-
bust increase in defense spending. This 
increase is necessary to ensure that 
our Armed Forces will have the funds 
needed to maintain our readiness and 
to procure the weapons and assets the 
warfighters of tomorrow will need to 
continue to succeed on the battlefield. 
This includes increases for defense 
assets based in my own home State of 
Oklahoma. If the present crisis in 
Ukraine shows us nothing else, it 
should show us the need to continue to 
adequately fund our national defense. 
Finally, the fourth condition that 
needed to be met was that the proposed 
levels of nondefense spending had to 
come down. In the initial set of bills 
that passed the House, my friends in 
the majority sought to include a 17 per-
cent increase in nondefense spending. 
While that no doubt included many 
worthy items, Republicans generally 
felt that 17 percent was excessive, par-
ticularly given the substantial needs 
on the defense side of the ledger. 
But the bill before us today increases 
nondefense spending by just 6.7 per-
cent, which will allow for increased in-
vestments in key areas while also en-
suring that we will continue to be re-
sponsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
Of course, this 6.7 percent ensures 
that there will be significant and im-
portant 
investments 
in 
nondefense 
areas across the government. I am par-
ticularly pleased that the National In-
stitutes of Health will receive a robust 
$2.25 billion increase, which will help 
advance medical science, help address 
future pandemics, and continue our 
progress toward defeating the scourge 
of cancer. 
We are also funding ARPA-H, one of 
the President’s highest priorities, at $1 
billion in its first year of operation. I 
am also encouraged that this bill pro-
vides significant increases for TRIO 
and GEAR UP, two programs that are 
close to my heart, that help first-gen-
eration students go to college. These 
are just a few of the programs that I 
could point to that are worthy of in-
creased funding and investment, and 
this bill has done that. 
The legislation before us today rep-
resents a negotiated compromise be-
tween the House and the Senate and 
obviously between Democrats and Re-
publicans. Given that, it is a com-
promise. That means neither side got 
everything that they wanted. As I have 
often said, in a compromise, you have 
to give up more than you would like to 
get less than you want. Indeed, this is 
not the bill I would have written had I 
written it alone. But at the end of the 
day, it represents a good balance for 
Congress and for the Nation. 
Before I finish, I want to congratu-
late my friends and colleagues on the 
Appropriations 
Committee, 
particu-
larly Chairwoman ROSA DELAURO and 
Ranking Member KAY GRANGER, with-
out whom we would not have gotten to 
where we are today. 
I also want to extend my huge thank 
you, as the chairman did, to the Appro-
priations Committee staff and to the 
Rules staff on both sides of the aisle. 
These staffers are truly unsung heroes 
who spent many long and sleepless 
nights over the preceding weeks, in-
cluding this past weekend. We would 
not be here today without them. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just say that I have enormous 
respect for the gentleman from Okla-
homa. There is this old adage that says 
you don’t have to agree on everything 
to agree on something. Much of what 
he cited is something that I think we 
can all agree on: investments in med-
ical research, support for the NIH, in-
vestments in trying to find ways to 
manage and cure cancer. All of those 
things are incredibly important, and I 
think they bring us together. 
Some of the things he said I disagree 
with. I believe it is a mistake to deny 
women their legal reproductive rights, 
and I think the defense budget is way 
too big. Spending more on something 
doesn’t necessarily get you a better re-
sult. We need to spend more efficiently 
and more effectively. We have a mili-
tary budget that is so bloated, that is 
so excessive, so filled with cost over-
runs, that even Dr. Strangelove would 
be impressed. We need to do better. 
Having said that, I am aware that we 
have to be able to deal on legislation 
within the reality that we live in. We 
have a 50/50 Senate; we have a majority 
here in the House, not as big as I would 
like. Hopefully, that changes in No-
vember. But the bottom line is, we 
have to work with what we have. I 
think that is what has occurred here. 
We continue to hear this claim that 
President Biden’s climate policies are 
somehow to blame for the latest spike 
in gas prices. I think we need to just 
set the record straight here. Domestic 
energy production is up, it is rising, 
and it is approaching records. There 
are over 9,000 approved drilling permits 
the oil industry is not using. The truth 
is that changes in domestic energy pol-
icy often take years to impact global 
energy markets. 
Instead, what is happening here is oil 
companies are using Putin’s war as an 
excuse to jack up prices at the pump 
even more. They argue for looser regu-
lations, cheaper drilling, and more pol-
lution. 
This is Putin’s price hike. Quite 
frankly, at this time of global crisis, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1384 
March 9, 2022 
would like to appeal to the patriotism 
of Big Oil in this country to not make 
record profits their priority, to actu-
ally put the American people’s interest 
and, in fact, the global interest first. 
Let’s not fool ourselves that greed isn’t 
at play here. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a March 4 opinion article writ-
ten by the House Natural Resources 
Committee Chairman RAUL GRIJALVA, 
entitled ‘‘Oil and gas lobbyists are 
using Ukraine to push for a drilling 
free-for-all in the U.S.’’ 
[From the Guardian, Mar. 4, 2022] 
OIL AND GAS LOBBYISTS ARE USING UKRAINE 
TO PUSH FOR A DRILLING FREE-FOR-ALL IN 
THE US 
(By Rau´ l M Grijalva) 
Last week, we all watched in horror as 
Vladimir Putin launched a deadly, cata-
strophic attack on Ukraine, violating inter-
national treaties across the board. Most of 
us swiftly condemned his actions and pledged 
support for the Ukrainian people whose 
country, homes and lives are under attack. 
But the fossil-fuel industry had a different 
take. They saw an opportunity—and a 
shameless one at that—to turn violence and 
bloodshed into an oil and gas propaganda- 
generating scheme. Within hours, industry- 
led talking points were oozing into press re-
leases, social media and opinion pieces, tell-
ing us the key to ending this crisis is to im-
mediately hand US public lands and waters 
over to fossil-fuel companies and quickly 
loosen the regulatory strings. 
Our top priority must be ending Putin’s 
hostilities, but as chair of the US House 
committee on natural resources, I feel duty- 
bound to set the record straight. We can’t let 
the fossil-fuel industry scare us into a do-
mestic drilling free-for-all that is neither 
economically 
warranted 
nor 
environ-
mentally sound. 
Despite industry’s claims to the contrary, 
President Biden has not hobbled US oil and 
gas development. In fact, much to my deep 
disappointment and protest, this administra-
tion actually approved more US drilling per-
mits per month in 2021 than President 
Trump did during each of the first three 
years of his presidency. Before the pandemic, 
oil and gas production from public lands and 
waters reached an all-time high, and the cur-
rent administration has done little to change 
that trajectory over the last 13 months. 
Fossil-fuel companies and their backers in 
Congress also profess that more drilling on 
public lands and waters would lower gas 
prices for Americans. But if that’s true, why 
hasn’t record oil extraction from both fed-
eral and non-federal lands over the last dec-
ade done anything to consistently lower, or 
at least stabilize, prices at the pump? 
The fact is that crude oil is a volatile glob-
al commodity. Worldwide supply, demand, 
and unpredictable events—like wars—influ-
ence the price of gas, not the current admin-
istration’s decision to approve a few new 
leases or permits. 
Even if we take industry’s claims at face 
value, nothing is keeping fossil-fuel compa-
nies from more drilling on public lands right 
now. The oil industry already controls at 
least 26m acres of public land and is sitting 
on more than 9,000 approved drilling permits 
they’re not using. 
They have a similarly gratuitous surplus 
offshore, where nearly 75% of their active 
federal oil and gas leases, covering over 8m 
acres, have yet to produce a single drop. Any 
new leases issued today wouldn’t produce 
anything of value for years, or even decades 
in some cases. 
If industry did start to ramp up production 
from federal leases, the overall increase to 
the total US supply would likely be mar-
ginal. In 2020, public lands and waters only 
accounted for 22% and 11% of oil and gas pro-
duction, respectively. The vast majority of 
oil and gas resources are beneath state and 
private lands—not public lands or federal 
waters. 
With the facts laid bare, we see the fossil- 
fuel industry’s crocodile tears for what they 
are—the same old demands for cheaper leases 
and looser regulations they’ve been peddling 
for decades. These pleas have nothing to do 
with countering Putin’s invasion or stabi-
lizing gas prices, and everything to do with 
making oil and gas development as easy and 
profitable as possible. 
The US is the world’s top oil and gas pro-
ducer. Doubling down on fossil fuels is a false 
solution that only perpetuates the problems 
that got us here in the first place. 
And quite frankly, we can’t afford to main-
tain the status quo. In its newest report the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) issued its most dire warning yet on 
the rapidly accelerating climate crisis. If we 
fail to enact major mitigation efforts, like 
curbing fossil-fuel development, both quick-
ly and substantially, we will ‘‘miss a brief 
and rapidly closing window of opportunity to 
secure a livable and sustainable future for 
all’’. 
Fortunately, there is a path forward that 
simultaneously cuts the lifeline to fossil-fuel 
despots like Putin, stabilizes energy prices 
here at home, and creates a safer, more sus-
tainable planet. We must wean ourselves off 
our oil and gas dependence and make trans-
formational investments in cleaner renew-
able energy technologies, like those in the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Build 
Back Better Act and the Competes Act, and 
we must do it now. 
The fossil-fuel industry has had hold of the 
microphone for far too long. It’s time we let 
the facts speak for themselves. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentleman for yield-
ing, and let me add my appreciation to 
Chairwoman ROSA DELAURO and Rank-
ing Member GRANGER and admit that 
the world now sees this every day in 
American newspapers and around the 
world: the pillage, the desperation, the 
violence, and the death of women and 
children in Ukraine, the worst humani-
tarian crisis that we have seen in a 
century and the absolute outrage of 
the killing machine that Putin is and 
the terroristic acts. He is a war crimi-
nal. 
I rise today to support H.R. 6968 and 
to thank my friend from Texas (Mr. 
DOGGETT) for joining us together to be 
able to move forward on language that 
works to hold Russia accountable for 
its invasion of Ukraine by denying its 
preferential trade treatment and seek-
ing to remove it from the World Trade 
Organization. 
This legislation bans Russian energy 
imports 
and 
suspends 
preferential 
trade treatment with Belarus. I was at 
the border of Belarus as it was hosting 
30,000 to 40,000 Russian troops and its 
reckless attitude of incarcerating and 
detaining its own political opposition. 
The head of Belarus is no better. 
The President receives the ability to 
further increase tariffs on Russian or 
Belarusian goods. Congress is empow-
ered to disapprove any Presidential de-
cision to restore normal trade relations 
or to remove the import ban. 
It further closes yet another avenue 
for Russian participation in the world 
economy by revoking most-favored-na-
tion status dealing with exports as well 
as its participation in world trade and 
denying Belarus membership. 
Further, with this ban on Russian en-
ergy imports, Americans will no longer 
be contributing to Putin’s most violent 
actions. He is a war criminal. He is 
killing children. 
Let me also rise in support of H.R. 
2471. I call it working Americans re-
sponse act. It is an appropriation that 
deals with healthcare and education. It 
deals with climate change, and it also 
deals with responding to the needs of 
the American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it additionally responds to the poten-
tial of those that are facing domestic 
violence and sexual assault with the 
Violence Against Women Act that I led 
and had passed in this House just a few 
months ago. 
So let me say that this is a job well 
done to all of those who have been 
working but let us do this in a bipar-
tisan manner. 
The people of Ukraine cry out in 
pain. Russia is now brought to its 
knees. Let’s make sure that Vladimir 
Putin never stands on the world stage 
again. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
just quickly respond to my friend’s 
comment about the energy industry. 
I am from an energy district. I am 
from an energy State. My constituents 
and their forebearers have produced 
more energy than they have consumed 
for over a hundred years, and they have 
shared it all over the world, but par-
ticularly across this country. 
Thank God for them because, quite 
frankly, what Americans would be pay-
ing at the pump now would be astro-
nomical were it not for them. Since 
2005, American oil production has dou-
bled, and that is due to their ingenuity. 
Frankly, we pay almost the lowest en-
ergy prices in the world. 
I am sorry, but to put all of these en-
ergy price increases off on Vladimir 
Putin—he is certainly responsible for 
those this week, but the reality is, for 
the entire Biden Presidency, energy 
prices have been going up. That is be-
cause the President, on his very first 
day, effectively declared war on the 
fossil fuel industry. He canceled the 
Keystone Pipeline. He changed the 
leasing and drilling rules on Federal 
lands. The hostility has simply been 
overwhelming. 
Now, where does that put us? The 
United States is going to Iran to ask 
them to increase energy production, 
the largest sponsor of state tyranny.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1385 
March 9, 2022 
We are sending representatives to 
Venezuela. Why don’t we just call peo-
ple in Houston and Oklahoma City and 
Cheyenne? We have got lots of places 
that know how to produce energy and 
have been doing it cheaply, efficiently, 
fairly, and cleanly for decades. 
The reality is, let’s not attack them. 
They are our salvation in a time of 
trial, and they are our national secu-
rity moving forward. I feel very strong-
ly about that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS), my good friend and distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee and the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
b 0945 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
also am from an energy State, and I 
want to associate myself with the re-
marks of Ranking Member COLE as far 
as the energy industry is concerned. 
Quite correct, the hostility of the 
Biden administration to American en-
ergy was front and center from day one 
when the President took the oath of of-
fice, and it is only the last 6 weeks that 
we have seen the hostility from Putin 
and Russia, but the seeds were set for 
record high energy prices because of 
the activities of the Biden administra-
tion and the Democratic leadership in 
this Congress, quite frankly. 
But I am here today to speak about 
the spending bill that is in front of us. 
Halfway through the fiscal year, we fi-
nally have the appropriations bills for 
the spending for this year, and I am 
grateful to see a copy on the Speaker’s 
desk. That is the only copy that I have 
seen. Certainly, we didn’t have a copy 
last night in the Rules Committee. 
I am gratified to know that there ac-
tually does exist a copy of this spend-
ing bill; but, once again, no Member of 
the people’s House has really had the 
opportunity to look at and weigh in on, 
no ability to amend last night in the 
Rules Committee, no ability to really 
affect this massive spending bill that is 
in front of us. 
I planned to offer several amend-
ments to improve this bill. The public 
health mandates are easing around the 
country, but the Department of Trans-
portation still requires patrons to wear 
masks on public transportation, on air-
lines. This could and should be re-
scinded, and this was an opportunity to 
do just that. 
As Mr. COLE mentioned, we are expe-
riencing some of the highest gas prices 
in over a decade, maybe even in this 
generation, and no funds in this bill 
should be expended to restrict the oper-
ation or development of oil and gas 
pipelines to get that vitally needed en-
ergy out of places like the Permian 
Basin to population centers—Dallas, 
Houston, Oklahoma City—where they 
can be consumed or where they can be 
liquefied and exported to other coun-
tries. 
Federal agencies are behind, vet-
erans’ 
services 
are 
severely 
back-
logged. I would have loved to have sub-
mitted an amendment to appropriate 
some additional dollars, $2 billion, to 
the Department of Veterans Affairs so 
that they could relieve this backlog for 
our veterans. And, in fact, the budget 
neutrality requirements in the Medi-
care physician fee schedule could have 
been waived, and we could have done so 
with the excess funds in the Provider 
Relief Fund and given our frontline 
health personnel a little bit of a break 
from the fact that they have been on 
the front lines battling the coronavirus 
for 2 years, and what do they get for 
that effort? A pay cut. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Texas an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, the 
Congressional Budget Office did pro-
vide to the Budget Committee, of 
which I am also a member, a list of the 
top 20 agencies that are overfunded 
with funds that have been appropriated 
over the last 2 years. The totality of 
those 20 accounts is $340 billion. There 
were moneys available. A lot of things 
that are in this bill could have been 
offset if we had simply taken the time 
to do it. I will say, since I am a mem-
ber of the authorizing committee, 
going forward our authorizing commit-
tees have to do their work. They have 
to do the study because we can’t expect 
it to all happen at the Appropriations 
Committee at the eleventh hour. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is impor-
tant that people be able to see where 
those moneys exist. The results of the 
study, which was compiled by the Con-
gressional Budget Office, are contained 
on a spreadsheet and can be found at: 
https://burgess.house.gov/ 
UploadedFiles/COB-UnspentCOVID.pdf. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I want to correct the record on one 
thing. The gentleman said he didn’t get 
a copy of the text of what we are con-
sidering here today. It was put into his 
Dropbox, and he could have downloaded 
it. It was emailed to his staff. It was 
posted online. Yeah, we didn’t print off 
a 3,000-page bill because I believe in 
saving trees. But it was available, and 
I just want to point that out for the 
record. I will also just say—and again 
with great respect for my two col-
leagues on the Rules Committee—I 
don’t share their enthusiasm about big 
oil companies. I just don’t. They are 
making all-time-high record profits 
while Americans are paying more at 
the gas pump. 
I will remind my friends that when 
Donald Trump was President, we had 
unemployment at about 14.9 percent, 
which was terrible. It is now down to 
3.8 percent, which is driving up de-
mand. Nobody is questioning the fact 
that there is a supply-and-demand 
problem here. But we also ought to un-
derstand that part of these price hikes, 
in addition to the Putin price hike, is 
the oil company price hike, and as we 
try to figure out how to alleviate the 
burden on the American people, which 
we are trying to do, we also have to fig-
ure out how we do it in a way where 
any savings or any tax incentives that 
we might provide are actually passed 
on to the consumer because the oil in-
dustry in this country, the big oil com-
panies, have a history of price gouging, 
and the fact that they are doing it now 
I think is unconscionable. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
will refrain from correcting my friend 
again and just send him something to 
read. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
bring up H.R. 6858, the American En-
ergy Independence from Russia Act for 
immediate consideration. 
Two weeks ago, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin shocked the world by 
launching 
a 
full-scale 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. In doing so, Mr. Putin re-
vealed his true self, and that is a bully, 
a thug, a tyrant bent on subverting his 
democratic neighbor to the west. In 
challenging not only Ukraine, but also 
the rest of the civilized world, Mr. 
Putin’s powerful weapon is not his 
army, potent though that may be, but 
the dependence of much of the rest of 
the world on Russian oil and gas. Al-
ready he has begun to put the squeeze 
on democratic states seeking to chal-
lenge his invasion of Ukraine by 
threatening to cut off their supplies of 
energy. 
The American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act would address the 
challenge and would reposition the 
United States to be energy self-suffi-
cient. It would immediately approve 
the Keystone XL pipeline, would re-
start oil and gas leasing on Federal 
lands and waters, and would expand 
liquid natural gas exports at the mo-
ment Europe needs the most. In doing 
so, it would ensure that America re-
mains energy independent and can act 
to address Russian aggression without 
risking economic damage. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD along with 
extraneous material immediately prior 
to the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CRENSHAW), my good friend and a 
distinguished member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, to further 
explain our amendment. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
we 
can 
immediately 
consider 
the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act, led by my friend and the 
Republican leader of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, CATHY MCMOR-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1386 
March 9, 2022 
This week our President, our Amer-
ican President, asked Venezuela and 
Saudi Arabia to increase oil produc-
tion, asked them to boost their output 
so that American consumers wouldn’t 
see a spike in gas prices. 
It seems like a noble cause at first 
glance, but I couldn’t help to think to 
myself what a strange thing to ask be-
cause surely he knows that we can also 
boost domestic production right here 
at home. Surely he knows that domes-
tic production supports American jobs, 
and surely he knows that domestic pro-
duction is cleaner, by far, than foreign 
production; far better for the environ-
ment than Venezuelan oil unless that 
Socialist dictator suddenly became a 
devout green energy disciple without 
any of us knowing it. 
Surely President Biden knows that 
energy demand doesn’t just disappear 
because you tell middle-class Ameri-
cans to go buy a Tesla. Surely he 
knows all of this, right? The answer is, 
of course, yes, he does know that, and 
the entire Democratic Party knows 
this. It is impossible not to know these 
things because these things are called 
hard facts. They are indisputable. 
Those facts are simple and worth re-
peating. 
Number 1: The world will demand at 
least 50 percent more energy in the 
next 50 years. That is a fact. 
Number 2: The energy demanded will 
be reliable energy; electricity that 
turns on when you want it, heat that 
keeps you alive in the winter, and air 
conditioning that keeps you cool in the 
summer. 
Fact number 3: Solar and wind can-
not and will not ever provide this reli-
able energy, no matter how often you 
worship and pray to the deities of wind 
turbines and solar panels; proudly 
made, of course, by the Communist 
genocidal country of China. 
Fact number 4: American production 
of oil and gas is far cleaner than any 
other country, except maybe Canada. 
These are indisputable facts. So 
where does that leave us? For anyone 
wise in the ways of common sense, it 
leads to one conclusion. It is in the 
American interest to pursue absolute 
American energy dominance. If you 
don’t believe me, let’s outline the al-
ternative. Let’s imagine we go the way 
of Germany and invest half a trillion 
dollars in building out unreliable wind 
and solar production, only to watch 
our energy prices rise faster than any-
where else and yet still be forced to 
turn on coal plants and import Russian 
gas because your green energy just 
doesn’t work the way you wanted it to. 
The rest of Europe wasn’t all that 
different. They increased their reliance 
on Russian gas from 10 percent to over 
40 percent now, and I cannot help but 
notice that the Democratic Party 
seems intent on pursuing this very 
path, canceling leases and pipelines, in-
creasing regulations, chastising our in-
dustry. If no one else here noticed, 
someone in Russia certainly did. 
Fast forward to 2022, and Putin, with 
his newfound leverage over European 
energy supply, realizes it may just be 
the right time to exercise his impe-
rialistic ambitions and retake the old 
Soviet territory of Ukraine, leaving 
thousands of innocents dead and a 
Western world order completely upend-
ed. 
We are all left thinking the same 
thought, wouldn’t it be better if it was 
America supplying Europe its energy? 
Wouldn’t it be better if Europe wasn’t 
held hostage to the whims of a dic-
tator? Wouldn’t it be better if we didn’t 
have to wonder where the extra oil 
would come from after we rightfully 
ban Russian imports? 
Most of us are thinking that, of 
course. Unfortunately, those in the ma-
jority, those in power are not. I pray 
that you start. 
We should defeat the previous ques-
tion, pass the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act and pursue 
true American energy dominance. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Give me a break. I hope my friends 
know better, and I hope they know 
what drives the price of oil. They talk 
as if there is just one little switch you 
can turn on. I hear them talking, just 
bring the Keystone pipeline back on-
line. By the way, it was never built, 
and it was years away from bringing 
any oil to the United States—foreign 
oil, by the way; Canada is another 
country. Even if it were built, we are 
told it may lower prices by maybe one 
cent a gallon and lock us into the same 
dependence on fossil fuels that got us 
into this mess to begin with. 
We have been arguing for years with 
my friends to make the transition 
away from fossil fuels to greener, 
cleaner energy so every time there is a 
world crisis we are not having this dis-
cussion, but instead they continue to 
be in the pockets of the oil companies. 
Follow the money. Follow the money. 
Look where the oil companies are put-
ting their money. 
By the way, when they say we should 
do more drilling, the oil companies 
now have been provided 9,000 new drill-
ing permits on public lands. Much to 
my disappointment, the Biden adminis-
tration is actually outpacing even the 
Trump administration in approving 
new drilling permits on public lands 
and water. So give me a break. 
Here is the reality, and let me spell it 
out for my friends; and I think they 
know better, but again it is politics as 
usual: Oil is a global commodity. 
Prices rise when supply chains are dis-
rupted or demand is interrupted, like 
we saw during COVID. Prices rise when 
oil-producing countries launch desta-
bilizing invasions; and, yes, when oil 
companies think they can use either of 
these as an excuse to jack up the 
prices, they do. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a March 4 article from News-
week entitled, ‘‘’Little Evidence’ Key-
stone Pipeline Would Level Prices De-
spite GOP Claims.’’ 
[From Newsweek, Mar. 4, 2022] 
‘LITTLE EVIDENCE’ KEYSTONE PIPELINE 
WOULD LEVEL PRICES DESPITE GOP CLAIMS 
(By Alexandra Hutzler) 
Republicans are hitting President Joe 
Biden over his decision to cancel the Key-
stone XL pipeline as gas prices rise across 
the country in the wake of Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. 
Former Vice President Mike Pence said 
last week ‘‘gas prices have risen across the 
country because of this Administration’s war 
on energy—shutting down the Keystone 
Pipeline, shutting down oil and gas leases in 
this country—while they were incomprehen-
sibly green-lighting the Nord Stream 2 deal 
for the Russians.’’ 
Senator Tim Scott told Fox News on 
Wednesday canceling the pipeline was ‘‘cata-
strophic’’ and that ‘‘the prices we’re seeing 
today are reflective of his decisions a year 
ago, not reflective of the conflict that start-
ed days ago.’’ 
But James Glynn, a senior research schol-
ar at Columbia University’s Center on Global 
Energy Policy, said the Keystone pipeline— 
even if operational—likely wouldn’t have 
had an impact on the global energy markets. 
‘‘There is little evidence to back up the ar-
gument that Keystone XL would have avert-
ed some of this price spike,’’ Glynn told 
Newsweek. ‘‘The Keystone pipeline capacity 
is less than one-tenth of Russian oil ex-
ports.’’ 
‘‘Even if Keystone XL was filled with fully 
additional Canadian export capacity, which 
would have been an unlikely scenario, it 
would not balance the global oil markets 
where the price of oil is set through a global 
arbitrage of the last marginal available bar-
rel,’’ Glynn continued. 
The current national average for a gallon 
of gasoline is $3.837, according to the Amer-
ican Automobile Association (AAA). That’s 
an increase of over 20 cents from the na-
tional average reported the week before. 
The White House has also emphasized that 
the Keystone Pipeline was never running, 
and was less than 10 percent completed when 
the project was shut down, amid criticism 
from the Republican Party. 
‘‘The Keystone Pipeline has never been 
operational,’’ press secretary Jen Psaki told 
reporters on Thursday ‘‘It would take years 
to have any impact. I know a number of 
members of Congress have suggested that, 
but that is a proposed solution that has no 
relationship or would have no impact on 
what the problem is we, here, all agree is an 
issue.’’ 
The pipeline project would have expanded 
an existing conduit for transporting tar- 
sands oil from Canada through the U.S. to 
the Gulf Coast. After years of legal chal-
lenges and environmental activism to shut 
the project down, the company behind it offi-
cially halted construction in June 2021 after 
Biden revoked a key permit. 
‘‘The Keystone pipeline is not a viable so-
lution because you can’t build a pipeline in 
an hour, right?’’ David Sacco, a practitioner 
in residence in the finance program at the 
University of New Haven, told Newsweek. 
‘‘The company that was building it shut it 
down a year ago. So that’s not viable. But I 
think the argument that our energy policies 
have been a pretty significant contribution 
to this [crisis] are certainly valid from an 
economic standpoint.’’ 
Sacco said there’s an argument to be made 
that the U.S. and other nations purchasing 
oil from Russia has ‘‘allowed their economy 
to strengthen, has allowed Putin to basically 
fund his military and expansion policies.’’ 
In addition to rising prices, Republicans 
have hit the Biden administration for energy 
policies they say make the U.S. more de-
pendent on foreign oil.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1387 
March 9, 2022 
‘‘Biden has given up the best defense we 
had against Putin’s evil vision for the 
world—energy independence,’’ Senator Mar-
sha Blackburn said in a statement this week. 
‘‘We need to make America energy inde-
pendent again. It’s time to divest from Rus-
sian energy and stop funding Putin’s war, 
and reauthorize the Keystone Pipeline.’’ 
One energy proposal that has received bi-
partisan support on Capitol Hill is to ban 
Russian oil imports. House Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi said Thursday she was ‘‘all for’’ the 
proposal. 
While Biden has said ‘‘nothing is off the 
table,’’ the administration has so far resisted 
slapping Moscow’s energy sector with sanc-
tions because it could further drive up prices 
at the gas pumps. 
Sacco said he believed gas prices could go 
up to $5 per gallon as the Russia-Ukraine cri-
sis unfolds. 
Biden has said it’s a priority for his team 
to ease the financial burden on Americans as 
prices rise. The administration just an-
nounced it is coordinating with other na-
tions to release 60 million barrels of oil in 
global reserves, half of which would come 
from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
‘‘The American people understand that de-
fending democracy and liberty is never with-
out cost,’’ Biden said last month while 
speaking on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
also urge all my colleagues to do a lit-
tle research and look at the profits of 
Big Oil in this country. Look at what 
they are making. While Americans are 
paying more at the pump, their execu-
tives are making more and more and 
more. You can defend Big Oil if you 
want. And I get it, maybe there is some 
benefit politically to doing that. Again, 
follow the money. But I have to tell 
you, I think people are sick of this. We 
have seen this movie before. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOG-
GETT). 
b 1000 
Mr. DOGGETT. This rule makes 
proper for our consideration legislation 
that I have offered to respond to the 
brutal aggression of Vladimir Putin de-
stroying, hour by hour, Ukraine, and 
its people, with death and destruction. 
I am pleased to hear from the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma that he sup-
ports this legislation because it will be 
stronger if we are united in sending 
this message. 
Like so many Americans, I have 
watched the horrors in Ukraine. I have 
seen the people standing with their 
blue and yellow Ukraine banners and 
flags on the steps of the State capitol 
in Austin day after day, rain and shine, 
to express their concern. 
And like them, and like so many of 
us of all political persuasions, we won-
der what we can do to prevent what is 
happening that we see played out, in 
real time, on our televisions? 
Well, in my case, it has been advo-
cating that we get all of the weapons 
that Ukrainians need to defend them-
selves to them yesterday. Immediately. 
But to recognize that to put a 
squeeze on the Russian empire, we 
should respond with the most effective 
sanctions that we can. One of those 
sanctions arising out of the Ways and 
Means Trade Subcommittee is the abil-
ity to respond with reference to the 
World Trade Organization and Russia. 
The week before last, I introduced 
with Mr. BLUMENAUER, the chairman of 
that subcommittee, legislation con-
cerning the trade status of the Russian 
Federation. 
The legislation that I introduced yes-
terday that this rule puts into effect is 
different from that, and I will discuss 
that in the course of our consideration 
of the bill. 
But it continues to urge the expelling 
of Russia from the World Trade Organi-
zation, which I think we should do to 
attempt to isolate as completely as we 
can Russia from any benefits from the 
world economy. 
To see now one American-owned 
company closing down hundreds of its 
locations 
throughout 
Russia, 
one 
American company, including some of 
the big oil companies withdrawing 
from the Russian Federation, they are 
acting in a way that supports what we 
need to do—put Russia in an economic 
vise. 
I believe that there is much more 
that we need to accomplish but that we 
respond today on the number one issue 
on the world agenda, and that is what 
is happening in Ukraine and what we 
can do to prevent it. 
Now, I understand some people con-
tinue to have their own ideological 
agenda to defend and ignore the cli-
mate crisis, deny climate science, and 
promote more and more fossil fuels. 
They choose the Keystone pipeline, 
which is exactly 8 percent completed. 
It uses the dirtiest form of oil in the 
tar sands. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Texas an ad-
ditional 1 minute. 
Mr. DOGGETT. From the cold tar 
sands of Canada, completing the Key-
stone 
pipeline 
will 
not 
save 
one 
Ukrainian life nor will the adoption of 
the rest of their agenda. 
Let me just say, I have only one 
agenda in this matter, and that is to 
respond to the aggression and do all we 
can to try to stop the brutal attacks 
unprovoked on the Ukrainian people. 
I am very pleased that this legisla-
tion that I introduced yesterday incor-
porates the good work of Chairman 
MCGOVERN on the Global Magnitsky 
Act. 
That is legislation that fits so well 
with what I have been urging about 
Russia because it combats human 
rights abuses there and all over the 
world. 
He has strengthened the provisions of 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky 
Act, 
which 
would have expired at the end of this 
year. By incorporating it, it fits well 
with our agenda to respond to Russian 
aggression and human rights abuses 
that are going on as people are being 
murdered as we speak today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, to fur-
ther discuss the need for America to be 
energy independent, I yield 2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
STAUBER), a member of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
and my good friend. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to the previous 
question so this Democrat-controlled 
House can finally do the right thing: 
pass the American Energy Independ-
ence from Russia Act. 
This morning, Americans are seeing 
even higher gas prices on their way to 
work than they saw on last night’s 
commute home. Sadly, tonight, tomor-
row morning, next week, and next 
month, they are going to see the same 
episode play out on those commutes to 
and from work over and over again. 
With the cost of living and inflation 
over the last year spiraling out of con-
trol, the last thing American families 
need is $7 to $8 a gallon gasoline. 
Due to the policies of President 
Biden, we are more reliant on Putin 
and Russian energy than in recent his-
tory. 
I agree that we must immediately 
halt the import of Russian oil and 
LNG. However, it is a false narrative 
pushed by President Biden that it 
should be an unavoidable hit to Ameri-
cans’ pocketbooks. This was avoidable, 
and it didn’t have to be this way. 
Since Biden’s first day in office, he 
has forced executive orders and sup-
ported policies that have made us more 
dependent on Russian energy. These 
policy choices are directly to blame for 
the increased pain at the pump that 
middle-class Americans are feeling. 
Take, for example, the opening line 
of an AP article 2 weeks ago: ‘‘The 
Biden administration is delaying deci-
sions on new oil and gas drilling on 
Federal land.’’ 
Sure, some of these leases are not 
utilized, but that is because they are 
tied up in litigation from far left anti- 
jobs groups or because they are await-
ing delayed approvals from the Biden 
administration. 
So, instead of approving rights-of- 
way, following the science, and putting 
our oil and gas developers to work, Joe 
Biden is making American families suf-
fer. 
On behalf of the American people, the 
Ukrainian people, and just basic com-
mon sense—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. I yield the gentleman 
from Minnesota an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Mr. STAUBER.—I joined my col-
leagues CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS and 
BRUCE
WESTERMAN
in 
offering 
an 
American energy solution. 
While Biden’s solution is to buy oil 
from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, our 
solution is to put blue-collar workers, 
American workers, to work here at 
home and develop our God-given nat-
ural resources. 
We have the ability to bring costs 
down by unleashing the economic en-
gine of American energy production.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1388 
March 9, 2022 
We can do that by defeating this pre-
vious question and passing the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We are all trying to figure out a way 
to alleviate the burden of energy costs 
on consumers. I mean, it is brutal for a 
lot of families in this country. 
Listening to some of the speeches 
here, I kind of feel like we should have 
an amendment that would require 
Members of Congress to take a basic 
course in economics to understand how 
supply and demand works. 
Again, the oil companies have 9,000 
leases that they are not utilizing as we 
speak. 
I include in the RECORD an article ti-
tled ‘‘Exclusive: Oil companies’ profits 
soared to $174 billion this year as U.S. 
gas prices rose.’’ 
[From the Guardian, Dec. 6, 2021] 
EXCLUSIVE: OIL COMPANIES’ PROFITS SOARED 
TO $174BN THIS YEAR AS US GAS PRICES ROSE 
(By Oliver Milman) 
The largest oil and gas companies made a 
combined $174bn in profits in the first nine 
months of the year as gasoline prices 
climbed in the US, according to a new re-
port. 
The bumper profit totals, provided exclu-
sively to the Guardian, show that in the 
third quarter of 2021 alone, 24 top oil and gas 
companies made more than $74bn in net in-
come. From January to September, the net 
income of the group, which includes Exxon, 
Chevron, Shell and BP, was $174bn. 
Exxon alone posted a net income of $6.75bn 
in the third quarter, its highest profit since 
2017, and has seen its revenue jump by 60% 
on the same period last year. The company 
credited the rising cost of oil for bolstering 
these profits, as did BP, which made $3.3bn 
in third-quarter profit. ‘‘Rising commodity 
prices certainly helped,’’ Bernard Looney, 
chief executive of BP, told investors at the 
latest earnings report. 
Gasoline prices have hit a seven-year high 
in the US due to the rising cost of oil, with 
Americans now paying about $3.40 for a gal-
lon of fuel compared with around $2.10 a year 
ago. 
The Biden administration has warned the 
price hikes are hurting low-income people, 
even as it attempts to implement a climate 
agenda that would see America move away 
from fossil fuels, and has released 50m bar-
rels of oil from the national strategic reserve 
to help dampen costs. 
But oil and gas companies have shown lit-
tle willingness so far to ramp up production 
to help reduce costs and the new report, by 
the government watchdog group Account-
able.US, accuses them of ‘‘taking advantage 
of bloated prices, fleecing American families 
along the way’’ amid ongoing fallout from 
the Covid–19 pandemic. 
‘‘Americans looking for someone to blame 
for the pain they experience at the pump 
need look no further than the wealthy oil 
and gas company executives who choose to 
line their own pockets rather than lower gas 
prices with the billions of dollars in profit 
big oil rakes in month after month,’’ said 
Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US. 
The analysis of major oil companies’ finan-
cials shows that 11 of the group gave payouts 
to shareholders worth more than $36.5bn col-
lectively this year, while a dozen bought 
back $8bn-worth of stock. This apparent 
focus, rather than on further drilling, has 
caused some frustration within the federal 
government, with Jennifer Granholm, the 
US energy secretary, stating that ‘‘the oil 
and gas companies are not flipping the 
switch as quickly as the demand requires.’’ 
A glut of new oil drilling has made the US 
awash with oil in recent years, turning the 
country into a top-level exporter as well as 
domestic supplier, but this has kept prices 
low to the displeasure of investors. 
‘‘A lot of this has been driven by investor 
sentiment,’’ said Helima Croft, head of glob-
al commodity strategy at RBC Capital Mar-
kets, of the current reluctance to expand 
production. ‘‘They don’t want them to spoil 
the party.’’ 
The situation has left the White House in 
an awkward position with its commitments 
to rapidly reduce planet-heating emissions, 
with environmentalists furious at adminis-
tration attempts to expand drilling and fos-
sil fuel companies also unhappy over some of 
its earlier climate-related moves, such as 
shutting down the controversial Keystone 
XL pipeline. 
The oil and gas industry has fought Joe 
Biden’s attempts to pause new drilling per-
mits on federal land, despite its unwilling-
ness to expand operations in order to reap 
the returns of costlier oil and the fact the in-
dustry currently sits on 14m acres of already 
leased land that isn’t being used, an area 
about double the size of Massachusetts. 
‘‘It’s not the government that is banning 
them from drilling more,’’ Pavel Molchanov, 
an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN. 
‘‘It’s pressure from their shareholders.’’ 
Aside from its role in the current high gas-
oline prices, the oil and gas industry is a 
leading driver of the climate crisis, the re-
ality of which it sought to conceal from the 
public for decades. and is a key instigator of 
the air pollution that kills nearly 9 million 
a year, a death toll three times that of the 
Covid–19 pandemic in 2020. 
The American Petroleum Institute, a lead-
ing industry lobby group, pointed to a blog 
that blamed the Biden administration for 
policies that ‘‘significantly weaken the in-
centives to invest in America’s energy fu-
ture’’ but did not answer questions on pro-
duction rates of oil companies. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
love the fact that we can’t even get 
anybody to express the slightest bit of 
outrage over the fact that oil compa-
nies are gouging us, making record 
profits, while Americans are paying 
more at the gas pump. 
I mean, I get it. They are very sup-
portive of some on the other side, but, 
I mean, give me a break. I think the 
American people understand this. 
We need to figure out a way to lower 
gas prices to alleviate the burden on 
working families here. But to get up 
and defend oil companies and oil com-
pany executives and put forward bills 
and ideas that are oil companies’ wish 
lists when they have 9,000 leases right 
now that they are not utilizing—and 
why? Because they are making record 
profits. 
I would also say to my colleagues 
that the underlying bill that we are 
dealing with here today contains a lot 
of good stuff. The gentleman from 
Oklahoma alluded to it in his opening 
remarks about the incredible invest-
ments in medical research. 
I was at the White House, as was the 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma, 
when 
President Biden announced the re-
launch of his Cancer Moonshot pro-
gram. I mean, the issue when it comes 
to curing cancer is not whether we can. 
The issue is when we will do it. That 
depends on investments. That depends 
on supporting innovation and medical 
research. This bill does that. That is a 
good thing. It should bring us all to-
gether. 
As we have talked about, we are 
going to deal with a bill to help 
Ukraine, especially with humanitarian 
assistance, given the refugee crisis. We 
are going to strengthen the Global 
Magnitsky law so that we have strong-
er human rights language, which some 
of my friends on the other side of the 
aisle, unfortunately, have opposed. 
I am reading in The New York Times 
today an article, ‘‘Republicans, Once 
Harsh Ukraine Critics, Pivot to Strong 
Support.’’ I am glad about that. I am 
hoping that the people who called 
Ukraine the most corrupt country in 
the world under the previous adminis-
tration will now at least vote to sup-
port that country as they are under at-
tack by Vladimir Putin. 
Anyway, there is some really good 
stuff in this bill, and I am looking for-
ward to getting to the debate on this. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Just to remind my friend, it was the 
last 
administration 
that 
actually 
began lethal aid to Ukraine. The 
Obama administration did not. The 
record there is pretty clear as to who 
has helped the Ukrainians. 
Madam Speaker, to further discuss 
the need to get America out from 
under the thumb of Russia, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER), a member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee and my good 
friend. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to oppose the previous ques-
tion so we can immediately pass the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. I would like to thank 
Ranking Member CATHY
MCMORRIS 
RODGERS for her leadership on this. 
Really, the question is simple. I 
think we are missing the point. The 
question here is: Is the President of the 
United States going to pick America, 
or is he going to pick our enemies? 
That is the debate here. 
Step one was great, and I am glad 
that we are going to support Ukraine. I 
was there 5 weeks ago; we need to sup-
port Ukraine. 
Step two is we need the President to 
support America. Energy security is 
national security, Mr. President. It is 
time to put Midland over Moscow. 
Unfortunately, 
that 
security 
has 
been under assault for decades but 
most recently beginning on January 20, 
2021. The administration is leading the 
assault on energy. The reality is that 
American energy is the cleanest in the 
world, but the President and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
refuse to acknowledge that fact and 
unleash it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1389 
March 9, 2022 
Instead, they are choosing, the Presi-
dent is choosing, our adversaries, ter-
rorists, and begging them to produce 
more when we can do it right here. 
Instead of calling on the 10 million 
Americans who do it every single day, 
we are outsourcing production to ad-
versaries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, 
and they are harming our environment 
even more. 
The war on Ukraine is horrifying, 
and it is heartbreaking. When I sat 
with President Zelensky, he said that 
the impetus to invade his country 
came from the fact that Nord Stream 
existed. 
Our President green-lighted Nord 
Stream but canceled the Keystone 
pipeline. Right now, today, there are 
six LNG terminals that the President, 
with the stroke of a pen, could approve. 
Are we going to pick the United 
States of America, or are we going to 
pick our adversaries? 
The United States should not be en-
ergy dependent. We should be energy 
dominant. Put Midland over Moscow. 
Unleash American LNG. Restart oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands, and 
protect our own country. Pick our 
country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman asked a question: Are 
we going to pick America or our adver-
saries? Interesting question. My friends 
on the other side have spent all of their 
time criticizing President Biden and 
very little mention of Putin. I think 
that says it all. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, for fur-
ther explanation of our energy inde-
pendence bill, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. 
BICE), my very good friend and fellow 
Oklahoman. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. COLE for yielding. 
I rise today in opposition to the pre-
vious question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 6858, the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. 
Gas prices are at a record high, and 
unfortunately, they will continue to 
rise. 
While 
the 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine has worsened the crisis, it is 
not the sole cause. The root cause of 
high energy and gas prices is due to the 
anti-energy policies of the Biden ad-
ministration, which suspended all oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands, slow- 
walked liquefied natural gas exports, 
and halted construction of the Key-
stone XL pipeline while green-lighting 
Russia’s Nord Stream 2. 
These steps allowed Putin to corner 
the energy market and fund his inva-
sion of Ukraine. American dollars can 
no longer go to countries whose inter-
ests run counter to America. 
b 1015 
America produces some of the clean-
est oil and gas in the world. If my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
want to lower emissions and promote 
clean energy, they would rely on Amer-
ican oil and gas production in States 
like my home State of Oklahoma, not 
foreign countries like Russia, Ven-
ezuela, and even Iran. 
Oklahomans are tired of inaction 
from Washington. They expect solu-
tions. We cannot continue to tap into 
the strategic petroleum reserve, which 
is at some of the lowest levels since 
2003. In addition, releasing 30 million 
barrels is only enough to meet our Na-
tion’s energy requirements for about a 
day. 
Sadly, this week House Democrats 
are not bringing forward a single piece 
of legislation to address the energy cri-
sis. 
Under the Trump administration, 
America was energy independent and a 
net total energy exporter for the first 
time since 1952. 
Madam Speaker, energy security is 
national security. Sadly, under this ad-
ministration, we have neither. 
Congress must act immediately to 
take up the American Energy Inde-
pendence From Russia Act. 
This 
legislation 
would 
promote 
America’s oil and natural gas produc-
tion and unleash American energy 
independence once again.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me

Everything is beautiful in its own way. 
In a few moments, I will withdraw 
this rule. It has been a long day, but we

front of us. I am excited about what we 
are about to do with the omnibus and 
the aid to Ukraine. We will finish it 
today. I feel pretty good. 
We will reconvene the Rules Com-

items before us. I expect the new rule 
to be on the floor pretty quickly. I 
hope we get bipartisan support for all 
these important measures. I don’t have

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 973 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 973 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the 
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 2471) to meas-
ure the progress of post-disaster recovery 
and efforts to address corruption, govern-
ance, rule of law, and media freedoms in 
Haiti, with the Senate amendment thereto, 
and to consider in the House, without inter-
vention of any point of order, a motion of-
fered by the chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations or her designee that the House 
concur in the Senate amendment with an 
amendment consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117-35 modified by the 
amendment printed in the report of the Com-
mittee on Rules accompanying this resolu-
tion. The Senate amendment and the motion 
shall be considered as read. The motion shall 
be debatable for one hour equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Appropriations 
or their respective designees. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the motion to its adoption without inter-
vening motion. The question of adoption of 
the motion shall be divided for a separate 
vote on all of the matter proposed to be in-
serted by the amendment of the House other 
than divisions B, C, F, X, and Z, and titles 2 
and 3 of division N. The two portions of the 
divided question shall be considered in the 
order specified by the Chair. If either portion 
of the divided question fails of adoption, 
then the House shall be considered to have 
made no disposition of the Senate amend-
ment. 
SEC. 2. The chair of the Committee on Ap-
propriations and the chair of the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence may insert 
in the Congressional Record not later than 
March 11, 2022, such material as they may 
deem explanatory of the Senate amendment 
and the motion specified in the first section 
of this resolution. 
SEC. 3. Upon adoption of this resolution it 
shall be in order to consider in the House the

b 1800 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), who is my good friend, 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a rule, House Resolution 973, providing 
for consideration of the Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act. It provides for a mo-
tion to concur in the Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 2471 with a House amend-
ment and self-executes a manager’s 
amendment. It divides the question on 
adoption of the motion into two votes 
in the order specified by the chair, and 
provides that if any portion of the di-
vided question fails, then the House 
shall be considered to have made no 
disposition on the Senate amendment. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.J. Res. 75, the Extension of 
Continuing Appropriations Act, under 
a closed rule, and provides one motion 
to recommit. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 6968, the Suspending Energy Im-
ports from Russia Act, under a closed 
rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 7007, the COVID Supplemental Ap-
propriations Act, under a closed rule, 
and provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations for 
H.R. 2471, H.J. Res. 75, and H.R. 7007. 
Finally, the rule tables House Reso-
lution 972. 
Madam Speaker, at this point, I am a 
big believer that less is more. I have 
spoken about the important aspects of 
what we are doing here today earlier, 
so I will not repeat it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everybody to 
support the rule and support the under-
lying legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank my good friend, the distin-
guished gentleman from Massachu-
setts, Chairman MCGOVERN, for yield-
ing me the customary 30 minutes, and 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, our second rule of 
the day now covers four items. As we 
discussed earlier, the first item is a bill 
to ban imports of Russian oil into the 
United States and to impose additional 
sanctions 
following 
Russia’s 
unprovoked and unjust invasion of 
Ukraine. 
Although I will be supporting this 
bill, it is a missed opportunity to ex-
hibit unified support for the immediate 
steps to confront Vladimir Putin’s evil 
empire. A much stronger bill has been 
introduced in the Senate that was ne-
gotiated over the weekend by Repub-
licans and Democrats in the House and 
Senate. Why the majority would forgo 
taking yes for an answer and instead 
introduce a much weaker, watered- 
down bill is beyond me. 
Our second bill is an omnibus appro-
priations bill covering the remainder of 
fiscal year 2022. Our third bill is a 
short-term continuing resolution to en-
sure the continuity of government 
funding while Congress finishes the 
larger bill. And our fourth bill is a $15 
billion 
standalone 
COVID 
supple-
mental. 
The omnibus appropriations bill was 
a long time in coming. Indeed, we are 
over 5 months into fiscal year 2022, and 
it is more than a little frustrating that 
it has taken us this long to get here. 
But we are here now, and the bill be-
fore us represents a realistic com-
promise between the House and the 
Senate and between Democrats and Re-
publicans. 
The omnibus bill is far, far better 
than the partisan bills the House 
passed last summer. This bill preserves 
the historic legacy of bipartisan pro- 
life riders like the Hyde amendment 
and the Weldon amendment, both of 
which absolutely had to be in this 
package in order to become law. It 
omits new partisan policy riders on 
which there is no consensus. It in-
creases defense spending by more than 
$25 billion over last year, which is 
clearly necessary in the wake of Vladi-
mir 
Putin’s 
unprovoked 
aggression 
against Ukraine. And it provides for an 
appropriate, measured increase in non-
defense spending, which will allow for 
continued investments in programs 
like the National Institutes of Health, 
ARPA-H, TRIO, and GEAR UP. The 
limited increase in nondefense spend-
ing allows us to make responsible in-
vestments in key programs while being 
good stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
While it spends more than I would 
have preferred, it is still a very reason-
able compromise. 
Before I conclude, Madam Speaker, I 
want to, once again, congratulate 
Chairwoman ROSA DELAURO and Rank-
ing Member KAY GRANGER of the Ap-
propriations Committee on today’s bill 
and thank them for their hard work. 
On the new addition, the $15 billion 
COVID supplemental, I think there are 
serious concerns with this additional 
unpaid-for increase. According to the 
CBO, there is currently more than $340 
billion in unobligated funds available 
for repurposing and appropriation. In-
deed, instead of providing new re-
sources like this bill does, we should 
rescind or repurpose existing COVID 
resources for these purposes, as the bill 
we considered earlier today would have 
done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t have any other requests for time. 
Does the gentleman have any addi-
tional requests for time? 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I have 
more remarks. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to bring up H.R. 6858, 
the American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act, for immediate consid-
eration. 
Over the past few weeks, we have 
seen the clear consequences of Presi-
dent Biden’s war on the oil and gas in-
dustry. Emboldened by Russia’s role as 
the key source of energy for much of 
Europe, Vladimir Putin launched an 
unprovoked invasion of his neighbor, 
Ukraine. Gas prices are soaring, with 
the pressures of unchecked inflation 
and Putin’s threats to cut off oil and 
gas exports pushing them ever higher.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1392 
March 9, 2022 
Indeed, Mr. Putin has begun to deploy 
his most potent weapon, which is to 
threaten to cut off Europe’s energy 
supply right in the dead of winter. 
Madam Speaker, this was all avoid-
able. The United States has the capac-
ity to be energy independent if only we 
choose to be. We can stand on our own 
two feet, confident in the knowledge 
that we can meet all of our domestic 
energy needs right here at home, and 
we can provide assistance to our allies 
to ensure their protection against Rus-
sian threats. 
Unfortunately, President Biden’s ac-
tions since taking office have made 
this impossible. On day one of his Pres-
idency, he terminated the Keystone XL 
pipeline, and he subsequently froze oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands. In 
lieu of the U.S. producing oil and gas 
that we need, he is instead asking 
every other oil producing country but 
the United States to step up. Many of 
these are hardly friends of our country 
or, frankly, humanity. It is simply as-
tonishing. 
The American Energy Independence 
from Russia Act would address this 
challenge and ensure American energy 
self-sufficiency. It would immediately 
approve the Keystone XL pipeline; it 
would restart oil and gas leasing on 
Federal lands and waters; and it would 
expand liquid natural gas exports at 
the moment Europe needs them most. 
It would free the United States and our 
allies to act in opposition to Vladimir 
Putin’s brutal and barbarous assault on 
his neighbor without fear. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ on the previous question and a 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We talked about this earlier. I don’t 
want to belabor the point, but I just 
want to make sure my colleagues un-
derstand there are 9,000 wells that are 
currently unused. Oil companies are 
experiencing record profits, $174 billion 
in profits, while they gouge American 
consumers. 
As for the Keystone pipeline, when 
people say to just turn on the switch, 
there is no switch to turn on. It was 
never completed. By the way, even if it 
was completed, estimates are that 
maybe it would save you a penny on a 
gallon of gas. 
Maybe the time has come for us to 
have a serious conversation about en-
ergy independence that involves an ac-
knowledgment that we need to wean 
ourselves off of fossil fuels. We need to 
actually care about the environment 
and dealing with climate change. And 
we need to tell the oil companies, espe-
cially during this crisis, to work with 
us to help the American people get 
through this difficult time—in fact, 
help the world get through this dif-
ficult time. But there is no excuse for 
price gouging. 
Madam Speaker, I have no other re-
quests for speakers, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I advise 
my friend I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, before I go to my 
formal remarks, my friend and I will 
have a discussion about energy. 
I am a big believer in renewables. My 
own State gets 42 percent of its elec-
tricity from wind power, and we are 
number two in the country. I would put 
our record up against anybody. 
We really do believe in ‘‘all of the 
above.’’ But we are very proud of hav-
ing produced energy for over 100 years 
for this country in abundance, far be-
yond our needs, and exported at rea-
sonable prices. 
I would also remind my friend, what-
ever the prices are—and I wish they 
were lower—they are cheaper here than 
just about anyplace else in the world, 
and we can thank, literally, the thou-
sands of people I am privileged to rep-
resent. 
Many of us represent over 10 million 
of the men and women who actually 
produce the energy this country needs 
and, frankly, the rest of the world 
needs right now. I don’t think they 
ought to be demeaned. I don’t think 
their motives ought to be questioned. 
They are an extraordinary group of 
people, and they are patriotic and step 
forward whenever we need them. When 
times are bad, nobody seems to care 
what happens to them. When times get 
tougher, everybody wants them to step 
forward, invest more, and do more, and 
they do. They will continue to do that 
in this time of crisis. So, I don’t think 
we need to be divided on this. 
There is no question we need more oil 
and gas now; Europe needs more oil 
and gas now; and we have been taught 
a serious lesson about the dangers of 
becoming reliant on people like Mr. 
Putin when they have the ability to 
impact world prices. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, although 
I oppose the rule, I am greatly encour-
aged by the underlying appropriations 
measure. While it is not perfect—no 
bill ever is—and could always be bet-
ter, it does represent a good com-
promise between Democrats and Re-
publicans that will ensure full-year 
funding for fiscal year 2022. 
The bill before us continues Con-
gress’ policy of increasing our invest-
ments in defense spending, which is of 
critical importance at this time of 
global crisis. It provides for needed in-
vestments in health, including increas-
ing 
funding 
for 
combating 
future 
pandemics and research into diseases 
like cancer. It funds education, infra-
structure, energy production, roads, 
and care for our Nation’s veterans. 
b 1815 
It includes also—and I want to thank 
my friend for doing this—his proposal 
for a much-needed White House con-
ference on hunger, and it is an area we 
work together on. I am proud to ac-
knowledge his leadership in that. 
It is, in sum, a bill Congress can col-
lectively be proud of, and it is a bill 
that does the right thing for the Amer-
ican people. 
On the Russia oil ban, I am dis-
appointed. 
The 
Democrats 
walked 
away from a strong bipartisan, bi-
cameral deal that could have united us 
as a Congress and led to swift passage 
in the Senate. As it currently stands, it 
is unclear what fate awaits this legisla-
tion in the Senate. I am hopeful that 
my friends on the other side will re-
flect on this missed opportunity and 
work with Republicans to not only 
stand up against Russian aggression 
abroad but also for homegrown Amer-
ican energy resources that are critical 
to achieving our goals and checking 
Vladimir Putin. 
On the new $15 billion unpaid-for 
COVID supplemental, the data is clear 
that there are already adequate re-
sources available. These could be fully 
utilized before additional funds are 
provided. 
Madam Speaker, while I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, I en-
courage all Members to support the bi-
partisan and bicameral omnibus appro-
priations bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me again thank my friend from 
Oklahoma for his comments and for 
him being so accommodating during 
this day that began really early this 
morning. 
Let me also thank the staff of the 
Rules Committee, Democrats and Re-
publicans, who work incredibly hard. I 
think this entire Congress and the 
American people owe them a debt of 
gratitude. 
I also want to thank Chairwoman 
DELAURO
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER
and the staff, both Demo-
cratic and Republican, of the Appro-
priations Committee for all of the in-
credible work that they have done. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the previous 
question. The gentleman is right that 
American consumers need relief right 
now, and we ought to be having a dis-
cussion on how to help alleviate the 
burden of high energy costs right now. 
The problem with what my Repub-
lican friends are proposing is it pur-
ports to provide relief 20 years or 30 
years down the road. We need to find 
mechanisms right now to help lower 
costs to consumers, and we have to find 
a way to do it so that whatever we do

gets passed on to the consumers and 
not just absorbed by the oil companies, 
as we have seen in the past. 
We also need to get serious about re-
newable energy and about dealing with 
the climate crisis. I mean, we should 
have done it a long time ago. We would 
probably be having a very different 
conversation right now. 
So as we deal with Putin’s price hike, 
let’s understand that, you know, there 
is an immediate issue that what they 
are proposing doesn’t even begin to ad-
dress and there is the long-term issue. 
I would rather have a long-term solu-
tion that is not so reliant on fossil 
fuels. 
What we have in this omnibus bill 
will help this country, will help every-
body, will help every State, will make 
a real difference in people’s lives. It 
will help our kids in school. It will help 
the parents of those kids get good jobs. 
It helps provide additional resources to 
medical research to try to find cures to 
life-threatening diseases like cancer. 
There are so many good things in here. 
There are obviously things that we 
all don’t agree on or see eye to eye on. 
The gentleman mentioned the changes 
that he liked. No surprise that I don’t 
like all of those changes that he liked. 
He doesn’t like some of the things that 
I like. But that is the way this works, 
especially when we have to negotiate 
four corners, which means Democrats 
and Republicans have to work things 
out and you have a Senate that—well, 
I don’t want to go there. Anyway, the 
bottom line is, we ought to get this 
done. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ on 
the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ on the previous 
question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 973 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6858) to strengthen United States energy se-
curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6858. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays

graph (1), submit to the appropriate congres-
sional committees a justification for the 
waiver proposed under such paragraph. 
(B) APPROPRIATE

tion, the term ‘‘joint resolution of dis-

(2) INTRODUCTION
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
REP-
RESENTATIVES.—During a period of 5 legisla-
tive days beginning on the date that a cer-
tification under subsection (b)(1) is sub-
mitted to Congress, a joint resolution of dis-
approval may be introduced in the House of 
Representatives by the majority leader or 
the minority leader. 
(3) INTRODUCTION IN THE SENATE.—During a 
period of 5 days on which the Senate is in 
session beginning on the date that a certifi-
cation under subsection (b)(1) is submitted to 
Congress, a joint resolution of disapproval 
may be introduced in the Senate by the ma-
jority leader (or the majority leader’s des-
ignee) or the minority leader (or the minor-
ity leader’s designee). 
(4) FLOOR CONSIDERATION IN THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES.— 
(A) REPORTING AND DISCHARGE.—If a com-
mittee of the House to which a joint resolu-
tion of disapproval has been referred has not 
reported such joint resolution within 10 leg-
islative days after the date of referral, that 
committee shall be discharged from further 
consideration thereof. 
(B) PROCEEDING TO CONSIDERATION.—Begin-
ning on the third legislative day after each 
committee to which a joint resolution of dis-
approval has been referred reports it to the 
House or has been discharged from further 
consideration thereof, it shall be in order to 
move to proceed to consider the joint resolu-
tion in the House. All points of order against 
the motion are waived. Such a motion shall 
not be in order after the House has disposed 
of a motion to proceed on a joint resolution 
with regard to the same certification. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the motion to its adoption without 
intervening motion. The motion shall not be 
debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote 
by which the motion is disposed of shall not 
be in order. 
(C) CONSIDERATION.—The joint resolution 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order 
against 
the 
joint 
resolution 
and 
against its consideration are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the joint resolution to final passage 
without intervening motion except two 
hours of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the sponsor of the joint resolution 
(or a designee) and an opponent. A motion to 
reconsider the vote on passage of the joint 
resolution shall not be in order. 
(5) CONSIDERATION IN THE SENATE.— 
(A) COMMITTEE REFERRAL.—A joint resolu-
tion of disapproval introduced in the Senate 
shall be referred to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
(B) REPORTING
AND
DISCHARGE.—If the 
Committee on Finance has not reported such 
joint resolution of disapproval within 10 days 
on which the Senate is in session after the 
date of referral of such joint resolution, that 
committee shall be discharged from further 
consideration of such joint resolution and 
the joint resolution shall be placed on the 
appropriate calendar. 
(C) MOTION TO PROCEED.—Notwithstanding 
Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate, it is in order at any time after the Com-
mittee on Finance reports the joint resolu-
tion of disapproval to the Senate or has been 
discharged from its consideration (even 
though a previous motion to the same effect 
has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to 
the consideration of the joint resolution, and 
all points of order against the joint resolu-
tion (and against consideration of the joint 
resolution) shall be waived. The motion to 
proceed is not debatable. The motion is not 
subject to a motion to postpone. A motion to 
reconsider the vote by which the motion is 
agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
order. If a motion to proceed to the consider-
ation of the joint resolution of disapproval is 
agreed to, the joint resolution shall remain 
the unfinished business until disposed of. 
(D) DEBATE.—Debate on the joint resolu-
tion of disapproval, and on all debatable mo-
tions and appeals in connection therewith, 
shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, 
which shall be divided equally between the 
majority and minority leaders or their des-
ignees. A motion to further limit debate is in 
order and not debatable. An amendment to, 
or a motion to postpone, or a motion to pro-
ceed to the consideration of other business, 
or a motion to recommit the joint resolution 
of disapproval is not in order. 
(E) VOTE ON PASSAGE.—The vote on passage 
shall occur immediately following the con-
clusion of the debate on the joint resolution 
of disapproval and a single quorum call at 
the conclusion of the debate, if requested in 
accordance with the rules of the Senate. 
(F) RULES OF THE CHAIR ON PROCEDURE.— 
Appeals from the decisions of the Chair re-
lating to the application of the rules of the 
Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure 
relating to the joint resolution of dis-
approval shall be decided without debate. 
(G) CONSIDERATION OF VETO MESSAGES.—De-
bate in the Senate of any veto message with 
respect to the joint resolution of dis-
approval, including all debatable motions 
and appeals in connection with such joint 
resolution, shall be limited to 10 hours, to be 
equally divided between, and controlled by, 
the majority leader and the minority leader 
or their designees. 
(6) PROCEDURES IN THE SENATE.—Except as 
otherwise provided in this subsection, the 
following procedures shall apply in the Sen-
ate to a joint resolution of disapproval to 
which this subsection applies: 
(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), 
a joint resolution of disapproval that has 
passed the House of Representatives shall, 
when received in the Senate, be referred to 
the Committee on Finance for consideration 
in accordance with this subsection. 
(B) If a joint resolution of disapproval to 
which this section applies was introduced in 
the Senate before receipt of a joint resolu-
tion of disapproval that has passed the House 
of Representatives, the joint resolution from 
the House of Representatives shall, when re-
ceived in the Senate, be placed on the cal-
endar. If this subparagraph applies, the pro-
cedures in the Senate with respect to a joint 
resolution of disapproval introduced in the 
Senate that contains the identical matter as 
the joint resolution of disapproval that 
passed the House of Representatives shall be 
the same as if no joint resolution of dis-
approval had been received from the House of 
Representatives, except that the vote on pas-
sage in the Senate shall be on the joint reso-
lution of disapproval that passed the House 
of Representatives. 
(7) RULES
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES
AND
SENATE.—This subsection is en-
acted by Congress— 
(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power 
of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives, respectively, and as such are deemed a

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means or their re-
spective designees. 
The gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) and the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BRADY) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today 
in a moment of great sorrow as the 
Ukrainian people continue to endure 
the brutal and unprovoked assault by 
Russia upon their independence. 
We have all witnessed the heart-
breaking footage of this war’s innocent 
victims. We heard the harrowing sto-
ries of families who have been torn 
apart and forced to leave their country. 
We have watched with admiration as 
the 
Ukrainian 
people 
have 
coura-
geously defended their homeland. 
Madam Speaker, tonight, we are all 
Ukrainians. This unprovoked, unjusti-
fied invasion is a horrific stain on hu-
manity. This evening, we here in this 
Congress will firmly condemn Putin’s 
aggression with the legislation that is 
before us. Inaction is not an option. 
I am very pleased, once again, that 
the Committee on Ways and Means, in 
a bipartisan manner, has led the devel-
opment of this package that will take 
decisive action to exact economic pain 
on Putin and his regime. 
The Russian regime relies on energy 
sales to fund many of its offenses. This 
bill will cut off some of the revenue 
with a ban on the import of Russian oil 
and energy products into the United 
States. The more economic pain we in-
flict on Putin, the more pressure he 
will feel to finally end this brutal cam-
paign of terror on the Ukrainian peo-
ple. I don’t think tonight the people of 
Ukraine think that Vladimir Putin is a 
genius. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation also 
takes steps to review Russia’s partici-
pation in the World Trade Organiza-
tion. This is an international organiza-
tion comprised of 150 nations. Member-
ship is a privilege that comes with re-
sponsibilities, and bad actors who de-
stabilize global security should not 
enjoy the economic benefits of belong-
ing to that body. 
Madam Speaker, I am committed to 
providing and punishing Russia at the 
WTO as we proceed. Broad bipartisan 
support exists in this Congress for 
these meaningful actions to hold Putin 
accountable and full support for the 
Ukrainian people. With this legisla-
tion, we reaffirm our commitment to 
peace and to democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge our col-
leagues to support this consequential 
moment and act accordingly, and I 
look forward to its swift passage into 
law. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, while missiles and 
machine guns rain down death on inno-
cent Ukrainians, President Zelensky is 
pleading with America and all free na-
tions to stop buying Russian oil to fund 
this inhumane war. 
This weekend, America should know 
that both parties in Congress came to-
gether, worked together in agreement 
to immediately ban purchases of Rus-
sian energy. I was proud to have helped 
lead that bipartisan effort of the House 
Committee on Ways and Means and 
Senate Committee on Finance, and 
pleased that President Biden, who 
fought the Russian energy ban tooth 
and nail, finally relented and accepted 
the moral choice to stand with the peo-
ple of Ukraine. 
The bill before us is certainly not as 
strong an energy ban as what Congress 
crafted, nor does it include Congress’ 
crucial economic sanctions to revoke 
favorable trade relations with Russia 
and Belarus, which would have tar-
geted all the products America buys 
from Russia. But President Biden in-
sisted that these economic sanctions be 
dropped so that nearly half of all Rus-
sian imports to the U.S. will go un-
touched. For some reason, he is insist-
ing we treat Russia, the invader, the 
same as Ukraine, the invaded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1397 
March 9, 2022 
b 1930 
It’s puzzling why Russian diamonds 
and vodka deserve continued special 
treatment here in America. Those reve-
nues all help strengthen Russia’s econ-
omy to fund the war against Ukraine. 
President Biden insisted, regrettably, 
in this bill they remain protected. Our 
allies will certainly get a laugh. 
This bill directs our trade representa-
tive to urge other nations to revoke 
the special trading status for Russia, 
even though America refuses to do it at 
this time. That is not a profile in cour-
age. 
I wish our President was as com-
mitted to crippling economic sanctions 
as neighboring Canada, which banned 
both Russian oil and revoked the spe-
cial trading treatment for Russian 
products. To be clear, neither the 
President’s executive ban nor this bill 
takes any action to replace Russian oil 
with Made-in-America energy. 
Nothing in this bill includes Repub-
lican-led proposals to extend secondary 
sanctions on Russian energy purchases 
in financing around the world—as we 
already impose on Iran and North 
Korea. Nothing in this bill creates ac-
cess to more American-made energy on 
and offshore. Nor does it approve 
American pipelines that could easily 
replace Russian oil with U.S. and Cana-
dian energy, or accelerate approval for 
delayed permits for American export 
facilities to help the rest of the world 
wean themselves from the grip of dirty 
Russian energy. 
Answer this question: Why is our 
country begging Venezuela and Iran, 
terrorist nations and thug regimes, to 
produce more dirty oil to send to 
America when America is fully capable 
of producing all the cleanest oil and 
gas in the world that we need right 
here at home? 
As expected, the President is blaming 
everyone 
and 
everything 
for 
high 
prices and inflation—including the war. 
Higher prices, as you know, have ham-
mered Americans for a solid year, all 
starting with the President’s $2 trillion 
unpaid-for COVID stimulus that ig-
nited inflation, paid people not to 
work, and fueled the worst inflation in 
40 years. 
Thanks to the White House, America 
is in a dangerous wage-price spiral, and 
as a result of the President’s failed eco-
nomic leadership more and more ex-
perts are predicting a recession this 
year. No wonder most Americans be-
lieve our economy is already in a reces-
sion or depression and have lost faith 
in the President’s ability to rebuild our 
economy. 
To close, I will tell you this. The ban 
on Russian oil alone is worth our sup-
port. Ukraine is waiting, as Chairman 
NEAL points out. After this bill, I urge 
Congress to do more: to revoke Rus-
sia’s special trade status and unleash 
America’s own ability to be energy 
independent, to replace Russian oil 
with American sources, and use our en-
ergy strength to wean the world from 
Russian energy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to reassure the gentleman that I 
remain committed to the position he 
has offered as it relates to the World 
Trade Organization and a suspension of 
Russia’s partnership in WTO. Making 
sure that we do that in the right proce-
dure I think is the challenge before us, 
but I agree with the point that the gen-
tleman has made. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOG-
GETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, in 
the face of death and destruction, 
President Zelensky and the Ukrainians 
are showing the world the true mean-
ing of courage. 
While the most immediate need is for 
additional 
military 
equipment, 
we 
could respond tonight by taking an-
other step to isolate Russia from the 
world economy and ensure that Ameri-
cans are no longer contributing the 
revenue to fund his war machine. To 
take the energy out of Putin’s brutal 
assault, we place energy on our sanc-
tions list. It may cost more to fill your 
tank, but we must work to stop Putin’s 
tanks from crushing families and free-
dom. 
Our legislation also calls for expel-
ling Russia from the World Trade Orga-
nization. Russia should not be per-
mitted to benefit from the world order 
and stability that it is destroying with 
each bomb dropped and each Ukrainian 
murdered. The financial pain we are 
imposing cannot ease the pain of 
Ukrainian families, but it is one way 
for us to demonstrate our solidarity 
with them. 
Putin and his apologists here in 
America and abroad must know that 
those who support democracy and com-
bat aggression are united like never be-
fore. As the flow of Ukrainian dead and 
wounded grows, so must the economy 
of Russia shrink. 
This bill is both more and less than 
the original version which Representa-
tive BLUMENAUER and I introduced the 
week before last in immediate response 
to Russian aggression. It now omits the 
most-favored nation treatment provi-
sion. 
Throughout Putin’s initial saber rat-
tling and subsequent bomb dropping, 
the administration has wisely rejected 
the go-it-alone approach that lead 
America to disaster under previous ad-
ministrations. 
The 
President 
has 
united our allies and is determined to 
keep them united. I believe as he con-
tinues to work with our allies we will 
be able to move forward, as Canada 
has, as our original bill proposed, and 
eliminate this most-favored nation sta-
tus for Russia. 
I am very pleased that the bill adds 
to what we had initially, the extension 
and 
revitalization 
of 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky Act. This has done a tre-
mendous job in reducing human rights 
abuses, and with its inclusion in this 
bill we reauthorize it remaining united 
against aggression. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), the Republican 
leader of the Trade Subcommittee. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 
6968, the Suspending Energy Imports 
from Russia Act. 
This bill Democrats have brought to 
the floor, although important, is not 
what it actually could be. It is actually 
a missed opportunity to address our 
trade relationships with Russia and 
Belarus, and it is a missed opportunity 
to bolster domestic American-produced 
energy in a serious fashion so that we 
can address energy prices here at 
home. 
Every Member of this body knows 
that we could and should be voting on 
the stronger bipartisan product that 
leaders on the Ways and Means and 
Senate Finance Committees agreed to 
merely days ago. It was bipartisan and 
bicameral. It revoked permanent nor-
mal trade relations for Russia and nor-
mal trade relationships for Belarus. 
It also included an energy import ban 
and instead of loopholes, provided an 
off-ramp should Russia reverse course 
in Ukraine and earn back our trust. 
The text we have before us today is ob-
viously not that bill. 
The President demanded a lesser 
path and the House Democrats have 
chosen to support him in that effort. 
However, I do know that doing nothing 
is not an option. 
I will support this bill, and I urge my 
Democratic colleagues to join Repub-
licans in our push to use the trade 
tools at our disposal to address Vladi-
mir Putin’s unacceptable tyrannical 
aggression against Ukraine. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of the underlying bill, 
but I want to acknowledge the com-
ments from my colleagues about the 
bipartisan approach that we originally 
advanced. It is, I think, unfortunate 
that we are not stripping away the 
most–favored trade status from the 
Russians. I am convinced that we will 
be able to get there with the expression 
that we have had on both sides of the 
aisle. I think it is important that we 
can remain committed to advancing 
this in terms of tightening the eco-
nomic noose around Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a little dis-
appointed with the rhetoric that we 
have heard attacking the administra-
tion for not coming forth with fanciful 
efforts to increase domestic produc-
tion. As has been documented on the 
floor repeatedly in the course of this 
debate, there are ample leases that are 
unused now, some 9,000 such leases. 
Everything that my friends on the 
other side of the aisle are talking 
about is not going to produce one addi-
tional gallon of oil next year or two 
years afterwards. These are longer– 
term issues that relate to the mechan-
ics of production, the economics of the 
industry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1398 
March 9, 2022 
Where our salvation is going to rise 
is taking advantage of the elements 
that the Democrats have advanced in 
terms of clean energy production. This 
is reliable, sustainable, and not subject 
to the whims of international global 
petrochemical arguments and disputes. 
In the meantime, I strongly urge sup-
port of the legislation and renew my 
commitment to work on a bipartisan 
basis to be able to strip away the most- 
favored nation status, working to-
gether to accomplish this in as expedi-
tious a fashion as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the co-
operation of the chairman of the com-
mittee being able to move and take ad-
vantage of the expressions of my 
friends on the other side of the aisle. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, un-
fortunately President Biden continues 
to be inexcusably feckless in his re-
sponse to global threats from our ad-
versaries. 
Now, in the moment of truth, when 
America can send a clear and unequivo-
cal message to dictators and democ-
racies alike by banning Russian oil im-
ports to the United States, the Presi-
dent has failed once again to rise to the 
occasion. 
This anemic response would remove 
the commonsense conditions for lifting 
the ban like Russia’s full and imme-
diate withdrawal from Ukraine and 
their ceasing to threaten other NATO 
countries. 
The most egregious aspect of this 
proposal is that the President and the 
Democrat leadership refused to revoke 
Russia’s permanent normal trade rela-
tion status, which will continue to 
allow them low-tariff access to the 
United States market—a privilege only 
allies of freedom should receive. 
Consistent with Biden’s timid re-
sponse, I fear that these half-measures 
will not only fail to deter Vladimir 
Putin, but will invite other tyrants 
around the world to follow suit. 
Mr. Speaker, we must unload the full 
arsenal, the full force of America’s eco-
nomic arsenal on the Russian Federa-
tion and their rogue leader. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of this bill to isolate 
and stop sending our money to Russia. 
Russia’s 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine has already caused countless 
deaths and injuries while forcing 1.5 
million innocent refugees to flee their 
homes. There must be consequences for 
this belligerence. 
That is why I support cutting off 
Russia’s oil and gas imports to the 
U.S., seeking to suspend their partici-
pation in the World Trade Organiza-
tion, and extending our ability to im-
plement 
further 
sanctions. 
Global 
trade, the wealth it helps generate and 
the needs it helps to meet, is a benefit 
of the very international order that 
Russia is trying to undermine. 
If Putin is declaring war on global 
peace and stability, then he should also 
not be able to benefit from global peace 
and stability. 
I believe that the promise of being 
able to once again profit from global 
trade is a powerful incentive for Putin 
to end his war of choice. I am proud to 
support using our economic influence 
for peace. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. FERGUSON), the chief deputy whip 
for the Republican Conference. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, the 
war on American energy independence 
began on day one of President Biden’s 
administration. 
That 
war 
has 
hit 
Americans hard in the pocketbook, and 
the cost at the pump, and for every-
thing else they buy has gone up as a re-
sult of this administration’s policies. 
All too often we look across the globe 
and see the cost of those policies, and 
we see that in Ukraine right now. 
Every single barrel of Russian oil that 
we buy has at least a quarter of 
Ukrainian blood in it. It is time to put 
an end to it. 
Now we have a bill that has been 
much watered-down, it doesn’t have 
the teeth in it that it should because 
this administration does not seem will-
ing to stand up to this dictator. Now 
that we are having a discussion about 
ending a relationship with one dic-
tator, it seems that the administration 
is willing to trade one for three, buying 
oil from Venezuela, Iran, and now 
Saudi Arabia. 
This war on pricing has got to come 
to an end. The war on American energy 
independence has to come to an end. It 
is time for this administration to open 
up American energy independence. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 6968, suspending energy imports in 
response to Russia’s barbaric, inhu-
mane, and unprovoked attacks on 
Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. 
These imports include crude oil, petro-
leum, coal, coal products, natural gas, 
and other products. 
On March 8, President Biden issued 
an executive order to prohibit energy 
imports from Russia, which I totally 
agree with. Mr. Speaker, I support and 
urge passive of H.R. 6968. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. RICE), the Republican 
leader of the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. BRADY, Mr. NEAL, 
and Mr. DOGGETT for their leadership 
on this bill to sanction Russian energy 
exports, which I support, but I must ex-
press my frustration that this bill does 
not go far enough. 
b 1945 
On February 7, President Biden stat-
ed that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the 
United States would impose crippling 
sanctions. Yet, here we are, 2 weeks 
after Biden finally found the courage 
to call it an invasion, and the sanc-
tions are still being rolled out piece-
meal. 
Only last week, the administration 
was telling us that sanctioning Russian 
oil and gas imports was not on the 
table. In the face of inaction, Demo-
crats and Republicans in Congress 
came together to impose the crippling 
sanctions the President had promised 
but not followed through on. The bipar-
tisan bill would have banned Russian 
oil imports and enabled the imposition 
of tariffs on all remaining Russian im-
ports to America. But the White House 
intervened, and my Democrat friends 
withdrew their support. 
Instead, this bill bans only oil. The 
remaining half of Russian trade re-
mains. American purchases will keep 
funding Russia’s cruel invasion, and 
Russia will keep its most-favored-na-
tion status in the World Trade Organi-
zation. 
In this bill, we ask our allies to pe-
nalize Russian imports, but we refuse 
to do so ourselves. Now, that is not 
leadership. I cannot understand why 
America would maintain trade rela-
tions with a nation that only last night 
bombed 
a 
children’s 
hospital 
in 
Mariupol, Ukraine. 
Mr. President, how many more inno-
cent Ukrainians need to die before you 
do what you promised? Stop projecting 
weakness, and just do what you say. 
China is watching. The world is 
watching. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HIMES). Members are reminded to di-
rect their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port tonight’s bills because we must 
fund the government, and of course, we 
must support Ukraine. 
As the American people get out of 
COVID, get back to work, and get on 
with our lives, they are yearning to 
help Ukrainian lives. Tonight’s bills do 
that by providing aid and armaments 
so that the Ukrainians can continue to 
punch Putin right in the face. 
This bill, H.R. 6968, also punches 
Putin right in the gut by banning im-
ports of Russian oil, by taking steps to 
remove Russia from the WTO, and by 
holding Putin accountable for his vio-
lating of rights with tougher sanctions. 
The last thing we want is war with 
Russia. However, in order to stop 
Putin’s paranoid adventurism, we need 
to bolster our commitment to NATO, 
and we must bleed him of his resources 
to wage war by crumpling his ruble and 
collapsing his economy. This will af-
fect us, and it will force all of us to 
play our part. 
But despite these costs, we must con-
tinue to be as united as we are inspired 
by this fledgling democracy that has 
flourished under fire. That is why we 
must play our part and pass this legis-
lation to support the livelihoods of

Americans, to support the lives of 
Ukrainians, and to ensure that Putin 
pays his price for his attacks on a 
peaceful democracy. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. SMUCKER), who is a mem-
ber of the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start my 
comments by saying that I really do 
believe that there is no daylight be-
tween our parties on our commitment 
to cripple Putin’s ability to wage war 
in Ukraine. We stand with the people of 
Ukraine, Democrats and Republicans 
alike. 
I want to thank Chairman NEAL and 
Ranking Member BRADY for putting to-
gether a strong bill to stop financing 
Putin’s aggression. This was a bill that 
was bipartisan and bicameral that 
would have stopped providing financial 
support to Russia and put an end to im-
porting Russian oil. Unfortunately, 
that bill that they worked so hard on is 
not the bill that we are debating here 
tonight. 
Now, I plan to vote in support of this 
bill because I believe it is important 
that we stand with Ukraine. But I want 
to make it clear to the White House 
and to Democratic leadership: You 
know that we could have done better, 
yet for some reason, the White House 
intervened, and I don’t understand. 
I would like someone to answer the 
question: Why are we running a prod-
uct that replaced another product that 
would have put an end to favored-trade 
status for Russia and Belarus? Why are 
we voting on a product that will not be 
taken up by the Senate? 
We had a better deal. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
legislation banning Russian oil and gas 
imports and imposing additional sanc-
tions to punish Putin and his cronies 
for their war of aggression in Ukraine, 
which has caused more than 2 million 
Ukrainians to flee their country. 
President Biden has already imposed 
swift and severe consequences, includ-
ing yesterday’s executive action. How-
ever, it is the duty of Congress to join 
the President, enact a congressional 
ban on Russian oil and gas imports to 
the U.S., and send a strong message to 
the Kremlin that none of our money 
will be used to bankroll shelling of 
Ukrainian families. 
Yesterday, the Oversight and Reform 
Committee held a bipartisan briefing 
with U.S. and Ukrainian Government 
officials. 
The 
message 
was 
clear: 
Putin’s regime must be denied these 
crucial oil revenues while we continue 
to provide urgently needed aid to 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation for the good of the United 
States and the support of Ukraine. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄4 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today is day 14 of Putin’s 
ruthless, senseless war on Ukraine. 
Yet, with all eyes on the United States, 
President Biden has still failed to im-
pose the necessary full economic pen-
alties on the Russian economy. 
This week, Ways and Means Repub-
licans and Democrats negotiated a 
strong bipartisan bill that added addi-
tional, much-needed economic punish-
ments on Putin’s war effort, a historic 
deal that stopped both U.S. imports of 
Russian oil and suspended normal 
trade relations with Belarus and Rus-
sia—that is, before the White House 
got involved. 
To be clear, the only reason the 
White House is doing anything is be-
cause it is being politically expedient. 
They stopped and stalled negotiations. 
The White House has subsequently 
watered down negotiations where now 
40 percent of nonenergy imports from 
Russia can still continue under this 
plan, fueling his war efforts. 
While banning U.S. imports of Rus-
sian oil is critical, this weakened legis-
lation fails to go the distance and truly 
hold Putin accountable for his shame-
ful war crimes. 
There is a special place in hell for 
evil despots who bomb children’s hos-
pitals. We must do everything at our 
disposal to support Ukraine and prove 
to the world that a strong America will 
not allow brutal dictators to reign on 
this Earth without swift and ferocious 
consequences. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), who represents 50,000 
Ukrainian Americans. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman 
NEAL
and 
Congressman 
LLOYD DOGGETT for allowing me this 
time tonight to rise in strong support 
of liberty by suspending energy im-
ports from Russia to help crush Putin 
for his crimes against humanity. 
Putin is murdering innocent men, 
pregnant women, children, and the el-
derly. He is bombing them into pieces. 
The brutal savagery unleashed by 
Putin and allowed by his treacherous 
oligarchs requires crushing and un-
flinching retribution. 
The time has come to terminate the 
flow of Russia’s blood-soaked oil into 
our land. We must also suspend Russia 
from the World Trade Organization. 
And let us sanction Putin and his 
enablers as far into the pits of hell as 
we possibly can. 
As the gold standard for freedom and 
democracy, the world is watching 
America right now. This is not the 
time for holdouts or cowards. Every 
Member of this body must rise up with-
out delay and lead by example. 
Pass this legislation. Hit Putin and 
his enablers where it hurts. The just 
cause of liberty demands nothing less. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH), who is a longtime 
leader on human rights. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, Russian oil and gas is abso-
lutely financing Putin’s horrific war of 
aggression. I am for this bill, but there 
are provisions in this one in particular 
that should not be in here. 
Mr. Speaker, I am the prime sponsor 
of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act which we added to 
the 2017 NDAA. 
Under the act, an actionable offense 
occurs only when there is a gross viola-
tion 
of 
internationally 
recognized 
human rights which has the meaning 
given to it in the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961. 
Specifically, the Foreign Assistance 
Act includes torture or cruel, inhuman, 
or degrading treatment or punishment, 
prolonged detention without charges 
and trial, causing the disappearance of 
persons by the abduction and clandes-
tine detention of those persons, and 
other flagrant denial of the right to 
life, liberty, or the security of person. 
H.R. 6968, however, radically strikes 
and replaces the current definition of 
what constitutes an actionable offense 
with language that is not defined—and 
this being done tonight without the 
benefit of hearings or due diligence. 
Under the new language, the Presi-
dent may impose sanctions on an indi-
vidual if responsible for or complicit in 
or has directly or indirectly engaged in 
what they call serious human rights 
abuse. 
Exactly what does that mean? 
There is no definition. 
How is that phrase defined? 
How elastic is it, especially when it 
is not linked to any international trea-
ty or covenant? 
What does directly engaged mean? 
How indirect? 
Guilt by association? 
The Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act got it right. It was 
bipartisan, and it links sanctions to 
internationally 
recognized 
human 
rights. 
I hope the Senate will take a look at 
this. This is an egregious mistake. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, Putin’s de-
cision to bring this horrific tragedy 
upon the people of Ukraine is rightly 
to be condemned, and it is right at this 
moment in history that we do not fund 
this aggression by proxy through the 
purchase and importing of Russian oil. 
But it is also tragic that the Biden 
administration and Democrats in this 
Chamber would rather turn to dictato-
rial, terrorist-sponsoring regimes to 
fill the energy gap rather than the 
world-renowned work ethic and innova-
tion of the American people. 
This administration should be doing 
everything it can to ramp up produc-
tion and increase energy exports. Back 
home in Texas, we know that one of

the best ways this can be achieved is 
by investing in our ports, like the Port 
of Corpus Christi in my district. 
Increasing U.S. energy exports can 
provide relief and hope for the Ukrain-
ian people. It can give Europe the as-
surance it needs to break away from 
Russian energy. And it can provide re-
lief and economic opportunity for 
American families. 
It is past time to stop Biden’s assault 
on American energy and restore Amer-
ica’s energy dominance. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I share concerns that others have 
raised on the process of our getting 
here, but I rise today in favor of ban-
ning Russian energy imports. And I 
urge the Biden administration to work 
on an all-of-the-above domestic energy 
strategy. 
While I am glad that we are stopping 
the flow of U.S. capital to the Kremlin, 
I am concerned that prices will rise 
without a plan to support domestic en-
ergy production. Our national security 
will also continue to be at risk as the 
administration looks to countries like 
Iran and Venezuela to fuel our commu-
nities. 
The more we rely on authoritarian 
regimes, the more we hurt our econ-
omy, national security, and environ-
ment. 
Energy security is national security. 
We need responsible energy solutions 
to expand domestic energy supply 
chains and lower costs for consumers. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, the Sus-
pending Energy Imports from Russia 
Act has a great name, but the bill 
doesn’t live up to its name. 
Let me just read a little from the 
text because it is the text that mat-
ters. 
On page 2, ‘‘Prohibition of Energy 
Products’’: This bill bans nothing until 
45 
days 
after 
enactment. 
Ukraine 
doesn’t have 45 days. 
Under section 2(a)(2), titled ‘‘Author-
ity to Allow Importation Under Con-
tract’’: Why are we even having this 
section when the idea was to ban Rus-
sian oil, not to allow importation? 
It states: ‘‘The President may allow 
certain products . . . to be imported 
into the United States . . . pursuant to 
a written contract . . . that was en-
tered into before the date of enactment 
of this act.’’ 
So the bold statement from para-
graph 1, that all oil products from the 
Russian Federation shall be banned 
from importation, just got eviscerated 
and shot full of holes. It is leakier than 
a sieve because every barrel of oil com-
ing into the United States is covered 
under a contract, so every barrel is ex-
empted for the length of the contract. 
No business makes millions of dollars 
of purchases without a contract. This 
bill is smoke and mirrors intent on de-
ceiving the American people that the 
Democrat majority and the Biden ad-
ministration are doing something bold 
when, in reality, it is a false start and 
a penalty on the field. 
b 2000 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Putin 
thought he could divide us because our 
last President served Russian interests 
so very well—fawning over Putin, unre-
lenting criticism of our allies, under-
mining NATO, preferring Putin’s word 
over American patriots, repeatedly pit-
ting one American against another. 
Recently, as Putin amassed tanks on 
the Ukrainian border, President Biden 
was not the one who hailed Putin’s ac-
tion as ‘‘genius.’’ 
As 
Putin 
ordered 
troops 
into 
Ukraine, it wasn’t President Biden who 
called Putin’s terror a ‘‘peacekeeping 
mission’’ and who then called Putin 
‘‘very savvy.’’ 
Last Friday, as Russian bombs were 
killing hundreds of Ukrainians, it was 
not Biden’s trusted adviser who said 
Putin had been ‘‘too gentle’’ and called 
President Zelensky ‘‘a puppet’’ and 
blamed him for failing to appease 
Putin 
by 
declaring 
a 
‘‘neutral 
Ukraine.’’ 
As Biden has tried to unite, Trump 
and his cronies cannot stop licking 
Putin’s boots, even as Putin was using 
those boots to kick Ukrainians in the 
teeth. Sadly, many of those who come 
to criticize our President and his ef-
forts to bring us together have been 
sadly and totally mute, unable to voice 
a word of disapproval of those who 
would divide us, Putin’s apologist-in- 
chief here in America. 
Let’s unite and stand with Ukrainian 
patriots and approve this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I will just 
point out, all of that was nonsense. The 
truth of the matter is, it was Democrat 
President Clinton who forced Ukraine 
to turn over 1,800 nuclear weapons to 
Russia and President Obama who stood 
by when Putin took over parts of 
Ukraine. Now, under President Biden, 
we stand by while he looks to invade 
and take over a sovereign nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Mr. 
GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, it is very interesting where 
we find ourselves right now. Just a few 
years ago—in fact, within the last 
year—we have advocated for banning 
Russian oil. We have advocated for it. 
Guess who has opposed it, on the 
record, voting against banning Russian 
oil? It is a really interesting place 
where we find ourselves where, all of a 
sudden, things have turned and folks 
have realized, oh, my goodness, we 
have got to change our position, we 
have got to flip-flop, and we now have 
to ban Russian oil. 
Mr. Speaker, look at the policies of 
this administration. Look at the poli-
cies of my friends on the other side of 
the aisle. We have seen record high 
prices, we have seen record increases in 
greenhouse gas emissions, and we have 
seen record energy insecurity as a re-
sult of these policies. 
We have letters from Democrat Mem-
bers of Congress to the administration 
begging them to work with OPEC Plus 
nations to increase their oil and gas 
production. We have had a more than 
doubling of our importation of crude 
oil from Russia under this administra-
tion. 
The administration’s failed policies 
have limited us to what they will tell 
you are two options and only two op-
tions. We can either buy Russian oil 
and fund the aggression of Putin into 
Ukraine, or we can pay higher prices in 
the United States. 
This bill fails to address the under-
lying problem and actually provide a 
solution. 
Mr. Speaker, you have seen these ad-
ministration officials. Who are they 
talking to right now to backfill their 
production from Russia? Who are they 
talking to? They are talking to Ven-
ezuela. They are talking to Iran. They 
are talking to the Saudis. We are going 
to find ourselves right back in this sit-
uation. 
The good news is, we have a solution 
for you. We can actually do what the 
President said in this very Chamber 
last week. We can buy American. We 
can buy American energy. Let’s buy 
American energy, not Saudi, not Ven-
ezuela, not Russian. Let’s buy Amer-
ican energy, because we have 38 billion 
barrels of oil we can produce here and 
trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. 
We can do it safer here. We can do it 
cleaner here. That is what the motion 
to recommit allows. It allows us to un-
leash American energy opportunities, 
to unleash jobs in America, to unleash 
opportunities for Americans to go back 
to work and unleash the economic ac-
tivity associated with it. 
We can export liquefied natural gas 
from America to our allies in Europe 
and not have them 40 percent depend-
ent upon energy from Russia, from 
Vladimir Putin continuing to this day 
to 
fund 
his 
activities 
attacking 
Ukraine and causing human rights vio-
lations all over that country. 
I want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, it 
was President Biden that lifted the 
sanctions that effectively facilitated 
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and it was 
President Biden who more than dou-
bled the importation of crude oil from 
Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
motion to recommit. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
This evening’s debate is about hold-
ing 
Putin 
accountable 
for 
his 
unprovoked attack on the Ukrainian 
people. What we are talking about here 
is responsible use of trade policy as a 
powerful tool not only to condemn

Putin’s aggression and pursue peace 
but to act. 
I hope in this moment, when we are 
in such a dire state, we would not use 
the opportunity just for partisan argu-
ment but try to focus very hard on the 
real task at hand, which is holding 
Putin accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time, 
I will offer a motion to recommit this 
bill to the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
I will also ask to have my amend-
ment, that suspends permanent normal 
trade relations with Russia, included in 
the RECORD. 
While there is broad agreement to 
stop imports of Russian energy, to 
stand with Ukraine, Congress does need 
to do more. That is what this motion 
does. 
As we talked earlier, when we talked 
about amending the rule to offer Amer-
ican-made energy production, the idea 
of doing sanctions without American 
energy production is incomplete at 
best. 
But when it comes to trade with Rus-
sia, we also need to take stronger 
steps, stronger bipartisan steps. We 
had a good, bipartisan agreement that 
stopped oil imports from Russia but 
also removed preferential trade on 
other products from Russia. 
The bill we are voting on today al-
lows about 40 percent of the total prod-
ucts we buy from Russia to receive 
preferential trade treatment. That is 
why we are so disappointed and puzzled 
about why this provision was removed 
from the bill, because I believe that 
there is sincerely broad, strong bipar-
tisan support in Congress to remove 
and suspend that. 
I know that Chairman NEAL is com-
mitted to working together toward 
that goal. By not revoking PNTR, Rus-
sia enjoys the same preferential trade 
status and lower tariffs as all of our 
American allies. 
Ironically, unless we change the bill, 
Russia will maintain the same trade 
status on nonenergy products, like 
Russian 
diamonds 
and 
vodka, 
as 
Ukraine, the country they invaded. 
That is not right by any measure. We 
need to be tougher together. 
Congress can lead by passing this mo-
tion to recommit, which simply sub-
stitutes the bipartisan agreement we 
reached that both shuts down Russian 
oil imports and removes the pref-
erential trade status for all of the 
other products we import from Russia. 
America needs to lead, Congress 
needs to lead, to take this important 
bipartisan step and vote ‘‘yes’’ on the 
motion to recommit. 
I strongly believe the effort in this 
bill to immediately stop purchases 
from Russia has support and should 
have support from every American, but 
we need to do more. 
I urge my colleagues and I urge our 
President to stand with us with strong 
economic sanctions and more Amer-
ican-made energy to replace Russian 
oil. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, our trade policy is a 
powerful tool, and this evening we will 
have an opportunity not only to con-
demn Putin’s aggression, but just as 
importantly, to act upon it. 
This legislation to ban the import of 
Russian energy products and evaluate 
Russia’s access to the WTO will help to 
hold this brutal dictator accountable. 
We can and will do more. 
I will continue to explore, as Mr. 
BRADY noted, how we can utilize the 
full jurisdiction of the committee to 
stand up to Putin and to protect the 
Ukrainian people. 
Let me, however, take a moment to 
congratulate Joe Biden for the manner 
in which he has assembled a multilat-
eral alliance across the globe to con-
demn and to combat this dictator. 
When you consider that not only have 
our traditional allies in NATO—which 
was condemned at one time—we now 
can understand why it has been so en-
during. 
Just as importantly, beyond Western 
Europe and NATO, the Swiss, the 
Finns, the Swedes, the Japanese, the 
Kenyans, like most of the rest of the 
civilized world, have stood with us in 
this moment of challenge. Tonight, let 
us all stand with the Ukrainian people 
and support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 6968 which will 
cut off oil and other energy imports from Rus-
sia which provide key support to Putin’s war 
machine. 
This bill stands in solidarity with the proud 
Ukrainian people fighting for their homeland 
and builds on President Bidens executive ac-
tions to ban Russian energy imports. 
The crippling sanctions the Biden Adminis-
tration has coordinated with our allies have 
isolated Russia to an unprecedented degree: 
are weakening Russia’s ability to fund their il-
legal military offensive. 
I believe that we can and should do even 
more. Although our European allies have 
moved quickly to support punishing sanctions 
against Russia and its corrupt leaders, other 
countries are providing aid and comfort by ac-
tually stepping up trade with Russia. 
As we look to ratchet up the pressure on 
Russia to force them to stop the needless 
bloodshed, we need to ensure that every 
country is doing their part to help end this war 
and hold Russia accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of 
this bill, I urge my colleagues to vote yes to 
send a strong unified message that we are 
committed to doing everything we can to fight 
Russian aggression, stand with the Ukrainian 
people, and provide the military assist Ukraine 
desperately needs to defend itself. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 6968, the 
‘‘Suspending Energy Imports From Russia 
Act.’’ 
I support this legislation because it dem-
onstrates the commitment of the United States 
in assembling and leading an international co-
alition of the world’s leading nations to ensure 
that all nations refuse to recognize the illegal 
invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation 
and to ensure that the Russian Federation is 
held accountable and sustain maximum eco-
nomic damage from the imposition of sanc-
tions as a consequence of its utter disregard 
for international law and norms. 
Specifically, H.R. 6968 bans the importation 
into the United States of Russian crude oil and 
certain petroleum products, liquefied natural 
gas, and coal. 
Last year, the U.S. imported nearly 700,000 
barrels per day of crude oil and refined petro-
leum products from Russia so this step will 
deprive Russia of billions of dollars in reve-
nues from U.S. drivers and consumers annu-
ally. 
The bill also bans new U.S. investment in 
Russia’s energy sector, which will ensure that 
American companies and American investors 
are not underwriting Vladimir Putin’s efforts to 
expand energy production inside Russia. 
Finally, the bill bans Americans from financ-
ing or enabling foreign companies that are 
making investment to produce energy in Rus-
sia. 
The Russian ruble is now worth less than a 
penny and has hit an all-time low after losing 
almost half of its value since Putin announced 
his further invasion of Ukraine. 
By isolating Russia’s Central Bank and cut-
ting off the largest Russian banks from the 
international financial system, Russia has 
been disarmed his war chest of foreign re-
serves and left Putin to soften the blow of our 
sanctions. 
U.S. and allied export controls are impacting 
industrial production in Russia, Russian com-
mercial aviation, and other key sectors of the 
Russian economy. 
The United States and governments all over 
the world are going after Putin’s cronies and 
their families by identifying and freezing the 
assets they hold in our respective jurisdic-
tions—their yachts, luxury apartments, money, 
and other ill-gotten gains. 
The United States strongly supports efforts 
to assist Ukraine to defend its territory against 
military aggression by the Russian Federation 
and by separatist and paramilitary forces. 
Ukraine was the second-most populous and 
powerful of the fifteen republics of the former 
and disintegrated Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
publics and the hub of the union’s agricultural 
production, defense industries, and military ar-
senal. 
In the three decades since gaining its inde-
pendence, Ukraine has sought to forge its own 
path as a sovereign state and sought closer 
economic, social, and political ties with the 
free market and democratic nations of the 
West. 
Since 2013, the Russian Federation has un-
dertaken a campaign of political, economic, 
and military aggression against Ukraine, in-
cluding the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines 
Flight 17, a civilian airliner, by Russian-backed 
Ukrainian separatists using a Russian-made 
missile taking the lives of all 298 innocent per-
sons on board. 
In February 2014, the military of the Russia 
Federation, without merit or cause, invaded

March 9, 2022 
the eastern part of the free and independent 
country of Ukraine, including the Crimean Pe-
ninsula, and backed a separatist insurgency in 
the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine, where 
fighting has killed over 14,000 people. 
The United States, a strategic ally of 
Ukraine, reacted swiftly to the Russian inva-
sion, condemning the military action in strong 
and bipartisan fashion, and providing military, 
humanitarian, and non-military financial assist-
ance to the determined but beleaguered na-
tion of Ukraine, which since 2014 has totaled 
approximately $1.5 billion. 
On September 14, 2014, the House of Rep-
resentatives adopted H. Res. 726, a resolution 
supporting the right of the people of Ukraine to 
freely determine their future, including their 
country’s relationship with other nations and 
international 
organizations, 
without 
inter-
ference, intimidation, or coercion by other 
countries, and committed itself to solidarity 
with the people of Ukraine. 
Interference and unprovoked aggressions by 
the Russia Federation ordered and led by 
Vladimir Putin continued unabated, including 
the mobilization and stationing of 150,000 
Russian troops surrounding Ukraine and 
armed forces positioned in Belarus to attack 
Ukraine from the north, including war planes 
and offensive missile systems, and the move-
ment of Russian naval vessels in the Black 
Sea to Ukraine’s south, including amphibious 
assault ships, missile cruisers, and sub-
marines, and the positioning of blood and 
medical equipment into position on their bor-
der. 
Vladimir Putin sought authorization from the 
Russian parliament to use military force out-
side of Russian territory by staging a fraudu-
lent on-camera meeting of his Security Council 
to grandstand for the Russian public and by 
recognizing sovereign Ukrainian territory as 
so-called independent republics in clear viola-
tion, again, of international law, all of which 
was intended to set the stage for further pre-
texts and further provocations by Russia Fed-
eration to make further aggressions against 
Ukraine by military action. 
Vladimir Putin rejected every good-faith ef-
fort the United States and its allies and part-
ners made to address mutual security con-
cerns through dialogue to avoid needless con-
flict and avert human suffering. 
On February 23, 2022, the Russia Federa-
tion military, at the direction of Vladimir Putin, 
began a premeditated brutal assault on the 
people of Ukraine without provocation, without 
justification, without necessity, making out-
landish, false, and baseless claims that 
Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war 
against Russia and that Ukraine was prepared 
to use chemical weapons, and that Ukraine 
had committed a genocide. 
These actions were taken by Vladimir Putin 
at the very moment that the United Nations 
Security Council was meeting to stand up for 
Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, 
culminating in missile strikes on historic cities 
across Ukraine, followed by air raids and the 
invasion of Russian tanks and troops. 
Mr. Speaker, through this legislation the 
United States strongly condemns and opposes 
the unprovoked invasion and egregious act of 
aggression against sovereign state of Ukraine 
by the Russian Federation, the most provoca-
tive and destabilizing act of foreign aggression 
since the 1938 invasion of the Sudetenland by 
the Third Reich led by Adolph Hitler. 
This legislation visits the costs of the 
unprovoked aggression and invasion ordered 
by Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian head of the 
Russian Federation against the sovereign na-
tion of Ukraine on the Russian economy. 
The United States is strongly committed to 
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
integrity of Ukraine. 
I ask all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 6968 to support the right of the people of 
Ukraine to freely determine their future, includ-
ing their country’s relationship with other na-
tions and international organizations, without 
interference, intimidation, or coercion by other 
countries. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 973, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Brady moves to recommit the bill, 
H.R. 6968, to the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BRADY is as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be known as the ‘‘Sus-
pending Normal Trade Relations with Russia 
and Belarus Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and 
is committed to ensuring that the WTO re-
mains an effective forum for peaceful eco-
nomic engagement. 
(2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that 
is entitled to enter into agreements with 
other sovereign states and to full respect of 
its territorial integrity. 
(3) The United States will be unwavering in 
its support for a secure, democratic, and sov-
ereign Ukraine, free to choose its own lead-
ers and future. 
(4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh 
Agreement Establishing the World Trade Or-
ganization (WTO Agreement) and has been a 
WTO member since 2008. 
(5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO 
Agreement creates both rights and obliga-
tions vis-a`-vis other WTO members. 
(6) The Russian Federation acceded to the 
WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th 
WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus 
has applied to accede to the WTO. 
(7) From the date of its accession, the Rus-
sian Federation committed to apply fully all 
provisions of the WTO. 
(8) The United States Congress authorized 
permanent normal trade relations for the 
Russian Federation through the Russia and 
Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei 
Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act 
of 2012 (Public Law 112–208). 
(9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO 
General Council on March 2, 2022, urging 
that all WTO members take action against 
the Russian Federation and ‘‘consider fur-
ther steps with the view to suspending the 
Russian Federation’s participation in the 
WTO for its violation of the purpose and 
principles of this Organization’’. 
(10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, 
has led the Russian Federation into a war of 
aggression against Ukraine, which— 
(A) denies Ukraine and its people their col-
lective rights to independence, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity; 
(B) constitutes an emergency in inter-
national relations, because it is a situation 
of armed conflict that threatens the peace 
and security of all countries, including the 
United States; and 
(C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to 
participate in international organizations, 
including the WTO. 
(11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a 
ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is 
providing important material support to the 
Russian Federation’s aggression. 
(12) The Russian Federation’s exportation 
of goods in the energy sector is central to its 
ability to wage its war of aggression on 
Ukraine. 
(13) The United States, along with its allies 
and partners, has responded to recent aggres-
sion by the Russian Federation in Ukraine 
by imposing sweeping financial sanctions 
and stringent export controls. 
(14) The United States cannot allow the 
consequences of the Russian Federation’s ac-
tions to go unaddressed, and must lead fel-
low countries, in all fora, including the WTO, 
to impose appropriate consequences for the 
Russian Federation’s aggression.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Ms. DeLauro of Connecticut moves that 
the House concur in the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 2471 with an amendment consisting 
of the text of Rules Committee Print 117–35 
modified by the amendment printed in House 
Report 117–269. 
(For text of the House amendment to 
the Senate amendment, see Book II of 
this RECORD.) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 973, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude 
extraneous 
material 
on 
the 
House 
amendment 
to 
the 
Senate 
amendment to H.R. 2471. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of our 
2022 government funding legislation. 
This package makes historic invest-
ments in the middle class and people 
who are living paycheck to paycheck. 
They deserve a government that, in-
stead of catering to the wealthy and 
big corporations, bends over backwards 
to support them. By providing a 6.7 
percent increase for nondefense fund-
ing, the largest increase in 4 years, 
that is exactly what we are doing. 
What a marker we have put down. 
That is translated into funding for ag-
riculture, increased by 6 percent; en-
ergy and water, increased by 6.6 per-
cent; 5.7 percent increase for financial 
services and general government; 5.2 
percent increase for interior and envi-
ronment; a 7.5 percent increase for 
transportation and housing; 11.8 per-
cent increase for legislative branch, 
which includes support for the Capitol 
Police who put their lives on the line 
defending this body; and a 7.5 percent 
increase for labor, health, and human 
services, and education to support 
Americans at every stage of their lives. 
That is what this bill represents after 
years of stalled investment in each 
area. 
With the funding included in this 
package, we are helping working fami-
lies with the cost of living; we are help-
ing students pay for the high cost of 
education; we are giving hardworking 
families a better chance to own their 
own homes; and we are connecting 
rural communities to the internet so 
that they can reach their full poten-
tial. 
We are putting Americans back to 
work by creating jobs here in America, 
helping small businesses, supporting 
job training, rebuilding our infrastruc-
ture, including unlocking the full fund-
ing provided by the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act. 
We are supporting the vulnerable by 
feeding the hungry and the food inse-
cure 
through 
nutrition 
assistance, 
making housing more affordable, and 
addressing gender-based violence. 
And we are tackling our toughest 
challenges. We are confronting climate 
change through environmental enforce-
ment. 
We 
are 
supporting 
environ-
mental justice with $100 million, an $83 
million increase over last year. We are 
making historic investments in clean 
energy and climate science. 
By rebuilding our public health infra-
structure, investing in lifesaving bio-
medical research, with $3.2 billion, an 
increase of $104 million, for HIV/AIDS 
research, 
and 
confronting 
urgent 
health 
crises, 
we 
are 
making 
healthcare more affordable for more 
Americans. 
And we are going to ensure that big 
corporations and the wealthy pay their 
fair share to support these investments 
by increasing funding for the IRS to 
$12.6 billion. 
Think about the leaders that we 
hoped to emulate as we entered public 
life, all of us, leaders like Frances Per-
kins, the first woman to serve as the 
U.S. Secretary of Labor and one of the 
principal architects of the New Deal. 
She once said, ‘‘I came to Washington 
to work for God, FDR and the millions 
of 
forgotten, 
plain 
common 
workingmen,’’ and I add women. 
She, as well as my parents, told me 
to battle for working people, never to 
take no for an answer. They said work 
for the everyday citizen. 
With this government funding legis-
lation, we are here tonight as well to 
stand in solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine. As the world watches in hor-
ror, civilians—including children, the 
ill, expectant mothers—are being tar-
geted by Russia’s unprovoked and ut-
terly inhumane attacks. 
We are becoming witness to one of 
the worst humanitarian crises we have 
seen in generations, which is why this 
bill provides $13.6 billion in humani-
tarian assistance, defense support, and 
economic aid to help the Ukrainian 
people in their most desperate hour of 
need. 
We care for our servicemembers and 
our veterans by providing $224 million 
for the military’s child development 
centers; strengthening the VA with 
$598 million for suicide prevention out-
reach of veterans; and $840 million for 
gender-specific care and programmatic 
efforts for women. 
At the Labor, Health, and Human 
Services and Education, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee, which I am 
honored to chair, we go even further to 
expand 
access 
to 
education, 
Head 
Start, childcare, lifesaving biomedical 
research, 
public 
health, 
maternal 
health, mental health, job training, 
and worker protection; and we support 
workers and support the skills they 
need to succeed. 
We deliver for our students by pro-
viding the largest increase to Pell 
grants since the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009. By in-
vesting $14.5 billion for special edu-
cation programs, $75 million for full- 
service community schools, $17.5 bil-
lion to support low-income students, 
we are giving millions of students a 
chance to access higher education and 
unlock a lifetime of opportunity. 
We make healthcare more affordable 
and accessible; $8.5 billion for the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion. We bolster the public health in-
frastructure. 
We 
confront 
pressing 
health crises with $1 billion for mater-
nal and child health, $2 billion for men-
tal health, and $3.9 billion for sub-
stance use treatment.

March 9, 2022 
Finally, we are strengthening life-
saving 
biomedical 
research, 
accel-
erating the pace of scientific break-
throughs with $6.9 billion for the Na-
tional Cancer Institute, $1 billion to es-
tablish 
the 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects Agency for Health, ARPA-H. 
Together we are accelerating the pace 
of scientific breakthroughs for diseases 
such as ALS, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, 
and cancer. 
I must, however, express my dis-
appointment that the Hyde amendment 
remains in this bill. I am the first Ap-
propriations chair since 1977 to remove 
it, because I understand that this is an 
offensive and discriminatory policy 
which has shut out countless women 
from the reproductive healthcare that 
they deserve for more than 40 years. 
While Republicans blocked our efforts, 
I will never stop fighting to ensure 
equal treatment for women. 
The ten bills in this package include 
community projects funding, which 
meets the urgent needs in districts 
across the country and sends a clear 
message to the American people that 
Congress is working for them. 
I conclude with this comment from 
Frances Perkins, who said in her fare-
well address: 
There is always a large horizon, and it is 
up to us to contribute some small part to a 
program of human betterment for all time. 
I believe that through this govern-
ment funding package, we are proving 
that that horizon is not only large, but 
it is endless. 
There is no limit to what we can 
achieve, and for the first time in a long 
time I believe we show just how gov-
ernment can work for working people 
once again and to achieve the better-
ment of humankind. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members’ sup-
port for this transformative invest-
ment in working families and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2471, a bill that will provide 
funding for the Federal Government 
through the end of this fiscal year. 
While it has taken us far too long to 
get here, I am glad we were able to 
produce a bill that includes many fund-
ing priorities that I support. 
Since last summer, I have made it 
clear that House Republicans would op-
pose Appropriations bills unless they 
increase 
defense 
spending, 
restrain 
nondefense spending, include all long-
standing policy provisions, and do not 
include any poison pill riders. 
After months of negotiations, we 
reached a deal that meets all four of 
these criteria. The bill before us in-
creases defense spending by roughly 6 
percent, which is $4.5 billion above the 
NDAA; rejects the President’s proposed 
16 
percent 
increase 
in 
nondefense 
spending; includes the Hyde amend-
ment and other critical pro-life poli-
cies; and drops other controversial lan-
guage. 
For defense, the bill provides our 
military and our troops with the re-
sources they desperately need. The 
roughly $42 billion increase in defense 
spending across all the appropriations 
bills will improve military readiness, 
start key modernization initiatives, 
and support our brave warfighters and 
their families so they can improve 
their quality of life. 
The package also contains an addi-
tional $1 billion for Israel’s Iron Dome 
to allow Israel to replace the intercep-
tors that were used in the most recent 
conflict. 
The bill also ensures the safety and 
security of the American people by in-
creasing overall funding for Homeland 
Security by 11 percent, including in-
creases for Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement and Customs and Border 
Protection. 
New funding is also included to in-
crease staff for the Border Patrol, 
which would address the crisis at our 
southwest border. 
Because 
of 
this 
bill, 
President 
Trump’s successful remain in Mexico 
program will continue, and President 
Biden’s plan to cancel existing border 
wall funding will be rejected. 
I am proud to say that this bill not 
only funds the police, it increases re-
sources for law enforcement agencies 
to address the troubling nationwide in-
crease in crime. 
Also before us today is crucial assist-
ance to help the Ukrainian people, the 
Ukrainian Government respond to Rus-
sia’s invasion. I know we all share the 
feeling of shock and grief as we witness 
Russia’s attack on the sovereign na-
tion of Ukraine and its aggression 
across innocent people. 
To close, I want to thank my col-
leagues, Chairwoman DELAURO, Sen-
ator SHELBY, Senator LEAHY, and the 
subcommittee 
chairs 
and 
ranking 
members for their work on this bill. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting the items in this bill that en-
hance our national security, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), the chair of the Appro-
priations Subcommittee on Energy and 
Water. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, please let 
me thank Chair DELAURO for her perse-
vering leadership on this critical bill, 
and I would like to thank Ranking 
Member SIMPSON
for his productive 
partnership, as well as the Energy and 
Water Subcommittee staff and major-
ity clerk, Jaime Shimek, for their 
work. 
The Energy and Water division of 
this bill is a historic investment in 
American jobs, innovation, and com-
petitiveness. It engages and advances 
all 
energy 
technologies 
to 
assure 
America’s energy independence in per-
petuity and for our security while sus-
taining life on Earth. 
Our bill delivers for the American 
people by investing $8.3 billion in the 
Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild 
America’s water infrastructure and 
prepare for increasing rainfall, rising 
sea levels, and desertification; 
$1.92 billion in the Bureau of Rec-
lamation for the West’s water manage-
ment; 
$44.9 billion in the Department of En-
ergy, including $3.2 billion for energy 
efficiency and renewable energy pro-
grams to spur good-paying jobs and 
lower costs for the middle class. 
Importantly, 
our 
bill 
responsibly 
funds our nuclear deterrent and en-
hances nonproliferation efforts. 
In sum, the energy and water divi-
sion builds forward for America’s crit-
ical goals. Our bill invests in the hard-
working men and women who make, 
build, and grow America. Now more 
than ever, our bill is needed to unleash 
American progress in this new century. 
Finally, as chair of the Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I want to highlight 
the Congress’ swift and essential sup-
port for Ukraine. On a bipartisan basis, 
it is this House, as Article 1 of the Con-
stitution, that has always led on pro-
viding aid to Ukraine. The $13.6 billion 
in emergency funding includes vital re-
sources for Ukraine and her brave peo-
ple to meet their urgent economic and 
humanitarian needs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure unanimously. 
b 2030 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS), the former chair-
man of the Committee on Appropria-
tions and the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
the introduction. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to salute Chair-
man DELAURO and Ranking Member 
GRANGER of the full committee for put-
ting together a final appropriations 
package for the year. It is a fair com-
promise that includes funding for many 
priorities here at home and abroad. 
As ranking member of the Sub-
committee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs, I want 
to highlight a few priorities included in 
the SFOPS section of the bill that pro-
vide critical funding to our allies and 
partners during a time of great angst 
around the globe. 
Although essential military and eco-
nomic aid for the brave people of 
Ukraine is included elsewhere in the 
bill as an emergency supplemental ap-
propriation, base funding for State- 
Foreign Operations is essential to our 
national security. 
Following the chaotic Afghan with-
drawal by this administration, and a 
full-scale assault on Ukraine by Presi-
dent Putin, it is critically important 
that this Congress sends a signal to the 
rest of the world that the United 
States stands by its allies and part-
ners. 
We do so here by including $3.3 bil-
lion in Foreign Military Financing for 
Israel and robust, continued support 
for other key partners in the Middle 
East like Egypt and Jordan. Funding is

also 
increased 
for 
our 
efforts 
to 
counter the malign influence of the 
Chinese Government. 
In our own hemisphere, the bill in-
creases funding for one of our most im-
portant partners in the region, Colom-
bia, as they continue to work to thwart 
drug producers and traffickers. The bill 
also prioritizes funding to address the 
flow of fentanyl and other synthetic 
opioids into the United States from 
Mexico and China. 
I am also pleased to report that the 
agreement restores all protections for 
the unborn that are in current law, in-
cluding a prohibition on the use of 
funds to pay for abortion. At no time 
should U.S. taxpayer dollars be used to 
kill the unborn. We must always pro-
tect the sanctity of life. 
Finally, this omnibus provides crit-
ical resources for southern and eastern 
Kentucky, I am proud to say. It con-
tinues our fight against the opioid epi-
demic, which is as important now as it 
has ever been. 
It provides record funding for my 
Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revi-
talization Program, which is creating 
new economic opportunities across Ap-
palachia and throughout my district. 
It includes my community project 
funding requests, which will provide 
important resources to our first re-
sponders, help protect Kentuckians 
from future floods, improve access to 
clean water, fight the scourge of 
opioids, improve medical care, and pro-
mote economic growth. 
This bill is a substantial improve-
ment on the House-passed bill, and I 
commend our chairwoman and ranking 
member for their hard work on this 
package. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the chair of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Defense. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2022. 
As chair of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Defense, I want to thank 
Ranking Member CALVERT for his part-
nership and Chair DELAURO and Rank-
ing Member GRANGER for their leader-
ship. 
For fiscal year 2022, the Defense bill 
provides a total of $728.5 billion. That 
is $32.5 billion above the 2021 level. The 
House bill that I wrote was a much 
lower number, but this is the number I 
was instructed to mark up to. 
We prioritized critical investments 
and our most important national secu-
rity asset, our servicemen and -women 
and their families. 
Here are a few examples: a 2.7 percent 
pay raise for over 2 million uniformed 
servicemembers and 750,000 DOD civil-
ian employees; an additional $167 mil-
lion so all DOD personnel can earn at 
least a $15 minimum wage; an addi-
tional $397 million for basic housing 
and subsistence allowances so that our 
servicemembers can feed their children 
properly; $97 million to enact the Inde-
pendent Review Commission on Sexual 
Assault in the Military; $37 billion for 
Defense Health and medical research 
programs, including $577 million for 
cancer research; historic levels of DOD 
investments in clean energy, climate 
adaptation, and facility resiliency; a 
$486 million increase of environmental 
restoration activities, including $210 
million for PFOS/PFOA cleanup; and 
an additional $686 million to respond to 
the Red Hill fuel spill in Hawaii. 
This bill confronts Vladimir Putin’s 
illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine 
by providing robust funding for the 
Ukraine 
Security 
Initiative 
and 
NATO’s partners and allies. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue. 
It is time for Congress to do our work 
to pass this omnibus bill and fund our 
government. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON), 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of the fiscal year 2022 
omnibus appropriations bill and par-
ticularly the Energy and Water Devel-
opment and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act. 
As ranking member of the sub-
committee, I say to my colleagues: It 
is a strong bill and deserves bipartisan 
support. 
There are, of course, things I would 
have done differently had I been the 
only one writing the bill. I am sure my 
chairwoman would be able to say the 
same thing. But that is the nature of 
bipartisan negotiations. Everyone has 
to give a little in order to get what 
each needs most. 
First and foremost, this bill strongly 
supports our national nuclear security 
programs, providing $20.7 billion, which 
is an increase of almost $1 billion above 
fiscal year 2021 and above the Biden ad-
ministration’s budget request. This 
funding supports the maintenance and 
modernization of our nuclear weapons 
complex and supports the Navy’s nu-
clear propulsion program. 
Harbor maintenance trust fund ac-
tivities at the Corps of Engineers are 
funded at more than $2 billion, in ac-
cordance with the Water Resources De-
velopment Act of 2020. 
Efforts to guard our energy sector 
against 
cyberattacks 
are 
increased 
above last year and even above both 
House and Senate bills. 
The bill continues investments in a 
wide array of energy sources, including 
fossil energy, hydropower, energy stor-
age, and—one of my highest prior-
ities—nuclear energy. The bill provides 
$1.65 billion for nuclear energy, includ-
ing increased funding for the advanced 
small modular reactors program; con-
tinued support for the Advanced Reac-
tor Demonstration Program; and initi-
ation of a new program to ensure a do-
mestic supply of high-assay, low-en-
riched uranium that will be necessary 
for many of the advanced reactor de-
signs currently under development. 
Before I yield back, I would like to 
note the hard work of our full com-
mittee leadership, my ranking mem-
ber, KAY GRANGER, as well as Chair 
DELAURO. 
Energy and Water Development, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee Chair-
woman KAPTUR
and I again worked 
well together with our Senate partners, 
Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator KEN-
NEDY. 
Finally, I would like to thank the 
staff on both sides of the aisle for their 
hard work to help bring this bill to 
completion: on the majority staff, 
Jaime Shimek, Scott McKee, Brian 
Smith, Michael Brain, Will Ostertag, 
and Lauren Leuck; on the Republican 
side, Angie Giancarlo; and for my per-
sonal office, Sarah Cannon. 
Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2022 en-
ergy and water bill is a good bill, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the 
chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this 
far-reaching spending bill that lowers 
costs, creates jobs, and rethreads our 
safety net. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies, I am very 
proud of our funding for veterans, serv-
icemembers, and their families. 
We steer $14.9 billion to critical base 
infrastructure to add new barracks and 
childcare centers and rid military fam-
ily housing of mold and lead. It also in-
vests in climate change and energy re-
silience on bases, devoting $150 million 
to PFAS contamination cleanup. 
It provides more to NATO and the 
European Deterrence Initiative, devot-
ing $631 million to confront Russian ag-
gression. 
For Veterans Affairs, it provides $112 
billion to tackle disability claim back-
logs, boost medical research, fully fund 
veteran medical care, and make major 
investments in women’s health and 
mental health and suicide and home-
lessness prevention. 
I thank Ranking Member CARTER and 
Ranking Member GRANGER
for our 
close work together on this good bill, 
and I thank both the majority and mi-
nority staff. 
I am very proud of what this bill de-
livers to Florida, like investing $2 mil-
lion into the Virginia Graeme Baker 
pool and spa safety grant program to 
curb drownings. 
We also add a record $350 million to 
restore the Everglades, the lifeblood of 
south Florida. This is on top of the $1.1 
billion President Biden just allocated 
to our River of Grass in the bipartisan 
infrastructure law.

Florida cities win, too, because we 
unleash infrastructure funds and pro-
vide local government formula funding 
and fund local community projects for 
the first time in more than a decade. 
For Dania Beach, that is $3 million to 
rebuild the C.W. Thomas Park Commu-
nity Center. In Sunrise, it is $2 million 
for flood protection. 
There is tons more, from increased 
breast cancer screenings and reauthor-
izing the Violence Against Women Act 
to provide lifesaving funds to curb do-
mestic violence and sexual assaults. 
We even create a cancer screening pro-
gram for disadvantaged communities 
that honors our departed dear friend, 
ALCEE HASTINGS. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill helps every 
American every day. I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN), the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Homeland Security. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for his hard 
work on this arduous project, this om-
nibus bill. I also want to extend my 
thanks to my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, Chair DELAURO and 
Chair ROYBAL-ALLARD, for their hard 
work. 
We disagree with many of the things 
that the majority has put forth in this, 
but we in the minority have gotten a 
lot of key wins for the American people 
in this bill. 
Coming over, Mr. Speaker, tonight 
on a cold, damp Washington evening, I 
was thinking about what I would say. 
This is a job well done. 
I rise in support of this bill. This is 
not the bill that I would have written. 
This is certainly not the bill that the 
majority would have written. 
Within this beltway, within this 
town, we have a dialect. We have a 
Washington-speak 
sometimes 
that 
should and does befuddle the American 
people. So, tonight is time for straight 
talk. Straight talk means that the 
needs of our Nation, the needs of the 
United States of America, change on 
an annual basis. The world doesn’t stay 
the same. 
A few weeks ago, the world changed 
for the worse when Russia invaded the 
sovereign nation of Ukraine. Things 
change. 
Priorities change. Funding 
needs change. 
That is why, as appropriators, we 
come together every year and, ideally, 
address the Nation’s changing needs— 
whether in defense; education; Depart-
ment of Energy; and, in my case, home-
land security—to address the needs of 
the American people. 
Now, this is an omnibus bill, ‘‘omni’’ 
from the Greek meaning ‘‘all,’’ not 
‘‘cromni’’ meaning ‘‘some,’’ but ‘‘all.’’ 
Now, think about that. In one of the 
most partisan-charged times in Amer-
ican history, Republicans and Demo-
crats, Senators and Members of the 
House, and the White House can come 
together and forge an agreement that 
gets all 12 bills done. 
To the American people watching, 
this is an accomplishment. It is not 
perfect. Of course, it is not. 
Now, the priorities that I champion 
in this bill, $1.9 billion to build the 
wall—very important. I know the ma-
jority doesn’t like that. We got that in. 
The Iron Dome, I stood in this Cham-
ber a few months ago, and I bellowed at 
the majority for stripping that out. I 
was very upset that day, and I knew a 
lot of people in the majority wanted 
Iron Dome in there like all the Repub-
licans did as well. We got that in this 
bill. Our beloved ally, Israel, will now 
be able to defend itself with the Iron 
Dome. 
Our great United States Coast Guard 
will be getting more ships and more 
funding in the homeland bill. ICE beds 
will be funded. 
There are a lot of key priorities. Yes, 
I respectfully and strongly disagreed 
with Chair DELAURO
when she was 
talking about her opposition to the 
Hyde amendment, and she has a right 
to her opinion. That is what is great 
about this Chamber. 
But we have the Hyde protections in 
this bill to protect the unborn. That is 
law in America, and that will remain 
law in America, those Hyde protections 
to make sure that the right to life, 
that sacred right to life—that abor-
tions are never paid for by the Amer-
ican taxpayer. 
b 2045 
So it was a compromise. There were 
some things in this bill, obviously, that 
I don’t particularly care for, but key 
missions through the Department of 
Energy in my beloved city of Oak 
Ridge—my goodness, when we vote for 
this, please know that in the Depart-
ment of Energy, the NNSA, the Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administra-
tion that is in the Department of En-
ergy, funds to keep our Nation’s nu-
clear arsenal safe and secure, the fund-
ing is there for the uranium processing 
facility, $600 million. 
So this is a compromise bill. There is 
no question about that. But think 
about this, my friends in the majority 
and in the minority, to all of the staff 
who worked tirelessly to get this bill 
done, this is not easy work because of 
the bona fide differences that exist be-
tween the parties. 
We have gotten it done for the Amer-
ican people. No, it is not perfect. But, 
yes, it is good. It is going to help the 
people of Ukraine. It is going to help 
our country move forward. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), the chair-
man 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee 
on 
Commerce 
Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in support of this omnibus bill, 
in particular, the Commerce-Justice- 
Science title of the bill. 
In commerce it makes smart invest-
ments that create good-paying Amer-
ican jobs with economic growth. It sup-
ports American manufacturing. 
In justice, it makes funding increases 
for the police, creating better cir-
cumstances for public safety, for fight-
ing crime, reducing gang and gun vio-
lence and in hate crime prevention. 
And in science, it provides robust 
support for things Americans are proud 
of like NASA, the National Science 
Foundation, climate science research. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the staff for a 
lot of hard work on this bill. I thank 
Ranking Member ADERHOLT for work-
ing with me, and I urge support for this 
package. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CALVERT), the ranking 
member of the Defense Subcommittee. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in strong support of this 
omnibus appropriations package. As 
the ranking member of the Defense Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, I will out-
line why America’s position in the 
world depends on the passage of this bi-
partisan bill. 
But first I want to thank Chair 
DELAURO for her hard work and Rank-
ing Member GRANGER for putting this 
together. I thank my partner and 
friend, Chair BETTY MCCOLLUM, for the 
hard work that she has put into this 
bill to make it a reality, and certainly 
the staff on both sides who have been 
working day and night to put this to-
gether and certainly my clerk, Johnny 
Kaberlie, who has done a yeoman’s job 
of getting this done. 
Over the past several weeks, we have 
witnessed Russia invade a sovereign 
nation, indiscriminately killing civil-
ians to the horror of the world. As a 
matter of fact, just a few hours ago a 
maternity ward was bombed by Russia, 
killing new mothers and babies just a 
few hours ago. And while this happens, 
President Xi, Kim Jong Un, and other 
autocrats are watching closely to see 
how the United States will respond. 
I firmly believe that today we are 
closer to a large-scale conflict with a 
near-peer adversary than we have been 
in recent memory. We must get this 
bill to the President’s desk as soon as 
possible to respond to these acts of ag-
gression. Weakness is provocative, and 
a 
year-long 
continuing 
resolution 
would undoubtedly demonstrate weak-
ness on a global stage. 
Included in the defense portion of 
this bill are many priorities for Mem-
bers of both parties that will strength-
en our military. These include 13 new 
Navy ships, increased investment in 
next-generation 
capability, 
like 
hypersonics, full funding for our nu-
clear modernization, and investments 
in our servicemembers and their fami-
lies. 
And as ranking member, I fought 
hard to make sure this bill gets the 
DOD what it needs. We began hearings 
for the fiscal year 2022 saying that the 
Mattis national defense strategy is the 
correct strategy, that we need a 3 to 5

percent net real growth above inflation 
for fiscal years 2022 to 2025. Although 
nobody anticipated inflation at the lev-
els we have seen, I am proud to say the 
Republicans secured a 6 percent fund-
ing increase over last year’s funding 
level. 
I am also proud to say that we 
worked closely with the Armed Serv-
ices and Intelligence Committees to 
make sure all the priorities across na-
tional security were addressed. 
Thanks to the bipartisan commit-
ment of Chairwoman BETTY
MCCOL-
LUM, House Republicans were able to 
secure over 2,000 Member funding prior-
ities on our side of the aisle like addi-
tional Strykers, C–130Js, F–35 mod-
ernization, and critical programs. I 
thank Chair MCCOLLUM for her staff 
and her hard work on this package. 
Failing to pass this piece of legisla-
tion will only further extend the dev-
astating effects of our military readi-
ness, modernization, and lethality that 
we have witnessed over the last 6 
months. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, as the 
world watches, we must send the mes-
sage that this Congress stands ready to 
strengthen its military, to stand by its 
allies, and continue to make the world 
a safer and more prosperous place. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I would like to engage in a colloquy 
with Chair DELAURO
regarding the 
Strategic Long-Range Cannon. 
I ask my friend from Connecticut, is 
it the intent of the committee that a 
portion of the funds provided under the 
Technology Maturation Initiatives line 
be used to invest in the development of 
the SLRC program, should the program 
supply a spend plan? 
Ms. DELAURO. Will the gentlewoman 
yield? 
Ms. SHERRILL. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
The agreement permits the Army to 
use 2022 funds for the Strategic Long- 
Range Cannons so long as it produces a 
comprehensive funding plan and a de-
tailed schedule of activities. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank Ranking Member GRANGER, 
our Senate partners, Chairman LEAHY, 
Vice Chairman SHELBY, our cardinals, 
and all of our Members. I salute the 
staff on both sides of the aisle. I won’t 
mention all their names in the interest 
of time, but these are the most unbe-
lievably professional individuals I have 
ever met. They do the job every single 
day and night and they are up all 
night. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairwoman 
DELAURO, 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER, and all of the Members of the Ap-
propriations Committee for their hard work to 
bring this bipartisan legislation together. 
I want to highlight several important inclu-
sions in this package that are noteworthy and 
that reflect our Majority’s commitment to gov-
erning responsibly For the People. 
First, this legislation includes a robust, 
emergency aid package to help the Ukrainian 
people and their military fight back against 
Vladimir Putin’s criminal invasion, defend their 
freedom and their democracy, and address 
the humanitarian crisis resulting from this 
unprovoked 
attack 
while 
strengthening 
NATO’s deterrence and defense. 
Second, this package will provide strong 
funding for the essential safety-net programs 
that enable Americans to make better lives for 
themselves and their families and keep mil-
lions of Americans from falling into poverty. 
I am particularly pleased that a number of 
key priorities for which I have been advocating 
were included in this package. 
Among them is a 21 percent increase in of-
fice budgets to make allowance for competi-
tive pay for our staff here on Capitol Hill. This 
will enable us to recruit and retain the best 
and brightest to help us serve the American 
people and better reflect our nation’s diversity. 
I am also glad that this bill funds the Depart-
ment of Education’s Full-Service, Community 
Schools program at $75 million. 
We were able to come together as well to 
reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, 
which the House passed last year. 
Additionally, this omnibus includes $95 mil-
lion for the Election Assistance Commission 
(EAC) and election grants to help states im-
prove their voting systems. 
Last summer, I offered—and the House 
adopted—a Floor amendment to the House’s 
Financial Services and General Government 
title directing the EAC to set aside $4 million 
for the purpose of administering the program 
that encourages college students to volunteer 
as poll workers in their communities—a pro-
gram created under my Help America Vote 
Act legislation in 2002. As this bill heads to 
the President’s desk, it is my expectation that 
the EAC will allocate this funding to that pro-
gram as directed. 
I also want to thank appropriators for includ-
ing language to direct the GSA to move for-
ward expeditiously with the selection of a site 
for a new consolidated FBI headquarters at 
one of the three locations previously identified 
in Maryland or Virginia. This project has now 
been ongoing for fourteen years and needs to 
be concluded, and the decision to move for-
ward needs to be made within six months. 
This omnibus reauthorizes our intelligence 
programs as well, and it funds the replenish-
ment and enhancement of Israel’s Iron Dome 
missile defense system. Furthermore, it in-
cludes Rep. BRAD SCHNEIDER’s legislation di-
recting the State Department to continue ex-
panding and deepening the Abraham Accords 
and promoting the normalization of relations 
between Arab states and Israel. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Members as 
well for their efforts to identify and support re-
quests for community project funding, which is 
back this year under strict rules to protect the 
process and ensure that it is ethical, trans-
parent, and accountable. Members know our 
districts better than those working in the exec-
utive branch, which is why this facet of the ap-
propriations process, derived from Congress’s 
constitutional power of the purse, has always 
been very important and beneficial to our com-
munities. 
This is an omnibus that all of us can be 
proud to support. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting for this legislation, and I hope the 
Senate will approve it swiftly as well so that 
President Biden can sign it without delay. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
evening to speak on the FY 2022 appropria-
tions package. I thank Ranking Member 
GRANGER for yielding me the time and for her 
outstanding leadership this year. 
I also want to thank my counterpart, CJS 
Subcommittee Chairman CARTWRIGHT for his 
partnership over the last year. 
Within the CJS title, we’ve been able to in-
crease funding for the Space Launch System, 
the Exploration Upper Stage, and other space 
technologies. All are key in our efforts to es-
tablish a strategic presence on the Moon 
ahead of Russia and China. 
There are increases provided to support our 
communities within agencies such as the DOJ 
and NOAA. We’re investing millions of addi-
tional dollars to improve our ability to under-
stand and forecast extreme weather, so that 
local leaders can help create more resilient 
communities, and Americans can get safely 
out of harm’s way when dangerous weather 
strikes. 
We’re increasing funding for critical drug 
court programs and other vital initiatives that 
address the opioid epidemic, as well as DNA 
analysis programs that are helping to solve 
cold cases. 
Even as we reflect on the spending priorities 
within this package for our own citizens, we 
must not turn our eyes away from the atroc-
ities being committed by Vladimir Putin against 
the people of Ukraine. 
Today, we stand in strong support of the 
people and forces of our ally. Putin’s violent 
attempt to strip Ukrainians of their freedom will 
be met with an even stronger force because of 
our help. 
American strength has long been a deter-
rent of global conflict. I take this responsibility 
seriously and will continue working to ensure 
adequate funding is provided to meet both the 
immediate and long-term security needs of 
this country. 
I encourage my colleagues to support the 
security package within the omnibus appro-
priations bill and ensure the Ukrainians have 
the resources they need to defend themselves 
from these heinous acts. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this bill. As Chairman of the Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies sub-
committee I am pleased to highlight the na-
tional priorities funded in our division which 
impacts the lives of all Americans from heart-
land to coast, farms to cities, and everything 
in between. 
First, our bill makes important, USDA-wide 
investments to ensure equitable participation 
in USDA programs, address the impacts of cli-
mate change, and support staff and leadership 
offices at USDA.

The bill includes over $550 million for the 
expansion of broadband service, including 
$450 million for the Reconnect program. 
Our bill fully funds all the domestic nutrition 
programs and includes a significant invest-
ment to increase the amounts of fruits and 
vegetables offered in the WIC program. Addi-
tionally, there is $2 billion for international food 
aid. 
The bill provides $1.87 billion for farm pro-
grams, including $61 million in loan authority 
to address heirs property issues. 
The bill includes $3.5 billion for agriculture 
research programs, including the Agricultural 
Research Service and the National Institute of 
Food and Agriculture to keep American agri-
culture the best and most bountiful in the 
world. 
The bill includes a total of $3.3 billion for 
FDA and provides targeted increases to en-
sure Americans have access to the safest 
food and medicine. 
This is a good bill and I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
I want to thank our Ranking Member, ANDY 
HARRIS, and the majority and minority com-
mittee staff. 
I also want to thank Chair DELAURO and 
Ranking Member GRANGER for their leadership 
through this process. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, Homeland Security, and the Budget, I rise 
in support of the House Amendment to the 
Senate Amendment to H.R. 2471, the ‘‘Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2022’’ which pro-
vides funding for federal government oper-
ations for the remainder of this fiscal year— 
through September 30, 2022—and prevents a 
wasteful and irresponsible shutdown of the 
federal government. 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act in-
cludes all 12 appropriations bills that fund the 
federal government through the end of Fiscal 
Year 2022, as well as urgently needed supple-
mental appropriations. 
The legislation includes $13.6 billion in 
emergency funding for the courageous people 
of Ukraine, to support their security and hu-
manitarian efforts as they struggle to survive 
and battle against the invading Russian army. 
I am particularly pleased that the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act specifically includes 
$24,435,000 for Community Funding Projects 
in Houston that will directly help my constitu-
ents and enable all Houston-area residents to 
benefit from quality-of-life improvements. 
The provisions of the omnibus spending act 
that resulted from my requests for Community 
Funding Projects include: 
$1,500,000 for the Port of Houston Authority 
to begin a sedimentation study concurrent with 
the deepening and widening of the Houston 
Ship Channel in coordination with the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
$975,000 for the City of Houston Police De-
partment to enable employment of nine (9) 
crime victim advocates via the BYRNE Justice 
Assistance Grants Program who will help the 
department provide a trauma-informed re-
sponse for victims of violent crimes. 
$1,060,000 for the Houston Independent 
School District to construct ‘‘The Vison’’ Com-
munity Statue and Community Project on the 
historic Booker T. Washington High School 
campus. 
$3,000,000 to the City of Houston for two 
revitalization projects of cultural assets: con-
struction of the Bethune Empowerment Center 
and the East End Facility for Latino Arts 
(Talento Bilingue de Houston). 
$9,950,000 to help Harris County prevent 
flooding by providing funds for the Stormwater 
Detention Basin and Culvert Improvement 
project, and its operations. 
$1,950,000 for Jacinto City for Northeast 
Water Mains & Fire Hydrant Improvements, to 
replace aging water and delivery infrastructure 
to a large portion of Jacinto City’s residential 
and business districts. 
$1,000,000 for the Houston Independent 
School District for Project Engagement, an ini-
tiative to provide social and emotional learning 
services to high-needs students, including so-
cial and emotional learning supports. 
$2,000,000 for Houston Community College 
to fund a Regional Resiliency Operations Cen-
ter (RROC) for program development, training 
and certification of disaster and mitigation pro-
fessionals. 
$1,000,000 for community mental health 
treatment and support services to the Fifth 
Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation 
in Houston to establish a juvenile justice diver-
sion program that identifies gaps in services 
and provides resources for families and their 
children who were involved in the criminal jus-
tice system. 
$2,000,000 for Texas Southern University in 
Houston to fund facilities and equipment for its 
Urban Public Health Initiative—Health Profes-
sions Education and Workforce Development 
and Health Facilities Construction and Equip-
ment Program. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for the House 
Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
2471, the ‘‘Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2022’’. 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to sup-
port the Fiscal Year 2022 omnibus bill. 
I want to thank Chair DELAURO for her lead-
ership and perseverance in bringing this omni-
bus to the finish line. It has been hard fought 
and I can confidently say that the American 
people will benefit from the investments made 
in this bill. 
Thank you, Ranking Member JOYCE, for 
your collaboration and partnership through this 
process. And thank you, Ranking Member 
GRANGER. 
For fiscal year 2022, the Interior and Envi-
ronment division provides $38 billion. 
This is an increase of almost $2 billion over 
last year’s enacted level, which is a 5 percent 
increase. 
This bill makes long-overdue investments to 
care for our planet, fight the climate emer-
gency, and meet our trust obligations to tribal 
nations. 
The bill prioritizes the protection and preser-
vation of our landscapes and biodiversity, pro-
viding $14.4 billion for the Department of the 
Interior. 
It supports the administration’s initiatives on 
climate change and affirms the role of science 
as the foundation for decision making. 
The bill provides necessary resources to 
deal with the threat of wildfires in the West, 
providing $5.5 billion for Wildland Fire Man-
agement and it invests in programs to improve 
the health of our forests and make them more 
resilient. 
The bill also includes major investments to 
clean up pollution and protect human health 
and the environment. It invests heavily in envi-
ronmental justice, and I am proud that we are 
providing an unprecedented $100 million for 
these efforts, which is a nearly 700 percent in-
crease. 
Additionally, the bill provides $3.3 billion for 
grant programs to make drinking water and 
sewer system improvements, remove lead 
from our taps, improve air quality, and 
strengthen our nation’s recycling infrastructure. 
These grants have profound impacts on 
public health and the environment, but they 
also are economic drivers that create good 
paying American jobs. 
This bill supports the Arts and Humanities 
by providing the largest increase in twelve 
years to the National Endowment for the Arts 
and the National Endowment for the Human-
ities. 
And finally, this bill supports Native Amer-
ican families by investing in a strong and resil-
ient Indian Country, including through edu-
cation and health care programs. 
The investments in this bill will improve the 
lives of Americans and I urge my colleagues 
to support the bill. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this omnibus appropriations bill. I 
want to thank Chair DELAURO, my fellow car-
dinals, and the Speaker for seeing this critical 
process through. Providing funding for the op-
eration of our federal government is among 
our most important Constitutional duties. This 
package provides critical funding for health 
care, housing and human needs. It also in-
cludes specific community project funding im-
portant to my community in the East Bay as 
well as communities across the country. 
These are crucial investments in a more hu-
mane, equitable and sustainable future. I urge 
all my colleagues to support it. 
As Chair of the subcommittee on the State 
Department and Foreign Operations, I have 
worked to ensure that this bill includes the 
support that our diplomats and development 
professionals need to contribute to a better, 
safer world. The State and Foreign Operations 
division of this bill provides $56.1 billion, which 
is $595 million above 2021. 
In addition, it includes $6.8 billion in assist-
ance to respond to the humanitarian and eco-
nomic crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine. Added to the resources in the base 
SFOPS bill, we will be better able to address 
the historic levels of global displacement and 
humanitarian need resulting from natural dis-
asters, conflict, and the pandemic. 
The bill includes $9.83 billion to support the 
health of families and communities around the 
world, a $634 million increase over last year. 
This includes $5.95 billion for PEPFAR to help 
them end the HIV pandemic by 2030, as well 
as increases for tuberculosis, global health se-
curity and maternal and child health. 
I am very proud of the steps this bill takes 
to increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and ac-
cessibility within the nation’s diplomatic and 
development workforce. The bill includes $8 
million for paid internships at the Department 
of State and robustly funds various workforce 
diversity initiatives at both the Department of 
State and USAID, including for the Pickering 
and Rangel Fellowships. 
We also added new language about non-
discrimination 
in 
humanitarian 
operations 
stemming from disturbing reports of unfair 
treatment of people fleeing the conflict in 
Ukraine. 
Unfortunately, a number of crucial invest-
ments and policy issues that I fought to in-
clude in this bill were not included in this final

agreement. We should be doing more to con-
front the climate crisis, to protect women’s 
health and reproductive rights, and pay Amer-
ica’s debts to international organizations. The 
need to overcome the filibuster in the other 
chamber blocked progress on these critical 
priorities in this bill. It’s past time to end the 
filibuster and get on with the people’s work. I 
will not stop fighting to meet these challenges 
and support the rights of Americans and all 
people to live in a more just, humane, and 
sustainable world. 
There is no question that this omnibus rep-
resents an important step forward to invest in 
America. Once again, I thank Chair DELAURO 
and the Speaker for leading this effort to make 
the critical investments in this omnibus bill, 
and I urge all my colleagues to support it. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full sup-
port of H.R. 2471, the fiscal year 2022 appro-
priations bill. 
Every Member has met with countless con-
stituents who have pleaded for Congress to do 
more to address diseases that are currently 
death sentences . . . pancreatic cancer, Alz-
heimer’s disease, glioblastoma, ALS. 
Today’s legislation delivers for those con-
stituents by providing $1 billion to create an 
independent Advanced Research Projects 
Agency for Health, ARPA–H. 
ARPA–H will embody the nimble spirit of the 
esteemed 
Defense 
Advanced 
Research 
Project Agency to pursue large-scale, high-risk 
projects. It will break the mold for federal re-
search agencies by being uniquely focused on 
solving the ‘‘valley of death’’ to deliver trans-
formational cures. ARPA–H will correct the 
gap that currently exists between the basic re-
search pursued by the National Institutes of 
Health and the development of commercial 
products by the private sector. With this mis-
sion, ARPA–H will drive scientific break-
throughs to improve our nation’s health and 
will help fulfill President Bidens promise to end 
cancer as we know it. 
I’m proud to have championed this bipar-
tisan investment in this year’s budget. 
Our work is not yet done. As Health Sub-
committee Chairwoman, I look forward to 
passing my ARPA–H bill to provide the agen-
cy the full authorities it needs to be successful 
from Day One. 
I’ve worked on this legislation over the past 
year after President Biden convened a small 
group of bipartisan and bicameral members in 
the West Wing last March to describe his vi-
sion for the agency. 
I came to Congress to solve problems and 
better the lives of the American people. It is 
with great pride and joy to vote for today’s 
budget that will fund the beginning of ARPA– 
H. This is a momentous first step in creating 
an agency that will be a beacon of hope to the 
American people. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in re-
gards to Division P, Title III—Medicare, Sub-
title A—Telehealth Flexibility Extensions, Sec 
308. Reports on Telehealth Utilizations, an 
analysis of racial and ethnic minorities as well 
as dual Medicare and Medicaid eligible bene-
ficiaries should be considered by the Commis-
sion. By not including racial and ethnic minori-
ties in this study, Congress will be unable to 
identify potential health inequities that occur 
with regard to accessing telehealth services. 
Furthermore, the inclusion of dual eligible pop-
ulations will allow Congress to account for dif-
ferences in socio-economic status with tele-
health services. By including racial and ethnic 
minorities and dual eligible beneficiaries, we 
can ensure vulnerable populations have equi-
table access to telehealth services. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 973, 
the previous question is ordered. The 
question of adoption of the motion is 
divided. 
The first portion of the divided ques-
tion is: Will the House concur in the 
Senate amendment with the matter 
proposed to be inserted as Divisions B, 
C, F, X, and Z, and titles 2 and 3 of Di-
vision N of the amendment of the 
House? 
The question is on the first portion of 
the divided question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of the motion to concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 2471 
with an amendment is postponed.

EXTENSION OF CONTINUING 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 973, I call up 
the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 75) mak-
ing further continuing appropriations 
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 
2022, and for other purposes, and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 973, the joint 
resolution is considered read. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
H.J. RES. 75 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That the Continuing Ap-
propriations Act, 2022 (division A of Public 
Law 117–43) is further amended— 
(1) by striking the date specified in section 
106(3) and inserting ‘‘March 15, 2022’’; and 
(2) in section 163, by striking ‘‘$300,000,000’’ 
and inserting ‘‘$500,000,000’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY ORDER FOR 
FENTANYL-RELATED SUBSTANCES. 
Effective as if included in the enactment of 
the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of 
the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Ana-
logues Act (Public Law 116–114), section 2 of 
such Act (as amended by Public Law 117–86) 
is amended by striking ‘‘March 11, 2022’’ and 
inserting ‘‘March 15, 2022’’. 
This joint resolution may be cited as the 
‘‘Extension of Continuing Appropriations 
Act, 2022’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for 1 
hour, equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
While we have just passed govern-
ment funding legislation, we need to 
ensure there is sufficient time for the 
Senate to process the legislation and 
for it to be enrolled for the President’s 
signature without a lapse in appropria-
tions. 
This legislation extends government 
funding to provide that necessary time, 
and I urge support. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This 4-day CR ensures that there is 
enough time for the omnibus package 
to be processed and implemented. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budg-
et, I rise in support of the rule governing de-
bate for H.J.R. 75, the ‘‘Extension of Con-
tinuing Appropriations Act,’’ which provides 
funding to continue the operations of the fed-
eral government through March 15, 2022 and 
avoids a wasteful and irresponsible shutdown, 
and also the underlying bill. 
The House, led by the Democratic majority, 
did its job, passing 10 of the 12 appropriations 
bills earlier this year but Senate Republicans 
failed to hold a single markup of appropria-
tions bills, making it necessary to pass this 
Continuing Resolution to avert a shutdown 
that would only further damage our economy. 
Throughout the 117th Congress, House 
Democrats have worked to deliver results for 
the American people, passing legislation to 
address each pillar of the ‘‘For The People’’ 
agenda: lower health care costs, higher wages 
by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corrup-
tion and strengthening our Democracy. 
And under the leadership of Speaker 
PELOSI, the House has passed hundreds of 
bills, including legislation to crush the COVID– 
19 pandemic, build our economy back better, 
lower health care and prescription drug prices, 
raise wages, advance economic and retire-
ment security, end gun violence, act on the cli-
mate crisis, protect Dreamers, and strengthen 
voting rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1414 
March 9, 2022 
For example, in this Congress the House 
has passed and sent to the President the fol-
lowing legislation that has been signed into 
law: 
1. H.R. 1799, Paycheck Protection Program 
Extension Act: 
This legislation extended the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program application deadline for two 
months through May 31, 2021 to help strug-
gling businesses keep workers employed dur-
ing COVID–19. 
2. H.R. 1276, SAVE LIVES Act; 
This law ensured that more veterans, their 
families, and caregivers got access to COVID– 
19 vaccines in a timely manner. 
3. S. 937, COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act: 
This law addresses the dramatic increase in 
hate crimes targeting the AAPI community 
since the start of the pandemic. This law des-
ignates a point person at the Department of 
Justice to review hate crimes related to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, bolsters state and local 
governments to improve their reporting of hate 
crimes and ensures that hate crime informa-
tion is more accessible to Asian American 
communities. 
4. S. 475, Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day Act: 
This law established the first federal holiday 
in 38 years to formally recognize Juneteenth 
National Independence Day and commemo-
rate the end of slavery in the United States. 
House Democrats have also worked to ad-
vance critical pieces of legislation, which await 
action in the Senate: 
1. H.R. 1, For The People Act; 
This comprehensive legislation would pro-
mote government transparency, strengthen ac-
cess to the ballot box and make it easier for 
Americans to exercise their right to vote, se-
cure election infrastructure, and curb the influ-
ence of dark money in politics. 
2. H.R. 5, Equality Act; 
The Equality Act would codify consistent 
anti-discrimination legal protections for LGBTQ 
Americans by amending several existing civil 
rights laws to include explicit non-discrimina-
tion protections in key areas of life. 
3. H.R. 6, Dream and Promise Act: 
The Dream and Promise Act would protect 
Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), 
and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) sta-
tus holders from deportation and provide an 
opportunity to obtain permanent legal status 
that would enable these groups to work legally 
within the United States and continue to con-
tribute to their local communities and econ-
omy. 
4. H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act: 
This bill would strengthen labor protections 
around equal pay by prohibiting the use of sal-
ary history to set compensation, provide more 
transparent options for joining class-action 
lawsuits challenging systemic discrimination, 
and require employers to show that gender 
pay gaps are job-related and consistent with 
business need. 
5. H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act and H.R 1446, the Enhanced Background 
Checks Act: 
These bills would modernize federal laws 
around gun sales. The former would close cur-
rent loopholes that allow buyers to purchase 
guns without a background check in certain 
venues, while the latter would prevent gun 
sales from going through before background 
checks are completed. 
6. H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act: 
This bill, which House Democrats also 
passed in the 116th Congress 30 days after 
the murder of George Floyd, will address ra-
cial bias in policing, ensure accountability for 
police brutality and misconduct, and work to 
change the culture of law enforcement to pro-
mote better relationships with the communities 
they serve. 
7. H.R 3684, INVEST in America Act: 
This bill is a comprehensive five-year sur-
face transportation reauthorization and water 
infrastructure package that would make long- 
overdue repairs to our nation’s roads, bridges, 
rail, and transit. The bill would also ensure 
clean, safe drinking water and address our na-
tion’s aging wastewater infrastructure. 
8. H.R. 842, Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize (PRO) Act: 
This bill aims to strengthen labor protections 
for union workers through overriding Repub-
lican-led ‘‘right to work’’ laws, promoting free 
and fair union elections, and holding compa-
nies that attempt to restrict union activity ac-
countable. 
9. H.J. Res. 17, Removing the Deadline for 
Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment: 
This resolution would remove the deadline 
for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment in 
order to enshrine women’s equality in the 
Constitution. 
10. H.R. 1620, Violence Against Women 
Reauthorization Act: 
This long-overdue legislation to reauthorize 
the Violence Against Women Act passed the 
House with bipartisan support. It would reau-
thorize funding to vital grant programs that 
help prevent sexual assault, domestic vio-
lence, and improve access to resources for 
victims and survivors. 
11. H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security 
Supplemental to Respond to 1/6 Appropria-
tions Act: 
This bill provides $1.9 billion in funding to 
secure the U.S. Capitol Complex and ensure 
the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol 
Police have the resources they need to do 
their jobs. The legislation responds to the di-
rect costs incurred by the National Guard and 
DC police on January 6, provides funding to 
improve the security of windows and doors in 
the Capitol complex, and secures funds to im-
prove Capitol Police training and equipment. 
12. H.R. 3005, Legislation to #RemoveHate 
from the Capitol Building: 
This bill would remove statues of those who 
perpetuated and supported slavery and seg-
regation in this country, along with statues or 
busts of those who served voluntarily in the 
Confederate States of America, from public 
display in the U.S. Capitol. 
13. H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act: 
This bipartisan bill would stabilize the agri-
culture industry’s labor supply by reforming the 
H–2A guest worker program and creating a 
pathway to citizenship for agricultural workers, 
many of whom worked through the pandemic. 
14. H.R. 51, the Washington, DC Admission 
Act: 
This bill would admit Washington, DC as the 
51st state in the Union and end the injustice 
in denying nearly 700,000 citizens the right to 
be represented fully in Congress. It would also 
end the unjust practice of treating District of 
Columbia residents differently when allocating 
government resources or relief. 
15. H.R. 3985, ALLIES Act: 
This bill would increase the visa cap and ex-
pedite the visa process for Afghan allies who 
worked alongside American military personnel, 
diplomats, development professionals, and 
partner forces, to help ensure they make it 
safely out of harm’s way. 
16. H.R. 803, Protecting America’s Wildness 
and Public Lands Act: 
This comprehensive bill would conserve and 
protect natural landscapes across America, 
designating over 1.5 million acres of public 
land as protected wilderness and withdrawing 
significant amount of public land from drilling 
and mining activities to promote a healthier 
environment. 
17. H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act: 
This bipartisan bill would improve the safety 
of Americans’ drinking water by requiring the 
EPA to set a drinking water standard, prevent 
the future release of PFAS chemicals into our 
bodies of water, and start the process of 
cleaning up affected communities. 
18. H.R. 256, Repeal of the 2002 AUMF 
Against Iraq: 
This bill, which passed with bipartisan sup-
port, would repeal the 2002 Authorization of 
Military Force Against Iraq. 
19. H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act: 
The bipartisan Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act restores protections 
for older workers that were weakened in a 
2009 Supreme Court ruling that made it hard-
er for older workers to prove age-based dis-
crimination in the workplace. 
20. H.R 2662, the Inspectors-General Inde-
pendence and Empowerment Act: 
This bill seeks to promote government 
transparency and accountability by ensuring 
the independence of federal inspectors gen-
eral, allowing government watchdogs to act 
freely without fear of political pressure or 
threats. It would also protect whistleblowers 
from threats of retaliation by making it a viola-
tion of House rules for Members to reveal their 
identities. 
In addition, three Congressional Review Act 
resolutions have been signed into law, over-
turning dangerous rules put in place by the 
Trump Administration: 
1. S.J. Res. 13, a CRA overturning an 
EEOC rule to address discrimination in the 
workplace; 
2. S.J. Res. 14, a CRA addressing dan-
gerous methane emissions; and 
3. S.J. Res. 15, a CRA to protect against 
predatory lenders. 
These along with many, many others are 
among the bills awaiting Senate action. 
Mr. Speaker, our colleagues across the 
aisle have in both chambers have been ob-
structive, dilatory, petulantly uncooperative 
throughout the first session of the 117th Con-
gress. 
Nowhere was this more apparent than the 
refusal of the majority of Republican members 
in the House voted 175–35 against H.R. 3233, 
legislation modeled after the 9/11 Commission 
establishing a National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the United 
States Capitol Complex Act. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for H.J.R. 75, 
the ‘‘Extension of Continuing Appropriations 
Act.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 973, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1420 
March 9, 2022 
have made at least two objections to-
night with respect to motions to lay on 
the table and to have reconsideration. 
And I just want to remind the Chamber 
that we are here to do the job of the 
American people. We are here to vote. 
Madam Speaker, earlier tonight, we 
had a voice vote of somewhere around 
$16 billion of continuing resolution 
spending to push forward government 
spending to the night of March 15. And 
it is my considered judgment, and the 
judgment of many of my colleagues, 
that we should have the right to debate 
that and vote on it. And we had nobody 
in the Chamber here when we thought, 
and we were under the good faith be-
lief, that we would actually have a vote 
on that tonight. 
So the purpose of forcing some votes 
tonight was to call that question and 
to remind the Chamber that it is our 
job to vote. It is our job to be here and 
do the work of the American people. 
Madam Speaker, we have not had an 
amendment on the floor of the House 
in open debate since May of 2016, to the 
best of my understanding. We need to 
restore this Chamber. We need to de-
bate. We need to vote. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I will 
withdraw my reservation of the right 
to object. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation is withdrawn.

HOUSE

tion and ask unanimous consent for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 
H. CON. RES. 79 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That in the enrollment of 
the bill H.R. 2471, the Clerk of the House of

Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘Making 
consolidated appropriations for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 2022, and for pro-
viding emergency assistance for the situa-
tion in Ukraine, and for other purposes.’’. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed 
to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 9, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to section 
1(k) of House Resolution 895, One Hundred 
Tenth Congress, and section 4(c) of House 
Resolution 8, One Hundred Seventeenth Con-
gress, I transmit to you notification that the 
following individuals each have signed an 
agreement not to be a candidate for the of-
fice of Senator or Representative in, or Dele-
gate or Resident Commissioner to, the Con-
gress for purposes of the Federal Election 
Campaign Act of 1971 until at least 3 years 
after they are no longer a member of the 
board or staff of the Office of Congressional 
Ethics: 
Michael Barnes, Paul Vinovich, Belinda 
Pinckney, Karan English, Lynn Westmore-
land, Karen Haas, Robert Hurt, William Lu-
ther. 
Omar Ashmawy, Jeffrey Brown, William 
Cable, Annie Cho, Helen Eisner, Indhira 
Benitez, Caleb Moore. 
Copies of the signed agreements will be re-
tained by the Office of the Clerk as part of 
the records of the House. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON.

I HAD TO VOTE ‘‘NO’’ 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there is no way I could vote to ex-
change getting oil from Putin for get-
ting oil from some other tyrant who 
wants 
to 
destroy 
America, 
which 
makes this a rather cynical ploy, so I 
had to vote ‘‘no’’ on Suspending Energy 
Imports from Russia Act. 
It is time to make America energy 
independent again and stop the war on 
American seniors, Americans on fixed 
incomes, and those that have to keep 
maxing out their credit cards to buy 
gas just to get to work. I had to vote 
‘‘no’’ on what is being referred to as 
the Russia bill. 
We have heard enough of the Biden 
administration lectures that Ameri-
cans should basically eat cake in their 
brand new expensive electric cars. Peo-
ple who can’t afford a tank of gas 
today can’t afford $30,000 to $150,000 for 
a new electric car. 
This bill allowed the President to 
waive the provisions we voted on, so I 
voted ‘‘no.’’

ADJOURNMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(b) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the House stands adjourned 
until 10 a.m. on Friday, March 11, 2022. 
Thereupon (at 11 o’clock and 30 min-
utes p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House adjourned until Friday, March 
11, 2022, at 10 a.m.

HONORING 
THE 
32ND 
ANNUAL 
MARTIN 
LUTHER 
KING, 
JR. 
YOUTH ORATORICAL CONTEST 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the 37th Annual Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Day Celebration and the cornerstone of the 
event, the 32nd Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Youth Oratorical Contest, hosted by the Prince 
William Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma 
Theta Sorority, Incorporated. 
Each year, the members of the Prince Wil-
liam Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta 
Sorority, Incorporated invite community mem-
bers to gather on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
to reflect upon the past year and receive a 
message of hope from the youth of today and 
leaders of tomorrow. Dr. King will forever be 
enshrined in our history as the formative figure 
in the quest for justice through civil dialogue. 
Responding through peaceful and principled 
communication to condemn the injustice of so-
cial and racial inequality, Dr. King worked tire-
lessly to establish a more fair and equal soci-
ety. Our nation still faces obstacles that Dr. 
King fought to remove, and it is imperative 
that we continue his work for our next genera-
tions. Dr. King’s words continue to inspire our 
youth, molding the future leaders of our coun-
try. 
Participants in the MLK Youth Oratorical 
Contest pay tribute to Dr. King’s legacy with 
their ability to communicate with passion and 
clarity, just as Dr. King did. This year, the 
competition challenged students to stretch 
their imaginations and bring inspirational 
meaning to Dr. King’s vision. Specifically, stu-
dents sought to honor the work of Black 
women, the unsung heroines of the Civil 
Rights Movement past and present. 
Three middle and three high school orators 
demonstrated how the vision and tireless work 
of these women aligned with Dr. King’s vision 
and maintained his legacy. I congratulate the 
following contestants and commend them for 
their participation in the 32nd Annual Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Youth Oratorical Contest: 
Mahmud lbn Abdul-Rahman Khabir—Bull 
Run Middle School, Makaya Elizabeth Free-
man—Graham Park Middle School, Shavonne 
Davis—Marsteller 
Middle 
School, 
Varsha 
Jyothikaa 
Palaniyandy—Gar-Field 
High 
School, N’Na-Mayi Akosua Tama—Osbourn 
Park High School, Kenedi Cheri Wiley—Hylton 
High School. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending the Prince William 
Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Soror-
ity, Inc. for showcasing the power of purpose-
ful and meaningful communication reminiscent 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and in congratu-
lating the talented youth of the 2022 MLK 
Youth Oratorical Contest. Let us learn from 
the young people and renew our fight against 
injustice, ensuring that all Americans will enjoy 
the equality they deserve.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
and 
applaud 
Luca 
Mestemaker for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Luca Mestemaker is a student at Drake Mid-
dle School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The 
dedication 
demonstrated 
by 
Luca 
Mestemaker is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Luca 
Mestemaker for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

RECOGNIZING THE WOMEN’S CLUB 
OF HIALEAH IN HONOR OF WOM-
EN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of Women’s History Month, I rise today 
to recognize the Women’s Club of Hialeah, 
whose dedication towards bettering Southern 
Florida and giving back to the community has 
had a significant impact on Florida’s 25th Con-
gressional district. 
The Women’s Club was founded in the 
house of Mrs. James Bright and Mrs. Lua A. 
Curtiss on May 4, 1922. These dedicated 
women lived in Hialeah and created the club 
with the goal to form a library for the city. The 
first venue used for the library was the porch 
of one of the ten members, all the books for 
the library were donated by members for the 
community. As the club started to evolve it be-
came part of the General Federation of Wom-
en’s Clubs, with their first project being art 
classes for children. The Women’s club moved 
locations of their library multiple times over the 
years and were challenged when a hurricane 
wiped away one of their sites. Regardless of 
the obstacles that had to be overcome, they 
remained hopeful and persistent. 
After many years of searching for a club-
house to call home, the Women’s Club of Hia-
leah moved into the Old Chamber of Com-
merce building in Hialeah. While there they 
held different events such as a dance for the 
Senior High students, sponsored a free clinic 
for babies, and donated dresses and clothes 
to the PTA for children in need. The club also 
worked on multiple projects around Hialeah to 
brighten the city and to eliminate pollution. 
Due to many of the projects done in Hialeah 
the Women’s Club was able to create the Hia-
leah Pollution Environmental Control Board 
that was adopted in 1971. 
The Women’s Club of Hialeah has been or-
ganizing events and acts of services for now 
100 years in May. Some of the events that 
have been held here are monthly Bunco par-
ties for seniors and others, cooking classes for 
mothers and daughters, an annual Pink Party 
to raise money and awareness for cancer re-
search, painting classes, a High School Arts 
scholarship, volunteer support with our County 
Commissioner and State Senator for Thanks-
giving food giveaways and pet adoptions. The 
club has made an overall impact to not just 
the city of Hialeah but to many in South Flor-
ida. 
Madam Speaker, as a beacon of service, it 
is truly a privilege to work with the highly es-
teemed Women’s Club of Hialeah. Their deter-
mination to help others and their continuous 
generosity in our community has never 
wavered, and I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing this outstanding club.

RECOGNIZING MARY ANN HIRN ON 
BEING NAMED THE 2022 CITIZEN 
OF 
THE 
YEAR 
BY 
THE 
CASS 
CITY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mary Ann Hirn on being 
named the 2022 Citizen of the Year by the 
Cass City Chamber of Commerce. 
Mary Ann began her career as a nurse, and 
later owned a business with her late husband 
Bob, who was named Citizen of the Year in 
2003. She has also been involved with many 
groups in the Cass City community, including 
the local Catholic church, the Cass City Histor-
ical Society, the Friends of the Thumb Octa-
gon Barn, the Friends of Rawson Memorial Li-
brary, and the Hills and Dales Hospital Auxil-
iary. 
One recommendation letter rightly pro-
claimed, ‘‘Look about and you will see her 
footprints throughout the community.’’ I thank 
Mary Ann for her years of humble service to 
the Cass City community and congratulate her 
on earning 2022’s Citizen of the Year award. 
As someone who does not do this for the at-
tention or acclamation, I am confident she will 
continue to make an imprint on the community 
she loves for years to come.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
PAUL HERZOG 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and congratulate Bradley Men’s Bas-
ketball 
Public 
Address 
Announcer, 
Paul 
Herzog, on his retirement after 45 years. 
Paul Herzog has been announcing Bradley 
University men’s basketball home games 
since the 1976–77 season. Paul had never 
missed announcing a game until the COVID– 
19 pandemic forced him out of the booth dur-
ing Bradley’s 2020–2021 men’s basketball 
campaign. During his time as the public ad-
dress announcer, Paul called 660 games 
which matched his idol’s, Willie Mays, 660 
home run total. 
Paul has always been committed to his 
work and his community. It is my privilege to 
congratulate Paul on his retirement. We have 
all been blessed to have had Paul on the 
microphone for so many memorable and piv-
otal Bradley basketball moments.

RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF 
THE 2020 FAIRFAX COUNTY FED-
ERATION OF CITIZENS ASSOCIA-
TIONS CITIZEN OF THE YEAR 
AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the recipients of the Fairfax Federa-
tion of Citizens Associations 2020 Citizen of 
the Year Awards. 
The Federation is a coalition of civic and 
homeowners associations who work together 
to promote and support initiatives that will ben-
efit all. Each year, the Federation honors indi-
viduals for their extraordinary contributions to 
our community. It is my honor to include in the 
RECORD the following individuals: 
Paul Hammack is a retired local attorney, 
who has contributed his wisdom and efforts to 
civic life in Fairfax County for decades. He 
served on the Fairfax County Board of Zoning 
Appeals for 39 years, from 1982 to 2021, and 
was its Vice-Chairman for the last 30 years. 
Paul has volunteered in many Bar Association 
activities and leadership roles, and exemplifies 
the selfless participation of attorneys in com-
munity activities. 
Lance Beets volunteers in many capacities 
for Volunteer Solutions, a program housed in 
the Fairfax County Agency on Aging. Mr. 
Beets’ efforts are directed at helping older 
adults and adults with disabilities age in place 
safely and with dignity by assisting them with 
transportation to medical appointments, gro-
cery shopping, meal and supplement delivery, 
and the prevention of social isolation. 
JoEllan Frasch has dedicated herself to 
serving the younger members of our district, 
inspiring literacy by reading stories in Fairfax 
County Public Libraries. She expanded on her 
passion for education, serving as an organizer 
for High school band, football, and chorus 
events for years. 
Jeff Parnes was a voice for interconnectivity 
in the region and a consistent presence advo-
cating for the transportation needs of the resi-
dents in Northern Virginia. Jeff has literally 
walked the walk, leading transportation re-
forms from firsthand experience on buses and 
beyond. 
James Migliaccio was the Lee District rep-
resentative on the Fairfax County Planning 
Commission from 2010 through 2019, where 
he devoted long hours to making Fairfax 
County an outstanding place to live. He cou-
pled his own talents with compassion for his 
peers to build consensus and reform county-
wide procedures for land use. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking these incredible individuals and 
in congratulating them on being honored by 
the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens’ As-
sociations. Civic engagement is the foundation 
of a healthy community, and Fairfax County 
residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life 
due in part to the efforts of these individuals. 
The contributions and leadership of these hon-
orees have been a great benefit to our com-
munity and truly merit our highest praise.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE GAZETTE 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 150th anniversary of 
The Gazette, the largest publication and 
hometown paper of Colorado’s 5th Congres-
sional District. 
On March 23, 1872, just a year after William 
Jackson Palmer founded the city, the publica-
tion began as ‘Out West.’ The paper re-
launched as ‘The Colorado Springs Gazette’ in 
1873, was known decades later as the Colo-
rado Springs Gazette Telegraph or just the 
GT, and then as ‘The Gazette’ starting in 
1997. Over time, The Gazette and the city of 
Colorado Springs have risen and fallen and 
then risen again, victoriously. 
The paper had humble beginnings, opening 
in a two-story frame house on the northeast 
corner of Tejon Street and Colorado Avenue. 
In that simpler era, the newly minted city had 
just over 2,000 residents, and a subscription 
to the four-page weekly paper cost $3 annu-
ally. 
In its 150-year history, The Gazette’s size 
and structure have reflected the community in 
which it serves. When the city was small, The 
Gazette was small. When the city grew, so did 
The Gazette. During World War II, the Pikes 
Peak region military bases had a massive in-
flux of troops and construction, which breathed 
new life into the local economy and The Ga-
zette. With business booming, The Gazette 
merged with its competitor, the Telegraph, in 
1947. 
Years later, in 1990, The Gazette was 
awarded its first Pulitzer Prize for feature writ-
ing. 
In 2012, The Gazette was purchased by 
Clarity Media Group, a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of the Anschutz Corporation. 
Soon after, The Gazette won its second Pul-
itzer Prize in 2014 for national reporting on 
combat veterans who were discharged ‘‘other 
than honorably.’’ 
Over the past decade, The Gazette has ex-
panded its reach and launched into the digital 
future. In 2020, The Gazette expanded north 
into the Denver news market, with the launch 
of the Denver Gazette. 
The Gazette is more than a newspaper for 
those living in Colorado’s 5th Congressional 
District. It is a source of meaningful, well-com-
posed news and information that reaches mul-
tiple generations of our community. For dec-
ades, The Gazette’s staff and editorial board 
have told Southern Colorado’s stories, shaped 
public opinion, and given readers something to 
think about. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join me in 
recognizing The Gazette for its legacy of deliv-
ering the news to its patrons and setting the 
bar high when it comes to quality and content. 
I commend Philip and Christian Anschutz 
and the entire team at The Gazette for their 
hard work and contributions to the Pikes Peak 
region, which have made Colorado Springs a 
wonderful place for families to live and busi-
nesses to grow. Here is to another 150 years.

HONORING CARL RAY SNODGRASS

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Carl Ray Snodgrass of Wise, Vir-
ginia, who passed away on February 3, 2022, 
at the age of 84. Mr. Snodgrass was 
foundational to the region and the Wise Coun-
ty community. 
Mr. Snodgrass graduated from J.J. Kelly 
High School and Clinch Valley College. He 
went on to serve in the United States Army 
and Army Reserves from 1960 to 1967. At the 
start of his professional career, he began 
banking with the Wise County National Bank— 
later to become President of First State Bank.

The steadfast work of Mr. Snodgrass over-
flowed into his service to his community. He 
served on the Wise Town Council and as 
Mayor of the Town of Wise. For the last three 
decades, he has been an active, vital leader 
for the economic development initiatives in 
Wise County. He devotedly served with Wise 
County Economic Development and the Indus-
trial Development Authority. He held a funda-
mental role in bringing the Dominion Power 
Plant and the Lonesome Pine Business and 
Technology Park to the area. 
Mr. Snodgrass cherished his faith and devo-
tion to the Lord. He was a member of the First 
Church of God. His life was evidence of his 
selfless heart of service unto others. He left a 
profound impact on the Wise community, and 
he will be greatly missed. 
He was proceeded in death by his parents, 
Charles Fredrick and Pearl Frazier Snodgrass; 
as well as sisters, Laura Ellen Grasham, Mary 
Arlena Little, Mavis Light, Eula Mae Conklin, 
and Velma Snodgrass; and brothers, Charles 
Sidney 
Snodgrass 
and 
William 
Albert 
Snodgrass. 
Mr. Snodgrass is survived by his wife of 58 
years, Louise Adams Snodgrass; son and 
daughter-in-law Scott and Beth Snodgrass; 
granddaughters, Lily Elkins, and her husband, 
and Emma Snodgrass; sister, Doris Aileen 
Snodgrass; and many other beloved friends 
and family. I would like to offer them my con-
dolences.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
GRADUATION 
OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE 
AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT 151ST 
RECRUIT CLASS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department and the graduates of the 
151st Recruit Class. As they prepare to join 
the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department, I encourage the six grad-
uates to reflect on the history of the depart-
ment and the contributions and dedication of 
the brave men and women who have served 
before them to protect our community. 
The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-
partment’s 151st Recruit School consisted of a 
thorough eight-week scenario and refresher 
course for prior experienced and certified fire-
fighters/EMT’s. 
These recruits have the distinct honor of 
joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-
partments in the United States. The efforts of 
the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment have been recognized across this coun-
try. Members from the Department serve on 
the elite VA Task Force 1, which is among the 
first units called to disaster zones to provide 
search and rescue support. Members of that 
Task Force were recognized by the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs with the 
Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result 
of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-
astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in 
2015. 
They also saw extensive work in Texas, 
Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands as part of disaster relief and rescue ef-
forts in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma and Maria. 
Fairfax County is fortunate to have such ex-
cellent ambassadors for our community and I 
commend them for all that they have done to 
protect lives and property not only here in 
Fairfax County, but around the world. As the 
newest members of the Fire and Rescue De-
partment, the 151st Recruit Class graduates 
join the department as integral parts of our 
community’s emergency response and public 
safety team. I am confident that this grad-
uating class will serve the residents of Fairfax 
County with honor and distinction. It is my 
great honor to include in the RECORD the 
names of the 151st Recruit Class: 
Lucas Gray 
Ivanovich Lesefka 
Michael Loblanco 
Michael Such 
Hunter Talbot 
Benjamin Wilson 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the newest members 
of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment. I thank them for their service to their 
community and to all members of the Fire and 
Rescue Department, past and present, I say: 
‘‘Stay safe.’’

Roen Casari is a student at Drake Middle 
School and received this award because his 
determination and hard work have allowed him 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Roen 
Casari is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Roen Casari for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
LIEUTENANT VAZQUEZ 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Puerto Rico’s Women 
Veterans Day with a special story that reflects 
the 
bravery 
and 
sacrifice 
of 
our 
servicemembers. Earlier this year we cele-
brated the 100th birthday of First Lieutenant 
Carmen Vazquez. Carmen was born in Cidra, 
Puerto Rico, on February 15, 1921 and was 
raised by a single mother. She chose to enlist 
as a Nursing Aide during WWII, bucking social 
conventions of the time while performing es-
sential medical care for the war’s wounded. 
For her actions, she received the WWII Victory 
Medal, 
the 
American 
Theater 
Campaign 
Medal, and the Overseas Service Bars. After 
a short interlude of peace, she would receive 
a piece of mail from President Dwight D. Ei-
senhower asking her to return to service once 
more. She again answered the call, but this 
time she served as an officer in the newly 
minted United States Air Force. Her pas-
sionate service to country reflects the very 
best our nation can offer. Her service, like the 
service of all those who have served honor-
ably in our Armed Forces, is an example for 
all of us during these difficult times when 
peace is too short, and wars are too common. 
On this Women Veterans Day, I hope we may 
all learn from Lt. Vazquez’s example of endur-
ing courage in the days to come, as each of 
us are asked to sacrifice in different ways for 
a greater good.

AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the recipients of the Fairfax Federa-
tion of Citizens Associations 2019 Citizen of 
the Year Awards. 
The Federation is a coalition of civic and 
homeowners associations who work together 
to promote and support initiatives that will ben-
efit all, Each year, the Federation honors indi-
viduals for their extraordinary contributions to 
our community. It is my honor to include in the 
RECORD the following individuals: 
Lisa Sales has been a tireless advocate in 
our community focusing on advancing civil 
rights, fighting against violence, and prohib-
iting discrimination. Her community activities 
recently have led to several key accomplish-
ments, Lisa worked closely with county offi-
cials and other community volunteers to iden-
tify a property along Richmond Highway that 
could be used to establish a new domestic vi-
olence shelter, resulting the opening of 
Artemis House. Lisa was a critical player to 
ensure Virginia’s Ratification of the Equal 
Rights Amendment. Lisa also serves on the 
Fairfax County Commission for Women. 
Dorothy Keenan has worked with older 
adults for over 45 years and has spent her ca-
reer planning and providing classes, programs 
and workshops. 
Holly Seibold is an incredible example of 
how one citizen can identify a community 
need and organize to fill it. 
Sharon Bulova was reelected as Chairman 
of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors on 
November 5, 2015. Sharon believes an in-
formed and engaged community is a well- 
served constituency. 
John Cook served on the Board of Super-
visors, representing the Braddock District from 
2009 to 2019, working to reform Fairfax’s 
criminal justice system and reduce the use of 
force in the area’s policing. 
Kathy Hudgins served on the Board of Su-
pervisors for twenty years, where she has 
championed affordable housing and advocated 
tirelessly for the Hunter Mill District. 
Linda Smyth has dedicated over a decade 
of her life to fighting for Providence District as 
their Supervisor. She has been called the 
county’s leading expert on zoning, and has 
never stopped working to ensure her commu-
nity’s needs are met. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking these incredible individuals and 
in congratulating them on being honored by 
the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens’ As-
sociations. Civic engagement is the foundation 
of a healthy community, and Fairfax County 
residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life 
due in part to the efforts of these individuals. 
The contributions and leadership of these hon-
orees have been a great benefit to our com-
munity and truly merit our highest praise.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LOUIS GREGORY III 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of former County 
Commissioner and law enforcer Louis Gregory 
III. A beloved member of our community, 
Commissioner Gregory exhibited the highest 
level of commitment to protecting and serving 
others. 
As a young man, Mr. Gregory served in the 
U.S. Marine Corps for four years before pur-
suing a career in law enforcement where he 
would continue to positively affect countless 
lives. For 38 years he climbed the ranks of the 
Atlantic Coast Line Railroad’s police agency 
before retiring as Superintendent of Police for 
CSX Transportation’s North-End region. Per-
haps most impressively, he became a member 
of the FBI’s Joint Command Staff of their anti- 
terror task force in the wake of the September 
11 attacks. 
After moving to Moore County in 2003, Mr. 
Gregory immediately began benefiting the 
lives of those in our community. Promptly 
named Chief of the Whispering Pines Police 
Department, Commissioner Gregory is remem-
bered for the lasting impact that his leadership 
had in building a strong police force of quality 
officers. To this day, his tenure is known for 
instituting a culture of excellence that helped 
drive down local crime rates. After his career 
in law enforcement, he was elected to the 
Moore County Board of Commissioners where 
he served multiple years as vice chairman. 
Among other roles, he served as the board’s 
liaison to the Board of Health and was a mem-
ber of the Transportation Advisory Board. Out-
side of local government, he served as the 
past president of the Moore County Repub-
lican Men’s Club and was a member of both 
the Masons and Rotary International. 
Commissioner Gregory passed away on 
March 5, 2022, and my thoughts and prayers 
are with his family and all who knew and loved 
him. As a Marine, member of law enforce-
ment, and County Commissioner, Commis-
sioner Gregory extended great personal sac-
rifice in dedicating himself to the service of 
others. I join our entire community in gratitude 
as we honor his extraordinary life. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Commissioner 
Louis Gregory III.

HONORING TEXAS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
HON. ROGER WILLIAMS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the many police officers who 
serve communities in Texas, and I continue to 
be inspired by their acts of heroism and dedi-
cation to protecting others. 
Now we are facing a time where there has 
been a tragic increase in police officers being 
targeted and killed while on the job as violent 
crime skyrockets across America. Last year 
alone 346 officers were shot in the line of 
duty, the highest in 20 years. 
One of Texas 25th’s own Hill County Con-
stable Kevin Cordell was shot multiple times 
while on a high-speed car chase. One bullet 
went through the windshield of the vehicle, 
struck him in the head, and exited through his 
neck. By God’s grace, he survived the shoot-
ing and recovered after surgery. 
Liberal Activists who care more about polit-
ical agendas than public safety are making our 
cities unsafe. Last year Austin, Texas sub-
mitted to the radical left’s anti-police hatred 
and cut $150 million from their police depart-
ment. This budget cut put Texas families and 
residents at greater risk for longer emergency 
response times and paves the way for law-
lessness to run wild in the city. 
Now more than ever we need to back the 
blue and restore law and order on our streets. 
May their sacrifice not be in vain, and may 
God continue to keep them safe as they work 
tirelessly to put service above self.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
GRADUATION 
OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE 
AND 
RESCUE 
DEPARTMENT 
149TH RECRUIT CLASS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department and the graduates of the 
149th Class. As they prepare to join the ranks 
of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment, I encourage the 30 graduates to reflect 
on the history of the department and the con-
tributions and dedication of the brave men and 
women who have served before them to pro-
tect our community. 
The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-
partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-
tensive and demanding 26-week program. In 
addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits 
completed nine weeks of EMT training and 
fourteen weeks of fire suppression training; 
Upon graduation, these recruits will be cer-
tified at the level of Firefighter 1/11 by the Vir-
ginia Department of Fire Programs. 
These recruits have the distinct honor of 
joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-
partments in the United States. The efforts of 
the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment have been recognized across this coun-
try. Members from the Department serve on 
the elite VA Task Force 1, which is among the 
first units called to disaster zones to provide 
search and rescue support. Members of that 
Task Force were recognized by the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs with the 
Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result 
of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-
astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in 
2015. 
Fairfax County is fortunate to have such ex-
cellent ambassadors for our community and I 
commend them for all that they have done to 
protect lives and property not only here in 
Fairfax County, but around the world. As the 
newest members of the Fire and Rescue De-
partment, the 149th Recruit Class graduates 
join the department as integral parts of our 
community’s emergency response and public 
safety team. I am confident that this grad-
uating class will serve the residents of Fairfax 
County with honor and distinction. It is my 
great honor to include in the RECORD the 
names of the 149th Recruit Class.

HONORING MAYOR GREG HANDSHY 
OF SOUTH TOMS RIVER 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Mayor Greg Handshy of 
South Toms River. A former U.S. National 
Guardsman and member of American Legion 
Post 129, Mayor Handshy continues his dedi-
cation to public service as he enters his 10th 
year as an elected official, with three of those 
years serving as Mayor. 
Greg is a retired member of Plumbers and 
Pipefitters UA Local 9 where he worked as a 
licensed plumber. True to his nature, Greg has 
always been willing to help his neighbors by 
volunteering to fix a plumbing leak or assist in 
local food bank distributions. 
His impact is felt throughout South Toms 
River through the many social programs he 
has spearheaded. He is the founder of the 
South Toms River Community Garden which 
has brought joy to green thumbs and fans of 
garden vegetables alike. He also started the 
very successful After School Homework Club 
that provides young people in the community 
both academic and recreational opportunities. 
I am so very proud to have leaders such as 
Mayor Handshy in my district and on behalf of 
all of the constituents of the New Jersey 3rd 
Congressional District, I thank Mayor Handshy 
for years of selfless service to our community.

MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH 
STILLBIRTH 
PREVENTION 
ACT 
OF 2022 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, today, I 
proudly introduced the bipartisan and bi-
cameral Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth 
Prevention Act of 2022, alongside Representa-
tive HINSON, Senator MERKLEY, and Senator 
CASSIDY. 
For too long, stillbirth has been a silent cri-
sis. According to a recent study, nearly 1 in 4 
stillbirths are potentially preventable. And the 
data comparing the United States to other 
countries informs that our nation can do more 
to prevent stillbirth. 
In our nation, an alarming 23,500 babies are 
stillborn every year. This is greater than the 
number of babies that die during the first year 
of life and more than ten times the number of 
babies that die annually due to sudden infant 
death syndrome. 
While the rate of stillbirth has declined since 
the 1940s due to improvements in maternity 
care, in recent years, the decline has slowed 
or halted. Stillbirths increase the risk of mater-
nal mortality and morbidity and negatively im-
pact parental mental health and family well- 
being. 
Like many of the health crises in our coun-
try, disparities exist, and Black women are 
over two times more likely than White women 
to have a stillbirth. Stillbirth rates are also high 
for American Indian or Alaska Native women, 
who are almost 1.5 times as likely to have a 
stillbirth compared to White women. Hispanic 
women also experience higher rates. 
Despite impacting families from all back-
grounds and women with otherwise healthy 
pregnancies, stillbirth is more common for 
women who are 35 years or older, of lower 
socioeconomic status, for women who have 
multiple pregnancies, like twins or triplets, and 
women who have already experienced the 
loss of a pregnancy. 
In addition, stillbirth also occurs more com-
monly amongst women who smoke while 
pregnant or are diagnosed with certain med-
ical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or 
obesity. 
Further, women from less advantaged back-
grounds and who are marginalized, continue 
to experience a greater burden of stillbirth. 
And these disadvantages are further impacted 
by the social determinants of health. For ex-
ample, women in maternity care deserts and 
rural areas have fewer healthcare providers. 
Nationwide, approximately 10 percent of births 
take place in counties with limited access to 
maternity care. 
According to The Lancet, in a 2016 study, 
the United States ranked number 48 out of 49 
high-income countries in annual stillbirth rate 
reduction. Furthermore, in comparison with the

same group of countries, the United States 
stillbirth rate per 1,000 births was higher than 
24 other countries. 
All the available data suggests that further 
reduction in the incidence of stillbirth is pos-
sible. And the Maternal and Child Health Still-
birth Prevention Act will help reverse this 
shocking trend of stillbirths and maternal mor-
tality in the United States. 
My bill amends Title V, the Maternal and 
Child Health Services Block Grant of the So-
cial Security Act, to clarify that stillbirth pre-
vention activities are an allowable use of 
funds. This clarification will support stillbirth 
prevention activities, thereby saving the lives 
of mothers and babies. 
In 1966, at a press conference for the Sec-
ond Convention of the Medical Committee for 
Human Rights, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
said: ‘‘Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in 
health is the most shocking and the most in-
human because it often results in physical 
death’’. 
The Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth Pre-
vention Act will help address this health injus-
tice and ensure that more babies experience 
a healthy birth and make it home with their 
families.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY 
PARK FOUNDATION 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 20th Anniversary of the 
Fairfax County Park Foundation. 
The Fairfax County Park Foundation has 
channeled the generosity of others into 
projects that benefit the entirety of Fairfax 
County. 
The Foundation has provided an avenue for 
many members of our community to give back 
in a tangible way. As the former Chairman of 
Fairfax County, and now as a Congressman, 
I understand that nonprofits are vital to meet-
ing the needs of our communities that our 
local and federal government cannot. Fortu-
nately, for the past 20 years, the Park Foun-
dation has helped to fill some of those gaps in 
funding for a host of park projects throughout 
the County. 
The Foundation has played a role in many 
of the district’s most meaningful events. From 
funding the 4–H Carnival in Frying Pan Park 
to cleaning the watershed at Hidden Oaks, 
their work has been admired by thousands of 
families. They collected contributions for open 
space preservation as well, adding to the tens 
of thousands of acres of parkland in the Coun-
ty. Each year, the Foundation’s PACT scholar-
ships allow children in supportive housing to 
attend summer camps, and it sponsors pro-
grams throughout the school year to bring 
STEM education to local students. 
Every year, the Foundation highlights com-
munity members and organizations that have 
made outstanding contributions to parks by 
presenting them with the Eakin Philanthropy 
Award. Congratulations to this year’s award-
ees: 
Individual Award: Wayne, Angela, and the 
Valis Family 
Organization Award: Fairfax Memorial Fu-
neral Home and Fairfax Memorial Park 
Friends Group/Park Volunteer Team Award: 
Friends of Colvin Mill 
Easy access to parks, green spaces, and 
recreation areas is critical to our wellbeing. 
From improving the health and wellness of 
residents to creating a healthier physical envi-
ronment, parks are vital to the future of Amer-
ica. I commend the Park Foundation for two 
decades of progress and service. I encourage 
all of you to join me in thanking the Park 
Foundation staff for many amazing years of 
work. We’re looking forward to the next twenty 
years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating the Fairfax County Park 
Foundation for their 20th anniversary. Their ef-
forts provide immeasurable benefits to their 
fellow neighbors and serve as a reminder of 
why Fairfax County remains such a great 
place to live, work, and raise a family.

HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP

Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise

commitment to bettering his community were 
as indisputable as they were indispensable. 
Bruce Lunsford began public service with 
the Mt. Orab City Council at the age of 18 and 
served as Mayor of Mount Orab for over 41 
years. 
He made a lasting impression on this Earth 
and his community. Bruce’s impact on Mt. 
Orab, Brown County, and all that knew him 
will be felt for generations as his legacy lives 
on. 
With the greatest respect, we are all forever 
grateful for the service of Mayor Bruce 
Lunsford and I am personally proud to have 
known him. 
I ask for everyone to join me in praying for 
Bruce’s wife, Becky, his family and friends, for 
the community he served, and the lives he 
touched. 
Rest in peace, Mayor Lunsford.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MEL F. 
CAMPBELL 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Mel F. Campbell 
of Chillicothe, Illinois, who passed away on 
January 12, 2022, at the age of 96. 
Mel Campbell, born on August 6, 1925 in 
New Brighton, Pennsylvania, was a distin-
guished World War II veteran who served in 
the United States military with the 87th Infan-
try Division in Europe. During his service ca-
reer, Mel received a Purple Heart after receiv-
ing wounds from a grenade in 1944. After 
being transferred to a hospital in Nancy, 
France, he quickly recovered and rejoined his 
unit just days after sustaining his injury. Only 
a few months later, he received a Silver Star 
due to the heroic role he played in capturing 
German engineers who were attempting to 
detonate charges on a bridge to delay Allied 
movements. His actions allowed Mel and his 
Regiment to cross without delay. In addition to 
receiving the Silver Star and Purple Heart, Mel 
received three Bronze Stars during his serv-
ice. 
After his military service, Mel went on to be 
a leader and pillar of his community through 
his long career as a banker and his involve-
ment in community affairs. After graduating 
from Muskingum College with his bachelor’s 
degree, Mel attended the University of Wis-
consin’s Graduate School of Banking and pur-
sued a career in banking where he worked for 
24 years. During his tenure; Mel was the 
president of the Chillicothe State Bank, and 
then became the Secretary of the J.T. Fennel 
Co. Inc. prior to his retirement in 1988. He 
continually served others throughout the com-
munity and most notably served as a member 
of the Advisory Board of Heritage Manor in 
Chillicothe, the president of the Chillicothe Ro-
tary Club, the president of the ‘‘Chillicothe De-
velopment Company, the president of the Chil-
licothe Chamber of Commerce, and a charter 
member of the Pearce Community Center. 
Through his 36 years in the central Illinois re-
gion, Mel made many contributions to better 
the lives of those in his community. 
Mel will be remembered for his love and 
commitment to his wonderfui family. He was 
preceded in death by his wife Jean, whom he 
was married to for 66 years, as well as his 
brother Richard. He was blessed with one 
son, Clyde, three grandchildren, and nine 
great grandchildren. 
I want to offer my condolences to the 
Campbell family and the people of Chillicothe 
on the loss of a great man. Mel left a lasting

HONORING CHIEF WAYNE PAYNE 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Chief Wayne H. Payne’s accom-
plished career and outstanding service to law 
enforcement in the State of Mississippi. 
Chief Wayne Payne is a native and lifelong 
resident of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. He 
graduated from Gulfport High School and 
earned his Bachelor of Science in criminal jus-
tice from the University of Southern Mis-
sissippi in 1991. Chief Payne and his wife, 
Paula, have been married since 1974 and 
have two sons, Wayne and Joey, both law en-
forcement officers. They also are blessed with 
three grandchildren, Kaitlyn, Kimberly and, 
Haily. 
Chief Payne is an accomplished public serv-
ant and Law Enforcement Executive with near-
ly 50 years of public service. In 1976, Chief 
Payne transitioned from his position as a fire-
fighter for the Gulfport Fire Department to the 
Gulfport Police Department, where he started 
as a patrol officer and quickly rose through the 
ranks. Notably, Chief Payne has served as the 
Chief of Police for the City of Long Beach, the 
Major of Operations for the Gulfport Police De-
partment, and the Chief of Police for the City 
of Gulfport. 
Chief Payne served a total of 30 years with 
the City of Gulf-port before retiring in 2004. 
After his initial retirement, Chief Payne de-
cided to continue his public service as the 
Major of Operations for the Harrison County 
Sheriff’s Department. 
In 2007, Chief Payne was selected as the 
first Chief of Police for the City of D’Iberville 
Police Department. As D’Iberville’ s first Chief 
of Police, Chief Payne has utilized his years of 
professional expertise and experience to build 
out his department and guide the next genera-
tion of police officers who serve and protect 
the State of Mississippi. 
The City of D’Iberville’s Police Department 
motto is ‘‘Serving our citizens with Dignity, 
Honor, and Integrity’’ and there is no doubt 
that Chief Payne has exemplified this saying 
throughout his many years of dedicated serv-
ice. 
Chief Payne is among many brave Mis-
sissippians who understood the risks of the 
profession, and still chose to serve our com-
munities as law enforcement officers. The sac-
rifices that Chief Payne and his family have 
made over the years have not gone unnoticed. 
On behalf of Mississippi’s fourth congressional 
district, as his Congressman I thank him and 
his family for their immense sacrifice and his 
service. 
RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF 
THE 2022 PRINCE WILLIAM COUN-
TY HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION 
AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the recipients of the 2022 
Prince William County Human Rights Commis-
sion Awards. 
On January 15, 1993, the Prince William 
Board of County Supervisors (BOCS) imple-
mented the Human Rights Ordinance which 
formally established the Prince William County 
Human Rights Commission. Two years prior, 
the BOCS had formed the Human Rights 
Study Committee to explore the needs of a 
community that was growing in population and 
diversity. After an exhaustive effort that in-
cluded numerous committee meetings and 
public hearings, the study found that many 
residents of Prince William County felt that the 
county needed a human rights ordinance and 
an agency to enforce it in order to ensure that 
every resident is treated fairly. 
The Human Rights Commission seeks to 
eliminate discrimination through civil and 
human rights law enforcement and to establish 
equal opportunity for all persons within the 
county through advocacy and education. The 
Human Rights Ordinance prohibits discrimina-
tory practices based on race, color, sex, na-
tional origin, religion, marital status, or dis-
ability, as well as in the consideration of em-
ployment, housing, public accommodations, 
education, and credit, in Prince William Coun-
ty. The Commission receives and investigates 
complaints filed by any person who believes 
that he or she has been discriminated against. 
In celebration of Universal Human Rights 
Day, the Human Rights Commission recog-
nizes individuals and organizations that pro-
mote the principles of human rights in Prince 
William County. It is my honor to include in the 
Record the recipients of the 2022 Prince Wil-
liam 
County 
Human 
Rights 
Commission 
Awards: 
Carried to Full Term; Frank Washington and 
the Coalition to Save Historic Thoroughfare; 
Prince William County Police Department; 
Tummy Yum Yum; Yaqub Zargarpur; Omicron 
Zeta Sigma Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Frater-
nity, Inc.; Pi Lambda Lambda Chapter of 
Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in commending the recipients of the 
2022 Prince William County Human Rights 
Commission Awards. Theses honorees dedi-
cate themselves to the residents of Prince Wil-
liam County and through their work, they 
make sure that all residents, including the 
most vulnerable in our society, are being 
looked out for. We owe a deep debt of grati-
tude to these honorees for their efforts to safe-
guard our most basic rights and remind us of 
our common humanity. Let us use their exam-
ple to rededicate ourselves to the fight against 
inequity and injustice. 
LAILANI AQUIRRE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Lailani Aquirre 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Lailani Aquirre is a student at Drake Middle 
School and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Lailani 
Aquirre is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Lailani Aquirre for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

CONGRATULATING LORENZO FLO-
RES 
OF 
BRIDGEPORT 
ON 
HIS 
VICTORY IN THE MLB JUNIOR 
HOME RUN DERBY 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and congratulate Lorenzo Flores of 
Bridgeport, Connecticut on his victory in the 
MLB Junior Home Run Derby on November 1, 
2021. The MLB Junior Home Run Derby is a 
free homerun hitting contest that allows young 
athletes from all over the world to practice skill 
and sportsmanship while competing for a 
chance to play in the MLB Little League World 
Series (LLWS). Over 40,000 players entered 
the competition last year, only 16 of whom 
qualified for the LLWS—Lorenzo Flores was 
one of those 16. He advanced through three 
levels of rigorous competition to clinch the title 
of 12U New England region champion and 
earn himself a trip to the Little League World 
Series. 
Lorenzo’s victory is well earned: he began 
playing baseball at the age of four and has ex-
celled in both school and sport for the past 
eight years with the love and support of his 
family and community. A student at John Win-
throp 
Elementary 
School 
in 
Bridgeport, 
Lorenzo plays for Bridgeport North End Little 
League and is a big fan of the New York Yan-
kees. He possesses a strong work ethic and 
unshakeable passion that children and adults 
alike can aspire to. I am proud to represent a 
young man like Lorenzo. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my col-
leagues join me in congratulating Lorenzo on 
this immense accomplishment.

HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA

Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 100th Anniversary 
of the Izaak Walton League of America 
(IWLA), an association of dedicated fishermen, 
outdoorsmen and women, hunters and con-

and I look forward to seeing their excellence

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I rise to cel-
ebrate Women’s History Month and its 2022 
theme—Providing Healing, Promoting Hope. 
Each year, the National Women’s History 
Project selects a unifying theme to recognize 
and promote Women’s History Month. Genera-
tions of women of every race, class, and eth-
nic background have worked tirelessly to 
make our Nation more resilient. This year’s 
theme recognizes the relentless efforts of 
women during the COVID–19 pandemic, and 
the thousands of ways they have provided 
healing and hope throughout history. 
Today, I would like to honor Sandra Noe, 
Executive Director of the Meals on Wheels in 
Northwest Indiana, who has notably brought 
healing and hope to Indiana’s First Congres-
sional District during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Sandra has worked with Meals on Wheels for 
36 years, and this organization is dedicated to 
combating senior isolation and hunger. 
During the pandemic, Sandra was on the 
frontlines delivering hot meals and making at- 
home check-ins to seniors and other home-
bound individuals. As the demand for services 
increased over the past year, Meals on 
Wheels rose to the challenge. In 2021, they 
delivered over 1,700 meals daily, provided 
over 750,000 wellness checks, and celebrated 
its nine-millionth delivery. 
Sandra is also a member of the Nutrition 
Fellow Leadership Institute, an Alumnus of 
Leadership Northwest Indiana, and serves on 
numerous local boards focused on improving 
the quality of life for the people of Northwest 
Indiana. 
Madam Speaker, as we recognize Women’s 
History Month, please join me in thanking 
Sandra and everyone at Meals on Wheels for 
the extraordinary services they provide to 
Northwest Indiana. 
Let us recommit to continuing to support 
their invaluable work and recognize this month 
and every day the invaluable ways that 
women continue to provide healing and pro-
mote hope not just in caregiving, but in all as-
pects of our society.

RECOGNIZING DIANE VAN PARYS 
IN HONOR OF WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of Women’s History Month, I rise today 
to recognize Diane Van Parys whose dedica-
tion towards bettering Florida and giving back 
to her community has had a significant impact 
on Southwest Florida. 
Born in Naples, Florida, Diane moved away 
to attend Boston College majoring in Political 
Science. Diane continued her education at the 
University of Massachusetts achieving a mas-
ter’s in business. Upon completion Diane 
began her professional career working in 
human resources, as well as sales and mar-
keting 
for 
several 
prominent 
companies. 
Throughout her career Diane’s impressive 
commitment towards helping her community 
has been notable. During Diane’s time in 
Georgia, she volunteered for multiple organi-
zations including the Republican Party, and as 
an Officer of the Forsyth County Republican 
Women. Upon her return to sunny Southwest 
Florida, Diane has remained an active mem-
ber in the community. 
Diane’s drive to continue her involvement in 
her community, specifically in Collier County 
speaks volumes. She was elected by her 
peers to serve as the President of Republican 
Women of SWFL in 2015, a leadership role 
that she still currently holds. Diane also partici-
pates in the Florida Citizens Alliance, and the 
Collier 
County 
Republican 
Executive 
Committee- Precinct Committee Woman. En-
suring her faith-based community is well-rep-
resented, Diane also serves on the board of 
St. Vincent de Paul and is President of the St. 
Elizabeth Seton Conference. Although Diane 
commitment to her community keeps her ex-
tremely busy, she does enjoy playing tennis 
and golf with her husband Mike in her free 
time. 
Madam Speaker, as a lifelong public serv-
ant, Diane has proven time and time again her 
unwavering commitment to the community and 
it is truly a privilege to know and work with 
her. With that being said, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing this outstanding indi-
vidual.

Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam

Office for H.R. 4374, the Broadband Internet 
Connections for Rural America Act. The cost 
estimate was not available at the time of the 
Committee report filing.

Hon. DAVID SCOTT,

Mandate Effects: 
Contains intergovernmental mandate? No. 
Contains private-sector mandate? No. 
H.R. 4374 would establish or reauthorize 
programs administered by the Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) to increase broadband 
connectivity in rural areas and would au-
thorize the appropriation of specific annual 
amounts over the 2022–2029 period. Because 
specific amounts are already authorized for 
most of the programs, this cost estimate ac-
counts 
for 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
amounts specified in the bill and those au-
thorized under current law. 
On net, H.R. 4374 would authorize the ap-
propriation of about $42.3 billion. Using his-
torical spending patterns for similar activi-
ties and information provided by USDA, CBO 
estimates that implementing H.R. 4374 would 
cost $9.0 billion over the 2022–2026 period, 
$33.5 billion over the 2022–2031 period and $7.0 
billion after 2031, assuming appropriation of 
the authorized amounts. 
The costs of the legislation, detailed in 
Table 1, fall within budget function 450 (com-
munity and regional development).

Components may not sum to totals because of rounding. 
a Specific authorizations already exist for these programs through fiscal year 2023. This estimate shows only the incremental increases in authorizations that would be created by H.R. 4374. CBO thus 
estimates that the bill would increase authorizations in each year over the 2022–2023 period by the difference between the amount that would be authorized by H.R. 4374 and the amounts authorized 
under current law for each of those years. 
H.R. 4374 would authorize the appropria-
tion of the following amounts over the 2022– 
2029 period: 
$4.5 billion annually for grants and loans 
under the ReConnect Rural Broadband Pro-
gram. Under current law, $350 million is au-
thorized to be appropriated annually for 2022 
and 2023. 
$300 million annually for grants and loans 
to expand rural ‘‘middle mile’’ broadband in-
frastructure. Under current law, $10 million 
is authorized to be appropriated annually for 
2022 and 2023. 
$300 million annually for grants and loans 
under the Innovative Broadband Advance-
ment Program. Under current law, $10 mil-
lion is authorized to be appropriated annu-
ally for 2022 and 2023. 
$150 million annually for grants under the 
Community Connect Program. Under current 
law, $50 million is authorized to be appro-
priated annually for 2022 and 2023. 
$150 million annually for grants and loans 
under the Distance Learning and Telemedi-
cine Program. The program received supple-
mental appropriations of $531 million in 2021. 
Because CBO estimates budgetary effects 
under 
continuing 
resolutions 
on 
an 
annualized basis, in 2022 CBO assumes that 
the same amount will be available under the 
current continuing resolution (Public Law 
117–43). Therefore, CBO estimates that H.R. 
4374 would not increase net authorizations in 
that year relative to amounts already as-
sumed in the baseline. Under current law, $82 
million is authorized to be appropriated for 
2023. The annual incremental increase that 
year is $68 million—the difference between 
the $150 million annual authorization under 
the bill and the current-law authorization of 
$82 million for that year. 
$25 million annually for USDA to provide 
technical assistance to rural communities 
under the Broadband Connectors Program. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Jon Sperl. The estimate was reviewed by H. 
Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budg-
et Analysis.

REGIONAL 
ALCO-
HOL PROGRAM LAW ENFORCE-
MENT AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Washington Regional Alcohol 
Program (WRAP) and their continued dedica-
tion to the elimination of impaired driving and 
underage drinking in the Washington metro-
politan area. 
WRAP is a public-private partnership that 
works with law enforcement, community stake-
holders, and advocacy groups in Northern Vir-
ginia, 
Washington, 
D.C., 
and 
Maryland. 
Through educational and innovative public 
programs, WRAP is credited with keeping 
Washington area alcohol related death rates 
consistently below the national average. Pro-
grams and resources include Youth Outreach, 
Adult Outreach, and Public Education pro-
grams designed to educate students and the 
general public on the dangers of alcohol and 
drugs, particularly driving while under the influ-
ence. Through the WRAP Holiday SoberRide 
program, individuals who are impaired can re-
quest a free cab ride home. In 1982, the year 
that WRAP was founded, 26,173 people in the 
United States lost their lives in alcohol-related 
car accidents; 60 percent of all traffic fatalities 
involved drunk driving. Due to the tireless ef-
forts of WRAP, other organizations such as 
MADD and SADD, local and state police, and 
enforcement of more stringent anti-drunk driv-
ing laws, alcohol-related traffic fatalities de-
creased to 9,878. But WRAP has worked tire-
lessly to ensure these statistics weren’t re-
peated. WRAP also reached the ‘‘80,000- 
served’’ level of total ridership for WRAP’s 
SoberRide 
program 
and 
nearly 
tripling 
SoberRide’s annual ridership between 2016 
and 2019. 
Since 1997, WRAP has sponsored an an-
nual Law Enforcement Awards Ceremony to 
honor local law enforcement professionals 
who have gone above and beyond the call of 
duty in the fight against drunk driving. It is my 
honor to include in the RECORD the following 
names of the 2021 Law Enforcement Award of 
Excellence recipients: 
Corporal Steven Mather—The Town of 
Herndon Police Department. 
Officer William J. Ward—Prince William 
County Police Department. 
Officer Ryan Corrigan—United States Cap-
itol Police.

ments.

Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to

RECOGNIZING THE FAIRFAX 
COUNTY HISTORY COMMISSION 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Fairfax County History Commis-
sion on the occasion of the 17th Annual Fair-
fax County History Conference. 
Since 1969, the Fairfax County History 
Commission has worked to identify, document, 
record and preserve the history of our region. 
Few areas in the country are as rich in history 
as ours. Indeed, the history of this region is 
the history of our country. The History Con-
ference provides an opportunity to reflect on 
the accomplishments of the past year and to 
recognize our neighbors who have made sig-
nificant contributions to preserving and pro-
moting our local history. Through the dedi-
cated efforts of the History Commission and 
its many volunteers, we are assured that our 
history will not be lost and will be available for 
future generations. 
This year, two of these dedicated individuals 
are being honored for their commitment to the 
preservation and education of history. I am 
proud to include in the RECORD their names: 
Ms. Maura Keaney for her tireless efforts to 
inspire the next generation of historians. As a 
School-based Technology Specialist at Laurel 
Ridge Elementary School in Fairfax County, 
Ms. Keaney utilizes online research methods 
and crosses disciplinary boundaries to explore 
quantitative analysis of how to publicly docu-
ment and celebrate history. Ms. Keaney has 
taught her students to think critically and 
quantitatively, examining the people and 
events being commemorated and who and 
what might have been left out of the narrative 
for too long. Ms. Keaney’s dedication to the 
promotion and preservation of history is only 
surpassed by her dedication to her students. 
Mr. Jeff Clark for his decades of work cap-
turing and exhibiting Fairfax County’s history. 
Mr. Clark has worked for the Fairfax County 
Public School system (FCPS) as the Video 
Producer and Director of Communication and 
Community Relations for the past 21 years. In 
his role, Mr. Clark has been able to produce 
multimedia content that tells the storied history 
of our county. He is considered to be the ‘‘offi-
cial historian’’ of the FCPS and never hesi-
tates to go the extra mile when it comes to 
preserving and showcasing Fairfax County’s 
history and its impact on the country. 
I commend the Fairfax County History Com-
mission for helping to ensure that the abun-
dance of history that is available to our com-
munity will be preserved far into the future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating all the honorees and 
thanking the Fairfax County History Commis-
sion for the important work they do for the 
Northern Virginia community.

strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for

der Dyer for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge

no doubt he will exhibit the same dedication 
and character in all of his future accomplish-
ments.

IN MEMORY OF MOTOR MACHINIST

CLASS 
ROGER 
H. 
SPOONER 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today, to pay tribute to an 
extraordinary sailor, World War II veteran, and 
dedicated civil servant, Mr. Roger H. Spooner, 
who transitioned from labor to reward on 
Thursday, February 24, 2022, at the age of 
99. His funeral service was held on Sunday, 
February 27, 2022, at 3:00 p.m. under the 
‘‘Spooner Oak’’ on Bartow Gibson Highway in 
Seminole County, Georgia. 
Roger Hern Spooner was born November 
18, 1922, as one of eight children to the union 
of Lewis and Delia Spooner. In his pursuit of 
a life outside of farming, Roger answered the 
calI to serve his nation when he enlisted in the 
U.S. Navy in October of 1941 at the age of 
18. After completing boot camp, he was sent 
to the aircraft carrier, USS Yorktown, with a 
destination of Pearl Harbor, which had just 
been bombed. After arriving at Pearl Harbor 
and witnessing the remnants of damage and 
lingering smoke from the invasion, the crew of 
2,500 sailors headed to the coast of Australia. 
In May of 1942, during the Battle of the Coral 
Sea, Roger saw action when the USS York-
town endured damage, and the crew suffered 
61 casualties. Following the gruesome battle, 
the carrier and crew returned to the Navy yard 
at Pearl Harbor for repairs. Once repairs were 
made, the crew made their way to Midway Is-
land to join other ships in preparation for the 
Battle of Midway, which took place in June of 
1942. Many historians consider it to be the 
most important battle in the Pacific during 
World War II as it was a clash between the 
U.S. Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy six 
months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
During the Battle of Midway, the USS York-
town incurred a massive hit beyond repair,

and the crew was told to abandon ship. One- 
by-one every crew member went down a line 
into the water with their life preservers into 
water that was so oily that once they were 
covered, you could only see the whites of their 
eyes. After being stranded afloat for a day, 
Roger and his crewmates were rescued. 
Roger served another four years in the 
Navy, where he attended submarine school 
and completed nine war patrols out of Perth, 
Australia. He was later discharged from the 
Navy as a Motor Machinist Mate Second 
Class, after being involved in a motorcycle ac-
cident. Following his military service, he con-
tinued to serve his community and make an 
impact in the lives of others by serving his fel-
low Veterans as a member of the American 
Legion Post 157, Donalsonvile. 
In addition to serving, farming, and raising 
his family, Roger also ventured into the truck-
ing industry. He worked for a company for al-
most 18 months before he decided to go into 
trucking for himself in 1948. From there, he 
started his company, Spooner Farms Truck-
ing, LLC. His first truck was a 1940s model 
‘‘gas burner’’ GMC, but over the years, he ac-
quired several Kenworths and Peterbilts. Rog-
er’s sons, David and Dennis; and his grand-
son Jake, joined his trucking business, which 
had as many as seven trucks running and al-
ways transported produce within a 125-mile 
radius of the shop. 
Roger’s love for his wife, his service, and 
his passion remained active until his passing. 
As such, he made sure to renew his licenses 
and maintain the upkeep for his 1999 Peterbilt 
379 affectionately named ‘‘Miss Eloise’’, which 
he used to haul agricultural products, including 
bagged and liquid commodities. The truck’s 
number (CV5) represented the USS York-
town’s identification number with a 12.7 Detroit 
engine and a 10-speed. 
Mr. Roger H. Spooner lived his life by the 
Golden Rule which states ‘‘Do unto others as 
you would have them do unto you.’’ A man of 
great morals, he demonstrated this principle 
throughout his career and life, outstanding 
achievement, service, and public distinction. 
Our community, our state, and our Nation are 
better because of him. 
Roger accomplished much in his life, but 
none of it would have been possible without 
the Grace of God and the love and support of 
his family including his late wife, Eloise; and 
his sons; David and Dennis, and his grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of Georgia’s Second Congres-
sional District, in honoring the life and legacy 
of Mr. Roger H. Spooner for his remarkable 
service to his community, his nation and to hu-
mankind. Moreover, we extend our deepest 
sympathies to his family, friends, loved ones, 
and all who grieve during this difficult time of 
bereavement. We pray that they will be con-
soled and comforted by an abiding faith and 
the Holy Spirit in the weeks, months, and 
years ahead.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
BISHOP DANIEL JENKY 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate Bishop Daniel Jenky, the 
Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Peoria, who 
is retiring after 20 wonderful years of service 
across Central Illinois. 
Bishop Jenky attended the University of 
Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, where he 
obtained his Bachelor of Arts and Master of 
Theology degrees. Bishop Jenky spent the be-
ginning of his service in the priesthood at his 
alma mater, the University of Notre Dame, 
where he spent 25 years as a priest and as 
Rector of the Sacred Heart Basilica. He was 
later ordained as Auxiliary Bishop of the Dio-
cese of Fort Wayne-South Bend in December 
1997. Bishop Jenky served as the Auxiliary 
Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend for five 
years until his next appointment as Bishop to 
the Catholic Diocese of Peoria. 
Appointed by Pope John Paul II in February 
of 2002, Bishop Jenky served the Diocese of 
Peoria for two decades. His passion about 
Catholic education and supporting the poor 
and marginalized led to numerous community 
projects, most notably, the diocese’s construc-
tion of the Spalding Pastoral Center and 
Sacre-Coeur Retreat Center. In addition, 
Bishop Jenky led the charge as the primary 
advocate for the canonization of Archbishop 
Fulton J. Sheen, a Peoria, Illinois native. 
Bishop Jenky’s commitment to lead, edu-
cate, and strengthen the Roman Catholic com-
munity embodies the attributes of a true serv-
ant of Christ. As a native of Peoria and prac-
ticing Catholic, it is my privilege to honor and 
thank Bishop Jenky for being a faithful servant 
to Illinois’ Eighteenth Congressional District.

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Roger Hollandsworth of Floyd, Vir-
ginia, who passed away on January 27, 2022, 
at the age of 64. Mr. Hollandsworth served the 
Floyd County community as an emergency 
first-responder and a businessman. 
Mr. Hollandsworth was a graduate of Floyd 
County High School and Virginia Tech. For 33 
years, he was the owner of a cherished Floyd 
business, the Xpress Market. Through his 
business, he graced everyone that walked in 
with his kindness and friendly nature. 
His love and service toward others were re-
flected in his work as a member of the Floyd 
County Lifesaving and First Aid Rescue 
Squad. He faithfully served for more than 40 
years. Throughout the majority of that time, he 
acted as the squad’s treasurer. 
Community members and fellow Rescue 
Squad members speak very highly of Mr. 
Hollandsworth and his legacy in Floyd County. 
There have been countless rescue stories dis-
playing his courage and heroism. His kindness 
on and off the job made a profound impact on 
all who knew him. He will be greatly missed. 
He was preceded in death by his parents, 
Ray and Rowena Albert Hollandsworth; and 
brother, Don Wayne Hollandsworth. 
His survivors include his wife of 39 years, 
Jennifer R. Hollandsworth; son, Dustin N. 
Hollandsworth and his wife; grandchildren, 
Shauna, Garrett, Kylie, Wyatt, Arick, Lilah and 
Emberly, as well as many other loved ones. I 
offer my condolences on their loss.

ASSISTANT 
POLICE 
CHIEF DAWN HARMAN 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career of Prince Wil-
liam County Assistant Police Chief Dawn Har-
man and to congratulate her on her retirement 
following 30 years of dedicated service to 
county residents. 
The Prince William County Police Depart-
ment was founded on July 1, 1970 and serves 
as the primary law enforcement agency for the 
county and the towns of Dumfries, Occoquan, 
Haymarket, and Quantico. At the time of its 
founding, the Department had a staff of 52 
which included police officers, commanders, 
dispatchers, and secretaries, with an operating 
budget of $750,000. Today, the Department 
has grown to nearly 1,000 individuals with an 
annual operating budget of $116 million. 
Major Dawn Harman is a life-long resident 
of Prince William County and graduated from 
Garfield High School. She graduated from 
West Virginia University with a bachelor’s de-
gree in Animal and Veterinary Science, she 
was hired by the Police Department as a Dep-
uty Animal Warden in September 1991, and 
then promoted as a Police Officer in January 
1994. 
Throughout her 30-year career with the Po-
lice Department, Major Harman served in nu-
merous assignments including animal control, 
patrol operations, crime prevention, accredita-
tion, and support services. She rose quickly 
through the ranks due to her exemplary lead-
ership and commitment to improving the agen-
cy. She served as the Director of the Animal 
Control Bureau and the Western District Com-
mander before being promoted to the rank of 
Major in September 2014. She holds the dis-
tinction of being the first female Assistant 
Chief in the Department’s history. 
Through her time as an Assistant Chief, 
Major Harman worked on several capital im-
provement programs including the planning

and construction of a new Animal Services 
Center and the expansion of the Public Safety 
Training Center. While serving her community, 
she also obtained a Master of Public Adminis-
tration from George Mason University, where 
she has served as an adjunct faculty member 
in the Department of Criminology, Law, and 
Society. 
Throughout her career, Major Harman has 
made a positive impact in every assignment 
she has held, always looking for ways to im-
prove the Department’s ability to provide qual-
ity services to the community. Her profes-
sionalism and commitment to service have left 
a lasting impact on the police department and 
the citizens of Prince William County. Major 
Harman made it a priority throughout her ca-
reer to mentor and develop the next genera-
tion of leaders ensuring the continued success 
of the department. 
Her husband Mark is a retired member of 
the Police Department as well, and they have 
four children who were all born and raised in 
Prince William County. Two of her sons are 
also members of the Police Department, car-
rying on Dawn and Mark’s legacy of public 
service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending the 30-year career of As-
sistant Police Chief Dawn Harman with the 
Prince William County Police Department and 
thanking her for her tireless service to our 
community. I wish Major Dawn Harman and 
her family continued happiness and success in 
all things.

2022 INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S 
DAY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the, 2022 
International Women’s Day as an important 
time to celebrate women and the great strides 
made with gender equality. Today is an oppor-
tunity to highlight the tremendous accomplish-
ments of women all over the world for their 
achievements and continue the work to appre-
ciate our differences whether national, ethnic, 
linguistic, cultural, economic or political and 
celebrate those who help pave the way for fu-
ture generation. 
Women’s rights are an important issue for 
our country. As a father of daughters, I value 
the contributions women make to our country 
and our communities. That is why I supported 
both the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help close the gen-
der gap that currently exists between men and 
women. We must work to ensure equal pay 
for equal work and support women and their 
families in the workplace and at home. On a 
global scale, the United Nation’s Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimina-
tion Against Women (CEDAW) is working to 
ensure the rights of women in every country. 
I support these efforts and all other efforts to 
ensure women are treated equally in the 
United States and across the world. 
I extend my deepest gratitude to all 
attendees today for recognizing the contribu-
tions of women around the world and cele-
brating the 2022 International Women’s Day.

FULL EQUALITY FOR PUERTO 
RICO 
SPEECH OF 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 105th anniversary of 
Puerto Ricans gaining the right to U.S. citizen-
ship. For the past 105 years, Puerto Ricans 
have served this country with the utmost dis-
tinction, especially the more than 235,000 
Puerto Ricans that have donned this country’s 
uniform. 
During this time of celebration, I would also 
like to bring to the House’s attention the Puer-
to Rico Statehood Admission Act, which would 
grant Puerto Rico statehood. I wholeheartedly 
support this bipartisan piece of legislation that 
simply executes the wishes of the people of 
Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans have spoken, and 
it is time for us to listen. 
As a Member of Congress from a territory, 
I can tell you that a lot has been said in recent 
years about the status of U.S. territories and 
their place in America. A lot of the noise that 
has been generated has been from people 
and groups outside the territories, who cannot 
comprehend the complexities of life in the ter-
ritories. In my view, it is up to the people in 
each of our territories to express their wishes 
for their own futures. 
This bill is the manifestation of those exact 
wishes. On November 3, 2020, a majority of 
Puerto Ricans answered with an emphatic 
’Yes’ when asked if they wanted to be a state. 
No ifs, ands; or buts. 
It is our duty as Members of Congress to 
immediately follow through on the demands of 
the people of Puerto Rico, and anything less

SUSPENDING TRADE RELATIONS 
FOR RUSSIA BELARUS ACT 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, this 
weekend, I heard direct pleas for help from 
President Zelenskyy. 
He asked for defense resources and sup-
plies. 
He asked us to cripple Russia’s economy. 
We heard his pleas and are acting with ur-
gency. 
Russia must be removed from the World 
Trade Organization for its unprovoked invasion 
of Ukraine. 
There is no good reason for Russia to be 
part of our international and trade commu-
nities. 
Good neighbors don’t invade sovereign na-
tions. 
We are using America’s economic might to 
isolate Russia as a pariah to the whole world. 
Today, we take an essential step to weaken 
Putin and cripple his ability to save Russia’s 
teetering economy. 
In 2019, our former President withheld mili-
tary aid from Ukraine to extort President 
Zelenskyy. 
Then, 100 percent of House Republicans 
turned their backs on Ukraine. But I hope Re-
publicans will support Ukrainians in their hour 
of need today.

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I want to com-
mend the authors of the Department of De-
fense Fiscal Year 2022 Appropriations bill for 
including funding for two programs that work 
in concert to stand up critically needed, se-
cure, leading-edge domestic semiconductor 
manufacturing technology. 
Specifically, the additional $20 million in 
funding for the Industrial Base Analysis and 
Sustainment Program’s (IBAS) machine tool-
ing and advanced manufacturing within the 
Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, 
Defense-Wide account; and additional $10 mil-
lion in funding for Aerospace Sensors’ zero- 
trust environment for semiconductor tech-
nology within the Research, Development, 
Test and Evaluation, Air Force account. 
Microelectronics support nearly all DoD ac-
tivities, enabling capabilities such as the global 
positioning system, radar, command and con-
trol, and communication. Ensuring secure ac-
cess to leading-edge microelectronics, how-
ever, is a challenge. The pandemic has shined 
a light on the challenges associated with the 
global supply chain, the changing global semi-
conductor industry, and the sophistication of 
U.S. adversaries, who might target military 
electronic components. 
I am proud of the work being undertaken in 
my district, at NeoCity, to support domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing technology de-
velopment as they work to address the supply 
chain. I believe Congress should continue to 
provide the resources necessary to update our 
domestic microelectronics security framework 
and I look forward to continuing to work with 
my colleagues to support this goal.
