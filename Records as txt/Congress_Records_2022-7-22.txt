The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Compassionate God, as we approach 
You at the end of our workweek, tried 
and tested by the many concerns that 
have crossed our paths, we lay our bur-
dens before You, that You would make 
good of them in Your perfect plan. 
We cast on You all our anxiety over 
what we have done, what we have left 
undone, and what remains to be done, 
because in the midst of all that we 
struggle with and tend to each day, we 
dare to believe You care for us. 
By Your steadfast love then, give us 
reason to hope that You will sustain 
us. By Your righteousness, give us cer-
tainty that all we have done in faith 
will serve to contribute to Your will 
for this place and for our Nation. By 
Your abiding presence, relieve our 
worry for tomorrow, for all our days 
are in Your hand. 
Upheld by Your everlasting arms, 
and in the strength of Your name, we 
pray. 
Amen.

support of H.R. 7002, the Gateway Solidarity 
Act, which would authorize the illumination of 
the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, by 
blue and yellow lights for a certain period of 
time to show support and solidarity with the 
Ukrainian people. 
It has been five months since Russia in-
vaded Ukraine, and the relentless pain caused 
to the Ukrainian people has not subsided. 
Families are being separated by war, adults 
and children are being ruthlessly killed, and a 
rogue Russia is violently crushing political 
speech from its own citizens who oppose the 
war. 
The threat and aggression by Russia has 
persisted despite global resistance. 
This act of aggression on the part of Russia 
creates instability in the region and places at 
risk the over 70 years of global peace that fol-
lowed World War II. 
The lives of all Ukrainians matter at this mo-
ment, and we must do what we can while we 
can to stop Russia’s assault on the people of 
Ukraine and its democratically elected govern-
ment. 
As President Biden so aptly stated, ‘‘We ei-
ther back the Ukrainian people as they defend 
their country or stand by as Russia continues 
its atrocities and aggression.’’ 
The United States must continue to support 
Ukraine during their time of war. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
7002, the Gateway Solidarity Act. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the 
Ukrainian people during their darkest hour.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF REILLY ALBERT RIDGELL 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 22, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Reilly Al-
bert Ridgell. Reilly was an esteemed author, 
devoted educator, and inspiring leader whose 
scholarship and stories have and continue to 
impact our island, region, and nation. Our 
community will fondly remember him as a pas-
sionate advocate and ally whose contributions 
meaningfully cultivated new spaces for Pacific 
peoples to rise. 
After graduating from Pacific Palisades High 
School, Reilly earned a bachelor’s degree in 
political science from the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles. By 1970, he obtained a 
master’s degree in the field from the University 
of California, Santa Barbara and soon after, 
answered the call of the Peace Corps in the 
Western Islands of Chuuk, Micronesia. Work-
ing to advance the organization’s mission to 
realize greater inclusion and global equity, 
Reilly served as a teacher in the island state 
for a total of four years. He further expanded 
his contributions and involvement across the 
region to include opportunities in Guam as a 
private school teacher, progressive rock disc 
jockey, and as an assistant professor and 
Dean of Trades and Professional Services at 
the Guam Community College (GCC). 
Upon identifying an evident void in teaching 
materials about the Pacific Islands, Reilly took 
it upon himself to begin the important work of 
closing a persisting gap in knowledge. Fol-
lowing extensive research, countless hours of 
writing, and meaningful collaborations, he pub-
lished two textbooks, an anthology of Peace 
Corps stories, and two novels entitled Pacific 
Nations and Territories, Pacific Neighbors, 
Bending to the Trade Winds, Green Pearl Od-
yssey, and Isla Vista Crucible, respectively. 
Since 1983, thousands of copies of his works, 
their subsequent editions, and numerous de-
rivatives have been sold and continue to be 
used extensively across the Pacific. Moreover, 
his works have gained several regional and 
national accolades including Regional Lit Cat-
egory honorable mention and Compilations/ 
Anthology Category 1st place at the 2015 Pa-
cific Rim Book Festival, top honors at the 
2014 Southern California Book Festival, and 
honorable mention at the Eric Hoffer Book 
Awards. 
Reilly Albert Ridgell was an innovative writer 
and changemaker who continues to inspire 
many throughout our island and region. His 
dedication to amplifying the voices, stories, 
and histories of our Pacific people has materi-
ally elevated our presence in classrooms far 
beyond our borders, actively shaped our com-
munity consciousness, and empowered our 
people with greater sociopolitical agency. My 
family and I wish to extend our hearts and 
prayers for Reilly, his wife, Blora; their chil-
dren, Clynton and Joel; and the rest of their 
family and friends, and I join the people of 
Guam in remembering and celebrating his life 
and legacy of directing one’s personal gifts 
and passions toward uplifting others. He will 
be dearly missed, and his love and memories 
will forever remain in the hearts of the people 
of Guam.

RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 8404, 
the ‘‘Respect for Marriage Act.’’ 
This Act would enshrine in federal law mar-
riage equality for same sex and interracial 
couples. 
I would also repeal the discriminatory De-
fense of Marriage Act (DOMA) of 1996 that 
problematically defined marriage as between 
one man and one woman. 
The Supreme Court’s backwards ruling in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion that was used to justify overturning the 
right to abortion could be weaponized in the 
future to strip away other fundamental rights, 
including the right to marriage equality. 
In his concurring opinion in Dobbs, Justice 
Clarence Thomas explicitly called on the Su-
preme Court to reconsider its decisions pro-
tecting other fundamental rights, including the 
right to same-sex marriage recognized in 
Obergefell v. Hodges. 
Although 
Justice 
Thomas 
conveniently 
chose not to mention the right to interracial 
marriage—a right he currently enjoys—that 
right relies on the same constitutional doc-
trines as the right to same-sex marriage, and 
therefore, could also be on the chopping 
block. 
The Supreme Court’s rulings in Loving v. 
Virginia, and Obergefell v. Hodges were 
founded on the promise of unenumerated 
rights and due process for all American people 
as guaranteed in the 9th and 14th Amend-
ments of our Nation’s Constitution. 
The 9th Amendment states that the Federal 
Government does not retain final authority 
over rights not listed in the Constitution—in-
cluding the right to marry someone regardless 
of their sex or race. 
No, that very personal and intimate right, re-
mains retained by the people. 
Additionally, the 14th Amendment ensures 
that no right afforded to the American people 
can be taken away without due process of 
law, while also guaranteeing to all Americans 
that they shall have equal protection under the 
law. 
Equal protection under the law. 
The same law that applies to a Black man 
wishing to marry a Hispanic woman must be 
applied equally to an Indigenous woman wish-
ing to marry a White woman, a nonbinary indi-
vidual wishing to marry a man, and so on. 
That is the constitutional promise in the 
United States. 
Marriage equality is not a right that can be 
stripped away by a conservative faction of the 
United States Supreme Court, nor by extrem-
ist Republican legislators. 
It is a fundamental aspect of our democ-
racy. 
The assurances of the 14th Amendment be-
came part of our national governing docu-
ments as a protection against those who 
would use their power to wipe away the free-
doms of others without restraint or consent of 
the governed. 
It is unfortunate that we must rely on its 
strength again today. 
The night before the Dobbs ruling, LGBTQI+ 
couples and people in interracial relationships 
went to sleep confident in the legality of their 
marriages. 
They had no reason to believe that the next 
morning five individuals would pass a ruling

July 22, 2022 
that would strip women of their right to abor-
tion and threaten the legality of their marriage 
unions. 
On June 24th, amidst the horror of the 
Court’s ruling against abortion rights, innocent 
LGBTQI+, Black, and Brown people had to 
also grapple with the possibility that the legal-
ity of their marriages might be violently 
stripped away. 
We cannot and will not allow Republican 
lawmakers and conservative Justices to toy 
with the rights of the American people. 
That is why I strongly support the Respect 
for Marriage Act. 
This act would ensure that an individual be 
considered married as long as the marriage 
was valid in the State where it was performed. 
This ensures that same-sex and interracial 
couples would continue to enjoy equal treat-
ment under Federal law—as the Constitution 
requires. 
This bill would go further by officially repeal-
ing the Defense of Marriage Act. 
While the Supreme Court effectively ren-
dered DOMA inert with its decision in 
Obergefell, this unconstitutional and discrimi-
natory law, however, still officially remains on 
the books. 
Therefore, H.R. 8404 would repeal DOMA 
once and for all. 
The Respect for Marriage Act would also 
prohibit any person acting under color of state 
law from denying full faith and credit to an out- 
of-state marriage based on the sex, race, eth-
nicity or national origin of the individuals in the 
marriage. 
It would also authorize the U.S. Attorney 
General to enforce these protections and 
would create recourses of action for any indi-
vidual harmed by a violation of this provision. 
If conservative lawmakers and Justices want 
to wage war against human and civil rights, 
we are ready to meet them toe for toe. 
We will meet them with the full strength of 
the United States Bill of Rights to defend the 
American people against discrimination and in-
justice. 
We will not back down for marriage equality. 
We will not back down for racial justice. 
We will ensure equal rights for all American 
people. 
I strongly put my full support behind H.R. 
8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, and en-
courage my colleagues to do the same.

ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS-CEN-
TERED 
INTERNATIONAL 
CON-
SERVATION ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 18, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 7025, the ‘‘Advancing 
Human Rights-Centered International Con-
servation Act of 2022.’’ 
H.R. 7025 is a bipartisan effort instructing 
the Director of the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service from funding entities that com-
mit, fund, or support gross violations of inter-
nationally recognized human rights, and for 
other purposes. 
This legislation provides procedures on how 
to identify human rights violators including: 
A concrete framework of requirements for 
an international entity to apply for and receive 
a conservation grant. 
Creating a Social Safeguards Plan that will 
implement appropriate human rights standards 
and prevent gross violations of internationally 
recognized human rights in connections with 
activities funded under the award. 
Reporting requirement for grant recipients 
who stand accused of violating international 
human rights. 
Generating a formal review process that 
would include an investigation and may re-
quire the grant recipient to address the alleged 
violation. 
I applaud the efforts of my colleague, Con-
gressman GRIJALVA and his office for uplifting 
this issue. 
Through this effort, we are reminding the 
American people that the fight against environ-
mental degradation must go hand in hand with 
Congress’ commitment to uphold human rights 
across the globe. 
I know firsthand the importance of environ-
mental conservation efforts both at home and 
abroad. 
In my home state of Texas, about 1,300 
species of plants and animals are currently on 
the endangered list, diminishing our biodiver-
sity. 
Several economic sectors including agri-
culture depend on natural resources so we 
need to make sure that we are facing the ef-
fects of the climate crisis head-on. 
These grants from the Fish and Wildlife 
Service will equip us with the tools to ensure 
clean air, land and water will be accessible to 
our children. 
When enacted, H.R. 7025 will lay out a for-
mal procedure to curtail those seeking finan-
cial assistance from the U.S. but clearly do not 
have a respect for human rights. 
This legislation sends a clear message that 
recipients of conservation grants funded by 
the American taypayer must respect American 
values. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H.R. 7025 to confront those 
who continue to violate human rights around 
the world and uplift the democratic values we 
work to protect.

EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE 
SOVEREIGN 
DECISION 
OF 
FIN-
LAND AND SWEDEN TO APPLY 
TO JOIN THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO) 
AS WELL AS CALLING ON ALL 
MEMBERS OF NATO TO RATIFY 
THE PROTOCOLS OF ACCESSION 
SWIFTLY 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 18, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H. Res. 1130: Expressing support 
for the sovereign decision of Finland and Swe-
den to apply to join the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) as well as calling on all 
members of NATO to ratify the protocols of 
accession swiftly. 
The resolution expresses support for Fin-
land and Sweden’s historic decision to apply 
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) and opposes any attempt by the Rus-
sian government to obstruct Finland and Swe-
den’s decision to apply to join NATO. 
The bill also calls on the member states of 
NATO to formally support the accession of 
Finland and Sweden into the transatlantic alli-
ance. 
Finland and Sweden have worked with the 
NATO alliance for nearly thirty years, and they 
are widely regarded as capable security part-
ners. 
They joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace 
in 1994 and both contributed personnel to 
NATO-led operations in Afghanistan, the Bal-
kans, and Iraq. 
In 2014, they became two of just six En-
hanced Opportunity Partners and have since 
worked to increase their militaries’ ability to 
operate with NATO forces. 
Sweden recently hosted more than a dozen 
NATO allies and Finland in BALTOPS 22, a 
major maritime exercise in the Baltic Sea. 
Both nations are EU members and solid de-
mocracies with sophisticated economies, se-
cure borders, and highly advanced militaries. 
There is no question that Finland and Swe-
den are well-equipped to join NATO. 
There is also no question that Russia’s ag-
gression will not diminish. 
With a reported death toll of over 10,000 
soldiers and civilians, there is no guarantee 
that nearby nations are safe from mass de-
struction. 
Russia has a long history of invading and 
annexing bordering countries, which is all the 
more reason for fortifying the NATO alliance. 
We must do everything in our power to put 
an end to the violence continually caused by 
Russia and bring back peace to the region. 
Finnish and Swedish membership in NATO 
will stretch NATO’s borders and bolster our 
collective defenses in northern Europe. 
Finland shares an 830 mile border with Rus-
sia, which would more than double Russia’s 
border with NATO. 
Sweden’s defense budget for 2022 is esti-
mated to total $8.6 billion, while Finland’s is 
$6.3 billion, according to the Global Firepower 
Index. 
Both Sweden and Finland have announced 
plans to dramatically boost their military 
spending in response to Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 
1130: Expressing support for the sovereign 
decision of Finland and Sweden to apply to 
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) as well as calling on all members of 
NATO to ratify the protocols of accession 
swiftly.
