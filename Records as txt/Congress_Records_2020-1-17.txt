THE FOUNDER’S DAY OF ALPHA 
KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority for 
its extraordinary legacy and work it does all 
throughout the nation. 
On January 15, 1908, nine college students 
on the campus of Howard University in Wash-
ington, D.C. founded Alpha Kappa Alpha So-
rority. 
These nine courageous women founded this 
sorority right before WWI and only a few years 
after Reconstruction. 
From the core group of nine at Howard, 
AKA has grown into a force of more than 
290,000 collegiate members and alumnae, 
constituting 1,007 chapters in 42 states, the 
District of Columbia, the US Virgin Islands, the 
Bahamas, Germany, Liberia, South Korea, 
Japan, Canada, South Africa and the Middle 
East. 
I take great pride in my sorority’s tradition of 
service and the many programs that it has es-
tablished to serve our communities. 
One of the founders, Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, 
dreamed of creating a support network for 
like-minded women coming together for mu-
tual uplift, and coalescing their talents and 
strengths for the benefit of others. 
What began as a small band of sisters in 
1908, transformed over the ensuing 112 years 
into a globally-impactful organization of nearly 
300,000 college-trained members, bound by 
the bonds of sisterhood and empowered by a 
commitment to servant-leadership that is both 
domestic and international in scope. 
As Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority has grown, 
it has maintained its focus in two key arenas: 
the lifelong personal and professional develop-
ment of each of its members; and galvanizing 
its membership into an organization off formi-
dable power and influence, consistently at the 
forefront of effective advocacy and social 
change that results in equality and equity for 
all citizens of the world. 
I want to salute Dr. Glenda Baskin Glover, 
the 30th International President of Alpha 
Kappa Alpha Sorority who is currently leading 
the mission to cultivate and encourage high 
scholastic and ethical standards, to promote 
unity and friendship among college women, to 
study and help alleviate problems concerning 
girls and women in order to improve their so-
cial stature, to maintain a progressive interest 
in college life, and to be of ‘‘Service to all 
mankind.’’ 
One of our native Houstonians who led our 
beloved sorority was Mattelia Grays. As Na-
tional President, Grays’ focus included chapter 
programs designed for specific community that 
the chapter served, educational grants, Job 
Corps and leadership training. 
I would also like to acknowledge Faye Bry-
ant, the 21st International President of Alpha 
Kappa 
Alpha 
Fraternity. 
Another 
native 
Houstonian, under her leadership the theme of 
the AKA Sorority became P.O.W.E.R. During 
her tenure, Bryant also created the Alpha 
Kappa Alpha Connection, completed construc-
tion on the Sorority’s national headquarters 
and initiated the African Village Development 
Program in collaboration with Africare. 
For over a Century Alpha Kappa Alpha has 
been the foundation of the Sisterhood that 
helps to focus the energies and talents of Afri-
can American women on some of the most 
daunting social, cultural and economic prob-
lems our communities face. 
The 
AKA 
Sisterhood 
has 
empowered 
women to face the challenges that are par-
ticular to girls and women of color to create 
something that is greater than any individual 
member. 
We each recognize that we are but one 
small part of a larger whole, but when that 
whole acts as one we are impossible to de-
feat. 
AKA has enriched minds and encouraged 
life-long learning; provided aid for the poor, 
the sick, and underserved; initiated social ac-
tion to advance human and civil rights; worked 
collaboratively with other groups to maximize 
outreach on progressive endeavors; and con-
tinually produced leaders to continue its credo 
of service.

RECOGNIZING THE ROTARY CLUB 
OF BOCA RATON’S OPAL AWARD 
HONOREES LAURA REISS 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the impor-
tant work done by the Rotary Club of Boca 
Raton and to congratulate a recipient of their 
Outstanding People and Leaders (OPAL) 
awards, Laura Reiss. 
Laura has always believed in a world where 
people celebrate and support each other. In 
2008, she harnessed this belief and started a 
free after-school Kindness program at Sunrise 
Park Elementary in Boca Raton, FL where her 
children were going to school. This kindness 
movement that began as a single club be-
came The Kindness Matters 365 Foundation, 
a not-for-profit organization that educates chil-
dren about the importance of being kind to 
themselves and to others, and contributing to 
society so they can make a positive impact in 
their communities and the world. 
The Foundation has spread to nine states, 
with more than 500 ambassadors and 4,000 
members in 90 chapters. As part of their serv-
ice-learning based and community service 
projects, these clubs have collected and dis-
tributed over $1,347,300 in goods, supported 
45,900 individuals, raised $2.5 million in dis-
aster relief, and reported over 613,213 com-
munity service hours. 
Through her philanthropy, service, and self-
less sacrifices, Laura Reiss has touched 
countless lives and made a lasting impact on 
our South Florida community. The work she 
does and the time she has put in is truly de-
serving of this award. 
I extend my most sincere congratulations to 
Laura and to all of tonight’s honorees. As we 
begin this new year, I am confident that the 
Rotary Club of Boca Raton will continue to be 
a cherished institution in South Florida that 
betters our community. I greatly appreciate the 
Club’s work and am pleased to honor their 
OPAL and Lifetime Legacy Award honorees.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize an exemplary Detroit community ac-
tivist and human rights champion, Maureen 
Taylor. 
As Chair for the Michigan Welfare Rights

sity in 1994 with a Master’s in Social Work. 
Shortly after graduating, Maureen began her 
fight for social and economic justice for fami-
lies experiencing economic hardship across 
the State of Michigan. Whether fighting water- 
shutoffs or working toward food security, 
Maureen has never shied away from standing 
up to corporations, elected officials, or others 
to ensure that our families have access to 
their basic needs. She has been instrumental 
in facilitating workshops and trainings with the 
Michigan Department of Health and Human 
Services to ensure that residents have access 
to public services and benefits, as well as pro-
tections against harmful policies. 
Maureen is a dedicated and courageous ad-
vocate and organizer whose passion and work 
is truly commendable and greatly appreciated. 
She has been recognized and honored as the 
first recipient of the Angelo B. Henderson 
Community Commitment Award, as well as 
countless of other awards for championing the 
rights of economically disadvantaged families. 
Maureen Taylor embodies the meaning of so-
cial change and lives it through her daily work. 
Please join me in recognizing Maureen Tay-
lor’s outstanding contributions to the great

TRIBUTE TO HAMILTON COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER 
STEVEN 
DILLINGER 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the career and achieve-
ments of Hamilton County Commissioner Ste-
ven Dillinger. A longtime dedicated public 
servant, Steve has had a significant impact on 
the City of Noblesville and entirety of Hamilton 
County, and Central Indiana. Having served 
as a Hamilton County Commissioner for over 
30 years, he has amassed a record of service 
to his county that will have a positive impact 
for decades to come. 
A graduate of Noblesville High School, 
where he was a star athlete in football, bas-
ketball, baseball, and track for the Millers, 
Steve has continued to promote the lessons of 
teamwork, planning, and preparation that ath-
letics helped instill in him at a young age. In 
his roles as the President of the Executive 
Board of the Noblesville Elementary Football 
League since 1990, and former longtime 
Coach of the Noblesville Grinders football 
team, Steve helped shape many generations 
of Hamilton County youth through participation 
in football. 
Steve has been tuned in to the needs of his 
fellow citizens for many decades. His first 
elected office was a seat on the Noblesville 
City Council from 1980 to 1984. He subse-
quently served on the Noblesville Plan Com-
mission in 1981. Steve is also an exemplary 
leader in the Hamilton County Republican 
Party, serving as a Precinct Committeeman 
from 1986 to the present. 
In 1985, Steve was elected to the Hamilton 
County Council, serving as the governing 
body’s President in 1988. After his time on the 
Hamilton County Council, Steve was elected 
to a seat as one of three Hamilton County 
Commissioners in 1989, representing the cit-
ies of Fishers and Noblesville as well as both 
Delaware and Noblesville Townships. Having 
found a true passion and adeptness for serv-
ing the constituents of Hamilton County, Steve 
has been continually victorious in both primary 
and general elections for one of the Hamilton 
County Commissioner seats for over thirty 
years. During nine of his thirty years, he has 
served as the President of the Hamilton Coun-
ty Board of Commissioners. 
Throughout his time as a Commissioner, 
Hamilton 
County 
has 
undergone 
vast 
changes. The population has exploded over 
400 percent, from 82,000 citizens in the 
1980’s to a population of over 300,000 citizens 
in 2020. Steve has been an integral part of the 
planning of the county, having been involved 
in county-wide zoning updates that paved the 
way for massive growth within Hamilton Coun-
ty. Along with fellow Hamilton County leaders, 
Steve was a vital part of county initiatives that 
helped to foster increased development on 
146th Street and 236th Street, transforming 
them into the major thoroughfares they are 
today. Steve was also deeply involved in the 
development and funding for the State Road 
37 Thoroughfare Plan, and the effort to pave 
over 800 miles of roads in Hamilton County. 
During his time of service, the Hamilton 
County Board of Commissioners has overseen 
the construction of many new buildings for 
various county services including the Hamilton 
County Judicial & Government Center, the 
Hamilton County Highway Department, the 
Hamilton County Corrections Facility, the 
Hamilton County Health Department, and the 
new Humane Society facility. Steve was also 
involved in the major additions that have been 
made to the county-owned Riverview Health 
Hospital, including the new campus in West-
field. 
Throughout his tenure, Steve has also been 
involved in many of the county’s quality of life 
initiatives including the effort to locate an Ivy 
Tech 
Community 
College 
Campus 
in 
Noblesville, as well as adding 1,000 acres of 
land to the Hamilton County Parks. Steve’s 
service to the county includes service on the 
Hamilton County Plan Commission, the Ham-
ilton County Drainage Board, the Hamilton 
County Board of Finance, and the Hamilton 
County Solid Waste Board. Noting his many 
years of service to community, Steve was cho-
sen in 2000 to be the Hamilton County ap-
pointee to the Indianapolis Airport Authority 
Board. During his time on the board, a new 
national 
award-winning 
Indianapolis 
Inter-
national Airport was built, and has been voted 
the Best Airport in North America year after 
year. 
With a public service career that has 
stretched over four decades, during a time of 
great progress for Hamilton County, it’s no 
surprise that Steve was honored by the Indi-
ana Association of County Commissioners as 
the Outstanding County Commissioner of 
2019. In addition to this honor Steve has on 
five occasions been honored by the Indiana 
Association of Counties with their Outstanding 
County Achievement Award. Three times he 
received the organization’s Government Co-
operation Achievement Award. As the longest 
current serving County Commissioner in the 
State of Indiana his track record of unparal-
leled service to the citizens of Hamilton Coun-
ty speaks for itself. 
During my time in Congress, I have had the 
pleasure of working with many capable and 
dedicated community leaders, however very 
few community leaders have given more of 
their time and talent to their communities than 
my friend Steve. His decades of leadership 
are a testament to his desire to create a better 
community for his fellow citizens. It is with 
great honor that I commend my friend on his 
amazing career and all the important work he 
has done and will continue to do on behalf of 
the citizens of Hamilton County.

tant work done by the Rotary Club of Boca 
Raton and to congratulate a recipient of their 
Outstanding People and Leaders (OPAL) 
awards, Jerry Kramer. 
Jerry has lived a life of service to his coun-

him to build and donate a 20,000 square foot 
facility for the Association for Children with 
Learning Disabilities. Currently, Jerry makes 
substantial donations to local and national 
non-profit organizations each year. 
Through his philanthropy and service, Jerry 
Kramer has touched countless lives and made

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
SGT. DARON WYATT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the robust career and retirement of 
Sergeant Daron Wyatt. Sgt. Wyatt served over 
33 years in law enforcement, the last 111⁄2 
with the Anaheim PD. 
In 1986, Sgt. Wyatt began his public service 
career with the Tustin PD. After a successful 
tenure with the Tustin PD, Sgt. Wyatt contin-
ued his career working for the Santa Ana Uni-
fied School District PD, Imperial PD, Placentia 
PD, and later Anaheim PD. 
While working for the Placentia PD in 1997, 
Sgt. Wyatt was assigned the Cathy Torrez 
Homicide Cold Case in 1994. Sgt. Wyatt 
worked the case for 10 years before con-
vincing the DA’s Office to prosecute. The case 
had been rejected by three different prosecu-
tors and a memo from the Orange County 
Sheriffs Office opined the case would never 
be solved. The suspects were convicted in 
2015. 
In 2011, Sgt. Wyatt was assigned as the 
lead detective on the Orange County Home-
less Homicides Investigative Task Force. He 
obtained confessions from Itzcoatl Ocampo to

From 2015 to 2019, Sgt. Wyatt served as 
the Public Information Officer for the Anaheim 
PD and Anaheim Fire & Rescue, he rep-
resented the departments in local, national, 
and international news stories for such inci-
dents as the KKK stabbings, the Donald 
Trump presidential campaign visit, multiple of-
ficer involved shootings, and the Canyon 
Fires. 
Sgt. Wyatt was also deployed as a PIO on 
Type 1 Incident Management Teams to the 
Mendocino Complex (largest wildfire in CA 
history) and the Camp Fire (most destructive 
wildfire in CA history). He is one of 70 FEMA 
credentialed Master Public Information Officers

HONORING RORY GAMBLE—FIRST 
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT 
OF 
UNITED 
AUTO 
WORKERS 
UNION 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments and leader-
ship of Rory Gamble, the first African Amer-
ican president of the United Auto Workers 
Union. 
Mr. Gamble’s journey to president of one of 
the largest labor unions in North America is 
the embodiment of the American success 
story. Rory Gamble started his career as a 
welder fixture repairman for the Ford Motor 
Company in 1974. He immediately became an 
active member of the United Auto Workers 
Local 600 union. Over the years he took on 
assignments and increasing responsibility, 
holding several different positions in the union. 
His assignments have included local union 
health and safety coordinator, employee sup-
port services program, education director, civil 
rights coordinator, fitness center coordinator, 
family services and learning center coordi-
nator, director of Local 600 Ford units, and re-
tiree benefits liaison. More importantly he has 
advocated for union workers’ pay and benefits, 
having served on two previous negotiating 
teams in 1998 and 2003. There is no doubt 
his hard work has led to his being appointed 
to the vital role of president of the UAW in 
2019. 
Beyond his work for better wages and work-
ing conditions for laborers, Mr. Gamble gives 
his time as a volunteer with a number of com-
munity 
and 
charitable 
organizations. 
He 
serves as a board member of Bridging Com-
munities, a grassroots organization dedicated 
to improving life for elders in Southwest De-
troit. He is also co-chair of the Michigan Labor 
History Society, treasurer of the Rouge Em-
ployees Credit Union and a lifetime supporter 
of Southwest Detroit Little League. Mr. Gam-
ble’s efforts have been recognized numerous 
times, including by the City of Detroit. 
Please join me in recognizing Rory Gam-
ble’s outstanding contributions.

CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CITY OF COM-
MERCE 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 60th anniversary of 
the City of Commerce, which I have the honor 
of representing as part of my 40th Congres-
sional District. 
The City of Commerce was incorporated on 
January 28, 1960, because area residents 
were finding it difficult to obtain basic govern-
ment services such as garbage pickup, recre-
ation facilities, and infrastructure development. 
By the start of 1962, a Los Angeles Times ar-
ticle about Commerce reported that ‘‘In little 
more than two years, the city has made re-
markable strides.’’ Over the years, Commerce 
has continued to evolve into a local economic 
leader, a popular destination for shoppers, 
businesses, and prospective residents, and a 
community known throughout America as the 
‘‘Model City.’’ 
Even before its official incorporation, the 
area that eventually became the City of Com-
merce housed various manufacturing busi-
nesses. As the city grew, the need to create 
and maintain its infrastructure became crucial. 
In 1962, the Commerce City Council approved 
$1.5 million to construct streets, which in-
creased connectivity to neighboring cities and 
the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
With Commerce’s location by two of Los An-
geles County’s major transit corridors—the I– 
710 and I–5 freeways—products from around 
the world are transported through the city 
every day, and building and maintaining city 
roads remains one of Commerce’s main prior-
ities. 
Commerce’s rich transportation legacy ex-
tends to other matters as well. In 1963, Com-
merce became the first city in the United 
States to offer regularly scheduled, free bus 
service to its residents. Commerce buses 
were also the first in California to be equipped 
with two-way radios. 
Today, Commerce’s bus system remains 
free to residents and connects to other munic-
ipal bus lines, MetroLink (the region’s commu-
nity rail service), and the emerging network of 
light and heavy rail lines of the Los Angeles 
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
Currently, Commerce buses operate on 100% 
Clean Natural Gas. Eventually, like other sys-
tems in California, they will be 100% electric 
and/or hybrid. 
The Model City also prides itself on its other 
services, including four libraries, scholarships 
for college-bound residents, a Community Job 
Fair, lunches for children during the summer, 
and an annual book festival and comic book 
convention. 
Early in its history, the city also built four 
neighborhood parks that have included base-
ball 
fields, 
basketball 
courts, 
and 
the 
Aquatorium, which has been the home of 
world-class Olympic swimmers and water polo 
players, including Olympic gold medalist Bren-
da Villa. 
Commerce is home to commercial icons in-
cluding the Citadel Outlets, whose historic fa-
cade is modeled after an Assyrian castle. 
Every year, the Citadel brings in millions of 
visitors from around the world to shop and 
dine. 
The city also boasts the Commerce Casino 
and Hotel. The casino is the world’s largest 
card club, and has donated $50,000 in schol-
arship money each year for the past thirty 
years to help students pursue their college 
educations. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please join me in celebrating Commerce’s 
60th anniversary, and wishing the city resi-
dents and leaders many more years of suc-
cess in the Model City.

HONOREES 
SUE 
AND 
YAACOV 
HELLER 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the impor-
tant work done by the Rotary Club of Boca 
Raton and to congratulate two recipients of 
their Outstanding People and Leaders (OPAL) 
awards, Sue and Yaacov Heller. 
For the Hellers, life individually and as a 
couple has involved giving back and creating 
awareness through the arts and education. 
Yaacov has been rated among the world’s 
most accomplished sculptors and top silver-
smiths. His work has been used to convey 
messages of hope, tolerance, acceptance, re-
membrance and peace through interpretation 
of the human form and spirit while holding to 
his personal unswerving commitment to artistic 
quality. 
Sue Heller is a retired art educator with 
more than 30 years of experience. Her em-
phasis has always been ‘‘speaking through the 
arts.’’ She feels that students with special 
needs and adults in crisis who might not oth-
erwise be able to learn or express themselves 
can find a way to ‘‘converse’’ through the cre-
ative process. This belief has always been 
motivation for professional and volunteer work. 
Through their philanthropy and service, the 
Hellers have touched countless lives and 
made a lasting impact on our South Florida 
community. The work they do and the time 
they have put in is truly deserving of this 
award. 
I extend my most sincere congratulations to 
the Hellers and to all of tonight’s honorees. As 
we begin this new year, I am confident that 
the Rotary Club of Boca Raton will continue to 
be a cherished institution in South Florida that 
betters our community. I greatly appreciate the 
Club’s work and am pleased to honor their 
OPAL and Lifetime Legacy Award honorees.

Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, Jake 
and Angie Moore of Yakima have always had 
a passion for children, especially those with 
special needs and those who are trauma af-
fected. 
Angie is a speech paraprofessional for 5th 
and 6th graders, and Jake is a paraprofes-
sional in a high school special ed classroom. 
On their first wedding anniversary, they 
were told that it would be a miracle if they 
ever became pregnant. IVF wasn’t an option 
for them due to the cost, and after giving it a 
lot of prayer and thought, they decided to 
move forward with foster care. They felt this 
was God’s timing. 
They have since opened their hearts and 
their home to become the loving parents of 
multiple children from the Yakima Valley. 
Though they have faced many struggles with 
the hardship of the foster care system, they 
continue to move forward and stay positive, fi-
nalizing the adoption of their daughter and 
welcoming a 2-year-old foster son at the end 
of 2019. 
They are excited to continue to take in more 
children as the years go on, so they can be 
the voice and advocate that many of them do 
not have. 
They have two household rules with all of 
the children they take in: 1. They will all be 
there to stay unless somebody else says oth-
erwise. 2. Each child will be loved and cher-
ished as their own, no matter how long they 
are in the Moore’s home. 
Jake and Angie are an inspiration to parents 
across the country and in Central Washington. 
They are truly Angels in Adoption.

TRIBUTE TO JUDGE RAY 
OLIVARRI 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of Judge Ray Olivarri who 
passed away on January 15, 2020 at the age 
of 64. A community leader and lifelong public 
servant, Judge Olivarri hails from my home-
town of San Antonio, Texas. He is survived by 
his wife, Brenda Olivarri; two children, Lauren 
and Jeffrey Olivarri; and grandson Jeffrey 
Olivarri, Jr. He will be greatly missed. 
Judge Ray Olivarri was born and raised in 
San Antonio, Texas. Upon graduating from Lu-
ther Burbank High School, he went on to be-
come a probation officer with Bexar County 
and served on the City of San Antonio Zoning 
Commission. Later, he went on to pursue a 
law degree from Texas Southern University in 
Houston. 
After practicing as a criminal defense law-
yer, Olivarri was elected to serve in 2006 as 
judge for Bexar County Court at Law No. 6. In 
2012, he was elected to serve on the 399th 
State District Court for four years. Eventually, 
his journey led him to serve as state judge for 
the 144th District Court upon his election win 
in 2018. Judge Olivarri served on the 144th 
before illness compelled him to step down. 
Olivarri was a person of high caliber whose 
kindness was only matched by his dedication 
to his family and career. Olivarri was a com-
passionate 
justice, 
sensitive 
to 
the 
vulnerabilities of those who came before him. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have known 
such a remarkable individual who defined 
what it means to live in the service of others. 
The entire San Antonio community mourns 
this tremendous loss. I know his legacy and 
memory will live on in every single life he 
changed. Judge, thank you for your many 
years of public service and commitment to our 
community.

COMMEMORATING ‘‘BLACK 
JANUARY’’ 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 
‘‘Black January’’ killings which is one of the 
most tragic events in Azerbaijan’s history. 
On the night of January 20, 1990, approxi-
mately 26,000 Soviet troops stormed Azer-
baijan’s capital city of Baku in tanks and ar-
mored vehicles. That night, the Soviet military 
bulldozed innocent Azerbaijanis and opened 
fire indiscriminately on peaceful demonstra-
tors, including women and children. As a re-
sult of these merciless acts 147 people were 
killed, around 800 were injured, 841 were ar-
rested, and 5 went missing. 
The Human Rights Watch report ‘‘Black 
January in Azerbaijan’’ states that ‘‘among the 
most heinous violations of human rights during 
the Baku incursion were the numerous attacks 
on medical personnel, ambulances, and even 
hospitals.’’ The report concludes that the vio-
lence used by the Soviet Army constituted an 
exercise in collective punishment and that the 
punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet sol-
diers may have been intended as a warning to 
nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in 
other Republics of the Soviet Union. I offer my 
thoughts and prayers to the families of those 
who gave their lives for the independence of 
Azerbaijan. 
The United States was one of the first coun-
tries to recognize independence and fully es-
tablished diplomatic relations on February 28, 
1992 and the relationship between our two 
countries endures to this day. The United 
States and Azerbaijan are strategic allies and 
share common interests in the region and 
globally. 
As the co-chairman of the Congressional 
Azerbaijan Caucus, I urge my colleagues to 
recognize the sacrifices of the Azerbaijani 
people in their steps toward a free market 
economy and encourage a recommitment to 
the 
democratic 
values 
for 
which 
many 
Azerbaijanis sacrificed their lives. 
RECOGNIZING THE ROTARY CLUB 
OF BOCA RATON’S OPAL AWARD 
HONOREES 
DORIS 
AND 
NEIL 
GILLMAN 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the impor-
tant work done by the Rotary Club of Boca 
Raton and to congratulate two recipients of 
their Outstanding People and Leaders (OPAL) 
awards, Doris and Neil Gillman. 
When it comes to strengthening their com-
munities, the Gillmans strongly believe that 
enduring support begins with not with a check, 
but with a relationship. The couple has 
partnered with dozens of charities in Boca 
Raton and Pittsburgh and have built their vol-
unteerism and philanthropy around being 
deeply engaged in the organizations to which 
they commit. 
The impact of the Gillmans’ connections to 
causes, particularly those that serve children, 
veterans, and animals, can be found through-
out the city. They’ve worked closely with Flor-
ence Fuller Child Development Centers to 
construct much-needed new facilities, with the 
Caridad Center to outfit a new pediatric dental 
surgery room, with Boca Raton Regional Hos-
pital to provide support for new parents in 
need, and with Peggy Adams Animal Rescue 
League to accomplish the vision of their new 
campus. The couple has also served on local 
charitable boards; Doris with Boca Helping 
Hands, and Neil with the Boca West Chil-
dren’s Foundation. In fact, it was BWCF that 
led them to many of the organizations they 
have supported, including their most recent 
focus—Sweet Dream Makers. 
Through their philanthropy and service, the 
Gillmans have touched countless lives and 
made a lasting impact on our South Florida 
community. The work they do and the time 
they have put in is truly deserving of these 
awards. 
I extend my most sincere congratulations to 
the Gillmans and to all of tonight’s honorees. 
As we begin this new year, I am confident that 
the Rotary Club of Boca Raton will continue to 
be a cherished institution in South Florida that 
betters our community. I greatly appreciate the 
Club’s work and am pleased to honor their 
OPAL and Lifetime Legacy Award honorees.

CONGRATULATING 
INDIANA 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BRIAN 
BOSMA ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Indiana Speaker of the 
House Brian Bosma on his retirement and to 
thank him for his many years of dedicated 
service to Hoosiers. 
He was first elected to the Indiana State-
house in 1986 and served as speaker from 
2004 to 2006 and again from 2010 to 2020, 
making him the longest-serving speaker in In-
diana State history. Speaker Bosma has clear-
ly dedicated his life to moving Indiana forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E59 
January 17, 2020 
His commitment to Hoosier common sense 
and his tireless efforts to advance opportuni-
ties for future generations have made our 
state a better place to live and work. 
I am grateful to have served alongside him 
in the Statehouse and to have worked to-
gether to improve the lives of our fellow Hoo-
siers. Speaker Bosma’s strong conservative 
values 
and 
outstanding 
leadership 
have 
helped bring Indiana’s economy and infra-
structure into the 21st century. Thanks to 
Speaker Bosma, Indiana is one of the only 
states in the nation to pass a 20-year, fully- 
funded roads plan to improve state-maintained 
and local roads. Throughout his time as 
speaker, he never stopped fighting for Indiana 
businesses and workers. Speaker Bosma 
helped secure the strong economic climate in 
which Hoosiers are able to start and grow 
businesses, including maintaining a AAA credit 
rating, large budget reserves, and a low un-
employment rate. He is also a fierce defender 
of the unborn and has worked to ensure that 
every human life in our state is treated with 
dignity and respect. 
In addition to the positive impact of his leg-
islative accomplishments, Brian Bosma’s pas-
sion for helping others goes unmatched. His 
family’s impressive work through Bosma In-
dustries for the Blind is a testament to the 
power of one person determined to make a 
difference. Speaker Bosma brought those 
same values with him to the Statehouse each 
and every day. His dedication and passion ex-
emplify the progress our society can make to-
ward greater opportunities and brighter futures 
through innovative thinking and perseverance. 
I have no doubt his legacy will last far into the 
future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking Indiana Speaker of the House 
Brian Bosma for his lifelong commitment to 
serving Indiana communities. On behalf of 2nd 
District Hoosiers, I wish him the best as he 
embarks on this next chapter in life.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
JONATHAN WOLMAN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the memory of Mr. Jonathan 
Wolman, a man who spent forty-six years of 
his life tirelessly dedicated to pursuing the 
truth and reporting on the stories that have 
shaped modern-day America. 
Following in his father’s footsteps, Mr. Jona-
than Wolman began his career in journalism 
as a newsperson for the Associated Press’s 
(AP) Wisconsin bureau in 1973. His talent for 
reading the political currents coursing through 
the hallways of Congress and the state cap-
itals was readily evident to his coworkers and 
readers from the very beginning. Later that 
same year the AP sent him to Detroit for the 
first time, where he would cover the election of 
Coleman Young, the first African American 
mayor in a majority minority city. 
Mr. Wolman also reported about Fannie Lou 
Hamer’s voting rights campaign. Hamer’s ef-
fort led to thousands of African Americans 
gaining the right to vote. His career soon 
brought him to Washington D.C., where he 
would cover events that shook the nation like 
the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster and the 
No Gun Ri massacre, the latter of which would 
go on to earn the AP the Pulitzer Prize for In-
vestigative Reporting in 2000. After a two-year 
stint as senior vice president of the AP, Mr. 
Wolman moved back west in 2004, working 
for the Denver Post for three years until his re-
turn to the Motor City as the editor and pub-
lisher of the Detroit News in 2007. There he 
would spend the rest of his life reporting on 
some of our great city’s most uncertain years, 
asking the tough questions and holding our 
leaders to account until his passing on April 
15, 2019. 
We owe a debt of gratitude for the hard 
work and dedication of Mr. Jonathan Wolman. 
His objectivity and journalistic integrity will be 
forever remembered. It is with great honor that 
I ask you to join me in honor of his memory 
and upon his recognition at Rainbow Push’s 
Let Freedom Ring Awards.

RECOGNIZING THE ROTARY CLUB 
OF BOCA RATON’S OPAL AWARD 
HONOREES 
TOBY 
AND 
LEON 
COOPERMAN 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 17, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today in recognition of the impor-
tant work done by the Rotary Club of Boca 
Raton and to congratulate two recipients of 
their Outstanding People and Leaders (OPAL) 
awards, Toby and Leon Cooperman. 
The Coopermans’ story exemplifies the 
American Dream. As a first generation Amer-
ican and son of a plumber, Leon worked hard 
to receive a quality public education before 
earning his MBA from Columbia University. 
His hard work continued as he entered the 
professional world, leading to a remarkably 
successful career. 
Due to the success achieved through their 
hard work, Toby and Leon feel a moral imper-
ative to give others the opportunity to pursue 
the American Dream that they have enjoyed. 
This led them to take The Giving Pledge, a 
commitment to give the majority of their wealth 
to address societies most pressing needs. 
Through their philanthropy and service, the 
Coopermans have touched countless lives and 
made a lasting impact on our South Florida 
community. The work they do and the time 
they have put in is truly deserving of these 
awards. 
I extend my most sincere congratulations to 
the Coopermans and to all of tonight’s hon-
orees. As we begin this new year, I am con-
fident that the Rotary Club of Boca Raton will 
continue to be a cherished institution in South 
Florida that betters our community. I greatly 
appreciate the Club’s work and am pleased to 
honor their OPAL and Lifetime Legacy Award 
honorees.
