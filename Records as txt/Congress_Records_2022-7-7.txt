DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 7, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable KWEISI 
MFUME to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
Dr. Lee Corder, Arlington, Virginia, 
offered the following prayer: 
Lord, as we gather today, we pray for 
our Nation, for unity and peace. May 
we reflect on some of the painful les-
sons learned in times of suffering and 
strife. 
Lord, convict us when we divide our-
selves into tribes rather than seek to 
live as a united people and are sur-
prised by our lack of unity. 
Lord, correct our arrogance and 
teach us humility when we are tempted 
to assume that those with whom we 
disagree have nothing to offer us. 
Gracious Father, forgive us when we 
tolerate or contribute to the language 
of 
destruction 
and 
hate 
and 
are 
shocked by acts of violence. 
Instead, imprint upon all who serve 
here the transforming truth that ‘‘we 
love because He first loved us . . . 
therefore, since God so loved us, we 
also are to love one another.’’ For You 
tell us that apart from love, kindness, 
and mutual respect, we will accomplish 
little of lasting impact. 
In the name of the Lord we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING BOB PESTONI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Bob 
Pestoni, a third generation Napa Valley native 
son. 
Born in 1937, Mr. Pestoni was raised by his 
parents, Henry and Lena Pestoni, on the 
Pestoni family ranch in St. Helena. He was 
from two pioneering winemaking families, the 
Pestoni family, originally from Monte Carasso, 
Switzerland, and the Domingos family from St. 
George Island in the Azores. 
From a young age, Mr. Pestoni had a great 
love for sports. He participated in Carpy Gang 
Football as well as played football and ran 
track at St. Helena High School and Napa Val-
ley College. When he served our country in 
the Army, he also joined the Army football and 
wrestling teams. 
Mr. Pestoni was an innovative leader in the 
waste and recycling industry. In 1963, he and 
his brother Marvin created Upper Valley Dis-
posal Service, becoming the refuse hauler for 
the upper Napa Valley. Over time, it grew into 
a fully integrated company specializing in recy-
cling, composting, waste collection and dis-
posal, and renewable energy production. His 
work creating a system for processing wine 
grape pomace into certified organic compost 
won him recognition from National Geo-
graphic, Organic Materials Research Institute, 
and the state of California. Mr. Pestoni also 
received the prestigious John P. Moscone 
Award his for long-term exemplary commit-
ment, dedication, and service to the waste in-
dustry. 
In admiration for his family business and 
heritage, Mr. Pestoni and his wife Silvia, 
opened Rutherford Grove Winery in 1994 and 
resumed making the single vineyard, hand- 
crafted artisanal wines Bob’s father and grand-
father had created for more than a century be-
fore him. In 2017, in celebration of their 125th 
anniversary of Napa Valley winemaking, the 
winery was renamed Pestoni Family Estate 
Winery. 
Mr. Pestoni was known for his warmth, gen-
erosity, and infectious smile as well as his 
genuine love of people and life. Mr. Pestoni 
was well loved by his wife of 59 years, Sylvia; 
his four children Andy, Greg (Aimee), Christy 
(Eric), and Jon (Wendy); six grandchildren 
Rico, Matteo, Lucia, Dominic, Ennio and 
Massimo; his brother Marvin (Charlene); and 
his best friend since the second grade, 
George Steinauer. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Bob 
Pestoni was a pioneer and visionary in the 
waste industry who also made a lasting impact 
on his family, friends, and his community. 
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today. 
CONGRATULATING 
THE 
QUEENSBURY GIRLS’ LACROSSE 
TEAM ON THEIR 2022 SEASON 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Queensbury girls’ la-
crosse team on their exceptional run to the 
New York Class B State finals and to recog-
nize their incredible thirty-one game winning 
streak. 
The Spartans have dominated over the past 
two seasons. They went undefeated in the 
2021 season and had another flawless record 
in the 2022 regular season. While the state 
finals were unfortunately canceled due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic last year, Queensbury 
was able to compete for the Class B cham-
pionship this season. Queensbury was the first 
team from section II to compete for this title in 
over a decade, and this was the first state 
finals appearance ever for the school. 
The road to the championship game for the 
Spartans was full of adversity, determination, 
and hard work. The Spartans were pushed to 
overtime in their semifinal game against 
Westhampton Beach when eighth grader Kady 
Duffy delivered the game-winning goal to de-
feat Westhampton nine to eight. Queensbury 
then went on to meet Victor for the Class B 
state championship. In this game, the Spar-
tans got off to a rocky start and went into the 
half down ten to three. The team showed 
great resilience by coming back in the second 
half and holding Victor scoreless for ten min-
utes. However, the Spartans were ultimately 
unable to secure the title and eventually fell 
fourteen to five. Regardless of the outcome of 
this game, the Queensbury team showed in-
credible tenacity and foreshadowed what is 
possible for the program moving forward. 
On behalf of the 21st District of New York, 
it is my honor to recognize the Queensbury 
girls’ lacrosse team and congratulate them on 
their exceptional two-year run. We are very 
proud of their tremendous work and cannot 
wait to see all they accomplish in the years to 
come.

WE THE FUTURE WINNERS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the achievement of two 
students from Texas’ 24th District. Yashica 
Nabar and Dawson Rhodes were selected to 
receive the Constituting America’s Best High 
School Short Film Award and the Best Middle 
School Song Award, respectfully. 
Each year, Constituting America—a non- 
profit, non-partisan organization that educates 
and informs students about the U.S. Constitu-
tion—sponsors the ‘‘We The Future’’ Contest. 
Students across the country submit songs, 
short films, PSA’s, essays, STEM and mar-
keting projects showcasing the U.S. Constitu-
tion. 
Yashica and Dawson were selected along 
with just 39 other students nationwide. These 
students’ achievements have not only made 
our entire community proud, but also exempli-
fied the creativity harbored in North Texas. I 
thank Yashica and Dawson for their hard work 
and passion. They both have a bright future 
ahead.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF JACOB 
CHAFFINS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to one of Eastern 
Kentucky’s 
fallen 
heroes, 
Jacob 
Russell 
Chaffins, a 28-year-old law enforcement officer 
and certified canine handler who was one of 
three officers killed in the line of duty in Allen, 
Kentucky. 
Chaffins’ life should not be measured by his 
number of years on Earth, but by the mag-
nitude of his service and courageous action 
during his short lifetime. He not only earned 
Badge No. 533 from the Prestonsburg Police 
Department, but he was also a member of the 
Prestonsburg Fire Department, a certified 
EMT, and a U.S. Marshal. Chaffins was also 
enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces, serving as 
a Combat Engineer Sergeant in the Kentucky 
Army National Guard’s 577th Sapper Com-
pany in Prestonsburg, Kentucky. As a guards-
man, Sgt. Chaffins was deployed during mul-
tiple state emergencies, including the Winter 
Storm Response of February 2015 and 
COVID–19 pandemic relief efforts in March 
2020, dedicating countless hours to serve and 
protect the people of the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky. Sgt. Chaffins was awarded the 
Army Service Ribbon, the Army Reserve Com-
ponent Achievement Medal, and the Florida 
Commendation Medal for meritorious achieve-
ment in Exportable Combat Training Capa-
bility. Sgt. Chaffins was also awarded the 
Army Achievement Medal in recognition of his 
excellence as a team leader in preparing and 
equipping troops to defend this great Nation 
and the values we hold dear. 
President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a 
former commissioner of the New York City Po-
lice Department once said, ‘‘No man is worth 
his salt, who is not ready at all times to risk 
his body, to risk his well-being, to risk his life 
in a great cause.’’ On Friday, July 1, 2022, Of-
ficer Chaffins paid the ultimate sacrifice after 
he valiantly risked his life and answered the 
call of duty to protect others in Floyd County. 
His heroic death was the greatest display of 
love described in John 15:13, ‘‘Greater love

has no man than this: to lay down his life for 
his friends.’’ It was with great courage of con-
viction that Jacob Chaffins lived to protect the 
people of the United States, the Common-
wealth of Kentucky, and especially those in 
Floyd County. 
In a Nation where police forces have been 
vilified in recent years by the actions of a few 
bad actors, may Officer Chaffins’ life be a re-
minder of the outstanding integrity and sac-
rifice that the thin blue line represents. We 
must continue to support our law enforcement 
officers across the United States, ensuring 
they are fully equipped, adequately prepared, 
and never at the mercy of evildoers. 
This Nation owes a great debt of gratitude 
for the life and service of Officer Jacob 
Chaffins. Our thoughts and prayers are with 
his wife Savannah, their daughter Paisley, his 
mother April and his siblings, as well as the 
widespread band of brothers and sisters in 
uniform who served alongside him. May his 
loved ones find peace and confidence in 
God’s promise in Matthew 5:9, ‘‘Blessed are 
the peacemakers, for they will be called chil-
dren of God.’’

HONORING 
STUART 
SMITH, 
CHARLES 
SMITH, 
AND 
THE 
SMITH-MADRONE WINERY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Stuart Smith 
and Charles Smith, founders of the Smith- 
Madrone Vineyards & Winery in celebration of 
the winery’s 50th anniversary. 
The Smith-Madrone Winery was founded on 
May 14, 1971. Its vineyards are located on top 
of Spring Mountain in Napa Valley at 1,200 to 
1,300 feet in elevation. The winery only pro-
duces wine from these 50-year-old local vine-
yards that are enriched by the county’s deep 
red Aiken loam soil. 
Smith-Madrone Winery played an integral 
role in the international popularization of Napa 
Valley wines. The winery first prompted inter-
national recognition when its 1977 Riesling 
was named the world’s Best Riesling by wine 
experts in the first international Wine Olympics 
in Paris in 1979. Additionally, Smith-Madrone 
received The Daily Meal’s Winery of the Year 
award in 2014. In 2020, the winery was cho-
sen by the University of California, Berkeley to 
conduct a virtual wine tasting to attendees of 
the University’s homecoming events. 
Stuart and Charles have positively impacted 
the wine community through their involvement 
in the Napa Valley wine community. Stuart 
was appointed to the 2008 General Plan 
Steering Committee and the 1998 Napa River 
Watershed Task Force by the Napa County 
Board of Supervisors. Starting in 2006, 
Charles has published weekly harvest report 
for the St. Helena Star, until Stuart took over 
writing the report column in 2012. Stuart also 
served as chairman of the 1986 and 2005 
Napa Valley Wine Auction. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Stuart 
Smith and Charles Smith, through the Smith- 
Madrone Winery and their community involve-
ment, have made important contributions to 
the Napa Valley wine community. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor them here 
today.

HONORING MONSIGNOR ARTURO 
JOSE´ BAN˜ UELAS’ RETIREMENT 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Monsignor Arturo Jose´ 
Ban˜uelas’ life work in the Catholic Church as 
he retires from full-time ministry. 
Monsignor Ban˜uelas is a native of El Paso, 
TX and Pecos, AZ. His 46 years of service 
have truly been centered in assisting the com-
munity’s sick, hungry, and unemployed. During 
his tenure as pastor at Saint Pius X Church, 
the parish has received national distinction as 
one of the best parishes in America. He also 
significantly grew the parish’s ministries and 
outreach programs in Saint Mark and assisted 
in the development of the new San Pedro de 
Jesus 
Maldonado 
Church. 
Monsignor 
Ban˜uelas’ pastoral leadership has taken him 
execute missionary initiatives in Chihuahua, 
Mexico, Honduras, China, Cuba, and Kenya. 
He is a venerated faith leader always work-
ing for the betterment of his community. He 
founded numerous theological initiatives such 
as the Tepeyac Institute, a diocesan ministry 
formation center, the Academy of Catholic His-
panic Theologians of the United States and 
the El Paso Interfaith Alliance. His work is also 
grounded in social justice to advocate for the 
neediest. He founded the Hope Border Insti-
tute—a pillar in the El Paso and Ciudad 
Juarez region for the immigrant rights move-
ment. 
Monsignor Ban˜uelas is the embodiment of a 
community leader devoted to the service to 
the people of El Paso. May he continue to live 
out his commitment to his faith and community 
in retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. JOHN W. RYAN 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr. John 
W. Ryan, president and CEO of the Con-
ference of State Bank Supervisors, who unex-
pectedly passed away on May 16, 2022. 
John was a steadfast advocate of state fi-
nancial supervision as the leader of CSBS, the 
nationwide organization of financial regulators 
from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 
U.S. territories, for 11 years. 
But John was more than just an advocate 
and leader. He was a rare consensus builder 
in Washington. While he fiercely defended the 
dual banking system, he tempered his passion 
with humility, humor, and integrity. As tributes 
have poured in from across the nation, it is 
clear that he touched many with his humility, 
kindness, and vast knowledge of financial reg-
ulation. 
John was also a visionary. In recent years, 
he crafted strategies that empowered states to 
retain their authority and function on a local 
level while working together with federal regu-
lators as one system; he called this strategy 
‘‘networked supervision.’’ 
John grew up in a banking family. He would 
recount summers spent working for his father, 
who ran the Bank of Walnut Creek in Northern 
California. Among his many early jobs, he 
often told of filing checks, and when he was 
old enough, driving them over the Golden 
Gate Bridge to the San Francisco Federal Re-
serve Bank. His early experience with the pay-
ments system informed his career and helped 
shape his idea for a more seamless system. 
After graduating from the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley with a degree in political 
science and economics, John moved to Wash-
ington, D.C., where he worked on the House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Com-
mittee, now the House Committee on Finan-
cial Services. While there, he worked on 
groundbreaking legislation, including the 1994 
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching 
Efficiency Act. He later took a fellowship with 
the financial services commission in Brussels 
and worked for a public policy consulting firm. 
In 1997, John joined CSBS as an assistant 
vice president of legislative affairs. He rose 
through the ranks to become President and 
Chief Executive Officer in 2011. Throughout 
his career, John helped define the contribu-
tions and accountabilities of state financial 
regulators. He was a key contributor to pro-
tecting the states’ role in financial services leg-
islation, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 
the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act and the Secure and Fair 
Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act. John 
also played a critical role in the creation of 
what is now the Nationwide Multistate Licens-
ing System. 
After the financial crisis of 2008, John rec-
ognized the need for policymakers to have 
facts and figures about community banking 
when writing legislation that would impact 
them. He was instrumental in creating the 
Community Bank Research Conference with 
the Federal Reserve Board. The conference’s 
research has driven more sound and appro-
priate regulatory policy and supervision, and, I 
believe, helped policymakers recognize the 
value of community banking when crafting 
laws and rules during the pandemic. 
Under John’s leadership, CSBS was a val-
ued partner to Congress as we worked 
through a range of financial services issues. 
The impact of his vision and leadership is im-
mense. Our financial system is better because 
of John W. Ryan’s work, as are the lives of 
those of us whom he touched.

HONORING CURT MORGAN 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Curt Morgan, who is concluding his 
nearly six-year service as Chief Executive Offi-
cer of Vistra Corp., one of the nation’s largest 
integrated retail electricity and power genera-
tion companies, which is headquartered in the 
24th District of Texas.

When Curt took over Vistra, the company 
operated exclusively in Texas. Today, its oper-
ations span more than 20 states, and its busi-
nesses serve more than 4.25 million cus-
tomers. 
Throughout its rapid growth, Curt ensured 
the company took proactive steps to create a 
culture of inclusion, improve its spending with 
diverse-owned enterprises, and be a company 
that does business the right way. 
Curt has always believed that electricity is 
the lifeblood of our society, and access to reli-
able electricity is a fundamental necessity of 
life. To prepare Vistra for the future, he has 
spearheaded the transformation of the com-
pany’s fleet to meet the challenges of pro-
ducing reliable, affordable electricity in a rap-
idly changing world. 
The Vistra Zero initiative is a years-long 
commitment to powering America’s zero-car-
bon, clean energy future. Under this plan, 
Vistra has already built the world’s largest bat-
tery energy storage facility, reduced its com-
pany’s carbon footprint, and initiated or com-
pleted over a dozen solar and energy storage 
facilities. 
A native of Galesburg, Illinois, Curt never 
forgot the impact power plants have histori-
cally played in their host communities. He has 
ensured an orderly and responsible retirement 
process that treated workers and the local 
community with dignity and respect. Through 
his advocacy, Illinois lawmakers passed the 
Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative, 
which will transform nine retiring coal-fired 
plant sites into renewable energy centers. 
Because of Curt’s vision, business acumen, 
and leadership, for years to come, thousands 
of hardworking men and women in our na-
tion’s building trades and energy industry will 
safely operate power plants, install miles and 
miles of solar panels, configure hundreds of 
thousands of battery modules, responsibly re-
tire legacy plants, and reclaim thousands of 
acres at retired plant sites. 
Despite all the regulatory, environmental, 
and economic changes, including the unprece-
dented impact of a global pandemic and 
weather events, thanks to Curt’s management 
Vistra’s future is as bright as ever. I want to 
express my appreciation and best wishes to 
Curt, and I hope that he will continue to guide 
America’s energy transition in his next profes-
sional chapter and wish he and his family well.

HONORING AL WAGNER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Al Wagner who 
is Napa County Farm Bureau’s 2022 Agri-
culturist of the Year. 
Born in Queens, New York, and raised in 
Connecticut, Mr. Wagner grew up helping his 
grandparents on their family farm. He attended 
both the Universal Technical Institute for 
Automotives and Diesel Mechanics in Phoe-
nix, Arizona, and the University of Arizona. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Wagner has worked 
as a ranch manager, an auctioneer, a wran-
gler, and a volunteer firefighter. 
In 2015, he became the Vice President of 
Vineyards for Foley Family Wines. Later, he 
was promoted to Senior Vice President of 
Foley Family Farms. Mr. Wagner oversees 61 
properties and over 200 employees. 
Mr. Wagner is a staunch advocate for sus-
tainable farming practices. He has received 
awards for his work in the Salinas Resource 
Conservation District and served as a member 
of the Napa Sustainable Winegrowing Group 
for years. Mr. Wagner served as the director 
of the Napa Valley Expo Board for nine years, 
during which he pushed the board to approve 
the use of Merlot Hall as a winter homeless 
shelter. He worked closely with the Napa 
County Health and Human Services to ensure 
the proposal was approved. Mr. Wagner was 
also instrumental in bringing the BottleRock 
Napa Valley festival to Napa County. 
A loving husband, father, and grandfather, 
Mr. Wagner now lives in Sutter County with 
his family on a small farm. He still makes the 
commute to Napa and Sonoma counties sev-
eral times a week to oversee his vineyards. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Al 
Wagner is an exemplary member of our com-
munity. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor him here today.

HONORING 
THE 
30TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE VETERANS CON-
SORTIUM 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
30th anniversary of The Veterans Consortium, 
a nonprofit organization providing pro bono 
services to our nation’s veterans with cases 
pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
Veterans Claims (CAVC). 
The Veterans Consortium was established 
after the first Chief Judge of the Court of Ap-
peals for Veterans Claims encouraged Con-
gress to create a program to provide veterans 
with suitable legal representation before the 
Court—and help them receive every dollar in 
benefits they are entitled to. 
A competitive grant was awarded to The 
Veterans Consortium for the formation of a 
legal 
services 
corporation 
to 
carry 
out 
Congress’s wishes. Although today it is an 
independent nonprofit, The Veterans Consor-
tium’s founding members are four hallmark 
veterans advocacy organizations: The Amer-
ican Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Na-
tional Veterans Legal Services Program, and 
Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
Over the past 3 decades, The Veterans 
Consortium has become one of the most 
prominent organizations providing pro bono 
services for veterans’ claims, with almost 
6,000 volunteer attorneys having delivered 
over $400 million in rightful benefits, care, and 
compensation to American veterans. They did 
so by astoundingly winning over 83 percent of 
their appeals cases. 
While this number demonstrates the effec-
tiveness of the Consortium, it also under-
scores significant room for improvement in the 
Department of Veterans Affairs benefits deter-
mination process. That’s what makes the work 
of The Veterans Consortium so important. 
As Chair of the Military Construction and 
Veterans Affairs Appropriations subcommittee, 
I have the distinct honor and responsibility of 
leading the only committee in Congress that 
cares for our servicemembers through their 
entire lifecycle: both during and after their 
service. 
I’m proud to work with our VSOs to ensure 
those who have risked their lives for this Na-
tion are supported throughout their transition 
to civilian life and are able to age with dignity. 
A critical component of that work is ensuring 
the Veterans Benefits Administration is ade-
quately funded and that our veterans receive 
the benefits they need and are entitled to. 
We know the benefits and claims process is 
in dire need of reform, and it has been for 
years now. That is why I will continue working 
with VA Secretary McDonough to improve 
upon the existing system, and by conducting 
rigorous oversight of all VA agencies to en-
sure they are spending the money we provide 
effectively. 
Congress can honor our veterans—and the 
decades of committed work of The Veterans 
Consortium—by legislating and using the 
power of the purse to make sure the benefits 
and claims process is working for those who 
served their country. For all that veterans sac-
rifice for this Nation, the least we can do is en-
sure they receive the benefits they were prom-
ised and deserve. 
Congratulations to the Veterans Consortium 
and the TVC National Volunteer Corps on 30 
impactful years, and I thank them for all the 
critically important work they do.

THE 
GREEN-
WICH WITCHES ON A VICTORY 
AT THE CLASS C STATE SOFT-
BALL CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Greenwich High 
School softball team on an extraordinary sea-
son culminating in a win at the state cham-
pionship game. 
The Greenwich Witches won the state 
championship softball game at Moriches Ath-
letic Complex over the Greene Trojans, by a 
score of four to one. Led by Coach Bill Curley, 
the Greenwich Witches rose to the challenge 
during their final game and, after an amazing 
comeback, the team pushed the game into an 
extra inning. Trailing by one run in the fourth 
inning, the Witches responded with a run of 
their own during the sixth inning and tied the 
game. In the top of the eighth inning, the 
Witches scored three more runs and sealed 
their state championship victory. 
After a hard-fought semifinal game earlier in 
the day, the Greenwich Witches’ perseverance 
ultimately allowed them to succeed in the final. 
They won the state championship thanks to 
the hard work and dedication of the entire 
team. Pitcher Lily McCauliffe helped carry the 
team to victory with nine strikeouts during the 
championship game and eleven in the pre-
vious semifinal game. In the championship 
game, the Greenwich Witches began their 
comeback with a critical double hit by Reese 
Autiello. Additionally, Faith Ingber and Kiley 
Allen scored significant runs that carried the 
Witches to victory. Their perseverance and de-
termination are truly inspirational and worthy

HONORING BLOUNT MEMORIAL 
HOSPITAL’S 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the 75th anniversary of Blount Me-
morial Hospital. 
Blount Memorial Hospital first opened its 
doors on July 24, 1947, thanks to members of 
the community who worked together to make 
it a reality. They named the hospital in honor 
of the brave Blount County citizens who 
served our country, those who died or went 
missing in the line of duty, and those who con-
tinue to serve today. 
For over seven decades, Blount Memorial 
Hospital grew and expanded its ability to pro-
vide care to East Tennesseans. In 2019, the 
hospital joined the Mayo Clinic network and 
gained access to research, diagnostic, and 
treatment resources that allow Blount Memo-
rial to provide better care to every patient that 
walks through its doors. 
Today, Blount Memorial Hospital is nation-
ally recognized for its heart attack and stroke 
care, and currently has fifteen facilities in two 
counties that treat hundreds of thousands of 
patients each year. Residents of Blount Coun-
ty also benefit economically from the hospital’s 
presence, since Blount Memorial Hospital con-
tributes roughly 15 to 20 percent of the coun-
ty’s economy, employs over 2,500 local citi-
zens, and has—over the past 10 years—pro-
vided over $400 million in charity and uncom-
pensated care for folks in our community. 
For 75 years, Blount Memorial Hospital and 
its employees have valiantly served the citi-
zens of Blount County while forging lasting re-
lationships with the community. It is my honor 
to recognize them on this historic anniversary.

HONORING THE HABEMATOLEL 
POMO TRIBE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
honor 
the 
Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake Tribe on 
the 10th anniversary of the opening of their 
Running Creek Casino in Lake County, Cali-
fornia. 
The people of the Habematolel Pomo Tribe 
have ancient origins in Lake County. Following 
the arrival of Europeans, the Pomo were the 
targets of repeated efforts of genocide, either 
through systemic violence or forced assimila-
tion. Fortunately, these efforts were unsuc-
cessful, and after a 1983 federal court case 
granted the Habematolel Pomo federal rec-
ognition and a portion of land in Upper Lake, 
the Tribe began a campaign of economic sus-
tainability that continues today. 
The federal recognition of the Habematolel 
Pomo brought great opportunity to Lake Coun-
ty. Setting out to build a casino, the tribe 
worked with Lake County and regional offi-
cials, along with the community at-large, to 
create a series of Memorandums of Under-
standing that would guarantee the tribe’s con-
tributions to the County for years to come. 
This exciting opportunity came at a time when 
Lake County had the highest unemployment 
rate in all of California. 
Since the opening of Running Creek Casino 
in May of 2012, the people of Habematolel 
Pomo Tribe have accelerated steady eco-
nomic growth in Lake County. The Casino cre-
ated 140 new jobs, provided the County over 
$378,000 to improve the Lake County Sanita-
tion District’s wastewater system, contributed 
a one-time donation of $636,000 to the 
Northshore Fire Protection District for fire and 
safety mitigation, and granted $130,000 for 
field lighting at a local high school. 
Beyond its monetary contributions to local 
government, the people of the Habematolel 
Pomo Tribe serve dutifully on local institutions, 
such as the Northshore Business Association, 
the Lake County Chamber of Commerce, and 
the Lake County Tribal Health Consortium. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that the 
Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake and its peo-
ple have tirelessly served the people and land 
of Lake County. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor the tribe and its mem-
bers here today.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF RALPH 
FRASURE 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to one of Eastern 
Kentucky’s 
fallen 
heroes, 
Ralph 
Harlow 
Frasure, a 39-year law enforcement veteran 
who was one of three officers killed in the line 
of duty in Allen, Kentucky. Frasure was Cap-
tain of the Prestonsburg City Police Depart-
ment for nearly four decades and a beloved 
School Resource Officer at Prestonsburg High 
School. 
The best law enforcement officers will tell 
you it isn’t a job, it’s a calling; and it was with 
great courage of conviction that Captain 
Frasure lived to protect the people of 
Prestonsburg and all of Floyd County. 
President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a 
former commissioner of the New York City Po-
lice Department once said, ‘‘No man is worth 
his salt, who is not ready at all times to risk 
his body, to risk his well-being, to risk his life 
in a great cause.’’ On Thursday, June 30, 
2022, Captain Frasure paid the ultimate sac-
rifice as he valiantly answered the call of duty 
to protect others in Floyd County. 
His heroic death was the greatest display of 
love described in John 15:13, ‘‘Greater love 
has no man than this: to lay down his life for 
his friends.’’ 
In a Nation where police forces have been 
vilified in recent years by the actions of a few 
bad actors, may Captain Frasure’s life be a re-
minder of the outstanding integrity and sac-
rifice that the thin blue line represents. We 
must continue to support our law enforcement 
officers across the United States, ensuring 
they are fully equipped, adequately prepared, 
and never at the mercy of evildoers. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky owes a 
great debt of gratitude for the life and service 
of Captain Ralph Frasure. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his wife Clearnce, their sons 
Ralph Kelly Frasure and Robert Clarence 
Frasure, daughter Stacy (Mike), their grand-
children, and the widespread band of brothers 
and sisters in uniform who served alongside 
Captain Frasure throughout his career. May 
his loved ones find peace and confidence in 
God’s promise in Matthew 5:9, ‘‘Blessed are 
the peacemakers, for they will be called chil-
dren of God.’’

RECOGNIZING KENNEDY 
ANDERSON 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Kennedy Anderson for her serv-
ice to my office. 
Kennedy joined our team as our D.C. staff 
assistant in July 2021, and quickly proved her-
self indispensable to our organization. In Feb-
ruary of this year, she took on additional re-
sponsibility with my communications team and 
was promoted to staff assistant/press and dig-
ital assistant. Kennedy embodies our office’s 
values of excellence, kindness, service, re-
sponsiveness, productivity, and accessibility. 
Kennedy’s role is demanding and involves 
serving not only our staff, but also our broader 
community, as well as managing our paid in-
ternship program. On top of this workload, she 
always finds time to connect with each col-
league, mentor each intern, and identify op-
portunities to improve our office’s operations 
and constituent communication. 
In her management of the internship pro-
gram, she often went above and beyond, pro-
viding additional skills training, life advice, and 
job seeking support to talented young people 
with ambitions for public service. She worked 
with our Chief of Staff to improve recruitment 
of 
interns 
from 
underrepresented 
back-
grounds. Kennedy unfailingly treats all who 
interact with my office with respect and enthu-
siasm and is among those special people 
whose positive energy illuminates a room— 
even a Zoom room. During our office’s cele-
bration of Black History Month, she shared

facing and rising above discrimination in the 
Jim Crow South and pioneering their way to 
success in professions where Black Ameri-
cans are under represented. She also took a 
leadership role in supporting diversity, equity, 
and inclusion in our office by bringing edu-
cational programming to our staff meetings. 
We will miss the joy and creativity Kennedy 
brings to our office, the sweet potato pie she 
brought to our office holiday party, and her 
being the one staff member who truly commits 
to the theme on celebratory Zoom gath-
erings—sometimes even through costume. 
Prior to joining my staff, Kennedy earned a 
Bachelor’s degree from Converse University in 
Spartanburg, South Carolina. 
We are incredibly proud of Kennedy’s pro-
fessional growth in the time she has been with 
our office and wish her the best in her next 
opportunities. Although Kennedy may be leav-
ing our office, our community in northern Illi-
nois and my entire staff will always consider 
her as part of Team Underwood. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to formally thank Ken-
nedy Anderson for her service to my office, to 
Illinois’ 14th Congressional District, and to our 
country.

HONORING OLE HEALTH 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor OLE Health, the 
only nonprofit health center in Napa County, in 
celebration of its 50 years of outstanding serv-
ice in California’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Since its founding in 1972, OLE Health has 
provided quality and affordable healthcare in 
the Napa Valley regardless of patients’ health 
insurance coverage, immigration status, or fi-
nancial resources. OLE Health provides an 
array of services, including medical, dental, 
behavioral health, pharmacy, nutrition, optom-
etry, care coordination, and referrals. 
OLE Health serves the most vulnerable 
members of our community. Most of OLE 
Health’s patients live at or below 200 percent 
of the federal poverty line, and OLE Health’s 
dedicated team of healthcare professionals 
consistently provide vital healthcare to those 
experiencing homelessness in our community. 
OLE Health is also the only fully bilingual 
healthcare center that offers all services in 
Spanish and English. Over the last 50 years, 
OLE Health has built healthcare centers in 
Napa, St. Helena, Calistoga, and most re-
cently, 
Fairfield-Suisun. 
Today, 
the 
OLE 
Health team provides care to 25 percent of 
Napa County residents and treats 40,000 pa-
tients every year. 
On top of offering a wide variety of acces-
sible and quality healthcare services, OLE 
Health also holds monthly food distributions in 
Napa and Calistoga that provide fresh produce 
and healthy foods to 300 families each month. 
OLE Health also offers enrollment services 
that connect anyone in our community with 
suitable healthcare coverage plans and help 
eligible individuals apply for CalFresh or other 
assistance programs. Additionally, since the 
beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, OLE 
Health has distributed over 60,000 vaccine 
doses, offering even more life-saving care to 
the community. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that OLE 
Health has been a critical establishment in our 
community, providing vital and accessible 
services for so many in our district. Therefore, 
it is fitting and proper that we honor the orga-
nization and its staff here today.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
BRADFORD C. FREEMAN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Bradford Clark 
Freeman. Mr. Freeman (Mr. B. to his friends) 
was born September 4, 1924, in Artesia, MS 
to Erwyn and Ollie Freeman. He had four 
brothers and three sisters. 
He graduated from Artesia High School in 
1942. He was a freshman at Mississippi State 
when WWII started. He then volunteered for 
the paratroopers. On February 5, 1944, he 
went into Foreign Service with 506th Para-
chute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Divi-
sion. He was a mortarman for Easy Company. 
He jumped in the D-Day Normandy invasion, 
fought in Operation Market-Garden, and was 
part of the defense of Bastogne during the 
Battle of the Bulge, where he was wounded. 
He was able to rejoin his unit and participated 
in the occupations of Berchtesgaden and Aus-
tria. 
After the war, he returned to Caledonia and 
married Willie Louise Gurley on June 29, 
1947, and worked as a mail carrier for 32

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
MISSION 
OF 
SHRIMAD 
RAJCHANDRA 
LOVE 
AND CARE USA TO SERVE COM-
MUNITIES IN NEED ACROSS THE 
WORLD 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the global mission of 
Shrimad Rajchandra Love and Care (SRLC) 
USA and the selfless Americans who serve 
communities in need across the world. 
Led by thousands of highly motivated volun-
teers, SRLC is a global initiative that endeav-
ors to meet the needs of the underprivileged 
through multi-pronged community support and 
development programs and other forms of 
educational, medical, and humanitarian care. 
Since its founding in 2003, SRLC has carried 
out its noble mission in big cities and small 
towns all over the world. With over 5,000 vol-
unteers—most of whom carry distinguished 
expertise in medicine, engineering, and fi-
nance, and are active initiatives in over 50 cit-
ies worldwide—SRLC’s mission to reduce 
human suffering is global and far-reaching. 
Importantly, SRLC offers individuals a safe- 
haven in the face of armed conflict, relief from 
climate-related disasters, and access to med-
ical care and other critical resources to battle 
the COVID–19 pandemic. In this effort, SRLC 
volunteers serve on the front lines of recovery 
efforts, rising to the challenges associated with 
providing emergency shelter to families im-
pacted by devastating floods, tornadoes, fires, 
and other disasters. But don’t just take my 
word for it; the data speaks for itself. Accord-
ing to recent estimates, SRLC has assisted 
more than 1.45 million patients in rural areas 
receive access to medical care to improve 
both physical and mental wellness in under-
served communities. The organization has 
also impacted the lives of 1.47 million school 
children through educational initiatives that, for 
example, teach literacy and financial inde-
pendence. In addition, SRLC has helped 2.34 
million people through its humanitarian initia-
tives to combat homelessness, food insecurity, 
and economic disparity. 
It is for this reason that SRLC now enjoys 
Special Consultative Status with the United 
Nations Economic and Social Council, a posi-
tion it has held since 2020. 
Throughout our history, Americans have al-
ways stepped up for one another in times of 
crisis. The obligation to be there for our fellow 
citizens is woven into the very fabric of our na-
tion. For almost 20 years, this spirit of selfless-
ness has been exemplified by Shrimad 
Rajchandra Love and Care (SRLC) USA and 
its devoted team of volunteers. It is my privi-
lege to honor the important mission of SRLC 
and encourage all Americans to renew our 
collective commitment to lend a helping hand 
to those most in need.

AGRICUL-
TURAL LEADER BOB RULFS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the incredible 
life and impact of Bob Rulfs. Mr. Rulfs was the 
founder of Rulfs Orchard in Peru, New York, 
a family-owned and operated orchard, bakery, 
cafe, and roadside farm stand. 
Mr. Rulfs always dreamed of owning his 
own dairy farm when he was growing up. This 
dream was realized in 1952 when he pur-
chased a farm in Peru, New York. The farm’s 
humble beginnings consisted of four milk 
cows, twelve acres of apple trees, and Mr. 
Rulfs selling his apples out of a wagon on his 
front lawn. Over the years, Rulfs Orchard has 
expanded and now includes over fifty acres of 
corn, forty acres of apples, a thirty-acre pump-
kin patch, and much more. The orchard has 
become a cornerstone of the Peru community. 
Mr. Rulfs worked on the orchard for seventy 
years and was always happy to greet and talk 
with everyone that stepped into the shop. His

positive impact was apparent to everyone who 
had the pleasure of stepping into Rulfs Or-
chard, and he will be dearly missed by the 
North Country community. 
Mr. Rulfs is a glowing example of everything 
that is good about farming, family, and the 
North Country. He loved his community and 
lovingly referred to the North Country as 
‘‘God’s Country.’’ His legacy will live on in the 
hearts of everyone who had the pleasure of 
knowing him. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
Congressional District, it is my honor to re-
member and celebrate the life of Bob Rulfs.

HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA

Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Oscar De Haro 
for his over 17 years of service as Super-
intendent of Student Affairs at Napa Valley 
College. 
Born in Jerez, Mexico, Mr. De Haro immi-
grated to St. Helena, California, at a young 
age. He worked in the vineyards in Napa Val-
ley, the apple orchards in Sebastopol, and the 
strawberry fields in Salinas. After graduating

San Jose State University. Prior to joining 
Napa Valley College, Mr. De Haro spent 16 
years at Mendocino College as an Assistant 
Dean of Special Services and Programs and 
Dean of Student Services. 
Throughout his career, Mr. De Haro has 
made significant contributions to our commu-
nity through his commitment to education and 
his efforts to uplift our Hispanic community. 
Mr. De Haro is recognized for spearheading 
the ‘‘Declare Yourself’’ campaign at Napa Val-
ley College, allowing the college to become an 
Hispanic Serving Institution. Mr. De Haro is 
also recognized for his contributions to the 
Latinos in Napa History Project at Napa Valley 
College and the Legacy Bracero Program in 
Napa. 
In addition to his illustrious career, Mr. De 
Haro has taken on many philanthropic projects 
within our community. Mr. De Haro has helped 
organize the Cultural Festival at Napa Valley 
College, and he has been a strong supporter 
of the Dı´a de la Familia at St. John’s the Bap-
tist Catholic Church. He also serves as a 
member of the Multicultural Committee in St. 
Helena. Mr. De Haro always made himself 
available to his students, displaying genuine 
care and concern for their success in and out 
of the office. He has always been passionate 
about helping students achieve their goals and 
fervently believed that ‘‘Students are our Busi-
ness—Our only Business!’’ After years of dedi-
cated service, Mr. De Haro retired from his 
role at Napa Valley College on June 30, 2022. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. De 
Haro has worked tirelessly for the betterment 
of the Napa Valley community. Therefore, it is 
fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today. 
CELEBRATING THE 2022 RAYMOND 
TOWN FAIR 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the Raymond Town Fair. As the 
summer months heat up and the nights grow 
later, town fairs and festivals take on special 
importance not only as opportunities to gather 
with friends but meet new members of the 
community and celebrate the history of this 
town. Raymond encapsulates some of the 
Granite State’s best qualities, and tonight’s 
celebration serves as a shining example of 
what this town has to offer the state of New 
Hampshire. 
From the fireman’s parade and morning 
pancake breakfast to the annual pageants that 
kick off the fair, Raymond has enshrined its 
sense of community with timeless traditions 
and open arms to all who are joining for the 
first time. For decades, this fair served as an 
opportunity 
for 
local 
businesses 
and 
craftspeople to establish themselves in Ray-
mond. Now in the present day, vendors from 
across New England are bringing their goods 
and services to Raymond because of its rep-
utation for friendliness and community-build-
ing. This legacy of excellence will only con-
tinue into the future, and I can’t wait to see the 
success of this fair in the years to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Town of Raymond for hosting 
such an excellent fair. I also want to give my 
special thanks to Phil Merrill, his wife Tracy, 
and the Raymond Town Fair Committee for 
their work making this year’s fair possible. I 
look forward to a continued partnership with 
Raymond and its residents who I am proud to 
represent in Congress.

RECOGNIZING PMC PHARMACY 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition and appreciation of the 
employees of PMC Pharmacy, located in our 
community in Horsham, Pennsylvania for their 
tireless efforts in combating the Nation’s opioid 
epidemic while balancing the need to serve 
patients suffering with chronic pain via the 
pharmacy’s RelieveRx Program. For over 18 
years, the employees of PMC Pharmacy have 
dedicated their professional careers to serving 
a population of patients who have traditionally 
been left underserved because of the social 
stigma that oftentimes accompanies a patient 
suffering from a chronic pain condition. 
Throughout PMC’s existence, their employ-
ees have helped improve the quality of life for 
countless patients in my district while ensuring 
that bad actors are identified and removed 
from the legitimate patient population. Our na-
tion’s opioid epidemic is complex, and thanks 
to the efforts of PMC’s employees, those in 
need of care continue to find the service that 
they deserve and require to simply live their 
lives. I am proud to recognize and celebrate 
the following PMC Pharmacy employees who 
are exceptional examples of service to our 
community: 
Brian Dunleavy 
Alex Antosh 
Harry Branson 
Jordan Capanna 
Tracy Clerihan 
Christine Deni 
Mark Knopka 
Steve Kulp 
James McMenamin 
Stefanie Stein 
Cindy Thomson 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive 
impact these women and men have had on 
our community through their commitment to 
serve those suffering with chronic pain, and 
we wish them continued success as they con-
tinue their much-needed work.

HOMETOWN HERO—GIVING 
GARDEN 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Giving Garden of 
Carrollton, a nonprofit community garden that 
not only creates a welcoming space for North 
Texans, but provides sustainable food to local 
food pantries. 
The Giving Garden, which was started by 
Aldersgate United Methodist Church and Keep 
Carrollton Beautiful, allows North Texans from 
all walks of life to participate in this wonderful 
gardening community. 
Every day, the Garden fulfills its mission to 
promote nutritious food, educate gardeners, 
allow for social interaction in the community, 
and most importantly, give to those in need. 
Last year, the Garden donated over 4,400 
pounds of locally grown produce to food pan-
tries across the metroplex, providing fresh 
fruits and vegetables to many families in need. 
By successfully carrying out its goals, the 
Giving Garden has truly made a difference in 
North Texas. I thank the many participants of 
this wonderful community garden. I am also 
incredibly grateful for their efforts to make 
North Texas a better place to live.

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Cope Fam-
ily Center for its 50 years of remarkable family 
support and child abuse prevention services in 
California’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Fifty years ago, a child in the City of Napa 
tragically died due to child-abuse-related 
causes. Concerned parents in the city took ac-
tion and established the Cope Family Center 
to prevent similar events from happening in 
the future. They envisioned a future where all 
children could live in happy, healthy homes, 
and live to reach the bright future they de-
served. For the past half a century, that vision

has guided the Cope Family Center as they 
continue to serve children and families across 
Napa. 
Though much has changed since its found-
ing in 1972, the Cope Family Center is still 
working hard to protect children. It has served 
over 82,000 parents and caregivers in Napa 
County with support services to prevent ad-
verse childhood experiences and build resil-
ience so they can raise children who thrive. It 
provides strength-based parent education, 
home visiting, and basic needs support to par-
ents struggling with stress. The center also 
provides services that encourage healthy fam-
ily relationships, enhance childhood develop-
ment, and build strong community connec-
tions. 
The Cope Family Center has widened its 
services to also address community needs in 
times of disaster, such as wildfires and the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Now a two-million-dollar 
organization with 24 staff members, the center 
has the power to advocate for positive change 
to systemic issues affecting children and fami-
lies in our district. The Cope Family Center is 
a member and the financial lead of the Com-
munity Leaders Coalition, which works to build 
a vibrant community and respond to policy 
that may cause concern in the community. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that the Cope 
Family Center has been an instrumental insti-
tution through its work to improve the lives of 
countless families in our district. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor the organi-
zation and its staff here today.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
MCHENRY 
MU-
SEUM & HISTORICAL SOCIETY 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the McHenry Museum & Historical Society. 
Through its work over the last five decades, 
the McHenry Museum & Historical Society has 
served as a center for cultural enrichment, 
learning, and inspiration for our community in 
the Central Valley. 
Located in the heart of downtown Modesto, 
the McHenry Museum welcomes thousands of 
visitors annually and works to preserve our 
local history. It’s the continuation of a long tra-
dition of public servants and committed com-
munity members working together to make 
sure that our community has a place to gather 
and celebrate its history. Modesto’s first mu-
seum was opened in 1968 by the Citizens’ 
Cultural Committee. By 1971, The City of Mo-
desto recognized the success these efforts to 
chronicle early Modesto. It was then, that the 
vacated McHenry Public Library building con-
verted into the McHenry Museum and Art 
Center. 
The Museum was dedicated on July 4, 
1972, when it took residence in the McHenry 
Public Library. One room became the chang-
ing exhibit room, another to display historic 
paintings, and the third was devoted to ‘‘per-
manent’’ displays. The auditorium was also 
part of the museum and was used for a vari-
ety of events from musical presentations to 
city council meetings. 
To this day, the McHenry Museum & Histor-
ical Society continues to preserve our history 
and uplift the arts in a way that inspires our 
community. I thank the McHenry Museum & 
Historical Society volunteers, employees, gen-
erous donors, Board of Directors, Committee 
members, and public servants who give their 
time and energy to ensure that this incredible 
landmark will be around for decades to come.

HONORING 
COLONEL 
MAURA 
HENNIGAN, UNITED STATES MA-
RINE CORPS 
HON. KAIALI‘I KAHELE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and recognize a friend, leader, and a 
Marine. In August of 2020, Colonel Hennigan 
was hand-selected by the Commandant of the 
Marine Corps to assume the duties as the Di-
rector of the Marine Corps House Liaison Of-
fice. Colonel Hennigan’s selection was the re-
sult of an impeccable record of service and 
her vast experience in the Marine Corps. 
Throughout her tenure, Colonel Hennigan 
led the daily operations of the House office 
with uncanny skill and aplomb. Her acute 
awareness and in-depth insight allowed her to 
facilitate a shared understanding between the 
Marine Corps and the House of Representa-
tives. Her relationship with myself and many 
Members of Congress is one that we have 
valued greatly. Colonel Hennigan’s unique 
leadership skills and interpersonal abilities al-
lowed her to be an incredible advocate on be-
half of the Commandant of the Marine Corps. 
After graduating from the University of Mary 
Washington, she was commissioned in 1994. 
Throughout her career she has commanded 
various units from platoon to group levels, and 
deployments to combat zones. She served as 
a Marine Corps Commandant’s Fellow at the 
United States Institute of Peace and studied 
Women, Peace and Security. She also has 
held multiple assignments in Hawaii at both 
Marine Corps Air Station Kane’ohe, and 
United States Pacific Command. 
In 2022, President Biden nominated Colonel 
Hennigan for the rank of a Brigadier General, 
making her only the 16th female general offi-
cer in the history of the Marine Corps. On be-
half of myself, and all my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives, we wish her luck in 
all her future endeavors and success leading 
Marines of the future. She will always have a 
home in the great state of Hawaii. She will be 
greatly missed. Po¯maika‘i, Maura.

HONORING JOEL ROGERS 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Joel Rogers for 
his outstanding public service to the people of 
California and his country. 
Mr. Rogers was born in Glen Cove, New 
York. In 1980, he graduated from University of 
California, Santa Cruz with a bachelor’s de-
gree in political science. Thereafter, he worked 
for Governor Jerry Brown in Washington DC 
until 1982. From 1983 to 1991, Mr. Rogers 
served as the Legislative Director for former 
Representative Douglas Bosco. After his ca-
reer in D.C., he moved to Sonoma County 
where he served as a board member on the 
Piner-Olivet Union School District Board from 
1996 to 1998. 
Mr. Rogers was very passionate about pro-
tecting California’s fishing industry. He was in-
strumental in developing legislation that im-
proved the conditions of fisheries on Califor-
nia’s North Coast. These bills, which were 
written by Representative Bosco’s office and 
signed into law by Presidents Ronald Reagan 
and George H. Bush, include the Klamath 
River Restoration Act, the Trinity River Res-
toration Act, the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act, 
the Cordell Banks National Marine Sanctuary, 
and the Smith River National Recreation Area. 
Mr. Rogers had a strong interest in national 
affairs, and as a result, he played an active 
and vital role in supporting Representative 
Bosco’s position on the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
According 
to 
Representative 
Bosco, Mr. Rogers was ‘‘always informed, cur-
rent, and patient in dealing with the myriad 
issues involved [in national affairs].’’ Addition-
ally, Mr. Rogers’ ‘‘kind, quiet demeanor belied 
an intense commitment to national affairs, es-
pecially related to the Reagan Administration’s 
policies in Central America and the general in-
crease in Pentagon spending.’’ 
Mr. Rogers passed away on March 26, 
2022. His family remembers him as a selfless, 
kind, and compassionate father. Mr. Rogers is 
survived by his wife, Vicky, to whom he was 
married for 39 years, his children, Jackie, 
Bobby and Nick, and his mother, Midlred Rog-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that Joel 
Rogers was a dedicated and hard-working 
public servant. Therefore, it is fitting and prop-
er that we honor him and his legacy here 
today.

Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-

ington, D.C. and obtained a Ph.D. in Econom-
ics from George Washington University and a

July 7, 2022 
Professionally, Dr. Glover is a star. She 
spearheaded the creation of the country’s first 
HBCU-based Ph.D. program in business at 
Jackson State University, and chaired the De-
partment of Accounting at Howard University’s 
School of Business. She has been a leader in 
the private sector, and currently serves as the 
President of her beloved alma mater, Ten-
nessee State University, since 2013. Dr. Glov-
er is not just the President either: she was the 
Thurgood Marshall College Fund’s HBCU 
President of the Year in 2018, and HBCU Di-
gest’s 2019 Female President of the Year. 
Dr. Glover did all of that while maintaining a 
leadership role in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
Incorporated. Initiated into the Alpha Psi 
Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incor-
porated at Tennessee State University, where 
she served as President and Vice-President 
as an undergraduate. Dr. Glover has also 
served as President, Vice-President, and

Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated in 
Jackson, Mississippi before moving up to 
International 
Vice-President, 
International 
Treasurer, and Treasurer to the Educational 
Advancement Foundation (EAF) of the entire 
Sorority. 
Since assuming the International Presidency 
and CEO role in 2018, Dr. Glover has led our 
Sorors powerfully to sustain us through the 
pandemic, and raised our voices on critical 
issues like Voting Rights and Black Maternal 
Health—ensuring that Sorors of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority, Incorporated are the VOICE of 
the movement, not the ECHO. Dr. Glover’s 
Alpha Kappa Alpha Congressional Women’s 
Roundtable continues to lead the charge to-
ward solutions to create a better world for fu-
ture generations by fighting for continued, 
meaningful investments in HBCUs, a com-
prehensive approach to ending the maternal 
health crisis in America and protecting our de-
mocracy through safeguarding and expanding 
voting rights. 
Dr. Glover has convened meetings with our 
Soror, Vice-President KAMALA HARRIS, to bring 
our community’s needs to the highest level of 
our government and is the Vice-Chair of Presi-
dent Joe Biden’s HBCU Advisory Board. 
I, and every Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, In-
corporated Soror, am indebted to Dr. Glover 
for her service to our Sorority. She is a living 
pillar of Black Excellence, and her leadership 
has and continues to lift up successive gen-

enduring legacy, her enriching sisterhood, and 
her exemplary service, let’s remember the pur-
pose that has animated her to succeed and to 
bring her community up with her.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DR. MAY EDWARD CHINN 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise on 
behalf of the 13th Congressional District of 
New York in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives to honor and reflect on the life and leg-
acy of Dr. May Edward Chinn, an American 
woman physician of Black and Chickahominy 
descent. It is an honor to highlight this remark-
able story of dedication and fortitude in the 
field of early cervical cancer detection re-
search. 
After becoming the first Black woman to 
graduate from Bellevue Hospital Medical Col-
lege in 1926, now known as New York Univer-
sity Grossman School of Medicine, May E. 
Chinn was the first Black woman to complete 
an internship at Harlem Hospital in 1928. Be-
cause of segregation, hospitals in New York 
did not grant hospital privileges to female phy-
sicians of color. Dr. Chinn worked with other 
doctors in Harlem at a private practice, 
Edgecombe Sanitarium, for patients of color. 
She often rode in ambulances saving injured 
patients’ lives before they reached a hospital. 
Denied the ability to use hospital equipment, 
Dr. Chinn performed surgeries in patients’ 
homes. 
In 1933, she entered Columbia University’s 
School of Public Health where she earned a 
Master of Science degree. Her studies there 
connected her to medical researcher Dr. 
George Papanicolaou. May Chinn contributed 
to Dr. Papanicolaou’s research in developing 
cytological methods for the study of cancer. 
Those studies culminated in the test known 
worldwide as the Pap Test. 
In 1940, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia declared 
that Harlem Hospital must grant Dr. Chinn 
hospital privileges. Due to Dr. Chinn’s exper-
tise in cancer, she was hired at the Strang 
Cancer Clinic by founder Dr. Elise Strang in 
1944 and worked there until 1974 while main-
taining her private practice. She worked as a 
clinician with the Department of Health Day 
Care Centers from 1960 to 1977. She never 
married, but she offered advice and support to 
her 19 Godchildren. 
May E. Chinn was the daughter of William 
Lafayette Chinn of African American & Cauca-
sian descent and Lulu Ann Evans Chinn of Af-
rican American & Chickahominy descent. 
May’s mother worked as a cook and house-
keeper, saved money, and encouraged May to 
continue with her studies. May went to the 
Bordentown Manual and Training Industrial 
School, a boarding school in New Jersey and 
spent one year (1901–1902) of her childhood 
on the estate of Charles Tiffany, the jewelry 
magnate, where her mother was a live-in 
cook. The Tiffany’s treated Chinn like family 
and took her to classical music concerts in 
New York City. She later learned to play the 
piano and became an accompanist to popular 
singer Paul Robeson in the early 1920s. Chinn 
played classical and gospel music throughout 
her life and performed for African American 
soldiers during World War I. 
For her work in cancer detection, Dr. May 
Edward Chinn was awarded membership into 
the New York Academy of Sciences in 1954, 
was referenced by the New York City Cancer 
Committee of the American Cancer Society in 
1957 and was awarded an honorary doctorate 
by Columbia University in 1980. She also 
helped found the Susan Smith McKinney 
Steward Medical Society in 1975 to help Black 
women attend medical school. In her honor, 
the New York Metropolitan Coordinating Coun-
cil of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. estab-
lished the Dr. May Edward Chinn Scholarship 
awarded to women furthering their education 
in science. For over 50 years, Dr. May E. 
Chinn served the residents of Harlem. 
Dr. May Edward Chinn provided a road map 
for helping others. In her unpublished auto-
biography, she wrote, ‘‘Become involved with 
the problems of your Nation, your State, your 
city and especially your immediate neighbor-
hood. Help those with problems—help them to 
take the next step UPWARDS.’’ 
An unsung pioneer, May Edward Chinn, 
Black female physician, improved the lives of 
thousands by providing the best health care 
for 53 years. Dr. Chinn’s brilliance and perse-
verance inspires us all.

HONORING RON NERSESIAN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Ron Nersesian 
in celebration of his outstanding career at 
Keysight Technologies and his dedicated sup-
port to his employees in times of crisis. 
Mr. Nersesian was born in New York City 
and attended Lehigh University in Pennsyl-
vania where he earned a bachelor’s degree in 
electrical engineering. Later, he completed a 
master’s degree in business administration 
from New York University Stern School of 
Business. 
Mr. Nersesian dedicated the past 30 years 
to Keysight Technologies in Santa Rosa and 
its predecessors. After serving as President 
and Chief Operations Officer at Agilent Tech-
nologies, Mr. Nersesian became Keysight 
Technologies’ first Chief Executive Officer in 
2013. He led his company to success during 
some of the most challenging times in our 
community. The 2017 Tubbs Fire damaged 
Keysight Technologies campus in Santa Rosa, 
and hundreds of employees lost homes. Mr. 
Nersesian provided disaster pay to affected 
staff, established an employee relief center 
with meals and helped find temporary housing 
for employees and their families. 
During 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
Mr. 
Nersesian put his company’s resources toward 
charitable efforts. Keysight Technologies made 
more than $1 million in contributions to non- 
profits and donated personal protective equip-
ment and janitorial supplies to charitable relief, 
healthcare and emergency responder organi-
zations 
around 
the 
world. 
Under 
Mr. 
Nersesian’s leadership, none of his 17,000 
employees lost their job nor wages as a direct 
result of the pandemic. 
Mr. Nersesian is also a member of the 
Georgia Tech Advisory Council, the North Bay 
Leadership Council, and Forbes Technology 
Council. Additionally, he created STEM en-
gagement opportunities for K–12 students and 
virtual mentorship programs to fill gaps in in-
tern and volunteer opportunities during the 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. Ron 
Nersesian has dedicated his life to serving the 
people of Sonoma County through his leader-
ship and great generosity. Therefore, it is fit-
ting and proper that we honor him here today.

HONORING JOHN B. BILLINGSLEY, 
JR. 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor John B. Billingsley, Jr., Found-
er, Chairman and CEO of Tri Global Energy, 
headquartered in the 24th Congressional Dis-
trict, which I proudly represent. John has been 
widely recognized as a pioneer and industry 
leader for his vision and contributions to the 
development of renewable energy in Texas 
and the U.S., including by D CEO Magazine. 
Recently, Billingsley was named Renewable 
Energy Executive of the Year by D CEO mag-
azine as a part of their annual Energy Awards. 
The awards honor excellence and innovation 
in oil and gas from North Texas to the Per-
mian Basin and for the first time, this award 
included the category of renewable energy. In 
addition to the designation for the annual En-
ergy Awards, D CEQ magazine also named 
John Billingsley to its recently announced Dal-
las 500 list. The list—now in its 7th year—fea-
tures the Dallas/Fort Worth region’s most influ-
ential leaders in more than 50 different indus-
try categories. 
Tri Global Energy is a Dallas-based origi-
nator and developer of utility-scale renewable 
energy projects including wind, solar, and en-
ergy storage. Founded over 12 years ago by 
Billingsley, the company today is the largest 
wind power developer in Texas (the state that 
leads the U.S. in wind development), and a 
top 10 developer of wind power nationally. In 
Texas alone, Tri Global Energy renewable en-
ergy projects represent over $800 million in 
taxes and royalties to local communities, $105 
million in payments to landowners and inves-
tors, and $6.8 billion in capital investments 
projected over 30 years. 
Billingsley, a West Texas native and Texas 
Tech University graduate, has founded and 
operated more than 20 businesses in indus-
tries as diverse as accounting and banking to 
agriculture, real estate, and manufacturing. He 
founded Tri Global Energy based on a busi-
ness model of involving local landowners and 
communities in wind power projects, and he 
has led the company through more than a 
decade of growth and expansion. 
I want to express my appreciation and best 
wishes to John Billingsley upon his impressive 
recognitions by D CEO magazine. North 
Texas was built by visionary leaders and en-
trepreneurs like Billingsley and we are proud 
that he has chosen the 24th Congressional 
District as his company headquarters.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM 
PETRY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to one of Eastern 
Kentucky’s fallen heroes, William Edward 
Petry, a 31-year law enforcement veteran who 
was 1 of 3 officers killed in the line of duty in 
Allen, Kentucky. 
Petry served 14 years with the Prestonsburg 
Police Department and 15 years with Ken-
tucky State Police, earning the prestigious 
Post 9 Trooper of the Year Award. Not long 
after his retirement, Petry was eager to con-
tinue his lifelong passion to serve and protect 
his community, leading him to the Floyd Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office where he dedicated his final 
two years of service. The best law enforce-
ment officers will tell you that it isn’t a job, it’s 
a calling; and it was with great courage of 
conviction that Deputy Petry lived to protect 
the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, 
and especially those in Floyd County. 
President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a 
former commissioner of the New York City Po-
lice Department once said, ‘‘No man is worth 
his salt, who is not ready at all times to risk 
his body, to risk his well-being, to risk his life 
in a great cause.’’ On Thursday, June 30, 
2022, Deputy Petry was the first officer to pay 
the ultimate sacrifice as he valiantly answered 
the call of duty to protect others in Floyd 
County. 
His heroic death was the greatest display of 
love described in John 15:13, ‘‘Greater love 
has no man than this: to lay down his life for 
his friends.’’ 
In a Nation where police forces have been 
vilified in recent years by the actions of a few 
bad actors, may Deputy Petry’s life be a re-
minder of the outstanding integrity and sac-
rifice that the thin blue line represents. We 
must continue to support our law enforcement 
officers across the United States, ensuring 
they are fully equipped, adequately prepared, 
and never at the mercy of evildoers. 
Petry’s entire life was dedicated to serving 
others, and not only with a police badge. He 
was also the current Fire Chief for the Martin 
Fire Department, a member of John W. Hall 
Mason Lodge No. 950 where he was Past 
Master, and a member of the Oleika Shriners 
Temple in Lexington, Kentucky. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky owes a 
great debt of gratitude for the life and service 
of Deputy William Petry. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his wife Sherry, their son 
Chase, daughter Courtney (Shane), their 
grandchildren, and the widespread band of 
brothers and sisters in uniform who served 
alongside Deputy Petry throughout his career.

CONGRATULATING 
SCHUYLERVILLE BASEBALL ON 
THEIR STATE FINALS RUN 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Schuylerville baseball on 
their excellent season culminating in a New 
York state championship game. This was the 
second consecutive state finals appearance by 
the Dark Horses after the last two seasons 
were canceled due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
The Schuylerville Dark Horses showed great 
resilience and determination throughout their 
state finals run. They started the year with six 
early losses but turned their season around 
and won nine consecutive games on their way 
to the finals. In the semifinals, the Dark 
Horses found themselves down two to nothing 
in the second inning. They fought hard and 
climbed their way back to victory over Maine- 
Endwell High School. In this game, senior 
pitcher Ryan Dow gave up only seven hits, 
struck out five batters, and drove in a run in 
the fourth inning. 
In the state championship game against 
Spackenkill, Schuylerville again found them-
selves in a position where they needed to fight 
their way back, trailing four to one in the mid-
dle of the game. The Schuylerville team, as 
they have done all season long, showed great 
resilience by tying the game up in the fifth and 
holding on to force extra innings. Carson Pat-
rick, a Schuylerville senior, contributed to this 
comeback with a triple that drove in two runs. 
Though they eventually fell six to four in the 
eighth inning, this Schuylerville team fought to 
the very end. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, it is 
my honor to recognize the great accomplish-
ments of the Schuylerville baseball team. We 
are very proud of the Dark Horses for their 
hard work and dedication, and we can’t wait to 
see what they accomplish in the future.

HONORING PAUL SWEIGERT, M.D. 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Paul Sweigert, 
M.D. in celebration of his outstanding medical 
career in Napa County. 
Dr. Sweigert was born and raised in Sac-
ramento, California, and graduated from Jesuit 
High School in Carmichael. He received a 
bachelor’s degree in physical therapy in 1981 
from California State University, Fresno. He 
then 
graduated 
from 
Dartmouth 
Medical 
School in 1990 with a Doctor of Medicine. 
Dr. Sweigert began his medical career at 
the Providence Medical Center in Portland, 
Oregon, studying internal medicine from 1990 
to 1993. He then moved to Bath, Maine, to 
practice as a primary care physician. In 1997, 
Dr. Sweigert moved to Napa, where he joined 
the medical staff of the Queen of the Valley 
Medical Center. While working at the Queen 
of the Valley Medical Center, he also took 
over the practice of Dr. Alvin Lee Block in 
1998 and launched Red Bike Medicine as a 
solo practitioner in 2014. He is revered in 
Napa County for his excellent medical care, 
hard work, and kind nature. 
Dr. Sweigert has been a devoted member of 
the Napa Solano Medical Society (NSMS) and 
the California Medical Association (CMA) for 
25 years. He was a CMA delegate from 2006 
to 2012, NSMS president from 2007 to 2008, 
and a hospital representative to CMA’s Orga-
nized Medical Staff Section from 2009 to 
2013. On May 2, 2022, Dr. Sweigert received 
the Napa Solano Medical Society Professor 
Emeritus award in appreciation of his long and 
illustrious career as a physician, teacher, and 
friend. 
In his free time, Dr. Sweigert enjoys trav-
eling, gardening, bicycling, serving his commu-
nity, and spending time with his family. Dr. 
Sweigert has held numerous community-re-
lated roles, including being a local soccer 
coach, a Board of Trustees member for Justin 
Sienna High School, and a member of the
