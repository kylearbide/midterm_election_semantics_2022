PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Holy, holy, holy Lord, fill the Earth 
with the knowledge of Your glory. As 
the waters cover the sea, the stars in-
habit the celestial heavens, the birds 
fill the air with their song, the majesty 
of the animals roam the forest and 
plains, so may Your sovereign presence 
reign in our lives, in this place, and in 
our Nation. 
Lift up our eyes to the hills that we 
may discover from whence our help 
does come. You who made Heaven and 
Earth, speak Your creative word into 
our discourse, Your compassion into 
our engagements with one another. 
Lord, You are our keeper, You watch 
over us so that the harshness of the 
day will not overtake us, the dark of 
the night will not overwhelm us. 
Keep us, then, from all harm. Guard 
our comings and goings within Your 
eternal grace plan that we may live to 
sing of Your praises and accomplish 
the work You set before us. 
In Your merciful name we pray and 
by Your grace we live. 
Amen.

CONGRATULATING 
MARK 
FLEGENHEIMER ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to recognize a longtime leader in 
our community, Mark Flegenheimer, 
as he retires from Michigan Sugar. 
Mark has been in the sugar industry 
for 40 years. He first started with 
Michigan Sugar in 1994 before quickly 
moving up to become president and 
CEO in 1998, where he succeeded his fa-
ther. 
At one point, the sugar beet industry 
was on the brink of collapse in Michi-
gan, a fate that many other commu-
nities across the country suffered, but 
through Mark’s leadership and the de-
termination of the beet growers and 
those who work with him, they got 
through these really difficult times. 
During Mark’s tenure, in fact, Michi-
gan Sugar has doubled its output while 
using 40 percent less energy to save 
costs and to protect the environment. 
In mid-Michigan, we have thousands 
of family farms, including sugar beet 
growers. Every day they work with and 
depend on Michigan Sugar, and so we 
thank Mark for all he has done over 
the years. 
Mark is not only a great businessman 
but also a really good guy, a great part 
of our community. He volunteers his 
time as a member of the Delta College 
Foundation board of directors and as 
vice chairman of the board at the Mid-
land Center for the Arts. 
Mark, thank you for your dedication 
to mid-Michigan, and congratulations 
on your retirement.

SMITH FAMILY CELEBRATING 400 
YEARS IN AMERICA 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the Smith family ahead of their 
400th anniversary of arriving to the 
United States. 
In 
1622, 
William 
Smith 
traveled 
across the ocean from England and 
made landfall just north of Plymouth. 
Mr. Smith, like so many of the original 
Pilgrims, left England in search of a 
new life as a result of religious persecu-
tion. Being Methodist in a mostly Puri-
tan colony meant he and his family 
were considered strangers and out-
siders in their English community. 
The Smith family eventually made 
their way to Jefferson County, Penn-
sylvania, in 1816, which they have now 
called home for more than 200 years. 
Madam Speaker, this weekend, the 
Smith family will gather in Clarion, 
Pennsylvania, to mark 400 years in the 
United States in the form of a family 
reunion. 
Their 
uniquely 
American 
story deserves to be celebrated, and I 
want to extend my sincerest congratu-
lations to the Smith family for their 
longstanding history in the United 
States. 
f 
LET’S REPAIR THE WORLD 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, we all 
feel horror, sadness, and anger as we 
learn more about the horrific shooting 
in Uvalde, Texas, and the police offi-
cers’ lack of response. 
I wondered, what were they afraid of? 
One part of the answer is clear: semi-
automatic weapons. 
For the sake of us all, we must pass 
the assault weapons ban, just as we did 
in 1994. 
Let us remember, the ban was backed 
by three former Presidents: Gerald 
Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan. 
And it was supported by police leader-
ship then as it is today. 
Republicans in 1994 had the courage 
to stand up to the gun lobby, and yet 
Republicans in 2022 cannot find such 
courage. I don’t know why. Instead, 
they blame DAs and mayors and really 
anyone but themselves, ourselves. 
We are Members of Congress with the 
power to ban weapons that civilians 
are using to murder neighbors, strang-
ers, children, and even police officers. 
No more decapitated children. 
No more slaughtered shoppers or pa-
rade goers. 
Let us find the courage to act. 
Tikkun olam, as the Jewish tradition 
teaches. Let us repair the world. 
f 
VETERANS-TO-CLASSROOMS 
PROGRAM 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the much-needed 
pay raise for our military, passed yes-
terday in a bill that provides critical 
resources to confront the national se-
curity threats from China and from 
Russia. 
I would also like to highlight one of 
my 
amendments. 
Simply 
put, 
my 
amendment provides funding to help 
veterans pursue careers in education— 
as teachers and as school resource offi-
cers. 
The House passage of this amend-
ment is a win for everyone: 
For veterans who want to pursue a 
career in education. 
For schools who need more qualified 
teachers and resource officers. 
And for students who will be able to 
learn from worthy role models about 
service, sacrifice and patriotism. 
The Veterans-to-Classrooms program 
will be an excellent opportunity for 
veterans to continue to serve our coun-
try. 
f 
SAFEGUARDING WOMEN’S RIGHTS 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, in 
the Supreme Court decision to over-
turn Roe v. Wade, Justice Thomas 
wrote an alarming concurring opinion 
explicitly calling for the reconsider-
ation of the constitutional right to 
contraception. 
Republican State lawmakers have at-
tempted to restrict birth control for 
years, and this concurring opinion 
serves as a rallying call to escalate at-
tacks on access to contraceptives. 
I will not stand idly by and watch ex-
treme politicians obstruct women’s pri-
vate healthcare choices and diminish 
reproductive freedom. Access to birth 
control is key to achieving gender 
equality, improving health outcomes 
for women, bolstering educational and 
economic opportunities for all, and en-
suring people are in control of their 
family planning. 
That is why this week I introduced 
the Right to Contraception Act. My 
bill would codify the right to access 
birth control into Federal law and put 
a stop to violations of Americans’ right 
to 
this 
essential 
reproductive 
healthcare. 
I urgently ask my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support my legisla-
tion to protect birth control and safe-
guard women’s right to make their de-
cisions about their own bodies and fu-
tures. 
f 
REMEMBERING ARTEZ BENTON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
the life of a young man from my alma 
mater, Artez Benton. 
A talented baseball player at Young 
Harris College, Artez tragically lost his 
life this past month while in Atlanta. 
Born in Scottdale, Georgia, Artez 
was a star on the Druid Hills High 
School baseball team. He chose to con-
tinue his athletic career at Young Har-
ris as an infielder for the Mountain 
Lions. 
Artez was wise beyond his years, 
hardworking, and was working to be-
come 
a 
certified 
electrician 
with 
dreams of owning his own home. He 
would begin his days at 4:00 in the 
morning, studying for his apprentice-
ship, and despite his busy and long 
days, Artez was sure to make time to 
help his father with his landscaping 
company and to teach his young neph-
ew the sport he loved so dearly. 
This tragedy has rocked the Young 
Harris community and has stolen a 
bright future from a young man and 
his family. My heart aches for the Ben-
ton family, and my prayers reside with 
them in this terribly difficult time. 
f 
ABORTION RIGHTS MUST BE 
CODIFIED 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, 1973 Roe is de-
cided. From that day forward, Repub-
licans have been desperate to overturn 
it. Twenty-one days ago, a rightwing 
majority on the Supreme Court over-
turned Roe v. Wade. 
Make no mistake, these rightwing 
extremists are not pro-life, but pro- 
controlling the bodies of women, girls, 
and anyone who can become pregnant. 
Abortion is now illegal in 16 States, 
and anti-abortion legislators are fol-
lowing suit, threatening to make abor-
tion inaccessible for roughly 33 million 
women across America. And they are 
not done. Republicans have been clear 
they will not stop until abortion is 
banned nationwide. 
Later today, the House will pass an 
updated version of the Women’s Health 
Protection Act, which would establish 
a Federal statutory right to abortion. 
The Senate must follow suit and abol-
ish the filibuster, and we must secure 
pro-choice majorities in the House and 
Senate. Our lives depend upon it.

MEXICAN CARTELS GROWING 
MARIJUANA IN CALIFORNIA 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden administration’s open border 
policies are wreaking havoc across our 
Nation, causing crime to spike, even in 
my home district in northern Cali-
fornia.

nificent, forested wildlands, Mexican

cartels are using our porous borders as 
easy access to Federal lands to grow il-
legal marijuana crops. 
Even though cannabis products are 
legal under California law, truly they 
are still illegal under Federal law. 
These illegal grows are dangerous and 
cause irreversible harm to the land-
scape and animals. 
These grows are guarded by dan-
gerous cartel members with illegal 
weapons that they smuggle across the 
border. This puts local residents, for-
esters, and outdoor recreationists at 
grave risk if they accidentally come 
across or near a grow. 
Butte County in northern California, 
my home county, is designated now as 
a Federal high-intensity drug traf-
ficking area. Thanks a lot. 
These illegal farmers use toxic pes-
ticides that are outlawed by the U.S. 
and unavailable to American growers 
anymore. These chemicals run off into 
nearby water sources, poisoning the 
animals and killing off plant life. They 
cut off water from other farmers and 
rivers and cause much damage to the 
environment. 
This 
drug 
trafficking 
must 
be 
stopped. 
f 
WE CANNOT GO BACK 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in outrage at the cruel at-
tacks 
extreme 
Republicans 
have 
launched on women and their rights. 
Because of these MAGA Republicans, 
our daughters will have less freedom 
than their mothers for the first time in 
American history. 
This has been their plan all along. As 
this graphic behind me shows, women 
have been fighting Republican attacks 
for decades, and it has been a tough 
fight. But House Democrats won’t give 
up. We cannot go back. We won’t give 
up because we trust women. 
Today, we will pass two bills to pro-
tect women, their rights, and their 
freedoms—the Ensuring Women’s Right 
to Reproductive Freedom Act and the 
Women’s Health Protection Act—for 
the second time. 
Democrats are the party that stand 
with women. Without them, we cannot 
be a better America. We always have 
and always will be with women. We 
trust women.

MORE SPENDING IS NOT THE 
SOLUTION FOR INFLATION 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, con-
sumer prices climbed another 1.3 per-
cent last month, bringing the Nation’s 
total annual rate of inflation to 9.1 per-
cent. The cost of making goods shot 
up, too. The producer price index hit a 
whopping 11.3 percent. It is costing 
Tennesseans and all American families 
an extra $5,000 a year. 
There seems to be a growing con-
sensus that we are heading toward a re-
cession. I continue to believe that it 
didn’t have to be this way. The Fed 
wouldn’t have to raise interest rates 
had President Biden and Congressional 
Democrats resisted the urge to borrow 
and spend trillions and trillions of dol-
lars we did not have and couldn’t afford 
to spend. 
What is their solution for getting us 
out of this mess? Even more spending. 
But only increasing domestic produc-
tion of our natural energy resources 
can get us back on track. President 
Biden appears to prefer the destruction 
of our country’s fossil fuel energy in-
dustry rather than using it to bring the 
price of gasoline and diesel back down.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will

FORMULA ACT 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass

egon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) and the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The news about supply chain disrup-
tions have filled the news, but none is 
more compelling and urgent for com-
munities across America than facing 
challenges due to the infant formula 
shortage. This is an urgent issue for 
our families. 
Between supply chain issues due to 
the pandemic and the closure of a 
Michigan infant formula plant, out-of- 
stock rates have reached perilous lev-
els. The out-of-stock rate was 31 per-
cent in mid-April and rose to 90 percent 
in 10 States by the end of May. In my 
State, Oregon, we faced an out-of-stock 
rate higher than 85 percent. 
While these numbers alone tell a hor-
rific story, there is no number that can 
capture the fear and frustration felt by 
families who are searching for formula 
to serve their babies. As a parent and 
grandparent, I can assure you that 
there is nothing as anxiety- and anger-

inducing as not being able to properly 
care for your child. 
I have heard stories of families going 
store to store or posting on social 
media asking for help as they try to 
find the formula their family needs. 
Families have enough to worry about 
without worrying about how to feed 
their baby. 
The Federal Government must pro-
vide the support needed to help these 
children and families and explore every 
possible option. This administration 
and Congress has made significant 
progress by invoking the Defense Pro-
duction Act, increasing flexibility for 
the WIC program, and easing restric-
tions on imports to fill supply chain 
shortages. 
While the FDA has exercised enforce-
ment discretion to increase imports, 
imported infant formula remains sub-
ject to high tariffs. These tariffs, which 
increase the cost of the formula im-
ports by an estimated 27 percent, only 
exaggerate the suffering families face 
at this time. 
It 
is 
unacceptable 
that 
families 
would be taxed on a product that they 
need and have no other way of getting 
in the midst of this crisis. Our Ways 
and Means Trade Subcommittee is 
committed to leveraging our jurisdic-
tion to reduce these costs. 
I especially appreciate my colleague 
SUZAN
DELBENE
for her partnership 
and leadership on this legislation. She 
was integral to this effort, and we 
wouldn’t be here today without her. 
The Formula Act reaffirms Congress’ 
constitutional authority to regulate 
commerce from foreign nations by 
temporarily suspending tariffs on im-
ported infant formula through the end 
of this year. This change should help 
make formula more affordable and ac-
cessible to families in every State. 
I am grateful for the support of 
Chairman 
NEAL; 
Ranking 
Member 
BRADY; Ranking Member SMITH, who is 
managing the bill for the Republicans; 
and the Ways and Means Committee in 
bringing this bipartisan legislation to 
the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
8351, the Formula Act. 
I appreciate Mr. BLUMENAUER and his 
willingness to work with me on this bi-
partisan effort to address our Nation’s 
infant formula shortage. 
The Formula Act makes infant for-
mula more accessible and affordable by 
allowing it to be imported duty-free 
through the end of the year. 
Make no mistake: Mothers and fami-
lies should never have to experience 
the extreme despair of worrying wheth-
er shelves will be stocked with the for-
mula they need for their infants. 
As a father of two, including a 1- 
year-old, I think I can speak for many 
others across America that nothing is 
more important than the health and 
well-being of our children. 
The Biden administration knew of 
the looming infant formula shortage 
for months and yet failed to develop a 
strategy or adequately respond. While 
we wait for domestic production to 
fully resume, families should not have 
to pay additional taxes on imported 
formula to feed their little ones. 
I will continue to work with my col-
leagues on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, as well as the full House, to use 
trade tools to strengthen critical sup-
ply chains like infant formula. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from Washington 
(Ms. DELBENE), a committee member 
and a leader on this issue. 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the ongoing baby for-
mula crisis and urge my colleagues to 
support the Formula Act. 
I raised two kids, and I know the first 
months of parenthood are tiring and 
stressful, even in the best of situations. 
Now, families across the country are 
in a dire position as they try to find 
the formula that they need to feed 
their babies. 
Around the country, 74 percent of for-
mula shelves are empty. In my home 
State of Washington, we are one of 10 
States where over 90 percent of shelves 
are empty. 
Severely stretched supply chains and 
a major formula plant going offline 
have left shelves barren. Unreliable 
formula supply is a critical problem for 
families. Parents are driving hours to 
multiple different stores just to find 
any formula, and that is time that par-
ents don’t have. 
Changing formulas constantly is also 
disruptive to babies. It causes digestive 
problems and excessive crying. 
Jessie, a mom in my district, has 
been struggling to find formula for her 
infant daughter, Amara. She is not one 
to ask for help, but when she was run-
ning low on her last can, Jessie joined 
a local social media group where other 
parents would post where they saw for-
mula on shelves, and she downloaded 
an app that would notify her when 
more cans were available. Jessie was 
able to find formula, but she realizes 
that she is one of the lucky parents 
who had the means, the time, and the 
network to support Amara. 
By removing tariffs on foreign for-
mula that meets FDA’s safety stand-
ards, the Formula Act will make it 
easier and more affordable for parents 
to feed their babies so fewer are finding 
themselves in this difficult situation. 
This is a commonsense solution, so 
let’s make it happen. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY), a member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8351, the Formula Act. 
I thank my friend from Nebraska, 
Mr. ADRIAN
SMITH, and Mr. BLU-
MENAUER for their leadership on this 
bill. 
With families facing record-high in-
flation, with record-high food and gas 
prices, the last thing that parents need 
to worry about is being able to find for-
mula, much less being able then to af-
ford it. 
H.R. 8351 ensures that families are 
not covering the cost of additional 
taxes on formula imported into the 
United States, and I am pleased with 
the relief that this bill will provide. 
But, unfortunately, as has been the 
mantra of this administration, this cri-
sis exemplifies just another self-in-
flicted wound that has been the point 
of the Biden administration. The ad-
ministration knew about the impend-
ing shortage and failed to act to avert 
the crisis. 
The incompetence of this administra-
tion has real world effects. We are talk-
ing about something that is basic sus-
tenance for infants in this country. 
They need this, and this bill will help 
bring affordability to parents for their 
children. 
Madam Speaker, I thank, again, my 
colleagues and encourage their support 
of this legislation. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE), a senior 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this legislation to lower 
prices for families I represent in mid- 
Michigan, and I thank Chairman BLU-
MENAUER for his leadership on this very 
important issue. 
Production of infant formula in this 
country isn’t working properly. It is 
not getting to the shelves, and it is de-
nying families what they need at the 
most important time in the develop-
ment of the life of a child. After prod-
uct recalls, corporate consolidations, 
and obviously pandemic-related supply 
chain issues, this is a real struggle for 
American families. 
As parents raising three kids, my 
wife and I empathize with those anx-
ious parents out there who are strug-
gling to find formula for their newborn 
children. That is why Congress has to 
act to increase imports of formula 
until domestic production can get back 
to the point where we can supply our 
domestic needs with our own produc-
tion capacity. 
However, as has been said, some for-
mula imports are still subject to really 
high tariffs, up to 27 percent, and there 
is no reason at this moment that 
American families who are struggling 
should have to pay that additional 
cost. They shouldn’t have to pay more 
for something that is absolutely nec-
essary for their children. 
That is why we introduced this legis-
lation, supported by Republicans and 
Democrats, to suspend these formula 
import tariffs for the rest of the year 
and to lower costs for families with 
children. I really do urge my col-
leagues, all of us, to join. This is some-
thing we ought to be able to do to-
gether to immediately reduce prices

for families who have needs, for fami-
lies with small children, to make sure 
that until we can get our domestic pro-
duction back online, we can supply 
what we need at a cost that is afford-
able to those families that are simply 
trying to take care of their kids. That 
is our obligation. That is why we swore 
the oath to come here and do this 
work. We have the tools in our hands 
to get this done. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in 
this effort. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman, Mr. BLU-
MENAUER, for his leadership and his co-
sponsor from Nebraska for his leader-
ship. 
Ninety percent of the stores in Hous-
ton are without baby formula. Texas 
was one of the hardest hit States. One 
of the most potent, powerful, and sad 
days was when I was able to find baby 
formula from a disaster organization, 
and in my district, in those early days, 
had a baby formula giveaway. Volun-
teers were looking to make sure that 
we were not giving out expired-date 
formula. All I can say is the lines of 
cars and the women who stopped to get 
out of the car to simply hug us, the 
strollers that came up—baby formula 
is a lifeline. 
b 0930 
Baby formula is a lifeline. This legis-
lation breaks the crisis of the supply 
chain and provides a regulatory scheme 
that ensures we can have production. 
The disappointing aspect of all of 
this is the shutdown of the center point 
of manufacturing, if you will, and 
many were not notified. This legisla-
tion says that we are committed as 
Members of the United States Congress 
to modify safety requirements to the 
extent that no formula is jeopardized 
but that the lifeline for babies is our 
first priority. 
I am grateful for this legislation be-
cause the shelves in Houston, Texas, 
are gradually coming back. They are 
not there yet. Just a few weeks ago, we 
had one of the largest cargo planes 
land at Bush Intercontinental Airport. 
The gratification of families was un-
speakable, could not be mentioned. 
This cannot ever happen again. It is 
important for Congress to be advanced 
and prepared to ensure that babies, 
who are innocent and without the abil-
ity to speak, are taken care of. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. BLU-
MENAUER for this kind of leadership. 
Thank God relief is on the way. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I appreciate the dialogue that we 
have been having here today. I think it 
is important, as my colleague just 
mentioned, that we work together to 
make sure this doesn’t happen again. 
I think we need to look across the 
Federal agencies to make sure that 
these very powerful agencies that have 
the power to shut down an industry, 
perhaps, that they have to plan ahead 
for what happens if that occurs so that 
people don’t suffer as a result. 
When we hear the statistics that 90 
percent of stores didn’t have some-
thing, that means they had none, not 
just more expensive product that we 
see across the economy. It is hard to 
believe that the inflation rate is an-
nounced at 9.1 percent when it sure 
seems like things are a lot more expen-
sive than just 9.1 percent more than 
last year. 
The fact of the matter is, let’s work 
together to prevent this formula situa-
tion from ever happening again. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I appreciate the partnership with my 
good friend, Mr. SMITH. We have been 
able to move this expeditiously. I do 
appreciate his observation that there 
are challenges that we meet, and we 
would hope that our government and 
the various agencies that are involved 
are able to respond quickly. That, of 
course, is something that we need to 
empower them to do, these partner-
ships. 
Sometimes there is a little tension 
about the role and nature of govern-
ment agencies, but this is an example, 
admittedly, where we want to get 
ahead of the curve, and the powers that 
agencies have can be used construc-
tively. 
I am pleased that our committee, for 
example, sprang into action dealing 
with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia 
to suspend tariff advantages for Russia, 
and we moved that quickly on a bipar-
tisan basis. Particularly in this case we 
have 26 members of the Ways and 
Means Committee who are cospon-
soring this legislation, and it was able 
to move quickly. 
Unlike what often happens with 
things we pass in the House that linger 
in the Senate, it looks like the Senate 
is poised to be able to act quickly in re-
sponse to our action here today. 
So I hope we come together. I hope 
we have a unanimous vote that would 
suspend this 27 percent additional cost 
on families struggling to meet the 
needs of their children. I hope that we 
can continue to look at areas where we 
need to refine tools to make sure that 
things like this don’t happen again and 
we work together to try to hit the 
right balance. 
In the meantime, I think we have hit 
the right balance with this legislation. 
I appreciate the partnership, and I look 
forward to its passage today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I am finished, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8351. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT OF 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 1224, I call 
up the bill (H.R. 8296) to protect a per-
son’s ability to determine whether to 
continue or end a pregnancy, and to 
protect a health care provider’s ability 
to provide abortion services, and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8296 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s 
Health Protection Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs 
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 
the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, 
reversing decades of precedent recognizing 
the constitutional right to terminate a preg-
nancy before fetal viability, and to termi-
nate a pregnancy after fetal viability where 
it is necessary, in the good-faith medical 
judgment of the treating health care profes-
sional, for the preservation of the life or 
health of the person who is pregnant. 
(2) In their joint dissent, Justices Breyer, 
Sotomayor, and Kagan write, ‘‘[The major-
ity] says that from the very moment of fer-
tilization, a woman has no rights to speak 
of. A State can force her to bring a preg-
nancy to term, even at the steepest personal 
and familial costs.’’. 
(3) The dissenting Justices continue, ‘‘The 
Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions 
after the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the 
majority’s ruling, though, another State’s 
law could do so after ten weeks, or five or 
three or one—or, again, from the moment of 
fertilization. States have already passed 
such laws, in anticipation of today’s ruling. 
More will follow.’’. 
(4) The dissenting Justices also stated, 
‘‘one result of [the] decision is certain; the 
curtailment of women’s rights, and of their 
status as free and equal citizens.’’. 
(5) Indeed, some States acted to ban abor-
tion outright in the immediate aftermath of 
the Dobbs decision, with half the States in 
the country expected to ban abortion en-
tirely in the days and weeks to come. 
(6) Even before Roe was overturned, access 
to abortion services had been obstructed 
across the United States in various ways, in-
cluding blockades of health care facilities

and associated violence, prohibitions of, and 
restrictions on, insurance coverage; parental 
involvement laws (notification and consent); 
restrictions that shame and stigmatize peo-
ple seeking abortion services; and medically 
unnecessary regulations that neither confer 
any health benefit nor further the safety of 
abortion services, but which harm people by 
delaying, complicating access to, and reduc-
ing the availability of, abortion services. 
(7) Abortion services are essential to 
health care, and access to those services is 
central to people’s ability to participate 
equally in the economic and social life of the 
United States. Abortion access allows people 
who are pregnant to make their own deci-
sions about their pregnancies, their families, 
and their lives. 
(8) Reproductive justice requires every in-
dividual to have the right to make their own 
decisions about having children regardless of 
their 
circumstances 
and 
without 
inter-
ference and discrimination. Reproductive 
Justice is a human right that can and will be 
achieved when all people, regardless of ac-
tual or perceived race, color, national origin, 
immigration status, sex (including gender 
identity, sex stereotyping, or sexual orienta-
tion), age, or disability status have the eco-
nomic, social, and political power and re-
sources to define and make decisions about 
their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and 
communities in all areas of their lives, with 
dignity and self-determination. 
(9) Reproductive justice seeks to address 
restrictions on reproductive health, includ-
ing abortion, that perpetuate systems of op-
pression, lack of bodily autonomy, white su-
premacy, and anti-Black racism. This vio-
lent legacy has manifested in policies includ-
ing enslavement, rape, and experimentation 
on Black women; forced sterilizations; med-
ical experimentation on low-income women’s 
reproductive systems; and the forcible re-
moval of Indigenous children. Access to equi-
table reproductive health care, including 
abortion services, has always been deficient 
in the United States for Black, Indigenous, 
and other People of Color (BIPOC) and their 
families. 
(10) The legacy of restrictions on reproduc-
tive health, rights, and justice is not a dated 
vestige of a dark history. Presently, the 
harms of abortion-specific restrictions fall 
especially heavily on people with low in-
comes, BIPOC, immigrants, young people, 
people with disabilities, and those living in 
rural and other medically underserved areas. 
Abortion-specific restrictions are even more 
compounded by the ongoing criminalization 
of people who are pregnant, including those 
who are incarcerated, living with HIV, or 
with substance-use disorders. These commu-
nities already experience health disparities 
due to social, political, and environmental 
inequities, and restrictions on abortion serv-
ices 
exacerbate 
these 
harms. 
Removing 
medically unjustified restrictions on abor-
tion services would constitute one important 
step on the path toward realizing Reproduc-
tive Justice by ensuring that the full range 
of reproductive health care is accessible to 
all who need it. 
(11) Abortion-specific restrictions are a 
tool of gender oppression, as they target 
health care services that are used primarily 
by women. These paternalistic restrictions 
rely on and reinforce harmful stereotypes 
about gender roles, women’s decision-mak-
ing, and women’s need for protection instead 
of support, undermining their ability to con-
trol their own lives and well-being. These re-
strictions harm the basic autonomy, dignity, 
and equality of women, and their ability to 
participate in the social and economic life of 
the Nation. 
(12) The terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘women’’ are 
used in this bill to reflect the identity of the 
majority of people targeted and affected by 
restrictions on abortion services, and to ad-
dress squarely the targeted restrictions on 
abortion, which are rooted in misogyny. 
However, access to abortion services is crit-
ical to the health of every person capable of 
becoming pregnant. This Act is intended to 
protect all people with the capacity for preg-
nancy—cisgender women, transgender men, 
non-binary individuals, those who identify 
with a different gender, and others—who are 
unjustly harmed by restrictions on abortion 
services. 
(13) Since 2011, States and local govern-
ments have passed nearly 500 restrictions 
singling out health care providers who offer 
abortion services, interfering with their abil-
ity to provide those services and the pa-
tients’ ability to obtain those services. 
(14) Many State and local governments 
have imposed restrictions on the provision of 
abortion services that are neither evidence- 
based nor generally applicable to the med-
ical profession or to other medically com-
parable outpatient gynecological procedures, 
such as endometrial ablations, dilation and 
curettage for reasons other than abortion, 
hysteroscopies, loop electrosurgical excision 
procedures, or other analogous non-gyneco-
logical procedures performed in similar out-
patient 
settings 
including 
vasectomy, 
sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. 
(15) Abortion is essential health care and 
one of the safest medical procedures in the 
United States. An independent, comprehen-
sive review of the state of science on the 
safety and quality of abortion services, pub-
lished 
by 
the 
National 
Academies 
of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018, 
found that abortion in the United States is 
safe and effective and that the biggest 
threats to the quality of abortion services in 
the United States are State regulations that 
create barriers to care. These abortion-spe-
cific 
restrictions 
conflict 
with 
medical 
standards and are not supported by the rec-
ommendations and guidelines issued by lead-
ing reproductive health care professional or-
ganizations including the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Soci-
ety of Family Planning, the National Abor-
tion Federation, the World Health Organiza-
tion, and others. 
(16) Many abortion-specific restrictions do 
not confer any health or safety benefits on 
the patient. Instead, these restrictions have 
the purpose and effect of unduly burdening 
people’s personal and private medical deci-
sions to end their pregnancies by making ac-
cess to abortion services more difficult, 
invasive, and costly, often forcing people to 
travel significant distances and make mul-
tiple unnecessary visits to the provider, and 
in some cases, foreclosing the option alto-
gether. For example, a 2018 report from the 
University of California San Francisco’s Ad-
vancing New Standards in Reproductive 
Health research group found that in 27 cities 
across the United States, people have to 
travel more than 100 miles in any direction 
to reach an abortion provider. 
(17) An overwhelming majority of abor-
tions in the United States are provided in 
clinics, not hospitals, but the large majority 
of counties throughout the United States 
have no clinics that provide abortion. 
(18) These restrictions additionally harm 
people’s health by reducing access not only 
to abortion services but also to other essen-
tial health care services offered by many of 
the providers targeted by the restrictions, 
including— 
(A) screenings and preventive services, in-
cluding contraceptive services; 
(B) testing and treatment for sexually 
transmitted infections; 
(C) LGBTQ health services; and 
(D) referrals for primary care, intimate 
partner violence prevention, prenatal care 
and adoption services. 
(19) The cumulative effect of these numer-
ous restrictions has been to severely limit, 
and now eliminate entirely, the availability 
of abortion services in some areas, creating a 
patchwork system where the provision of 
abortion services is legal in some States and 
illegal in others. A 2019 report from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office examining 
State Medicaid compliance with abortion 
coverage requirements analyzed seven key 
challenges (identified both by health care 
providers and research literature) and their 
effect on abortion access, and found that ac-
cess to abortion services varied across the 
States and even within a State. 
(20) International human rights law recog-
nizes that access to abortion is intrinsically 
linked to the rights to life, health, equality 
and non-discrimination, privacy, and free-
dom from ill-treatment. United Nations (UN) 
human rights treaty monitoring bodies have 
found that legal abortion services, like other 
reproductive health care services, must be 
available, accessible, affordable, acceptable, 
and of good quality. UN human rights treaty 
bodies have likewise condemned medically 
unnecessary barriers to abortion services, in-
cluding mandatory waiting periods, biased 
counseling requirements, and third-party au-
thorization requirements. 
(21) Core human rights treaties ratified by 
the United States protect access to abortion. 
For example, in 2018, the UN Human Rights 
Committee, which oversees implementation 
of the ICCPR, made clear that the right to 
life, enshrined in Article 6 of the ICCPR, at 
a minimum requires governments to provide 
safe, legal, and effective access to abortion 
where a person’s life and health is at risk, or 
when carrying a pregnancy to term would 
cause substantial pain or suffering. The 
Committee stated that governments must 
not impose restrictions on abortion which 
subject women and girls to physical or men-
tal pain or suffering, discriminate against 
them, arbitrarily interfere with their pri-
vacy, or place them at risk of undertaking 
unsafe abortions. Furthermore, the Com-
mittee stated that governments should re-
move existing barriers that deny effective 
access to safe and legal abortion, refrain 
from introducing new barriers to abortion, 
and prevent the stigmatization of those 
seeking abortion. 
(22) UN independent human rights experts 
have expressed particular concern about bar-
riers to abortion services in the United 
States. For example, at the conclusion of his 
2017 visit to the United States, the UN Spe-
cial Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights noted concern that low-income 
women face legal and practical obstacles to 
exercising their constitutional right to ac-
cess abortion services, trapping many women 
in cycles of poverty. Similarly, in May 2020, 
the UN Working Group on discrimination 
against women and girls, along with other 
human rights experts, expressed concern 
that some states had manipulated the 
COVID–19 crisis to restrict access to abor-
tion, which the experts recognized as ‘‘the 
latest example illustrating a pattern of re-
strictions and retrogressions in access to 
legal abortion care across the country’’ and 
reminded U.S. authorities that abortion care 
constitutes essential health care that must 
remain available during and after the pan-
demic. They noted that barriers to abortion 
access exacerbate systemic inequalities and 
cause particular harm to marginalized com-
munities, including low-income people, peo-
ple of color, immigrants, people with disabil-
ities, and LGBTQ people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6633 
July 15, 2022 
(23) Abortion-specific restrictions affect 
the cost and availability of abortion serv-
ices, and the settings in which abortion serv-
ices are delivered. People travel across State 
lines and otherwise engage in interstate 
commerce to access this essential medical 
care, and more would be forced to do so ab-
sent this Act. Likewise, health care pro-
viders travel across State lines and other-
wise engage in interstate commerce in order 
to provide abortion services to patients, and 
more would be forced to do so absent this 
Act. 
(24) Health care providers engage in a form 
of economic and commercial activity when 
they provide abortion services, and there is 
an interstate market for abortion services. 
(25) Abortion restrictions substantially af-
fect interstate commerce in numerous ways. 
For example, to provide abortion services, 
health care providers engage in interstate 
commerce to purchase medicine, medical 
equipment, and other necessary goods and 
services. To provide and assist others in pro-
viding abortion services, health care pro-
viders engage in interstate commerce to ob-
tain and provide training. To provide abor-
tion services, health care providers employ 
and obtain commercial services from doc-
tors, nurses, and other personnel who engage 
in interstate commerce and travel across 
State lines. 
(26) It is difficult and time and resource- 
consuming for clinics to challenge State 
laws that burden or impede abortion serv-
ices. Litigation that blocks one abortion re-
striction may not prevent a State from 
adopting other similarly burdensome abor-
tion restrictions or using different methods 
to burden or impede abortion services. There 
is a history and pattern of States passing 
successive and different laws that unduly 
burden abortion services. 
(27) When a health care provider ceases 
providing abortion services as a result of 
burdensome and medically unnecessary regu-
lations, it is often difficult or impossible for 
that health care provider to recommence 
providing those abortion services, and dif-
ficult or impossible for other health care 
providers to provide abortion services that 
restore or replace the ceased abortion serv-
ices. 
(28) Health care providers are subject to li-
cense laws in various jurisdictions, which are 
not affected by this Act except as provided in 
this Act. 
(29) Congress has the authority to enact 
this Act to protect abortion services pursu-
ant to— 
(A) its powers under the commerce clause 
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
the United States; 
(B) its powers under section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States to enforce the provisions 
of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; 
and 
(C) its powers under the necessary and 
proper clause of section 8 of Article I of the 
Constitution of the United States. 
(30) Congress has used its authority in the 
past to protect access to abortion services 
and health care providers’ ability to provide 
abortion services. In the early 1990s, protests 
and blockades at health care facilities where 
abortion services were provided, and associ-
ated violence, increased dramatically and 
reached crisis level, requiring Congressional 
action. Congress passed the Freedom of Ac-
cess to Clinic Entrances Act (Public Law 103– 
259; 108 Stat. 694) to address that situation 
and protect physical access to abortion serv-
ices. 
(31) Congressional action is necessary to 
put an end to harmful restrictions, to feder-
ally protect access to abortion services for 
everyone regardless of where they live, and 
to protect the ability of health care pro-
viders to provide these services in a safe and 
accessible manner. 
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this 
Act— 
(1) to permit health care providers to pro-
vide abortion services without limitations or 
requirements that single out the provision of 
abortion services for restrictions that are 
more burdensome than those restrictions im-
posed on medically comparable procedures, 
do not significantly advance reproductive 
health or the safety of abortion services, and 
make abortion services more difficult to ac-
cess; 
(2) to promote access to abortion services 
and women’s ability to participate equally in 
the economic and social life of the United 
States; and 
(3) to invoke Congressional authority, in-
cluding the powers of Congress under the 
commerce clause of section 8 of article I of 
the Constitution of the United States, its 
powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to enforce the provisions of

nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, and physi-
cian assistant) that— 
(A) is engaged or seeks to engage in the de-
livery of health care services, including 
abortion services; and 
(B) if required by law or regulation to be li-
censed or certified to engage in the delivery 
of such services—

(ii) would be so licensed or certified but for 
their past, present, or potential provision of 
abortion services permitted by section 4. 
(4) MEDICALLY
COMPARABLE
PROCEDURE.— 
The term ‘‘medically comparable proce-
dures’’ means medical procedures that are 
similar in terms of health and safety risks to 
the patient, complexity, or the clinical set-
ting that is indicated.

sion of any of the foregoing, including any 
unit of local government, such as a county, 
city, town, village, or other general purpose 
political subdivision of a State. 
(7) VIABILITY.—The term ‘‘viability’’ means 
the point in a pregnancy at which, in the 
good-faith medical judgment of the treating 
health care provider, based on the particular 
facts of the case before the health care pro-
vider, there is a reasonable likelihood of sus-
tained fetal survival outside the uterus with 
or without artificial support. 
SEC. 4. PERMITTED SERVICES. 
(a) GENERAL RULE.—A health care provider 
has a statutory right under this Act to pro-
vide abortion services, and may provide 
abortion services, and that provider’s patient 
has a corresponding right to receive such 
services, without any of the following limita-
tions or requirements: 
(1) A requirement that a health care pro-
vider perform specific tests or medical proce-
dures in connection with the provision of 
abortion services, unless generally required 
for the provision of medically comparable 
procedures. 
(2) A requirement that the same health 
care provider who provides abortion services 
also perform specified tests, services, or pro-
cedures prior to or subsequent to the abor-
tion. 
(3) A requirement that a health care pro-
vider offer or provide the patient seeking 
abortion services medically inaccurate infor-
mation in advance of or during abortion 
services. 
(4) A limitation on a health care provider’s 
ability to prescribe or dispense drugs based 
on current evidence-based regimens or the 
provider’s 
good-faith 
medical 
judgment, 
other than a limitation generally applicable 
to the medical profession. 
(5) A limitation on a health care provider’s 
ability to provide abortion services via tele-
medicine, other than a limitation generally 
applicable to the provision of medical serv-
ices via telemedicine. 
(6) A requirement or limitation concerning 
the physical plant, equipment, staffing, or 
hospital transfer arrangements of facilities 
where abortion services are provided, or the 
credentials or hospital privileges or status of 
personnel at such facilities, that is not im-
posed on facilities or the personnel of facili-
ties where medically comparable procedures 
are performed. 
(7) A requirement that, prior to obtaining 
an abortion, a patient make one or more 
medically unnecessary in-person visits to the 
provider of abortion services or to any indi-
vidual or entity that does not provide abor-
tion services. 
(8) A prohibition on abortion at any point 
or points in time prior to fetal viability, in-
cluding a prohibition or restriction on a par-
ticular abortion procedure. 
(9) A prohibition on abortion after fetal vi-
ability when, in the good-faith medical judg-
ment of the treating health care provider, 
continuation of the pregnancy would pose a 
risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health. 
(10) A limitation on a health care pro-
vider’s ability to provide immediate abortion 
services when that health care provider be-
lieves, based on the good-faith medical judg-
ment of the provider, that delay would pose 
a risk to the patient’s health. 
(11) A requirement that a patient seeking 
abortion services at any point or points in 
time prior to fetal viability disclose the pa-
tient’s reason or reasons for seeking abor-
tion services, or a limitation on the provi-
sion or obtaining of abortion services at any 
point or points in time prior to fetal viabil-
ity based on any actual, perceived, or poten-
tial reason or reasons of the patient for ob-
taining 
abortion 
services, 
regardless 
of 
whether the limitation is based on a health 
care provider’s degree of actual or construc-
tive knowledge of such reason or reasons. 
(b) OTHER LIMITATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS.— 
The statutory right specified in subsection 
(a) shall not be limited or otherwise in-
fringed through, in addition to the limita-
tions and requirements specified in para-
graphs (1) through (11) of subsection (a), any 
limitation or requirement that— 
(1) is the same as or similar to one or more 
of the limitations or requirements described 
in subsection (a); or 
(2) both— 
(A) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as 
implemented singles out the provision of 
abortion services, health care providers who

provide abortion services, or facilities in 
which abortion services are provided; and 
(B) impedes access to abortion services. 
(c) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—Factors a 
court may consider in determining whether a 
limitation or requirement impedes access to 
abortion services for purposes of subsection 
(b)(2)(B) include the following: 
(1) Whether the limitation or requirement, 
in a provider’s good-faith medical judgment, 
interferes with a health care provider’s abil-
ity to provide care and render services, or 
poses a risk to the patient’s health or safety. 
(2) Whether the limitation or requirement 
is reasonably likely to delay or deter some 
patients in accessing abortion services. 
(3) Whether the limitation or requirement 
is reasonably likely to directly or indirectly 
increase the cost of providing abortion serv-
ices or the cost for obtaining abortion serv-
ices (including costs associated with travel, 
childcare, or time off work). 
(4) Whether the limitation or requirement 
is reasonably likely to have the effect of ne-
cessitating a trip to the offices of a health 
care provider that would not otherwise be re-
quired. 
(5) Whether the limitation or requirement 
is reasonably likely to result in a decrease in 
the availability of abortion services in a 
given State or geographic region. 
(6) Whether the limitation or requirement 
imposes penalties that are not imposed on 
other health care providers for comparable 
conduct or failure to act, or that are more 
severe than penalties imposed on other 
health care providers for comparable con-
duct or failure to act. 
(7) The cumulative impact of the limita-
tion or requirement combined with other 
new or existing limitations or requirements. 
(d) EXCEPTION.—To defend against a claim 
that a limitation or requirement violates a 
health care provider’s or patient’s statutory 
rights under subsection (b), a party must es-
tablish, by clear and convincing evidence, 
that— 
(1) the limitation or requirement signifi-
cantly advances the safety of abortion serv-
ices or the health of patients; and 
(2) the safety of abortion services or the 
health of patients cannot be advanced by a 
less restrictive alternative measure or ac-
tion.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally di-
vided among and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) and the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and add extraneous material on 
H.R. 8296, the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act of 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 8296, the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act. 
This bill is necessary now more than 
ever 
following 
the 
Republican-con-
trolled Supreme Court’s extreme deci-
sion ripping away a woman’s right to 
abortion. The Court’s ideological deci-
sion ignored nearly 50 years of prece-
dent and is the culmination of decades 
of unrelenting efforts by Republican 
politicians to control women and their 
bodies. 
The consequences of last month’s de-
cision have been swift and severe. Al-
ready, abortion bans are in effect in 
nine States, and more than a dozen 
more are expected to either ban or se-
verely limit abortion soon. 
As a result, women are being forced 
to travel long distances to States 
where abortion remains lawful or, for 
those who lack logistical or financial 
support to travel, continue pregnancies 
against their wishes. There have been 
devastating stories of patients being 
denied care and doctors hesitating to 
provide lifesaving healthcare services 
out of fear of criminalization. 
States have enacted dangerous laws 
banning abortion without any excep-
tions, inciting citizens to track and re-
port women in need of an abortion and 
criminalizing providers or those assist-
ing someone in obtaining care. 
These laws turn back the clock on 
the health, well-being, and equality of 
women across the Nation. Republicans 
have made it clear: This is just the be-
ginning. Congressional Republicans are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 15, 2022 
already pushing a nationwide abortion 
ban that would criminalize abortion in 
all 50 States. 
That is why this House is acting 
today on the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act to restore the right to abor-
tion nationwide. This legislation en-
sures that no matter where you live, 
you have a right to comprehensive 
healthcare that is free from unneces-
sary restrictions that are intended 
only to impede access. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation to 
protect the right to abortion and en-
sure that all Americans are entitled to 
make their own healthcare decisions. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, to protect the help-
less, most powerless, most innocent 
among us, I rise in strong opposition to 
H.R. 8296, the abortion on demand until 
birth act. 
This is not about codifying Roe v. 
Wade. Why? Because it nationalizes 
abortion for all 9 months of preg-
nancy—all 9 months. This would make 
America as radical as China and North 
Korea. 
The abortion on demand until birth 
act would legalize discriminatory abor-
tion based upon sex, race, and dis-
ability, including Down syndrome. It 
overrides 
State 
laws 
that 
protect 
women from coercion. It would weaken 
conscience protections to force pro-life 
doctors to perform abortions and end a 
life. 
This is especially frightening for 
pregnancy centers, faith-based pro-
viders, and medical professionals who 
are using amazing medical achieve-
ments in treating both mothers and 
their babies in the wombs as patients. 
We are doing prenatal heart surgery 
today in the United States of America. 
The abortion on demand until birth 
act has nothing to do with protecting 
the health of women. It has everything 
to do with forcing an extreme agenda 
on the American people. 
Rather than prey on women’s vulner-
abilities and fears and nationalize 
abortion for all 9 months, we should be 
coming together to support women and 
their families at every stage of preg-
nancy and beyond. 
Every mother matters. Seventy-six 
percent of women seeking abortions 
say they would choose life if their cir-
cumstances were different. The focus 
should be on how to change their cir-
cumstances, help them access the care 
and support that they need, and im-
prove their lives. 
Presenting abortion up until birth as 
a woman’s only option is a false choice. 
There are nearly 3,000 pregnancy cen-
ters in all 50 States. They outnumber 
Planned Parenthood by more than 2,000 
facilities. These pregnancy centers, 
which are right now under violent at-
tack by pro-abortion groups, provide 
medical care, resources, education, and 
mentoring to women. They must be 
protected, not undermined and threat-
ened by an extreme abortion agenda. 
The Supreme Court has affirmed the 
American people’s rights to speak 
through their elected officials and 
enact laws that protect unborn chil-
dren. The question upon us today is: 
How are we going to respond? How is 
this body going to respond to the 
greatest human rights issue of our gen-
eration? That is the question. This is 
the human rights issue of our genera-
tion. 
Do not close your ears. Do not close 
your eyes. Do not close your heart. 
Is it by dehumanizing life and pro-
moting a culture that destroys the 
weakest among us? Is that how we are 
going to do it? Or is it by making abor-
tion unthinkable by leading a new era 
where 
every 
person’s 
God-given, 
unalienable human right to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness for 
all be the way we will define ourselves? 
Let’s come together. Let’s protect 
the human rights of the unborn. We 
cannot deny life to the most disadvan-
taged and marginalized among us. 
They have no voice to defend them-
selves. 
Madam Speaker, abortion for all 9 
months is not the will of the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
H.R. 8296, the abortion on demand until 
birth act because all lives are worth 
living, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 0945 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU), the sponsor of 
this legislation. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of my bill, the 
Women’s Health Protection Act, or 
WHPA. 
WHPA is the bill that will protect 
the right to access abortion after the 
tragic fall of Roe v. Wade. It ensures in 
Federal law the right to abortion care 
for every woman in every State and en-
sures States may not erode that right. 
You will hear Republicans say our 
bill goes too far, but that is simply not 
true. Our bill preserves the protections 
of Roe that we have lived with for 50 
years, affirmed through decades of sub-
sequent court decisions. WHPA pro-
hibits the bans and restrictions that 
violate the spirit of Roe, from outright 
bans to laws forcing women to undergo 
invasive 
ultrasounds, 
unnecessary 
waiting periods, or forcing doctors to 
give patients medically inaccurate in-
formation. 
You will hear Republicans repeat 
over and over again that Democrats 
are voting for abortion up until the 
moment of birth. Actually, for 50 years 
the Court had the provision of an ex-
ception for late-term abortion in Roe 
to preserve the life or the health of the 
mother. It is because they valued the 
life of the mother. 
Do Republicans actually believe the 
mother’s life is expendable? 
Apparently so. 
What you will not hear is Repub-
licans say that the vast majority of 
Americans do not want Roe to be over-
turned. 
You will not hear an apology to the 
10-year-old who was raped and had to 
travel to Indiana for an abortion be-
cause it was prohibited in her home 
State. 
You will not hear an acknowledg-
ment that women are capable of decid-
ing for themselves whether to termi-
nate a pregnancy. 
This bill respects our right to make 
our own decisions about our bodies. It 
is time to put control of our bodies 
back in our hands. Now is the time to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, it 
has been 22 days since the Supreme 
Court overturned Roe v. Wade, taking 
away women’s ability to make choices 
about their own future, setting us back 
nearly 50 years. But even that is not 
enough for Republicans. 
In the last 24 hours alone, we have 
gotten a glimpse into the dark future 
Republicans have in store for women, 
doctors, and vulnerable children: 
The Indiana attorney general says he 
is investigating the doctor who treated 
a 10-year-old rape victim. 
Texas sues the Biden administration 
for requiring abortions in medical 
emergencies so that women’s lives 
could be saved. 
And the National Right to Life offi-
cial who said the 10-year-old should 
have had her baby. 
Yes, according to Republicans, even a 
little girl impregnated by a brutal rape 
should be denied an abortion and have 
to 
endure 
a 
government-mandated 
birth. 
Remember, this is the same party 
that has voted against: 
Paid family and medical leave for 
parents of that baby. 
Childcare for babies. 
Universal pre-K for babies. 
The Child Tax Credit, which helps ba-
bies. 
School lunch programs that help ba-
bies. 
Commonsense gun violence preven-
tion measures that keep those babies 
safe in school, and much more. 
The Republicans’ war on women has 
never been more dangerous. Today, we 
will vote on the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act to ensure that women 
across this country have access to 
abortion and the freedom to make 
their own decisions about their bodies 
and their futures. 
America, Democrats have your back. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
CAMMACK), a dynamic example of life in 
her own testimony.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6636 
July 15, 2022 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD some articles 
that I feel are relevant to this debate. 
[From the New York Times, July 3, 2022] 
ABORTION LAWS AROUND THE WORLD 
The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on abor-
tion quickly led to bans in at least eight 
states, a shift toward criminalization that 
runs counter to recent easings in countries 
that had longstanding bans. 
The Supreme Court’s elimination of the 
constitutional right to abortion, after nearly 
a half-century, has made the United States 
one of the few countries actively strength-
ening abortion restrictions. 
Abortion is now banned in at least eight 
states, a shift toward criminalization that 
runs counter to the longstanding policies of 
some close allies, like Canada, and to recent 
easings in several nations that had long im-
posed bans, like Ireland, Mexico and South 
Korea. 
But no nations share the same history re-
garding abortion, nor does any part of the 
world have uniform laws: Women seeking 
abortions everywhere must navigate distinct 
rules, in a variety of health care systems, if 
access is available at all. The following ex-
amples, while not comprehensive, illustrate 
the diversity of those laws—and how they’re 
changing. 
CANADA 
No laws restrict abortion in Canada, where 
it is covered by provincial and territorial 
public health care systems as an essential 
medical procedure within 20 weeks of concep-
tion and, under some circumstances, after 
that point, such as when a pregnancy threat-
ens the mother’s life. Access and exceptions 
vary by province, and sometimes by hospital. 
Until 1988, criminal laws allowed abortions 
only if approved by committees of physi-
cians. That year, the Supreme Court struck 
down the laws in a landmark case. Most 
legal scholars agree that if the issue were to 
reach the court again, it would make the 
right to abortion explicit.—Ian Austen 
MEXICO 
Before a court ruling last year, abortion 
was largely restricted, with Mexico City and 
only three of 31 states permitting the proce-
dure up to 12 weeks of fetal gestation. But 
the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the 
fall that penalizing women who undergo 
abortions was unconstitutional, and in the 
months since, five more states have moved 
to legalize abortions. 
The justices did not specify how far into a 
pregnancy abortion was permitted, leaving 
the details to the states. For the states that 
still ban abortion, legislatures will need to 
change laws to permit the procedure.—Maria 
Abi-Habib 
NICARAGUA 
Abortion is completely illegal and punish-
able by jail for the woman and the doctors. 
The Legislature eliminated all exceptions 
in 2006, ending a century of law that allowed 
abortions in cases of life-threatening com-
plications or pregnancies caused by rape.

of criminalizing abortion, has received sup-
port from Evangelical leaders in Nicaragua 
and the United States.—Yubelka Mendoza

BRITAIN 
Abortions have been legal in England, 
Scotland and Wales for more than 50 years, 
protected by the Abortion Act of 1967. Abor-
tions can be legally performed up to the 24th 
week of pregnancy and must be medically 
approved by two doctors. 
The 1967 law allows some exceptions for 
later-term abortions, including when the 
pregnancy endangers the woman’s health or 
if a prenatal scan reveals a fetus abnor-
mality. A provision of the law allowing abor-
tion if the fetus carries significant risk of se-
rious disability was at the center of a court 
case last year. 
In rare circumstances, such as when a 
woman, without doctors’ consent, takes 
medicine intended to terminate a pregnancy, 
an abortion could be prosecuted as a crimi-
nal act. 
The 1967 law did not cover Northern Ire-
land, which for decades prohibited almost all 
abortions. 
British lawmakers overturned that ban in 
2019, legalizing ‘‘unconditional termination’’ 
of pregnancy within the first 12 weeks. But 
with resistance coming from anti-abortion 
and church groups, abortion services remain 
limited.—Saskia Solomon 
IRELAND 
A 1983 constitutional amendment banned 
nearly all abortion, reflecting the Roman 
Catholic Church’s deep influence in the 
country. That influence had waned by 2018, 
when a referendum to end the ban was ap-
proved by 66 percent of voters. 
Lawmakers then legalized abortion in the 
Health Act of 2018, allowing abortion for any 
reason up to the end of the first trimester. 
The law provides exceptions beyond 12 weeks 
in cases of fetal abnormalities considered 
fatal after birth or a potential risk to the 
woman’s health.—Saskia Solomon 
POLAND 
Soviet-era Poland offered some of Europe’s 
broadest abortion access, and it became a 
destination for women seeking abortions. 
But after the Soviet Union’s collapse, and 
under the influence of the Catholic Church, 
the Polish Parliament in 1993 passed one of 
Europe’s 
strictest 
bans, 
asserting 
that 
‘‘every human being shall have an inherent 
right to life from the moment of concep-
tion.’’ 
It allowed three categories of exception: 
danger to the mother’s health or life; rape or 
incest; severe fetal abnormalities. 
Despite mass protests, the ban was tight-
ened last year by the nationalist Law and 
Justice Party, eliminating the most-used ex-
ception—fetal 
abnormalities—which 
ac-
counted for almost all of the roughly 1,000 
legal abortions a year. An estimated 100,000 
to 150,000 illegal abortions take place very 
year in the country, activists say. 
The remaining exceptions are problematic 
for abortion seekers. Rape victims face a 
deadline of the 12th week of pregnancy, and 
they require a certificate from a prosecutor, 
which takes a long time to acquire. And the 
definition of what constitutes a ‘‘serious’’ 
risk to a woman’s health is too vague for 
doctors to always act decisively. In a small 
number of cases, women have died of sepsis 
after doctors refused to intervene while the 
fetus’s heart was still beating. 
Women cannot be punished for taking an 
abortion pill or undergoing an abortion 
abroad. 
Anyone deemed to have aided or abetted an 
illegal abortion faces up to eight years in 
prison.—Katrin Bennhold 
INDIA 
A total ban was eased in 1971 with the Med-
ical Termination of Pregnancy Act, which 
made some abortions legal. 
But activists continued to seek further 
easing, to include abortion in cases of fetal 
anomaly or pregnancy caused by rape. In 
2021, the federal government amended the 
law, expanding the criteria for legal abor-
tions and adding a privacy clause to protect 
women who went to clinics. 
The law allows women to terminate preg-
nancies until 20 weeks. Between 20 and 24 
weeks, a woman needs two doctors to ap-
prove an abortion, and after 24 weeks, abor-
tions are allowed only when the woman’s 
health is at risk. Women can now terminate 
unwanted pregnancies caused by contracep-
tive failure regardless of marital status; be-
fore the amendment, only a married couple 
could do that. 
Still, abortions done in violation of the law 
are punishable by up to seven years in prison 
for the woman and medical personnel.— 
Sameer Yasir 
CHINA 
Abortion has been legal in some form since 
1953. By the 1970s, as the ruling Chinese Com-
munist Party grew increasingly worried 
about overpopulation, abortion became more 
widely accessible, and the one-child policy 
led to some forced abortions. 
Sex-selective abortions are illegal, meant 
to counter the widespread preference for 
boys over girls. In response to recent con-
cerns over declining birthrates and an aging 
population, families may now have three 
children without penalty. Given the govern-
ment’s invasive family planning policies, 
some women fear it will restrict abortion ac-
cess. The authorities last year said they in-
tended to reduce ‘‘medically unnecessary 
abortions,’’ without explaining how. 
Access to abortion services varies by re-
gion, with some requiring women to produce 
certificates of medical necessity. In Jiangxi 
Province, women who are more than 14 
weeks pregnant need three signatures from 
medical personnel. 
Scholars, activists and some foreign gov-
ernments have accused the authorities of 
using family planning policies to suppress 
ethnic minorities, which the government de-
nies.—Vivian Wang 
KENYA 
Under the 2010 Constitution, abortion is 
permitted if a trained health professional de-
termines a need for emergency treatment, or 
if the pregnancy endangers the life or health 
of the mother. In other circumstances, abor-
tion providers can face up to 14 years in pris-
on under Kenya’s penal code. 
In practice, many women who could obtain 
a legal abortion cannot because of poverty, 
lack of access to health services or a lack of 
information about their rights.—Matthew 
Mpoke Bigg 
BENIN 
Last fall, Benin joined South Africa and 
Mozambique as one of the few African coun-
tries to broadly legalize abortion within 12 
weeks. 
Under the new law, abortion will be al-
lowed ‘‘when the pregnancy is likely to ag-
gravate or cause a situation of material, edu-
cational, professional or moral distress in-
compatible with the interest of the woman 
and/or the unborn child.’’ In doing so, Benin 
became the third country in Africa, along 
with Ethiopia and Zambia, to allow abortion 
based on the social or economic needs of the 
woman. 
The previous law authorized abortion only 
if the pregnancy endangered the woman’s life 
or was the result of rape or incest, or if the 
fetus was malformed. The new law will take 
effect after the authorities detail how it will 
be applied, which could take months.—Elian 
Peltier 
EGYPT 
A strict anti-abortion law has been on the 
books for 85 years, derived from the French 
Penal Code of the colonial era that bans the 
procedure under nearly any circumstances. 
The woman and doctor face imprisonment if 
convicted. 
It does have one loophole, which is based 
on the medical code of ethics: Doctors are al-
lowed—but not legally obligated—to termi-
nate a pregnancy if it puts the woman’s life

at risk and she signs a document saying the 
procedure was lifesaving. 
Though convictions are uncommon, the 
law and social stigma have pushed abortion 
practices out of public sight, where the wom-
an’s safety cannot be protected and the pro-
cedure can be prohibitively expensive.—Nada 
Rashwan 
TURKEY 
Since 1983, abortion has been legal up to 10 
weeks after conception. Married women need 
spousal consent. The law allows exceptions 
after 10 weeks when the pregnancy threatens 
the life of the woman, if the doctor concludes 
the fetus has a grave disability, and in cases 
of rape. 
Violators face prosecution and prison—for 
both the woman and the doctor. 
Abortion remains a divisive issue. In 2012, 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now the president 
and then prime minister, called abortion 
murder and urged more restrictions. After 
popular outrage, the law was never amended, 
but in practice, abortion services are un-
available in many state hospitals—Safak

SUMMER OF RAGE: TRACKING ATTACKS ON 
PREGNANCY CENTERS AND PRO-LIFE GROUPS 
ATTACKS SINCE SUPREME COURT LEAK 
CV News Feed—More than 50 pregnancy re-
source centers and offices of pro-life groups 
have been attacked and vandalized since a 
draft Supreme Court opinon overturning Roe 
v. Wade was leaked in early May. Pro-abor-
tion domestic terrorists have claimed re-
sponsibility—and are promising more at-
tacks in a ‘‘summer of rage’’. 
Pregnancy centers are bracing for more at-
tacks and acts of vandalism after the Su-
preme Court issued its final ruling over-
turning Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022. The 
Department of Homeland Security issued a 
memo the same day warning that ‘‘domestic 
violent extremists’’ would exploit the deci-
sion to commit acts of violence against var-
ious targets, specifically naming Jane’s Re-
venge. Various terror groups have issued 
threats against them on social media since 
the decision was made, with one group urg-
ing its followers to ‘‘mask up, stay dan-
gerous’’. 
Some attacks are going unreported be-
cause pregnancy resource centers want to 
protect their clients. This post covers at-
tacks which have been reported in the news 
media, sent as tips directly to CatholicVote, 
or uncovered from terrorist groups online. If 
you know of an attack which is not covered

Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to fight for life and in strong 
opposition to H.R. 8296, the abortion on 
demand until birth act. You know, I 
never thought that I would have to 
stand here on the House floor and de-
bate the fact that killing someone for 
their gender, their sex, their race—but 
here we are. 
We are debating a bill that is being 
pushed by my colleagues on the other 
side that would legalize abortions 
based on a baby’s sex, race, or poten-
tial disability. I am going to say that 
again because I think that is perhaps 
the most outrageous, horrific, regres-
sive, sexist, and racist part of this leg-
islation. 
This bill allows for abortions up until 
the day of natural delivery because the 
child maybe isn’t the right sex or the 
right race, according to the mother, 
who is a woman, by the way. We need 
to stop this lie that suddenly abortion 
is healthcare—it is not. 
I have heard repeatedly talk about 
this 10-year-old girl who was brutally 
raped—this is a heartbreaking situa-
tion—yet, not a single peep about the 
man who did this. He was an illegal 
who crossed our border, who never 
should have been in our country in the 
first place, who committed this crime. 
Not one peep. 
In our country, we are based really, 
quite frankly, on a simple notion that 
we are of equal opportunity, not equal 
outcome. Abortion, that is equal out-
come. We know the outcome. 
All I am asking today is that my col-
leagues think a little bit critically 
about what they are doing and what 
they are saying, the message that they 
are sending—that they believe in equal 
outcome, not opportunity because they 
are, quite frankly, denying the right 
for every single one of these children 
the opportunity to live. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, my, my, my, here we 
go again—or should I say to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle— 
lie, lie, lie. 
The United States Supreme Court 
has dismantled access to legal abortion 
giving the very, very personal decision 
concerning 
a 
person’s 
reproductive 
health, their life and future to strange 
politicians. 
Now, Republicans across the country 
and in Congress are moving full steam 
ahead toward their dark and extreme 
goal of a nationwide abortion ban that 
will throw doctors into jail, force chil-
dren to bear children, lead to tragic 
deaths, and life-changing hardships for 
people in our country. 
That is why I rise in support of the 
Women’s Health Protection Act that 
will facilitate access to legal abortion 
care regardless of a person’s ZIP Code. 
Let me warn everyone that the Re-
publican agenda includes even more 
drastic intrusions into our personal 
lives—banning legal abortion is just 
the start. We will fight back. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE), the 
chairwoman of Oversight and Inves-
tigations Subcommittee. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, the 
horror of a 10-year-old girl, the victim 
of rape, re-victimized when her parents 
were forced to take her out of State be-
cause of Ohio’s abortion law. 
A woman who was having a mis-
carriage, whose doctor refused to give 
her the medical procedure she needed 
because of fear of being prosecuted. 
A woman trying to get long-acting 
birth control, whose pharmacist re-
fused to prescribe the necessary medi-
cation for the procedure. 
The chaos in the wake of the terrible 
Dobbs decision is only going to get 
worse from here. 
The Supreme Court and the Repub-
lican Party have declared a war on 
Americans’ healthcare rights. Every 
single American has the right and the 
freedom to make the healthcare deci-
sions that they need, including abor-
tion. 
We passed this bill last September. 
We passed it in September after the 
first decision in the Supreme Court. We 
are going to pass this bill today in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. We are 
going to pass this bill, which codifies 
Roe v. Wade, every time we need to, to 
protect 
Americans’ 
rights 
to 
healthcare and to protect everybody’s 
equality. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know of any 
State laws that prevent birth control. 
Miscarriages are obviously a tragedy. 
The question before us today is on 
the legislation that would allow for 
abortion up until birth, 9 months. It is 
not the will of the American people; it 
is the extreme agenda of those that are 
promoting abortion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
GUTHRIE), the leader on the Health 
Subcommittee.

July 15, 2022 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the abortion on 
demand until birth act. 
This Supreme Court ruled each indi-
vidual State can decide the rights for 
the unborn. This bill would override 
State laws to nationalize abortion for 
any reason at any stage of pregnancy 
up until birth. 
This does not merely ban pre-viabil-
ity restrictions on abortion, as sup-
porters say that it does. This bill al-
lows the person doing the abortion to 
decide what qualifies as pre-viability. 
This is unacceptable. 
The majority of Americans do not 
support abortions with no limits. In 
fact, 80 percent of the Americans say 
abortions should be illegal in the third 
trimester. This is a radical bill, and I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TONKO), who 
chairs our Environment and Climate 
Change Subcommittee. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in resounding support of the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. 
This bill will restore a fundamental 
constitutional right that has been sim-
ply stripped away by a rogue rightwing 
Supreme Court. 
While my Republican colleagues cele-
brate this injustice and cook up plans 
for a nationwide abortion ban, Ameri-
cans across the country are already 
feeling the devastating effects of the 
decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Stories of a 10-year-old child having 
to travel to neighboring States to re-
ceive care, or women bleeding from ec-
topic pregnancies have shocked the 
world—as red States, many with some 
of the highest maternal mortality 
rates in the country, have rolled back 
abortion access. 
None of the courts, nor States, nor 
politicians should have a say in wom-
en’s ability to make their own deci-
sions about their health, their well- 
being, and their future. That rests with 
their loved ones, their doctor, and their 
God. 
If we claim to love freedom—to be a 
free and just society—we must ensure 
that this basic human right is finally 
enshrined into law.

RODGERS

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for

Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
two articles of attacks on 
churches and pro-life pregnancy cen-
ters. 
[From the National Catholic Register] 
ATTACKS ON CHURCHES, PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY 
CENTERS CONTINUE 
A pro-life sign at St. Teresa of Avila 
Catholic Church in Hutchinson, Kansas, 
about 50 miles northwest of Wichita, was 
vandalized over the weekend. 
Since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization decision on Friday, at-
tacks on Catholic churches and pro-life preg-
nancy centers have been reported in West 
Virginia, Washington, Virginia, Louisiana, 
Colorado, California, Texas, Florida, New 
York, and Indiana. 
Below are the latest recorded attacks since 
the decision. 
Matt Vainer, a spokesperson for the Dio-
cese of Wichita, said that the perpetrator 
was followed by a witness who called the po-
lice. The perpetrator was arrested, he said. 
The pastor of St. Teresa of Avila, Father 
Aaron Spexarth, placed the sign underneath 
a crucifix in the church, as he believed it was 
most appropriate to place it at Christ’s feet, 
Vainer confirmed to CNA. 
All Saints Catholic Church in Portland, 
Oregon had its sign defaced with pro-abor-
tion graffiti June 25. 
A photo of the vandalism shows the words 
‘‘If abortions aren’t safe, neither are you!— 
XOXO Jane.’’ The FBI is investigating, Bar-
bara Custer, a parish secretary at the 
church, told CNA. 
A Woman’s Friend Pregnancy Resource 
Clinic in Yuba City, California was vandal-
ized June 27. 
The clinic had one of its windows smashed 
by what seems to be one perpetrator accord-
ing to video footage, the clinic’s executive 
director Kristen Bird told CNA. 
Video shows the perpetrator throwing 
three rocks at the window until it broke. Re-
pairs will cost anywhere between $700 and 
$900. The FBI is investigating, Bird said. 
[From the Daily Caller, July 12, 2022] 
ELIZABETH WARREN CALLS TO ‘SHUT DOWN’ 
CRISIS
PREGNANCY
CENTERS
AMID
PRO- 
ABORTION ATTACKS 
(By Nicole Silverio) 
Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren called on crisis pregnancy centers to 
be ‘‘shut down’’ across the country Tuesday 
as pro-abortion groups vandalize and commit 
arson on centers throughout the nation. 
The senator claimed the centers ‘‘fool’’ and 
‘‘torture’’ women into carrying their preg-
nancies to term as they seek abortion access. 
She lamented that the centers outnumber 
abortion clinics in Massachusetts by 3 to 1. 
‘‘In Massachusetts right now, those crisis 
pregnancy centers that are there to fool peo-
ple who are looking for pregnancy termi-
nation help outnumber true abortion clinics 
by 3 to 1, she said. ‘‘We need to shut them 
down here in Massachusetts and we need to 
shut them down all around the country,’’ she 
told NBC 10 Boston. ‘‘You should not be able 
to torture a pregnant person like that,’’ 
Warren’s criticisms of crisis pregnancy 
centers follow multiple attacks on the cen-
ters facilitated by pro-abortion activists 
since the Supreme Court draft majority 
opinion leaked in May. 
Surveillance footage showed a suspect 
spray painted the words ‘‘If Abortions Aren’t 
Safe, You Aren’t Either’’ and broke the win-
dows of the Next Step Pregnancy Center in 
Lynwood, Washington, in late May. An un-
known pro-abortion group splattered the 
Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center with 
red paint and marked the words ‘‘Jane Says 
Revenge’’ in graffiti. 
Police arrested 10 pro-abortion protesters 
for allegedly throwing smoke bombs at an 
Oregon pregnancy center on June 27. The ac-
tivist 
group 
Jane’s 
Revenge 
allegedly 
firebombed crisis pregnancy center in Am-
herst, New York, overnight on June 7, while 
arsonists attacked Wisconsin Family Action 
in Madison. The Oregon Right to Life offices 
in Keizer, Oregon, were also firebombed with 
Molotov cocktails. 
The centers offer free or low-cost preg-
nancy testing, education on adoption serv-
ices, ultrasounds, STD testing and treat-
ment, prenatal and parenting lessons, after 
abortion recovery counseling and sexual risk 
avoidance education, according to the Char-
lotte Lozier Institute. 
The Massachusetts senator has repeatedly 
called for the construction of abortion clin-
ics on federal lands and national parks since 
the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, 
handing states the right to regulate abor-
tion. She suggested that tents and trained 
medical personnel be set up on federally 
funded property to allow women to access 
abortion. 
In a New York Times op-ed, she and Demo-
cratic Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith advocated 
the use of ‘‘federal property and resources to 
protect people seeking abortion services lo-
cally.’’ 
Warren and several prominent Democratic 
lawmakers signed a letter urging President 
Joe Biden increase access to medication 
abortion and establish a medical ombudsman 
at the Department of Human Health and 
Services and Department of Justice to ana-
lyze data on the types of reproductive serv-
ices needed and provide that on federal 
lands. 
‘‘The Department of Justice and all rel-
evant agencies could analyze the types of re-
productive health services that could be pro-
vided on federal property, especially in 
states where such services are limited by 
state law or regulation,’’ the letter stated. 
The senator’s push for clinics on federal 
lands is currently prevented by the Hyde 
Amendment, which prohibits federal funding 
toward abortions except in cases endan-
gering the mother’s life. Many activists esti-
mate that the Hyde Amendment prevents at 
least 60,000 abortion per year. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose the un-
conscionable abortion on demand until 
birth act. 
This bill creates a national standard 
to allow for abortions of unborn chil-
dren for any reason and at any stage of 
pregnancy up until birth. As a father 
and grandfather of six precious grand-
children, I am sickened by the attempt 
to allow abortion on demand until 
birth. 
Now, Madam Speaker, I will speak 
for just a second about something that 
was brought up by one of my col-
leagues across the aisle about phar-
macists dispensing prescriptions for 
abortion. 
Also, Madam Speaker, if you could, 
do me a favor and get a message to the 
President who is trying to sign an ex-
ecutive order to force pharmacists to 
fill prescriptions against their will for 
abortion. Let me assure you, you can 
pass all the legislation you want, and 
you can sign every executive order that 
you want to sign, but if you think you 
are going to force a pharmacist to go 
against their moral obligation to take 
care of patients and to take care of ba-
bies and dispense a prescription that is 
going to be used for abortion, good 
luck with that. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. CLARKE), who is a 
member of our committee. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to stand against 
the vile war for reproductive rights of 
the women in America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6639 
July 15, 2022 
Just under 50 years ago, Roe v. Wade 
established that every woman holds au-
tonomy over her own body and her re-
productive choices. To reject this crit-
ical ruling one-half century later at a 
time 
when 
America’s 
maternal 
healthcare standards are so disgrace-
fully abysmal, particularly for Black 
and Brown women, is as hateful as it is 
cruel. 
We will not stand for this blatant and 
brazen attempt to control women. We 
will not stand for yet another assault 
that diminishes women by taking away 
their autonomy of their bodies. We will 
not stand by and watch extremists 
erase us from our Constitutional pro-
tections. 
No. We will not stand for it today. I 
and my Democratic colleagues will 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act of 2022 and the Ensuring Women’s 
Right to Reproductive Freedom Act of 
2022. 
Madam Speaker, I urge our Senators 
to find the compassion, courage, and 
their humanity for the women of 
America by doing the same. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask what 
about the marginalized Black and His-
panic babies who are more likely to be 
aborted? 
Abortion has had a disproportionate 
impact on minorities and individuals 
with disabilities. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS), who is 
also a member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Women’s 
Health Protection Act and lend my 
voice to the chorus of calls across the 
country for urgent action on abortion 
rights. 
When I first heard the news of the 
Dobbs decision, I felt as if I were 
thrown into another country—a coun-
try without our Constitution. 
How is it that such a fundamental 
right to our autonomy over one’s body, 
over one’s life, and over one’s future 
can be stripped away so callously? 
We are talking about far-right Jus-
tices telling women that they cannot 
get the care that they need and telling 
doctors that they cannot treat their 
patients to the best of their ability. 
Yes, these five Justices with no med-
ical expertise stole the fundamental 
freedom of controlling the health of 
one’s own body and opened the flood-
gates to criminalize doctors for doing 
their job. 
Make no mistake, Madam Speaker: 
this is a stain on our healthcare sys-
tem and a flat-out assault on health 
equity, and it is a self-inflicted wound. 
This resolution will leave women—es-
pecially women of color and low-in-
come women, including White women— 
in the lurch. So in the absence of any 
respect or compassion for reproductive 
health in this country, we, as a body, 
must show our leadership. It is incum-
bent upon us elected officials to ensure 
that the basic right is restored and fi-
nally written into law. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
will do that. It would restore 50 years 
of 
precedent 
and 
right 
a 
deeply 
invasive wrong. History has its eyes on 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MIL-
LER-MEEKS), who is another healthcare 
provider. Dr. MARIANNETTE
MILLER- 
MEEKS has worked hard to improve the 
lives of many throughout her career. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague, the 
Honorable Representative RODGERS, for 
yielding me time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 8296. The Supreme Court 
recently took the important and cor-
rect step to return the power to regu-
late abortion back to State legislators 
and voters within the individual States 
while recognizing the sanctity of life. 
This concept is so novel and repug-
nant to the Democrats that they would 
put forward a radical and extreme 
abortion bill that would permit abor-
tion even up until birth for any reason. 
Only seven countries, including China 
and North Korea, are this extreme. 
As a doctor, I am knowledgeable that 
mid- to late-term abortion is a bar-
baric procedure which can include dis-
memberment of the baby and crushing 
of the skull. This is far more cruel than 
many of the laws of States that define 
prisoner abuse of convicted felons and 
what constitutes animal cruelty. It is a 
procedure done when the mother is 
given anesthesia, but the baby can feel 
pain. Madam Speaker, even though you 
cannot hear it scream, it can respond 
to music and respond to touch and the 
voice of its mother. 
We wouldn’t allow animals to be 
treated this cruelly. 
Do Democrats think that this ele-
vates women and is compassionate? 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article from the Charlotte 
Lozier Institute.

GESTATIONAL
LIMITS
ON
ABORTION
IN
THE 
UNITED
STATES
COMPARED
TO
INTER-
NATIONAL NORMS 
(By Angelina Baglini, J.D.) 
Abstract: The United States is one of only 
seven countries in the world that permit 
elective abortion past 20 weeks. Upholding 
laws restricting abortion on demand after 20 
weeks would situate the United States closer 
to the international mainstream, instead of 
leaving it as an outlying country with ultra- 
permissive abortion policies. 
This report compares gestational limits in 
United States abortion law with gestational 
limits in the abortion law of the inter-
national community. The goal is to deter-
mine where the United States stands in com-
parison to international norms, with its fed-
eral policy enshrined in Roe v. Wade, which 
allows abortion past 20 weeks and without 
restriction until fetal viability. 
The sample group for this project included 
a total of 198 countries, independent states, 
and semi-autonomous regions with popu-
lations exceeding 1 million. Of these 198 
countries, independent states, and regions 
worldwide, 59 allow abortion without restric-
tion as to reason, otherwise known as elec-
tive abortion or abortion on demand. The re-
maining 139 countries require some reason to 
obtain an abortion ranging from most re-
strictive (to save the life of the mother or 
completely prohibited) to least restrictive 
(socioeconomic grounds) with various rea-
sons in between (e.g., physical health, men-
tal health). 
Currently, the United States permits abor-
tion on demand through viability, which is 
usually marked around 24 weeks. For this re-
port, it is appropriate to compare the United 
States with the other 58 countries that allow 
abortion on demand up to some point in 
pregnancy. The remaining 139 countries re-
quire some reason to obtain an abortion 
(that is to say, they do not permit abortion 
on demand) and are, by definition, more re-
strictive than the United States on the issue 
of gestational limits. To require some reason 
before obtaining an abortion is inherently 
more restrictive than not requiring any rea-
son at all. 
This report finds that the United States is 
one of only seven countries in the world that 
permit elective abortion past 20 weeks. This 
finding suggests that current proposals in 
the United States to restrict elective abor-
tions past 20 weeks would move the United 
States from the fringe, ultra-permissive end 
of the spectrum to a position closer to inter-
national norms. 
TERMINOLOGY AND METHOD OF COMPARISON 
Not all countries or statutes use the same 
terminology when drafting restrictions on 
late-term elective abortion. When drafting a 
restriction on elective abortion past 20 
weeks of pregnancy, the most common meas-
urement of ‘‘weeks of pregnancy’’ is gesta-
tional age, or in short form ‘‘gestation.’’ 
Gestational age marks the duration of preg-
nancy, which is most commonly and medi-
cally measured from the date of the woman’s 
last menstrual period. The woman’s last 
menstrual period is the most identifiable 
date by which to measure the duration of 
pregnancy, and occurs approximately two 
weeks before conception or fertilization. 
The vast majority of countries in this 
international survey of abortion laws use 
gestational age to measure duration of preg-
nancy. Over 80 percent of countries main-
taining some restriction on elective abortion 
use gestational age as the method of calcu-
lating duration of pregnancy. However, a mi-
nority of countries measures duration of 
pregnancy from ‘‘conception’’ or ‘‘fertiliza-
tion.’’ One country measures from the time 
of ‘‘implantation,’’ which occurs approxi-
mately one week after conception or fer-
tilization. Some statutes do not even specify 
a method of measurement, simply using the 
vague term ‘‘weeks of pregnancy’’ without 
indicating a precise method measuring the 
duration of pregnancy. 
Conception or fertilization is the moment 
when an ovum and sperm unite, which cre-
ates a unique human organism. The date of 
conception or fertilization is often difficult 
to determine, as few women know the exact 
date they conceived. Because the last men-
strual period is a more ascertainable date, in 
many cases doctors add two weeks to the 
woman’s last menstrual period to approxi-
mate the date of conception or fertilization. 
This report uses gestation to compare re-
strictions based on duration of pregnancy. 
More than 80 percent of countries already 
use gestation in establishing duration of 
pregnancy restrictions on elective abortion

and measuring the age of the unborn child 
using gestation is in line with common med-
ical practice. 
For those countries that use a different 
measurement of age, such as conception or 
fertilization or pregnancy, this study con-
verts the measurement of age into gestation 
by adding two weeks to date back to the 
woman’s last menstrual period. Using gesta-
tion as a common method of measuring dura-
tion of pregnancy restrictions on elective 
abortion produces a more meaningful com-
parison. 
INTERNATIONAL GESTATIONAL LIMITATIONS ON 
ELECTIVE ABORTION 
The sample group of countries for this 
project included a total of 198 countries, 
independent states, and semi-autonomous re-
gions with populations exceeding 1 million. 
Of these 198 countries, independent states, 
and regions worldwide, 59 allow abortion 
without restriction as to reason, otherwise 
known as elective abortion or abortion on 
demand. 
The remaining 139 countries require some 
reason to obtain an abortion ranging from 
most restrictive (to save the life of the 
mother or completely prohibited) to least re-
strictive (socioeconomic grounds) with var-
ious reasons in between (e.g., physical 
health, mental health). 
Of the 59 countries permitting elective 
abortion: 
9 countries limit elective abortion before 
the 12th week of gestation, 
36 countries limit elective abortion at 12 
weeks gestation, 
6 countries limit elective abortion between 
12 and 20 weeks gestation, 
7 countries permit elective abortion past 20 
weeks or have no gestational limit. 
1 country maintains a federal system 
where abortion policy is determined at the 
state/territory level, and at least two of 
those states permit elective abortion past 20 
weeks 
Australia is the one country where a fed-
eral system is in place, but abortion policy is 
determined on the state or territory level. 
Three states or territories within Australia 
permit elective abortion, and two allow elec-
tive abortion past 20 weeks. However, other 
states and territories of Australia maintain 
more restrictive abortion policies and some 
do not permit elective abortion at all. Due to 
the diverse range of abortion policy in Aus-
tralia, from restrictive to ultra-permissive, 
this study does not include Australia, as a 
whole, as a country that permits elective 
abortion past 20 weeks. 
More than 75 percent of the countries per-
mitting abortion without restriction as to 
reason do not permit elective abortions past 
l2 weeks gestation. 
Only 12 percent (7 out of 59) of the coun-
tries permitting abortion without restriction 
as to reason permit elective abortion past 20 
weeks gestation. 
The U.S. is among these 7 countries that 
permit elective abortion past 20 weeks. This 
is true whether 20 weeks is measured from 
the last menstrual period (gestational age), 
conception, or implantation. No matter how 
duration of pregnancy is measured, whether 
by gestational age or conception or fertiliza-
tion, or implantation, all countries in this 
category pass the 20-week threshold. These 
countries/territories are: 
Canada (no restriction in law) 
China (no restriction in law) 
Netherlands (24 weeks) 
North Korea (no restriction in law) 
Singapore (24 weeks) 
United States (viability) 
Vietnam (no restriction in law) 
The United States is within the top 4 of 
most permissive abortion policies in the 
world (7 out of 198) when analyzing restric-
tions on elective abortion based on duration 
of pregnancy. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR CURRENT POLICY IN THE 
UNITED STATES 
Under U.S. law, abortion on demand is per-
mitted without restriction through viability. 
Viability can vary, and is decreasing in 
terms of weeks of gestation as perinatal 
medicine advances, but normally occurs no 
earlier than 24 weeks. 
Recently, in the United States there has 
been great interest in restricting abortion on 
demand after 20 weeks. Two states have had 
20-week laws on the books since before Roe 
v. Wade. Eleven more states have enacted 20- 
week laws in recent years. A proposed 20- 
week law in Albuquerque, New Mexico failed 
to gain majority support in 2013 but was no-
table for the engaged citizen activism that 
resulted in the proposal being put on a mu-
nicipal ballot for a direct vote. 
There is also interest at the federal level in 
restricting elective abortion after 20 weeks. 
In 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed a 20-week law. A similar law has been 
introduced in the U.S. Senate. 
Permitting abortion on demand past 20 
weeks places the United States among the 
top 4 percent of most-permissive countries in 
the world based on duration of pregnancy re-
strictions on abortion. If the United States 
adopts a federal policy restricting elective 
abortion past 20 weeks, or if more states 
adopt such policies, the U.S. will more close-
ly align itself with the international norm 
that limits elective abortion past 12 weeks. 
Policies imposing gestational limits on elec-
tive abortion have been overwhelmingly 
adopted by countries permitting abortion on 
demand, indicating policies that encourage 
woman’s safety in limiting abortion to early 
pregnancy and policies that protect unborn 
children from pain and prolonged exposure to 
the risk of-abortion. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In terms of gestational limits, the United 
States ranks among 7 countries with the 
most permissive abortion policies. The clear 
norm among countries that permit elective 
abortion is to limit abortion to before 20 
weeks gestation, and elective abortion is 
more commonly limited to 12 weeks (the 
first trimester). 
Twenty-week abortion laws in the United 
States are neither extreme nor unreasonable. 
Rather, they move the United States closer 
to international norms of legislating what is 
safe and healthy for the mother and what 
grants unborn children more protection in 
the womb. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask all my colleagues on 
every seat in every aisle of this Cham-
ber to vote against this extreme, rad-
ical, and cruel abortion bill, H.R. 8296. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG), who is a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, exactly 
3 weeks ago, five Justices on an activ-
ist, extremist Supreme Court handed 
down a decision that upended nearly 50 
years of precedent and rolled back fun-
damental rights for millions of Ameri-
cans. 
In the weeks since, I have watched in 
horror as State after State has trig-
gered laws that now prevent a woman 
or a girl from accessing an abortion 
even in the case of rape and incest. 
These events have been shocking to 
Americans, not only for millions of 
women across the country but for the 
country as a whole. 
You call yourselves conservative. We 
are talking about 50 years of precedent 
in our Nation. 
Because no Government has a place 
interfering in the decisions between a 
woman and her doctor, criminalizing 
abortion, 
or 
restricting 
women’s 
healthcare options. 
This is not a controversial position 
to the American people. A strong ma-
jority of my constituents believe that 
the right to an abortion should be pro-
tected by law. This is a freedom and a 
privacy issue, and the government—not 
politicians in this room and not politi-
cians in any State in our Nation— 
should not have any part in this con-
versation at all. This is a very personal 
decision between a woman, her family, 
her doctor, and her faith. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to join me in voting 
‘‘yes’’ to protect Roe today. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from the State of Washington (Ms. 
SCHRIER). Dr. Schrier is also a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I will 
tell you, my constituents are up in 
arms. They are emailing me, and they 
are calling my office outraged that the 
freedoms that they have had for 50 
years are being stripped away from 
women in one-half of the States in this 
country. They are furious when they 
hear about victims of rape not being 
able to end a pregnancy and when they 
see a 10-year-old girl who has to flee to 
a neighboring State so she won’t be 
forced to carry a pregnancy to term—a 
10-year old. 
This is barbaric. My constituents are 
worried about what might come next in 
our home State of Washington. 
I am the only pro-choice woman doc-
tor in all of Congress. In fact, I am a 
pediatrician. And I have been in the 
exam room with teens facing un-
planned pregnancies and with mothers 
who find out that the pregnancy they 
are so excited about is not a viable one. 
These 
are 
deeply 
personal 
cir-
cumstances. Frankly, when, whether, 
and under what circumstances to be-
come a mother is the single most im-
portant decision a woman will ever 
make, and that must be hers to make. 
The government has no place in the 
exam room. 
Today I am voting to make sure that 
every woman—no matter where she 
lives—can access abortion, to plan 
their pregnancies, protect their health, 
and chart the course of their lives. I 
want my constituents to know I will 
fight every day to protect their rights. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH) who spent his life defending the 
voiceless.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6641 
July 15, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, the rank-
ing member, for her eloquent defense of 
the unborn child and their mothers be-
cause there are two co-victims in every 
abortion: mother and baby. I thank her 
for her leadership. It is extraordinary. 
Madam Speaker, according to the 
January 2022 Marist Poll, only 17 per-
cent of Americans believe that ‘‘abor-
tion should be available to a woman 
any time she wants one during her en-
tire pregnancy.’’ 
When Americans were asked in late 
June—June 28 to 29—in a Harvard/Har-
ris Poll, a nationwide poll supervised 
by Mark Penn—and many of us know 
him; he is a very effective pollster— 
and the question was put: ‘‘Do you 
think your State should allow abor-
tions up to 9 months’’ only 10 percent 
said ‘‘yes.’’ 
H.R. 8296 would legally authorize and 
enable the violent death of unborn 
baby girls and boys by dismemberment, 
beheading, forced expulsion from the 
womb, deadly poisons, or other meth-
ods at any time and for any reason 
until birth. 
Don’t believe it? 
Read section 4 of the bill. It couldn’t 
be clearer. 
This bill is far outside the American 
mainstream and goes far beyond Roe v. 
Wade. 
As a matter of fact, when the Har-
vard/Harris Poll asked whether or not 
we should be doing what we are doing 
today in Congress, they found—and I 
was a little bit astonished by this— 
that less than one-third of voters—31 
percent—say that abortion laws should 
be federally set by a congressional 
vote. 
Let me point out to my colleagues 
because mention was made of this ear-
lier in the debate. Let me be clear, 
abortion is not healthcare unless one 
construes the precious life of an unborn 
child to be analogous to a tumor to be 
excised or a disease to be vanquished. 
This legislation constitutes an exis-
tential threat to unborn children. 
Since Roe v. Wade, approximately 631⁄2 
million babies have been killed by dis-
memberment, chemical poisoning, and 
beheading—a number that equates with 
the entire population of everyone liv-
ing in the country of Italy. 
If enacted, this bill would nullify al-
most every pro-life restriction ever en-
acted by the States, including parental 
involvement laws in 37 States and pain- 
capable unborn child protection laws in 
19 States. 
I remember when a woman from Vir-
ginia formed a group called Mothers 
Against Minors’ Abortion. That mom 
found out about her daughter’s abor-
tion when she was hemorrhaging in her 
bed. She came and testified before Con-
gress and said: Please, we need to 
know. We love our daughters. Parental 
notification laws do work. 
Sadly, these will be nullified by this 
bill. 
For decades abortion advocates have 
gone through extraordinary lengths to 
ignore, trivialize, or cover up the bat-
tered baby victim. But today, thanks 
to ultrasound, unborn babies are more 
visible than ever before. Today science 
informs us that birth is an event—al-
beit, an important one—but only an 
event in the life of a child. Life is a 
continuum. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to oppose this bill. The youngest pa-
tients and their mothers need protec-
tion. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), 
who is a member of our committee. 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Women’s 
Health Protection Act and to speak for 
the generation of women who have lost 
their freedom to make healthcare deci-
sions for themselves. The government 
has no place inserting itself into peo-
ple’s personal healthcare decisions. 
I never expected to be on the floor of 
the House talking about miscarriage, 
ectopic pregnancy, or fertility treat-
ments, but here we are. 
For many, pregnancy is not an easy 
path. One in eight pregnancies end in 
miscarriage, and 1 in 50 women experi-
ence ectopic pregnancies—an outcome 
that always leads to pregnancy loss 
and poses serious risk of life to the 
mother. 
b 1015 
For countless others, getting preg-
nant requires costly, exhausting, and 
complex procedures such as IVF. 
Regardless of the circumstances, re-
productive health is private. 
Pregnancy can be unpredictable. The 
government has no place in deciding 
what care patients can receive and doc-
tors 
can 
administer. 
Like 
all 
healthcare, decisions surrounding re-
productive health should be between a 
patient and their doctor. 
As an adoption attorney, I worked 
with hundreds of birth mothers making 
the most personal, consequential deci-
sions of their lives, and not one of 
those women looked to the government 
to make that decision for them. 
I support the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act, and I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time remains on 
both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 13 min-
utes remaining. The gentlewoman from 
Washington has 16 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ESHOO), the chair-
woman of our Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in the strongest support possible of the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. 
In February 2020, I held the first leg-
islative hearing in two decades to pro-
tect access to reproductive health. 
Since then, we have seen the steady 
rollback of abortion rights in Repub-
lican-controlled States. This means 
that low-income women and minorities 
have been living in a post-Roe reality 
for years now. 
Now, the Supreme Court has fully re-
voked the constitutional right to abor-
tion, leaving States to outlaw and 
criminalize abortion if they choose to. 
This devastating decision has created a 
patchwork of States with differing laws 
and restrictions, causing societal chaos 
and confusion across our country. 
It is a huntdown of women. It is a 
huntdown of women. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
makes sure that every American has 
equal 
access 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare, no matter where they live. 
I am eager to vote for this legislation, 
once again, and I call on my Senate 
counterparts to codify these vital pro-
tections into law. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE), a member of the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
and 
another 
medical provider. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I rise today in opposition to this leg-
islation that would legalize abortion on 
demand up until the moment of birth. 
As a physician, I first swore an oath 
to do no harm. As legislators, we can-
not, in good conscience, vote to pass 
legislation that would claim the lives 
of unborn children in late-term abor-
tions. 
This poorly written legislation would 
put our Nation alongside countries like 
China and North Korea by allowing dis-
criminatory abortions based on sex, 
based on race, even based on disability. 
This is unacceptable, and it is gut- 
wrenching that Congress would even 
consider passing such legislation. 
This abortion on demand act would 
override pro-life laws passed in our 
States and prohibit State-level elected 
officials from passing legislation to 
protect unborn children in our commu-
nities. 
It is time for all Members of Congress 
to vote against this poorly written bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. It is 
time for all Members of Congress to 
vote against this poorly written bill. I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the

articles, 
‘‘Democrats 
Launch Ads in Lifestyle Mags in All

Caller and ‘‘Ohio Right to Life Says Of-
fices Targeted Twice by Pro-Abortion

[From the Daily Caller, July 13, 2022] 
DEMOCRATS LAUNCH ADS IN LIFESTYLE MAGS 
IN ALL OUT PUSH FOR ABORTION 
(By Mary Rooke) 
The 
Democratic 
National 
Committee 
(DNC) launched a digital ad campaign Tues-
day in several lifestyle magazines telling 
readers that Republicans want to outlaw 
abortion nationwide. 
The DNC purchased at least $10,000 in dig-
ital ads in over 20 lifestyle publications to 
focus on abortion rights issues as the mid-
terms approach, the Associated Press re-
ported. 
Magazines 
like 
Teen 
Vouge, 
Elle, 
Refinery29, Essence, GQ, Esquire, Men’s 
Health, Cosmopolitan and Glamour, hosted 
the DNC’s ads, reported the AP. 
The ad showed Republican Kentucky Sen. 
Mitch McConnell next to blue, pink, and 
white lettering that read: ‘‘Republicans are 
pushing to ban abortion nationally. Join us 
in fighting back,’’ according to the report. 
The DNC is looking to launch a separate 
abortion-centered ad campaign with plans to 
spend six figures, reported the AP. 
The DNC’s ads promoting a ‘‘week of ac-
tion’’ to defend abortion are in response to 
the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to over-
turn Roe v. Wade, sending abortion law-mak-
ing back to the state legislatures. 
‘‘With this Defend Choice Week of Action, 
we’re giving people across the country a 
chance to turn their anger into action by 
holding anti-choice Republicans accountable 
and helping to elect Democrats,’’ DNC chair 
Jaime Harrison said, according to the AP. 
The DNC held a virtual launch for its ‘‘all- 
hands-on-deck effort to defend choice’’ on 
Tuesday 
night, 
according 
to 
the 
DNC 
website. 
‘‘This fight isn’t over and we need all 
hands on deck. This event will serve as the 
kickoff for our Week of Action, which we’ll 
highlight how to get involved with on the 
call,’’ The DNC event description stated. 
The latest Associated Press-NORC poll re-
leased Friday showed that only 16% of Amer-
icans feel abortion is the biggest issue facing 
the U.S. In comparison, 40% of U.S. adults 
said they were more worried about inflation 
and 33% said gas prices, according to the 
poll. 
The survey polled, 1,053 adults nationwide 
from June 23–27 with a margin of error of 
+/¥4.0%.

OHIO RIGHT TO LIFE SAYS OFFICES TARGETED 
TWICE
BY
PRO-ABORTION
VANDALS
WITH 
ROCKS, SPRAY PAINT 
(By Emma Colton) 
Dozens of pro-life centers have been tar-
geted across the country since a leaked Su-
preme Court draft opinion signaled Roe V. 
Wade would be overturned In May, followed 
by the nation’s highest court ultimately rul-
ing as such in June. 
For one pro-life organization in Ohio, it 
has been targeted twice since last month. 
‘‘As pro-lifers, we know that our work 
might cost us something and that very well 
could be our physical safety,’’ the executive 
director of the Right to Life of Northeast 
Ohio Allie Frazier told Fox News Digital. ‘‘I 
think that it’s important in moments like 
this for the pro-life movement to be really 
clear that we’re not going to be intimidated. 
We will save babies. We will protect women. 
And we’re not going to let threats of vio-
lence stop us from doing that.’’ 
Offices for the Right to Life of Northeast 
Ohio were most recently targeted on July 8, 
Frazier said, when al least one suspect was 
caught on camera lobbing rocks at the build-
ing, breaking windows and spray-painting 
menacing messages. 
‘‘If abortion isn’t safe, neither are you,’’ 
the suspect, who was seen wearing a face 
mask, scrawled on the sidewalk of the of-
fices. The phrase has been spray-painted at 
similar offices across the country, often by 
members of pro-abortion extremist group 
Jane’s Revenge. 
Frazier said it’s likely that Jane’s Revenge 
is behind this attack, noting that among 
other spray-painted messages, the name 
‘‘Jane’’ was written on the ground. 
‘‘I think It would be easy for a situation 
like this to be a copycat scenario. But as far 
as I’m concerned, if any pro-abortion indi-
vidual decides to take that next step, to take 
that bad step, and use violence against pro- 
lifers, that is something that I am going to 
work hard to protect my staff against,’’ she 
said. 
The incident was reported to the Akron 
Police Department, Frazier said. The Akron 
Police Department has not responded to 
multiple Fox News inquiry requests on the 
matter. 
Frazier said that the damage caused by the 
vandalism 
was 
‘‘significant,’’ 
but 
‘‘undoable,’’ noting that repairs were being 
made to the broken windows as she spoke to 
Fox News Digital. 
‘‘I know that the intention of this attack 
was to stop us. It was to stop our peaceful 
activism. It was to stop the ways that we are 
impacting women and babies in this commu-
nity for a positive. And they didn’t even stop 
that. I was already back to work in my office 
within a few hours,’’ she said. 
It was the second time the offices were tar-
geted, Frazier said. Activists posted pro- 
abortion posters at the office on June 24, the 
day Roe was officially overturned, hung a 
coat hanger on an office door knob, and rang 
a Ring security camera before flashing a 
middle finger to the camera, according to 
Frazier. 
She said that the attacks pro-life centers 
have recently faced should ‘‘100%’’ be inves-
tigated as hate crimes. 
‘‘(Pro-abortion vandals] are not afraid of 
using violence to get what they want. This is 
absolutely a threat against the peaceful pro- 
life movement. And we do ask that law en-
forcement and local, state, and federal lead-
ers continue to lead the way and say, ‘Hey, 
violence is never okay,’ ’’ she said. 
Pro-life activists have repeatedly called on 
Presiden1 Biden to forcefully condemn the 
attacks on pregnancy centers and churches, 
including Frazier who called on the president 
to not ‘‘be complicit in this violence.’’ 
‘‘Regardless of how people feel on the issue 
of abortion, everybody should be able to con-
demn acts of violence against peaceful non-
profits. Whether that’s an advocacy organi-
zation like Right to Life of Northeast Ohio, 
or a pro-life pregnancy center that are lit-
erally meeting the needs of women and ba-
bies in crisis,’’ she told Fox News Digital. 
The White House has previously con-
demned the violence at pro-life centers but 
has come under scrutiny for not doing more. 
‘‘Instead of supporting and defending more 
pro-life 
pregnancy 
centers 
that 
provide 
health care and support to women at every 
stage of life, President Joe Biden and the 
Left are working to dismantle the work of 
these amazing centers. They won’t strongly 
condemn the violence and threats pregnancy 
centers are facing,’’ the Republican House 
Energy and Commerce Committee posted on 
Tuesday, demanding Biden ‘‘MUST condemn 
the violence and threats.’’ 
Dozens of pro-life centers have faced at-
tack since May, including a pro-life Chris-
tian pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, 
that was allegedly ‘‘firebombed,’’ and a preg-
nancy center in Dearborn, Michigan, that 
saw every ‘‘window and door along the front 
face of our building’’ smashed. 
Jane’s Revenge has taken responsibility 
for a handful of the attacks and declared 
‘‘open season’’ on pro-life pregnancy crisis 
centers in a letter published last month. 
‘‘We offered an honourable way out,’’ the 
letter read. ‘‘You could have walked away. 
Now the leash is off. And we will make it as 
hard as possible for your campaign of oppres-
sion to continue.’’ 
But to Frazier, the pro-life movement will 
remain unchanged and committed to pro-
tecting women and babies. 
‘‘We must be willing to do what it takes to 
protect women and babies and be ready to 
take any backlash from that . . . Don’t be 
afraid. We got this,’’ she said of her message 
to pro-life Americans, adding that pro-lifers 
can also reach out to their local pregnancy 
centers to check in on staff and see if they 
need any additional resources. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE), who is co- 
chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding, for his work, and for bringing 
this bill to the floor. 
Let me also take a moment to thank 
our good friend, a great leader, Con-
gresswoman JUDY CHU, for her vision 
and her persistent leadership, and 
Chairman PALLONE for bringing this to 
the floor, once again. 
Last month’s Supreme Court decision 
is having devastating impacts across 
the country. Now, I remember the days 
before Roe, and now that the Court has 
ended Roe, we are truly in a state of a 
national health emergency. 
Abortion bans affect everyone, but 
their impact falls hardest on folks who 
face serious barriers to care and al-
ready have these barriers presented be-
cause of the lack of equity in our 
healthcare system—women of color, 
people working to make ends meet, 
rural people, young people. 
It is terrifying now that people could 
be criminalized for exercising their 
own 
personal 
healthcare 
decisions. 
That is wrong. It is morally wrong. 
Already, across this country, people 
are unable to get care and are denied 
the freedom to make their own deci-
sions about their health and about 
their futures. Our personal liberties 
and our freedoms are being taken 
away. This is just another step in the 
erosion of our democracy. 
It has never been more critical than 
now that we pass legislation to protect 
the right to access abortion and ensure 
that abortion and comprehensive re-
productive healthcare are accessible 
and available for all. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, Roe be-
came law when I was 13. For my entire 
adult life, the right to abortion care— 
to privacy and the freedom to make my 
own family planning and healthcare de-
cisions—was 
guaranteed 
in 
all 
50 
States. It sickens me that it is not the 
case today. My daughters-in-law, my

July 15, 2022 
granddaughters, and all women and 
girls have been stripped of human 
rights and relegated to second-class 
citizens. 
After a decades-long effort, Repub-
licans have fixed the Supreme Court 
with a few Justices corruptly seated by 
an autocratic President, and they now 
behave not as constitutional lawyers 
but as theocrats. 
In overturning Roe and sending a 
woman’s reproductive freedom to State 
politicians—largely White, male—these 
Justices 
have 
decided 
their 
faith 
should 
determine 
everyone 
else’s 
rights, not the Constitution. 
This is a call to the Chamber, to this 
Chamber, to the Senate, to the admin-
istration. We must restore, expand, and 
protect rights. We must pass laws that 
combat 
this 
regressive, 
shrinking 
Court. No excuses. 
That is why we are here, yet again, 
with legislation to codify the right to 
abortion care. 
Last September, the House passed 
the Women’s Health Protection Act, 
and the Senate sat on its hands. Today, 
we must pass it again. 
I will return to the floor every ses-
sion, with Representative CHU
and 
many others, until we protect and ex-
pand rights. I ask my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BUCSHON), a doctor who understands 
what amazing technology is doing to 
save lives. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 8296. 
First, I would like to say, as a physi-
cian, my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle need to focus on what their 
bill really does. Stop talking about ec-
topic pregnancies, which are a surgical 
emergency; fetal demise, where, for un-
known reasons, the fetus has passed 
away; and miscarriages, which, clearly, 
in many cases, are surgical emer-
gencies and are tragic. That is not 
what this bill is about. 
I have heard claims the bill only 
codifies provisions of the now-over-
turned Roe v. Wade decision. That is 
simply not true. H.R. 8296 would create 
a national standard to allow abortions 
at any time up until birth. 
As a practicing heart surgeon for 15 
years prior to coming to Congress, I op-
erated on children in the neonatal in-
tensive care unit as young as 23 weeks 
gestation. Even at 650 grams, or 1.4 
pounds, and about 6 inches long, I saw 
life in my tiny patients’ little bodies. 
This abortion on demand until birth 
act bill doesn’t only allow abortions at 
any point in the pregnancy. It would 
also preempt and repeal State laws 
that 
require 
informed 
consent, 
ultrasounds, or other testing and coun-
seling before undertaking an elective 
abortion. 
The American people deserve to 
know the facts about what is really in 
this bill. I find it troubling the sup-
porters of this bill, most of whom have 
never taken care of a patient, continue 
to mislead the American people about 
what constitutes healthcare. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I want to begin to acknowledge the 
pain that people have experienced in 
the wake of being stripped of their 
rights and being thrust into legal 
limbo. 
We have already seen the impact this 
horrific decision has had on increased 
wait times in clinics, and doctors 
forced to consult with lawyers because 
of State restrictions, while patients 
may be dying on operating tables. 
The barbaric treatment of the 10- 
year-old child, a victim of rape, made 
into a media circus, and the prospect of 
the doctor who provided her care being 
subjected to legal action. 
We know the Supreme Court has put 
us all on the wrong side of history. 
These appalling stories reinforce the 
fact 
that 
denying 
fundamental 
healthcare has dire and unforeseen cir-
cumstances far beyond the slogans that 
have been bandied around. 
I believe it is our duty to take re-
sponsibility to make progress in even 
these difficult circumstances to pro-
vide a path forward. This legislation 
does that. 
We owe it to American families to 
make progress, to protect them and 
improve access to this right, and spare 
them government intrusion into the 
most sensitive and personal matters. 
Our rage must be productive. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
WALBERG), another defender of life. 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, my 
heart breaks today. I say that sin-
cerely. My heart breaks to hear the 
words of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, who I respect highly 
for many reasons, who disregard the 
fact that we are talking about life. 
On this floor, we have talked about 
the need for formula this morning for 
the same babies we are talking about. 
We have heard our Speaker many times 
imploring us to do it for the children. 
Who are we talking about today? 
It breaks my heart to think that my 
colleagues don’t trust women to make 
decisions about life before life is con-
ceived. It breaks my heart to think 
that we don’t hold men accountable to 
make decisions to love our girls and 
women. 
It breaks my heart that we would say 
this is a human right to take life when 
our 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
brought us into being with unalienable 
rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness. 
We are better than this. We have had 
50 years of death. Think about the over 
100 years before that we applauded life. 
Madam Speaker, it is time for us to 
stand for individuals taking respon-
sibilities that God has made us capable 
of, to decide for the best interests of 
others, including those little children. 
Why is the safest place on Earth 
today the maternity ward nursery in a 
hospital, but not the womb? 
We must change. H.R. 8296 is a bill of 
death, and it is a bill that takes away 
responsibility for us, as adults, to do 
what we must do. 
b 1030 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the 
chairman of our Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
the 
distinguished 
chairman, 
Chairman PALLONE, for his leadership 
in this critically important area, as 
well as Representative FLETCHER for 
leading the charge in an area that is 
significantly important and consistent 
with the values of this great country; a 
country that embraces life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness, land of the 
free, and home of the brave, liberty and 
justice for all. 
But liberty, justice, and freedom are 
under assault right now because of a 
radical, rightwing, illegitimate Su-
preme Court majority and their ex-
treme 
co-conspirators 
here 
in 
the 
House of Representatives attacking 
freedom. 
But this legislation and House Demo-
crats are going to do everything in our 
power to defend a woman’s freedom to 
make her own reproductive healthcare 
decisions, a woman’s freedom to make 
a deeply personal decision that should 
be between a woman and her doctor, 
not extremists trying to intervene, and 
her freedom to make the decision to 
travel to seek abortion care whenever 
and wherever is necessary. 
Those are the stakes. That is why 
this legislation is so important, and we 
will always defend these freedoms. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN), a defender of free-
dom, a defender of life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness for all. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding the time. 
Last month, our Constitution was 
upheld at the Supreme Court, and 
States like Oklahoma took immediate 
action to protect the lives of the un-
born. 
This shouldn’t be a hard vote. It is 
the right for children, fully formed in 
the womb, to be born. 
Our allies and like-minded nations 
around the world do not allow abor-
tions up to the moment of birth, as 
this bill would do. It is simply bar-
baric. My colleagues know it is an un-
popular position, which is why they 
have resorted to lies and deceptions 
about lifesaving care for pregnant 
women. 
Madam Speaker, I urge every Mem-
ber of this Chamber to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
H.R. 8296 and protect the right of our 
future generations to be born.

H6644 
July 15, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his extraordinary support. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today because 
I am pretty damn angry. You know the 
Supreme Court’s decision overturning 
the right to abortion care is fundamen-
tally wrong. The Supreme Court green- 
lit forced pregnancy, taking away the 
right to bodily autonomy for women. 
Abortion is still healthcare. People 
will still need to access it, and that is 
why I am supporting the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. 
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, we 
have a State-by-State patchwork that 
denies women equal protection under 
the law. 
While abortion is still legal in my 
home State of North Carolina, the 
State of Texas is suing the government 
to compel women to carry pregnancies 
to term, even if it kills the mother. 
The attorney general of Indiana 
wants to force rape victims—even 10- 
year-old girls—to carry pregnancies to 
term. 
We have a responsibility to stop this 
draconian overreach by State govern-
ments, and we have got to make repro-
ductive 
freedom—reproductive 
free-
dom—the law of the land. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time is remaining in this de-
bate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Washington has 101⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from New Jersey has 41⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS), a defender of life. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yielding 
time. 
You know, as we hold this debate, I 
remember back to a morning as a 
young resident at Parkland Hospital 
starting out in a residency in OB/GYN 
and our major professor, our depart-
ment chairman, Jack Pritchard, ad-
dressing us and telling us that starting 
into a career in OB/GYN, we were in a 
unique position in medicine. 
Every time we took a case, either as 
a primary doctor or consultant, we 
would have the unique opportunity to 
be taking care of two patients who had 
a combined life expectancy of over 100 
years. 
He said nowhere else in medicine are 
you going to be able to affect the fu-
ture to the degree that you can as an 
OB/GYN. 
In nearly 30 years of practice back in 
Texas, I have taken care of women 
with ectopic pregnancies. We did it be-
fore. We will continue to do it. It is a 
surgical emergency, and you don’t shy 
away from it. 
Unfortunately, some pregnancies do 
conclude in a miscarriage, and some of 
those do require the attention of a phy-
sician. I would not hesitate to do that, 
then or now. 
But what I would not do and could 
not do was disrupt a viable pregnancy 
where a child could issue from that 
care. None of that changes, either be-
fore or after the Supreme Court deci-
sion. 
Look, there have been times when I 
have had to step in when someone had 
care at another facility and sought ref-
uge in my emergency room because of 
severe complications they were having 
from an abortion done elsewhere. 
I would have to step in and correct 
the problems from the abortionist. I 
didn’t hesitate to do that and will con-
tinue to do it in the future, but what I 
will not do is end a life in a pregnancy. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
Women’s Health Protection Act which 
will provide—in law—the right for peo-
ple to make their own reproductive 
healthcare decisions. 
The Supreme Court’s Dobbs opinion 
overturning abortion rights is infuri-
ating, it is heartbreaking, and it is 
dangerous. 
For almost 50 years, the intensely 
personal decision about whether to 
bear a child or have an abortion was 
where it belongs—with the person who 
is pregnant. 
I remember the days before Roe v. 
Wade when abortions done without 
medical care could, and often did, have 
tragic consequences. 
Colleagues, make no mistake: Over-
turning Roe will not end abortions. 
Make no mistake: Taking away the 
right to abortion care will dispropor-
tionately hurt families and individuals 
who are already struggling, and dis-
proportionately hurt people in rural 
areas who will struggle to get the care 
they need. 
My colleagues, if you believe life be-
gins at conception, don’t get an abor-
tion. But that is a belief, it is not 
science, and others do not share it. 
I don’t think anyone over here would 
ever force someone with your beliefs to 
get an abortion, but you are forcing 
your beliefs on others, and that is 
wrong. 
We need to restore personal freedom 
and put the decision about whether or 
when to bear a child back where it be-
longs. 
Today, I will enthusiastically vote 
for the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE), another defender of 
life. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding time. 
‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their creator 
with certain unalienable rights, that 
among these are life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness.’’ Life. 
Abortion is a termination of that life 
and a grave human rights abuse, and it 
must end. No one has the right to end 
the life of an innocent human being. 
The government has a duty to protect 
that right to life. 
Since 1973, more than 63 million un-
born babies have had their lives cut 
short. That is a tragedy and simply un-
acceptable, and I stand here for the 
sake of millions of children, for the 
sake of the integrity of our Nation. 
Let’s follow the science. Preborn hu-
mans are, in fact, humans and deserv-
ing of life. But, unfortunately, the pro- 
abortion left has decided that ‘‘human’’ 
doesn’t automatically grant that right 
and that humans should only be ac-
corded human rights depending on 
their location, level of dependency, or 
size. 
That mindset is a travesty, and the 
practice of abortion will go down in 
history as a great stain on this Nation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER), a defender of life. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the Democrats’ extreme pro-abor-
tion agenda. 
Today, I am voting against two bills 
that go far beyond Roe v. Wade, which 
is the decision to move these types of 
unenumerated decisions to the State 
level, as the Constitution clearly says, 
backed up by the Supreme Court. 
But what my Democrat colleagues 
are pushing would permit elective 
abortions, up to and including a baby’s 
due date, an extreme position legal-
izing abortion based on the child’s 
race, sex, or disability. Tragic. 
Another of their initiatives opens up 
dangerous loopholes for child traf-
fickers to cover up their crimes by 
forcing victims to receive abortions 
across State lines, and it criminalizes 
those who might encourage delaying an 
abortion, 
including 
parents 
or 
healthcare providers. Parents. 
Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, 
Democrats at all levels, including the 
White House, have spread misinforma-
tion and fear surrounding the decision. 
Presenting the killing of a child as a 
woman’s only avenue to success in her 
career or life is inhumane and wrong. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to vote against these 
bills. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank all of the leaders who recognize 
that reproductive freedom is a con-
stitutional right. 
I rise today, and I stand in the name 
of a 10-year-old rape victim who was 
denied an abortion and had to run to 
another State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6645 
July 15, 2022 
I stand in the name of the young 
woman who induced an abortion and 
became criminalized. 
I stand in the name of rape victims. 
I stand in the name of incest victims. 
I stand for reproductive freedom. 
And I stand in the name of the Con-
stitution and the Ninth Amendment 
and the right of women with their faith 
leaders, their families, their extended 
knowledge, to be able to make their 
own decision about reproductive free-
dom. 
I stand for the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act because it prohibits a 
State, local, or Tribal Government 
from telling abortion providers that 
they should perform medically unnec-
essary procedures like ultrasounds and 
provide patients with medically inac-
curate information. This would be pro-
hibited by this particular legislation 
and, as well, to ensure that they would 
comply with credentialing or other 
conditions that do not apply to pro-
viders who offer medically comparable 
services. 
I stand in order for the Women’s 
Health Protection Act to cover this 
United States and to ensure that the 
Constitution and Ninth Amendment 
prevails. 
I stand because the Supreme Court 
Justices who swore that they believe in 
precedent for 50 years of Roe v. Wade 
did, under oath, misrepresent to those 
who they were speaking to that they 
would adhere to stare decisis and the 
precedent. 
I stand because in Texas, the bounty 
hunters are seeking to criminalize and 
arrest persons. I stand for H.R. 5710 
that will criminalize that activity. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8296, the Women’s 
Health Protection Act of 2022. 
H.R. 8296, the ‘‘Women’s Health Protection 
Act of 2022’’ of which I have been a long-time 
supporter, would prohibit certain government 
restrictions on access to abortion. 
The bill would ensure physicians’ ability to 
prescribe certain drugs, offer abortion services 
via telemedicine, and provide immediate abor-
tion services when the mother’s health is at 
risk. 
Furthermore, the ‘‘Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act of 2022’’ would put an end to the hur-
dles some states have placed in the way of 
women accessing abortion care. 
This bill would prohibit state, local, or tribal 
governments from requiring abortion providers 
to: 
Perform medically unnecessary procedures 
like ultrasounds; 
Provide patients with medically inaccurate 
information or; 
Comply with credentialing or other condi-
tions that do not apply to providers who offer 
medically comparable services. 
It would also safeguard all abortions before 
fetal viability, and after fetal viability when a 
physician determines the continuation of preg-
nancy puts the mother’s life at risk. 
Under this bill, patients would not be re-
quired to disclose the reasoning behind their 
decision to receive an abortion, nor would they 
be forced to attend medically unnecessary 
health visits before their procedure appoint-
ment. 
In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 
decision to revoke the reproductive rights that 
women have enjoyed for half a century, Con-
gress must act now to enshrine what is left of 
women’s liberties into law. 
I stand in proud support of both H.R. 8296, 
the ‘‘Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for women 
and girls and the providers who meet their 
medical needs every day. 
We cannot let those who wish to relegate 
women to second-class citizens turn back the 
clock any further. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ar-
izona (Mrs. LESKO), a strong defender 
of life, who is on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 8296 because Re-
publicans care about women and ba-
bies. 
My colleagues across the aisle are 
unfortunately, once again, attempting 
to push their abortion on demand agen-
da, which most Americans find appall-
ing. 
This bill is beyond extreme. It per-
mits abortions on demand for any—any 
reason, up until the moment of birth. 
Eighty percent of Americans say that 
abortion should be illegal in the third 
trimester, and for good reason. The 
methods used in late-term abortions to 
end the life of the preborn baby are 
truly reprehensible. 
b 1045 
The bill before us today almost com-
pletely undermines the numerous pro- 
life laws that States have enacted since 
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 
Roe v. Wade by imposing a national 
standard for abortion on demand. 
As a mother and grandmother, I can 
tell you that preborn babies are un-
questionably human lives, and they are 
lives worth defending. 
I find it ironic that the party that 
tells us to follow the science denies 
basic science that says life begins at 
conception, that the first signs of a 
heartbeat can be detected after just 22 
days, and that preborn babies can feel 
pain as early as 12 weeks inside the 
womb. 
Passing this legislation would be a 
stain on Congress. Women deserve bet-
ter than this, and so do their preborn 
babies. Preborn babies are truly the 
most 
vulnerable 
and 
defenseless 
amongst us. We were elected to defend 
Americans’ rights, and yet this Con-
gress seeks to deny vulnerable per-
sons’, babies, the most basic right, the 
right to life. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, so I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), another defender of life. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, a great defender 
of life, for yielding me this time, and I 
stand for life today. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 8296, the so- 
called Women’s Health Protection Act, 
is proof that the left wants to ensure 
limitless, 
taxpayer-funded 
abortion. 
This is truly outrageous, and the vast 
majority of Americans do not support 
abortion without limits. 
It is stunning that Congress is wast-
ing its time on legislation that is so 
out of touch with the people it rep-
resents. What we should be focusing on 
is helping women and protecting the 
innocent lives of babies. 
For that reason, I rise today to offer 
a motion to recommit to instead con-
sider H.R. 619, the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act. 
Across the country, abortion pro-
viders are denying care to infants born 
alive after attempted abortions. We are 
talking about children who have al-
ready been born. We are talking about 
infanticide. 
Congress must act to protect inno-
cent, defenseless babies who cannot 
protect themselves. The Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act is 
compassionate legislation that does 
just that. This bill simply ensures that 
babies who survive attempted abor-
tions receive the same standard of care 
that any newborn should receive. 
It would require healthcare providers 
to exercise skill, care, and diligence to 
preserve the life and health of these 
children and then immediately trans-
port and admit them to the hospital. 
It would impose penalties on pro-
viders who purposefully fail to give 
medical care to these babies. 
It would bar criminal prosecution of 
the mother. 
But most importantly, it would save 
lives. 
Coming to Congress, I knew there 
would be a lot of difficult conversa-
tions about the life of the unborn, but 
I am truly shocked and heartbroken 
that I have to stand here and defend 
lifesaving care for babies who have al-
ready been born. 
Madam Speaker, we can, and we 
should make every effort to protect the 
lives of newborn babies. 
To my colleagues, this is the sim-
plest vote you will ever have to take. 
Either you support babies being denied 
lifesaving healthcare after they are 
born, or you do not. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I continue to re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 11⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentlewoman from 
Washington has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6646 
July 15, 2022 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, abortion is the 
sharpest, most soul-searching question 
before us as a Nation. It pierces every 
heart. People have strongly held beliefs 
and stories, and both sides are guilty of 
dismissing one another. 
For those of us who stand for the 
right to life, we must do a better job of 
listening and loving. Fear and despair 
lead to more arguments, anger, dis-
cord, and insecurity. 
The abortion on demand bill, this bill 
before us today, though, is extreme. It 
is abortion for any reason, at any stage 
of pregnancy until birth. It is not the 
will of the American people. 
I recently spoke with a doctor who 
shared with me what is possible today. 
It is American technology and medical 
technology that allows us now to do 
surgeries inside the womb. 
I am a mom of three young kids, and 
anyone who has given birth knows that 
to be able, because of technology, to 
see the baby develop day by day is just 
amazing. 
Doctors are performing prenatal sur-
geries and treatments to save lives. 
This doctor was telling me they can 
perform a prenatal surgery on 20 dif-
ferent organs. That wasn’t possible in 
1973 when Roe v. Wade was decided. In 
fact, the first successful fetal surgery 
wasn’t until 1982. 
Many decades later, look how far we 
have come. Science has evolved. It is 
my hope that we learn from this and 
that we reject abortion because it is 
unthinkable. It is not following the 
science. It doesn’t reflect the latest re-
search or modern medicine. Reject this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s extreme and dangerous deci-
sion in Dobbs turns back the clock and 
jeopardizes the health, well-being, and 
autonomy of women across the Nation. 
Access to comprehensive healthcare 
must include access to abortion, and 
the ability to access care should not 
depend on where you live. 
The bill before us, the Women’s 
Health Protection Act, restores a right 
to an abortion nationwide, ensuring 
that all Americans, regardless of where 
they live, can make their own decisions 
about their lives and their futures. 
I urge my colleagues across the aisle 
to support this bill. While Republicans 
seek to punish and control women by 
criminalizing 
abortion 
nationwide, 
House Democrats will continue our 
fight to restore the right to abortion as 
the law of the land. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1224, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.

mittee on Energy and Commerce or 
their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and add extraneous material on 
H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to Abor-
tion Act of 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 8297, the Ensur-
ing Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act, introduced by Represent-
ative FLETCHER, a member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Last month, when the Supreme Court 
overturned a woman’s constitutional 
right to abortion, it also gave license 
to extreme Republican politicians to 
pass dangerous laws across the Nation. 
These 
State 
laws 
criminalize 
healthcare and create an environment 
of fear for healthcare providers or any-
one else assisting someone who needs 
an abortion. 
Already, abortion bans are in effect 
in 9 States, and more are expected 
soon. Republican politicians and anti- 
abortion extremists are also actively 
considering even more actions. They 
want to prevent private citizens from 
legally crossing State lines to obtain 
an abortion. They also want to depu-
tize private citizens to track down any-
one who might help a woman legally 
obtain an abortion in another State. 
These actions clearly violate the 
Constitution and the right to travel 
freely, and this legislation will put 
those States on notice that their ac-
tions to limit their citizens from ob-
taining the healthcare they need can-
not be enforced. 
H.R. 8297 reaffirms the right to travel 
across State lines to obtain a lawful 
abortion. It protects healthcare pro-
viders who provide lawful abortion care 
to out-of-State residents, and it pro-
tects anyone who may assist a woman 
in crossing State lines to obtain a law-
ful abortion, such as a friend, partner, 
or volunteer. 
Madam Speaker, the bill also pro-
hibits individuals acting under State 
law from restricting or impeding ac-
cess to medication abortions, which 
States are rushing to restrict despite 
the clear authority of the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Madam Speaker, while we need the 
Women’s Health Protection Act to be-
come law to restore access to abortion 
in all 50 States, we must also mitigate 
some of the extreme and dangerous 
laws Republicans are enacting now to 
prevent women from making their own 
healthcare decisions. 
This legislation does that, which is 
why I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Ac-
cess to Abortion Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6648 
July 15, 2022 
Just like the Democrats’ abortion on 
demand until birth act, this bill is part 
of an extreme agenda to nationalize 
abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy. 
Abortion is a false choice between tak-
ing care of a woman and taking care of 
a baby. 
What a woman needs is support. 
Every life is meaningful, and our ac-
tions are significant. Seventy-six per-
cent of women seeking an abortion say 
that they would choose life if their cir-
cumstances were different. 
Instead of promoting ways to support 
women 
and 
children 
with 
better 
healthcare, education, financial sta-
bility, 
and 
changing 
their 
cir-
cumstances, 
Democrats, 
including 
President Biden, are spreading fear, 
anxiety, and misinformation. This is a 
blatant attempt to spread fear and 
present abortion at any stage of preg-
nancy as a woman’s only option. 
So I will be very clear: 
It is already unconstitutional to pre-
vent a woman from traveling between 
States. 
The pro-life movement does not sup-
port and has always rejected criminal-
izing and punishing women, period. 
State laws currently in effect have 
exceptions to save the life of the moth-
er. 
And pro-life laws do not prevent 
women from getting care they need in 
cases of miscarriages and ectopic preg-
nancies. 
Regarding this legislation, the En-
suring Access to Abortion Act, I have 
many 
questions 
and 
concerns. 
Its 
vague language, designed to promote 
more abortions, undermines parental 
consent for minors, opens loopholes for 
abuse, and eliminates medical super-
vision for chemical abortions. 
This bill does nothing to explicitly 
prevent an unrelated adult or a sexual 
abuser from taking a minor out of 
State for an abortion without parental 
consent. It would prevent healthcare 
professionals, 
social 
workers, 
and 
schools in every State from reporting 
instances of child abuse, sexual abuse, 
and neglect because they could be seen 
as delaying or hindering access to abor-
tion. 
b 1100 
It also undermines parent rights. 
Parents can be targeted by the Federal 
Government and sued for wanting to 
help their child just by asking them to 
delay traveling to get an abortion. 
If their child is 16, for example, the 
parents lose power to protect their 
teenager from being coerced by an 
older man to get an abortion. 
The Ensuring Access to Abortion Act 
undermines the health and safety of 
women by preempting State laws regu-
lating the practice of medicine. It over-
rides the majority of States that have 
determined it is safest for doctors to 
prescribe pills for chemical abortions. 
This puts women and minors in danger 
if they experience complications. 
Finally, these same provisions give 
sexual abusers and human traffickers 
more direct access to chemical abor-
tions in all 50 States and ensures that 
doctors in States like California, where 
there is no parental consent, can effec-
tively become pill mills by prescribing 
and mailing abortion drugs to children 
and minors and end lives all over the 
country. 
This is extreme. 
Again, I ask my colleagues to aban-
don this agenda for unlimited abor-
tions with no restrictions. It only pro-
motes more fear, pain, and dehuman-
ization of the most vulnerable, the 
helpless among us. 
Instead, let’s come together. Let’s 
come together around human rights of 
every person in this country, the born 
and unborn. Let’s celebrate the dig-
nity, the value, and the potential of 
every person. This is our chance to lead 
a new era of hope and healing in our 
country for every person, for moms and 
babies at every stage of life. 
Every life is worth living. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER), the spon-
sor of this legislation. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, in 
my beloved home State of Texas, we 
are in a crisis, a healthcare crisis, a hu-
manitarian crisis. 
Since last September, access to abor-
tion has been severely limited. Since 
last month, it has been eliminated. 
In response, Texans who can do so 
have been traveling out of State to ob-
tain abortion care, first to Oklahoma, 
Louisiana, and New Mexico. As some of 
these States have banned abortion, 
they are now traveling even farther. 
Now, in response to this exercise of 
their constitutional right to travel be-
tween the States, lawmakers in Texas 
and in other States across the country 
are threatening to take away that 
right, too. 
This is not hypothetical, it is not hy-
perbole, and it is nothing like what we 
just heard from the minority in re-
sponse to this bill. 
Just last week, a group of lawmakers 
in Texas publicized a letter that they 
sent to at least one law firm in Texas 
threatening the firm and each of its 
partners with felony criminal prosecu-
tion and disbarment because of the 
firm’s policy to reimburse employees 
for travel costs associated with out-of- 
State travel for abortion care. 
It is not just Texas. Lawmakers in 
Missouri have already considered legis-
lation to prohibit its residents from 
traveling outside of the State for abor-
tion care to States where it is legal, 
and groups are working on model legis-
lation to introduce in States across the 
country as we speak. 
Not only do these threats fail to re-
flect the will of the majority of people 
in this country who favor a legislative 
framework that takes into account the 
complex circumstances of pregnancy 
that we have discussed this morning, 
these threats fail to reflect the funda-
mental rights guaranteed in our Con-
stitution. 
Congress has the authority and the 
responsibility to protect people from 
these unconstitutional efforts to pre-
vent, restrict, impede, or otherwise 
punish a person traveling to another 
State to obtain a legal abortion and to 
protect those providers and others who 
are helping them. 
This morning, we are doing exactly 
that in passing the Ensuring Women’s 
Right to Reproductive Freedom Act. 
I thank the chairman, the Speaker, 
original 
cosponsors 
Representative 
STRICKLAND
and 
Representative 
RASKIN, and all of our cosponsors for, 
once again, responding with urgency to 
the cruel efforts to deprive my fellow 
Texans and our fellow Americans of 
their constitutional right to travel by 
bringing this bill to the floor today, 
and I urge everyone in this body to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. 
FLORES), a new Member just elected 
from the great State of Texas, the first 
Member who was born in Mexico, and a 
great member of our Republican Con-
ference. 
Mrs. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address my strong opposition 
to H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to 
Abortion Act. 
Protecting the voiceless ought to be 
a top priority in this House and in 
every corner of this land. 
As a mother of four beautiful and 
strong children, I find it hard to be-
lieve there are those who think defend-
ing life is optional, even to the last 
month of pregnancy. 
H.R. 8297 is the opposite of what 
brought me to Congress, and it is the 
opposite of the values of the people of 
my district, Texas 34. 
Let’s be clear what this bill does: Un-
dermines the ability of States to hold 
sexual 
abusers 
accountable, 
stops 
States from preventing abortion pill 
mills, and it gives human traffickers 
and abusers more direct access to 
chemical abortions in all 50 States. 
Protecting life shouldn’t be political. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 8297. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Eshoo), the chair-
woman 
of 
our 
Subcommittee 
on 
Health. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman of our committee for his 
leadership. 
I rise in strong support of this legis-
lation. It is aptly named, Ensuring 
Women’s Right to Reproductive Free-
dom Act. 
I have listened to the debate so far on 
this bill, and I really find it hard to be-
lieve what I am hearing. I think the 
people of this country need to know, 
before we get to the reproductive free-
doms, that the Republicans are opposed 
to contraception. That is a fact around 
here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6649 
July 15, 2022 
Now, because of what the Supreme 
Court has unleashed with the Dobbs de-
cision, we have a patchwork of States 
with different laws. Some States pro-
vide full healthcare for women; others 
don’t. 
Now, those living, as the author of 
this legislation stated, in Texas, they 
are fleeing Texas to go to other States; 
but those States want to stop women 
from traveling. That is what this is 
about. Stop women from traveling. 
What are they going to do? Put their 
Highway Patrol on the border to inter-
view people to find out where they are 
going and why? This is extreme in 
terms of what these States want to do. 
Today, the House, in its votes, makes 
it crystal clear to those States that 
they cannot take this freedom away. 
This bill establishes protections for 
women who travel for care and for 
healthcare professionals who provide 
that care. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, just to clarify, not a 
single legislature or Congress is debat-
ing making contraception illegal. Con-
traception is not abortion. It prevents 
conception. The scare tactic about 
making contraception illegal is an-
other scare tactic by the Democrats to 
advance a radical abortion agenda to 
end life up until 9 months. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER), 
a member of our committee. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Ensur-
ing Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act. In the wake of the over-
turning of Roe v. Wade, this legislation 
is necessary to ensure that those in 
States that have restricted abortion 
care can travel across State lines to 
seek the care they need and not be 
criminalized for doing so. 
I am proud that women in my home 
State of Delaware still have access to 
abortion care and that we can serve as 
a safe haven for those from other 
States. 
But the reality for far too many peo-
ple across the country is that they live 
in States where access to reproductive 
care has been so severely restricted 
that it is unavailable. While the bills 
we are voting on today are necessary, 
we must also confront the realities of 
what overturning Roe means. 
Now, my middle name is Blunt, so let 
me be clear about who is going to be 
hit the hardest: poor women, young 
women, women in rural areas, and 
women of color, people who may not 
have the ability to travel hundreds of 
miles to get the care they need. 
Madam Speaker, I was 10 years old 
when the landmark case of Roe was de-
cided. Half a century later, I am stand-
ing on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, standing in the gap for 
doctors and healthcare providers, so 
that they don’t have to consult with a 
lawyer before they decide to give good 
care to their patients, standing for 
those who stood before us and fought 
for us to have this right for reproduc-
tive rights in the first place. I am 
standing for our young people so that 
our 
daughters 
and 
granddaughters 
don’t need a health passport to travel 
from State to State or need to worry 
about being criminalized for seeking 
care. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
of the House to support both the Ensur-
ing Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act and the Women’s Health 
Protection Act. The bottom line: There 
is no room for politicians in our 
wombs. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER), a strong defender of the 
right to life. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to share my con-
cern for the extraordinary lengths that 
my colleagues across the aisle will go 
in order to rip away a chance at life 
from unborn children. 
H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to 
Abortion Act, is a deceptive ploy to 
circumvent the authority of States to 
set their own laws about abortion pro-
cedures or, more plainly, the proce-
dures that violently end an unborn 
child’s life. 
On June 24, the Nation received his-
torical news from the highest court in 
the land that Roe v. Wade had been 
overturned. This decision was an an-
swer to nearly 50 years of prayer and a 
decision that rights a wrong that was 
committed in the very same court al-
most half a century ago. 
The Supreme Court ruling verified 
that our Constitution gives no protec-
tions for abortion procedures. Abortion 
was never a constitutional right, and 
that has been the big lie to millions of 
women for the past 50 years. It was de-
termined that this decision should not 
be mandated by Washington but chosen 
by the people through their State legis-
latures. 
The Ensuring Access to Abortion Act 
is not only a blatant attempt to under-
mine State sovereignty; it also opens 
the door to incredibly dangerous con-
sequences. 
For one, the bill would restrict en-
forcement of State laws that require 
physicians to be present when chemical 
abortions are administered. This super-
vision is a safety measure to ensure 
that a patient does not have an ectopic 
pregnancy, which could lead to fatal 
consequences. 
The primary pillar of the pro-life 
movement is that all life is precious. 
We must consider the health implica-
tions of women who receive an abor-
tion or partial procedure across State 
lines and return to their home State in 
need of dire medical attention. 
Women who have abortion procedures 
face a myriad of increased risks that 
can occur later. Sterilization, mis-
carriage, and tubal pregnancies are not 
uncommon. 
Are we to assume that the responsi-
bility for treatment of these subse-
quent health risks falls on the State 
whose laws were circumvented? Be-
cause that is what would ultimately 
happen. 
And as a woman in Congress, I urge 
my colleagues to look at how this leg-
islation puts at-risk minors and women 
in vulnerable positions. The language 
in this bill is so vague that it makes no 
consideration for abusers, those abus-
ers that transport minors across State 
lines to receive abortions after their 
abuse. 
We can’t afford to be vague and allow 
blanket protection for anyone assisting 
in an abortion. We cannot be that 
naive, especially when these proce-
dures have life and death consequences. 
b 1115 
To be clear, not a single State has 
banned interstate travel for women 
seeking abortion. This bill isn’t about 
protecting women from the State; it is 
about dramatically restricting States 
from protecting their citizens and forc-
ing pro-life States to absorb the burden 
of safety complications that follow the 
superseding of their protective meas-
ures. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to think about the damaging 
consequences. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentle-
woman an additional 1 minute. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to 
think 
about 
the 
damaging 
con-
sequences of taking power from the 
States. Not only does it set a dan-
gerous precedent of Federal overreach 
and taking power from the people, but 
it also has terrifying health implica-
tions for expectant mothers and at-risk 
youth, and the protection of bad ac-
tors. 
I will always be a steadfast defender 
of an unborn child’s right to live, and I 
will never back down from a fight to 
protect women and those unborn chil-
dren. We cannot put both at risk with 
this damaging legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who 
chairs our Consumer Protection and 
Commerce Subcommittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I lived the days before abortion was 
safe and legal in the United States of 
America, and I remember the despera-
tion of women, some of them my 
friends, some of whom had to make 
really dangerous decisions about how 
they were going to be able to exercise 
control over their own bodies and make 
this most personal decision on their 
own. Some women died because they 
sought these dangerous methods on 
their own to end a pregnancy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6650 
July 15, 2022 
Let’s be clear: Roe v. Wade wasn’t 
the beginning of women having abor-
tions; it was the end of women dying 
from abortions. 
Abortion is healthcare. When Roe v. 
Wade finally became the law of the 
land, women were able finally to con-
trol their own bodies. 
This bill is about freedom, and one of 
the most precious freedoms that we 
have is the freedom to travel from 
State to State in the United States of 
America. 
What happens to the woman who is 
happily pregnant and who may be 
going to visit her family in Illinois, 
where, thank God, abortion is still 
legal? Are you going to check her out? 
Is she going to have to prove somehow 
that she is not going for an abortion? 
How are you going to enforce this with-
out going into all the personal history 
of women who are traveling across 
State lines? 
Enough is enough. In the United 
States of America, the right to travel 
is sacred. It is protected under the 
Commerce Clause, and we will not go 
back. Women will not go back. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE), our whip and a strong de-
fender of life. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman, the ranking 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
for leading on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this radical movement by 
our colleagues on the left to go way 
further than Roe, under the guise of 
codifying Roe, to push some of the 
most extreme packages of pro-abortion 
legislation that we have seen. 
Where would this push us if they got 
their way? Under this package of bills 
that the House is taking up today, the 
United States would end up among just 
a handful of countries, including China 
and North Korea, in radical abortion 
on demand up until birth policy. 
Now, there has been a lot of misin-
formation presented since the Supreme 
Court made their decision, a decision 
that I applaud because, Madam Speak-
er, it is a decision that finally said Roe 
was a flawed decision and that, in fact, 
elected leaders should be the ones de-
bating this. 
How much can we debate how to pro-
tect life? States have been having this 
debate. Roe didn’t end the debate. It 
started a movement, a movement for 
almost 50 years. The March for Life. 
You see young people, tens and hun-
dreds of thousands, coming up to Wash-
ington, just praying and marching for 
the opportunity to protect life. Now, 
those States and Congress can have 
that debate about how much more we 
can do to protect life. 
In fact, we brought an amendment 
because whether it was before the 
Dobbs decision or even today, a State 
like New York has such a radical law 
that a baby can be born alive outside 
the womb, and they can murder that 
baby and call it abortion. That is still 
legal today in States like New York. It 
should not be. It is murder. If a baby is 
born alive outside the womb, how in 
America can that baby be murdered 
under the guise of abortion? Yet, that 
is what is allowed. 
We had the motion to recommit we 
brought forward—we will have a vote 
on that shortly—to say that barbaric 
act can no longer happen again in 
America, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors 
Protection 
Act. 
Everybody 
should vote for that. People pro-choice 
have said they think it is radical that 
a baby can be born alive outside the 
womb and still be murdered under the 
name of abortion. 
We will have the opportunity to right 
that wrong today on the House floor. I 
hope everybody votes for it. Unfortu-
nately, so far, we haven’t gotten any 
support 
from 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues. 
I will end with this, Madam Speaker: 
Our Founding Fathers empowered us 
with three unalienable rights, life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. The 
first among those is life. Let’s do all we 
can to protect life, not have this rad-
ical, extreme agenda pushed forward 
today. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, this 
new post-Roe reality that we are living 
with is still sinking in for most of us, 
but if you are a woman who is pregnant 
now and needs to end that pregnancy, 
and you are in one of the States that 
has outlawed abortion, every day is 
filled with panic and horror, trying to 
figure out how to get the care you 
need. This is a crisis. 
Now, politicians in some of those 
States are threatening to criminalize 
travel to another State for abortion 
care and to criminalize doctors and 
anyone else who might help, for exam-
ple, with transportation. This is out-
rageous. 
Such extreme laws are nothing less 
than an attack on women—on our au-
tonomy, on our freedom, on our health, 
and on our privacy. These are back-
ward positions. They are extreme and 
draconian. 
The decision to have an abortion is 
one for a woman to make in consulta-
tion with her doctor—no one else, defi-
nitely not politicians. 
As a doctor, I have been in the room 
with women making the extremely dif-
ficult and personal decision about 
whether to end a pregnancy. Politics 
has no place there. I have been in the 
room with a woman with an ectopic 
pregnancy for whom abortion is the 
standard of care. 
Let’s be clear, State laws that crim-
inalize abortion and also criminalize 
travel across State lines for abortion 
put doctors in an impossible situation 
and put women at risk. 
As a doctor, I took the Hippocratic 
Oath to ‘‘first, do no harm,’’ and I want 
you to think for a moment about the 
harm of a delayed or more complicated 
abortion, or that ectopic pregnancy, or 
the harm of having a rape victim carry 
a pregnancy to term, or the rates of 
maternal mortality in this country. 
Make no mistake. These bans are 
draconian. Banning travel is extreme, 
controlling, and dangerous. Women 
will die because a bunch of politicians 
decided that they should be in charge 
of women’s bodies. This is reprehen-
sible. 
I will keep doing everything I can to 
protect women’s access to abortion no 
matter where they live, and I implore 
my House and Senate colleagues to 
pass these bills. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
STEUBE) to continue our fight for 
human rights for all. 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, let 
me address the complete misrepresen-
tations of fact that we have been hear-
ing from Democrats since Roe has been 
overturned. 
There has never been a constitu-
tional right to end the life of an inno-
cent, unborn child—never. It doesn’t 
exist in the Constitution, and Congress 
has never passed a law allowing for the 
murder of the unborn. In fact, the op-
posite exists. 
In the Fifth and 14th Amendments to 
the Constitution, there is a constitu-
tional right for any person to not be 
deprived of life, liberty, or property. 
Certainly, an unborn child is a per-
son. What else could it be? Therefore, 
that person shall not be deprived of life 
pursuant to the Constitution, period. 
Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court got 
it right and made it clear that ‘‘the 
Constitution does not confer a right to 
abortion.’’ 
Over 63 million children have been 
murdered since Roe was decided. That 
is not freedom. That is genocide. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his extraordinary lead-
ership on this subject not only as we 
face the Court decision but, over time, 
his chairmanship of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee in terms of 
health in general, women’s health in 
particular, reproductive health as we 
gather today. I thank members of the 
committee, and I thank the authors of 
this legislation as I proceed. 
I rise on this momentous day as our 
pro-choice, pro-women Democratic ma-
jority proudly takes further action to 
defend the fundamental right of health 
freedom. 
As extremist Republicans continue 
their assault on reproductive rights, 
our Ensuring Women’s Right to Repro-
ductive Freedom Act will ensure that 
the fundamental right to travel and ob-
tain needed healthcare remains in the 
hands of the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6651 
July 15, 2022 
Our Women’s Health Protection Act 
will once again make the protections 
of Roe v. Wade the law of the land. 
Let us salute the patriotic and per-
sistent leadership not only of our dis-
tinguished chairman, Mr. PALLONE, but 
also Congresswoman LIZZIE FLETCHER 
and Congresswoman MARILYN STRICK-
LAND, who are leading the charge on 
the right-to-travel bill, working with 
JAMIE RASKIN, who is a member of the 
Judiciary Committee and who has been 
part of this. 
I also salute Congresswoman JUDY 
CHU, who will have now twice secured 
House passage of the Women’s Health 
Protection Act; Pro-Choice Caucus co- 
chairs DIANA DEGETTE and BARBARA 
LEE; and Energy and Commerce Chair-
man FRANK PALLONE. 
Three weeks ago, the Republican 
Party finally achieved its dark, dan-
gerous, long-held goal to rip away a 
woman’s freedom over her most funda-
mental decisions about her body, her 
health, and her life. 
Since the Republican-captured Su-
preme Court eviscerated Roe v. Wade, 
at least nine Republican-controlled 
States have already banned abortion. 
More have enacted draconian restric-
tions so that exercising this funda-
mental right is practically impossible. 
In doing so, these extreme measures 
have forced countless women to seek 
reproductive care in nearby States. But 
now, Republican lawmakers across the 
country are advancing proposals to 
block women from crossing State lines 
to get the care they need and punish 
those who, in their words, ‘‘aid or 
abet’’ them. 
Is this the United States of America, 
where Republicans in these States can 
say to women, ‘‘You cannot cross State 
lines for your own good health?’’ 
This has been especially devastating 
for women who do not have the means 
to access care, often women of color 
and women from low-income commu-
nities. 
This reality is sickening. It is des-
picable. It demands action. 
With our Ensuring Women’s Right to 
Reproductive Freedom Act, we will 
prevent Republicans from punishing 
women for exercising their right to 
travel and receive the healthcare they 
need, and it will protect healthcare 
providers 
who 
deliver 
reproductive 
services and all those who help women 
make the journey to receive those serv-
ices. This means no criminal charges, 
no lawsuits, no fees or fines, no threats 
of retaliation. 
Importantly, this legislation also re-
affirms the right to travel, a freedom 
we often take for granted but is funda-
mental to liberty and privacy. 
Republicans supposedly once stood 
for these values, but today, they are 
seeking to restrict where you can go 
and who you can see and to stand be-
tween you, your family, your doctor, 
and your God in making intimate 
health decisions. 
This is not only anti-women; it is 
anti-American. House Democrats are 
fighting back. 
Madam Speaker, today, our majority 
will also pass the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act, which protects the right 
to an abortion found in Roe v. Wade, 
ensuring 
the 
Federal 
right 
of 
healthcare providers to provide repro-
ductive care and the Federal right for 
patients to receive that care. 
By passing this legislation, we will 
preempt and prevent State-level bans 
and restrictions put forth by extremist, 
anti-women State legislators. 
b 1130 
We will ensure that all Americans 
enjoy the same fundamental rights to 
reproductive care—regardless of back-
ground or ZIP Code. 
We offer help to the American people 
who treasure our freedoms and who are 
overwhelmingly with us in our mission 
to defend them. 
What do Republicans have in store 
next? 
You can’t travel to buy a book? 
You can’t travel to see a concert or a 
play—if it doesn’t meet their, shall we 
say—I wouldn’t use the word stand-
ards—their what? 
Today, we must pass this legislation 
for a second time. We first passed this 
bill last September after Texas se-
verely restricted the ability of women 
to access reproductive care with SB8, 
an outrageous bounty hunter bill. We 
do so again today, in the wake of the 
outrageous Supreme Court ruling that 
erased the vital protections of Roe v. 
Wade. 
The Court’s disgraceful decision has 
already unleashed catastrophe: women 
denied care after experiencing the 
heartbreak of miscarriage; survivors of 
sexual assault facing the possibility of 
forced birth; doctors under threat of 
persecution for offering reproductive 
services. 
Many of these situations are well- 
known and are publicized—they are in 
the public domain. There are many 
more than are just in the public do-
main. Make no mistake, eviscerating 
the protections of Roe was only the 
opening act of the cruel Republican 
crusade to criminalize women. 
In recent days, we have heard again 
of the tragic story of a young girl who 
was a survivor of sexual assault and 
had to travel to a neighboring State to 
receive the reproductive healthcare she 
needed. Now, the State attorney gen-
eral—a Republican who served here in 
the House—is now investigating the 
doctor who legally provided her serv-
ices. She is 10 years old. This move is 
intended to intimidate healthcare pro-
viders and produce a chilling effect on 
access to reproductive care. 
The Republican agenda is not just a 
threat to families in red States. House 
Republicans’ overwhelming opposition 
to our legislation make clear that they 
do not want anyone to access reproduc-
tive 
care 
anywhere. 
Indeed, 
their 
endgame is a barbaric ban on abortion 
in all 50 States. 
As the Associate Justice Clarence 
Thomas said, they have only just 
begun in terms of their restrictions in 
terms of contraception and the rest. 
They will not stop there. These ex-
tremists are even threatening to crim-
inalize birth control, in vitro fertiliza-
tion, and post-miscarriage care. 
Democrats will never stop fighting 
back against this extreme assault be-
cause we know that every woman ev-
erywhere has the basic right to repro-
ductive healthcare. 
Right now, the rights of women and 
every American are on the line, Madam 
Speaker. 
House Democrats are ferociously de-
fending freedom with these two impor-
tant bills. We need two more Demo-
cratic pro-choice Senators so that we 
can eliminate the filibuster and make 
this legislation the law of the land. 
Madam Speaker, as the radical Re-
publican Party seeks to wind back the 
clock 
of 
50 
years 
of 
hard-fought 
progress, I am reminded of an extempo-
raneous debate in which I participated 
as a high school student. 
A young woman, a friend of mine, 
drew a question from a bowl on a slip 
of paper that read: Do women think? 
Today, it seems that some wish to 
debate that same question: the extrem-
ist Republican assault on women’s 
rights harkens back to this darker 
time. 
Do women think? 
Indeed, because of Donald Trump, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, and a radical right-
wing 
Republican 
Party, 
and 
their 
supermajority in the Supreme Court, 
right now American women have less 
freedom than their mothers. 
By 
passing 
this 
legislation, 
the 
Democratic House is standing on the 
side of freedom for women and for 
every American. 
The young lady who drew the insult-
ing question answered that question 
with grace and strength, and she won 
the debate. 
Just as Democrats intend to win on 
the question of women’s health and 
freedom, not only here in the Halls of 
Congress, but with the American peo-
ple in November. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a very strong 
vote for the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act and the Ensuring Women’s 
Right to Reproductive Freedom Act. I 
hope we have a strong vote and I hope 
a bipartisan vote. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate a 
record number of pro-life women serv-
ing in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives today and an army of pro- 
life women all across this country from 
every corner, we are fighting for the 
human rights of all, especially the un-
born. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
CAMMACK), one of those mighty war-
riors. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to stop lying. 
Stop lying. Roe did not make abortion 
illegal, it returned the issue to the

States. Now we see that you all want 
to take those rights away from the 
States—strip them, in fact. 
Under this bill that we are consid-
ering here today, you want to take this 
issue further than Roe ever did and 
take away the rights of children, those 
most 
vulnerable. 
The 
notion 
that 
women will somehow be stopped at 
checkpoints, in some 1984 scenario, this 
is insane and political fear-mongering 
at its best. You know that. You know 
that. 
I hear constantly about these ‘‘ex-
treme positions’’ that conservatives 
and those in the pro-life movement are 
taking, but what is extreme is not tak-
ing a stand for the child that survives 
an abortion attempt. That is extreme. 
Denying medical care for that child, 
that is the extreme. 
Madam Speaker, I always say—and 
bless your heart, 36 years of service, 
that is incredible, 2 years longer than I 
have been alive. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, in 
that 36 years of service, Madam Speak-
er, 60 million children have been mur-
dered, with over 30 percent of them 
being minorities, African Americans 
and Hispanics. 
It is curious logic that we murder 
these children to empower them. 
Where were the rights of those 
young, little girls that were murdered? 
They didn’t have a voice. 
Yet here we are debating the fact 
that this is a right. A right? 
No, no, no. This is an issue that has 
gone back to the States. Not an issue 
for us here in this Chamber to be decid-
ing, when we know that this Nation is 
based on life: life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. It starts at life. 
The extreme positions, they are 
being held on that side of the aisle. We 
are a Nation of equal opportunity, not 
equal outcome. We know that abortion 
is equal outcome. Give those children 
the opportunity to live. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this ridiculous 
bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND), 
who is the chief cosponsor of this bill. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the Ensuring 
Women’s Right to Reproductive Free-
dom Act, which my colleagues and I 
wrote to support reproductive choice. 
Simply put, this bill codifies the con-
stitutional right to travel, which in-
cludes the ability to cross State lines 
to get safe and legal access to abortion. 
The reality is that an increasing 
number of women are now forced to ei-
ther carry an unwanted pregnancy 
against their will, even in cases of rape 
and incest, or travel hundreds of miles 
just to safely receive reproductive 
healthcare. 
This is especially dangerous for in-
digenous women, who are 21⁄2
times 
more at risk for rape and sexual as-
sault. We cannot force women to give 
birth. Worse, those forced to carry out 
an unwanted pregnancy are giving 
birth in a Nation with one of the worst 
maternal mortality rates in the devel-
oped world. 
When compared to Canada, United 
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Sweden, France, Germany, Switzer-
land, Australia, and New Zealand, the 
United States’ maternal death rate is 
more than twice the rate of these coun-
tries. 
What is more, Black and indigenous 
women will be among the most at risk 
because they are more likely to die 
from pregnancy or childbirth. They are 
also two to three times more likely to 
experience a pregnancy death than 
their White counterparts. 
If access to safe and legal abortion 
becomes more restricted and inacces-
sible, the Black maternal mortality 
rates are expected to jump by a whop-
ping 30 percent or more. 
All told, taking away Federal protec-
tions for abortion hits Black women, 
indigenous women, women of color, 
low-income women, LGBTQ+ women, 
and women with disabilities the hard-
est. 
This is about healthcare justice. This 
is about social justice. This is about 
economic justice. Taking away our 
right to safe and legal abortion is yet 
another way to try and control us. 
Please listen carefully. Black women 
will not be stopped. Indigenous women 
will not be stopped. Women of color 
will not be stopped. LGBTQ+ will not 
be stopped. Women will not be stopped. 
This bill ensures our right to repro-
ductive freedom by reaffirming the 
constitutional right to travel. Those 
who hold the literal words of the Con-
stitution and so-called States’ rights as 
the absolute standard, you must do one 
thing: you must recognize the constitu-
tional right to travel guaranteed by 
the 14th Amendment and vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill. 
We know you won’t because for you 
this isn’t about the Constitution or 
States’ rights, it is about control. It is 
about controlling women’s bodies and 
forcing people to give birth against 
their will. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
ADERHOLT), another defender of the 
right to life. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for the oppor-
tunity to come and talk about this leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position. It has been noted this morn-
ing, the legislation that we are consid-
ering today doesn’t just reverse the Su-
preme Court’s recent ruling of Roe v. 
Wade, it goes much further. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have assembled this bundle of 
policies in an effort to undermine the 
enforcement of pro-life State laws. 
As the Republican whip just pointed 
out a little earlier, in combination 
with what is called the so-called Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act, it seeks to 
undermine the will of the people, and 
places the U.S. on a short list with 
North Korea and China as countries 
with the most extreme abortion poli-
cies in the world. We don’t want to be 
on a list with those two countries. 
Instead of undermining State law, we 
should be enabling States that have 
chosen to extend the responsibility of 
protecting its citizens to also include 
the unborn. 
The Alabama legislature enacted the 
Human Life Protection Act in 2019, re-
flecting the will of the citizens of the 
State. I cannot allow those voices to be 
silenced by radical Federal abortion 
bills. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this measure that we 
are voting on this morning, and all of 
the extreme measures yet to come at-
tacking the most vulnerable among us. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would ask how much time is remaining 
on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 14 min-
utes remaining and the gentlewoman 
from Washington has 13 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER), the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 8297, the En-
suring Women’s Right to Reproductive 
Freedom Act. 
The Supreme Court’s disastrous deci-
sion in Dobbs to overturn Roe v. Wade 
has exacerbated what was an already 
dire crisis in abortion care access—one 
that threatens to undermine women’s 
equality and health. 
In the wake of the Dobbs decision, 
State legislatures across the country 
are moving to ban abortion outright. 
As if that wasn’t draconian enough, 
some States are also passing laws tar-
geting people who help others obtain 
an abortion. This includes the noto-
rious Texas law, SB8, which permits 
any person to collect a $10,000 bounty 
by suing someone who ‘‘aids or abets 
an abortion.’’ 
Not content to strip women of their 
bodily autonomy and equality in their 
own States, some State legislatures are 
now contemplating efforts to inhibit 
the ability of women to travel out-of- 
state to obtain lawful healthcare, in-
cluding by threatening their friends, 
families, or even employers with legal 
action. 
H.R. 8297 would put State legislatures 
considering such laws on notice by pro-
viding additional Federal legal protec-
tions that reaffirm and enhance en-
forcement of the constitutional right 
to interstate travel, which includes 
travel to obtain legal healthcare serv-
ices like an abortion. 
This legislation is not enough. Many 
people, a disproportionate number from

communities of color, do not have the 
option of traveling across State lines 
because they lack the resources to bear 
the costs of out-of-state travel, which 
include the related costs of childcare, 
lodging, or time off from work. 
b 1145 
That is why it is essential that we 
also pass H.R. 8296, the Women’s Health 
Protection Act of 2022, which would 
protect the right to abortion nation-
wide. The House has already passed 
this bill, but the Senate Republicans 
have twice blocked its passage. This is 
unacceptable. We must do everything 
we can to ensure protection of abortion 
access in a post-Roe world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on both H.R. 8297 
and H.R. 8296. 
But this is not enough either. We 
face a radical Supreme Court delib-
erately packed with extremists by a 
plot by the Federalist Society, by 
MITCH
MCCONNELL, and by Donald 
Trump to pack the Supreme Court with 
extremists who have no regard for our 
liberties and who will destroy every 
liberty we have if we don’t do some-
thing about it. That is why Congress-
man 
JOHNSON, 
Congressman JONES, 
Senator MARKEY, and I have introduced 
legislation to unpack the Supreme 
Court by increasing the number of Jus-
tices by four. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE), who is a member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. Dr. JOHN 
JOYCE is continuing our fight for the 
right to life. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
When I was in medical school, I 
learned about the development and the 
journey of a child in the womb of the 
mother. 
Madam Speaker, let me review that 
journey with you today. At 6 weeks, a 
child is developing a mouth, nose, ears, 
and—most important—a heartbeat of 
their own. At 12 weeks, a baby has fin-
gers and toes. 
Continue on this journey with me. At 
15 weeks, a baby can sense light and 
even has taste buds. At 19 weeks, a 
child can hear and knows the voice of 
their mother. 
These lives are precious, and they 
must be protected. 
By 22 weeks, many babies can survive 
outside the womb if they are born pre-
maturely. 
Clearly, these are human lives. Clear-
ly, we in Congress have an obligation 
to protect these human lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject this bill and support 
all human life. It is time for us to 
stand up for the American people and 
to stand up for all human life. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I was hor-
rified when I heard about the plight of 
a desperate Houston woman. She was 1 
week pregnant beyond Texas’ 6-week 
abortion ban, and with four children al-
ready, she knew she was not in a posi-
tion to have another. So she packed 
her husband and four children in a car 
and drove over 22 hours and over 1,500 
miles to my district in Pasadena, Cali-
fornia, for her abortion. 
Texas’ law forced her into a situation 
no family should ever have to face, and 
the Supreme Court’s overturning of 
Roe has made conditions far worse. 
H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to 
Abortion Act of 2022, will ensure that 
every American has the right to travel 
to seek abortion care. 
Madam Speaker, we will not give up 
in this fight. We will not go back. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS), who is a great member of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yielding 
time. 
In the 1970s it was misleading, but 
pregnancy was described as a clump of 
cells and a lump of tissues. 
How many people listened to that 
and didn’t ascribe the agency to the 
young life that was developing? 
Then medical sonography was just 
coming into its own at the same time 
that Roe was decided; and for two gen-
erations of Americans since then, the 
first picture in their baby book is their 
sonogram picture. 
Is it any surprise that two genera-
tions of Americans now ascribe agency 
to the unborn child because they see 
from whence they came? 
Having an abortion is not a simple 
fix to a problem; it is not a simple pro-
cedure; and it is not birth control. An 
abortion is highly complex, and it is a 
deeply emotional procedure. Obviously, 
it is going to affect the baby, and obvi-
ously, it is going to affect the woman. 
Do you know what, Madam Speaker? 
It even affects the provider. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlemen for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as the doctor has 
just said, this is an extraordinarily 
complex and difficult issue for all. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this bill and the Women’s 
Health Protection Act that we are also 
considering today. 
Three weeks ago today, the United 
States Supreme Court’s unprecedented 
decision reversed nearly 50 years of es-
tablished precedent overturning Roe v. 
Wade and paving the way for trigger 
laws across the country to criminalize 
access to abortion instantly. With this 
ruling, women in 2022 will now have 
fewer rights than their mothers or 
grandmothers and less control over 
their 
own 
bodies 
and 
their 
own 
healthcare. 
Today, the House of Representatives 
is responding to protect the women of 
our country. Today, this House will 
vote to stand with women and affirm 
their freedom to make their own 
healthcare decisions. 
It is not an easy decision, and it is 
not made lightly, but it ought to be 
free from interference from politicians. 
We must do everything, in my view, in 
our power to ensure that women are 
free to travel wherever they need in 
order to access reproductive care safe-
ly, legally, and without fear of punish-
ment. 
That is why I brought to the floor 
this bill, the Ensuring Women’s Right 
to Reproductive Freedom Act. This leg-
islation would prohibit States from 
preventing, impeding, or obstructing 
women from traveling to other States 
for reproductive care or retaliating 
against them for doing so. 
Over a century and one-half ago it 
was legal to own people because of the 
color of their skin. They could escape, 
as Harriet Tubman did and as Fred-
erick Douglass did, from their slavery 
on the Eastern Shore of our State and 
go to a so-called free State. But then, 
tragically, the Congress enacted a bill 
which allowed people to go and reim-
pose slavery on those folks. Let’s none 
of us do the same. 
This 
legislation 
would 
prohibit 
States from preventing, impeding, or 
obstructing women from traveling to 
other States for reproductive care 
where it is legal or retaliating against 
them for doing so. These draconian and 
authoritarian laws that States are 
talking about are going to criminalize 
behavior no matter whether it is legal 
in the State to which you went. 
One of the first bills I voted on in 
1967 when I first went to the State sen-
ate—at that point in time I was about 
8 months out of law school—was to re-
peal the miscegenation statutes which 
said that a Black person could not 
marry a White person or a person of 
Japanese extraction or Chinese extrac-
tion. The Supreme Court held that un-
constitutional. 
It would be like saying: You can go 
to a State where that certainly is legal 
for an African American and a Cauca-
sian to marry, but if you come back 
here, you are going to be a criminal. 
That is draconian, authoritarian, and 
almost Communist-like. It is dictator-
ship that China tried to pursue and did. 
This bill would also extend the same 
protections to healthcare providers 
who perform abortions for out-of-state 
patients and to anyone who helps them 
with transportation. Let us not set up 
a society where people are watching 
their neighbor, reporting 
on 
their 
neighbor, and criminalizing behavior 
which has, for one-half century, been 
the decision of a woman. Yes, she could 
consult her doctor and she could con-
sult others, but it was her body that 
was at stake. It is her decision. 
Additionally, this bill would protect 
the movement in interstate commerce 
of prescription drugs approved by the 
FDA to end pregnancies safely at 
home.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6654 
July 15, 2022 
I am grateful to Representatives 
LIZZIE
FLETCHER, 
MARILYN
STRICK-
LAND, and JAMIE
RASKIN
for intro-
ducing this legislation and to Chair-
man PALLONE for advancing it through 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
so speedily. I also want to thank DIANA 
DEGETTE and BARBARA LEE for their 
leadership on this issue as co-chairs of 
the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus. 
While protecting interstate travel is 
an important step, Congress must do 
much more to ensure that every 
woman in our country can access 
healthcare and reproductive choice 
safely, legally, and affordably. That is 
why we are also considering an updated 
version of the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act today. 
I thank JUDY
CHU, again, for her 
leadership on this effort. 
Make no mistake, Madam Speaker, 
until we codify Roe v. Wade’s 49-year 
precedent in Federal statute, women in 
many parts of our country will not be 
safe or have access to the healthcare 
they need. I am old enough to remem-
ber when it wasn’t legal and when peo-
ple died in back alleys going to char-
latans and did not have proper medical 
care. Let’s not return to those dark 
and tragic days. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, to 
support freedom, and to support the 
women of our country. That is the 
right thing to do. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD), 
who is a great defender of the human 
right to life. 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, the 
pro-life issue used to be a bipartisan 
issue in this Chamber even as we recog-
nized that our essential liberties of life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness 
were inalienable rights given to us not 
by government but by God, and the 
claim that the left is making that our 
attempts to protect life are somehow 
criminalizing women could be nothing 
further from the truth. 
Setting aside the fact that the left 
can’t even define for the moment what 
a woman is, 50 years of scientific evi-
dence have unveiled to us the mystery 
and the amazing thing that is hap-
pening in the development of a child. 
We know so much more—even the fact 
that a child feels the pain of abortion. 
We will always stand with life. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. PETERS), who is a 
member of our committee. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to support the Ensuring Wom-
en’s Right to Reproductive Freedom 
Act. 
After the Supreme Court eliminated 
the Federal right to abortion, only 20 
States continue to protect a woman’s 
right to choose. Even before Roe fell, 
States across the country were work-
ing to pass laws banning abortion even 
in cases of rape, incest, and when the 
life of the mother is at stake. That is 
not pro-family, and that is not pro-life. 
That is barbaric. 
Republican 
efforts 
to 
criminalize 
abortion will pit neighbors against 
neighbors, punish women for exercising 
their bodily autonomy, and imprison 
doctors who took an oath to protect 
their patients. That is happening right 
here in what is supposed to be the 
freest country in the world. That is 
why I am standing here, today, to pro-
tect a woman’s right to travel in 
search of legal healthcare. 
Madam Speaker, if the Supreme 
Court won’t protect Americans, then 
we in Congress must do everything in 
our power to stand up for our basic 
freedoms. That starts with this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to pass it. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON), who is continuing our 
fight for life. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Washington 
State. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle’s efforts to create a national 
policy that allows for terminating a 
pregnancy at any stage, for any reason 
is not only extreme and outside of the 
mainstream of America, it is wholly in-
consistent with our values and the 
founding principles of our great Na-
tion. 
This abortion on demand legislation 
taken together will put us in the dubi-
ous company of the likes of China, 
North Korea, and only five other coun-
tries that I guarantee you, Madam 
Speaker, do not have America’s values. 
I commend the Supreme Court for re-
storing the integrity of the Constitu-
tion and returning power back to the 
States and We the People. 
God bless America, and God bless our 
fellow Americans both born and un-
born. 
b 1200 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LEE), who co-chairs the Pro-Choice 
Caucus. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 8297. 
Yes, as co-chair of the Pro-Choice 
Caucus, along with my colleague, Con-
gresswoman DIANA DEGETTE, I thank 
our 
colleagues, 
Representatives 
FLETCHER, STRICKLAND, and RASKIN, for 
introducing this very important bill, 
and 
also 
Chairman 
PALLONE
and 
Speaker PELOSI for bringing it to the 
floor. 
Everyone deserves the freedom to 
make personal decisions about their 
health, their bodies, their futures, as 
well as the right to travel. Yet, the Su-
preme Court’s decision has stripped 
this fundamental right to reproductive 
freedom from millions of people in this 
country. 
Now, I remember the days before 
Roe, and we aren’t going back. 
Not only are some States moving to 
enact extreme abortion bans, but some 
anti-abortion 
State 
legislators 
are 
working to prohibit people from trav-
eling across State lines to access care 
and are targeting people who assist 
those in need. 
What in the world is happening to 
our democracy? 
First of all, you are trying to take 
away our own healthcare decisions, the 
ability 
to 
make 
our 
reproductive 
healthcare decisions. You are trying to 
criminalize people for making their 
own reproductive healthcare decisions. 
You are trying to set up an environ-
ment for people to spy on each other 
when they are trying to exercise their 
reproductive healthcare decisions and 
freedoms. 
You are trying to take away people’s 
right to travel. 
What in the world is this? Is this 
America? 
You all talk about other countries. I 
don’t even recognize what you are try-
ing to do in this country. 
Please, just know that this is a slip-
pery slope. They come for me today; 
they are coming for you tomorrow. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and to reaffirm 
the right to travel and seek care, not 
further erode our reproductive free-
doms and personal liberties. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, we are working on a 
privacy bill, but that is a separate bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Idaho 
(Mr. 
FULCHER), a great defender of life. 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the proposed Fed-
eral authorization of what amounts to 
be abortion on demand. 
There are reasons the life issue is so 
polarizing. How we prioritize life, from 
before birth to the end of life, often de-
fines our value systems. I believe life is 
the very character of God, that, indeed, 
we all have inalienable rights, the most 
important of which is the right to live. 
I will close my comments by pointing 
out three relevant position statements 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle struggle with. 
All too often, they will support tak-
ing of life of the pre-born by abortion, 
but not taking of life of convicted mur-
derers by capital punishment. 
All too often, they will support the 
statement ‘‘my body, my choice,’’ but 
not when it comes to vaccines. 
And all too often, they will support 
so-called reproductive health, but not 
if it is reproductive or healthy. 
Debates and decisions like these be-
long to the people, not the Federal 
Government. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, a Supreme Court, out 
of touch with the American people,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6655 
July 15, 2022 
says that State legislatures can ban 
abortions and give our most important 
personal decisions to politicians, and 
Republicans are on a mission to do just 
that. 
Madam Speaker, my, my, my, their 
plans are getting crazier and more ex-
treme by the minute. Listen to this: 
National 
anti-abortion 
groups 
and 
their allies, Republican allies in State 
legislatures, are scheming to stop peo-
ple in States where abortions are 
banned from seeking the procedure 
elsewhere. 
As we speak, there is a proposal in 
Missouri, a State that bans abortion, 
that would allow private citizens to sue 
anyone that helps a Missouri resident 
have an abortion in another State. 
They are going to punish doctors, 
Uber drivers, spouses, and the rest just 
for helping a woman who is getting the 
healthcare that she needs. We stop that 
today. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
MAST), a leader defending life. 
Mr. MAST. As all remarks are sup-
posed to be directed to the Chair, 
Madam Speaker, when is a life a life? 
Madam Speaker, when is a life a life? 
I will open it up for the rest of my 
colleagues over there. I would wager 
none of my colleagues on the other side 
will tell us when life begins. I have a 
$20 bill here. It is not worth as much as 
it used to be worth. I will put it down 
here on the table. Any one of you or 
your colleagues wants to speak up and 
tell us when life begins, it is sitting 
here for you. 
Madam Speaker, when is a life a life? 
When does it begin? 
That is the most extreme idea to 
come out of this body, that you won’t 
acknowledge when a life is a life. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, point of 
order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman may state his point of order. 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, did I ad-
dress my remarks to you? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not stating a point of order. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to speak in support of 
H.R. 8297 by my colleague and friend 
from Houston, Congresswoman FLETCH-
ER. 
First, let me be clear. There seems to 
be some fixation from the other side 
that this decision should be left up to 
the States because the Supreme Court 
said that. They need to re-read the 
opinion. It simply says that it is re-
turned to the people and their elected 
Representatives. Last time I looked, I 
was an elected Representative, and we 
all are elected Representatives. 
So, we can pass these two bills today 
and put them in statute and make it 
the law of the land because, I can tell 
you, if we leave it to the States, things 
will be more extreme. 
In my home State of Texas, extrem-
ist Republicans have created a patch-
work that is scary, discriminatory, and 
oppressive, and they are doing that to 
limit our right to make our own deeply 
personal, private healthcare decisions 
about our own bodies together with our 
families and our providers. 
This bill would restore women’s 
rights in Texas and across the country. 
It would stop Republicans from crim-
inalizing, fining, or suing women who 
exercise their constitutional right to 
travel across State lines to obtain an 
abortion. 
This is important since many compa-
nies have announced policies that 
cover travel expenses for employees 
seeking abortion care who are not able 
to get them in their own home State. 
They are threatening businesses in 
Texas that they will throw them out of 
Texas. 
This bill is necessary. We are the 
elected Representatives. We get to de-
cide. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. 
LESKO), a defender of life fighting for 
the right to life. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 8297. 
I heard my Democrat colleagues pas-
sionately state that women will not be 
stopped and that we should support 
freedom. Yet, sadly, these same people 
fail to realize that their own radical 
abortion legislation will, indeed, stop 
women’s rights because their radical 
agenda stops a future woman’s right 
and freedom forever by ending her life. 
If this bill were to become law, 
healthcare professionals would be seen 
as obstructing victims’ access to abor-
tion if they delay the abortion to re-
port this case of child abuse. That is 
not protecting women and girls. 
To make this bill even worse, this 
legislation eliminates medical super-
vision requirements for chemical abor-
tion pills. The FDA deems these pills 
as high-risk drugs that can cause in-
tense pain, excessive bleeding, infec-
tions, and, in some cases, death. This 
means a woman or a little girl could 
literally bleed out without a doctor 
even knowing or being there to help. 
Abortion is not healthcare. This is a 
lie from the abortion industry that 
has, time and time again, placed its 
agenda over the health and safety of 
women and girls. 
Healthcare is meant to help patients. 
Yet, a successful abortion results in 
the death of a baby 100 percent of the 
time, except, of course, for those born 
alive, which my Democrat colleagues 
don’t even want to save them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this legislation. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER), a real 
champion for women, for health, and 
for families. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, it gets 
more painful every single day. When 
you think about it, you have an AG in 
Indiana who has smeared a healthcare 
professional in that State who did ex-
actly what she was supposed to do in 
providing an abortion to a 10-year-old. 
But he was going to bring charges 
against her. 
We have a colleague on the other side 
of the aisle who is now putting down 
$20 bills as if we are going to race over 
there to get that $20 bill to answer his 
question. 
I mean, what are we doing here? Have 
we lost it? 
This bill simply codifies what is in-
terpreted in the Constitution in the 
Fifth Amendment. 
Now, we have a Justice, Kavanaugh, 
who was asked the question: May a 
State bar a resident of the State from 
traveling to another State? The answer 
is no. But, interestingly enough, the 
right to travel, those words, are not in 
the Fifth Amendment. 
So, if we have an originalist Court, 
we do have to pass this bill, which has 
been introduced by Congresswomen 
FLETCHER and STRICKLAND and other 
Members, because women should be 
able to travel. Right now, we cannot 
even guarantee that to a woman who 
wants to get an abortion. 
I have had an abortion. I have had 
miscarriages. I have had to live with a 
dead fetus in my body. I know what 
that experience is like. Not everyone 
over there does. I would say most Mem-
bers over there don’t. 
But it is my personal right. It is 
every woman’s personal right. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
JOHNSON), who is on the leadership 
team in the House and a great defender 
for life. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
leading and for all of her courageous 
leadership on this important issue. 
Madam Speaker, I have to say, we 
have been stunned here in the last hour 
of this debate by a lot of what we have 
heard, not the least of which is when 
one of our Democrat colleagues actu-
ally exclaimed on this floor in the last 
hour: ‘‘Thank God abortion is still 
legal.’’ 
I just sat here and said wow. Thank 
God? Thank God for what? That inno-
cent, unborn children can still be 
killed in many States? Thank God? 
The other side in this debate has not 
only abandoned reverence, all rev-
erence, all morality, all reason, but 
they defied medical technology. 
They have also completely aban-
doned the first self-evident truth bold-
ly proclaimed in our Nation’s birth cer-
tificate, the Declaration of Independ-
ence, that all men are created equal— 
not born equal—created equal by God, 
and it is He who gives our inalienable 
rights, beginning, obviously, with the 
right to life. 
I mean, seriously, please don’t come 
on this floor and thank our creator for

your zeal to terminate the innocent 
lives that He has created. God have 
mercy on us. 
Madam Speaker, today, the Demo-
crats have brought two bills to this 
floor. The first is a complete overhaul 
of all pro-life protections, which will 
allow for taxpayer-funded abortion on 
demand through all three trimesters of 
pregnancy. 
The second bill, the so-called Ensur-
ing Access to Abortion Act, creates an 
open door for women to be preyed upon 
by traffickers and does nothing to pro-
tect minors who are transported by 
predators across State lines to obtain 
abortions. 
In order to prohibit these heinous 
acts, I introduced the Child Interstate 
Abortion Notification Act, which, by 
the way, I should note, passed this 
House by a wide margin in 2005 in the 
109th Congress. How far the other side 
has devolved since then. Because of 
that, now more than ever, we have to 
highlight why this bill is so important 
in protecting the lives of minors and 
their unborn children. 
The Child Interstate Abortion Notifi-
cation Act will help cut down on preda-
tors and traffickers taking advantage 
of minors by making it a crime to 
knowingly transport a minor across 
State lines to obtain an abortion with-
out first satisfying State-level parental 
involvement laws. 
b 1215 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, it is simple. A parent should 
be involved in the life of their child, 
and State laws should never be cir-
cumvented to benefit those seeking to 
take advantage of minors. 
When a State says a guardian or par-
ent should be notified that their minor 
is seeking an abortion, that law ought 
to be respected and followed. Our 
States’ parental involvement laws are 
well-written and reasonable, and there 
are exceptions built into the statutes 
for extreme circumstances. 
We also know that forced coercion to 
abort an unborn child is real, and it 
must be addressed. Predators, traf-
fickers, and their accomplices must be 
held accountable for the damage they 
have done to minors. 
I am so glad that our side is offering 
tangible solutions to real problems; but 
it is unfortunate that it is in response 
to such terrible pieces of legislation 
that only further endanger the lives of 
minors and their unborn children. 
I urge opposition to the other side’s 
callous and barbaric agenda and their 
bill, and I support our motion to re-
commit. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), where 
this is top of mind. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I 
thank 
my 
good 
friends, 
LIZZIE 
FLETCHER
and MARILYN
STRICKLAND 
and JAMIE RASKIN, for understanding 
the Constitution. 
Patricia 
Hughes 
and 
Jeremy 
Donahue threw a Molotov cocktail in a 
clinic, an abortion clinic, in Shreve-
port, Louisiana. David McMenemy of 
Rochester crashed his car into the 
Edgerton Women’s Care Center. A 
package left at a woman’s health cen-
ter in Austin, Texas, contained an ex-
plosive device. It goes on and on and 
on. 
A Texas woman has been charged 
with murder after a so-called, self-in-
duced abortion. It is clear that our 
friends are trying to criminalize the 
right to reproductive freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article from NPR and a doc-
ument 
entitled 
‘‘Violence 
Against 
Abortion Providers.’’ 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ABORTION PROVIDERS, 
CLINICS, AND ACTIVISTS 
December 12, 2005: Patricia Hughes and 
Jeremy Dunahoe threw a Molotov cocktail 
at a clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana. The de-
vice missed the building and no damage was 
caused. In August 2006, Hughes was sen-
tenced to six years in prison, and Dunahoe to 
one year. Hughes claimed the bomb was a 
‘‘memorial lamp’’ for an abortion she had 
had there. 
September 11, 2006: David McMenemy of 
Rochester Hills, Michigan, crashed his car 
into the Edgerton Women’s Care Center in 
Davenport, Iowa. He then doused the lobby 
in gasoline and started a fire. McMenemy 
committed these acts in the belief that the 
center was performing abortions; however, 
Edgerton is not an abortion clinic. Time 
magazine listed the incident in a ‘‘Top 10 
Inept Terrorist Plots’’ list. 
April 25, 2007: A package left at a women’s 
health clinic in Austin, Texas, contained an 
explosive device capable of inflicting serious 
injury or death. A bomb squad detonated the 
device after evacuating the building. Paul 
Ross Evans (who had a criminal record for 
armed robbery and theft) was found guilty of 
the crime. 
May 9, 2007: An unidentified person delib-
erately set fire to a Planned Parenthood 
clinic in Virginia Beach, Virginia. 
December 6, 2007: Chad Altman and Sergio 
Baca were arrested for the arson of Curtis 
Boyd’s 
clinic 
in 
Albuquerque. 
Baca’s 
girlfriend had scheduled an appointment for 
an abortion at the clinic. 
January 22, 2009: Matthew L. Derosia, 32, 
who was reported to have had a history of 
mental illness, rammed an SUV into the 
front entrance of a Planned Parenthood clin-
ic in Saint Paul, Minnesota, causing between 
$2,500 and $5,000 in damage. Derosia, who told 
police that Jesus told him to ‘‘stop the mur-
derers,’’ was ruled competent to stand trial. 
He pleaded guilty in March 2009 to one count 
of criminal damage to property. 
August 29, 2009: Two days after a nearby 
anti-abortion protest, an unknown arsonist 
threw a molotov cocktail at a Planned Par-
enthood in Lincoln, Nebraska. The bomb fell 
short of the building, leaving no property 
damage or casualties. 
January 1, 2012: Bobby Joe Rogers, 41, 
firebombed the American Family Planning 
Clinic in Pensacola, Florida, with a Molotov 
cocktail; the fire gutted the building. Rogers 
told investigators that he was motivated to 
commit the crime by his opposition to abor-
tion, and that what more directly prompted 
the act was seeing a patient enter the clinic 
during one of the frequent antiabortion pro-
tests there. The clinic had previously been 
bombed at Christmas in 1984 and was the site 
of the murder of John Britton and James 
Barrett in 1994. 
April 1, 2012: A bomb exploded on the win-
dowsill of a Planned Parenthood clinic in 
Grand Chute, Wisconsin, resulting in a fire 
that caused minimal damage. 
April 11, 2013: Benjamin David Curell, 27, 
caused extensive damage to a Planned Par-
enthood clinic in Bloomington, Indiana, van-
dalizing it with an axe: Curell was convicted 
in state court of felony burglary, and pleaded 
guilty in federal court to one count of vio-
lating the Freedom of Access to Clinic En-
trances Act. In the federal case, he was sen-
tenced to three years of probation and or-
dered to pay restitution. 
October 3–4, 2013: 32–year-old Jebediah 
Stout attempted to set a Planned Parent-
hood clinic in Joplin, Missouri on fire two 
days in a row. Stout previously set a fire at 
a Joplin mosque. 
September 4, 2015: A Planned Parenthood 
clinic in Pullman, Washington was inten-
tionally set on fire. No injuries were re-
ported due to the time of day, but the FBI 
was involved because of a history of domes-
tic terrorism against the clinic. The crime 
was never solved. The clinic reopened six 
months later. 
October 22, 2015: A Planned Parenthood 
clinic in Claremont, New Hampshire was 
vandalized by a juvenile intruder. Damaged 
in the attack were computers, furniture, 
plumbing fixtures, office equipment, medical

February 24–25, 2016: Travis Reynolds, 21, 
vandalized a Baltimore-area women’s health 
care clinic with antiabortion graffiti. After 
being arrested, Reynolds ‘‘admitted to police 
that he defaced the clinic’s doors, walls and 
windows because he thought that it would

July 15, 2022 
December 31, 2021: On New Year’s Eve, a 
fire destroyed a Planned Parenthood in 
Knoxville, 
Tennessee. 
The 
building 
was 
closed at the time for renovations. The 
Knoxville Fire Department and Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives 
ruled the fire arson. The clinic had pre-
viously been shot at in January of the same 
year. 
May 25, 2022: A masked woman set a fire at 
a planned abortion clinic in Casper, Wyo-
ming. The ATF offered a $5,000 reward for in-
formation leading to her arrest. 
[From NPR, April 10, 2022] 
A TEXAS WOMAN HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
MURDER AFTER A SO-CALLED ‘SELF-INDUCED 
ABORTION’ 
(By Carolina Cuellar) 
A Texas woman has been charged with 
murder for a what authorities are calling a 
self-induced abortion. 
Ayesha Rascoe, Host: 
In South Texas, 26-year-old Lizelle Herrera 
is being charged with murder because of a, 
quote, ‘‘self-induced abortion.’’ She’s been 
arrested and will be arraigned Wednesday. 
The Starr County District Attorney’s Office 
has yet to comment on the case. Here’s 
Texas Public Radio’s Carolina Cuellar with 
what we know. 
Unidentified Person: (Chanting in Span-
ish). 
Unidentified People: (Chanting in Span-
ish). 
Carolina Cuellar, Byline: On Saturday, 
across the street from the Starr County Jail, 
a sparse crowd of pro-abortion rights activ-
ists chanted for Herrera’s release. 
Unidentified Person: (Chanting in Span-
ish). 
Unidentified People: (Chanting in Span-
ish). 
Cuellar: At the protest, Cathy Torres, the 
organizing manager for Frontera Fund, said 
based on what she knows about Herrera’s 
case, it isn’t likely to be unique. 
Cathy Torres: This is only setting a prece-
dent for other cases. She’s not the first. She 
won’t be the last. 
Cuellar: She said many women in Texas 
are having to choose self-administered abor-
tions because of the state’s restrictive abor-
tion legislation, like Senate Bill 8. While 
SB8 explicitly exempts pregnant women who 
get an abortion from criminal repercussions, 
it makes it nearly impossible to access abor-
tion services in Texas, and many people are 
left with little to no legal options to termi-
nate their pregnancy. 
Steve Vladeck, who is a law professor at 
the University of Texas School of Law, said 
that based on current information, the mur-
der charge doesn’t make sense. 
Steve Vladeck: The Texas murder statute 
does apply to the killing of an unborn fetus, 
but it specifically exempts cases where the 
person who terminated the fetus is the preg-
nant woman. 
Cuellar: It’s unclear whether Herrera in-
duced her own abortion or assisted someone 
else’s self-induced abortion. He said details 
like which statutes were used to charge her 
will help paint a clear picture of how pros-
ecutors avoided the exemption if Herrera 
performed her own abortion. But right now, 
this information is unavailable. Nonetheless, 
Vladeck said Herrera’s situation shows what 
will happen as legal protections around abor-
tion crumble. 
Vladeck: You know, I think what this case 
really is is an ominous portent of what 
things are going to look like on the ground 
in states that have aggressive abortion re-
strictions. 
Cuellar: Jessica Brand agrees. She’s a 
former prosecutor and founder of The Wren 
Collective, a criminal justice nonprofit orga-
nization. 
Jessica Brand: We’ve had a lot of wake-up 
calls in Texas for how far people are willing 
to go to prosecute women, to strip women of 
their rights. 
Cuellar: According to Brand, while legal 
ground for the case is shaky, it shows how 
legislation like SB8 emboldens people to 
push legal boundaries around abortion. She 
adds that as restrictions continue to grow, 
they 
will 
disproportionately 
affect 
marginalized communities, like those along 
the Texas-Mexico border. This is because 
they often lack the resources that would 
allow them to travel out of state and obtain 
safe medical abortion services. 
Brand: It’s very, very dangerous. If they 
decide that a self-induced and termination of 
pregnancy is, in fact—qualifies as murder, 
you can imagine the horrific precedent that 
sets. 
Cuellar: Shortly after the protest, a legal 
defense fund covered Herrera’s $500,000 bail. 
I’m Carolina Cuellar in Rio Grande City. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I stand, as I said earlier, with a 10- 
year-old victim who had to run to be 
able to secure an abortion after being 
raped. 
I stand on the Constitution where the 
Fifth Amendment says that we are due 
life and liberty. I stand in front of ‘‘In 
God We Trust,’’ and I tell my friend 
from Louisiana that the Constitution 
says that we have a right to freedom of 
religion. 
We speak what we believe. That is 
what this legislation does, and that is 
what reproductive freedom is. It is to 
ensure that the GOP does not crim-
inalize abortion in all 50 States. 
It is to ensure that Republicans are 
not plotting a nationwide ban to crim-
inalize. This Constitutional expose, and 
explanation, indicates that we have the 
right to travel and the right to be con-
stitutionally secure in that. 
Further, we need to go a step further 
and criminalize anyone who is a boun-
ty hunter and hold them accountable 
and put them in jail. 
Specifically, this bill provides and 
makes sure that we prohibit any per-
son or healthcare providers who pro-
vide legal abortion or services, that we 
don’t stop that, that we don’t stop any 
person 
or 
any 
entity 
for 
helping 
healthcare providers. Let me thank 
you and ask support of this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Ac-
cess to Abortion Act of 2022. 
H.R. 8297, the ‘‘Ensuring Access to Abor-
tion Act of 2022’’ will protect women and girls 
from others preventing or interfering with a 
person’s ability to access abortion care across 
state lines. 
H.R. 8297 prohibits anyone acting under 
state law from interfering with a person’s abil-
ity to access abortifacient drugs, abortion 
counseling, or abortion services out-of-state. 
When I cosponsored this bill, I was specifi-
cally thinking of the women in my hometown 
of Houston, who now must travel 12 hours to 
reach the nearest abortion clinic in New Mex-
ico. 
I fear that Texas women and girls will be-
cause of the state’s antiabortion laws will be 
living behind a new ‘‘Iron Curtain.’’ 
The harrowing stories of people escaping 
across the Berlin Wall to freedom will be re-
placed by women escaping Texas to save 
their own or a loved one’s life. 
I am concerned that there will be a new Un-
derground Railroad with conductors ferrying 
women to New Mexico where they well have 
the freedom to make their own medical deci-
sions. 
It is the landmass of the state of Texas that 
makes this bill desperately needed. 
Texas is the second-largest state in the US 
with an area of 268,597 square miles or 
171,902,080 acres which is more than 7.4 per-
cent of the United States total land mass. 
In comparison, Texas is about 1.65 times 
larger than California, at 163,696 square 
miles. 
Texas is not the largest state, however. 
Alaska, the largest state in the US is nearly 
2.5 times larger than Texas at 663,300 square 
miles. 
Texas has 29 million residents and the 13th 
highest GDP in the world at 1.78 trillion as of 
2019. 
If Texas were its own country, it would be 
the 40th largest out of 193 countries in the 
world, bigger than every country in Europe. 
It is the quantitative, logistical, and legal 
challenge of driving to gain abortion services. 
To the South is the country of Mexico with 
passport requirements which costs hundreds 
and often many weeks to obtain. 
Those women living in regions of the state 
that border other states with prohibitions on 
reproduction options for women will make trav-
el to New Mexico the only option. 
To give some perspective on the size of 
Texas. 
Austin is closer to New Orleans than it is to 
El Paso. 
San Diego is closer to El Paso than it is to 
Houston. 
The distance from Washington, D.C. to New 
York City is about 228 miles, or four hours 
driving. 
The distance from Dallas to Houston, which 
is roughly 230 miles, or a little over four hours 
in a car. 
To the north and northeast are Louisiana, 
Arkansas, and Oklahoma all of which have 
and made add to the hurdles of reaching a 
service provider by car. 
It takes around 13 hours to drive the 805 
miles from the northernmost point to southern-
most Texas. You would start in Texhoma, a 
small town that sits on the border of Texas 
and Oklahoma then drive south through Lub-
bock, San Antonio, and all the way down to 
Brownsville, the southernmost city on the tip of 
Texas. 
It takes 11 hours to drive 773 miles from 
easternmost to westernmost points across 
Texas. 
Any drive of just a few hours may place 
women in the jurisdiction of unincorporated 
areas, rural towns, and counties where ag-
gressive enforcement of a state law may be a 
priority. 
Republican Texas lawmakers have already 
passed SB 8, one of the most barbaric and ar-
chaic anti-abortion laws in the country, that 
denies women the right to bodily autonomy 
after carrying a fetus for more than 6 weeks. 
If left to their own devices, those lawmakers 
hope to prevent Texan women from seeking 
abortions not only in Texas, but elsewhere as 
well. 
That is why I wholeheartedly support H.R. 
8297, the ‘‘Ensure Access to Abortion Act of 
2022.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6658 
July 15, 2022 
This bill would prohibit any person acting 
under state law from preventing, restricting, 
impeding, or retaliating against: 
health care providers who provide legal 
abortion services to out-of-state residents; 
any person or entity who helps health care 
providers provide such services; 
any person who travels to another state to 
obtain such services; 
any person or entity who helps another per-
son travel to another state to obtain such serv-
ices; or 
the movement in interstate commerce of 
drugs that are approved to terminate preg-
nancies. 
Women in Texas and in other states with 
anti-abortion laws are already in crisis. They 
are already forced to flee their communities, 
incur undue financial costs, and combat social 
stigma to seek abortion care beyond their 
state boundaries. 
We cannot allow these women to then be 
additionally prosecuted for exercising their 
right to abortion care in states where that right 
is still upheld. 
The ‘‘Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 
2022’’ would protect women in need of abor-
tions from litigation. 
But it goes admirably beyond that by pro-
tecting those who support women in exer-
cising their reproductive rights. 
Many organizations and community net-
works have rallied around women since the 
Supreme Courts Dobbs decision. 
Churches, non-profits, and private compa-
nies have all stepped up to the plate to sup-
port women carrying unwanted pregnancies 
whether it be through financial contributions, 
transportation assistance, housing options, or 
access to abortion drugs. 
The ‘‘Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 
2022’’ would shield them from those who wish 
to make personal gains off the private medical 
decisions of women. 
Just last week, a 10-year-old rape victim 
from Ohio was denied an abortion in her home 
state because she was six weeks and three 
days pregnant. 
I will say it again: A 10-year-old girl. Six 
weeks and three days pregnant. 
The anti-abortion trigger laws in her state 
forced this little girl to travel 175 miles to Indi-
anapolis in order to have her rapists’ fetus re-
moved from her young body. 
This little girl had to leave the comfort of her 
community, leave her state, and drive for 
hours in order to get the necessary medical 
care she undeniably needed. 
Many of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle would have preferred it if she could 
not have done even this. 
Many conservative lawmakers would have 
preferred to see lawsuits filed against the fam-
ily member who made her abortion appoint-
ment, the nurse who greeted her at the clinic, 
the parent who drove her home. 
Maybe they would have even preferred to 
see lawsuits against the owner of the gas sta-
tion where the family refueled their car, or the 
search engine that helped them locate the 
abortion clinic that saved their child from be-
coming a 10-year-old mother. 
Imagine if lawmakers had decided that this 
little girl had to see a physician 24 hours in 
advance of her appointment. Imagine if they 
had mandated that she see an ultrasound of 
her fetus. Imagine if they had required the 
physician who cared for her to counsel this 
child on the benefits of adoption. 
That is the reality many Republican law-
makers would like to see. 
That is why these two bills are so important. 
I stand in proud support of both H.R. 8296, 
the ‘‘Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022,’’ 
and H.R. 8297, the ‘‘Ensuring Access to Abor-
tion Act of 2022.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for women 
and girls and the providers who meet their 
medical needs every day. 
We cannot let those who wish to relegate 
women to second-class citizens turn back the 
clock any further. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. The 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
SCHRIER) has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. WILSON). 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. This is just annoying to me 
that everyone on the Republican side is 
so concerned about the children before 
they are born, and once they are born, 
they want nothing to do with them. 
So these children land in the hands of 
grandmama who is trying to raise 
them alone. The only time I see them 
is when they are on the floor fussing 
about grandmama’s Social Security 
and her Medicare, trying to take away 
her food stamps while she is trying to 
take care of Nina’s children, Jose’s 
children, and all of these children. 
Shame on you. You have never carried 
a baby for 9 months. Shame, shame, 
shame. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, in the United States 
of America, we continue our search for 
a more perfect Union. We all get to be 
a part of that. 
In our history, the Supreme Court 
has overruled 300 of its own cases, cases 
such as the Dred Scott decision, and 
now, Roe v. Wade. 
Abortion is a false choice between 
taking care of a woman and taking 
care of a baby. What a woman needs is 
support. 
Every life is meaningful, and our ac-
tions significant. Ending abortion is 
the human rights issue of our genera-
tion. Every life has value and dignity. 
And to every person all across this 
country, may each one of us open our 
eyes and see one another. May each one 
of us open our ears and hear one an-
other. May each one of us open our 
hearts to one another. 
We are a Nation founded on the in-
alienable, God-given rights to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. As 
has been noted by others, life comes 
first. You can’t have liberty without 
life. You can’t have the pursuit of hap-
piness without life. 
That should guide us and be the bed-
rock for our moral authority so that 
abortion would become unthinkable in 
America. 
Today before this House is a radical 
agenda. The Democrats’ abortion agen-
da is much more radical than anything 
that was in Roe. This is extreme. 
It nationalizes abortion for all 9 
months, making America just as rad-
ical as China, North Korea. It legiti-
mizes discriminatory abortions at any 
stage based upon baby’s sex, race, or 
disability, including Down syndrome. 
It overrides State laws that protect 
women from coercion. 
There is no part of this that cele-
brates the dignity, the value, or the po-
tential of human life. Pew Research re-
ports that in Washington, D.C., in the 
29 States that provide racial and ethnic 
data on abortion to the CDC, 38 percent 
of women who underwent an abortion 
in 2019 were non-Hispanic or Black, 
though U.S. Census numbers indicate 
that Black people comprise 13.4 percent 
of the population. 
CDC data from 2019 also indicates 
that Black women are five times more 
likely to have an abortion than White 
women. 
Madam Speaker, we stand on the side 
of life. Let’s defend life. It is the 
human rights issue of our generation. 
Reject this bill. I yield back the bal-
ance of the time. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, once 
again, I speak as a woman, a mom, a 
doctor, and a pediatrician who has res-
cued many babies in the neonatal in-
tensive care unit. 
I tell you that we have heard a lot of 
statistics on the other side of the aisle, 
but one statistic that has not been said 
is that 100 percent of women who 
choose abortion make that decision on 
their own and for themselves, and that 
is the way that it needs to stay. 
This is a healthcare decision that 
only a woman can make in consulta-
tion with her doctor. That is why we 
are here today, to protect women’s au-
tonomy over their own healthcare, 
over their own lives, over their own 
destinies, and that is a fundamental 
right. 
When we talk about freedom, we 
want to talk and we need to talk about 
the freedom of a woman to control her 
destiny, to make her own decisions; 
and that is why these bills are so im-
portant, to protect a woman’s right to 
choose and to make sure that if her 
State does not allow it, she can choose, 
freely, to travel to another State and 
get the care she needs. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1224, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

Add at the end of the bill the following: 
SEC. 3. TRANSPORTATION OF MINORS IN CIR-
CUMVENTION OF CERTAIN LAWS RE-
LATING TO ABORTION. 
Title 18, United States Code, is amended by 
inserting after chapter 117 the following: 
‘‘CHAPTER 
117A—TRANSPORTATION 
OF 
MINORS IN CIRCUMVENTION OF CER-
TAIN LAWS RELATING TO ABORTION 
‘‘Sec.

cumvention of certain laws re-
lating to abortion. 
‘‘2432. Transportation of minors in cir-
cumvention of certain laws re-
lating to abortion. 
‘‘§ 2431. Transportation of minors in cir-
cumvention of certain laws relating to 
abortion 
‘‘(a) OFFENSE.— 
‘‘(1) GENERALLY.—Except as provided in 
subsection (b), whoever knowingly trans-
ports a minor across a State line, with the 
intent that such minor obtain an abortion, 
and thereby in fact abridges the right of a 
parent under a law requiring parental in-
volvement in a minor’s abortion decision, in 
force in the State where the minor resides, 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned 
not more than one year, or both. 
‘‘(2) DEFINITION.—For the purposes of this 
subsection, an abridgement of the right of a 
parent occurs if an abortion is performed or 
induced on the minor, in a State or a foreign 
nation other than the State where the minor 
resides, without the parental consent or no-
tification, or the judicial authorization, that 
would have been required by that law had 
the abortion been performed in the State 
where the minor resides. 
‘‘(b) EXCEPTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) The prohibition of subsection (a) does 
not apply if the abortion was necessary to 
save the life of the minor because her life 
was endangered by a physical disorder, phys-
ical injury, or physical illness, including a 
life endangering physical condition caused 
by or arising from the pregnancy itself. 
‘‘(2) A minor transported in violation of 
this section, and any parent of that minor, 
may not be prosecuted or sued for a violation 
of this section, a conspiracy to violate this 
section, or an offense under section 2 or 3 of 
this title based on a violation of this section. 
‘‘(c) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—It is an af-
firmative defense to a prosecution for an of-
fense, or to a civil action, based on a viola-
tion of this section that the defendant— 
‘‘(1) reasonably believed, based on informa-
tion the defendant obtained directly from a 
parent of the minor, that before the minor 
obtained the abortion, the parental consent 
or notification took place that would have 
been required by the law requiring parental 
involvement in a minor’s abortion decision, 
had the abortion been performed in the State 
where the minor resides; or 
‘‘(2) was presented with documentation 
showing with a reasonable degree of cer-
tainty that a court in the minor’s State of 
residence waived any parental notification 
required by the laws of that State, or other-
wise authorized that the minor be allowed to 
procure an abortion. 
‘‘(d) CIVIL ACTION.—Any parent who suffers 
harm from a violation of subsection (a) may 
obtain appropriate relief in a civil action un-
less the parent has committed an act of in-
cest with the minor subject to subsection (a).

nate the pregnancy of a woman known to be 
pregnant, with an intention other than to in-
crease the probability of a live birth or of 
preserving the life or health of the child 
after live birth, or to remove a dead unborn 
child;

‘‘(A) a parent or guardian; 
‘‘(B) a legal custodian; or 
‘‘(C) a person standing in loco parentis who

‘‘Sec. 
‘‘2435. Child interstate abortion notification. 
‘‘§ 2435. Child interstate abortion notification 
‘‘(a) OFFENSE.— 
‘‘(1) GENERALLY.—A physician who know-
ingly performs or induces an abortion on a 
minor in violation of the requirements of 
this section shall be fined under this title or 
imprisoned not more than one year, or both. 
‘‘(2) PARENTAL NOTIFICATION.—A physician 
who performs or induces an abortion on a 
minor who is a resident of a State other than 
the State in which the abortion is performed 
must provide, or cause his or her agent to 
provide, at least 24 hours actual notice to a 
parent of the minor before performing the 
abortion. If actual notice to such parent is 
not accomplished after a reasonable effort 
has been made, at least 24 hours constructive 
notice must be given to a parent before the 
abortion is performed. 
‘‘(b) 
EXCEPTIONS.—The 
notification 
re-
quirement of subsection (a)(2) does not apply 
if— 
‘‘(1) the abortion is performed or induced 
in a State that has, in force, a law requiring 
parental involvement in a minor’s abortion 
decision and the physician complies with the 
requirements of that law; 
‘‘(2) the physician is presented with docu-
mentation showing with a reasonable degree 
of certainty that a court in the minor’s 
State of residence has waived any parental 
notification required by the laws of that 
State, or has otherwise authorized that the 
minor be allowed to procure an abortion; 
‘‘(3) the minor declares in a signed written 
statement that she is the victim of sexual 
abuse, neglect, or physical abuse by a parent, 
and, before an abortion is performed on the 
minor, the physician notifies the authorities 
specified to receive reports of child abuse or 
neglect by the law of the State in which the 
minor resides of the known or suspected 
abuse or neglect; 
‘‘(4) the abortion is necessary to save the 
life of the minor because her life was endan-
gered by a physical disorder, physical injury, 
or physical illness, including a life endan-
gering physical condition caused by or aris-
ing from the pregnancy itself, but an excep-
tion under this paragraph does not apply un-
less the attending physician or an agent of 
such physician, within 24 hours after comple-
tion of the abortion, notifies a parent in 
writing that an abortion was performed on 
the minor and of the circumstances that 
warranted invocation of this paragraph; or 
‘‘(5) the minor is physically accompanied 
by a person who presents the physician or his 
agent with documentation showing with a 
reasonable degree of certainty that he or she 
is in fact the parent of that minor. 
‘‘(c) CIVIL ACTION.—Any parent who suffers 
harm from a violation of subsection (a) may 
obtain appropriate relief in a civil action un-
less the parent has committed an act of in-
cest with the minor subject to subsection (a). 
‘‘(d) DEFINITIONS.—For the purposes of this 
section— 
‘‘(1) the term ‘abortion’ means the use or 
prescription of any instrument, medicine, 
drug, or any other substance or device— 
‘‘(A) to intentionally kill the unborn child 
of a woman known to be pregnant; or 
‘‘(B) to intentionally prematurely termi-
nate the pregnancy of a woman known to be 
pregnant, with an intention other than to in-
crease the probability of a live birth or of 
preserving the life or health of the child 
after live birth, or to remove a dead unborn 
child; 
‘‘(2) the term ‘actual notice’ means the giv-
ing of written notice directly, in person, by 
the physician or any agent of the physician; 
‘‘(3) the term ‘constructive notice’ means 
notice that is given by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, restricted delivery to the 
last known address of the person being noti-
fied, with delivery deemed to have occurred 
48 hours following noon on the next day sub-
sequent to mailing on which regular mail de-
livery takes place, days on which mail is not 
delivered excluded; 
‘‘(4) the term ‘law requiring parental in-
volvement in a minor’s abortion decision’ 
means a law— 
‘‘(A) requiring, before an abortion is per-
formed on a minor, either— 
‘‘(i) the notification to, or consent of, a 
parent of that minor; or 
‘‘(ii) proceedings in a State court; and 
‘‘(B) that does not provide as an alter-
native to the requirements described in sub-
paragraph (A) notification to or consent of

COMMUNICATION FROM THE HON-
ORABLE JODY HICE, MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Honorable JODY 
HICE, Member of Congress: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 14, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I am writing today 
in compliance with Rule VIII, Paragraph 2(a) 
of the Rules of the House of Representatives. 
Upholding my responsibilities as a member 
of this legislative body, I am communicating 
to you that I have been requested to testify 
before the Fulton County, Georgia special 
purpose grand jury on July 19, 2022. Addition-
ally, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(l), I will be 
asking for removal to the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Northern District of Geor-
gia. 
Nothing in this notice should be ‘‘con-
strued to deprive, condition, or waive the 
constitutional or legal privileges or rights 
applicable or available at any time to a 
Member[.]’’ (See Paragraph 4 of Rule VIII of 
the Rules of the House of Representatives.) 
Any additional questions you have can be 
submitted to my attorneys, Chris Gober 
(cg@gobergroup.com or 512–354–1783), Loree 
Anne Paradise (lap@gobergroup.com or 912– 
245–0212), or Josh Howard (jhoward@ghz-

Sincerely, 
JODY HICE, 
Member of Congress.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring to the 
House majority whip the schedule for 
next week. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLY-
BURN), the majority whip of the House. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
On Monday, the House will meet at 12 
p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for 
legislative business, with votes post-
poned until 6:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning 
hour and 12 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for legislative business. 
Next week, the House will begin our 
work to advance appropriations bills to 
fund the government for fiscal year 
2023 and consider H.R. 8294, a minibus 
package of Transportation and Housing 
and Urban Development; Agriculture 
and Rural Development; Energy and 
Water Development; Financial Services 
and General Government; Interior and 
Environment; and Military Construc-
tion and Veterans Affairs. 
The House will also consider Rep-
resentative KATHY MANNING’s H.R. 8373, 
the Right to Contraception Act, which 
will protect in Federal statute the 
rights enshrined in Griswold v. Con-
necticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird. 
American women deserve to be able 
to make decisions about their own bod-
ies and their own lives, including 
whether to become pregnant and have 
children. 
The House will consider bills under 
suspension of the rules. A complete list 
of suspension bills will be announced 
by the close of business today. 
Additional legislative matters are 
possible. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
know this is a conversation I have had 
for months with the majority leader as 
we have talked about the concern over 
high gas prices, and I notice that, on 
the agenda that was listed, there are 
no bills that would deal with the high 
price of gasoline that families are 
struggling under due to President 
Biden’s many different actions he has 
taken to shut down American energy. 
Of course, as we know, the President 
today is in Saudi Arabia, begging the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to produce 
more oil, when we have been asking the 
President to work with us to open up 
American energy, which is abundant, 
available, but, unfortunately, closed 
for business. 
Of course, we know during the cam-
paign, President Biden bragged that he 
was going to shut down drilling, that 
he was going to make it hard for the 
energy companies to produce in Amer-
ica, and he has done that. The problem 
is it has had devastating impacts on 
families. 
So, we brought forward a number of 
bills, again, months ago. I have pre-
sented some of these to the majority 
leader. He said he would look at them 
and consider bringing some of them up. 
I want to present a few of these to the 
gentleman from South Carolina to see 
if we can get consideration of some of 
these bills next week at a time when 
we just saw a report with 9.1 percent 
inflation, the worst numbers in 40 
years, in large part driven by the high 
price of gasoline. 
b 1400 
We have bills to alleviate that prob-
lem that families are facing. 
I will start with H.R. 7285, by Mr. 
CARL. This is the Unleashing American 
Energy Act that requires the Secretary 
of the Interior to conduct a minimum 
number of oil and gas lease sales so 
that we can get back to producing 
more energy here. 
H.R. 7292, by GARRET GRAVES, the Se-
curing American Energy and Investing 
in Resiliency Act: This requires the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct all 
oil and gas lease sales that, under cur-
rent law, he is supposed to be doing. 
The President is not in compliance 
with existing law on that. 
H.R. 7293, the Energy Permitting Cer-
tainty Act, by Ms. HERRELL: This re-
quires the Secretary of the Interior to 
process applications for a permit to 
drill. It doesn’t tell the Secretary what 
determination they have to give, but it 
gives them a shot clock, just like they 
give to businesses. When they tell a 
business that they have to give an an-
swer on something, it is by a certain 
date. Yet, when the applications are 
submitted, the agency just ignores it, 
just doesn’t do their job. Let’s get an

July 15, 2022 
answer, yes or no. Let’s get an answer 
and back it up with facts. That is what 
this bill requires. 
H.R. 7298, the Promoting Energy 
Independence and Transparency Act, 
by Mr. MOORE from Utah: This requires 
the Secretary of the Interior to submit 
a report on expressions of interest in 
applications of permits to drill and re-
quires the publication of data on ex-
pressions of interest in applications of 
permits to drill. 
H.R. 7304, the Restore Onshore En-
ergy 
Production 
Act, 
by 
Mr. 
ROSENDALE: This requires the Sec-
retary of the Interior to immediately 
resume onshore oil and gas lease sales. 
Let us have an opportunity to utilize 
our natural resources to lower the 
price of gas. 
H.R. 751, the Protecting American 
Energy Production Act, by Mr. DUN-
CAN: This prohibits any declaration of a 
moratorium on the use of hydraulic 
fracturing, which, again, has been a 
threat by this administration on a very 
efficient, clean source of energy that 
America could produce but, right now, 
is being dramatically limited. 
Finally, H.R. 1616, the Promoting 
Interagency Coordination for Review of 
Natural Gas Pipelines Act, by Mr. BUR-
GESS: This provides for Federal and 
State agency coordination in the ap-
proval of certain authorizations under 
the Natural Gas Act for the critical in-
frastructure of pipelines to move en-
ergy throughout America so we don’t 
have to get it from tankers, from for-
eign countries, many of them hostile to 
America. 
I would be happy to yield to see if we 
could get some consideration next 
week of some of those bills, if not all. 
Mr. CLYBURN. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. I assure you that 
we will get to discuss and debate and 
hopefully pass all of these bills at the 
appropriate time. 
However, I am sure the gentleman is 
aware 
that 
Russia’s 
war 
against 
Ukraine is driving up prices all over 
the world—Putin’s price hike. 
Three weeks ago, the price of crude 
oil was trading at $115.25 per barrel. It 
closed yesterday at $96.47 a barrel, a 
decrease of $18.78 per barrel, or a de-
crease of 16 percent in almost a month. 
The average price for gasoline, a gal-
lon of gas, last month was $5.01. It is 
now $4.57. It decreased 44 cents, or a de-
crease of 8 percent, in a month. Funny 
how that works. 
Cuts at the pump are half that of the 
price of crude, and we are shocked to 
know that major oil companies are 
raking in record profits. 
The House passed the Lower Food 
and Fuel Costs Act, which will help 
ease inflation, which the gentleman 
voted against and quipped against. 
This bill helps Americans save money 
at the gas pump by promoting local, re-
newable energy production, and it also 
expands access to E15. 
The House also passed the Consumer 
Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to 
prevent 
all 
corporations 
from 
prioritizing profits instead of increas-
ing supply. It empowers the FTC to 
crack down on oil companies that ex-
cessively overcharge their consumers 
for gas just to boost their bottom line. 
The President has released historic 
amounts from our Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, a million gallons a day, and 
expanded access to cheaper E15 gas 
across the Midwest, among other steps 
to bring down energy prices. 
The Biden administration has ap-
proved more drilling permits on public 
lands in 2021 than the previous admin-
istration did each year during the first 
3 years in office, 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
The Biden administration is also 
working with our allies and partners 
around the world to implement a price 
cap on Russian oil so that we can con-
tinue to inflict pain on Putin while 
minimizing the pain at the pump. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, if the 
gentleman is interested in inflicting 
pain on Putin, then pass these bills. 
These bills will take away all of 
Putin’s 
leverage. 
The 
only 
reason 
Vladimir Putin has any leverage over 
America and Europe is because Presi-
dent Biden shut down American en-
ergy. 
Again, each of these bills addresses 
different 
components 
of 
President 
Biden’s attack on American energy. It 
has been a very direct assault on Amer-
ican energy on many different fronts. 
These lay out all of those things. 
You can have all the leases in the 
world, but if the administration won’t 
give permits to actually execute the 
lease to do seismic, to build pipelines 
so you can actually move the resource, 
to drill in new areas while the resource 
is being depleted in other areas, then 
you don’t have an ability to secure 
America’s future. It results in the 
President going hat in hand to foreign 
countries like Saudi Arabia. 
I would just point out that I know 
the President likes talking about car-
bon emissions a lot. It is a 5,700-mile 
trek to Saudi Arabia, and I would 
imagine he is going to come back 
home. That is more than 11,000 miles 
on Air Force One. If you notice the pic-
ture, there are no solar panels on the 
wings of Air Force One. It is jet fuel 
that actually gets it from here to there 
and back with the President and his 
staff. You could save all 11,000 miles 
and the entire carbon footprint of that 
trip by staying here in America. I rec-
ommend going to a place like Port 
Fourchon in south Louisiana where 
they produce energy cleaner, cheaper, 
and with American jobs. 
By the way, as States drill, they get 
revenue sharing. They would actually 
be able to use that investment to lower 
prices at the pump and to help Amer-
ican families. 
If you think about where the price is 
today, whether it is $5.20 or $4.80—of 
course, it continues to go back and 
forth in a very high range—it is all 
double, more than double, what it was 
2 years ago. 
What that means is that people who 
are filling up are looking at the bottom 
line. They are looking at the fact that 
it is costing them over $150 to fill their 
car today when it cost them maybe $70 
2 years ago if they can afford to fill it 
up all the way. 
We are seeing a trend right now 
where many families can’t even get it 
to full. They might have to go only 
halfway because they can’t afford the 
full price. Their credit cards get maxed 
out before then because if they are fill-
ing up to go to the grocery store, they 
are also paying double-digit increases 
for everything they are buying there 
because of the spending-induced infla-
tion. 
I suggest if we want to send a mes-
sage to Putin, no better way to do it 
than to cut him off at the knees in his 
ability to hold leverage over America 
and Europe by producing more here in 
America. 
If we produce it in America, cartels 
can’t control the price. Putin can’t 
control the price. We can meet all of 
our needs and help our allies around 
the world so that Putin has no leverage 
over anybody. 
The only person giving Putin lever-
age today is President Biden by allow-
ing all these limitations on American 
energy production that these bills will 
remove. These bills will help America 
get back to energy independence by 
unleashing 
all 
of 
those 
different 
leverages, those different inhibitions, 
the prohibitions that President Biden 
has put on our energy. 
Again, if he was against all fossil 
fuels, maybe there would be a consist-
ency in policy, but he is only against 
American fossil fuels. He will travel 
5,700 miles to beg Saudi to produce oil 
that he won’t allow our own producers 
here in America to produce. I think 
that is what has Americans irate the 
most. 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I think the gentleman is well aware 
that the President has certain authori-
ties that he can use, and he is using 
them. The oil companies have certain 
responsibilities, and the question is 
whether or not they are living up to 
their responsibilities. 
I know the gentleman is as aware as 
I am of all the permits out there that 
are not being utilized. Of course, we are 
at the mercy of those corporate deci-
sions. Hopefully, they will be made in 
due course and in such a way that 
would bring relief to the American peo-
ple. 
I suspect the consideration of all 
those bills that you are discussing will 
be taken up by the leader at the time 
that he considers to be appropriate. I, 
along with the gentleman, will con-
tinue to consult, and hopefully, we can 
address all these issues in the very— 
let’s just say shortly. 
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate that. 
Hopefully, as I continue to have these 
conversations with the leader, maybe 
you and I could be whipping these bills 
together. You would see an over-
whelming result and a quick reduction

in the price at the pump that is hurt-
ing families. 
One final question I want to raise to 
the gentleman, and this came up yes-
terday or 2 days ago as we were having 
a series of votes on the National De-
fense Authorization Act, as the gen-
tleman pointed out. Next week, we will 
be bringing up some of the appropria-
tions bills, with still more to come 
over the next few weeks. As we have 
large 
numbers 
of 
amendments 
on 
NDAA and appropriations, which is 
typical for the process, to be able to go 
back to 2-minute voting where we can 
do our business not in 4 hours until 11 
at night, but where we can actually be 
more efficient at processing all the re-
quests that Members have to get a vote 
on different issues. 
We have continued to push to end 
proxy voting. Again, you have seen 
most of the country already get there. 
Most of the country is getting back to 
work. 
Airplanes, finally, you don’t have to 
wear masks anymore. People are trav-
eling internationally again. People are 
opening up their offices again to get 
workers in the office. 
Congress, frankly, should be leading, 
not lagging, on this. But if we got rid 
of proxy voting, we could get back next 
week to 2-minute votes and be much 
more effective and efficient in doing 
our jobs here in Congress. 
Is that something that the majority 
would consider, especially looking at 
six different appropriations bills, which 
I am sure will yield hundreds of amend-
ments that would be debated and voted 
on, on this floor? 
I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you for yield-
ing. 
As the gentleman knows, proxy vot-
ing has been utilized by both sides of 
the aisle. I admit it can be a very cum-
bersome process here on the floor, but 
we all utilize it. It is done because it 
serves a very valuable purpose for this 
institution. 
We have made great strides in miti-
gating the harm of the coronavirus 
pandemic through vaccines and treat-
ments, but as we both know, the dis-
ease continues to spread in both of our 
home States. 
We are hearing numbers that are 
very concerning. In just this week of 
this session alone, I know of several 
Members who have tested positive for 
COVID and are, therefore, isolating. 
These Members can still participate 
in the process and represent their con-
stituents by using the proxy vote. Of 
course, having the proxy vote and hav-
ing 2-minute votes doesn’t seem a pret-
ty efficient process to me. We are hav-
ing a hard time getting it done during 
5 minutes. 
We just had several 5-minute votes, 
and I saw on my friend’s side of the 
aisle about 15 people still lined up after 
the time has expired. 
Both of us are being disadvantaged 
and inconvenienced by this process, but 
I think it is something that we have to 
do. I don’t know how we could be effi-
cient in this operation with 2-minute 
voting. 
I will pass that along to the leader 
and hope that he will keep in mind 
that coronavirus is still here with us, 
as the gentleman knows. 
We serve together on the coronavirus 
select subcommittee, and we are con-
fronted with issues that still concern 
the American people. I think that we 
have to keep all of that in mind as we 
try to carry out the people’s business. 
b 1415 
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate that. I 
will share—and if the gentleman want-
ed to share as well with the majority 
leader—our 
side 
stands 
ready 
and 
strongly 
encourages 
the 
complete 
elimination of proxy voting. We could 
absolutely get back to 2-minute voting 
with that. It is not a partisan issue. 
You can look across the Capitol, in 
the United States Senate they have 
never utilized proxy voting. They con-
tinue to do their work. It is, of course, 
controlled by Democrats over there. 
They represent the same States that 
we represent. They managed to do 
their business without proxy voting so 
that everybody has to show up to do 
their job. 
This time is no different than any 
other time in our Nation’s history. 
There are some people who get ill; 
there are some people who have sur-
geries; there are some people who just 
have other things maybe with their 
family that takes them away. That is 
something that we all accommodate, 
we all recognize as a condition of doing 
a job that actually requires interaction 
with other people. The Senate has 
managed to do it without proxy voting; 
we would just urge that the House em-
brace that same approach. We will con-
tinue to push for that, which would 
allow us to do things like 2-minute vot-
ing. 
Unless the gentleman has anything 
else, I am prepared to yield back. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
VINCENT RANGEL 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in celebration of 
the life of a friend and an outstanding 
Chicagoan, Vincent ‘‘Vince’’ Rangel. 
Vince was an immigrant from Mexico 
who proudly chose to serve his country 
during the Vietnam war as a member 
of the U.S. Army, accumulating a long 
list of decorations, including a Purple 
Heart, a Bronze Star Medal, the Viet-
nam Service Medal, and many more. 
Vince later served in numerous vet-
erans’ organizations in Illinois, becom-
ing a leading advocate for enhanced be-
havioral health services for veterans. 
His service to our community in-
cluded his work in support of small 
business as president of the Mexican- 
American Chamber of Commerce of Il-
linois and as board member of the U.S.- 
Hispanic Chamber. 
Vince never forgot his roots, serving 
as president of the Mexican Civic Soci-
ety of Illinois, helping to promote 
Mexican history and culture. 
My wife, Evelyn, and I send his 
daughters, Veronica and Jennifer, and 
his beloved grandchildren, Juan Diego 
and Victoria, our most sincere condo-
lences. 
f 
CONGRATULATING KIRKLEY 
THOMAS ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
wish a happy retirement to Kirkley 
Thomas, the vice president of govern-
ment affairs for Arkansas Electric Co-
operatives, Inc. 
Early in his career, Kirkley served as 
a professional staff member in the 
United States Senate and subsequently 
worked for the Arkansas Economic De-
velopment Commission. Mr. Thomas 
accepted his leadership post at Arkan-
sas Electric Cooperatives and served 
for 81⁄2 years. 
His service to our State and his con-
tributions to the important progress in 
building badly needed infrastructure 
for power and broadband services is 
deeply appreciated. Our families have 
benefited by his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Kirkley 
Thomas for his years of service, and I 
wish him a very happy retirement. 
f 
FIGHTING FOR REPRODUCTIVE 
RIGHTS 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
recently the Supreme Court took an 
unprecedented, deeply disappointing, 
and ideologically driven action to over-
turn Roe v. Wade. 
This is a targeted attack on Ameri-
cans’ rights to make decisions for their 
bodies, their lives, and their future. 
This decision sets a very dangerous 
precedent for our Nation’s highest 
court and is the result of a premedi-
tated agenda from radical conserv-
atives to dismantle access to com-
prehensive reproductive care. 
The decision to have an abortion is a 
deeply personal one, one that should be 
made between a patient and their doc-
tor, not by politically motivated judges 
or politicians. 
Roe offered Americans protections 
from the unsolicited belief systems and 
the ideologies of others being imposed 
on them and their personal healthcare 
decisions. 
I am committed to continuing to 
work alongside House Democrats and 
President Biden in the fight for repro-
ductive freedom and reproductive jus-
tice and the right to abortion across 
the United States.

July 15, 2022 
WAR IN UKRAINE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to address the current situa-
tion in Ukraine. 
Obviously, 
everyday 
people 
in 
Ukraine and Russia are dying, and I am 
concerned that the current administra-
tion has no particular plan, or at least 
we are not told of any plan or goal, as 
to where we want to wind up. 
Ukraine has the second lowest birth-
rate of any country in a country of 
that size in the world. It is lower than 
all but South Korea. Russia also has a 
very low birthrate. Even before the 
war, a lot of Russians were leaving 
Russia, at least subjectively from what 
I have seen when I toured the southern 
border of the United States. 
The combination of immigration and 
low birthrate means that the primary 
goal of the leaders of both these coun-
tries should be to make sure we get the 
number of Russians and Ukrainians up, 
not going the opposite direction. 
In any event, I do not know. We have 
not met collectively since March to 
have a briefing for all the legislators as 
to what the opinions of the Biden ad-
ministration are. So I am going to ask 
the press maybe to ask a few questions 
to find out whether they are working 
with anybody to try to reach some sort 
of end to this war or if they don’t care 
if it goes on for another 6 months. 
f 
PURSUING COMMON GROUND 
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I am 
hearing from Minnesotans who want 
their leaders to reach across the aisle 
and pursue common ground. 
From fighting inflation to fighting 
crime, I work to build consensus on our 
biggest challenges as vice chair of the 
bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, 
and I am proud of everything that we 
have accomplished so far. 
There is hard work ahead, but Min-
nesotans know that we are stronger 
when everyone is at the table, and that 
is why I created Common Ground 
Workshops and why I will continue to 
pursue commonsense solutions. 
f 
PREVENTING CHILD SEXUAL 
ABUSE 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my support for re-
search activities to prevent child sex-
ual abuse under the CDC’s National 
Center for Injury Prevention and Con-
trol. 
Throughout my career, it has been a 
top priority of mine to protect the 
most vulnerable populations in our 
communities, including children im-
pacted from sexual abuse. 
For the second year in a row, I was 
proud to lead a letter to the House Ap-
propriations Committee in support of 
these research activities. Thank you to 
all 30 Members who joined me in this 
initiative as well as the leaders of the 
Appropriations Committee for the in-
crease in funding. 
I appreciate the report language that 
recognizes the severe and often lifelong 
physical, cognitive, and emotional im-
pact of child sexual abuse and the 
value of this research to increase the 
understanding of risk and factors that 
can improve prevention efforts. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
continuing to work with my colleagues 
to ensure that all children can thrive 
in a safe and healthy environment. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
am honored to yield to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), former 
chair of the Appropriations Committee. 
HONORING FALLEN HEROES IN FLOYD COUNTY, 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Judge Gohmert for 
very graciously allowing me to speak 
before his main subject. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to the memory of three fallen 
heroes in eastern Kentucky. Last week 
we laid to rest three police officers and 
one service canine who were slain in 
the line of duty after enduring unex-
pected gunfire in Allen, Kentucky, on 
June 30, 2022. 
Among 
the 
fallen 
were 
William 
Petry, a 31-year law enforcement vet-
eran and the fire chief in Floyd Coun-
ty, Kentucky; Ralph Frasure, a 39-year 
law enforcement veteran and school re-
source officer; and Jacob Chaffins, was 
a 28-year-old police officer who just 
started his law enforcement career 3 
years ago and an active sergeant in the 
Kentucky Army National Guard. Also 
among the deceased was a beloved ca-
nine named Drago, a well-trained serv-
ice dog for the Floyd County Sheriff’s 
Department. 
Needless to say, the heartbreak and 
pain that have reverberated across 
eastern Kentucky at the loss of these 
brave men who dedicated their lives to 
serving and protecting our local people 
has been overwhelming. 
President Theodore Roosevelt, who 
was a former New York City Police 
Commissioner, once said, ‘‘No man is 
worth his salt who is not ready at all 
times to risk his body, to risk his well- 
being, to risk his life in a great cause.’’ 
On Thursday, June 30, 2022, these offi-
cers, and many other responders risked 
their lives as they valiantly answered 
the call to protect the people of the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Their heroic deaths represent a pow-
erful display of the selfless love de-
scribed in John 15:13, ‘‘Greater love has 
no one than this: to lay down one’s life 
for one’s friends.’’ 
Even as we speak, several other first 
responders are also fighting for their 
lives, recovering from their injuries 
from that horrific day, and our prayers 
are with them and with their families. 
In a Nation where police forces have 
been vilified in recent years by the ac-
tions of a few bad actors, may the lives 
of these brave men be a reminder of the 
outstanding 
integrity 
and 
sacrifice 
that the thin blue line represents. We 
must continue to support our law en-
forcement officers across the United 
States, 
ensuring 
they 
are 
fully 
equipped, adequately prepared, and 
never at the mercy of evildoers. 
This Nation owes a great debt of 
gratitude for the life and service of Of-
ficers Petry, Frasure, and Chaffins. 
May their loved ones find abundant 
peace and confidence in Matthew 5:9, 
‘‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they 
will be called the children of God.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I request to recog-
nize a moment of silence in memory of 
William Petry, Ralph Frasure, Jacob 
Chaffins, and K–9 Drago. 
b 1430 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what a very fitting and appropriate 
tribute to such selfless servants. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
REMEMBERING R.D. KINSEY 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from East Texas, Judge 
Gohmert, with whom I have had such a 
great association over these past sev-
eral years and thank him for his lead-
ership in this people’s House. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the 
life of a Vietnam veteran and leader in 
our Arkansas community, R.D. Kinsey, 
a great personal friend of mine, taken 
too suddenly last week. 
Following Kinsey’s honorable dis-
charge from the United States Air 
Force, he worked to serve his fellow 
Vietnam-era 
veterans 
by 
working 
alongside them and the VA to ensure 
that those heroes could obtain the ben-
efits they had earned during their time 
in service. 
Over time, R.D.’s mission expanded, 
and he worked with local veterans and 
their families to ensure that they had 
the healthcare and benefits that they 
had rightfully earned. R.D. dedicated 
his life to his fellow service heroes. 
In 2004, R.D. worked to establish the 
Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., American 
Legion Post 74 of North Little Rock, 
Arkansas, where he held the com-
mander position for 14 years. Under his 
leadership, Post 74 became known for 
their tremendous work in assisting vet-
erans across the State. Let me say per-
sonally, no one was more shipshape 
than Post 74. 
In 2018, R.D. became the first Afri-
can-American State commander in the 
history of the Department of Arkansas

when he assumed the leadership of the 
American Legion’s command for that 
1-year term. 
While serving in this capacity, R.D. 
led nearly 15,000 Arkansas military vet-
erans and their families in serving God 
and country. 
Up until R.D.’s passing, he served the 
National Legislative Commission, pre-
senting the National American Le-
gion’s agenda to the United States 
Congress on behalf of our Nation’s be-
loved veterans. 
R.D. dedicated his life to those vet-
erans and to their families. 
My sincerest condolences go out to 
his wife of 37 years, Dianna; his daugh-
ters, Meredith and Allison; and all who 
were honored to know him and call him 
a friend. 
R.D. and his life of service had a pro-
found impact on me, our veterans, our 
State, and I am honored to recognize 
him here today on the floor of the peo-
ple’s House. 
CONGRATULATING COLONEL NATE TODD 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Colonel Nate 
Todd, who currently serves as the Sec-
retary of the Arkansas Department of 
Veterans Affairs, on his recent appoint-
ment to the University of Arkansas 
Board of Trustees. 
Todd’s history of service began as a 
student at Pine Bluff High School, 
where Nate was a member of the Jun-
ior Air Force ROTC unit there. 
He would go on to graduate from the 
University of Arkansas with a Bachelor 
of Science degree in industrial tech-
nology and a master’s degree from 
Baylor University. Other achievements 
include a Chief Financial Officer Lead-
ership Certification from the National 
Defense 
University 
and 
graduation 
from the Executive Medical Leadership 
Course at George Washington Univer-
sity. 
Today, Todd is a 37-year veteran of 
the Army and Army Reserve where he 
has served as the director of Health Fi-
nancial Policy with the U.S. Army Sur-
geon General and chief financial officer 
for Walter Reed Army Medical Center 
in Washington. 
Those familiar with Colonel Todd’s 
leadership know of his decades-long de-
votion to the service of Arkansas and 
our Nation. Most recently, he has 
served at the appointment of Governor 
Asa Hutchinson as our State’s Vet-
erans Affairs Department head since 
early 2017. 
The students, faculty, and broader 
community of the University of Arkan-
sas system will benefit from the knowl-
edge, experience, and integrity that 
Colonel Todd brings in this new role. 
Congratulations 
to 
Colonel 
Nate 
Todd. I congratulate him for his con-
tinued service to the people of Arkan-
sas. 
THE CONTINUING WAR IN UKRAINE 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, today is 
the 141st day since Putin commenced 
his illegal, brutal invasion of Ukraine. 
Vladimir Putin continues to direct his 
gang of thugs to target Ukrainian ci-
vilians. 
We have seen this play from Czar 
Putin before, with the mass murder of 
25,000 souls in Grozny and the leveling 
of biblical Aleppo. 
To date, the United Nations High 
Commission has verified nearly 12,000 
civilian casualties across Ukraine since 
February. This number is understated. 
In the words of Nazar Havryliuk, a 
17-year-old from Bucha: ‘‘They were 
not able to defeat our Army, so they 
killed ordinary people.’’ 
Both his uncle and father, innocent 
civilians, were murdered by Putin’s in-
vading Army. 
Russian military strikes continue to 
target Ukrainian resources, including 
grain storehouses responsible for feed-
ing over 400 million people worldwide. 
The World Food Programme estimates 
that 47 million people across the globe 
are suffering from acute hunger as a di-
rect result of Putin’s targeting of 
Ukrainian stores. 
Since February, almost 2,300 schools, 
Madam Speaker, have been damaged or 
destroyed, and 290 healthcare facilities 
have 
been 
attacked. 
No 
place 
in 
Ukraine is safe for civilians. 
Currently, 12.1 million people in 
Ukraine are estimated to need health 
assistance. That is 12 million individ-
uals who are unable to get the help 
they need, the help they deserve, all 
due to Putin’s invasion. 
Madam Speaker, as my friend from 
Wisconsin just told this House, leader-
ship from the United States is essential 
now more than ever. President Biden 
must step up and ensure that Ukraine 
has the lethal weapons and supplies to 
achieve a prompt and decisive victory 
over the invaders. 
Only America’s President can stand 
in the breach and lead. That leadership 
of our transatlantic partners and our 
critical allies, like Japan, are essen-
tial, essential in assisting the Euro-
peans in crafting help for the people of 
Ukraine, including supporting humani-
tarian and critical and necessary and 
essential military support. 
The 
United 
States 
can 
support 
Ukraine directly also by supporting the 
U.N. Secretary General’s efforts to 
open the Black Sea. It is essential that 
safely exporting Ukrainian grain, cur-
rently trapped, is a must-do. The world 
is waiting for that grain. The world is 
starving without it. Helping alleviate 
that hunger crisis requires American 
leadership. 
While Putin’s puppets are in Istanbul 
sitting at a table talking about open-
ing the Black Sea, his military is sys-
tematically bombing and burning all 
the fields of wheat across Ukraine. 
America must also lead in planning 
for reconstruction in Ukraine once the 
invader has been ejected. 
We must also hold Putin and his cro-
nies accountable for the war crimes 
that they are committing daily in 
Ukraine. The targeting of schools, hos-
pitals, places of worship, and civilians 
is unacceptable, illegal, and immoral. 
Russian leaders will be held account-
able. 
I was pleased to see the National De-
fense Authorization Act continued to 
set that out as a basic tenet of Amer-
ican foreign policy, that we will hold 
these war criminals accountable. 
I will continue to voice my support 
for the brave people in Ukraine fight-
ing against an illegal invasion to pro-
tect their homeland, their freedom, and 
their sovereignty. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
working to craft the right way to sup-
port those Ukrainians in the distribu-
tion of needed resources worldwide and 
holding the Russian leaders account-
able for their crimes. This we must do, 
and this House must lead. Again, I 
must close, Madam Speaker, by saying 
it is American leadership that unites 
the world that can eject Putin from 
Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Texas, and I am grateful for the 
time. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
am very grateful for the message from 
my friend from Arkansas, words of wis-
dom that are greatly appreciated. 
One of the things we took up this 
afternoon on a vote here—and if I re-
call correctly, there were two of us vot-
ing no—but I know the people voting 
for the bill wanted to try to help with 
the issue of baby formula. But the bill 
was thrown upon Republicans last 
night, not exactly the best way to han-
dle legislation with far-reaching ef-
fects, and then voted on today. Well, 
let’s look at some of the facts. 
Here is an article: ‘‘Global infant for-
mula products market: estimations and 
forecasts for production and consump-
tion.’’ This points out that in 2017, the 
EU was the biggest supplier of infant 
formula, with one-third of global vol-
umes, with China and southeast Asia in 
second and third places respectively. 
Chinese companies have invested in 
ingredient and infant formula produc-
tion capacity in France and in the 
Netherlands and have strategic alli-
ances in Denmark and Ireland. So that 
way, when they produce it, they don’t 
have to say, ‘‘made in China,’’ which 
causes some people concern, especially 
when you have stories that exist, re-
ports where Chinese formula has done 
great damage. 
Here is a story from September of ’08: 
‘‘China: Fourth baby dies from tainted 
formula.’’ So Americans have reason to 
be concerned when we go buying baby 
formula that is manufactured by Chi-
nese companies, no matter where it is 
actually produced. 
Going back to this article, it says: 
‘‘China is the second largest infant for-
mula producer’’ and points out they do 
export some of their formula. 
But with this report about opening 
plants in other countries, it may give 
the impression and the appearance that 
these are not like the formulas that 
were created in China. 
So here is another line that says: ‘‘A 
lot of the global growth in infant for-
mula production will come from Chi-
nese companies investing in production 
capacity outside China.’’

So it is not enough to ask where was 
this produced; it is also important to 
ask: Who actually produced it; who is 
behind it? 
It is also surprising that we would 
get that bill late at night before people 
are expected to vote on it the next day 
when—here is an article from the BBC 
in May of 2022, and it indicates that the 
FDA said sales of infant formula rose 
13 percent in April compared to Janu-
ary before the recall, and some indica-
tors suggested that the out-of-stock 
rates had been overstated. It says: ‘‘In-
creased sales are a good indicator of 
formula available to the general popu-
lation.’’ 
b 1445 
Now, if you are in a place where you 
can’t find formula, then it is not much 
of a comfort that people are finding 
more in other places in the United 
States. But here it is: This should have 
gone through a committee. This should 
have had an opportunity not just for 
debate but for more research. It should 
be under what we normally try to do. 
Leadership from the parties tries to 
give 72 hours’ notice, but this bears 
looking at. 
I understand that the vote is only 
going to go until the end of the year, 
but as Ronald Regan said, the closest 
thing to eternal life here on Earth is a 
Federal Government program. I have 
seen in my years in Congress things 
that are only going to be a matter of 
months, just 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 
but they are still going on. It happens 
over and over. 
We have been told, oh, this is going 
to sunset, and that will be the end of it. 
Then, we get pressure brought to bear 
on enough Members that those sunsets 
are reset to further years down the 
road. 
When it comes to baby formula, 
American babies should have enough 
American formula produced to take 
care of them where we have—and obvi-
ously, the FDA has shown in the last 
few years that they can be totally in-
competent in so many areas. They can 
have decisions appear to be totally 
based on money rather than the best 
interests of Americans. The FDA has 
shown that they don’t care about it 
being your body, your choice. They 
would rather force you to have injected 
into your body what they tell you to 
inject, especially when it makes bil-
lions of dollars for pharmaceutical 
companies that are under an emer-
gency use authorization so the compa-
nies have no liability for the death and 
injuries that they cause. 
In the case of baby formula, we find 
out in an article that indicates that al-
ready the Abbott facility is at 95 per-
cent of what it was before the FDA 
shut them down and created problems 
in doing that without proper regard. 
It seems like this bill was a rush to 
get done without properly considering 
what this would mean. Whether it is 
intentional or not, what we keep seeing 
here are bills that pass through this 
House that end up making profits for 
Russia, China, Iran, OPEC, countries 
that hate us. 
As I have said from years ago when I 
started pointing this out, whether it is 
paying countries that vote against us 
more than half the time in the U.N. or 
bills quickly passed like this that are 
going to provide profits to other coun-
tries, we don’t have to pay people to 
hate us. They will do it for free. 
Shouldn’t we use profits strategically 
and quit helping those that want to de-
stroy America for all time? If you just 
look at the Ukraine invasion by Rus-
sia, the policies, decisions, executive 
orders, things that have been pushed 
through by this White House, pushed 
through Congress by this White House, 
the Biden administration, Russia has 
made so much profit because of what 
this White House has done that they 
have been able to fund the war and the 
invasion in Ukraine. 
On the other hand, we have had the 
same administration rush in and get 
Democrat leaders in the House and 
Senate to pass bills that would—well, 
we had $13 billion, $40 billion, we have 
had other bills that we have to pass 
this to help Ukraine. Well, I voted 
against the last one because there were 
simply not—I want to help Ukraine. 
I have a special place in my heart for 
Ukraine, having been an exchange stu-
dent in Ukraine back in the seventies. 
I grew to love so many of the people 
there. It is a good place. They are good 
people. Of course, they were corrupted 
by a Marxist system, as every country 
that attempts Marxist systems is. But 
as a farmer on a massive collective 
farm explained to me when I asked, in 
the best Russian I could muster, 
‘‘When do you work out in the field?’’ 
because they were sitting there in the 
shade in the middle of the morning, he 
said, in Russian, ‘‘I make the same 
number of rubles if I am out there in 
the sun as I make in the shade, so I 
stay in the shade.’’ 
Well, the Soviet system was able to 
crush the amount of produce that could 
be generated in Ukraine and have done 
much better without the Marxist-So-
viet system as far as production. 
But I would like to be assured by the 
bills we pass that money is going to be 
utilized for what is intended. When you 
are giving tens of billions of dollars to 
an administration that just carelessly 
and callously leaves $85 billion of 
equipment in the hands of our enemies 
that killed 3,000 people on 9/11 and 
would like to kill all the Americans 
they can, then we need to be more 
careful in what we pass in this Cham-
ber because this administration cannot 
be trusted. 
I have never indicated that I believe 
the administration wanted American 
soldiers killed in Afghanistan because I 
don’t believe that. I just believe their 
incompetence is at such a level, their 
lack of judgment is at such a level, 
that they made it possible that 13 sol-
diers could be killed on what should 
have been a peaceful exit if it had been 
properly done and if we had properly 
utilized the assistance of our allies, the 
former Northern Alliance that fought 
and originally defeated the Taliban 
with about 300 special operators from 
the U.S. There shouldn’t have been any 
Americans who were killed in leaving 
Afghanistan. But then to leave that 
much equipment, that just cries out 
that this administration is incom-
petent, that the leaders in the Pen-
tagon are incompetent. 
They continue to say climate change 
is the biggest threat, but let me tell 
you, there was not a single military 
servicemember who was killed in Af-
ghanistan by climate change. Those 13 
who were killed, it wasn’t climate 
change. It was incompetence by this 
administration, the poor judgment by 
this administration, that got our peo-
ple killed. 
There will be more Americans killed, 
as our former allies that initially de-
feated the Taliban by early 2002 told 
me in multiple visits. For years, they 
were saying: You can’t stay here for-
ever. You end up like occupiers. It is 
not good for you, and it is not good for 
us. But for heaven’s sake, don’t leave 
the country so that the Taliban is 
going to take over and kill off all of us 
who helped America. Don’t do that be-
cause they will kill us off, and the 
Taliban will still want to destroy 
America. But next time they hit you 
and kill thousands of people and you 
want to come to take on the Taliban in 
Afghanistan, we will all be dead. Ev-
erybody that helped you will be dead. 
There will be nobody to help you here. 
They were trying to warn us not to 
negotiate with the Taliban, just defeat 
the Taliban and leave, and leave them 
in a position in Afghanistan to defeat 
the Taliban when they tried to rise 
again. 
This administration did exactly the 
opposite. They negotiated with the 
Taliban. They left them $85 billion of 
equipment to help kill Americans in 
the future and our allies in the future. 
It sent a message to China and Russia 
that if you want to invade another 
country, if you want to take over an 
area where the U.S. was once the 
prominent force to be reckoned with, 
do it now because the administration 
in charge of America is too incom-
petent to do anything about whatever 
imperialistic moves you want to make. 
That was the message this administra-
tion sent. 
We need more safeguards. I think 
about a predecessor of mine, Charlie 
Wilson. As some constituents have said 
over the years, Charlie had a lot of per-
sonal issues, problems, but he was al-
ways honest about them. Charlie was 
on appropriations, and he knew how to 
leverage appropriations, as the Found-
ers knew. They gave us the power of 
the purse, yet this Chamber doesn’t use 
our leverage to get good governance 
out of a faulty administration. We just 
rush to give them sacks and sacks of 
tens and hundreds of billions of dollars 
so they can throw it around wherever 
they want it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6670 
July 15, 2022 
I was shocked to see that this admin-
istration, for the first time in the his-
tory of the United States of America, 
is promoting atheism and humanism. 
They are providing grants, as I under-
stand it, through the State Depart-
ment to groups in other countries that 
will encourage atheism in those coun-
tries. They will provide grants to other 
groups. To be providing funds, grants, 
to export atheism makes it clear that 
this administration is going to create 
chaos around the world. 
As John Adams said, and it can’t be 
said too often, this Constitution was 
intended for a moral and religious peo-
ple. It is wholly inadequate for the gov-
ernance of any other. Unless we are 
going to get back to teaching moral ab-
solutes, some things are just wrong, 
and some things are right. If you are 
not going to teach those moral impera-
tives that we have had throughout our 
country—the Supreme Court said, no, 
you have to stop with those. The Ten 
Commandments, no, don’t be teaching 
that. Somebody might think it is im-
proper to murder. You don’t want to 
let that be taught in schools or brought 
up in public areas. Get rid of those. 
John Adams knew. George Wash-
ington knew. He talked about the im-
perative nature of teaching morality 
and religion. Atheism is the absence of 
religion. It is not a religion. Yet, this 
administration, heavily funded by this 
body, is going around the world saying, 
yes, we want to give you money if you 
are going to spread atheism and hu-
manism where we teach people to be as 
selfish as they possibly can be. 
b 1500 
This country won’t continue to go on 
as an experiment in self-government 
because you are going to have to get 
rid of the Second Amendment. You are 
going to have to get rid of the right to 
be protected from unreasonable search 
and seizure. You are going to have to 
get rid of the freedom of assembly. You 
will have to get rid of freedom of 
speech. You can’t have freedom of reli-
gion. We are going to have to basically 
get rid of the Constitution. 
I would prefer to do what the Found-
ers talked about—sure, there has never 
been one perfect human being in all of 
history—none were perfect. The amaz-
ing thing about the Founders is they 
recognized their imperfection. They 
even put it in writing because they un-
derstood the importance of all people 
being equal and that all people were 
endowed with rights not from man-
kind, but from God. 
When you fail to recognize that, then 
it is very easy to take away people’s 
rights because, you know, who are 
they? 
If you believe what the Bible taught 
and teaches, we are created in God’s 
image—and I don’t think it was in a 
physical image—but if created in the 
creator’s image then people, every sin-
gle person, is worthy of being free and 
worthy of having rights as pronounced 
in our Bill of Rights and our Constitu-
tion. 
We are at a very precarious situation 
in our history. We have had those be-
fore. The Founders, like Thomas Jef-
ferson—yeah, he had slaves, but go 
look at his original copy of the Dec-
laration of Independence. He made 
clear that slavery was a scourge, it was 
an abomination, it was a harmful 
thing, it was a grievance that the 
Founders had against King George III 
because he should never have allowed 
slavery to get a foothold at all, and 
that it was going to help destroy the 
country. 
He recognized this was a problem. It 
got taken out of the final draft. But 
you had Founders that recognized, 
yeah, they knew it was hypocritical to 
have slaves and talk about how wrong 
slavery was. They were trying to put 
together a government, a country, with 
freedoms that would last, but they un-
derstood how precarious that was. 
They understood that no government 
ever lasts forever. They tried to give us 
the best instruments they could. 
I read, of course, that Jefferson was 
not there for the Constitutional Con-
vention but sent a letter after he read 
it saying that if I could change one 
thing, I would make it a requirement 
that any bill had to be on file for a 
year before it could be voted on. Well, 
that would have kept us from voting on 
this bill that rushes in as formula pro-
duction is getting back close to where 
it was in January. We rush in at the 
last minute, and say: No, no, we are 
going to allow people to buy more Chi-
nese milk wherever they choose to 
make it. 
Isn’t it interesting, we keep doing 
things that end up profiting countries 
that hate us. 
That brings me to the topic of fuel. It 
is rather ironic—there is an article 
from the Gateway Pundit. There is a 
Houston television station doing a 
story on the wind turbines in Texas as 
ERCOT was created to create policies 
and oversee our energy production in 
Texas. 
We haven’t really had problems with 
energy production until we got ERCOT. 
Of course, they were putting so much 
emphasis in green energy that we had a 
terrible power outage in winter. They 
were taking care of spending more and 
more on windmills and solar, but they 
didn’t follow the advice of a study that 
said you need to winterize the natural 
gas connections—so they weren’t win-
terized, and we had a failure. 
In this story: ‘‘Texas grid operator 
ERCOT was forced to take unprece-
dented 
emergency 
measures 
on 
Wednesday to avoid rolling blackouts 
amid a heat wave as wind turbines 
failed to produce energy due to low 
winds.’’ 
Amazing. Those of us who have lived 
in Texas all our lives—well, I had 4 
years in Fort Benning, Georgia—but 
otherwise, we know that often in the 
hottest part of the summer the wind 
doesn’t blow and the turbines won’t 
turn. We need air conditioning more 
than ever. 
Yet, in my district and adjoining 
areas, they closed a couple of coal 
power plants. They had plenty of scrub-
bers on them to help have clean air. 
Cleaner production of power than any 
coal plant in other countries of the 
world. China is going to add another 
hundred to the hundred they just 
opened. They are not going to be near 
as clean as we had in east Texas. There 
are a couple more in my district that 
are scheduled to be closed. 
We are creating a situation where 
people will die because that always 
happens when we don’t have sufficient 
power, people don’t have air condi-
tioning, and the heat gets them. 
The article says: ‘‘ERCOT manages 
electric power to more than 26 million 
Texas customers and represents 90 per-
cent of the State’s electric load. . . . 
‘‘On Monday ERCOT asked customers 
to voluntarily raise thermostats a de-
gree or two, turn off lights, avoid using 
ovens, washing machines and dryers. 
. . . ‘’ 
This is Texas. We create ERCOT and 
what happens? 
They go nuts on green energy. Now 
we are going to have what Gray Davis 
used to have, called Gray-outs, in 
Texas. We got plenty of fuel. We have 
lost our minds. Maybe we would be bet-
ter off without ERCOT. 
Here is an article from Tucker Carl-
son. This is from July 12. I am going to 
read some of it. 
He said: ‘‘Voters, it turns out, are not 
into any of those things and so nothing 
that resembles the Green New Deal is 
going to pass the United States Con-
gress in our lifetimes’’—I am hoping 
not—‘‘provided this remains an actual 
democracy, which is to say, provided 
the public has anything to say about 
how they’re governed. 
‘‘That’s a nonstarter here. It’s never 
going to happen by democratic means, 
but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen. 
It doesn’t mean that ideologues can’t 
impose the Green New Deal on weaker 
countries that are too poor to refuse it, 
and over the past several years, that’s 
exactly what they’ve done. So the 
Green New Deal is actually taking ef-
fect around the world. So, we don’t 
have to guess what would happen if it 
took effect here. We can know. That’s 
the science. 
‘‘Let’s start with Ghana. Ghana’s a 
pretty little country, peaceful place, 
actually, on the west coast of Africa. 
Three years ago, Ghana was in great 
shape. It had one of the fastest-growing 
economies in the world. In fact, it had 
so much energy over most of the last 
decade, it was exporting it to its neigh-
bors in West Africa. 
‘‘Now, those energy exports from 
Ghana peaked in 2014. Why that year? 
Well, because the next year, the World 
Bank published this headline on its 
website, ‘World Bank approves largest- 
ever guarantees for Ghana’s Energy 
Transformation.’ Oh, when they prom-
ise to transform your energy, slow 
down. 
‘‘But Ghana didn’t slow down. They 
just kept going. The World Bank prom-
ised to provide, and we’re quoting,

July 15, 2022 
‘technical assistance for energy sector 
reforms and the drafting of a new re-
newable energy law.’ So, in return for 
all this help, Ghana agreed to limit its 
carbon emissions, and then they en-
tered the Paris climate agreement. Oh, 
how virtuous. 
‘‘What happened next? This is the 
part you don’t read that much about. 
Last year, Ghana experienced a com-
plete shutdown of its national power 
supply. No more electricity, no emis-
sions because we have no electricity, 
and blackouts have continued since 
then. Just yesterday, a news source in 
Ghana reported that, ‘Residents in 
parts of the Ashanti region who have 
been hit with power cuts are without 
water as well,’ because it turns out you 
need electricity to provide water also 
to grow food. Now, this is not a small 
thing. The Ashanti region has millions 
of people living in it. They’re all now 
living in the Stone Age and it’s not 
just the energy grid that’s now com-
promised in Ghana. 
‘‘International 
observers 
say 
the 
country is now facing severe food 
shortages and hunger, starvation with-
in a matter of months. Why is that? 
It’s a fertile country, hardworking peo-
ple. Now they’re running out of fer-
tilizer. Why? Well, because for years, 
Sandy Cortez’s friends in the NGO com-
munity pushed Ghana toward less effi-
cient, more expensive organic fer-
tilizers and the government of Ghana, 
because it’s not a rich government, 
caved. Last year, according to Ghana’s 
news 
service, 
Ghana’s 
agricultural 
minister ‘urged local farmers to adopt 
an organic agriculture system to re-
duce the impact of climate change.’ 
‘‘Oh, what happened then? Well, the 
good people of Ghana, while they feel 
good about their fight against climate 
change, are now starving and in June, 
last month, police in Ghana used water 
and tear gas to attack hundreds of 
demonstrators in Accra, which is the 
capital of Ghana. 
‘‘It’s not just Ghana. The same thing 
just happened in Sri Lanka. In 2016, the 
World Economic Forum published an 
article by a Columbia professor called 
Joseph Stiglitz, one of the dumbest 
people on planet Earth, urging Ghana 
to transition to ‘high productivity or-
ganic farming.’ Now, what does Stiglitz 
know about farming? Ever farmed? No, 
but he felt strongly that Sri Lanka 
should try a new kind of farming and of 
course sold it to Sri Lankans as a path-
way to prosperity.’’ 
Again, this is Tucker Carlson. 
‘‘In 2015, the World Economic Forum 
published an article on its website enti-
tled, and we are quoting, ‘This is how 
we will make Sri Lanka rich by 2025.’ 
You can search for that article, but it’s 
gone now along with the government of 
Sri Lanka. So, they had an actual in-
surrection, not January 6, not a guy in 
horns, in a bearskin, running around on 
mushrooms, making weird noises. No, 
an actual insurrection where they like, 
come to your house and swim in your 
swimming pool, root through your sock 
drawer and make you leave. That’s 
what they did to the people who run 
Sri Lanka. They, being the public. 
‘‘The turning point came in 2021 when 
the president of Sri Lanka, acting on 
advice 
from 
the 
World 
Economic 
Forum, banned the use and importa-
tion of chemical fertilizers. Now, the 
problem was virtually every farm in 
Sri Lanka uses those fertilizers to 
produce food, which it turns out people 
need every day in order to survive. As 
a result of that move, food prices in Sri 
Lanka nearly doubled. Millions more 
Sri Lankans now live in poverty, which 
is not a joke and because the economy 
has collapsed, Sri Lanka now cannot 
afford fuel imports. So, Sri Lankans 
are now waiting days for gasoline. 
Watch.’’ 
b 1515 
Then he has the story there from Sri 
Lanka: 
‘‘What’s so interesting is millions of 
people are now really suffering. The 
government just fell in Sri Lanka. 
Now, no one in Sri Lanka is White. 
They are what our Democratic Party 
would call people of color and yet the 
American intellectuals who pushed 
that disaster in Sri Lanka, who are re-
sponsible for the suffering there, have 
all escaped culpability. No one is say-
ing a word about it.’’ 
‘‘The 
Netherlands, 
for 
example, 
which is a very rich country, the sec-
ond-biggest food exporter in the world, 
tried to do, for reasons that are not 
clear but may have to do with Western 
guilt, the same thing that leaders in 
Sri Lanka tried to do. They just or-
dered farmers to cut virtually all of 
their nitrogen oxide emissions to ‘save 
the environment.’ Now, doing that 
would shutter most farms in the Neth-
erlands and destroy the country’s food 
supply and once again, that led to 
riots. So, everything that’s happened 
in Sri Lanka and Ghana and the Neth-
erlands is happening at the behest not 
simply of ideologues, but of some of the 
largest financial institutions in the 
world. 
‘‘They want more of this. It’s why 
Ghana has achieved a near-perfect ESG 
environmental impact score of 97.7. Ac-
cording to World Economic Research, 
Sri Lanka has an ESG score of 98.1, the 
Netherlands 90.7. So, the poorer you 
get, the more human suffering there is, 
the higher your ESG score, and that is 
important because companies will not 
invest unless you have a high ESG 
score. Interesting. So, these countries 
have no choice and that’s why South 
Africa, for example, works so hard to 
get an ESG score that now totals 91. 
‘‘Now, that effort began in 2015 when 
South Africa switched to renewables. 
Now, how did that work? Well, like ev-
erything in South Africa, no one in 
America really wants to know. It’s 
their favorite country. It’s a huge suc-
cess. What’s life like in South Africa 
for people of all colors?’’ ‘‘Well, the 
Guardian, of all places reported at the 
time, and we are quoting ‘solar, bio-
mass and wind energy systems are pop-
ping up all over the country and feed-
ing the clean energy into this strained 
electrical grid.’ 
‘‘So their grids have been falling 
apart since 1994, but no problem. The 
green energy geniuses are going to save 
South Africa. How did that work? 
‘‘Well, 7 years later, The Washington 
Post reports that South Africa regu-
larly experiences ‘rolling blackouts 
that last 8 hours or more, crippling 
economic activity and disrupting life 
in this nation of 60 million people,’ 
. . .’’ ‘‘Ask anybody who lives there. It 
is falling apart. Doesn’t work. 
‘‘Also join France. France is com-
mitted to renewable energy. How is 
that working? Well, France currently 
has an ESG environmental score of 
92.6. Why? Because 10 years ago France 
pledged to drive a quarter of all of its 
energy from renewables in 2018. These 
policies led to riots.’’ 
He goes on to talk about how much 
chaos it created for France. 
In everyplace that it has been tried 
with this green energy, it has fallen 
apart—every single one—with no ex-
ceptions: Albania, Kenya, Argentina, 
Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Libya, and so 
on. 
But it is not just a problem there, it 
is becoming a problem here. 
United States’ ESG scoring on envi-
ronmental issues currently stands at 
58. But Joe Biden—who buys into every 
stupid trend—wants to change that. It 
is very important to get our ESG score 
up. 
Madam Speaker, you see in history, 
and you see around the world that 
when Marxists want to take over, they 
take advantage of weaknesses, and 
they exploit them. What they have 
seen America, exploit this green energy 
deal in the name of saving the world, 
and, yes, there will be riots. 
For the morons that say I promote 
violence, I have never promoted vio-
lence. I have promoted using our insti-
tutions that were created to peacefully 
resolve them. As a historian, it is clear 
that 
Dr. 
King’s 
peaceful 
methods 
worked best toward bringing about 
needed change. But as a historian, 
Madam Speaker, you have to note that 
when our institutions don’t do their 
jobs, then you end up with violence. I 
don’t want violence, but that is what 
happens. 
It is happening in these countries 
that have gotten their ESG score up 
and people start starving and they see 
their families suffering. We can avoid 
all that. But we have got to stop the 
insanity. 
What does it really come back to? 
This: I saw it in the Soviet Union as 
a college student, and I am seeing it 
happening now. I thought socialism, 
Communism, and progressivism, what-
ever you want to call it, I thought it 
was dead because it fails every time it 
is tried. 
There is a tiny, elite ruling class 
when you have Marxism, socialism, and 
progressivism—a tiny, little, elite rul-
ing class. They will have power. They

will have electricity. They will have 
what they need. They will have food to 
eat. You might hear some of them be-
hind closed doors say: Let them eat 
cake or bugs. 
We are being told: Eat bugs. Because 
your countries are going broke because 
they are trying to get up their ESG 
scores. It is unnecessary. 
We have people saying: You have to 
get rid of your car. You can’t have a 
car. That gives you too much freedom. 
You are a peasant. We want to get back 
to the Middle Ages, these people say, 
who want to be part of the elite ruling 
class. Yes. Let’s get back to Middle 
Age mentality where we have peasants, 
and they walk everywhere, and the 
elite ruling class gets to ride in style. 
No. We had the greatest, freest, and 
most wonderful country. Sure, it had 
problems. Every country has problems. 
But it was the best that has ever been. 
Now we are destroying it, and we are 
going back to a time when elitists will 
fly around in their private jets and ev-
erybody else will have to walk. 
Now, let’s get back to freedom across 
the board. We cannot do it if we do not 
take notice and usage of the things 
with which this country has been 
blessed more than any other. 
We had another bill to put off limits 
more uranium. Well, don’t worry. When 
Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State 
we sold, I think, about 20 percent of our 
uranium available to Russia. Of course, 
she made a lot of money for the Clin-
ton Foundation, and Bill Clinton got 
paid a lot of money. They were able to 
get that sale through. 
Wasn’t that great? 
Continuing to put uranium off limits, 
we should have had rare-earth metals 
that we were able to get from Afghani-
stan, but this administration’s incom-
petence left that in the hands of China 
that has most now of the rare-earth 
minerals. Every week it seems like—at 
least every month—we are putting 
more of our own blessed rare-earth 
metals and minerals of all kinds off 
limits because we are going to drive 
this country back to the Middle Ages, 
and people will be eating bugs as they 
are being encouraged to do around the 
world. 
We need to have freedom and not 
have Congress push us back to the Mid-
dle Ages and push us back to the age of 
elitism or like it was in the Soviet 
Union. 
We were told before the eight of us 
went over there that only the elite 
have cars in the Soviet Union. To them 
it is a game. Don’t think for a minute 
pedestrians have the right-of-way be-
cause they looked at them as peasants, 
and they tried to hit them. Boy, did I 
see that. I couldn’t believe it. So you 
had to be careful because somebody is 
in a car, and they are going to try to 
hit you. They did, a number of times. 
That is where we are going back to. 
We are going to have Marxist peasants 
and Marxist elitists if we don’t stop the 
insanity. It needs to stop now. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate what 
Tucker Carlson put together so we can 
share here, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HIGHLAND PARK VICTIMS AND 
HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the brave men and 
women of Highland Park. 
Independence Day in Highland Park, 
as it is in so many other places around 
our country, is a special day. Today 
families gather—whether it be at a bar-
becue or a park or wherever it might 
be—and they celebrate the birth of our 
country and the ideals of who we are as 
a nation and all that we aspire to be. 
The Highland Park parade is a very, 
very important centerpiece of our com-
munity. 
Prior 
to 
COVID, 
families 
would gather, putting their chairs out 
sometimes the day of or even 2 days be-
fore planning exactly where they would 
sit to have the best view knowing that 
their kids or maybe grandkids, their 
classmates, 
and 
members 
of 
their 
church or synagogue or their service 
organization would be marching in the 
parade, and they would want to be able 
to look, wave, and say hello. 
This year was different though. This 
year was the first parade since 2019 be-
cause in 2020 and 2021 the parade was 
canceled due to COVID. 
There was a special excitement, and 
there was a special feeling in anticipa-
tion of the parade this year. Finally, 
we were back together as a commu-
nity. 
Highland Park is a special commu-
nity. It is a city of roughly 30,000 peo-
ple but with a small-town feel. Neigh-
bors look after each other. People 
know each other. The restaurants in 
the community are frequented by the 
locals. Everyone has their favorite, and 
you are seeing old friends every time 
you go in. 
This year the parade was going to be 
special. At 10 o’clock, the time the pa-
rade starts every year, the excitement 
swells. Groups start walking along the 
path up St. Johns Avenue and up the 
hill to Central where everyone takes a 
left turn. They walk across the train 
tracks, proceed past 1st Street, then 
2nd, all the way through the downtown 
to Green Bay, and then down the hill 
toward the Post Office reaching Sun-
set, and turning into Sunset Park at 
the end of the parade. 
The parade started on time at 10 
o’clock. The first groups walked up the 
hill and made that left turn. People 
were cheering, celebrating, and smil-
ing. The first groups made the left 
turn, crossed 1st, crossed 2nd. The sec-
ond group passed, the third, and the 
fourth. 
At 10:14 everything changed. What 
initially sounded like firecrackers— 
and sure, why not? it is the Fourth of 
July—people quickly realized it was a 
different sound altogether. Those who 
were right there at the corner of 2nd 
and Central looked and saw that people 
were falling and people were bleeding. 
At 10:14 a.m. on July 4th, 2022, the 
Independence Day parade was shat-
tered when a monster with a high-pow-
ered military-style assault weapon, 
having climbed a roof dressed as a 
woman to hide himself as he would 
leave, leaned over the edge and fired 83 
shots in 1 minute. Eighty-three shots 
struck the parade goers below killing 
seven, wounding dozens, and changing 
a community forever. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor my community. I rise today to 
talk about those who were murdered, 
to talk about the survivors, and to 
share their stories. It is important to 
share their stories, and it is important 
that these stories are told and are 
heard. 
Let me begin by talking about the 
seven wonderful people, the precious 
lives that we lost: Stephen Straus, 
Katherine Goldstein, Nicolas Toledo- 
Zaragoza, Jackie Sundheim, Eduardo 
Uvaldo, Irina McCarthy, and Kevin 
McCarthy. 
Stephen Straus, an 88-year-old long-
time resident of Highland Park, still 
commuted by train to work in down-
town Chicago to his office 5 days a 
week working as a financial adviser. 
His niece described him as ‘‘a big, big 
oak tree, an umbrella of well-being for 
all of us.’’ 
b 1530 
Stephen is survived by his wife, 
Linda, with whom he had been married 
for almost 60 years, 60 wonderful years. 
He leaves his brother, his two sons, his 
four grandchildren. 
On that tragic day, Stephen’s son was 
in San Francisco. He had called to wish 
him a happy Fourth of July, but Ste-
phen didn’t answer the phone. Of 
course, as the news from Highland 
Park started coming out, his son soon 
realized that his father would not be 
calling him back. 
Katherine Goldstein was the best 
mom in the world to her daughters. 
Neighbors described her as a welcoming 
and lovely person, bringing them baked 
goods during the holidays. 
On July Fourth, Katherine and one of 
her two daughters decided to leave the 
house and have fun because Katherine 
had been mourning the recent passing 
of her mother. 
As the bullets started raining down, 
her daughter turned and said to run. 
But Katherine fell to the ground. Her 
daughter Cassie shared this on the 
news in an interview. She turned to her 
mother, saw that her mother was gone. 
She knelt down beside her mother and 
said good-bye, but, Mom, I have to 
keep running, as the bullets continued 
to fly. 
Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza was a 76- 
year-old retiree from Morelos, Mexico. 
He 
spent 
many 
years 
in 
the 
Chicagoland area. He had returned to

the United States to spend time with 
his family before fulfilling his desire to 
rest 
in 
his 
beloved 
homeland 
of 
Morelos. 
Nicolas was a loving father to eight 
children and 25 grandchildren. 
On the day of the parade, Nicolas was 
smiling in his wheelchair as horses 
marched down the street when his fam-
ily began to live a nightmare with 
sounds of gunshots. Nicolas was sud-
denly struck and killed. Members of his 
family were also wounded. 
Now, Nicolas’ family looks to him as 
a guardian angel as they work together 
to hold their family united in their 
grief. 
Jackie Sundheim was 63 years old. 
She loved to rescue dogs and was a life-
long employee, member, and center-
piece of North Shore Congregation 
Israel. Her kindness and work touched 
everyone in her congregation and even 
those beyond. 
She was the events coordinator. She 
worked with everyone in the congrega-
tion who celebrated bar and bat mitz-
vahs, weddings, events that were cele-
brations to bring family together. But 
she also worked with the caterers and 
the florists, many of whom came to her 
funeral. 
Jackie never lacked a smile or a hug 
for anybody. In fact, she was there for 
everybody. 
She is survived by her husband, her 
daughter, and an entire community 
devastated at the loss of such a caring 
person. 
Eduardo Uvaldo is survived by his 
wife, Maria, 4 daughters, 12 grand-
children, and 6 great-grandchildren. 
Actually, I think he has 13 grand-
children. 
He was born in Mexico and was loved 
as a jovial bowling champion. I talked 
to his kids about his love for bowling. 
Eduardo happily attended the parade 
with his children and grandchildren. 
Later that day, after the shooting, his 
daughters were pleading with the en-
tire community on social media to join 
them in prayer as Eduardo fought val-
iantly to survive. The family began to 
pray for strength. The community 
prayed with them. 
Eduardo was incredibly affectionate 
with everyone in his family but espe-
cially his grandchildren. He loved see-
ing and spending time on these special 
occasions and would take a photo with 
his grandson every year. On that Mon-
day, that fateful Monday, his daughter 
couldn’t take a photo, and now she be-
lieves that God did not want her to 
have a reminder of that day. 
Irina and Kevin McCarthy met while 
working together. They married about 
5 years ago and moved to Highland 
Park in 2018. The couple had a 2-year- 
old son named Aiden, whom Irina and 
her husband, Kevin, were obsessed 
with. 
On July Fourth, they joined together 
and went to the parade. They were 
right at the corner. When the gunshots 
started, Kevin and Irina did what all 
parents do; they covered Aiden’s body 
to protect him. In defending their son, 
they sacrificed themselves. 
Aiden was found wandering the area, 
covered in blood after the gunfire. The 
Ring family took Aiden to their home. 
He played with their 2-year-old daugh-
ter after they cleaned him up and 
watched TV with the Ring grandfather. 
Eventually, Aiden was reunited with 
his grandfather, of course, because 
Aiden was now an orphan. His parents 
had been murdered. When Aiden’s 
grandfather picked him up, Aiden had a 
single question: Are mommy and daddy 
coming soon? 
Irina was 35 years old. Kevin was 37. 
They were deprived of the most pre-
cious thing, being parents to their 
child, being able to raise him, to cele-
brate his birthdays, his adulthood, 
wedding, and maybe children of his 
own. 
The community is united behind 
Aiden. The community struggles to 
fathom how this is possible. 
Aiden will now grow up having only 
the memory of his parents, not the 
hugs and not the love that he deserves. 
Aiden is not the only innocent child 
whose life has been changed. Many 
have been injured and wounded. Among 
them, most grievously, is Cooper Rob-
erts, a vibrant, beautiful 8-year-old boy 
who, as I speak, is fighting for his life 
in the hospital. 
Cooper was at the parade with his 
family, his twin brother, his parents. 
His mother was also shot. His brother 
was 
wounded. 
When 
his 
mother 
learned, after her surgery, that Coo-
per’s spinal cord had been severed, she 
demanded to be immediately released 
from the hospital so she could be by his 
side, as every mother would do. 
Cooper’s injuries, besides the severed 
spinal cord, continue. He has had a 
torn esophagus, infections, and a col-
lapsed lung. Already, Cooper has had 
seven surgeries and is kept sedated be-
cause of the pain. 
During a brief moment of conscious-
ness, Cooper asked to see his twin 
brother and his dog. The family con-
tinues to keep the community updated, 
and our entire community and I are 
praying for Cooper’s recovery. 
Cooper’s life and the lives of many 
others have been saved because of the 
work of emergency medics, police, fire-
fighters, nurses, and doctors, who have 
gone to extraordinary lengths to meet 
the needs of our community. I would 
like to take some time to reflect on 
and celebrate some of those heroes. 
I mentioned the parade had just 
started. Many groups had gone by. One 
of the groups that had just crossed over 
Second Street were the firefighters on 
the truck celebrating. Because in High-
land Park, as I mentioned, we are, like 
everywhere around the country, a 
small town where it is home for so 
many people, the fire truck wasn’t just 
the firefighters on the truck. It was 
their families, their wives, and their 
kids because they are all a part of our 
community. 
As the shots rang out, firefighters re-
alized what was going on. Concerned 
for their kids, they rushed the truck 
ahead to keep their kids safe. But 
those firefighters, without hesitation 
of a second, turned around and ran 
back to the corner into the fire to 
make sure that everyone was safe. 
The Highland Park Fire Department 
transported 24 patients and adminis-
tered CPR to many more. Highland 
Park Fire Chief Joe Schrage recalls 
one man, on his own, tied 15 tour-
niquets that day—one man, 15 tour-
niquets. 
It is more than just the firefighters. 
I will come back to the police in a sec-
ond. These are trained professionals. 
They behaved the way they were 
trained, and they were extraordinary. 
There are also many people who may 
have been medically trained, but not 
for a situation like this. They re-
sponded as true American heroes do. 
Bobby Shapiro is a tech salesman. In 
fact, he has no medical training. But 
suddenly, in the flash of a moment, he 
became a first responder and began 
doing whatever he could to help. 
He found an elderly man with a gun-
shot wound to his thigh and abdomen. 
Bobby and another bystander gave the 
man chest compressions. They applied 
pressure to his wounds as Dr. Wendy 
Rush, an anesthesiologist at the pa-
rade, helped the man to breathe. After 
30 minutes, Bobby boarded an ambu-
lance with the elderly man and stayed 
by his side all the way to the hospital. 
The man Bobby stood by was Stephen 
Straus, one of the seven victims that 
day. 
Bobby wasn’t alone, though. Police 
Commander Gerry Cameron also at-
tended to Stephen Straus. He made 
sure that Stephen Straus wouldn’t be 
alone because, as I said, Highland Park 
is a community that many of us call 
home, and we treat each other as if 
they are family. 
David Baum, Dr. David Baum, a fix-
ture of Highland Park, who has been 
there so long—I shouldn’t say ‘‘so 
long.’’ Dr. Baum delivered our two 
sons, nearly 30 years ago, our oldest 
son, and then less than 2 years later, 
our younger son. 
I have seen Dr. Baum under pressure. 
I have seen Dr. Baum perform with 
care and compassion. 
Dr. Baum, after the shooting, after 
sheltering initially behind a bench 
with David Saleck, rushed to treat bod-
ies he could only describe as having 
wartime injuries. He didn’t know where 
the shooter was. He didn’t know if the 
shooting had finished. In fact, he didn’t 
know that the shooter wouldn’t be 
caught for 8 hours. But he knew he had 
to help, and that is what he did. 
Lake County Sheriff John Idleburg 
was waiting to start the parade. I walk 
in many parades with John. I know 
him as a wonderful person. My group 
was in the same location, and as soon 
as the firing started, the people who 
were waiting all immediately cleared 
out of the area. Not John Idleburg. 
John Idleburg, as he stepped onto the 
parade route, saw a group of people

running toward him in the wrong direc-
tion, shouting: Shots fired, shots fired. 
Instinctively, as the marine and long-
time law enforcement officer that he 
is, he ran the other direction, toward 
the gunshots, unarmed. 
Sheriff Idleburg remembers seeing a 
lot of blood on the sidewalks and street 
when they arrived at the corner of Cen-
tral and Second. He immediately, with 
the assistance of another officer, or-
dered all available resources to the 
scene. 
As he watched victims being at-
tended to, he noticed a woman on her 
stomach with blood coming from her 
back. Sheriff Idleburg immediately 
began to apply pressure to her wound 
with gauze that was provided by an 
emergency worker. As he applied the 
pressure, the sheriff comforted the 
woman. ‘‘I am here for you,’’ he said. ‘‘I 
am not going anywhere,’’ he told her. 
He stayed with that woman for 30 
minutes as they waited for an ambu-
lance while her husband coordinated 
care of her daughter who they had 
brought along. 
These are the stories of my commu-
nity, of my friends. I mentioned the po-
lice and fire departments. I mentioned 
that the police or the fire department 
transported 24 patients, administered 
CPR, and applied tourniquets. The po-
lice, who were also a part of the pa-
rade, were there in the blink of an eye. 
Without hesitation, relying on their 
training and instinct, they imme-
diately responded to the needs of our 
community. 
An incredible story is Highland Park 
Officer Ginger Stokes. Officer Stokes 
had been with the police department 
since 1997, working in the Juvenile In-
vestigation Unit, the Patrol Division, 
the Crisis Intervention Team. 
b 1545 
During the attack, Officer Stokes 
had in her car—in addition to her vest 
she wears every day that would not 
stop a rifle round, she grabbed her 
rifle-rated vest, a second vest. 
As she saw the injured, she saw one 
in particular, an injured woman, she 
took off that rifle-rated vest and put it 
over the woman. Then, despite not hav-
ing that protective vest, she ran back 
into the line of fire. 
Officer Stokes’ astounding heroism, 
Commander Gerry Cameron’s astound-
ing heroism, in fact, the heroism of all 
the first responders, police and fire, in 
Highland Park, is nothing short of 
amazing. 
There are no words I or the commu-
nity can fully express to convey the ap-
preciation and gratitude we have for 
them. Without the immense work 
taken on by first responders that day, 
I fear that the tragedy could have been 
far, far worse. 
The first responders and the civilians 
who went to help, I thank and praise 
all of these people and am grateful for 
them, and I pray for their well-being. I 
ask you to keep them in your prayers 
as well. 
Our community is in pain as we 
think about the loss we have experi-
enced, the members of our community 
who are gone. Our first responders 
share that grief with us. 
The pace of their work doesn’t slow 
down. In fact, for an entire week, the 
blocks 
around 
the 
shooting 
were 
cordoned off as a crime scene. The po-
lice were searching the area, collecting 
evidence. Other police officers were 
making sure that it stayed secure, pro-
tecting the area. 
If you looked at the police cars or the 
names on the police cars, it didn’t say 
Highland Park. It said Glencoe, Deer-
field, Niles, Morton Grove, Prospect 
Heights, and so many more because 
first responders from the entire area 
around Highland Park came to help us. 
It wasn’t just in the days after, keep-
ing the area safe and secure; it was at 
the immediate time of the event. First 
responders from around our commu-
nity as well as the State Police and 
Federal agencies, FBI, ATF, all de-
scended immediately onto Highland 
Park. 
I had a chance later in the day to see 
the command center where they were 
focused. 
With 
incredible 
profes-
sionalism, incredible focus, and amaz-
ingly swift action, they identified the 
shooter, located the shooter, and ap-
prehended him. If not for all these peo-
ple, their work, their diligence, their 
professionalism, 
their 
excellence, 
I 
don’t know that the shooter would be 
captured today. 
Following the shooting, the commu-
nity has united in an extraordinary 
way. Others have come to help. 
This is my community. These were 
my neighbors. All of the people at the 
parade who experienced this shooting, 
who will be forever affected by this 
shooting, are the people I live with and 
I see every day. 
I know their grief, their struggle, 
their anger, and that is one of the rea-
sons why I am so grateful for all of the 
people from areas around who have 
come to support us. 
One example is at the high school. 
They set up a response center to pro-
vide counseling services for anybody 
who might need it. I believe there are 
800 counselors that have come already 
to the high school to talk to residents, 
anyone who stops by. 
Already, in just a matter of 10 days, 
more than 3,000 people have received 
comfort and counsel, trying to get 
through a very difficult time. 
There are other stories. After the 
shooting, as the police gathered and 
the first responders, food trucks start-
ed serving meals to the responders for 
free. Soon, customers made donations 
to cover the costs of those meals. A 
generous family called the owners of 
the food truck and said they would pay 
for every meal provided to first re-
sponders on Friday. 
Highland Park is strong. Highland 
Park will get through this time, in no 
small part because of the care, love, 
and 
compassion 
expressed 
by 
our 
friends and neighbors. 
We will lean on each other. We will 
lift each other up. We couldn’t do it 
without the love that came into our 
community. But as Rabbi Wendi Geffen 
said at the funeral for Jacki Sundheim, 
we shouldn’t have to be here. We 
shouldn’t have to be here. 
No one should be able to get a weap-
on of war, a gun designed for one pur-
pose, to kill human beings with ex-
treme efficiency, ultimate devastation, 
to kill others as quickly and rapidly as 
possible. 
I hope that no one ever has to come 
back to this podium and share stories 
of a mass shooting in their community 
like I have today, like what we saw in 
Uvalde or in Buffalo. That is why I 
have called for a ban on assault weap-
ons. 
Gun violence is a scourge in our 
country that takes many forms. Every 
day, 111 people die from gun violence, 
whether from shootings in the street, 
gang violence, or domestic violence. 
Two-thirds of the deaths by gun vio-
lence in this country are suicides. 
There are far too many accidental 
shootings, of guns left carelessly on a 
coffee table or some other accident 
that would be so easy to avoid. 
I hope my colleagues will work to try 
to reduce the gun violence we have in 
this country, which is unlike anything 
in any other country in the world. 
But today, today, I stand to honor 
the memories and lives of the loved 
ones we lost, people who truly were the 
center of the universe for their families 
and pillars of strength in their commu-
nity; to honor people like Bobby Sha-
piro, Sheriff Idleburg, Officer Stokes, 
Commander Cameron, and it is moving 
to hear the stories of so many others. 
I express my sincerest thanks to all 
those who played a role in saving lives 
on July 4, but also thanks to the many 
people who have spoken up and shared 
their stories, people at the vigils in 
churches and synagogues in Highland 
Park, at Sunset Park. 
On Wednesday night, people gathered 
together in a moment of silence—as we 
did here in this very body at the same 
time—at City Hall in Highland Park. 
The people who came to Washington 
with March Fourth, a group that, on 
Wednesday, rallied for changes in our 
gun laws to make a difference in lives 
and fight to make sure no other com-
munity experiences what we have in 
Highland Park, in Uvalde, Buffalo, El 
Paso, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Orlando, 
Denver. The list just goes on and on. 
We can’t wait any longer to take 
meaningful action on this violence. Our 
grandkids can’t afford to wait. Our 
kids shouldn’t be made to wait. Our en-
tire country deserves better. 
Madam Speaker, I close by saying 
this: The last 11 days have been incred-
ibly painful for my community. High-
land Park will recover. We have experi-
enced something that no other commu-
nity should ever experience and too 
many communities suffer from each 
and every day. 
It breaks my heart to realize that in 
all likelihood, I will not be the last

Member of Congress giving this speech. 
It is possible—it is possible—that, in 
fact, this may not be the last time I 
have to give a speech like this. 
Enough is enough. I hope the Mem-
bers of this body will find the courage 
to take action and save lives. Let’s 
start by getting the assault weapons 
ban in place, these military weapons of 
war designed to kill and devastate off 
our streets. 
Let’s always honor the memory of 
those who should be with us here today 
but were murdered in the primes of 
their lives. May their memories and 
the memories of all lost to gun vio-
lence forever be a blessing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
INFLATION IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Thank 
you, 
Madam Speaker. I am going to yield to 
my friend from Florida, the sheriff, 
such time as he may consume. 
WAR ON AFFORDABLE ENERGY 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this week’s Con-
sumer Price Index report indicates that 
we just reached a 40-year high in June. 
This kind of inflation is a tax on every 
American and a threat to our middle- 
class families. 
As a result of Democrats’ reckless, 
trillion-dollar inflationary spending, 
hardworking Americans are taking a 
pay cut, and failed relief plans have 
caused unprecedented financial chal-
lenges to the U.S. economy, hitting the 
American taxpayers the hardest. 
Some of my friends on the other side 
of the aisle blame the inflation on the 
war in Ukraine, but Americans faced 
sharp, rising inflation long before Rus-
sia invaded Ukraine. 
Now, 
additional 
price 
increases 
across the board continue to eat away 
at the paychecks of this Nation’s work-
force, making it even harder to achieve 
the American Dream for millions of 
Americans. 
I am sure many of my colleagues can 
relate when I say I have conversations 
back home with folks who are strug-
gling to afford everyday essentials, in-
cluding baby formula and fuel, that 
continue to be in short supply. 
President Biden and the Democrats’ 
lack of concrete solutions are falling 
short. The President’s first action upon 
taking office was to end construction 
of the Keystone XL pipeline and issue a 
moratorium on new oil and gas permits 
on Federal lands. 
His most recent efforts to court oil 
deals with our hostile counterparts in 
Saudi Arabia are futile. In fact, it was 
embarrassing today. 
Increasing America’s energy inde-
pendence is the best way to alleviate 
the pressure Americans feel at the gas 
pump. This means producing more 
American energy, not less. Restoring 
American energy production here at 
home will make our country more 
prosperous and secure while lowering 
the price at the gas pump. 
I recently cosponsored the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act 
which would reopen the Keystone XL 
pipeline, increase our natural gas pro-
duction and exports, encourage energy 
and mineral development on foreign 
lands, and prevent needless regulation 
on domestic oil and gas production. 
However, those across the aisle have 
consistently blocked this legislation 
for a total of seven times. Seven times. 
This war on affordable energy pro-
duction is the main culprit for both the 
high gas prices and skyrocketing food 
prices. Given the current economic cli-
mate, it is critical that Congress thor-
oughly consider how legislation will 
contribute to future inflation. 
For this reason, I cosponsored the In-
formed Lawmaking to Combat Infla-
tion Act. This would require the Con-
gressional Budget Office to provide an 
inflation estimate for major pieces of 
legislation so that Members of Con-
gress can be best informed about how 
these spending bills will impact infla-
tion. 
I also supported the implementation 
of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which 
lowered tax rates for all Americans and 
simplified our tax code. We must con-
tinue efforts to lower taxes, not raise 
taxes, especially at a time like this. 
b 1600 
We should take this opportunity to 
make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax 
cuts permanent. The President’s infla-
tion crisis is already costing the Amer-
ican U.S. household $6,000 as they en-
counter the skyrocketing cost of goods. 
The American people deserve com-
monsense solutions that will help ease 
the economic burden. Future genera-
tions of Americans depend on the fi-
nancial decisions made today. I will 
keep fighting for real relief for hard-
working Americans and am focused on 
legislation that supports the middle 
class and allows hardworking Florid-
ians and others to keep more of their 
paychecks, allowing families to better 
save for college, invest in their retire-
ment, and spend more time with their 
loved ones. 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
I 
thank 
my 
friend from Florida. 
Madam Speaker, we are going to try 
to do the rapid boards and try to show 
some data of what is going on out 
there. 
What I am going to do is going to be 
a little harsh, but I need to beg the ma-
jority to think about the information. 
The data we are going to show may 
just prove, please, you have got to stop 
what you are doing. You are hurting 
people. The cascade may already be 
built in. We may now have years of 
really ugly, really bad, hurtful, cruel 
built into the economy. 
Now, look, part of my premise is that 
good policy is not only good for the 
United States, it is good for the world, 
it is good for growth, it is good for the 
future, it is good for poverty, it closes 
income inequality. 
You actually go back to after the 
2017 tax reform. The Democrats came 
to these mikes and said: Oh, the world 
is coming to an end; there is going to 
be a recession. None of it was true, and 
they knew it wasn’t true even though 
an economist said it wasn’t true. You 
had some of the greatest growth in 
U.S. history, some of the fastest clos-
ing of income inequality, the poor got 
dramatically less poor, but you also 
saw GDP around the world got better. 
Look, when I am holding articles like 
this about how many may die this com-
ing fall because of food shortages, that 
is not the Democrats, but the Demo-
crats’ inaction is their fault. They run 
this place. They run the House, they 
run the Senate, they run the White 
House. Instead, the White House, along 
with the Democrats here, decide hey, 
let’s burn some more ethanol by taking 
our food, our grain supply, and instead 
of doing the rotation, saying we need 
to stop this, we need to turn that into 
animal feed, you know, there is a fer-
tilizer shortage, let’s grow soybeans, 
the things to get prepared. They were 
so worried about their next election. 
The idiocy of this place is they were 
willing to sacrifice people around the 
world. That is the cruelty that con-
tinues to be Democrat policy. 
Let’s actually sort of walk through 
what Democrats are doing to Ameri-
cans. When I am holding boards with 
quotes from Jason Furman, something 
is wrong in the world. 
‘‘The decline in real average hourly 
earnings at this point is terrible, the 
fastest pace of decline in 40 years.’’ 
What is Jason Furman saying? 
He is basically saying people are get-
ting poorer every single day. 
The Democrats have owned this place 
now for, what, 16 months? You have got 
16 months functionally of people being 
poorer every single day. 
But what does that mean? 
You have Republican after Repub-
lican. You notice the Democrats al-
most never want to talk about what 
they have set off. We bring boards like 
this, and we say: Hey, do you realize 
your eggs are 33 percent more expen-
sive? Nondurable goods, if you take the 
whole category, there was a number a 
couple days ago, the inflation number 
that was almost in the 30s on non-
durable goods for that monthly snap-
shot. 
But I need you to think much more 
grand in understanding inflation. Infla-
tion is a lot more than you are paying 
21 percent more for your butter. I need 
you 
to 
understand 
what 
inflation 
means to you and your family’s sur-
vival and the cruelty of this place not 
giving a damn, the cruelty of this place 
being unwilling to actually do real leg-
islation that would help. 
They basically have decided: Oh, we 
are going to pretend it is the Fed’s 
fault, it is Russia’s fault, and this place

isn’t going to do anything. We are 
going to let the Federal Reserve jack 
up interest rates to the point where 
they put lots of people out of work, 
have that misery, and somehow Demo-
crats think they are not going to be 
held responsible for what they have 
done? 
I was trying to come up with a way 
to help someone understand what infla-
tion really means to your life. Well, 
this is a snapshot of the Democrats’ 
congressional calendar. I represent the 
Scottsdale-Phoenix area, highest infla-
tion in the continental United States. 
If you are a worker in my area and you 
haven’t had a pay raise, but you still 
actually do things like eat, drive, live 
in shelter, do you understand how 
many days you are now working for 
free? 
You need to think this through. You 
work so many days, but take a look 
down here, you functionally have lost 
almost 2 months of labor just for the 
inflation from the last 16 months. 
Think about that. If I came to you 
right now and said, Hey, guess what? 
You are going to lose 41 days of your 
labor. You are going to work for the 
government. Actually, you are going to 
work for the government for free. Be-
cause what is the great scam? Where 
did this money actually go? 
I need you to conceptualize the value 
of your time that has been stripped 
from you. It didn’t just disappear. That 
value functionally went to debt. It low-
ered the value of debt by raising your 
own costs. So you have actually sort of 
transferred a bunch of your wealth to 
the U.S. sovereign debt. It is a little 
ethereal to process, but that is func-
tionally what happened. 
So the trillions and trillions and tril-
lions and trillions of dollars of debt 
this place has piled up, the Democrats 
found a way to tax you. They basically 
set off inflation. They took away a cou-
ple months, a couple months of your 
labor, and then functionally trans-
ferred it so that will pay back these 
trillions and trillions and trillions of 
dollars of debt but will pay it back 
with dollars that are worth less. 
Do you see the picture? Maybe that 
is the real reason the left here isn’t on 
fire trying to save people from this 
misery. 
And it is dead serious. You can do the 
June 2021 or since December. If you do 
December, particularly for my Phoenix 
area—and I am the highest inflation in 
the continental United States. For the 
entire country, apparently urban Alas-
ka—who ever knew that was a sub-
category economic zone?—is slightly 
higher than us. 
But if you go back to since December 
2020, you have lost 1.9 months of your 
labor. The reason I am trying to chart 
it this way is people go, Oh, eggs are 
only 20 percent more, how many eggs 
are you going to eat? I need you to 
think about this, of how many days 
you are working not to feed your fam-
ily anymore, not to pay your mortgage 
or your rent. You are basically giving 
it away. It has been ripped; it has been 
stripped away from you. And you start 
to think about that. 
If you go since June 2021, you have 
lost 40 days of work that has been 
stripped away from you, the value. You 
worked for 40 days for free now. If you 
go back to December 2020, you now 
worked for 57 days. If you live in the 
Phoenix area, our inflation has been so 
high you worked for 57 days for free. 
This is what Democrat policies did to 
you. Tell me this isn’t cruel. 
Do you understand what this does to 
the working poor? We get this great 
speechifying here; the virtue signaling 
is great. But somehow Democrats get 
judged on pretty words, and we get 
judged on what we accomplish. 
Look at what we accomplished after 
refining, fixing, reforming the tax 
code. 
Look what we did economically for 
the working poor when we fixed the 
regulatory code. 
Look at the misery. Look at the mis-
ery you have set off. 
How many presentations here, how 
many pieces of legislation have come 
to the floor? Those of us in the Ways 
and Means Committee, Republicans, we 
keep offering ideas and saying, We will 
do this in partnership with you. There 
are things we can do legislatively to 
help take on inflation. We could no 
more get one of our amendments heard 
around here because it is being con-
trolled out of NANCY PELOSI’s office. 
If you start taking a look at what in-
flation has done to my community— 
and I know this chart is noisy and 
there is a lot of movement on it, but 
you start looking at the median price 
of a home. Remember, when we talk 
about housing, you get knifed in two 
different directions. The price of the 
house goes way up, but the value of 
your savings that you have been saving 
up to buy that house goes down, so you 
get it on both sides of the seesaw. 
You wonder why housing insecurity 
is just skyrocketing in this country. 
Once again, great speeches. Maybe we 
will throw a bunch more government 
money at it, but those are their poli-
cies that have made people’s lives mis-
erable. 
This chart, you see that line that 
just collapses? That is the value of 
your hourly earnings. You may be 
being paid more. Great. Hey, I got a 5 
percent pay raise. But in the Phoenix 
area, CPI-U went up, what, 13.1? Tradi-
tional CPI went up 12.1. Great, you got 
a 5 percent pay raise. Where are the 
other 7 points? You functionally are 7 
percent poorer every day. 
These are more than just charts. 
These are people. These are people just 
trying to find a way to air-condition 
their house, pay for the gas to get to 
work, to feed the family. 
I understand I often come behind this 
microphone and hold my boards up and 
sound like an accountant on steroids. 
But these are people, and your country 
is poorer, substantially poorer today. 
All the progress we made after the 2017 
reforms on the tax code, which created 
the miracle of economic growth and 
closing income inequality. The poor 
got less poor. They succeeded in strip-
ping it all away. It is all gone. The 
thousands and thousands and thou-
sands of dollars of increased purchasing 
power for the working middle class, it 
is all gone. 
The 
left’s 
policies 
are 
basically 
arsonists to this country’s prosperity. 
And yet the brilliant policies of what 
they did a year ago when they pushed 
out another $1.9 trillion and required 
no work, asked for no work, asked for 
no job training. They just gave away 
money. And now we can’t figure out 
why we can’t get the population back 
into the labor force. 
How do you think we are going to get 
productivity back? 
How do you think we are ever going 
to get inflation back under control? 
If inflation is too many dollars chas-
ing too few goods and services, guess 
what? You can do two things: you can 
have the Federal Reserve jack up inter-
est rates and crash the economy, and 
that seems to be the Democrat play-
book, just put people out of work, let’s 
just push up misery. 
Or we could get together in this place 
and find ways to help people, make our 
society, make business more produc-
tive. Help people have an incentive to 
take some of that cash and instead of 
going to buy a new television, put it 
aside for their future retirement. There 
are things we could do. 
The policies that would get our 
brothers and sisters back in the labor 
force are absolutely key. 
Do you think as Republicans we 
could ever get a Democrat to let us 
have a simple amendment, even though 
some of the ideas were ones we agreed 
upon a year ago? 
It was a Republican-Democrat idea, 
but, today, oh God, we can’t let the Re-
publicans 
actually 
have 
something 
that might be good for society and ac-
tually may help knock down inflation 
because it encourages people back into 
the labor force, and therefore we could 
pump up productivity and therefore we 
have more goods and services to chew 
up the massive currency that the 
Democrats handed out from this place. 
When I talk about the misery, it is 
not a snapshot, if I get one more 
idiot—and I am sorry, that is mean, 
and I probably broke decorum there. 
But if I get one more person who didn’t 
show up at their basic economics class 
come behind these microphones and 
say, Well, it is transitory. No, it is not. 
b 1615 
You have got to understand what is 
going on right now is these inflation 
numbers 
are 
becoming 
structural, 
meaning this misery is built into the 
next decade of your life. 
When you see a chart like this, you 
start to understand the CPI and then 
the medical expenses. So you may be 
over here and then you come along, hit 
2022, and you start to understand: How

are you going to afford your healthcare 
in the future? 
Is the Democrats’ goal: We will just 
subsidize it more? 
I am going to show you a slide that 
the Democrats’ approach is saying: 
Let’s just give away more money. We 
will cover up our sins by giving away 
more money. 
It turns out, we have now some great 
studies that say: As they pile up the 
debt, it also makes your life miserable 
and slows down your economic growth 
and slows down prosperity in society. 
This is one we just came across, and 
it is a GAO study. You have got to un-
derstand what the left’s policies are 
doing. 
We need to create a whole new mis-
ery index. Forty years ago when Ron-
ald Reagan was running against Jimmy 
Carter and they had high inflation and 
high unemployment, he created this 
misery index. It was just a way for peo-
ple to understand the brutality the 
left’s policies were doing to people’s 
lives. Maybe we need to create new 
one. 
Because this is a really weird cycle. 
We have high employment. We have a 
demographic bubble that goes against 
us. We are getting old very fast as a so-
ciety. We have incentivized, we have fi-
nanced people not to participate in the 
labor force, and we have handed out 
lots of free money that had no attach-
ment to labor. Then you start to find 
out that GAO’s own study basically 
was looking at homelessness. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, we had a 
number of the Democrats that were 
giving beautiful speeches about how 
much they care about homelessness. I 
have ZIP Codes in my community 
where homelessness has doubled in the 
last year. There are some real problems 
in areas of Phoenix. 
What happens if I come to you and 
say, a $100 increase in median rents 
was associated with a 9 percent in-
crease in the estimated homelessness 
rate? 
So what they are basically saying— 
and this is a GAO study—as rents go 
up, particularly in those sort of ‘‘C 
apartments,’’ or those basic living 
places—as those rents go up, for every 
$100, their study was finding another 9 
percent increase in people displaced 
from housing. 
Once again, the Democrats’ solution 
will be, well, let’s subsidize them, let’s 
give out some more money, let’s not do 
the things necessary to flatten out so 
we have economic stability in our soci-
ety. 
The homelessness, let alone what is 
going on on the border in my State and 
the fentanyl in my neighborhoods, also 
turns out our instinct was right—we 
found the study—that the inflation the 
left has set off is now making people 
displaced from their housing. They are 
living in alleys in my neighborhoods. 
You start to look at the other misery 
index that they have brought to my 
community, the fentanyl. You have got 
to understand the amount of fentanyl 
that is pouring across my border. I 
have already done presentations on 
this. It is partially anecdotal because I 
don’t think there is actually a public 
exchange. But when I have Phoenix po-
lice sergeants telling me that it is 
down to like $12 to get high for the day 
on fentanyl where a year ago it was 
over $100, does that tell you there is 
something really wrong on the border? 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STANSBURY). The gentleman has 61⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
then you start to understand the other 
policies we are going to pay for, for 
decades. 
Don’t laugh. I have a little girl who 
is about to turn 7. Out of nowhere, my 
wife and I now have a little boy that is 
functionally 18 days old, one of the 
greatest gifts God has ever given us. 
But I look at my little girl and I look 
at these other children that are first 
graders or second graders, and we are 
seeing some terrifying data on what 
the left’s policy of locking down 
schools and—‘‘you are going to do it 
through a computer screen’’—are we 
prepared for the data we are already 
seeing on what is happening on stand-
ardized math scores around the coun-
try? 
You do realize—this is, once again, 
like the inflation—it is a cascade effect 
that we will live with through the next 
decade, unless we sort of step in and fix 
this. This is a derivative of Democrat 
policies, when you start to see stand-
ardized math test scores suffering all 
across the country, particularly in 
those States and communities that en-
gaged 
in 
the 
almost 
excessive 
lockdowns for theater. It was virtue 
signaling. The math never said it. 
This is a fascinating one. Growing 
debt would result in a per-person in-
come being lowered, functionally $9,000 
lower, or a 10 percent reduction. What 
this study is trying to do is trying to 
understand—as the left basically says: 
Our solution is we are going to send 
someone money. What does it function-
ally do to future prosperity when you 
start to actually see what this does in 
future purchasing power for your in-
come? 
Now, it is a complicated formula. 
Part of it basically says you don’t have 
as much capital revolving in the econ-
omy, so you don’t have much invest-
ment in productivity, so the society 
doesn’t get healthier, wealthier, better, 
or faster, because all of that cash is 
functionally financing U.S. sovereign 
debt. But are you prepared? Because 
this is what the left has brought you. 
As the debt skyrockets, you get to live 
about 10 percent poorer. 
Now, stack that on the fact that you 
have lost a couple months of your 
labor. Tell me I am not wrong to be 
angry about the cruelty and the com-
plete avoidance of the misery this 
place is creating across the country. 
And then you start to look at where 
our future is. Remember, eventually 
the math wins. The pretty words here 
may get you reelected, but the math 
will always win. 
This is where we are at. And you 
start to look at what is going on. The 
interest—because the piling up of debt, 
Social Security, Medicare, interest is 
now functionally crossing, in the next 
few years, across all defense spending 
and all Medicaid spending. 
You understand, this is Social Secu-
rity, this is Medicare, this is interest. 
A number of my friends on the left say: 
‘‘Well, if we cut defense.’’ The green 
line is defense. 
I know you may care more about this 
coming election, but we have got to 
stop the misery. 
Just minutes ago, the Atlanta Fed’s 
GDP calculator just announced that 
the second quarter looks like it wasn’t 
1.2 percent negative; it is 11⁄2 percent 
negative. Remember your high school 
economic class? Even though it is not 
technically correct, congratulations, 
you brought us 2 months of negative 
GDP. 
Please, to the majority, stop hurting 
people. Let some of us—I will give you 
the ideas. Put your own name on them. 
We are better than this. It can’t be 
all about the next election. If we don’t 
stop this, we are about to get a decade 
of misery because of crappy decisions 
made in the last 16 months. That is 
just not fair. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
WILL WOODWORTH TO THE PEO-
PLE OF MAINE 
HON. JARED F. GOLDEN 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a member of my staff, Will 
Woodworth, as he prepares to depart Capitol 
Hill after nearly ten years of service to take a 
position at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. 
Will hails from Yarmouth, Maine and has 
been working on behalf of the people of our 
state for the better part of the last decade. He 
first entered Maine politics after graduating 
from college, joining the staff of then-Governor 
Angus King in his run for the U.S. Senate in 
2012. He then joined Senator King’s staff in 
Washington, handling constituent correspond-
ence and advising the senator on issues like 
broadband and technology. 
In 2019, my office was lucky enough to con-
vince Will to abandon the comforts of the Sen-
ate for the more rough-and-tumble nature of 
the House. In joining my team, Will took on a 
senior policy role, advising me on a wide 
range of issues, from my work on the House 
Small Business Committee to healthcare and 
economic policy. Despite the often insur-
mountable volume of work, Will has been a 
steady, dedicated, and thoughtful staffer who 
has helped me execute on key legislative pri-
orities while also doing the time-intensive work 
of directly helping constituents across Maine’s 
Second District understand my positions on 
policy issues and helping solve the problems 
they have faced with federal agencies. 
People like Will are what make this place 
run, and he represents the best of public serv-
ice—quietly and steadily keeping the wheels 
of government working and never seeking at-
tention or accolades for his efforts. Mainers 
have been fortunate to have had Will 
Woodworth on their side in Washington, as 
have I. We all wish him the very best on this 
next professional adventure and give him our 
profound thanks for his service to Maine and 
the country.

RECOGNIZING BILL HALE’S 
SERVICE TO TXDOT 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Bill Hale as he retires 
from public service. Throughout his nearly four 
decades with the Texas Department of Trans-
portation (TxDOT), he has been highly re-
garded for his leadership and innovation on 
concession and design-build projects within 
the State of Texas. He oversaw many crucial 
initiatives, including the LBJ Express project 
and the Clear Lanes program. 
After graduating from Samuel High School 
in south Dallas, Hale entered the University of 
Texas at Arlington. He earned both his bach-
elor’s and master’s degrees in civil engineer-
ing on that same campus. Hale began at 
TxDOT in the Ellis County Area Office in 
1983. He went on to become the Ellis County 
assistant area engineer and was appointed 
the Southeast Dallas County Area Engineer 
(AE) in 1992. One of Hale’s most significant 
milestones as the county’s AE was the build-
ing of TxDOT’s first movable barrier high-oc-
cupancy vehicle lane on Interstate 30. In 
1999, Hale’s work earned him the title of Abi-
lene District Engineer (DE), and in late 2003, 
he was promoted to the post of Dallas DE. In 
late 2014, he was appointed Chief Engineer. 
During his tenure as TxDOT’s Chief Engi-
neer, Hale has been responsible for the man-
agement and control of the Bridge, Construc-
tion, Design, Maintenance, Traffic Opps and 
Right of Way divisions as well as the Local 
Government Projects office. He has managed 
the construction of the Margaret Hunt Hill and 
Margaret McDermott bridges, two cable-stay 
structures that define the Dallas skyline. He 
also oversaw the building of Texas’ first deck 
park and led TxDOT’s evaluation of a private- 
sector proposal to expand State Highway 121. 
Hale’s work on both the LBJ Express project 
and the Clear Lanes program led to significant 
congestion relief in North Texas’ five largest 
neighborhoods. In addition to his construction 
efforts, Hale launched the TxDOT Connect 
web-based project information program, which 
became incredibly vital to the department’s op-
eration. 
Hale is a ‘‘civil engineer’s engineer’’: a hard- 
working professional. Those colleagues who 
worked with him on the projects he spear-
headed both respect and admire him. He’s 
been instrumental in how every major trans-
portation project in the metropolitan areas in 
the State of Texas have taken shape. Hale’s 
effective leadership and networking capabili-
ties have been critical in bringing together 
public and private sectors and affected com-
munities to move necessary transportation 
projects forward. 
My office has been privileged to have a con-
genial working relationship with Hale over the 
past two decades, and his experienced input 
and support of our joint annual Transportation 
Summits contributed highly to our success in 
educating local elected officials on upcoming 
transportation 
projects 
affecting 
Denton, 
Tarrant and other North Texas counties. I am 
thankful for Bill Hale’s 39-year career in public 
service, and I wish him all the best in his re-
tirement. 
RECOGNIZING JON JAY FOR HIS 
IMPECCABLE 
12-YEAR 
MAJOR 
LEAGUE BASEBALL CAREER 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jon Jay, who recently re-
tired after an impeccable 12-year Major 
League Baseball career. Jon’s hard work and 
dedication led him to win a World Series 
Championship in 2011 with the St. Louis Car-
dinals. 
Born in Miami, and a true product of the 
baseball fields of South Florida, Jon helped 
lead Christopher Columbus High School to its 
first baseball state title in 2003. He then went 
on to have a Hall of Fame career at the Uni-
versity of Miami. Jon finished his Major 
League Baseball career with an impressive 
.283 batting average, and—remarkably—with 
the highest fielding percentage among all out-
fielders in baseball history. 
Jon has never lost sight of his roots as a 
proud Cuban-American, whose family history 
is engrained in public service and patriotism. 
His great-grandfather, Justo Salas, was the 
first Afro-Cuban mayor of Santiago de Cuba, 
and the first Afro-Cuban governor of Oriente 
Province. Jon’s grandfather, Enrique Tulio Jay, 
was a political prisoner in Fidel Castro’s dun-
geons for 19 long years. 
After 12 years in Major League Baseball, 
Jon credits his loving family and their tireless 
support for all his success. I also want to con-
gratulate Jon’s wife, Nikki, and their beautiful 
children: Brooklyn, Berkley, and Jaxon, for this 
remarkable achievement. The life of a Major 
League wife and family is not always easy, 
and I applaud their steadfast devotion to Jon 
and his career. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to con-
gratulate Jon Jay on an amazing baseball ca-
reer and for his continuous dedication to rep-
resenting his community—not just in South 
Florida, but across the country. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing this out-
standing individual.

NATIONAL 
CONVENTION 
OF 
LAMBDA THETA PHI IN TAMPA, 
FLORIDA 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and extend my congratulations to 
Lambda Theta Phi on their 2022 National 
Convention, and I commend them on their de-
cision to host this year’s convention in the city 
of Tampa, which is just across the Bay from 
my home district of Pinellas County in the 
great state of Florida. 
Since its founding in 1975, Lambda Theta 
Phi has undertaken many laudable initiatives, 
such as fundraising for victims of natural dis-
asters and helping those struggling with home-
lessness get back on their feet. In doing so, 
they have demonstrated their enduring com-
mitment to the lofty ideals laid out by the Fra-
ternal Fathers, Dr. Cayetano Socarra´s and Dr. 
Jose´ Quiles, including academic excellence, 
service, leadership, and Latino unity. 
As a lifelong Florida resident, former Gov-
ernor, and proud Representative of Florida’s 
13th Congressional District, I have seen the 
power of these ideals in action. From their 
close partnership with the Congressional His-
panic Caucus Institute, to the dozens of Lamb-
da Theta Phi brothers in Washington, Talla-
hassee, and across Florida working tirelessly 
for a better future, Lambda Theta Phi brothers 
truly represent the best of our communities. 
It is with great pleasure that I congratulate 
this historic organization on their continued na-
tional engagement through this convention, 
and extend my best wishes to them in all their 
future endeavors. Finally, I echo the chant that 
has united Latino brothers in fraternity and a 
shared mission for almost 50 years—Lambda 
Theta Phi, Lambda ’till the day we die. 
TRIBUTE TO THE ROSE BOWL 
STADIUM 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the centennial anniversary of the 
Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. 
On January 1, 1890, in celebration of the 
balmy California winter weather, the Valley 
Hunt Club organized a parade with floats, 
flowers, and equestrian displays. This celebra-
tion would come to be known as the Rose Pa-
rade and would grow to such popularity that a 
separate organization, the Tournament of 
Roses Association, was created to facilitate its 
annual planning and operation. In 1902, a 
football game was created to finance the cost 
of the parade. It was called the ‘‘Tournament 
East-West football game,’’ with the University 
of Michigan defeating Stanford University 49– 
0. This would later be renamed the ‘‘Rose 
Bowl Game,’’ and nicknamed ‘‘The Grandaddy 
of Them All’’—the oldest currently operating 
bowl game. 
By 1922, the parade had outgrown its 
former venue of Tournament Park and con-
struction began on a new stadium, designed 
by notable architect Myron Hunt who had 
been inspired by the design of the Yale Bowl 
in Connecticut. Over the decades, many addi-
tions and refurbishments have been carried 
out ranging from an entire new southern wing 
of stands, which turned the stadium from a 
horseshoe into an actual bowl, to over seventy 
thousand new seat backs. The stadium is now 
recognized as a National Historic Landmark 
and a California Historic Civil Engineering 
Landmark. 
The first game at the stadium was in 1922 
between the University of California, Berkeley 
and the University of Southern California 
(USC), ending in a Berkeley victory. The sta-
dium was officially dedicated on January 1, 
1923, with a game between USC and Penn-
sylvania State University that ended in a USC 
victory. Since then, the Rose Bowl has been 
home to numerous historic achievements in 
the world of sports and entertainment, such as 
the first transcontinental radio broadcast of a 
sporting event in 1927 and the first national 
color telecast of a college football game in 
1962. 
Today, the Rose Bowl Stadium hosts the 
annual Rose Bowl Game. It also has hosted 
the University of California, Los Angeles Bru-
ins home games since 1982 and five Super 
Bowls. Beyond football, the stadium has 
served as the venue for the 1994 FIFA World 
Cup Final, the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup 
Final, and participated in two Olympic Games. 
It will host events for the 2028 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games, and this past Independ-
ence Day, hosted its 96th Annual Americafest 
Fireworks Show on July 4, 2022. Notable ce-
lebrities such as Whitney Houston, Beyonce´, 
Jennifer Lopez, Justin Timberlake and Taylor 
Swift have all performed at the venue, as well 
as many world-renowned bands, such as The 
Rolling 
Stones, 
Journey, 
The 
Eagles, 
Coldplay, and BTS. 
I consider it a great privilege to recognize 
the Rose Bowl Stadium upon its one-hun-
dredth anniversary, and I ask all Members to 
join me in congratulating this venerable, his-
toric stadium. 
SUPPORTING A WOMAN’S RIGHT 
TO CHOOSE 
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
unwavering support of legislation that protects 
a woman’s right to make her own decisions 
regarding her own body. This includes H.R. 
8296, the Women’s Health Protection Act of 
2022, and H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to 
Abortion Act of 2022. Women should have the 
right to make their own health care decisions; 
a right that was stripped away with the Su-
preme Court’s decision to ignore almost fifty 
years of precedent and overturn Roe v. Wade. 
In my home state of Michigan, a draconian 
1931 abortion ban—with no exceptions for 
rape or incest—is only held back by a prelimi-
nary injunction. If the ninety-one-year-old law 
goes into effect, millions of Michiganders will 
lose their reproductive freedom. I’ve said it 
once before, and I will say it again, abortion 
bans don’t ban abortions, they ban safe abor-
tions. 
The right to bodily autonomy, privacy, and 
even travel is at stake. Passing these two 
pieces of legislation is a critical step toward 
protecting the constitutional rights of millions 
of Americans. Now more than ever, the Sen-
ate needs to pass both bills so that women 
can make the best healthcare decisions for 
themselves and their families.

RECOGNIZING THE SINGFIELD 
FAMILY OF ALBANY, GEORGIA 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the Singfield family and 
their distinguished contributions to the City of 
Albany, Georgia. On June 27, 2022, Glenn 
Singfield, Sr. and Tandra Singfield, along with 
their sons Glenn II and Gerard Singfield, re-
ceived the Georgia Municipal Association’s 
Renaissance Award, which recognizes those 
who have made significant contributions to the 
revitalization of downtown areas in the state of 
Georgia. The Singfield family became the first 
Albany-area recipients of the Renaissance 
Award, which they received in recognition of 
one of the Good Life City’s favorite res-
taurants, The Flint. 
The Singfield family cut their teeth in the Al-
bany restaurant industry after Glenn II, known 
as ‘‘Deuce,’’ and Gerard witnessed a serious 
car accident on Thanksgiving eve of 2012, 
which led the Singfield brothers to reevaluate 
their career paths. Deuce expressed his desire 
to pursue his lifelong passion for cooking, and 
his family felt called to invest in his talents. 
Two years later, the Singfield family opened 
their first restaurant, The Albany Fish Com-
pany, an outstanding seafood restaurant that 
marked the family’s first success in the res-
taurant industry. 
After seeing the success of the Albany Fish 
Company, the City of Albany approached the 
Singfields and asked them to take part in the 
revitalization of downtown by opening a new

establishment. When the time came to build 
the new restaurant, Glenn Singfield, Sr., a 
building contractor, used a very special blue-
print—a drawing Glenn II had made at age 
twelve illustrating his ‘‘dream restaurant,’’ The 
Flint, which had its grand opening on April 15, 
2019. The Flint is located in the heart of 
downtown Albany in a 10,000 square foot 
building that was once a cotton factory. While 
Glenn Sr. and Tandra are the owners, Gerard, 
until recently, served as the General Manager, 
and Deuce serves as the Head Chef. Deuce’s 
passion and talent have brought to life an ac-
claimed menu, including such unique items as 
the Shrimp and Gator Po Boy and Gavin’s 
Flaming Burger, which bring people from all 
over Southwest Georgia to the restaurant. 
Greater than the appeal of The Flint’s menu 
is the impact the restaurant and the Singfield 
family have had on the Albany-area commu-
nity and local economic development. The 
Flint displays over 200 pieces of art curated 
by local artists, giving its customers a unique 
dining and shopping experience, while allow-
ing local artists a unique marketing opportunity 
to sell their art. Additionally, the Singfields 
have made huge investments into training 
their employees, known by The Flint as ‘‘asso-
ciates,’’ and preparing them for success in 
their future endeavors. However, it is not just 
restaurant associates who receive support 
from the Singfields—every patron of The Flint 
is treated like family from the moment they 
walk through the door. 
Mahatma Gandhi once said that ‘‘the best 
way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the 
service of others.’’ The Singfield family has 
done exactly that. Countless lives across Al-
bany have been touched by the Singfield fam-
ily, carrying the family’s impact far beyond 
their original task of revitalizing the downtown 
Albany area. 
Madam Speaker, today I ask my colleagues 
to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 
more than 730,000 people of Georgia’s Sec-
ond Congressional District, in commending the 
Singfield family for receipt of the well-deserved 
Renaissance Award in recognition of their out-
standing contributions to the Albany, Georgia 
community.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
HORACE EDWIN CRUMP 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to recognize and celebrate the life 
of Mr. Horace Edwin Crump of Montgomery, 
Alabama, who sadly passed away on Friday, 
June 10, 2022. 
After graduating from Thomas A. Levy High 
School, Mr. Crump earned a bachelor’s de-
gree and an Education Specialist degree from 
Alabama State University and went on to be 
an Assistant Professor in Alabama State Uni-
versity’s Department of Health and Physical 
Education. 
Mr. Crump also served as Alabama State 
University’s head track and field coach and 
was inducted into the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference Hall of Fame in 2009. 
Coach Crump worked at Alabama State 
University beginning in 1977 and coached the 
Hornets for thirty-one seasons until his retire-
ment in 2008. During those years, he guided 
his team to fourteen Southwestern Athletic 
Conference championships with at least one 
of his teams winning a conference title for six 
years straight. 
Coach Crump took the program from what it 
had been to unthinkable heights. He threw the 
discus and shot put as a collegian. When he 
became the Hornets’ coach, his goal was to 
have a balanced team that could score points 
in the field events and the running events. 
Coach Crump was preceded in death by his 
parents, Charles and Gertrude Crump; his 
son, Damian Crump; his sister, Marion Dav-
enport; and his brothers, Charles and Harrison 
Crump. 
He leaves behind his beloved wife, Delores 
Crump; his son, Kenneth Crump; his daughter, 
Crystal Crump; his stepsons, CV and Rodney 
Hill; his brother, Donny Crump; and his sister, 
Yolanda McClinton—along with grandchildren, 
great-grandchildren, and nieces and nephews. 
Coach Crump was an upstanding and re-
spected citizen of Alabama’s Second Congres-
sional District that left lifelong impressions on 
his many students and athletes. I am proud to 
rise in honor of his life, and I am confident that 
he will be sorely missed by his family, his 
many friends, and the countless men and 
women he impacted throughout his lifetime of 
service.

PASSAGE 
OF 
THE 
PALLONE- 
PAPPAS 
AMENDMENT 
TO 
H.R. 
7900 IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE 
SALE OF F–16S TO TURKEY 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in great thanks 
for this House’s passage of the Pallone- 
Pappas amendment to the Fiscal Year 2023 
National Defense Authorization Act. I was 
pleased to co-lead this amendment alongside 
Representatives PAPPAS, PALLONE, my fellow 
Hellenic Caucus Co-Chair GUS BILIRAKIS, and 
many others. 
This was the right thing to do. From con-
sistent violations of Greek sovereignty using 
their F–16 fleet, to Turkey’s ongoing and ille-
gal occupation on Cyprus with 40,000 soldiers, 
and growing authoritarian tendencies by Presi-
dent Erdogan, Turkey is not the kind of ally 
that I believe should receive such a sale. 
Further, Turkey still possesses Russian S– 
400 anti-air systems in violation of U.S. law, 
which led to their ejection from the F–35 pro-
gram and the imposition of CAATSA sanc-
tions. We did not go through with that sale be-
cause doing so could expose sensitive tech-
nologies in the F–35 to this Russian system, 
and possibly allow Russia to easily counter 
our improvements; that risk remains even 
when modernizing F–16s. 
Selling Turkey more F–16s or providing 
them with the technology to modernize their 
current fleet would not be in the interest of the 
United States or our allies. I am proud to have 
worked with Representative PAPPAS, BILIRAKIS 
and all my colleagues on this important 
amendment to prevent this sale. 
I now strongly urge the Senate to maintain 
this key provision in the final passage of the 
National Defense Authorization Act, and take 
special note of the wide bipartisan support for 
this measure in the House. We must continue 
to hold Erdogan accountable for violations of 
U.S. law, human rights, and the security of our 
ally Greece—not reward him.

CELEBRATING

RETIREMENT 
OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROB-
ERT SCOTT VOLKERT, USMC 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS

Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, it is my 
distinct honor to recognize a true American 
Patriot, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Robert 
Scott 
Volkert, USMC of Verona, New Jersey. This 
evening he will gather with friends, family, and 
fellow service members to celebrate his retire-
ment after 27 years of distinguished service in 
the United States Marine Corps. 
As the Executive Officer and Chief of Staff 
for the Presidential Helicopter Squadron, 
HMX–1, and during his long tenure at the 
White House, Lieutenant Colonel Volkert was 
entrusted with the lives and safety of four U.S. 
Presidents, including Presidents George W. 
Bush, Barack Obama, Donald J. Trump, and 
Joseph R. Biden as the pilot and eventually 
the Operational Test Director of Marine One 
and Marine Two. 
When I started at the White House in 2006, 
Lieutenant Colonel Volkert was one of the first 
people I met, and he went out of his way to 
make sure that I felt at home and that I had 
the tools I needed for success. He has be-
come a dear friend of mine over the last 17 
years, and I can say with certainty that his 
successor has some big shoes to fill. 
Lieutenant Colonel Volkert is an incredible 
leader with an unwavering commitment to his 
country, and I would be remiss if I did not also 
thank Lieutenant Colonel Volkert’s wife, Kathy 
and his son, Jack, for their sacrifice and un-
wavering dedication to our country as well. I 
stand here today to thank Lieutenant Colonel 
Volkert for his service to our great nation and 
to wish him the best of luck in his next en-
deavor.

degree 
in 
military 
operational 
arts 
and 
sciences at the Air Command and Staff Col-
lege. Continuing to diversify his education, the 
Colonel received a master’s in national re-
source strategy from the Industrial College of 
the Armed Forces at Fort Lesley J. McNair in 
Washington, D.C., and a master’s in human 
relations from the University of Oklahoma. 
Beginning his career in the military as a 
Second Lieutenant in 1989, Colonel Mooney 
quickly moved up the ranks, becoming a First 
Lieutenant by 1991 and a Captain by 1993. 
Assuming the positions of Major in 2001 and 
Lieutenant Colonel in 2006, he has dutifully 
served as Colonel for the past 11 years. 
Throughout his extensive career, Colonel 
Mooney has held a variety of logistics posi-
tions at the wing level and has extensive staff 
experience at the major command level, 
Headquarters Air Force and Joint Staff Levels, 
including Assistant Director of Global Logistics 
Strategy at the Pentagon, Director of Oper-
ations and Logistics Alaskan Command Head-
quarters and Senior Operations Manager at 
Luke Air Force Base. Before assuming his 
current position as Department Chair and As-
sistant Professor at the National Defense Uni-
versity in Washington, D.C., Colonel Mooney 
served as the Vice President of Logistics and 
Engineering and Force Protection Air Force 
Space Command Headquarters at Peterson 
Air Force Base in Colorado. In this position, 
he led a 100-member logistics and engineer-
ing team and spearheaded the policy and 
guidance for a 9 billion space lift and satellite 
program, which supported 38,000 space pro-
fessionals and 130 space systems located at 
over 100 sites worldwide. 
Using his plethora of leadership experience 
from his previous roles, Colonel Mooney now 
serves our country in a different way in his 
role as an assistant professor at the National 
Defense University. He has remained dedi-
cated to preparing his students for success 
following graduation teaching graduate-level 
courses to 300 high-performing senior military 
officers, international fellows, and Department 
of Defense and Agency civilians annually. 
As the Deputy Director, he led military and 
civilian personnel responsible for the mainte-
nance and lifecycle sustainment of 130 space 
and cyber systems through the executing a 
$1.5B Weapon System Sustainment budget. 
He oversaw the programming and policy im-
plementation for the command’s $23B physical 
plants, which includes 29 million square feet of 
facilities, seven major installations and two 
coastal Space launch ranges. In addition, he 
directed policy development for the com-
mand’s integrated defense, resource protec-
tion and physical security activities in support 
of 2,100 security forces members and 20 high 
priority resources. 
Colonel Mooney’s extensive military career 
has earned him multiple awards and decora-
tions throughout the years, including the Le-
gion of Merit Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, De-
fense Meritorious Service Medal, National De-
fense Service Medal with bronze star, South-
west Asia Service Medal with bronze star, and 
the Humanitarian Service Medal. 
On a personal note, Nathan is a childhood 
friend from Selma and a dear personal friend 
who grew up in the same neighborhood as me 
and my brothers. Nathan has always been a 
smart, focused, and purpose-driven individual. 
Through hard work, natural abilities, faith, and 
the loving support of his wife, Chevette, Na-
than has been a valued member of our mili-
tary and a tremendous patriot. Words cannot 
express how proud I am of Nathan and his 
meritorious service to this nation, and I wish 
him the very best in his future endeavors. We 
are a safer and more secure nation because 
of his exemplary service. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District and a grateful Nation, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing the extraor-
dinary leadership and service of Colonel Na-
than Mooney II and his contributions to this 
Nation as a distinguished member of the

HONORING THE TERRELL COUNTY

Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I

under the leadership of its President, The 
Reverend Ezekiel Holley as it prepares to cel-
ebrate its 27th Annual Freedom Fund Banquet 
on Saturday, July 16, 2022, at 5:00 pm at 
Terrell County High School in Dawson, Geor-

The theme for the National NAACP Organi-
zation for this year is ‘‘This is Power.’’ For 
many years, the Terrell County Branch of the 
NAACP has asserted its power on behalf of 
freedom and justice in Southwest Georgia. 
This power has been asserted through voter 
registration, advocacy on behalf of minority 
groups and supporting young people as they 
have gone on to pursue their educational 
dreams at various colleges and universities 
across our Nation. 
The Terrell County NAACP has long been 
at the forefront of voter education and mobili-
zation. They truly understand that a ‘‘voteless 
people is a hopeless people.’’ Their voter ef-
forts have helped to register thousands of vot-
ers in the Terrell County area who have exer-
cised their power through the ballot. 
The Terrell County Branch has also been a 
leader and an advocate on behalf of those 
who have been discriminated against by var-
ious entities in the surrounding communities. 
The Branch has held marches and demonstra-
tions on behalf of the voiceless in their fight 
for justice and equality. Moreover, the organi-
zation has not been afraid to take on any enti-
ty that they believe has not been fair in its 
dealings with individuals or groups. The orga-
nization has exemplified the words articulated 
by Dr. King when he said that ‘‘The time is al-
ways right to do what is right.’’ 
Education has been at the forefront of the 
mission of this branch as well. The Branch is 
keenly aware that ‘‘Education is the passport 
to the future; it belongs to those who prepare 
for it today.’’ This organization knows that our 
young people are our future doctors, lawyers, 
scientists, engineers, mayors, governors, con-
gress people and civil rights activists. The 
Branch understands that we must invest in our 
future. And that is why over the years, they 
have given out thousands of scholarships to 
deserving young people to pursue their 
dreams of improving the quality of life for 
themselves, their families, and our commu-
nities. 
The Terrell County NAACP has served as a 
leader in the community and across the state 
in fighting for justice and equality. For decades 
it has been under the fearless and stellar lead-
ership of Reverend Ezekiel Holley. Madam 
Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and 
me, along with the more than 730,000 people 
of the Second Congressional District in hon-
oring and commending the Terrell County 
NAACP and its tireless president, Reverend 
Ezekiel Holley, on the occasion of their 27th 
Freedom Fund Banquet and for their achieve-
ments, service, and public distinction.

HONORING THE LIFE AND FAITH-
FUL 
SERVICE 
OF 
DR. 
PAUL 
CHINCHEN 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the Lord calls 
us all for His purpose according to his plan. 
Some are called to heal, such as doctors and 
nurses; others are called to instruct, such as 
teachers and professors; and some are called 
by God to dedicate their lives to spread the 
Gospel to the world, such as ministers and 
missionaries. Each of us has a purpose in 
God’s plan and that small role is monu-
mentally important in our service to our Heav-
enly Father and our family in Christ. 
When I met Paul Chinchen, I knew his role 
in God’s plan was different. I met a man 
whose role was not simply as one who cared 
for others, as a missionary, or as a leader. His 
role in God’s plan was bigger. God had cho-
sen him to do all of these things and much 
more, and in our meeting I could see that the 
Lord worked through Paul to accomplish His 
mission. In working to expand the African 
Bible College to Malawi and Uganda, the Lord 
worked through Paul to develop a place for 
thousands to learn in order to better them-
selves and their communities. By developing 
the ABC Mission Hospital in Malawi, Paul built 
a facility where doctors and nurses could work 
to heal and comfort those who had fallen ill. 
As a missionary, Paul worked to spread the 
Word of God to Africa. I am inspired by Paul’s 
words that exemplify his work so well. ‘‘Do 
something you love, do something engaging, 
and do something now.’’ 
1 Chronicles 16:24 calls us to ‘‘declare His 
glory among the nations, His marvelous deeds 
among all peoples.’’ Paul’s life was a testi-
mony to people across the world of the great-
ness of our Heavenly Father. In the New Tes-
tament, John encourages the Church not to 
love with words or speech but with actions. 
Paul’s life is an example to everyone who 
knew him of how to serve through our actions. 
The great state of Mississippi is proud to 
call Paul one of its own. I am honored to have 
known Paul. Although his mission on this 
earth is complete, I have faith that the Lord 
will continue to use Paul’s life and his example 
as a part of His divine plan. I will continue to 
be humbled by his incredible service to our 
Lord and grateful for his life. Paul’s life is an 
example of how to serve others, boldly sharing 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations, and 
of the great deeds that men can accomplish 
when the Lord works through those that He 
has chosen for His plan.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
HERSHEL ‘‘WOODY’’ WILLIAMS 
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the legacy of Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ 
Williams. Williams was born the youngest of 
11 children on a dairy farm in 1923 in Quiet 
Dell, West Virginia. In 1943, Williams enlisted 
in the Marine Corps and was sent to train at 
Camp Elliott in San Diego, California as a 
demolition man in the use or flamethrowers. 
He served at the Battle of Iwo Jima with the 
21st Marines, 3d Marine Division. During the 
battle, Chief Warrant Officer 4 (Ret.) Williams 
displayed a ‘‘valiant devotion to duty’’ and 
service above self as he ‘‘enabled his com-
pany to reach its objective’’ by charging 
enemy fortifications 5 separate times with his 
flamethrower. 
On October 5, 1945, President Truman 
awarded Williams with the Medal of Honor for 
his actions, stating in his citation ‘‘Cpl. Wil-
liams’ aggressive fighting spirit and valiant de-
votion to duty throughout this fiercely con-
tested action sustain and enhance the highest 
traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.’’ 
After World War II, he spent the rest of his 
life giving back to veterans and Gold Star 
Families, he worked for the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) for 33 years as a Vet-
erans Service Representative, allowing him to 
continue serving veterans and their families. 
Williams also established the Woody Wil-
liams Foundation to continue to serve Gold 
Star Families, and to date, the Woody Wil-
liams Foundation is responsible for estab-
lishing 104 Gold Star Families Memorial 
Monuments across the United States with 
more than 69 additional monuments underway 
in 50 states and 1 U.S. Territory. 
Woody Williams’ selfless sacrifice as a 
World War II veteran, champion of service to 
Gold Star families, and was the last surviving 
Marine from World War II to wear the Medal 
of Honor. The Nation mourns the passing of 
this proud son of West Virginia. 
He is a true embodiment of ‘‘The Greatest 
Generation.’’

HONORING 
THE 
COURAGEOUS 
CUBAN PEOPLE ON THE FIRST 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
JULY 
11TH PROTESTS ON THE ISLAND 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in praise of the brave Cuban people 
who, one year ago, risked everything to de-
mand freedom in every city and every prov-
ince in Cuba. They did this knowing the con-
sequences, and knowing that they were risk-
ing their lives, livelihoods, and would likely end 
up in prison. Much of the world remains in 
awe of their dedication and courage. 
According to human rights groups such as 
CubaLex and Freedom House, more than 
1,400 Cubans were detained, including ap-
proximately 45 children, in the wake of these 
protests. At least 700 remain in prison since 
the July 11 protests began. To date, more 
than 550 protesters have been sentenced to 
more than 4,000 combined years in prison. 
Some have been sentenced to forced labor. 
Many, including children, were handed multi- 
year prison sentences for 6 to 30 years, and 
remain in prison to this day. Some of those in 
prison today include: 
Jose Daniel Ferrer of UNPACU; Luis 
Manuel Otero Alcantara and Maykel ‘‘Osorbo’’ 
Castillo of the San Isidro Movement; Jose 
Diaz Silva of the Opposition Movement for a 
New Republic; Arianna Lopez Roque of the 
Julio 
Machado 
Academy; 
17-year-old 
Emiyosian Roman Rodriguez who shouted 
‘‘Patria Y Vida,’’ and was sent to a forced 
labor camp for five years; Duannis Dabel Leon 
Taboada, a 22-year-old barber who was sen-
tenced to 14 years; Young women such as 
Lisandra Gongora Espinosa, and the Garrido 
sisters; Loreto Hernandez and Donaida Perez; 
along with hundreds of others. 
I have been appalled by the Biden Adminis-
tration’s lack of response to this historic 
upswell of support for democratic change in-
side totalitarian Cuba. Instead of unequivocal 
solidarity with the protesters, the Biden Admin-
istration instead has barreled ahead with failed 
policies to increase revenue to the regime. It 
has lifted restrictions on remittances, in-
creased travel, and permitted support for 
‘‘independent’’ and ‘‘semi-independent’’ busi-
nesses, which do not exist in closed Com-
munist economies. For this reason, we know 
that weakened sanctions will only increase 
revenue to the Cuban military, which runs 
much of the Cuban economy including the 
tourism industry, and enrich the Cuban peo-
ple’s oppressors. 
Shamefully, the Biden Administration has re-
quested, and is in the process of imple-
menting, draconian cuts to the Office of Cuba 
Broadcasting at a time when the Cuban peo-
ple need access to outside, independent infor-
mation more than ever. And the administration 
has yet to attempt to provide internet access, 
and expand democracy programs, to assist 
the Cuban people achieve freedom. 
Nonetheless, the United States will continue 
to stand with the Cuban people, and find ways 
to cut off revenue to their oppressors. We 
must ensure that the broadcasts continue, and 
that critical support to political prisoners, their 
families, and the democratic opposition con-
tinues. Despite the Biden Administration’s best 
efforts to appease and embolden the mur-
derous regime in Cuba, the Cuban people will 
be free.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RODRIGO 
‘‘ROD’’ GARCIA 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life, achievements, and leg-
acy of Rodrigo ‘‘Rod’’ Garcia, a respected vi-
sionary, leader, and advocate, for his lifelong 
dedication to empowering the Hispanic com-
munity to achieve educational excellence, eco-
nomic opportunity, and social equity. 
Rodrigo ‘‘Rod’’ Garcia was born on March 
29, 1943, in Los Angeles, California to Gene-
vieve Hernandez and Rodrigo Garcia. He 
earned an Associate’s Degree in Engineering 
from East Los Angeles College, and a Bach-
elor’s Degree of Science in Engineering from 
California State University, Los Angeles. 
Rod served as a civil engineer for the City 
of Los Angeles and worked in Public Works, 
Building and Safety, and at the Port of Los 
Angeles. Additionally, Rod Chaired the City of 
Monterey Park Planning Commission, and 
served on the Advisory Board for the Dean of 
Engineering at California State University. 
Rod was one of the few Hispanic engineers 
amidst a tech boom in California in the early 
seventies. Despite being in the minority in the 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math 
(STEM) field, he gathered a cohort of fellow 
Hispanic engineers determined to contribute 
and diversify the STEM industry. 
In 1974, Rod founded and incorporated the 
Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers 
(SHPE) with the mission of ensuring net-
working and education opportunities for His-
panic students and professionals in the South-
ern California region. Not too long after and 
with the collaboration of Administrators, pro-
fessors, and students at California State Uni-
versity, East Los Angeles College, and the 
University of Southern California, the Society 
of Hispanic Professional Engineers estab-
lished its first collegiate chapters. 
The result of five decades of Rod’s high- 
spirited and fearless leadership propelled the 
Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers to 
reach 13,000 members and 286 chapters na-
tionwide. His unique ability of uniting commu-
nity partners and leaders around the country 
will serve as evidence that closing the STEM 
education gap and increasing the number of 
Hispanics in STEM can and will be done. 
Rod is remembered by his colleagues and 
thousands of current and former SHPE stu-
dents and professionals for his devotion and 
service to expanding awareness, access, sup-
port, and development opportunities to His-
panics in STEM to realize their fullest potential 
and positively impact society. His legacy of 
empowering 
the 
Hispanic 
community 
to 
achieve educational excellence, economic op-
portunity, and social equity will guide many 
generations to come. 
Mr. Garcia is survived by his wife, Cynthia 
Cathy 
Wong, 
and 
his 
children 
Marlene 
Tomasina Zamora, Marianne Pilar Garcia, and 
Rodrick Fitzgerald Garcia. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest sym-
pathies to the family, colleagues, and friends 
of Rodrigo ‘‘Rod’’ Garcia, and I urge all my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing his in-
credibly life of service for others.

HONORING ROBERT T. DOYLE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the significant career and 
accomplishments of Robert T. Doyle on the 
occasion of his retirement as Marin County 
Sheriff following nearly 53 years of exemplary 
service at the Sheriff’s Office. 
A Bay Area native and Marin County resi-
dent for five decades, Sheriff Doyle has dedi-
cated his life and career to the public good. In 
1966, he enlisted in the United States Army, 
serving stateside in California and Oklahoma, 
and overseas in Germany and Vietnam. Three 
years later, he left the Army to settle in Marin, 
joining the Sheriff’s Office in November 1969. 
Since 1969, Sheriff Doyle has excelled in a 
variety of roles across the Patrol, Custody, 
and Court Divisions, rising from the rank of 
Deputy Sheriff to Captain. He commanded 
both the Southern Marin Patrol Station and the 
Marin County Jail before being appointed 
Undersheriff in December 1988. In March 
1996, he was then appointed to be Sheriff of 
Marin County. He went on to win reelection to 
the role six successive times. Throughout his 
tenure, he has stood out as a true leader in 
the community, always focusing on doing what 
was best for Marin County and its residents. 
Sheriff Doyle’s stewardship of the law en-
forcement profession extended outside of his 
official role in government. He served as 
President of the California State Sheriffs’ As-
sociation, two-term President of the Marin 
County Police Chiefs’ Association, and Chair 
of the California State Sheriffs’ Legislative 
Committee. He was appointed by Governor 
Schwarzenegger to serve as a member of the 
Commission on Peace Officer Standards and 
Training, and by Governor Wilson to represent 
the State Sheriffs on the State Task Force on 
Court Facilities. He has diligently supported 
other community causes, serving as the 
Novato Youth Soccer Association Treasurer 
and as a member of the Fight Crime: Invest in 
Kids California Executive Committee. 
Madam Speaker, Sheriff Robert T. Doyle’s 
career is a sterling example of public service 
and dedication to the law and community. 
Please join me in honoring Sheriff Doyle on 
his retirement, and in wishing him the best of 
luck in future endeavors.

HONORING THE LATE NELSON L. 
GROVATT, JR. 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the late Nelson L. Grovatt 
Jr., a beloved member of our community who 
passed away on May 24, 2022 at the age of 
93. Husband to the late Thelma and the father 
of the late Alan, Nelson is survived by his 
brother Clarence, his sons, Larry and Wayne, 
and his grandchildren, Travis, Kaitlin, Tyler, 
and Trever. 
A true gentleman farmer, anyone who knew 
Nelson could speak to his heart and passion 
both for farming and giving back to his com-
munity. A lifelong resident of Rancocas in 
Westampton Township, and part of the third 
generation to farm on his family’s land, he 
worked hard until he was 82, and was particu-
larly known for his soybeans. Nelson always 
made time for people no matter how long the 
workday kept him out. He would often share 
his knowledge of farming with anyone eager to 
learn about the tractors, farming equipment, 
and what it takes to be successful. He loved 
his work and even after stepping out of the 
tractor for the last time, kept a small garden 
growing fruits and vegetables. 
Nelson was also devoted to public service 
and was recognized as a Founding Father of 
Westampton Township. Extremely active in 
both is community and church, Nelson was 
dedicated to the growth of his hometown. A 
man of unwavering faith, Nelson served as a 
Deacon at various local churches while also 
taking on numerous roles within the commu-
nity. From the beginnings of Westampton 
Township, he was a leader of the committee 
to develop its first police force and eventually 
served as the town’s first Police Commis-
sioner. He went on to serve on the Township 
Committee for 11 years and was elected 
Mayor for two years. 
Outside his work, Nelson proudly worked to 
preserve the history of the township as it 
grew, often sharing his collection of Native 
American artifacts from the Ancocas Natives 
that had settled near the Rancocas Creek. He 
also loved recalling and sharing family stories 
alongside the robust history and knowledge of 
the Rancocas community. 
Nelson was a kind soul that lived out his 
faith in all he did and never sought praise. We 
were lucky to live with Nelson as part of our 
community. My heart goes out to Nelson’s en-
tire family and for those that knew him, even 
for the most fleeting moments; he will be 
missed.

Assemblywoman 
Yvonne 
Lopez and Hispanic Federation as they are 
honored by the Puerto Rican Association for 
Human Development (PRAHD) at its 34th An-
nual Roberto Clemente Gala on July 22, 2022. 
It is my privilege to recognize the outstanding 
efforts of PRAHD and this year’s gala hon-
orees. 
Former Executive Director/CEO of PRAHD, 
the Honorable Yvonne Lopez represents the 
19th Legislative District of New Jersey and 
currently serves as Deputy Speaker of the As-
sembly. She is also Chair of the Housing

State Legislators. She also served on the 
Complete Counts Commission and the New 
Jersey Puerto Rico Commission and pre-
viously worked in the private sector as Vice 
President/Community 
Affairs 
Manager 
for 
Wachovia Banks. In her capacity at PRAHD, 
Assemblywoman Lopez oversaw the oper-
ations and management of the organization 
while cultivating community and public rela-
tions. Assemblywoman Lopez truly embodies 
the spirit of the Roberto Clemente Award and 
I join with PRAHD in applauding her leader-
ship and service to the community. 
Partner of the Year Award recipient, His-
panic Federation, echoes the mission of 
PRAHD. Its advocacy efforts, programs, and 
public education initiatives support community 
organizations and strengthen individuals and 
families. Its work assists individuals to obtain 
health insurance, citizenship and civics edu-
cation, job training, childhood literacy skills, 
college preparation, and more. In response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Hispanic Federation 
provided relief and recovery grants to local or-
ganizations and small businesses and held a 
national outreach campaign to educate Latinos 
on COVID–19 vaccines. Hispanic Federation 
continues to promote Latino interests and up-
lift the Hispanic community and its efforts are 
to be commended. 
For nearly 50 years, PRAHD has provided 
outstanding support to our local communities. 
Its comprehensive services and programs pro-
mote self-sufficiency and community involve-
ment. I applaud PRAHD for its dedication to 
improving the well-being of our communities 
and the evening’s honorees for their commit-
ment to service and action. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope my col-
leagues

Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez and Hispanic 
Federation for their contributions to the com-
munity and congratulating them on this well- 
deserved recognition by PRAHD.

Two portions of the Ordinance capture im-
portant principles that are worth recovering 
235 years later. 
Section 13 of the Ordinance notes that the 
fundamental principles of civil and religious lib-
erty form the basis upon which republics are 
erected and that they are the basis of all laws. 
Article 3 affirms that religion, morality, and 
knowledge are necessary for good govern-
ment and the happiness of mankind. 
We’ve strayed far from these truths in the 
years since the Northwest Ordinance was 
passed. 
However, it isn’t too late to recover and en-
courage a robust respect for civil and religious 
liberty while acknowledging the fundamental 
truth that religion, morality, and knowledge are 
essential for America and her people to flour-
ish.

TRIBUTE TO NORMAN LEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 15, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor renowned television producer and 
screenwriter, Norman Lear of Beverly Hills, 
California upon his 100th birthday. 
Norman Milton Lear was born on July 27, 
1922 in New Haven, Connecticut. After attend-
ing Emerson College in Boston, he dropped 
out of college to enlist in the U.S. Army Air 
Force. During World War II, he served as a 
gunner and radio operator, and flew 52 com-
bat missions over Europe, earning the Air 
Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters. 
Following his extraordinary military service, 
Mr. Lear worked in public relations before be-
ginning a career as a freelance comedy writer, 
and eventually a television and film producer. 
Norman would go on to captivate over one 
hundred twenty million viewers weekly with his 
groundbreaking television shows of the 1970’s 
and 1980’s that dealt with consequential and 
critical issues such as race, social inequality, 
and sexuality. These iconic shows include All 
in the Family, which won many Emmy Awards, 
The Jeffersons, Good Times, and Maude. 
Inspired by his uncle Jack and grandfather 
Shya’s political involvement, ‘‘that a citizen 
can matter,’’ Norman had been politically ac-
tive for years; however, in 1980, he wanted a 
more direct effect on social change, so he put 
his television career on hold to focus on polit-
ical activism. In 1981, Mr. Lear cofounded 
People for the American Way, which sought to 
build a democratic society and defend con-
stitutional values such as religious liberty, free 
expression, and equal justice from right-wing 
extremism. In 1997, Norman and his wife, Lyn 
Davis Lear, created the Lear Family Founda-
tion, which supports a wide range of nonprofit 
organizations such as the Rainforest Alliance, 
American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union, 
Ballet 
Hispanico and Planned Parenthood. In 2000, 
Mr. Lear provided an endowment for a public 
policy center that explored the intersection of 
commerce, entertainment, and society at the 
University of Southern California Annenberg 
School for Communication and Journalism— 
the center was later dedicated as the Norman 
Lear Center. A few years later, Norman found-
ed a nonpartisan youth voter registration initia-
tive called Declare Yourself. Additionally, in 
2001, Norman and Lyn purchased one of the 
few surviving original copies of the Declaration 
of Independence and shared the nation’s birth 
certificate with their fellow Americans by tour-
ing it in all 50 states during their Declaration 
of Independence Road Trip. 
Mr. Lear has received many professional 
awards and acknowledgement for his humani-
tarian achievements. These include the Na-
tional Medal for Arts from President Clinton, 
several Emmy Awards, two Peabody Awards, 
a Golden Globe Award, the Humanist Arts 
Award, Kennedy Center Honors, the Women 
in Film Lucy Award, and the National Hispanic 
Media Coalition’s ‘‘Media Icon’’ Award. In addi-
tion, he was inducted into the Television Acad-
emy Hall of Fame and has a star on the Holly-
wood Walk of Fame. 
It is my great pleasure to honor legendary 
television pioneer, and my dear friend, Nor-
